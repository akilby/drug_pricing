All these hallucinations occur without sleep deprivation. Also, my experience with benzedrex is different than others in that I don't experience much vasoconstriction issues and don't experience a come down like other people.

      " Just got out of rehab for the god damn idk how many times, now at a nice sober house, eating pretzels while laying in a nice bed, hoping I end this revolving door cycle of relapse & treatment. I've been seriously addicted to dissociative drugs since I was \\~19 years old and am almost 24 now. Particularly DXM and Nitrous were my fav, but Nitrous is too expensive so eventually I started huffing air duster pretty consistently since the age of 21. More so within the past 18 months. I could easily polish off 50+ cans in a 48 hour period of time .. that's how serious this addiction is for me. I always wished that I could just stick with DXM even though that's bad for me too, because dissociatives are so useful for depression and anxiety. Problem is that once I put any drug in my body, I immediately crave duster, which in my opinion, has one of the most powerful highs out there. I hate how readily available it is and how cheap it is ($12 for a 4 pack ..) But hopefully this is my time to shine guys. Idk if anyone else struggles with addiction to duster like me but you ain't alone. We can do this together.\n",

      "One, there was a girl who was much older than me (again, I was barely 10 years old at the time) who talked to me all the time like I was a member of some famous boy band or some shit. She practically felt like she was my girlfriend (??). It went so far as to her showing me her tits for whatever reason ?? since we would chat through webcams as well. I'm not sure if this specific person counts as a pedophile, but I was 10 and she was well into being a teenager.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second and most obvious thing is way more disturbing. I started talking to this older guy, well into his 40's, just shooting the shit and what not. Again, I just thought I was cool and interesting and thought nothing of it. Conversations started off totally normal, but over time, while at the moment was unaware, showed obvious signs of grooming and 100% being a pedophile. So some things he told me was that he was a therapist in his 40's and worked with children (probably to make me feel like him talking to me wasn't weird). Then there was a point of him telling me about this great relationship he has with one of his clients who is my age .. doing things like taking him to titty bars and the like. He made statements like, \"he wasn't that interested but I can tell you would have loved it.\" So I lived in Maryland at the time and this guy lived in California IIRC. Eventually, he would constantly ask if I wanted to hang out with him. Again, I'm 10 and am not making the connection that there has to be something not right about this person. He would over and over tell me he will gladly pay for a plane ticket for me, send it to me, and pick me up at the airport so we could hang out for the weekend. Insanely big red flag there. I didn't think much at the time and did not go through with it, but I can see how someone my age might be enticed by an adult taking interest in them (especially if you feel your parents are giving you that) and taking the guy up on that offer. I eventually quit the whole YouTube thing and talking to people online not much later, but I sometimes think where the fuck that guy is nowadays. Did his plan ever work on someone?? Is he locked up for trying it with someone? Who fucking knows. It's pretty obvious using my brain now that this guy had every intention on just straight kidnapping me and doing who tf knows what with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah so this is a weird story but hopefully this read made sense or was interesting. This isn't some shit like \"omg hide your kids from the internet.\" Just make sure to your kids are aware that adults who take a strong interest in a child and want to hang out with them is beyond normal and if they know one like that in person, the police should be called to investigate that person. Anyways, hope you enjoyed the read.\n",

      "title: Curious how many different meds you guys went through before you were prescribed an MAOI? Also, what was it like when you first noticed the MAOI working?\n",
      "I am a good candidate for MAOI's and will most likely be prescribed one in the near future. My last regular psychiatrist exhausted all his options and personally did not feel comfortable prescribing one to me because he had such little experience but he referred me to a University that has a really in depth psychiatry department and said they would be my best bet for getting on an MAOI. I have taken way too many different meds and with little results. I am currently on Nortriptyline (Pamelor) 100mg/day and the only difference I notice is anxiolysis, but nothing really different with my depression. In the past I have taken the following medications in no specific order, some in combination with one another, and most going up to the maximum dosage. Lexapro, Celexa, Effexor, Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Abilify, Zyprexa, Viibryd, Lamictal, Gabapentin, and possibly another or two I can't recall at the moment. What did you guys try before MAOI's were suggested? Also, how long did it take to notice it was working and what let you know that it was working?\n",

I've been really pestering my psychiatrist about MAOI's as I've tried everything but they're exhausting the last few options before he makes a firm decision (although he says I seem like a good candidate for them).

But fuck man, why does something so cheap .. so easily accessible .. have to feel so good. I have done literally every drug ever. Weed, alcohol, psychedelics, DXM, ketamine, Nitrous, crack cocaine, heroin, benzos etc etc. If it exists, I've tried it. My drugs of choice have always been dissociative drugs. I think I'm drawn to them because they have such potent antidepressant effects and I have suffered serious depression since the age of 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "So on to my demise. Don't try this stuff. I remember when I first got into whippets man, I couldn't control myself. It was game over. It feels insanely good to me. I can just sit in my room and be in my own world and blast music and be in another dimension. Then here comes the duster. I remember the first time I tried it. I was in an IOP program after ending up in the hospital 2 times for drug related shit. I bought a can from Home Depot, brought it home, just figured I'd try it. First blast and I just felt done for. Feels so similar to nitrous, except the euphoria is much more intense. I've never felt so good in my entire life. The euphoria on this stuff is just unreal. It takes you to a whole other dimension. I only tried about a cans worth before my parents sent me to rehab (for abusing DXM and Deschloroketamine to excess, not duster). I didn't think about duster for a while because that high wasn't totally burnt into my brain yet. I moved into a sober living house and met up with a guy I went to rehab with and he said he had a cheap place for me to stay. Awesome! My own place. Even cheaper than the sober living. Well of course when I moved in, I relapsed the day I moved in. Started doing DXM and drinking again. Then I decided .. for whatever reason .. to go out and buy some duster. I just wanted to try it again. Big mistake. One blast and I felt done for. I felt like I need to feel this way for the rest of my life. I cannot describe the euphoria. You get this really warm sensation all throughout your body, you feel completely relaxed, and the euphoria is honestly comparable to smoking crack and hitting a whippet at the same time. In the beginning of this downward spiral, I could make one can last me several hours. Next thing I know, I'm polishing off a 4 pack of duster everyday after work. I felt powerless over it. Somehow, I had the willpower to stop on my own. I eventually just went to drinking everyday. Definitely not good, but it's better than duster.\n",

Then my addict brain immediately said, \" you need to buy duster.\" Again, now I'm huffing easily a 4 pack or more of duster a day. Eventually I get kicked out of my place because I OD'd on heroin. Get sent back to rehab by my parents and am in and out of treatment facilities for a few months and go back to live with my Dad. Literally 2 weeks after getting out of treatment, I relapse on duster on my birthday and get arrested because I passed out in my car in a Walmart parking lot and woke up to the cops knocking on my car window. During this period of living with my Dad, I'm doing everything and anything I can possibly do to afford more duster. I got a job that I lost but got a paycheck for \\~$200 and literally go on a ridiculous binge on duster in my car at the Walmart parking lot. I easily huffed over 50 cans in a 48 hour period of time. I seriously couldn't stop. Several times my Dad would kick me out and I'd walk to Walmart and steal over hundreds of $'s worth of duster and just huff it in an alley way, surrounded by dozens of empty cans.

      "I feel hopelessly addicted to this stuff and I can't find much reason to really care. I'm specifically addicted to DXM and Nitrous Oxide but have used plenty of Ketamine and Air Duster (Difluoroethane). I'm a loner, out of touch with any past friends, and typically just enjoy doing dissos, listening to music and just being in my own zone. I don't enjoy much anything else. When I was 16 (I'm 22 now) I developed Depersonalization Disorder from what I'd call some traumatic experiences (in my opinion). I've also suffered serious Depression since age 7 and these two conditions just wreak havoc on my ability to enjoy life. Dissociatives take away both my Depression and Depersonalization when I use them which is why I struggle to stay away from the stuff. I've been sober for over 2 months (not by choice) living in a sober living place. I just can't imagine the second I get my own place that I won't go out and buy DXM and start dosing again. It seems unfair to be sober if I always feel miserable and this is the only stuff that makes me happy. I'd be okay with dying early if I can live my life happy or at the very least, content.

      "I'm a recovering drug addict and live in sober living right now but being totally honest with myself, I feel there's no possible way I can ever quit DXM. I don't know how. This drug does something to me that is so unique that is unparalleled to any other drug on this planet. I've done just about every drug you can think of ... Nitrous, Air Duster, Heroin, Crack, Ketamine, Adderall, etc etc you name it. I've done it. I can quit everything but this drug. This shit just feels like medicine to me, not just a drug to get fucked up on. It takes my depression and depersonalization away. It makes me feel like an actual human being. It makes life feel like it's worth living. It makes me in touch with my emotions. I feel clear. I feel like I know what I want and how to get it. I just feel genuinely happy. How can something be that good? This shit just hits all the right receptors in my brain and turns a depressed, numb, barely functioning person into a happy go lucky human being. I've been sober over 2 months now and still think about DXM. I just don't see any way out of this. I've found nothing to replace this with. 12 step program doesn't help. Therapy/counseling doesn't help. No med I've tried helps and I've tried a lot. Does anyone relate. I feel there's no way I'm not going to use this to some degree the rest of my life. I'm not in a position now where I can use, but I know once I get a decent job and live on my own again, there's no way I'm not going to dex again. I just see no way out. Does anyone relate? \n",

      "I want to preface this by saying in no way do I condone the use of any psychoactive substances and I understand that everyone reacts differently. HOWEVER, this is something that not only I personally experience, but one of my friends who suffers from DPDR and Depression like myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick summary of myself before I get into it. I have dealt with severe, suicidal depression since the age of 7 and have had dissociative experiences since early childhood but did not develop chronic DP/DR until I was about 16. I am now 21 (turning 22 in less than 2 weeks) and have improved a lot in terms of DP/DR but still deal with serious Depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, so have you guys heard of Ketamine being studied as a treatment for depression? Well, I have used drugs since I was 14 and eventually got into dissociative drugs (i.e. DXM HBr and Ketamine) when I was 18 and found out something very unique about my experiences. Dissociative drugs, for anyone who has used them, will tell you they have a very profound effect on Depression for a good amount of people. DXM especially because it has a longer half life and has very potent effects on serotonin. Not like MDMA where you feel drained or kinda meh after the experience. Dissociatives give you an afterglow (for most people) where you feel relief from depression and anxiety for up to 24 hours after the high wears off. The very strange thing is that in my experience with abusing drugs like DXM and Ketamine is not just Depression/anxiety relief, but a complete removal from DP/DR. Sounds weird right. This is a DISSOCIATIVE drug, meaning it produces DISSOCIATIVE effects .. however .. I get (so does my friend) a paradoxical effect where my DP/DR goes AWAY completely and can last for quite some time after the high wears off. The length tends to depend on how well my life is going afterwards. If I start piling up stress again and get out of that positive, connected mental loop, I tend to go back. But .. my DP/DR OVERALL has lessened and I find I can get out of it if I really focus. My thinking behind this involves a couple things. One, I am already dissociated so a drug that produces those effects can't make me feel more dissociated than I already am. Two, dissociatives share that spiritual/emotional aspect like LSD and Mushrooms but have a unique component of preventing any serious anxiety/panic and I feel like I can truly take a deep breath. ahhh. In. Out. Peace. I start to become more aware of my body, which then through breathing techniques, I can fully relax and reassociate myself with my body, thoughts, emotions, and environment. I feel completely present. I feel alive. I feel .. back. Completely removes all these filters my mind has created and allows me to come back to reality. I don't believe it is a DIRECT effect of the drug, rather it is indirectly caused because of the effects the drug has and with proper relaxation techniques, I can actually come out of DP/DR. It's not a CURE. I thought I was unique until one of my really good friends who deals with what I deal with too said THE SAME EXACT THING. It absolutely blows my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now .. in no way am I condoning doing this. YOU may not experience this. HOWEVER, I am simply sharing my experience with this class of drug and how this clearly needs to be studied. SOMEHOW. Maybe find medium level dosages for people and using them in conjunction with a therapist. I don't know. \n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone else has experience with this, feel free to share. Every single time I've come out of DP/DR for a good amount of time, it always happened after tripping on DXM. Every single fucking time. I just felt I needed to share this with you guys. \n",

      "I've been to several inpatient places and the last place figured out I need to focus on my mental health (really severe, lifelong depression and Depersonalization Disorder) as opposed to substance abuse because my mental health is what is causing or at least driving my addiction. I feel like I could do without drugs to some degree, the issue is that I just feel like plain shit .. day in and day out. It never gets better and I've had serious suicidal depression since I was 7 years old and am now 21 (3 weeks I'll be 22) and once I found drugs, it was a game changer in my life. After experimenting with so many different substances I can't count on 4 hands the different ones I've done, my favorite .. are dissociatives. Why? Ever heard about Ketamine being studied for depression. That's why. Well, DXM is very similar to Ketamine except it has much more potent action on serotonin and has a much longer half life and is fucking over the counter. Second favorite being Nitrous Oxide and Air Duster but I can easily do without those. Those are just wonky drugs when I'm looking to get weird. But the DXM or Ketamine? It is so fucking hard to stay away and that drug has given me this feeling I've never had before that feels more than just a drug. It feels like a state of being that is attainable without drugs, but all the shit I got going on in my mind, I don't feel like I can attain it without DXM. It completely rids me of depression, anxiety, Depersonalization, etc for DAYS after doing it. It literally fixed my issues and no other drug on the planet has given me this feeling of being truly alive. Not coke. Not heroin. Not adderall. Not shrooms. Not LSD. Not molly. Those are all fun, but DXM wasn't just a hallucinogen. It was legit medicine. It literally fixed my depression as long as I kept doing it. It didn't have to be everyday. Every other day or every 3 days. Kept the dosages below full blown trips. Just to get that magical, ALIVE feeling. When I got back into it again a few months ago, I was like \"holy shit, I'm back.\" I felt in the moment. Happy. Content. Present. Alive. Welp, been bouncing around rehabs for several months and now I'm finally out but god damn is it hard... I'm back on SSRI's but I just feel like they can't suffice. I've been on max dosages before of other meds and while they kinda helped, it didn't compare to DXM. I feel unable to feel fully connected to myself and benefit from therapy either without DXM. It makes me so in tune with my thoughts and feelings and feel safe to articulate it to others. The way it makes me feel, I'm perfectly fine taking it forever even if it fucking kills me down the road. I've been without it for several months now and I'm almost debating using it again even though it's dangerous to combine it with SSRI's. I just feel like I'm time traveling until the next time I do DXM where I get that \"woah I'm back\" feeling.\n",

      "I just got out of my 5th inpatient addiction center today .. and it's so fucking hard to stay sober. Drugs are the one thing I know that make me feel good without a doubt but they of course just result in negative consequences but idk if I can do it. My thoughts are consumed with thinking about planning my next high without getting caught and almost EVERY FUCKING DREAM I have is me getting high or trying to get high. Drives me nuts. This go around in treatment, they determined that my mental health is what drives my addiction and not the other way around so I'm going to get counseling again and continue to see a psychiatrist instead of IOP or a halfway house. When I got home, I remembered I had pam spray and tried huffing it and just got a mild buzz .. like wtf is wrong with me? Why the fuck can't I just stop doing this shit. Ever since I started doing drugs 7 years ago, it's been implanted in my brain .. core belief .. that I'll die doing drugs. That whatever consequences come from it are worth it because it's all I know that works. At the same time, I feel like I can't keep doing this to myself. My last bet with getting help right now is living with my Dad and if I get caught using, I'll get kicked out and have nowhere to go. I have no job right now, I'm in debt, I have pending charges against me, etc. Idk, I'm just ranting right now. Anyone else struggle with this shit? I'm just getting such bad cravings right now and wanted to get this off my chest. \n",

      "Never in my life have I felt like any substance has had such a huge grip on me besides fucking air duster. Nothing. It's the only drug I've ever had serious cravings for even weeks/months of not using it. I have suffered really bad depression since age 7 and have Depersonalization Disorder as well which is why I love duster so much. I watched this episode of intervention with this guy Matthew who huffed duster and he explained it perfectly. It feels like everything is in its right place. I feel completely at peace. I feel connected and a part of this world. Nothing matters when I'm on it. I just sit there huffing away and just enjoy how amazing it makes me feel despite any and all consequences it brings me like getting arrested or getting sent back to rehab. I've never gotten such an effect from any other drug in my life which is why I struggle to quit. Nitrous comes in at a very close second but whippets are too expensive. I've blown through $250 on whippets in a day easily. Just sitting there with thousands of them on the floor, practically swimming in them. But with duster, it's cheaper, more intense, and lasts longer. \n",

      "Anyone else struggle with this? I fucked up today which is why I'm posting. I just got out of rehab not too long ago and moved in with my Dad and got a hold of money and of course bought duster and couldn't help myself and he caught me in my room huffing away, totally blasted, vomit on the floor .. Now I have to go back to inpatient rehab. I do genuinely want to quit but I've struggled with such serious unhappiness forever (suicidal since age 7) that I just feel completely hopeless in ever being truly happy. It's so hard. When I'm sober, I have no energy and don't want to do anything. I normally just lay down all day and mindlessly browse the internet or watch TV. I need help, I just don't know if I can do it. I don't know what it will take for me to get sober. My life would actually be easier to stay clean because I have so many consequences for what I've done but I just have no hope for the future. Then when I go to rehab, they get pissed because I lay down all day and don't understand how seriously depressed I am and how it takes so much energy just to move. I got kicked out of a PHP because I was too depressed .. I don't want my story to end with me dead next to empty cans of duster but I just don't really see any other way.\n",

      "I struggle really bad not just with my drugs of choice (dissociative drugs like ketamine, DXM, nitrous, duster,etc.) but also with consuming a lot of caffeine and nicotine. I'm still trying to get the first part down but even when I lived in a halfway house a year ago, I still found myself reaching for lots of coffee and smoking lots of cigarettes. It's very difficult to imagine life without any drugs, even if they're weak ones like caffeine or nicotine. Is using these really considered sobriety? I mean, every 12 step meeting has coffee and 90% of everyone there smokes or dips. I'm obviously not getting blasted on these substances but at least for me, I still consider this substance abuse if I'm being totally honest with myself.\n",

I've found myself just naturally swallowing as opposed to spitting because I feel I get a better buzz, it tastes good, and my spit has a lot of mucus in it because of my allergies so it's always messy. Should I not be doing this? I know lots of people use mud jugs and spitting is a part of what people think of when it comes to dip but I just swallow it. Input?\n",

Maybe I just didn't know how adderall really effected you? My only real stimulant experiences are the few times in the past where I've done propylhexedrine at 500mg doses and I remember the tingles I'd get starting from the roof of my head and trickling down my whole head and the surges of pleasurable adrenaline. Also I went through a period where I was smoking crack a few times a week at decent doses for about a month or so but I haven't touched any of that for a while. I weigh about ~150lbs, so I'm not wickedly heavy by any means. Do you feel like I should have felt more and maybe have a high tolerance naturally or do you think I just didn't take enough?

      "title: An Honest Post About Inhalants I Think Is Worth Making For Anyone Considering Them\n",
      "Idk if anyone is going to bother reading this, but this is my honest and hopefully unbiased post on inhalants and things you should know about them. I want to of course preface this post and any post I make in r/Drugs that I do not condone the use of any drugs at all whether it is pot or inhalants. In me trying not to be unbiased, I will not tell anyone how to live their life and what decisions to make, but I will say given everything about this class of substances (some refuse to acknowledge them as actual drugs) that I highly discourage anyone from attempting them. I also want to say that I am not including Nitrous Oxide or Diethyl Ether into this post as most would agree they don't fall into what is typically defined as an inhalant. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I want to get right off the bat before I delve into much, is that the big thing I am not for is misinformation or just straight up lies. The biggest thing you will hear about inhalants is that their effects are a DIRECT result of oxygen deprivation and this is simply not true. I am not saying that these class of drugs don't do this, I am just saying that the high is not a direct result of this. NOW, I guess I can't speak for all inhalants, but I know at least for MOST, this is just simply not true. Huffing air duster has different psychoactive effects than inhaling butane and huffing starting fluid (typically a mixture of Diethyl Ether, Butane, and Heptane) has different effects. If the high was caused simply from hypoxia, they would have the same exact effects. \n",
      "\n",
      "Why should you not use them? I'll say some things that are just facts on how these drugs work and the damage they do and then follow it up with my personal experiences with using such substances. First and foremost is this term called sudden sniffing death syndrome. This is when someone attempts to get high on an inhalant and then dies pretty much immediately .. whether it be first time ever trying it or their 100th time trying it. Inhalants CAN cause sudden cardiac arrest. I believe from what I've read, that inhalants screw with the electrical signalling of the heart and can cause random fatal arrhythmias (your heart rate randomly skyrocketing to over 200bpm) or your heart just stops altogether. No one is immune to this and can happen your 1st time or your 1000th time doing it. You never know which is why they say getting high on inhalants is akin to playing russian roulette. Another issue with inhalants is that certain inhalants like air duster or huffing butane from a pressurized nozzle can freeze the lungs and cause you to die. The chemicals are typically very cold when being released from the can and can not only freeze your lungs, but cause frostbite on your lips, hands, fingers, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now on to the topic of brain damage. It is without a doubt that using inhalants can cause brain damage to some extent whether mild or extreme depending on which is used, how long it's used, and certain almost fatal reactions to it. The big one is when someone almost dies from sudden sniffing death syndrome and stops breathing and is then brought back to life but is brain dead and put on life support. Sometimes they received help quick enough to not become brain dead but are still permanently fried and have the brain of a 2 or 3 year old who will never get better and have to live in assisted living for the rest of their life. Diapers, having to be fed, bathed, etc. The person dealing with that may not have the intelligence to care, but your loved ones will and it will absolutely destroy them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another part of brain damage, which is why I said the high isn't a direct result of hypoxia, is that if this were true, you'd pretty much be brain dead after a day of continuous use. Your brain can't be without oxygen that long and your brain would fry so fast. Some examples of this are the two episodes of A&E Intervention with people huffing duster. The infamous Allison walking on sunshine girl did 8 - 12 cans a day for a prolonged period of time ( at least a year IIRC ) and she actually went on to not just become sober, but get a PhD and help drug addicts. That's not to say she doesn't have some level of brain damage, but it's not so severe that she was able to get a freaking PhD. HOWEVER, there is a difference in the level of brain damage with other inhalants, specifically with gasoline. I have heard numerous stories of people huffing that everyday for like 6 months and are now permanently fried and live in an assisted living home. Gasoline may cause way more serious oxygen deprivation than other inhalants and that's why you hear that story more often, but I don't have science to back it up. The big issue with getting scientific knowledge on the subject is just by the fact that they are so dangerous that it's really hard to study the effects on humans unless you're studying someone AFTER the fact they completely fucked themselves up after using them. \n",
      "\n",
      "These drugs are also very cardiotoxic and even people without any heart problems can die of a fatal arrhythmia. \n",
      "\n",
      "On to my personal experiences. I have personally only used duster and starting fluid and I think just these \"trip reports\"/experiences alone should dissuade you. The big and most common one people seem to use is air duster. The chemical in air duster that gets you high is called difluoroethane and is sometimes used as a refrigerant because it is cold when sprayed from some pressurized canister. With duster, the first hit makes you think WOW it feels just like nitrous! That's the first impression. But you keep hitting it and hitting it and realize this really isn't like nitrous. It feels a lot more dirty and sinister. The biggest thing I can say that should dissuade someone from trying it is that most of the high is you blacking out. You keep hitting it and hitting it and then you can tell some time has elapsed because you're not where you just were and your room looks like a mess. My headphones will be ripped out from the computer, my lamp is on the floor and partially broken, etc. and there's a 50/50 chance that while you blacked out, you vomited on the floor and most of the time you regain awareness halfway through vomiting and don't realize how absurd it is that you keep vomiting on the fucking floor until you finish. BUT, the drug is so fucking fiendish that you'll probably just clean it up and finish the rest of the can. How absurd. Then when you're all out and the high wears off, you feel HORRIBLE. Fucking depressed to the point of feeling suicidal. You feel like you have the fucking flu. Body feels cold and shaky. Stomach is upset. The bitterant in the duster stays in your mouth for hours despite trying to gargle mouthwash or chew gum. All you can do is just lie there and hate yourself for doing it, especially because you blacked out for half the high. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with starting fluid which is typically a mix of Diethyl Ether (I know I said I'd not speak on it alone, but it's a component in starting fluid), Butane, and Heptane which all three of these chemicals have their own psychoactive effects, the trip is pretty much what movies or middle aged white women drinking wine in the suburbs thinks taking LSD is like. I would spray it onto a rag and breathe it in. Huffing it is very harsh and breathing it in too hard will make you cough so I take small breaths and then take breaths of just straight air in between. What you'll first notice is relaxation. The high kicks in slowly and works its way up. I feel relaxed in an anesthetic kind of way. This is probably as unhealthy as it gets, but I mostly did it on cocaine comedowns because I found it was a sure fire way for me to not just relax, but ride out the whole comedown. You'll then start to notice your body temperature increase A LOT. You feel very warm throughout your body and your skin is hot to the touch. Then the CEV's kick in and they are out of this world. They work their way up gradually but they are fucking insane. I would listen to music and they would actually move to the music. I would see gnomes in some weird place marching like some neo nazi's and the music would work its way to the drop and all but one would disappear and grab me and when the drop comes, it would throw me and I'd be someplace else. As the trip intensifies, you begin to get very strange and wicked tactile hallucinations. I would feel the gnome grab me, I would feel the G -force of being thrown, I would feel myself sinking into the sand,etc. The most bizarre ones are when I would close my eyes and I would see a hand with the pointer finger out and it would come up to the edge of my vision and poke me and I would literally feel a finger poking my face. It didn't do it in any rhythm. A lot of the trip, at least for me, I would feel a finger poking my face. It would poke my cheeks, my eyes, my forehead, etc. I would also feel wet fingers slide across my face sometimes which was extremely bizarre. My face wouldn't feel wet after it stopped, but I would legit feel wet fingers sliding across my face. At the height of the trip, you will also get OEV that are more deliriant like and somewhat psychedelic type. A strange mix. I would sometimes hear someone running behind me and sometimes see an outline of a person running and feel the ground shaking with his running. I would also see portals opening up on my wall and strange things like that. They were extremely life like no matter how weird the OEV's were but you were able to differentiate them from reality. The thing that freaked me out the most was that sometimes my heart rate would randomly skyrocket like I mentioned in the dangers earlier like it be beating out of control like 200bpm for a little bit then go back to normal. Some other tactile hallucinations I got would be if I left my mouth open for a little bit and then tried closing it, I would feel like I just chomped on a tooth pick and literally felt the pain of being stabbed in the root of my mouth while trying to close it and would feel resistance trying to close it and would hear the snapping of the toothpick along with some weird daydream visual of seeing it snap in half. I sometimes would feel that same toothpick when trying to swallow water on it and feel the pain of it stabbing my throat. This trip is not like LSD, it's just straight bonker visuals. It was interesting, but I have no interest in doing any inhalants ever again just due to how dangerous they were. The starting fluid also left this taste in your mouth for like 12 hours of the taste of gasoline and wouldn't go away with gum either, I assume part is that the smell is on your throat and lungs too.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is my long ass post on inhalants. I again am not condoning the use of these substances. It was extremely dangerous for me to ever try them but at the same time, I don't regret them. I don't have any noticeable level of brain damage (not going to say I don't whatsoever since I can't prove nor disprove that statement) and have never noticed any of my cognitive abilities have declined. I feel though that this post serves as, in my opinion, of a more unbiased look at this class of substances and my personal experiences with them. Don't think you are immune to death or any level of damage that may follow use. No one is. Just like no one using heroin is immune to overdosing. People die from this shit all the time and plenty also suffer long term damage from what they have done. Don't look at Allison from Intervention and think that because she's doing well now that you will be too. She could have easily died or been permanently fucked up as well. \n",

      "\n",
      "Edit: One thing I really want to stress, even though it seems like common sense, is do not ever fucking do this shit while driving. When I was in rehab a year ago, one of the guys I really connected with had totaled several fucking cars because he was huffing it while he was driving, black out, and crashed his car. The last car he totaled, he blacked out and smashed into a semi truck and kept driving and then his car came to a crashing halt. The truck driver called 911 and the cops came and he was STILL huffing it while the cops were on their way and when they were there. The cops actually had to rip the can out of his hand for him to stop because he was that fucked up on it he didn't care at all. He was arrested for DUI and Hit and Run and already had several other DUI charges pending for both duster and alcohol. Seems like common sense to not do this but this does happen and if you black out, there's pretty much a 100% chance you're going to crash your car. \n",

      "Edit2: (I'm gonna copy and paste a comment I made when I posted this just in case people didn't see it. >\"Just a comment to post so I know people see it as opposed to putting it in the original post is what makes air duster so addictive. I think it is without a doubt that the people who get hooked on this either don't know the risks or they're suicidal and don't care. I fell into the 2nd category but I thankfully am not a duster addict nor have I been. I just couldn't get myself to keep buying cans to black out and vomit on myself and my floor.\n",
      "What makes the high so alluring for that 2nd category is, in a tl;dr phrase that I saw on a comment on another post, \"body numb, mind euphoric.\" Air duster takes away all cares and worries and makes me content and happy, but that's only if I keep doing it and know that I have more left. Any and all tension in your body and mind just disappears. You might feel anxious and/or stressed out about whatever and you take a hit of it and BOOM, instant relief. No worries. It's not similar to how other drugs make you feel that way. It's very unique in that aspect and is something I've never found any other drug in existence to come close to having. You'll just put music on, huff duster, and just sit there and stare into space and you're totally happy with that. You never do anything on duster. You can't watch movies because you'll just black out. No motivation to do anything really besides huff duster and just think about how awesome you feel. It's very fiendish because of that. The bad part is the more you do, the worse the comedown and the comedown is NEVER not horrible and the only thing you think is how much you regret it and also think about how you wish you had more. Insanity.\"\n",

      "title: Another Post on Recovery That I Feel Like Making\n",
      "I've recovered from severe DPDR from childhood trauma and just had some stuff on my mind I felt like sharing that can hopefully get you on the right track. I will hopefully try not to sound cliche.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing is realizing that you seriously are not going crazy. You're experiencing something that everyone else here is and while the factors that led to the development of this disorder are of course unique to each person, we still all suffer from the same thing. When I think about why I thought I was losing it, for me personally, I thought it just be easier to cope with or some weird thing than to come to grips I'm just experiencing excessive levels of stress and that this whole disorder is a result of that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next is learning to manage stress. You first need to remember and truly be honest with what in your life was stressful for you before the development of this full blown disorder which I know for a fact I had a VERY HARD time being honest with myself about. For me, I forgot how I had really bad social anxiety and how much that effected me because I was able to realize how ridiculous it was to be afraid to be vulnerable with people but felt like I couldn't control it. Then came the tough part of learning to manage my stress. I did this in baby steps. I had to really focus on my body and areas of tension. Close your eyes and breathe and try to fully relax? Notice you probably can't? I was under the false impression I was numb but really I had this weird level of subtle tension that I felt unaware of a lot of the time but couldn't shake because of some inevitable danger I felt that was always lurking and felt the need to always be prepared for. That's the issue with DPDR. There are other factors at play and the DPDR is a manifestation of it. Dissociating is actually seen as an adaptive state because it helps someone deal with overwhelming stress that they don't know how to properly soothe and move on from (whether it be anxiety, panic attacks, trauma, etc.). This part I found to take a very long time but it was very worth it. It's discouraging at first because you don't see instant results but overtime, if you practice deep relaxation techniques everyday, you are literally rewiring your psyche to start to naturally relax again. You'll find yourself able to relax deeper and deeper as time goes by. Once you feel yourself take a REAL and CALMING deep breath for the first time in forever, oh man does that feel good. Be aware of tension in your body and practice alleviating that. Don't BLOCK IT. That's dissociation. Be AWARE of it and don't be AFRAID of it. ACKNOWLEDGE it and just breathe. Allow the feeling to flow through you and like all feelings, they pass. DPDR is a feeling like all other feelings and right now we're just stuck. It WILL pass. Overtime, you will find that all that tension and stress is what is making you depersonalized. You'll come out of it. HOLY FUCK! Maybe if for a few seconds, minutes, hours, etc. but you'll be like FUCK I did it and start to take this whole recovery process seriously. It's a LOT of fucking effort. Don't allow yourself to discourage yourself. Nothing in life is easy but hard work pays off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you start to learn how to relax naturally and come out of the DPDR, you need to start being honest and take note of real stress in your life. First time I came out it was awesome. BUT, reality comes back. Those insecurities I had of myself and social anxiety, they came back. My natural inclination was to dissociate and I stayed mildly depersonalized for a bit after the first long time of being out of it. I was able to relax but the things that make me stressed came back. The problem is now that I need to address the root issues of what is making me dissociate. This is for me personally, but I dissociate because I am afraid of my own feelings and dissociation is a way to take the overwhelming stress of dealing with my feelings and shoving them so far back that I forget about what made me dissociate in the first place. I had to go deep in my past and take an honest look at the pain I felt in my past. My parents were psychologically unhealthy people and caused me pain. I had social anxiety? Why? It's not just simply being afraid to talk to people. Why would I be afraid? It's because I'm afraid of being vulnerable and the feeling of rejection or the perceived feeling of being rejected. Instead of facing my fear, I hid from it and isolated myself from the problem. The problem doesn't go away and by hiding from it, I am actually reinforcing that negative thinking. I had to realize what in my life led me to think like that in the first place and move on and properly process those feelings and then face my fears head on. By doing that, I was able to see there was nothing to fear in the first place and I feel I have successfully recovered from my social anxiety as well and can even laugh about it at times I feel kinda awkward. Instead of hiding in my shell, I'll just laugh at myself and then share with my friends what I was just feeling and we all laugh. I don't need to impress and feel accepted by everyone. That's crazy. If I'm myself, then I will find those who like me for myself and have REAL friends who I can be open and accepted by. \n",
      "\n",
      "This disorder sucks. Totally. It makes us really negative, pessimistic, nihilistic, depressed, suicidal, etc. BUT, like all feelings, it will pass. You might not believe it. You might go a while and give up then just one day, RANDOMLY, you come out of it for just a few minutes and think to yourself, WOAH, life really is beautiful and that I really should take this whole process of recovery seriously. Things take effort and recovering from this takes a LOT of it. Some will recover quicker than others and some longer than others. Don't let that discourage you. We are all human beings in this weird and mystical world we call life. Everyone has struggle. Our struggle is no more significant than someone dealing with depression or financial issues. Struggle is struggle and we all have to deal with it. DPDR robs us of the magic in life. The present moment. The vibe. The rhythm of life. However, the process of recovery has given me this appreciation of life that most others take for granted. We lived in the void. The emptiness. But once you recover, you will not regret having to go through this and the effort it took to come out of it. I don't regret having to go through this at all. It's what makes me ME. I would not be the person I am today without having gone through what I did and you guys won't be who you will be in the future had you not gone through with this. Don't let anyone including yourself discourage you. I'm done ranting but I just wanted to get this off my chest because I've dealt with this horrid shit and have recovered and just need to share with you guys that you're not alone and that you can and will recover whether you think so or not. \n",

      "Dissociatives have always been my favorite and DXM has been one of my favorites for years. I've gone through heavy disso abuse in the past so my days of SERIOUS use are kinda over. Before I went to rehab a year ago, I was doing a minimum of 400mg of DXM powder per day on top of going through about half a gram of Deschloroketamine a day. I hadn't touched dissos in over 10 months and just recently within the past month have started using DXM again but no where near as nuts as before but the magic has come back which is awesome. The one thing though that seriously bugs me about DXM .. and this is more so with really high doses or tripping 2 days in a row or 1 day on 1 day off 1 day on .. is that I feel extremely amped up to the point it's sometimes almost unbearable. I feel hot, veins feel really constricted, chest feels kinda tight. It's not like some overwhelming anxiety you get from coming down off cocaine, but I just feel super amped and it's just real uncomfortable sometimes. It makes me not enjoy using it that much because of it. I also feel like my throat is burning and chest is too, idk if it's heartburn or something because DXM is so acidic or whatever. Idk, I'm just kinda ranting but this shit really bugs me sometimes. \n",

      "I'm still coming to terms with the fact that had my roommate not walked into my room that I would have died last night. I want to preface this by saying I am not a regular user of heroin but I have used it a handful of times and to share my story of how this can happen to anyone who uses heroin and that you can in fact overdose if you don't even IV.\n",
      "\n",
      "My roommate sold me one of his $10 pills of heroin last night before he went to work. I was snorting it bit by bit the whole night. It was good stuff and I was just snorting it little bits at a time because I knew what the peak effects were like so I would stop and just chill before doing more. I had snorted about 80% of the pill at this point and went out and bought more heroin. I returned back to my house and then snorted the rest of the pill I had left my roommate sold me. My roommate was about to come back from work and had he not .. I would have died. He knocked on my door and I didn't answer. He called my phone and I didn't answer. He knew I was in my room and knocked again so he went in my room and saw me unconscious in my chair. He kept calling my name and I didn't respond. He started nudging me and I didn't respond. He started to panic when he noticed that I not only was unresponsive, but I was also not breathing at all. He dragged me out of the chair and started doing CPR and he said I started to breathe on my own but BARELY. He said I was taking short gasps of air, like 10% of a lung full at most like every 20 - 30 seconds. He dragged me into the bathroom and ran cold water from the shower to try and wake me up and was putting ice down my shirt and pants to try and wake me up. At that point, he realized I was still unresponsive and called the paramedics. They showed up and dosed me with narcan. I didn't wake up right away. I woke up minutes later .. completely confused .. soaked with water .. cold .. my hearing was completely shot .. and had a paramedic tell me I overdosed on heroin and that I had stopped breathing and that my roommate saved my life by calling 911. I was transported to the hospital where I had to be monitored for 4 hours because if the narcan were to stop working, I could re overdose and would need a 2nd dose. I literally should have died last night and I would have had no recollection of how it would have happened. All I remember doing is snorting the remainder of that pill and that's it. Lights out. Had my roommate not came in my room or have been home .. I would have died. I'm extremely lucky. Many are not so lucky. Take this as a warning. This can happen to anyone. Big or small. Dumb or smart. Full blown junkie. First time user. Occasional user. Anyone. Anyone who tries this risks this happening because you don't know the purity of each buy you make and if it has Fentanyl or not. I am one of the lucky ones who survived and I will never do heroin ever again because of this. I only did it a few times in my entire life and this will be my last. It's never been my drug of choice. I thought I was okay. I thought what I was doing would be safe. It wasn't. I would have been written off as another statistic. Dead at age 21. Heroin overdose. I lived. Some live. Some don't. Don't be the next person to overdose. It can happen. \n",

      "Dealt with this disorder my whole life from a bad childhood. I felt like I had no escape from things that threatened me so I detached for periods of time throughout my life. My last longest episode from 11th grade to a week ago .. I forgot I depersonalized myself on purpose because I couldn't bare the stress of going through the pain of life again but ended up just creating a new problem. I'm out now but life is not perfect. The same issues still exist .. I just am able to make connections now and understand what I went through and why I went through this shit and how it makes me an infinitely better person because of it. Life is fucking scary. No doubt. DPDR was just a way to cope with tough times. You'll get through it guys. You just need to be fucking honest with yourself which is the hardest thing I've ever had to do. I wanted to deny every aspect of my life and just magically be happy. You can't. Where there is pleasure, there is pain. You can't have have one without the other. You either have both or none. Life can either be a journey or a void. It's up to you.\n",

It's not like a layer is over my eyes making me feel like I'm not here. I feel like I'm there, but the world around me looks EXTREMELY foreign and unrecognizable. It appears slightly larger and in my face. Colors seem to take on a weird shade. I wouldn't say I felt emotionally numb, more like all of my emotions were so intense that I felt like I was completely unable to process anything that was happening. Periods of this level of severe derealization .. I tend to not remember most of them. I have felt this feeling on and off since early childhood and it is extremely exhausting and terrifying. People look like they are of a different species and not human anymore. Like being put on a jungle in a different planet. Everything about what I'm experiencing during these episodes is too intense and I cannot handle the intensity of it all. That's why my memory of these periods is EXTREMELY hazy because it's as if I was put in another universe and the guys from men and black flashed that light but I could only remember some of it.

      "Not to say I've felt chronic DP/DR since childhood .. I experienced episodes but didn't become chronic until like age 16 and residual effects persist to my current age (21). It's not crazy intense and wicked like initially, I've recovered a lot and have episodes where I come out. I can say I feel like an objective observer of things. I personally always felt like an outsider from things. The difference before chronic DPDR and first starting to have severe derealization episodes .. I felt human as it and most people definitely appreciated the energy I had and unique perspective on things. I was never overly attached to drama like many people, rather big or small. I was definitely neutral, but I had life too. Energy. Passion. Spirit. An identity. As my DPDR started in chronic form I became a lifeless observer. Horrible thoughts about perception of myself. I was a sensitive person and was definitely insecure growing up.. socially anxious .. psychologically unhealthy parents .. This unique perspective from these \"flaws\" or characteristics .. they were me but it was ME. I lived it. Then I felt like I started becoming seriously hyper aware of all this negative energy and I just completely dissociated. Serious derealization. That was when the anxiety and panic attacks were at an all time high. Everything was fucking surreal. I couldn't correctly perceive the external world. It wasn't far away. No. It was there, but it was terrifying. I was 100% 24/7 freaking out. Nothing looked right. It was surreal. I felt like this is just a manifestation of me not being able to accept my life as being real. Like why did all this bad stuff happen to me? I feel like I was just always on that edge .. life just kept happening and a human mind can only take so much shit man. Sometimes I almost like this chronic state of depersonalization. Not 100% in my body, emotions are very mute (I do feel some slightly like laughing), and things not having any emotional impact. I feel like I'm not longer capable feeling the world through myself. I can only get so far with coming out of it but I'll try to move past stuff, but then OLDER stuff happens, oh and that older stuff reinvites the shit of the stuff that happened after that old shit that you just thought you got past.

      "This is something I've looked up and have only seen a few people post about this on several different DPDR related sites. This is what I consider to be SEVERE derealization. Not the typical, oh things seem distant, the veil over my eyes, and I don't feel present. I specifically remember this time smoking weed with my buddies about two years ago. Now I'm not the person who had this disorder solely triggered by pot or any other drug. I'm almost 100% fine when doing any kind of drug with DPDR and I have recovered a lot. I just remember 2 years ago, I had my first SERIOUS panic attack in years. I hadn't had panic attacks for fucking years before this. I remember I wasn't feeling all that comfortable to begin with. I suffered with severe Social Anxiety before my chronic DPDR developed but I've experienced DPDR episodes throughout my whole life. I just remember after smoking some, the uncomfortability feeling started getting way worse to the point I progressed into a full blown panic attack. All of a sudden, I went through that dolly zoom type effect but it was like my whole visual perception of the world changed. I know I had experienced this feeling many times before but it was the first time in a long time this happened. Again, this happened 2 years ago and is the last time I experienced this along with experiencing a panic attack. It wasn't a 2d world. It wasn't far away. It was like in a way, I felt like I was actually in the world, but visually, everything looked so strange. It was like many people online have put it.. it was like I was seeing 3d objects against a 2d background. Like people or whatever it was .. the wall was a 2d background and the people seemed to kind of BOUNCE OUT of that background, like some super hyper 3D type shit. Kind of like a pop up book or some IMAX 3D movie. Like my depth perception was hyper exaggerated. I got both a sense of serious DEJA VU and JAMAIS VU. I know I'd experienced something like this many times and everything felt so oddly familar, but at the same .. it was like I legit didn't recognize anything. In my own best words. It was like I felt like I was seeing the world for the first time but it was so intense, huge, and in my face I couldn't accept what I was seeing. Like everything was TOO FUCKING INTENSE. TOO BIG. TOO IN MY FACE. Dare I say it? Almost too real? Like it was so in my face and intense it was too real, SURREAL. \n",

      "I'm 21 years old and so I now qualify as not just being a CDL driver (only 18 yrs old) but being able to drive OTR. I would like to hear all your opinions on this matter. The age in which I'm growing up in, technology is moving at a seriously fast pace, specifically with self driving cars. Do you guys think it is worth it to pursue this career? I love driving. I seriously do and driving semi's is seriously one of the few career paths I can personally see myself doing. I would love nothing more than to do this for a living. The only issue, like I mentioned before, is the whole ordeal with self driving cars and self driving semi's. In this day and age as me being a 21 year old, do you think long term this would be a good career to pursue or not?\n",

      "I'm not much of a drinker because alcohol really messes with my stomach, but I can tolerate a few drinks. One weird thing that always happens to me once the effects have fully kicked in, I sometimes find myself randomly crying. Not like full blown breaking down, but I'll definitely have some tears stream down my face or cry for like 10 seconds then have it go away. I kinda see it as somewhat therapeutic because every so often, I'll feel like I just want to ball my eyes out but I feel incapable of feeling deep, true sadness and it's unable to be released but alcohol breaks down some of those mental  barriers I've created and tears will come out and I'll definitely feel sad. It's not for the entirety of the effects but it will definitely happen. I was wondering if anyone else every experiences this. And maybe you experience another emotion that seems to make it's way through like built up anger.\n",

      "\n",
      "That Friday I had gotten my order of 4-aco-dmt in the mail and at around 7:30 PM I weighed out 55mg (really high dose) and took it orally. It kicked in in about 20 minutes and it just kept getting stronger and stronger. I was in my room just playing with my dog having a blast and kept saying stuff to myself, \"it should be illegal for how much fun I'm having.\" So apparently at one point I started vomiting everywhere in room and I tried cleaning it up with my clothes. I went to the bathroom where I continued to vomit and I think that's when my mom realized I was clearly under the influence of something. I don't know what compelled me to do this but apparently I took all my clothes off and just started literally destroying everything in my house. I took everything in my room and was throwing it against the wall and on the floor and wiping my clothes all over the vomit. I was ripping shelves out of my dresser and throwing them everywhere. My Mom came into my room where I proceeded to hit my vape and blow it into her face and say shit like \"smoke weed everyday\". I went downstairs where I went into our office and started ripping shelves off of our office and throw those on the ground, rip out drawers, throwing books and random shit everywhere, take my desktop and tossed that on the ground, etc etc. My Mom of course called 911 where 2 cops originally came and handcuffed me and had to help me put on my boxers. A total of 8 police officers ended up coming to my house. I apparently told them I drank 4 bottles of robitussin for some reason and that I did this because I was trying to commit suicide. They called a crisis intervention team to evaluate me and ask me why I did this and then paramedics and firefighter showed up to my house to take me to the hospital. The cops brought me downstairs while the paramedics were taking my vitals and had to keep holding me down because I kept trying to walk away and I thought they were just gonna leave because I'm like, \"yo I just wanna go upstairs and hit my vape\". I was saying complete nonsensical shit to the cops like \"yo do you watch porn? You ever been to vape dojo? This happens all the time yo. It's all about empathy man I understand you, you understand me.\" Just completely random shit. At one point I tried biting one of the cops for some reason because I thought I could literally do anything and I tried shoving my arm through one of the cops because I thought that I could somehow shove my arm through him. \n",
      "\n",
      "They walk me out to the ambulance in handcuffs in just my boxers where they lay me down on the stretcher and they had to bring two cops with me to the hospital because I kept trying to get up and move and shit. I thought they were bringing me to the hospital because there was some glitch in the matrix and that we needed to see a doctor about that and figure out what was happening. Then I thought I was in GTA and that I was trying to mod the game like change the siren on the ambulance and shit. I thought there was some weird understand between me, the paramedics, and the cops like yeah this is life this happens all the time we've all done this what's the big deal. Ambulance ride literally felt like an eternity and I thought that if I just chilled out that they would take me back home and that this was just all about me not relaxing or something. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we finally get to the hospital where I was no longer talking and just looking at people really hard into the eyes. We get to the room where I then thought that this had to do with something about the big bang theory like how the universe is expanding and expanding and now the universe is contracting and about to disappear and have a new big bang where a whole new universe would be created so I was saying goodbye to the current universe. I then thought that I was dying and that I was going to be reincarnated into a new person. Then it went back to the universe type thinking and I thought the universe was about to disappear if I just relaxed and let it happen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Eventually I sober up and I'm extremely confused as to why I'm still me because I thought this was a different universe and that I was supposed to be a different person. I asked the nurse there what happened and he said I had an overdose. I didn't believe him whatsoever, I thought he was full of shit so I just kept quiet and asked for water and went to sleep. Then I eventually realize what had actually happened and I got evaluated by some psychiatric doctors and after 24 hours of being in the hospital my Dad brought me back home and they showed me all the damage I did. We've pretty much cleaned everything up now to where it looks like nothing happened. \n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, I literally have no fucking idea why any of this happened. I've never once had a reaction to this on any drug and I'm still trying to wrap my head around all this but I figured I'd share this story as it probably be interesting for you all to read. \n",
      "\n",
      "Edit: Also when I was in the bathroom I straight up ripped the shower rod off the wall and was shoving it into the toilet and tried flushing it down the toilet, I ripped the toilet paper holder thing off the wall too and shoved that deep inside the toilet to where it got stuck. I also lost my house keys. Also at one point I took all my benadryl pills, put them in my mouth and started chewing them and ate them. \n",

In fact, I really don't enjoy eating lots of sweet food to begin with. \n",

This has all been happening, at least to my knowledge, since I was in 10th grade (so 15 to 16 years old), but has gotten progressively worse over time (am 20 years old now). I don't believe anyone in my family, at least to my knowledge, suffers from Diabetes and I'm not saying I do either or am going to I just don't understand what is up. I remember in like 10th and 11th grade it would seriously interfere with my workouts as well because my blood sugar would feel so freaking low and I couldn't continue to work out because of how seriously weak and messed up it made me feel. \n",

      "So I'm sure some of you know that some people who start meditating may start noticing they feel numb/detached and didn't feel that way before starting meditating. Now, meditation has been shown to help alleviate and treat dissociative disorders by helping people relax and ground themselves. However, some have it go the opposite way where they feel they weren't detached before meditating and now after meditating, they do feel detached. My theory behind this is that you're meditating wrong. You see, what dissociation is, is your mind literally blocking your feelings/thoughts. Now, in meditation, people try to reach that state of calm/\"emptiness\". The issue is HOW you are trying to achieve this state. When you practice meditation/mindfulness, what you're teaching your brain to do is not to block your feelings, but to allow them to flow through you and be a non judgemental observer of your thoughts. You're not feeding into your thoughts, your not blocking your thoughts, you're just letting them flow through you and letting them take their natural course of action. My theory is that the people who report feeling detached/dissociated from meditation are actively trying to block out their thoughts instead of letting them flow and not judge them. Next time you're meditating, just be aware of the feelings and thoughts that are constantly flowing through you. Don't reject them. Accept them. Acknowledge their presence but do not push them away or feed into them. Just let things flow.\n",

The only word that even describes what you're feelin is \"sigma\". When I hit sigma, it changed my life forever in such a positive way. Since hitting sigma, I have recovered from my severe Depersonalization Disorder that I suffered from since childhood. I have never felt so happy and alive in my entire life. And this isn't some afterglow that goes away. It's been over a month and I've kept this positive mental change. I felt reborn. I felt like I didn't need drugs anymore. What I mean by that is specifically the word NEED. I still enjoy smoking a bowl or two every couple months, maybe havin a beer with some friends, and will still trip. The difference now is that it's not a NEED like it used to be. Before, I felt like I NEEDED drugs to keep me sane. Now, I enjoy life in and of itself. I haven't even touched dxm or even thought about tripping since I hit sigma. Today though, I did go out and get some DXM for the firt time in like a month and a half. But it wasn't a need. It just was. Things just ARE now. Might not make sense lol but I just let life take me places now. Life is magical in and of itself. It's so weird to say this, but DXM, specifically sigma, changed my life in such a positive way.

      "\n",
      "So, this may sound bizarre to some, but I enjoy Diphenhydramine's sedating effects. It allows me to fall asleep with ease and when I stay awake while on it, I feel kinda at ease with stuff. It's not a major shift in consciousness, but it's just kinda like that effect people enjoy when having a beer or two after work. Just that slight relaxation. \n",
      "\n",
      "So to get to the point and describe my use. I have been using Diphenhydramine daily now for ~1 year. I used it on and off since like 2 years ago, but only since like .. September of 2015 I have been using it daily. I take an average of 200mg every night, not to exceed 300mg in a day, and a minimum of 150mg. So the withdrawal. I notice withdrawal effects fast, like within ~36 hours of not dosing. I feel extremely sick. I get a wicked headache, extremely sour stomach and nausea, almost to the point of puking. I'm sure I would puke if I didn't cave in and buy more Diphenhydramine. I've almost puked several times but managed to get more Diphenhydramine in my system to rid myself of the withdrawal. A simple dose of 50mg - 75mg will rid me of the horrid withdrawal. I also experience dizziness and just this general, horrible, flu like feeling. I also can't eat whatsoever because of how horrible my stomach feels. I'm convinced that Diphenhydramine withdrawal is due to the fact that Diphenhydramine has mild SRI activity, so when taken in doses that I take, especially for an extended period of time, everyday, is what is causing these symptoms. Because the thing is, the symptoms of Diphenhydramine withdrawal match the symptoms of SSRI withdrawal to a perfect T. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyone else ever experience this? It sucks, I'm probably gonna ween myself off this because it's the worst feeling knowing my body is seriously that dependent on this substance. Also, I guess this post serves as maybe a drug PSA for diphenhydramine haha. It's just so bizarre. You wouldn't expect this drug to cause such wicked withdrawal, but it does. Not everyone experiences this because I've read plenty of stuff of people saying they take doses similar to mine daily for years and never get withdrawal, and others get really bad withdrawal. \n",

I'm just at a complete loss for words for this whole situation. The doctor on the phone pretty much lied to me as well about detection times for Marijuana in saliva. He claimed it could be detected for up to 6 weeks? Um, okay, I guess if he has access to research no one else has, then okay? But EVERYWHERE I have researched, says it's only detectable for a few days. I KNOW I didn't actually fail, it's like they pretty much fucked up on purpose to try and get me to pay $150 for a mistake that's on their part 100%, and they of course have the power in this situation because they can fuck me over with getting a job.

If not, then I guess that job is out of the question and I'll straight up tell the employer if they call back that they made a mistake and want me to pay $150 out of pocket to prove my innocence but that this job is not worth $150 of my own fucking money for. If they don't believe me, then whatever because I know I didn't fail. \n",

      "I'm sure a lot of people have asked this but this is seriously frustrating me because I'll start working on a track and then a decent way through where I have tons of plugins running, samples, etc. and I'm really feeling the track and making progress, my CPU usage starts going off the fucking charts and I'm getting serious under runs and I'm at a loss for how to fix it. I studied the Image Line trouble shooting page and I seriously can't find ANYTHING that makes a significant difference. I'm like there's gotta be SOMETHING I'm clearly missing because it's not like my PC's hardware is bad. For example, my laptop runs an i7 processor and that processor I know is able to accomplish a lot, but FL is seriously slaying the complete shit out of it. This program makes my gaming desktop even go to shit. Example. My gaming rig which I've put a lot of money into croaks up on this thing. It has an AMD FX8350 processor (8core 4ghz), 8GB RAM, and a GTX 970 4GB SC Video Card and I'm getting serious under runs on even that. It's like, I can run games on that PC like GTA V on maxed out settings with graphical mods, yet FL Studio is somehow making my PC turn into something comparable to some cheap notebook. I feel like there has to be SOMETHING I'm missing in the settings. \n",

      "I have tried virtually changing all the audio settings with no success, only slight increases in performance but it still has a significant number of under runs at certain points. I've tried switching between different ASIO drivers, changing the buffer length as high as it goes, etc etc. Like does anyone else experience this same issue because I'm at a loss for words how this program is seriously that CPU intensive to the point I can't complete a track. If anyone has a help I'd sure love to try literally anything. And yes, my power settings are all on max performance and have made sure everything in the advanced tab is allowing all my hardware to run at 100% usage. \n",

      "title: Recovery. My Journey Through Severe Depersonalization Disorder and Where I'm at Today.\n",
      "Words cannot express the need for me to make this post. I feel like I need to because a lot of people with Depersonalization Disorder who recover tend to leave places like this which I 100% understand. It's scary. That's why. It terrifying to be reminded life used to be like this but this newly found appreciation and perspective on life has shown me I NEED to confront my fears and help people because I know how fucking horrible this disorder is.\n",
      "\n",
      "To start off, I was like any other human being. The world was a big, wonderful place with lots of opportunity. I did normal things like anyone else. But as life progressed, I began going through really bad shit. My parents were not very good parents, lets just say that. They treated me like shit and so of course what's your natural reaction when people treat you like shit? You react back. What does that accomplish? They react as well but because they're my parents, they can ground me and take shit away from me further making me feel horrible. So taking into account that home life, I have to manage going to school with that in mind of what my home life is. I had to pretend to the world like things were okay but obviously things were not okay. It caused me to be a fearful and also \"fake\" person. On the one hand, I was afraid of things always going wrong but I had to pretend to the world nothing was wrong. I suffered with bad depression and anxiety most of my life and experienced differing levels of dissociation from an early age. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to around high school. I start getting into drugs and what not because that's kind of a typical thing you see with people who don't enjoy their life. Smoked weed for the first time at 14 and was just absolutely hooked on chemical highs. It was pretty much all I thought about because those were the one thing that made me feel good. Some things that played into the development of Severe Chronic Depersonalization for ME was my home life, my school life, and some failed experiences with romance. I felt like the world had set me up for complete failure. I felt so shitty and never had any professional help because I never felt like I had anyone I could tell anyone about anything. I thought people wouldn't understand or believe me. \n",
      "\n",
      "So I don't exactly remember when I developed severe chronic Depersonalization Disorder, but I know it was some time I think in 11th grade. My symptoms were as follows in no particular order. Severe detachment from my sense of self and my surrounds. A sense that the world was fake and that I didn't exist. Feeling uncomfortable in my own body/outside of my body.Blurry vision where my eyes were not able to be fixated on the present moment. Zero emotions besides episodes some of extreme rage. A feeling that I would never get better. Seeing life through a filter/veil. Feeling trapped in my own head. Feeling as if I was losing my mind and that some inevitable psychosis was always at bay or that I was already psychotic. A weird sense that this has happened before, like a really odd Deja Vu/Jamais Vu feeling. What's really weird and I have read other people who experienced the same thing is that leading up to the chronic DP/DR, I felt like the world had taken on this indescribable sinister and evil vibe to it. I suffered with these symptoms chronically. Day in and day out for YEARS. I didn't understand what was wrong. It's weird because I remember thinking to myself something was so oddly different about my life but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I remember googling something along the lines of something I realized about myself which was \"I am unable to connect with people.\" That was the big thing was I remember not feeling connected to things anymore like I used to, especially other people. I felt like I was just going through the motions. Completely automated. The living dead. \n",
      "\n",
      "At age 19 I was hospitalized and put in the psych ward because I was seriously losing my grip on reality. I felt so shitty I no longer gave a shit about anything anymore so I was abusing drugs. Any and all drugs I could get my hands on which meant I was stealing prescription drugs from my parents to cope with things. This eventually led me to the psych ward where I stayed for 3 days and was then released, given a therapist and put on medication. I tried the medication route, going on even the maximum dosage of Lexapro for about 6 months and yeah, it definitely helped alleviate some symptoms, but I eventually stopped due to side effects and felt like after 6 months I got whatever it was I needed out of them. I dropped out of University because things were getting worse and I felt like I just couldn't manage school on top of everything. I started working to make some cash and help keep me busy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to now and I've made what I believe to be a 100% full recovery at age 20. I feel like an entirely new person that I never thought was possible. I was so thoroughly convinced I would never get better for the longest time and believed that my only way out of this shitty hell hole was to abuse drugs forever and to hopefully one day commit suicide. Now that I'm better, I feel no need to use drugs whatsoever and can't understand why I'd ever want to commit suicide. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some things you might be wondering. Do I feel like Depersonalization Disorder truly goes away. No. I feel like it is a part of you and you need to accept that. That was something I didn't comprehend before but now understand fully. I can feel it creeping back sometimes mildly, not as bad as before, but the difference now is that I have developed good coping mechanisms to rid myself of the feeling and reassuring myself that this is just a feeling and like all feelings, it will pass in time so there's no need to be hyper fixated on it. Now I am staying out of DP more often than going back in. Words cannot express how beautiful life is. How wonderful it truly is and to know that I was not the only person suffering from this horrid disorder and that I NEED to help others suffering. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some tips on recovery. You need to accept that DP/DR is real and it is a feeling like any other feeling. It will pass and the big aspect of DP/DR is rejecting your feelings. Your mind is actively trying to block out feelings including DP/DR instead of letting feelings naturally flow through you. Because that's what it feels like to be normal. Feelings just naturally flow though you. Practice deep relaxation techniques every single day. I don't care if it isn't help right then in the here and now, I know for a fact it helps in the long term because I know this is a big component of what led to me recovering. By practicing deep relaxation techniques every single day, you are literally rewiring your brain to learn to relax again. I cannot express how good it feels to truly BREATHE again. Holy shit, just BREATHING feels good. It felt so uncomfortable to be in my body because of the overwhelming stress. All that tension is finally relieved. So a way to help relieve this tension? Do things that relieve tension! Keep your mind occupied. Focus more on the present moment. EXERCISE! Go outside! Interact with people. Eventually, you get yourself in the habit of doing all these things you start forgetting about Depersonalization then all of a sudden you think to yourself, HOLY SHIT, wait a second. I'm FEELING stuff. Instead of getting caught of in the DP world, I've been getting caught up in my FEELINGS and REALITY without even realizing it. If you feel yourself slipping back, relax! So WHAT? It's a feeling like any other feeling and it will pass. Don't think that you can recover over night. Hardly anyone is able to do that. Recovery takes a long time. It's a process. But it's a process worth going through. I KNOW each and everyone of you can get better. I KNOW you can. Please, for the sake of yourself, if you are thinking about suicide, GET HELP. ASAP. Your life is worth more than allowing the DP to get to you. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps and reassures you guys. I will respond to comments and I hope that no matter what, I hope by reading this I have at the very least encouraged you guys to start your recovery. I believe in you guys, I'm on the verge of tears for how beautiful life is. Take care guys, seriously. I understand fully what this disorder is like and I know recovery from SEVERE DP/DR is 100% fucking possible. To infinity and beyond.\n",

Did I sleep through my whole trip? Or did I black out? It's so weird after coming to I've felt so oddly fucked up all day haha just like totally weird perceptual shift.

      "title: DXM. The 4th Plateau. My Story. Why It's Not Worth It.\n",
      "Whatsup everyone. As you can tell my the title, I will be sharing with you guys as best as I can articulate my 4th plateau experience and why those who have experienced it such as myself will tell you it's most certainly not worth it. Let me begin by first telling you that the 4th plateau resembles absolutely nothing of the first 3 plateaus. Nothing. The 4th plateau is like a completely different drug. I know drugs effect everyone differently, but the effects are similar enough for me to hopefully dissuade you from trying this. Okay, here's my story.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the previous night before trying this, I had done a moderate 3rd plateau dose so I don't know if it effected my 4th plateau trip or not. I was kind of disappointed with that trip. I wasn't sure if maybe I had a slight tolerance so for whatever reason, I decided to take a way higher dose the next night. I went to walmart and bought 3 packs of gel caps for a total of 900mg. I weigh 130 lbs so 900mg for me is a 15.2mg/kg trip. The previous night I had taken 704mg so I thought 200mg more the next night wouldn't be that big of a difference, but boy was I wrong. I got home and dosed all 900mg and laid down for a bit while I waited for it to kick in. I had also dosed 100mg DPH for potentiation. It came on like any normal trip dose. Comes on slowly as usual. As the effects started to kick in, it felt like a high 3rd plateau dose so I was thinking hell yeah this is nice. Nothing out of the ordinary. Well, slowly but surely it starts to get a lot more powerful so at this point I decided to get off my computer and lay on my bed in the dark and listen to tunes. This is where my memory gets really hazy. I don't remember how I got to this point, but I remember all of a sudden being on a whole nother dimension of fucked up. Nothing made any sense whatsoever. I was no longer human. I was having these strange thought loops that made no sense and what I remember is being this tiny thing inside my body like looping around my blood vessels (I know that makes no sense but it's the best way I can describe it) just over and over and over and the thing was I felt like I was just getting higher and higher and higher. If I closed my eyes, I would begin to astral project into completely different worlds but not thinking, \"wow this is so cool,\" it was more like \"... I literally have no idea what is going on\" with hardly any thoughts. My heart rate and blood pressure were through the absolute roof and I was beginning to worry because I thought for sure I was going to die. I thought there was no way in hell my heart wouldn't explode or just stop beating because I don't know how my heart could somehow beat that hard and fast for such a long time. I considered calling 911 but I decided against it. As I said, my memory was EXTREMELY hazy so I'm trying to organize what I remember as best as I can. So at some point, I remember coming to one of a few conclusions. I thought that either one, I was going to die. Two, I was already dead and I was stuck in some strange limbo afterlife. Or three, that I wasn't human, had never been a human, and had never existed and it was only at this moment that I realized it. At the 4th plateau, you are not human anymore and you would be convinced you were never a human. Sure, if I looked in the mirror I was inside a humans body, but ME, whatever \"I\" was, wasn't human. I was some being occupying a humans body. Physically, my body was going through hell. My breathing was extremely slow and I was kind of worried I would stop breathing at one point. When I had to go to the bathroom, ONE, if you thought you knew robowalk, think again. My limbs hardly functioned and had to grip onto something to make sure I didn't face plant. When I got to the toilet, I would stare at the toilet and not be able to pee. I had no idea how to use whatever muscles I had to make urine come out. It would probably take me ~10 minutes each time I got to the bathroom to urinate. Okay.. so at some point, I figured I would just sleep. HOW? Lol, well I figured if I just closed my eyes I'd go to bed and wake up fine. So it was at this point I don't think I actually fell asleep, it was more like I literally lost consciousness for an hour and then randomly came to, only to be just as fucked up as before, experiencing the same out of body shit and thought loops that made no sense. I don't know how long this went on for, but it slowly died down over a period of a long time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Little edit for the trip part: If I were to kind of reassociate myself into my room, I would look at something like my door and would begin to hear these voices start to slowly raise in volume and they had this extremely sinister vibe to them. I heard constant voices throughout the night that had this sinister/evil vibe to them and they would say things like, \"you're worthless, you're a piece of shit.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "More edits as I remember: I felt like for the most part of the trip that I was blind. It was like the external world wasn't there and it was near impossible to focus my eyes on it. \n",
      "\n",
      "SO, the next morning. There was no afterglow, it was more like you were still absolutely fucked up but you seriously wanted it to go away. I got extremely scattered sleep and each time I slept, I could only sleep for like 30 minutes at a time. I was no longer at the 4th plateau but was like holy shit, beyond fucked up. I was under the impression I should have went to the ER either that night or that morning because I seriously thought I had overdosed that night or that I had suffered a stroke. I felt absolutely brain dead. I had awareness of my surroundings but if you were to try and talk to me, I could hardly understand what you were trying to say. Like if you were giving me instructions on how to do something very simple, I would understand the words you said, they were clearly english words, but making sense of anything you said was impossible. My heart rate and blood pressure were still pretty high and wouldn't calm down. My head .. so this is what added to me thinking I suffered an overdose or stroke. There was this sharp electricity flowing through my head and my body. The electricity would sometimes zap through my body and I would get goosebumps every time it happened. I'm pretty sure this is because of the excessive amount of serotonin in my body but this is what gave me the biggest scare. This brain dead feeling and physical fucked up feeling lasted over 24 hours after my initial dosing and finally went away after like 36 hours. \n",
      "\n",
      "So r/dxm , this is my experience. Hopefully it made sense as best as I could make sense of it. I barely remember much of the experience because that's just what the 4th plateau is like. It's absolutely scary, nonsensical, and clearly is damaging to your body at doses like that. If you like DXM, just stick with mid high 3rd plat doses at best, no higher. The 4th plateau is like an overdose that you're able to survive. Anyway, hope you enjoyed reading that and can learn from my experience. If you for whatever reason still feel like you have to experience the 4th plateau, make sure you have absolutely no responsibilities for 24+ hours after dosing and DO NOT drive after dosing for at least 36 + hours. \n",

      "Hi RBN. I am a 20 year old male who I feel has been through a rough life and after a lot of research, I have come to the conclusion that my mother is a narcissist. I have had a really unhappy and horrible childhood growing up that no one understood and I believe both of my parents are the source of my issues, but I believe my Mom is the only narcissist. \n",
      "\n",
      "So some backstory. I have developed severe Depersonalization Disorder because of my childhood. My childhood was hell. The way my parents treated me made me feel like absolute hell but the main issue was that my parents friends and my teachers always told me I had great parents which caused a sort of confusion in me. Everyone including my parents telling me my parents were amazing yet somehow I was the only one who felt they were horrible because my parents, SPECIFICALLY, my mother would act in one way when others were around and act completely different around others. That's why people thought my parents were good. Because they acted good around others and they had financial means to make it seem like my life was great. I can't really explain the whole shibang over reddit, at least right now. I am currently in therapy after 19 years of that life (20 years old now). I believe the best thing I can do for myself now is to move out of my mothers house and live with my Dad. I believe my Mom is a narcissist because EVERYTHING I read online about people being raised by narcissists fits my mom and my experience down to the T. 100%. My dad may have been mean and absent most of my life but he's nothing like my Mom. It's so weird how I can feel like my Mom isn't a narcissist at times but at the same time EVERYTHING about her and my experiences matches narcissism. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PERCENT. I'm sorry if this post seems very scattered and random I'm kinda in a mental mess right now. I just hate that I have to leave this house because my dogs live here and my dogs were the only things I was ever able to bond with in my family but I feel like I need to leave because it seems like it's one of the first steps I need to take. I just hope whatever I've said right now makes sense and that others understand I'm just going through so much shit right now. \n",

I don't have any experience with prescription amphetamines besides a small dose of concerta, but for those who have experience with both prescription amphetamines and propylhexedrine, how does propylhexedrine compare to the amphetamines. I'm on it right now and it always makes me feel amazing. Powerful ass euphoria, tingling, talkativeness, slight increase in focus, and a general contentedness with the world. I don't get the bad comedown some speak of, however I do notice deliriant like hallucinations when I've come down which is really odd and it does cause urinary retention which can be annoying as shit.

I may be one of the odd ones, but I almost kind of like depersonalization. I've always been a deep thinker, but this can come with a price when you're very insecure and sensitive. The world can really hurt you ya know? And DP/DR allows there to be this constant filter which everything passes through so it's like I'm not able to physically give a shit about stuff while depersonalized. I kind of like experiencing life from a distance. I'm able to have a better grasp (or at least I believe I do) on how people operate and can view issues from an objective point of view. Given the choice, I'd maybe choose to be cured but I'm mostly leaning towards no. I guess I'd have to see what life is like without it again. \n",

      "A big concern for a lot of people is automation, as in robots replacing jobs. I've been seeing a lot recently on this self driving truck and people worried about that inevitably replacing truck drivers. So companies are always trying to replace humans with robots as robots can work nearly 24/7, don't get bored, don't need to eat, don't require an hourly wage/salary, etc. I guess my question is what will the future be like if all needed labor were autonomous? It seems illogical to me because if we replaced all jobs with robots, then people can't work right, besides engineers coming up with new technology and having people work maintenance on the machines, so if a majority of the population can't work, then what? A company's goal is to maximize profit right? But if no one has any means of making money, then aren't companies going to inevitably lose money in the long term because they have no customers? And I can't see us eradicating money altogether because the richest of the rich would most definitely like to stay there, so this whole automation thing seems completely illogical. Or maybe this isn't really going to happen? Idk, please share any insight if you have any.\n",

The way I see it, a professional driver who both loves his job and does it well should be well more than capable of scheduling his own time when it comes to driving and sleeping. That individual knows their own sleep patterns, eating patterns, etc. and I don't see how they wouldn't be able to deliver a load on time if they were allowed to do this on their own. Like, after x amount of hours of driving, they tell dispatch, \"hey I'm gonna go to sleep now.\" 8 hours later, they feel refreshed and get right back to it. Why is it not this way? Or do some companies allow this and others don't? Are their laws regarding this issue I'm unaware of? \n",

Yesterday was my first time taking it and took 1 and 1/4 inhaler to test the waters, then two hours later took the rest of the 3/4 inhaler i had left. This stuff has ridiculous euphoria and I felt this general sense that everything was good about life. It wasn't until the comedown that things started to get strange. Everything started to take on this weird nostalgic like vibe, but a terrifying nostalgia like vibe. Like some sense of overwhelming fear I know I've felt way long ago but just wasn't able to pinpoint the memory (which has happened to me on deliriants). I didn't necessarily feel much fear, but it had a terrifying vibe. Then I started noticing visual hallucinations that were EXACTLY like diphenhydramine hallucinations. I'd see insects quickly sprint across my visual field. If I was in the dark, I would see strange blobs floating about, seeing strange shadow people in the distance, huge insects in the distance, etc. I've heard a lot of people say the comedown is harsh with this drug, but that's not really what I felt. I experienced strange vibes, deliriant visual hallucinations, and this overwhelming sense of physical anxiety I couldn't seem to shake off. Like I was unable to relax and my heart was just constantly palpitating. I'd start to relax a tad then a rush of adrenaline would swipe over me and it go back to palpitations.\n",

I'm talking like amphetamines or stimulants that are close to amphetamines like propylhexedrine. My theory is that although of course stimulants can exacerbate anxiety which can make DP worse, in general though, it tends to keep you focused on the present moment a lot more so your natural tendency to dissociate and begin to move elsewhere in the mind is greatly diminished, allowing for temporary relief. Maybe not full blown snapping out of DP/DR, but definitely noticeable relief. \n",

      "It really sucks how there's such a huge lack of understanding behind dissociative disorders. Many therapists/psychiatrists have absolutely no idea how to treat them because it's hard to understand what it's even like to have it unless you've experienced it yourself. I've dealt with chronic dp/dr for over 4 years now but have experienced lots of dissociative episodes since early childhood but would always come out of them. I was lucky to get a good therapist on my first try after being hospitalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The thing for me is that real life is scary and dissociation provides comfort for me. Every time I would begin divulging my feelings into the real world, I always would end up getting hurt. Just when I thought things would start getting good, I always got fucked by life. It's horrible. The more I talk to my therapist and think about my life, the more disturbing things I find in the back of my memory. So much stuff I didn't even realize I experienced because my life is so blurry and my memories seem very fake the farther I look back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing I can suggest to anyone is to get a therapist who has experience with treating and curing dissociative disorders. You may not get a good one on your first try, but the search will be worth it. You should not just simply wait for it to go away for many reasons. One, it might not go away if you don't seek any form of help. Two, plenty of people who have had it go away on it's own will sometimes eventually go back into dp/dr because they never treated the root cause of their problems. All dissociative disorders are caused by some sort of psychological trauma and you must heal from that trauma to truly get better. This is not something you can simply snap out of overnight. It will take time. A good way my therapist put it is yeah, when you come out, you might easily go right back but each time you come out, you might stay out for a lot longer. Maybe the first time you'll come out for a few minutes, the next time a few hours, then a day, then a few days, then a week, then a few weeks, then a month, then a few months, etc etc. Dissociative disorders are among the most difficult of all mental health issues to treat because of the complexities of how trauma/stress effect the brain. \n",

I've dealt with Depersonalization Disorder nearly my whole life due to a severely traumatic childhood and I am trying to get better everyday and I have seen some progress. Don't be afraid to ask anyone for help. Your parents. A teacher. A friend. Anyone. I left my issues untreated and unnoticed for 19 years of my life because I felt like the world was out to get me and that I couldn't trust anyone with anything. I now realize this isn't how I should have gone about this and I want everyone to know that you should not do this either. You're not alone in this.

Like I've got so much pent up negative emotions towards people and the world that I lash out at them because I feel as though they hurt me. Of course I wasn't hurt by every single human being, but it's caused me to stereotype people as being inherently bad and that they're scum who deserve no respect. I find it really bad because when you're dissociated, you view almost everything from an unbiased, objective point of view so that when I do actually feel anger, I can literally hyper analyze people and verbally rip them a new one while I don't feel hurt by anything they say. Almost like some arrogant invincibility. And I think because I only feel anger, it's become my dominant emotion and guidance for things in life so it's caused me to live life through some strange narcissistic ego.

Also sounds like the one you're talking about isn't a psychiatrist but a regular physician (cuz idk how he doesn't know what moclobemide is). But regardless, it's extremely dangerous to take any MAOI, even if it's a selective and reversible one, with any drug that has SRI properties. Ken Gillman has specifically adressed this combination as having a huge potential for fatal serotonin syndrome.\n",

The likelihood of them bothering to do anything about it is pretty slim. Walmart seems to really let most thefts slide. IDK if it's that most Walmarts have bad Loss Prevention or if they straight up don't care, but it's definitely pretty rare that a Walmart will ever bother doing anything about a theft unless you're shoplifting the same stuff over and over from the exact same store. Even then, they will most likely never press charges and will just give you a verbal warning to not come back. But again, they'll forget who you are after like 2 weeks anyway.

It's insanely expensive, you have to smoke it every 5 minutes to maintain the high, and the only thing you do while high on crack is do more crack, or figure out ways to get more money to buy more crack. Oh, and loading up paint chips you find on the floor into your pipe and smoking it, but you swear this next paint chip you found on the floor is crack this time and not another paint chip. Also, feeling the need to be overly aware of every tiny sound in and outside your house just in case someone decides to drop by despite the fact you live alone and no one is coming over to your house to judge you for smoking crack.\n",

      "Whippets are probably one of my favorite drugs of all time. It's a total addict drug and is called \"hippy crack\" for a reason. It's a short, but intense high and makes you compulsively redose the drug to sustain the desired level of intoxication. I've suffered from serious Depression since age 7 so I've always been drawn to all dissociative drugs such as ketamine, DXM, Nitrous etc for their antidepressant effect. Back in the peak of my using days, I would easily go through hundreds of those whippets in 10 hours. The problem is whippets are real expensive, especially the way that I use them. Hopefully this time I can fully abstain and not touch the stuff anymore. It makes me totally manic and drains the fuck out of my bank account.\n",

      "Just in terms of harm reduction, I'd say no. However, my honest answer is you'd probably be fine honestly. 10mg of Prozac is such a low dose to begin with and you've only been on it for a week when it takes up to 4 weeks for full therapeutic benefits. The biggest immediate risk is with CYP2D6 inhibition since both are broken down by that, but the doses of both are so low I really don't see a problem. The SSRI + DXM danger is really over inflated by a lot of people. The biggest no no for DXM is with MAOI's, not SSRI's because MAOI's make your body unable to break down serotonin. SSRI's don't work that way and while it's advised not to combine them, especially in high doses, I have spoken to multiple doctors and they say the risk of serotonin syndrome with DXM and SSRI's isn't very likely. Most seemed perplexed when I brought it up. Even looking at case studies involving Serotonin Syndrome from DXM and SSRI's, the cases involved ridiculously high dosages of DXM in the form of Triple C's (which includes Chlorpheniramine Maleate). Not in anyway saying it's safe to combine them for anyone reading, but I am just stating facts so people can make an informed decision.\n",

My social anxiety went away when I became chronically DP'ed and I know it played a big role in the development in my DPDR .. my social anxiety stemming from a fear of being too close to people, most likely due to growing up in a chaotic/dysfunctional home. When my DPDR alleviates itself, I find myself feeling those feelings I hated before chronic DPDR and it makes sense that DPDR is a way to escape that feeling. I feel like I can't truly open up to anyone without creating some barrier between myself and my emotions. Like the feelings are too intense for me to handle and I dissociate to get through it. It's a catch 22 because I'm able to converse with people without fear but I'm also unable to enjoy doing it. It sucks. \n",

I used to take 50mg DPH every time I did DXM but I figured out that the DPH was what was causing the very annoying hallucinations. DXM in and of itself really doesn't cause auditory hallucinations. And yes, 25mg of DPH with 600mg DXM is enough for it to alter the effects of the trip. They are not lying about how much these two drugs potentiate each other. It's not the visuals that bother me .. it's the auditory hallucinations. Almost all the voices I would hear outside my door are of people who live in my house and they're normally having conversations about me or are calling my name and it's really annoying because they're so vivid and detailed that I'll keep opening my door to find out no one is there. The knocking on the door is especially annoying because I'll hear it then be like \" ..what .. what? .. YO\" and then open the door and no one is there and all the lights are off. It's just so hard to ignore the voices when they're of people you know and the content of their conversation isn't mumbled nonsense, it sounds totally real and just bothers me the whole trip. \n",

I'll be in my room and I keep hearing people talking outside my room (such as my roommate or parents or whoever) who aren't there and I'll answer the door because I'm hearing these in depth conversations just to find out no one is there. Then I close the door and they start chatting again. I'll also hear knocks on the door as well or hear people trying to break down my door. If I take higher than 25mg DPH with DXM then I get annoying OEV's with it sometimes where the voices and visuals coincide.

      "Based on Tramadol's half life, there's no reason it would be dangerous to take DXM after 3 days of abstaining. It really only takes ~40 hours to be fully eliminated from your system when you take it at the doses he's taking and for the time period he's been taking it. Gabapentin has a similar half life so it should be fully eliminated around the same time the Tramadol is. The biggest risk is that both DXM and Tramadol combined have a risk of causing serotonin syndrome, but this would only occur if they're taken together in higher dosages, not from abstaining for 3 days. Gabapentin, although not saying you should combine them, is very unlikely to cause any real concerns when mixed with a small dose of DXM Polistirex. High doses of both could cause complications, but you'd really have to try to die. \n",

      "That's actually one of the biggest issues with childhood trauma is that most people who experienced that don't recognize they've been traumatized. Most of that has to do with the fact most traumas incurred during childhood are with the child to caregiver and growing up as a child, you don't recognize what you're experiencing/experienced is abnormal in anyway. You think it's 100% normal. Also, just by the nature of how trauma effects the brain, especially in children, the trauma is pushed very far below your conscious awareness as a means of coping with the overwhelming feelings of the trauma. Another thing is that typically with childhood trauma, it's not one single event. It's more often than not recurring traumas and they compound and reinforce the negative effects of each other, also known as Complex-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (aka Developmental Trauma). You begin to get used to the stress and eventually start to tune out (called dissociation). This is why they say dissociative disorders in general are caused by childhood trauma because children are the ones prone to doing it since they don't have as grounded of a sense of self as an adult and so they find it much easier to detach from themselves and their environment. It's seen as adaptive in childhood because it helps the child cope with what they are currently experiencing. The issue is when the child grows up and automatically dissociates (DPDR) without assessing whether or not their current situation is dangerous. You become stuck and your mind assumes every situation is dangerous or that you don't know when danger will come so that shield that helped you as a child becomes a maladaptive state as an adult. After reading all this, you can then see how those recovery steps make sense because it's a process of breaking down the shield and then dealing with the experiences that created the shield in the first place. \n",

Drug addiction isn't a black and white issue and I think AA/NA are for specific types of addicts, but a lot of addicts don't fall under that umbrella. I got annoyed with the whole program because I lived in a halfway house for a little under 2 months and was forced to go and everyone in the house and in the program trying to get sober would say over and over that AA/NA is the ONLY way to get clean and that if you don't get a sponsor and do steps you WILL get high which is just a load of BS. Plenty of people get sober without the program. Also, the program completely rejects science because it has and always will be exactly the same despite any advances in science on better treatments or any alternative treatments for addiction. 5% success rate with the program isn't anything to brag about if the program is always going to stay the same and if anything, it's going to get lower if and when better treatment options come out. If my car only started 5% of the time and someone told me I just need to put my faith in a higher power and \"it works if you work it\", I'd laugh and call you crazy because I'm going to take it to a mechanic who actually knows what to do.

      "It's really up to you. I've suffered from it since early childhood but have recovered from it. I never found that drugs ever made it worse, but it's up to the individual. I think why you see most stories online saying it was triggered by weed is that the person had a dramatic shift after the panic attack and so it was a night and day thing that they couldn't possibly not notice and freaked them out. The disorder is caused largely by childhood trauma (normally in the context of dysfunctional home lives) and other forms of long term stress like anxiety (which is most likely caused from adverse childhood experiences). Recovery can take a bit depending on the severity and the underlying causes of it. A lot of people who both study and treat DPDR refuse to acknowledge DPDR as its own standalone disorder, rather it is a manifestation of the above underlying causes (trauma, anxiety, etc) because after all, DPDR is a defense mechanism. It's purely psychological. Recovery involves learning to manage and soothe yourself from anxiety/stress which that alone typically makes the DPDR go away. Then comes treating what caused the anxiety/stress because you can easily get overwhelmed with stress again and become depersonalized again. This part can take a bit longer because it involves digging into your past and coming to terms with adverse, negative experiences, realizing how they effected you, and being honest with how they effected you and the things you experienced so that you can properly process them and heal from them. Honesty was one of the hardest things for me because my natural inclination was to deny and push everything away because I didn't want to be honest with anyone, including myself, how things actually effected me. Like I was embarrassed of what I went through. \n",

Nitrous Oxide can cause irreversible nerve damage from excessive, long term use due to vitamin B12 depletion. Some people say to take B vitamin supplements to help counteract that but I seriously question whether or not it actually helps whatsoever. Excessive nitrous use seriously depletes vitamin b12 so idk if taking a supplement would really do anything. Those cases of nerve damage with nitrous are very rare due to nitrous not being a typical drug that people abuse excessively and how costly it would be to do that with just whippets. You can get those 50lb tanks of them and get them refilled as much as possible but is sometimes tricky to get depending on where you live and where you try getting one. Also, with the nerve damage thing, Steve-O abused the fucking living shit out of Nitrous Oxide and even HE doesn't have nerve damage from it which goes to show how serious the abuse would have to be to get nerve damage from it. I think you'd also have to seriously ignore anything happening to your body because I'm pretty sure even the acquired neuropathy from nitrous doesn't just randomly happen over night and that you'll definitely start noticing issues before it progresses to being really serious. \n",

It took me a while to not only understand what was keeping me dissociated, but how to get better and move on from the pain in my past. Sometimes I thought I was better off staying depersonalized but I couldn't have been more wrong. The shield only provided some level of comfort, but staying numb is not any way to continue living and I decided I really needed to make the effort to get better. \n",

      "What have you tried doing as far as treatment goes? You've probably tried a bunch of things right? Me too. Not everything works for everyone. There's just as many treatment options that you haven't tried as however many you have tried. Maybe try getting a counselor not specifically for DPDR, but to have him teach you how to relax. Breathing is very important when it comes to stress and learning how to control your breath can do wicked things for helping you relax and deal with stress. It's not an overnight process. Overtime, you will start to break those barriers down and one day .. the shield will come off. Even if for just a few moments, but it will remind you of how beautiful life can be and that the effort of being able to stay out will be worth it. \n",

      "DPDR is a defense mechanism, so some type of stress or multiple different stressors would be the cause. I've found plenty of people in this sub who had theirs triggered by pot forgot about issues in their life before the development of the disorder. It makes sense. You haven't found a means of coping with it and moving on from it so it's pushed very far out of your day to day conscious awareness. For me, the big thing like I said in my post was social anxiety and I believe the social anxiety was caused by my home life because my parents made me feel shut off and not able to be vulnerable so naturally I felt that way with other people as well. \n",

      "I have a hard time believing that a panic attack while high could be the SOLE cause with nothing else at play, but for a second, I will assume that it is for some people. I will say that if this is the case for some, that this population would be a fraction of a percent of those with DPDR and recovery from that would probably be quicker than most others as long as you abstain from substance use. Lets say it is caused by it for that fractional percent of people. I could assume that since DPDR is a defense mechanism, the panic attack you experienced was extremely frightening and the drug amplified that feeling and so maybe in a way kind of traumatized you. Then after it wore off, your brain assumed that panic attacks were around the corner so that shield of DPDR remained so you wouldn't be overwhelmed with worrying if and when you'd have another panic attack. \n",

      "Edit: Another thing to point out is that there is no genetic precursor to dissociation because technically, everyone is capable of dissociating. There are certain things that may make you more likely to experience it like being naturally sensitive so stress is harder and more overwhelming for you, but there is no genetic precursor for this disorder. It's completely psychological. \n",

I think it is without a doubt that the people who get hooked on this either don't know the risks or they're suicidal and don't care.

      "What makes the high so alluring for that 2nd category is, in a tl;dr phrase that I saw on a comment on another post, \"body numb, mind euphoric.\" Air duster takes away all cares and worries and makes me content and happy, but that's only if I keep doing it and know that I have more left. Any and all tension in your body and mind just disappears. You might feel anxious and/or stressed out about whatever and you take a hit of it and BOOM, instant relief. No worries. It's not similar to how other drugs make you feel that way. It's very unique in that aspect and is something I've never found any other drug in existence to come close to having. You'll just put music on, huff duster, and just sit there and stare into space and you're totally happy with that. You never do anything on duster. You can't watch movies because you'll just black out. No motivation to do anything really besides huff duster and just think about how awesome you feel. It's very fiendish because of that. The bad part is the more you do, the worse the comedown and the comedown is NEVER not horrible and the only thing you think is how much you regret it and also think about how you wish you had more.

      "It sounds kinda shitty to say for people who've just recently started dealing with chronic DPDR, but getting used to it definitely helps a lot with recovery. The more you fixate on it, the more it's gonna bother you and not go away. I wondered the same thing too why it wouldn't go away and that's when I started really taking seriously the whole relaxation aspect. Try meditating and see if you can truthfully, fully relax. I found I couldn't do it. I could get REALLLLY close, but no cigar. I would get really close but then my mind would be like NOPE and my eyes would unfocus again. I find a lot of it was being afraid of fear itself if that makes sense. I'm so afraid of those bad feelings that I constantly had a shield up to protect myself from feeling those feelings. The big this is coupling relaxation practices everyday and also allowing any feelings to flow through you instead of allowing yourself to block them out whether you're doing it consciously or subconsciously or some combination. It takes a long time but once you first start to get the hang of it, your brain starts to click more and more on how to stay out and not dissociate because you realize what it is that you're doing wrong that's making you dissociate. \n",

My house manager goes into the guys room and finds a vodka bottle and then pours it out down the sink. For some reason, the dude who got drunk just fucking snapped when the manager dumped his vodka out and he started cussing out everyone and trying to fight everyone. He then proceeds to punch and completely break a glass door which ended up breaking his hand and cutting it up really bad. He then purposefully started spreading his blood all over the kitchen to where it looked like a fucking murder scene. He then went out and smoked a cigarette and started burning his cut hand with a lighter for whatever fucking reason. Then he tried punching one of the guys in the face and was tackled to the ground and was held there till the cops showed up.

The one guy who owned the halfway house I was at owned like a whole fuckton through the whole area so it didn't matter if you got kicked out of one house, he just moves you to another. He also took advantage of people on disability like people who had severe mental handicaps who SHOULD have been in an assisted living home, but instead just gladly took the states money and would never kick them out DESPITE if they got high because he KNEW they had guaranteed rent money coming from his disability. Like this one guy had SERIOUS permanent brain damage from a really bad car accident and had no idea what was going on EVER. No short term memory. Clearly couldn't think at all. He also got epilepsy from the car accident and has serious seizures and had to be on high doses of like 5 different medications that he forgot to take all the time and he'd have seizures if he missed one dose. He also got caught getting drunk or taking all his gabapentin pills and shit and he's immune to any punishment (I obviously get he doesn't know what he's doing) since the guy running these places knows he's gonna get that guaranteed rent money every week.

      "I think it's common knowledge in this sub that you can potentially pass a drug test by diluting your urine. Highly doubt drinking apple cider vinegar actually does anything. Drinking tons of water and combined with caffeine is just gonna make you piss almost straight water so the concentration of the drug metabolites will be below the threshold for failing the drug test. Most companies will however make you retest if you dilute your urine because a lab test can tell that your urine is diluted. Anyone attempting to do this, don't drink excessive amounts of liquid like this for any period longer than staying up all night for your drug test. You can end up in the hospital if you do this for a longer period of time because it will cause serious electrolyte imbalances.\n",

      "It totally depends what drugs we're talking about and why you're taking them. Not everyone feels like an emotionless zombie taking pharmaceuticals. I think in most cases, they're overprescribed but there are clearly people out there who need them. I've been to the psyche ward several times and I've met people who seriously cannot function whatsoever without medication and I also know people in real life who should be taking medication and refuse and they're an absolute mess. I met someone in the psyche ward, I'll call him M, who had SEVERE bipolar disorder. And I mean SEVERE. One of the issues with disorders like Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia is that a pretty big portion of those people either don't recognize they have a mental illness or they don't take it seriously whatsoever and therefore don't understand how their mental illness seriously effects themselves and those around them. For example, M LOVEEEDD to talk about how he has this whole thing under control and that it's a load of BS that he needs medication and that everyone else is crazy while at the same time telling you how this is his 11th time being hospitalized for his bipolar disorder because he has SERIOUS manic episodes and becomes extremely psychotic. And it's not like he's voluntarily coming in. He's having the police called on him and they have to forcibly take him because he doesn't recognize whatsoever how his behavior is so out of wack. He can say he doesn't need meds all he wants to, but if that's his 11th time being hospitalized .. there's clearly something he's not doing right and I know for a fact he's going to most likely be hospitalized 11 more times in his life. He ends up there frequently and he's in his mid 20's. \n",

      "Another person is my friends older brother. Severe schizophrenia and doesn't believe at all he's schizophrenic and therefore doesn't take meds. It's so bad that his parents couldn't allow him to live with them anymore because he would stay up all night screaming at voices and people that weren't there and also did drugs like crack and meth on top of having schizophrenia. Most people I know with schizophrenia who know they're mentally ill will say, \"sure, the meds suck sometimes but I recognize that I cannot function whatsoever without them.\" It's pretty wicked how psychosis can effect someone that much where I won't even be able to recognize they're the same person. \n",

      "SSRI's are more beneficial for severe depression, not so much mild to moderate. You would probably benefit a lot from getting a counselor to help you treat your anxiety without the use of medication. Do you feel you suffer from some level of social anxiety? Plenty of people do and there's plenty of help out there if you're willing to make the effort to get better and live the life you want to live. If you find that abstinence from porn heightens your self esteem and social assertiveness, then you should take all that positive energy and combine that with some counseling with a therapist who can help you to feel more comfortable in social situations. You might find that just simple exposure therapy can help you overcome it altogether. The abstinence from porn puts you at a higher baseline to approach the fear and then exposing yourself to your fear helps you to see there was nothing to be afraid of after all. It's easier said than done but you can either continue to hide from life and just bury yourself into the world of instant gratification like porn and drugs, or kick life straight in the nuts and not let it scare you from being the person you want to be. \n",

The path you're heading down seems like it's going to inevitably cause some serious damage to your brain and body. Aside from the fact that your MDMA use seems pretty excessive and that you're most likely going to regret using it so much if you continue to use it, supplementing that with cocaine is just going to cause further issues. I think you need to take a step back and think hard about why you think any of this sounds like a good idea because everything I read sounds like you're heading down a very slippery slope.

In general I wouldn't recommend taking any drug to alleviate hypersexuality. If you see it as being a problem, then you should abstain from watching porn and go out and find a partner. Not sure how old OP is but I wouldn't say it's really that abnormal for a young man to have a high sex drive. You just need to focus that energy onto a real human being instead of wasting all the energy on porn. Abstaining from porn is going to naturally increase your motivation to seek out a partner. \n",

      "I didn't fully recover until age 21 and I've had it since childhood. I grew up in a very psychologically unhealthy home and my parents traumatized me severely. It took me a long time to recover but YES it is possible. You need to realize DPDR is a feeling like all other feelings and that once you find what it is that the DPDR is protecting you from, you can move on from this and recover. Don't let this discourage you. You need to understand that you are a very strong person and that you've gone through some shit and the DPDR is protecting you from overwhelmingly bad feelings from your past. It's a defense mechanism that when we first developed it, it was considered adaptive because it helped you through a stressful time in your life. The problem is when we continue to dissociate 24/7 when the original danger is no longer present and our mind has become conditioned to assume that danger is everywhere without assessing the current situation to see that you are in fact safe right now. It took me a long time to come to terms with what the DPDR was protecting me from, but once I came to terms with all that and realized that I am safe and in a better place, I overcame it and I no longer use dissociation as a defense mechanism because the original causes of this disorder for me are in the past and not the present and I now know how to properly deal with stress that I face in the present moment. \n",

      "Are you talking strictly on therapeutic doses of prescription amphetamines? Maybe. It's a hit or miss with stuff like that for anxiety. If you've ever taken adderall recreationally or some other amphetamine, you probably noticed you felt less socially anxious. In terms of using therapeutic doses of them regularly to help with it, I'm not sure how effective it would be. I know you talked about not wanting to take SSRI's but I know Lexapro is very effective in treating social anxiety and I personally have taken it and compared to drugs like benzos or amphetamines which have immediate effects, SSRI's take a few weeks to kick in full gear but I definitely noticed a difference and then just cold turkey stopped taking it after 6 months because it allowed myself to expose myself to my fear and see that all along .. there was nothing to be afraid of. Social anxiety is more so something I dealt with many years ago .. my main issue is dealing with a dissociative disorder which I don't want to get into. Personally .. I would recommend trying to find a therapist who helps people with that disorder so you can not just overcome it, but understand why you felt that way so you don't have to deal with it again. That's just my 2 cents. Meth and cocaine are both stimulants that make people more social but the comedown makes you feel like shit and adderall is a stimulant as well .. I really don't buy adderall in therapeutic doses helping people with social anxiety long term.\n",

Difference with that and those prone to addiction is that once out of college, your buddies go on to get jobs and start a family and a few people just never stop drinking. I drink everyday too. It's hard to stop. I remember when some cheap 40 oz would get me fucked up .. now I can easily down a 12 pack like it's nothing and still drink more. Those 3 - 6 shots can escalate to 5 - 8, then 8 - 12 .. etc. Not to sound like some middle school health teacher, but I'm just saying be careful.

With crack .. when smoked .. hits instantly. You feel it as you're taking a drag off of your pipe. Hold it in. Exhale. Immediate pleasure. Big adrenaline rush followed by massive euphoria. Only problem is .. every hit .. you get diminishing returns. You chase that first hit. Realistically, you'll get 3 - 4 good blasts and everything after that is chasing that without the magic of the 1st hit. The bell ringer. The following hits then have less euphoria and more anxiety/paranoia. But you keep doing it till you're out. You'll swear after it's your last time .. nah.

I'll sit in a chair and there's a feeling like aw yes, feels good to sit and there's energy radiating from sitting in the chair and I feel like I can breathe. I feel like because I'm already dissociated, the drug can't make me feel more dissociated and actually seems to reverse the dissociation I feel naturally. Like I'm dissociating from dissociation, therefore making me feel associated. Grounded. Whatever. Not to say my experience with these substances will be like others with DPDR, but this is what I personally experience. \n",

Adding a 2mg bar to that would almost guarantee death if the person is unsupervised by anyone. 50mg of oxy is definitely not a low dose. That's a low dose for someone with a tolerance. My only advice is if the dose you took wasn't that high for you personally and you are no longer high, then you're gonna be fine. Mixing benzos while high on opiods is not safe. People do it, but most people doing that are opiod/opiate addicts and even then, sometimes people die.

      "I've tried researching brain zaps for a bit in the past and can hardly find any information on what they are besides a description of what it feels like. I've experienced brain zaps for many reasons like excessive dissociative drug abuse (DXM, Deschloroketamine, etc) and from excessive alcohol abuse (I think slight withdrawal). These zaps, like others have mentioned, can occur not just from SSRI withdrawal, but alcohol and benzo withdrawal as well. I assume it's your CNS being overly stimulated from it being repressed. SSRI's also alleviate anxiety but its main action deals with serotonin as opposed to substances like alcohol or benzos which deal primarily with GABA and the extent to how much benzos and alcohol depress your CNS is significantly greater so when W/D'ing from them overstimulates your CNS to a seriously dangerous extent depending on the level of use and for how long. \n",

Hydro is of course a lot weaker than oxy. 20mg would probably be a good starting dose. 30mg would be pushing it because since hydro is weaker, you have to take a higher dose to reach similar effects that oxy gives you and these higher doses will give you more negative effects to reach those comparable effects of oxy.

They do it for recreation to have a good time. Just like you said about a very small percentage of people who smoke weed go on to develop DPDR, a very small percentage of people who smoke weed go on to abuse it all day everyday to cope with life. If the average person smoking weed did it to block out emotions, that would be the most boring and pointless thing to do and you can clearly see that when someone is high, they're having fun.

      "100% man. Stuff like this makes me borderline tear up. I feel the same fucking way. I seriously think we're all very sensitive people and the way we subjectively experienced life, it didn't go good. In fact, it went totally south. I feel the same way. I feel I'm either detached or I'm overly sensitive. There's nothing wrong with being sensitive. In fact, if things overall go good, it provides way more meaning to life than the average person. But when things go bad, we have the potential to end up like this. That's just my view. Seriously man. The thing about dogs man. I have two and I no longer live with my parents and my two dogs live with my mother. I visit my mother on a weekly basis despite that I don't like her, I miss my dogs .. and dogs.. love you no matter how weird or whatever the fuck you are. You show them love, and they show you love in a way that is so unbiased and in a way that you never thought possible. My oldest dog is experiencing health problems and I've cried many times while drinking because of it and I seriously can't stand the fact of losing him within the next few years. It breaks my fucking heart man. \n",

      "You're in the right place man. This subreddit compared to most other sites on the internet (not bashing them), clearly has very intelligent and open minded people with experience of what you've gone through. I don't know you. I don't know what you've been through. I don't know how long you've been dealing with this. I myself have been through all the stages of severe DPDR as I have dealt with it on and off since early childhood and have dealt with it chronically for 5 years (the 24/7 version). I and many others in here will attest to the fact it DOES get better. Your symptoms will improve. Again, I don't know how long you've been dealing with this but it sounds like you might be in the early stages of the severe part of it. I've been there too man. It sucks. BUT. I have recovered a whole fuck ton man. I've even had moments where I came out of it, my longest lasting period of that was a month. It's fucking rough. It's hard. But, in the end, you will look back and think it was worth it. Why? WHY? That sounds retarded right? Because this shit LITERALLY sucks the life out of you. BUT. When you recover. YOU WILL RECOVER. You will have a serious appreciation of life that the average person would take for granted and be a more motivated, passionate, and loving human being. I know right now it's shitty. But you will strive. You've got so many years of life ahead of you man. Just take it one day at a time. \n",

      "It's so weird and hard to describe .. I've recovered a whole fuck of a lot. I mainly just deal with slight emotional numbing, not feeling fully present, feeling like there's some slight immaterial layer over my eyes preventing me from feeling \"there\". But it doesn't really effect me much nor do I really fixate on it. If I'm with friends, I usually just forget about it and can overall have a good time. But it's so weird because with that level of derealization, I don't have a layer over my eyes. I do in some weird way actually feel WAY TOO PRESENT. It feels like I'm being shoved too much into the present moment but for whatever reason, the present moment feels TOO INTENSE. It's TOO REAL. I literally could not stand the intensity of it all. That episode didn't last long. Once my panic attack died down, I went right back to how I normally was and told my buddies about what just happened and we all just laughed it off. But god damn. Sometimes I question whether that was actually derealization or maybe life is just too intense for me and that's why I still maintain some level of dissociation. I'm of course inclined not to believe that but it was just so weird feeling present but life just felt way too overwhelming. Like I said in the post, I literally thought to myself, \"Is life really like this? Is this what life looks like to everyone else but I'm just not able to accept the life I've been given?\" I of course am still inclined to not agree but it was overall a super strange experience. \n",

      "My DPDR started way long ago in childhood but developed chronically about 5 years ago. Almost all my drug experiences have been positive. About as close to 100% as you can get. I've had nothing but great experiences with mushrooms, LSD, and MDMA. Not everyone will experience that. Not sure how long ago you took it, but normally your first trip with a substance like LSD or MDMA will have this positive, perceptual change afterglow. It won't last forever. The first time I did shrooms, I thought all my lifes problems would be gone forever. It did last for a bit, but reality came back. I think that at the very least, you should try writing how you currently feel and felt and note the differences between your DPDR state. Chemically, the drug stopped working as soon as the actual high wore off. Having that positive perceptual change beyond the experience is normal for drugs like MDMA. Just understand that this won't last forever. That's why I recommend writing down how you currently feel and how you felt during the experience so later down the road when you go back to DPDR, you can seek some form of help and bring this up to your therapist or even yourself. \n",

      "I've dabbled in recreational benzo abuse years ago. I know you're talking about using it as medically advised, but I do have experience nonetheless. Benzos undeniably help alleviate anxiety. How can they not? That's legit physically how they act on the body. That doesn't mean I ever felt like I felt more emotional, but I felt less tense. In a way, it's why I probably drink too much beer nowadays. I can get 8 beers worth for $5 and I normally only drink 6 per day. Doesn't mean it completely alleviates my DPDR, but it does help with the anxiety aspect and specifically with alcohol moreso than benzos, helps to allow some emotions to flow through. That doesn't mean what I'm doing is healthy in anyway or that benzos should ever be used on a regular basis regardless of whether you have DPDR or something else. But yeah, they undeniably help with alleviating anxiety. \n",

Weight does factor into how drugs effect you for most drugs. 17.5mg oxycodone at 135lbs for me... I had the time of my life. I tried Hydrocodone a few times at the same weight cuz I had left over from my wisdom tooth surgery and barely got anything besides effects you got. You clearly did get some effects like lowered social inhibitions. I got the same effects from hydro my times taking it but hydro .. even for a lightweight .. is weak shit. Oxycodone. Look. Just tell me your weight. For you, 10mg probably wouldn't do shit but it is clear you got effects from it. Even 10mg for myself at the time would probably yield the same results..

      "I don't know why your therapist would say DPDR is caused by your HPPD considering they're not related. HPPD is just ongoing visual distortions from hallucinogenic drug use like seeing walls breathe or seeing your carpet swirl around. Idk what your symptoms of HPPD you experience, I just know when you're depersonalized, the HPPD seems worse. A lot of people with DPDR talk of seeing visual snow (which by the way, everyone sees visual snow and visual snow in and of itself is not HPPD like some people might think). My thoughts with DPDR and visual snow is that because you're detached from your surroundings, you just notice it more because it's like the visual snow is detached from the surroundings instead of it blending in where it would otherwise not really be noticeable. \n",

      "And yeah, trauma is really subjective and isn't some black and white thing where you were beaten or sexually abused as a child. In terms of DPDR specifically, it's normally in the context of dysfunctional families where either one or both parents have psychological issues themselves which of course they translate their unhealthy behaviors onto their children. Also in the context of DPDR, researches find that people who develop this disorder are naturally introverted, introspective, and sensitive people which growing up in a chaotic or otherwise unhealthy family can takes its toll on a growing child. The trauma in dissociative disorders is normally what some refer to as C-PTSD which is trauma that a child experiences growing up but it's not one single event. It's a combination of things like living in a dysfunctional family where the child experiences stress from their parents which compounds and then that stress can carry through beyond just the home and into their school life and friends and how they relate to others. One big thing with DPDR is that they find people with the disorder have something known as a disorganized attachment style which is normally created from chaotic and otherwise dysfunctional families which can create some level of inner turmoil in a growing child which can effect how they relate and attach to other people. \n",

In terms of successfully treating something like depression or anxiety, combining both medication AND therapy will yield the best results. The meds will help bring you to a higher baseline so you are more open to suggestions and carrying out those suggestions from your therapist so you can then integrate them into your psyche. \n",

      "I've had bad derealization episodes a few times on pot, but I've suffered from Depersonalization Disorder since early childhood.

      "First and foremost, I do need to point out that a person cannot acquire a dissociative disorder SOLELY from drugs. Dissociation is a defense mechanism and is something (specifically talking in the context of dissociative disorders) you learn to do in childhood because children don't have as a grounded of a sense of self and are more easily able to detach themselves from themself and their environment. It's common for people not to remember any episodes they experienced in childhood just based on the fact of what dissociation is. It's a lack of connection between things that are normally associated with one another so when a child detaches from their sense of self/and or environment, those experiences are not properly integrated into the persons sense of self and therefore not properly integrated into their memory. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some people think \"why now?\" Why after doing this drug did I become fully depersonalized and not earlier? Well.. the human psyche is very strong and is capable of putting up with a lot of shit to say the least. You had all the prerequisites for developing the disorder but they way your life had been up until that moment, your mind was able to keep it at bay. THEN, for you, LSD comes in and triggers these bad feelings then have been stored for years and your mind doesn't know how to cope with these intense feelings of fear, so as a last of the line coping mechanism, your mind numbs out. We become dissociated because we lack the coping skills to soothe ourselves from these feelings. As people in our shoes, after doing some real digging into their past, they can see how there were many warning signs of a person just barely hanging on. Some worse than others, but there were warning signs nonetheless. \n",

We all want to recover and once we do, we want to share our recovery with everyone currently suffering and I think your video, like many others, or just your recovery story in general, provides hope to others who are currently suffering from the same disorder. I have done so much research on the disorder and I know mine personally is caused by serious childhood trauma. Maybe not serious in an OBJECTIVE sense like oh this person was raped or beaten bloody every night, but in a SUBJECTIVE sense. As in who I am just naturally and what I experienced. My PERSONAL opinion on the matter.. and anyone is free to disagree. I think this disorder is caused much more on a root cause than just oh I smoked weed or took X drug and got Y disorder (in this case DP/DR). I think, without a single fucking doubt, objectively analyzing EVERYONE with depersonalization, that everyone here without a fucking DOUBT is a very deep, intellectual, introspective, and sensitive person. Maybe for some people, drugs may have triggered a panic attack and a realization crisis. I will NEVER doubt that clearly some people with disorder may be \"purely\" drug induced and that abstinence from such substances and just getting on with life will have them get over it within not much time. Those who suffer from it longer? I seriously doubt a drug was the sole cause, nor do I believe anyone suffering from this develops it solely from drugs. We all clearly have very similar personalities here. DIFFERENT STORIES. But without a fucking doubt, similar personalities. I KNOW I personally SUBJECTIVELY experienced some shit, as a I believe most of us have. For those suffering for more than 12 months, I FUCKING ENCOURAGE you to seek mental health treatment. We're introspective and deep thinking. We might think medication or therapy won't help us. But what have you been doing thus far and how far has it gotten you in this serious journey? Nowhere (not trying to be a dick). I'm just pointing out, suffering from this is terrible as I know I have dealt with this on and off since early childhood and developed it chronically over 5+ years ago. HELP IS OUT THERE.

I have personally went through serious dissociative drug abuse in the past where I was dosing a minimum of 400mg - 500mg a day minimum of DXM HBr powder that I was buying online and on top of that, would also take a few hundred mg of Deschloroketamine on top of it. Dissos for me, were top dawg of all drugs. They have psychedelic aspects, but also don't have any aspects of straight psychs where I could freak out. Dissos are laid back psychedelics. I cud just sit on my computer everyday just taking DXM and snorting Deschloroketamine and be 100% fine and perfect with what's going on. That's not to say I've somehow perfectly evolved from my past .. I haven't. But I totally understand to some extent what you're going through man.

Your brain is always receiving input from the outside world so when it is deprived of certain sensory information, it makes things up which is why people who enter a room that is designed to completely isolate any and all sound, it legit makes people hear voices.

For example, with Schizophrenia, there are antipsychotics which treat the main symptoms of that disorder and can completely halt/seize psychotic symptoms.

Dissociation is something all humans are capable of and everyone does it to some extent such as simply zoning out while driving on a boring highway. To the extent that some experiences pathological dissociation (as in the case of a dissociative disorder, the most common being Depersonalization Disorder), it is caused from ones environment and can be more likely to occur by ones own genetic temperament (inborn emotional reactivity, such as being emotionally sensitive).\n",

Maybe you're not the kind of person who benefits from them. I believe with a lot of mental health issues aside from SERIOUS disorders like Bipolar or Schizophrenia, that meds and therapy combined help significantly and the meds help you be more open to suggestions give to you in therapy and make you more confident to acting out those suggestions and over time, you can stop taking meds. That's just my personal opinion but irregardless, I wish you luck in your journey. \n",

      "Although it's worth pointing out that if you bothered reading the sources, 2/3 only talked about very small doses of meth being beneficial for people who had just suffered a traumatic brain injury and none talked about using meth regularly. In fact, all three sources explicitly stated within the first two sentences that meth is neurotoxic when abused. To say that meth can be neuroprotective is only true in the very slightest technicality, but given that this is r/stim , I can 100% guarantee you not a single person in this subreddit would do meth at such a low dose a couple of times to have a \"neuroprotective\" effect. Also, the sources only have one scenario where it was proven to have somewhat of a neuroprotective effect on human beings and that was administering it within a certain time frame of getting a traumatic brain injury. The source not talking about it in that context is done on rats and while studies done on rats may warrant some thought on how it would apply to humans, a majority of studies (as in over 50%) results we find for rats are not applicable to humans.\n",

On top of doing that everyday, I would also mix it with other stuff like 4aco or Deschloroketamine.

Despite being on DXM, I'd still go through at least 500mg of Deschloroketamine in a night when I had some.

Happens mainly to sensitive people who are introverted, quiet, etc. Just judging from what you said, you said you felt awkward around people which already shows you've had issues beforehand because people don't become dissociated for no reason then randomly develop a phobia towards something. The phobia already existed and you may have had ways to cope with it before but cannabis can trigger dormant psychological issues (not just schizophrenia, but dormant issues like predisposition to dissociation which would be childhood issues) and the cannabis caused a full blown panic attack and the cannabis heightened your senses of that panic attack and your mind didn't know how to cope with the intensity of the fear so it's instinct was to detach. Dissociation is something you learn to do in early childhood and most people don't remember doing that because dissociated states aren't properly integrated into your long term memory. \n",

It might sound dumb to you, but take it from me as someone whose had to deal with this disorder most of their life, I would have benefited tremendously if I had gotten help sooner than later. It's tricky to treat them but just having someone you can talk to openly about things is really beneficial for people with DP/DR because it takes you out of your head and helps re attach your self back into the present moment. DP/DR is like a state of your mind trying to actively block everything out to protect you from psychological pain instead of accepting the natural flow of your feelings to just exist and let things be. \n",

      "This applies to legit all hormones. When you start supplementing hormones whether it be Melatonin or Testosterone, you're literally telling your body to stop producing it naturally because you have this outside source to do the work for you. Yes, Melatonin is produced when you are exposed to darkness to tell your body to start preparing for sleep, but when you supplement Melatonin, you're rewiring this effect and depending on how long and how much you do, that effect when being exposed to darkness is nullified a decent amount and you're reliant on an outside source to provide you with melatonin. That's just how taking hormones from an outside source works. It's obviously no where near the extent that taking growth hormones is, but this effect happens with melatonin which is why I bring up the fact of how there's no reason to take more than 0.3mg of melatonin and you shouldn't use it as a life long thing. It's more so something to help with jet lag so you can reset your bodies internal clock and something to help you with sleep issues in the short term. If you have serious sleep problems, always see a doctor about this and sure, maybe melatonin is what you consider to be your best bet as supplemental melatonin is cheap, OTC, and doesn't alter your sleep architecture nearly to the degree that prescription hypnotics do. But, I always try to sway people away from anything to help them fall asleep if they're not suffering from SERIOUS sleep issues. Sometimes lifestyle changes are enough to fix the issue. \n",

Also, when you smoke pot, do you think by chance you may be sitting in positions you would otherwise think is uncomfortable but because you're stoned you don't think they are and you're sitting in a position where you're cutting off blood flow which on top of anxiety is causing these symptoms? Also, if you're a person who doesn't smoke very much which seems to be the case for you, I know that pot can definitely make your blood pressure drop and that could potentially be causing these symptoms and what can most likely be happening is irregardless of what is causing this, the pot is making you hyper analyze and hyper fixate on what's happening and making it seem a lot worse than it actually is and you're causing some psychosomatic reaction.\n",

      "The thing with people rationalizing their DXM use as being safe because there isn't evidence to show otherwise is illogical. DXM abuse is ONE, not very widespread as compared to abuse of other dissociative drugs like Nitrous Oxide, Ketamine, and PCP, and TWO, DXM has not been around for very long, which on top of the fact abuse of it is not very widespread, means there is of course going to be a huge lack of evidence. It's the same thing as not having evidence on serious abuse of stuff like Diphenhydramine. There's legit no evidence because hardly anyone abuses the stuff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking this into account, there is no reason whatsoever to think DXM is \"safe\" or not bad for you, specifically when abused heavily. There is a difference between using ANY drug once or twice a month versus taking it 5+ times a week, especially at high dosages. The studies that talk about Olney's Lesions in the context of other dissociatives like Ketamine and PCP occur in the context of serious, long term abuse and not acute usage. There's really no reason to think that Olney's Lesions can't occur in heavy DXM abusers because the evidence just straight up doesn't exist. I'm not saying it does, but there is a huge lack of evidence regarding almost anything related to DXM abuse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to point out which should seem obvious is that DXM is extremely bad for your heart. Just take your blood pressure the day after a third plateau trip and holy fuck. You'll be tachychardic and hypertensive as fuck. I normally have decent blood pressure but the day after a DXM trip, it can easily be up to 140/90 and resting heart rate at 100+ BPM. Acute/moderate usage, your body can recover. Doing this everyday is going to put excessive strain on your heart and will no doubt cause some damage. \n",

      "Touching back on Olney's Lesions, Olney's Lesions are not even something that occurs in 100% of heavy dissociative users even those abusing Ketamine and PCP.

Which also adds to the fact that the evidence probably won't be here for a while because it occurs in a low population of users, not many people abuse DXM, and DXM is still a relatively new substance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing to bring up is that dissociative drugs in general can cause bladder problems in a somewhat low percentage of users and there have been plenty of people who've abused drugs such as Ketamine who now piss in a plastic bag because these drugs can wreak havoc on your bladder and there's no reason whatsoever to think DXM is immune to this. \n",

I guess my best bet is to find a roommate somehow or several where we can split the costs. I really prefer to live on my own which is why I asked this question if living solely on my own is possible with my current level of income. My best bet really is to hopefully get into the apprenticeship program because the second you get in, my wage instantly goes up a good bit to over $20 an hour. The apprenticeship program takes 5 years to fully complete and I'll be making over $50/hr when I complete the program and then if I decide to get my Journeyman's, I'll be making even more money. The only thing with the apprenticeship though is when you apply, you're not guaranteed to get in so it might take a few times of applying to get in, but being a union worker, I am at least guaranteed to make a raise every 6 months and that caps out after 8 raises and then the only way to make more is to get in the apprenticeship and then get my Journeyman's. \n",

I see no issue inhaling straight from the canister even though some people say otherwise. I've done it god damn I have no idea how many times as I've inhaled dozens upon dozens of whippets and I've never once felt like even directly after cracking the whippet into the canister that the nitrous was even remotely cold.

      "The effects of DXM last quite a bit of time and considering how huge of a dose you took with clearly little to no tolerance, it's no wonder you're experiencing these effects. You're fine, DXM does this when you take really high doses of it or take high doses multiple days in a row. Some of the effects you're experiencing just have to do with how serious of a potent serotonergic drug DXM is and dissociative drugs in and of themselves can cause urinary retention. I definitely get pretty strong urinary retention of high doses which is one of just the many reasons I don't like dosing into 4th plateau territory because it's clearly really bad for you both physically and mentally to do that and where you can start to experience a lot of negative effects from DXM on those dosages. \n",

Also, if you feel nauseous at any point, do not feed into it. Most people react to nausea by feeling anxious and hyper fixating on it which further aggrevates the nausea, inevitably resulting in vomiting. DXM isn't like alcohol where you've ingested too much and your body is trying to fight back by rejecting any more alcohol from entering your blood stream. It's mostly the shit that over the counter DXM is composed of (gels and syrup), especially when mixed with tons of food in your stomach, that irritates your stomach and your body reacts with nausea and vomiting. You just need to breathe, relax, and not feed into it. Almost everytime I do this, the nausea subsides.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. In my extensive experience with DXM and knowing plenty of others with lots of experience, most of the nausea comes from having food in your stomach. If you are buying DXM otc, I personally prefer taking gels. No taste and I find they are way less nauseating. Best thing for avoiding nausea beyond dosing on an empty stomach is swallowing the gels with a soothing beverage such as ginger ale, taking 50mg Diphenhydramine 30 - 60 minutes before dosing DXM, laying down for the entire come up (avoid moving around), and just relaxing. If you feel nauseous, don't feed into it. Just breathe and relax and the nausea normally subsides if you do this instead of getting anxious and hyper fixating on the nausea. Easier said than done but I've mastered this with my extensive DXM use.\n",

Now I've heard some shit on 420chan /dis/ boards about people claiming DXM potentiates itself and that taking more DXM somehow amplifies the effects even more than taking that same dose all at once, but I've never once found this to be true. Take it all at once. Most people swear by the plat per week rule. As in if you take a 1st plateau dose, you should wait 1 week before doing DXM again. So if you do a 3rd plateau dose, you should wait 3 weeks before dosing again. It's not scientific by any means, but it's a rule of thumb for avoiding tolerance. That's not to say you won't build a tolerance this way, but it will build significantly slower and probably take a long ass time to have a noticeably high tolerance. \n",

      "If you're mixing LSD and DXM, don't add DPH, it's just gonna kill whatever vibes the LSD adds to the experience. Also, you seriously need to be 100% fucking certain what you're taking is LSD because although we'd like to trust our dealers, they sometimes give you random RC's or they were sold random RC's and are unaware what they have isn't LSD. LSD and DXM can be taken together safely. Plenty of RC's that are sold as being LSD can easily cause serotonin syndrome when mixed with DXM and you most certainly do not want that to happen, especially in a forest at night time with other people tripping with you. I've never done this combo but I know people who have. Expect it to be very intense and depending on your dose, tolerance, and weight, probably also having your motor skills be pretty effected. \n",

      "The issue with Chlorpheniramine Maleate as opposed to Diphenhydramine is that CPM is AFAIK the most serotonergic 1st generation antihistamine and combining several drugs that effect serotonin, specifically combining them with DXM is dangerous as DXM is extremely serotonergic on its own. CPM also has a significantly longer half life than diphenhydramine. CPM having a 21 - 27 hour half life as opposed to Diphenhydramine having a 8.5±3.2 hour half life. Also, with CCC's, to get a high dose of DXM, you will be consuming a very large dose of CPM. 1st generation antihistamines are broken down by the CYP2D6 enzyme, which is the same as DXM, so this competition between being broken down by the same liver enzyme potentiates the effects of both drugs greatly. So taking all this into account, CPM being a lot more serotonergic than most other 1st gen antihistamines, having a significantly longer half life than most 1st gen antihistamines, the dose required to get a high dose of DXM, and the liver enzyme competition can cause serious complications when taken in high dosages. Almost all of the DXM deaths I have read about happened when several drugs were involved and not with DXM on its own, most notably DXM in combination with CPM and sometimes in combination with SSRI's or MAOI's. \n",

What's probably the enjoyable disso for most people (I'm gonna exclude Nitrous Oxide). I would say Ketamine. Why? Well, for starters, most people who do Ketamine snort it. Snorting K has a way lower bioavailability than IM'ing it and most people who are only going to use K like 5 times throughout their life aren't gonna be injecting a drug. Also, the Ketamine high is a lot shorter in duration compared to almost all other dissociatives excluding Nitrous Oxide.

      "Dissociative drugs compared to other classes of drugs tend to cause psychosis and/or psychotic symptoms more often than other classes of drugs. This applies to all dissociatives such as Ketamine, PCP, DXM, MXE etc etc. Dissociatives should not be something you abuse regularly\n",

Dissociatives are my favorite class of drug but they need to be used with care because I've seen plenty of people go totally overboard with it and seem totally psychotic after a bit.\n",

      "DXM causes a very strange tolerance in that when you abuse it regularly, the tolerance is near permanent and sometimes straight up permanent. I weigh around 135lbs to 140lbs and I can take like an 800mg dose and feel like I just took a sugar pill whereas a year ago that would put me on another planet. I've never lost the magic of dxm and I don't believe in the 50 trip limit. The \"magic\" is just a perspective thing and typically the \"magic\" goes away because most people who have tripped on DXM 50 plus times were at the point of using it more regularly and not moderately. I don't really believe you can abuse DXM forever because your tolerance will get to the point where you're completely immune to the effects and any dose that would make you trip would be a toxic dose of DXM and you'd risk death just to barely trip. \n",

From what I've read, both drugs are broken down by similar enzymes so this combination could cause potentiation of the effects of DXM. I'd say my main issue is that Abilify is an atypical antipsychotic so my guess is that you are using abilify for some mental illness that can cause psychosis and it's probably not a good idea to be taking a dissociative drug if you are prone to psychosis. Maybe you're taking abilify for depression as I know antipsychotics have been used in the treatment of depression (rarely do they prescribe them for depression) but I'd advise most people who are taking a drug for any mental illness to not combine their medication with DXM. \n",

Also, after dosing, eat a small snack. Nothing sweet. Eat something grainy and salty like pretzels or saltine crackers. This can also help soothe your stomach and soak up the DXM so it doesn't irritate your stomach as much.\n",

      "Most importantly, relax. When you start overthinking about getting nauseous, you're stressing yourself out.

The one thing about nutmeg compared to other deliriants is that nutmeg is one of the few deliriants that induces euphoria.

Although, tripping in the dark is what brings out the visuals of most drugs. I prefer to do it at night but that's me. \n",

It's not something you need x amount of said plateau trips under your belt. You just gotta be in the right setting and it'll be a great time. I'd always recommend a 3rd plateau dose if you have a whole day/night to yourself with no responsibilities.\n",

      "Edit: Trust me. You're totally fine. You had a bad a trip and you're worried but the fact you are so self aware shows you're not psychotic. You just got really high on a dissociative and were overwhelmed by it. I've taken extremely high doses of DXM which is a very powerful dissociative, at decent 4th plateau doses. It's like the k hole, but way crazier and more intense and lasts for upwards of 8 hours, followed by a 36hr+ afterglow. The effects of DXM on the 4th plateau for me were comparable to not remembering I took a drug, felt high for an eternity, astral projection, Near death experiences, being convinced I was never a human being and it was only at that moment that I had realized it .. like comparing myself to some entity beyond human consciousness, haha I can't remember everything but seriously, high doses of dissociatives, anything is possible haha like those drugs are WAYYY different than traditional psychedelics like mushrooms and LSD. I find more people enjoy traditional psychs over dissociatives because of how overwhelmingly powerful and weird the trip is. But, there are a small number of us who enjoy those effects haha. Just don't overdo it because dissociatives can definitely induce psychosis if you abuse them wayyy too much. \n",

      "My opinion on the topic is that learning musical theory is not necessary, but it's something that can help a lot when it comes to making music. I say that it's not necessary because for some people, music just comes naturally. They can think of something in their head and they just understand how to take what they hear in their head and create that in their DAW. It can most definitely help to learn musical theory, but at the same time, learning musical theory won't make you a musical god. I think pretty much everyone understands that, but in my opinion, creating music involves a lot of creativity and creativity isn't something that can necessarily be learned in a classroom or from a book. It's just something that comes naturally for you. I don't think buying a grand piano is necessary to get good at making music honestly. I come from a musical background, having played several instruments over the course of my life and I think that has definitely helped me with making music because I already have a decent amount of fundamental knowledge of music. The big part about music is being able to come up with something in your head and transferring that to your DAW, or in general, whatever you use to make music, whether that be a piano, guitar, etc. etc. \n",

There are no other disorders where pathological dissociation is an actual symptom of another disorder. It's only a symptom of dissociative disorders.

Mental illness is not like a physical illness, especially things like dissociative disorders. Dissociative disorders are an extreme defense mechanism used as a last resort to protect your psyche from experiencing overwhelming negative emotions. Through things like therapy, you can dig deep into your mind and learn what it is that caused you to resort to pathological dissociation and learn techniques to help bring you back. I have suffered from SEVERE Depersonalization Disorder almost my entire life due to a fucked up childhood and I have made a 100% full recovery at age 20. People CAN get better. I'm not saying EVERYONE who gets Depersonalization Disorder WILL get better, what I'm saying is that people CAN get better.

It's something you recover from and something you learn to accept as being a part of who you are. I have done extensive research on all dissociative disorders and the thing about what pathological dissociation is, is that it is an extreme defense mechanism against a highly threat perceived environment. It's your mind literally tuning you out from experiencing the world through your emotions as a means of protecting your psychological well being. Despite whatever you want to believe, everyone who suffers from a dissociative disorder is a trauma survivor. That's a fact that any therapist who has extensive experience with treating dissociative disorders will tell you. I have made a 100% full recovery and I understand that Depersonalization Disorder is something I will live with for the rest of my life. You can't unsee the Depersonalized/Derealized world. You can't. I can most definitely feel it creeping back sometimes when I start getting overloaded with stress. The difference now is that I have coping skills to help alleviate stress and have outlets to allow myself to FEEL my feelings instead of rejecting their existence. I feel that anyone who goes through what we have gone through will come out an infinitely better person and have a much bigger appreciation for life that most people take for granted. \n",

Not sure how this translates to the things you're doing but I know the i5, especially overclocked, can handle what you need it to handle.

      "AFAIK, there are some companies that will custom build you a laptop, but they are in no way comparable to desktops. A laptop is literally built in a way so that the laptop case itself fits the components in there perfectly. The issue is exactly that though. If you wish to upgrade any of the hardware, it is extremely difficult because you have to 100% know that the hardware you want to replace will actually fit in the laptop. That's why I always recommend you get a desktop if you're planning on having a machine that will last you a while to play video games on. There's like no way you could upgrade a graphics card on a laptop to an actual dedicated graphics card. And the thing with laptops is that if you have a dedicated graphics card in it, the laptop is going to be huge and bulky which a good amount of people would prefer not to have such a massive laptop. Also, the thing with laptops is that they tend to cost more money as compared to desktops with similar hardware. \n",

See, with psychosis, a big aspect of it is being completely unaware of it which is why I'm hesitant to label you as such. People with psychosis aren't able to step outside themselves and think, \"obviously this isn't real.\" It sounds like you were experiencing panic attacks that were triggered by pot. This happens for some people. I would suggest you not use drugs for a while and see how that plays out. No legitimate doctor would ever label someone mentally ill because they experience weird symptoms while under the influence of a drug. They're drugs, and yeah, the effects you got aren't typical of someone on weed, but you're still under the influence of a DRUG. If you were experiencing psychotic symptoms while SOBER, that's a whole nother story. But again, you seem WAY too aware of what is happening to you for me to think you're psychotic. It sounds 100% to me like anxiety and a big component of anxiety is fearing that you are losing your mind, especially when you first start experiencing bad anxiety/panic attacks.

      "I think that argument would make more sense if I wasn't taking the same dosage everyday. I'm convinced the short term memory effects dissipate, at least to a pretty noticeable degree, when you develop tolerance. My understanding of anticholinergics are that they are a class of drugs that plug your choline receptors to block acetylcholine from being binded to them.The dosage depends on how many of the receptors get plugged. I felt like I noticed slight short term memory issues in the beginning, but I feel like they're not there whatsoever anymore. I don't struggle at all with short term memory issues. I'm not saying what I'm doing is safe, but what I'm saying is that I don't buy how bad you're making it out to be for my brain unless I was continuously upping the dosage.\n",

But as you consume caffeine for a longer period of time, you develop a tolerance. How? Your mind is always trying to maintain homeostasis and to combat this blockage of adenosine receptors, your mind builds more receptors so that you don't have this wicked buildup of adenosine and you develop a tolerance to the drug because of this. I believe Diphenhydramine works the exact same way. That at first, you may notice short term memory, but if you take the similar dosages everyday, your brain just builds more choline receptors to compensate. \n",

The BEST syrup brands are made by two companies called CareOne and TopCare. They are both DXM only products and they are normally advertised as being \"children's brand\" syrup.

      "\n",
      "Depending on how you dose, I can recommend some helpful tips. I used to puke from DXM as well but over time, I learned to not even get nauseous from it. \n",
      "\n",
      "First off, ALWAYS dose on an empty stomach. When you have food in your stomach, it takes longer for the effects to kick in. Since DXM is a dissociative drug, the quicker it kicks in, the faster the dissociation kicks in and when you're dissociated, you don't feel nauseous anymore. Also, when you have food in your stomach, since it takes longer, you will experience the stomach discomfort for a longer period of time as compared to an empty stomach and the longer you feel nauseous, the more likely you are to cave in and puke. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, after dosing, doesn't matter if you use syrup or gels, eat a small snack. Avoid sweets. Eat something grainy and salty such as saltine crackers or pretzels. I find this helps to soak up the DXM and also soothe your stomach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, if you are using gels, swallow all of the gels with a soothing beverage such as ginger ale. Ginger ale helps to soothe your stomach and also tastes good (at least for me it does). \n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, and I've found this is a BIG thing.. after dosing, just lay down for the entire come up. Just lay down on your couch or bed because I find that moving around too much irritates your stomach when it's digesting the syrup or gels which can lead to nausea and puking. Laying down not only helps soothe your stomach, but it's relaxing. Relaxing is so key to avoiding nausea.\n",
      "\n",
      "IF you get nauseous, I know this is hard, but DO NOT feed into it. Don't think about it. Just relax and let it be. If you relax, the feeling tends to dissipate. The more you feed into the nausea, the more nauseous you get, and the more nauseous you get, the more likely you are to puke. If you start feeling nausea, don't fight it. I highly suggest you try meditating if you feel nauseous. I find this helps tremendously.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people, and I used to be convinced I was one of these people until I discovered how to alleviate nausea, will just puke no matter what. I don't 100% buy the sorbitol issue because I have taken DXM products that contain absolutely no sorbitol and STILL had nausea and diarrhea. DXM in and of itself can cause nausea. Plenty of people who have taken pure DXM still report they get nauseous. The big thing is to just not feed into it and just let it flow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing that may help is taking an antacid. Some people report relief with this but I found that I didn't need it because I didn't feel like it did anything. Also, if you're going to use DPH with DXM to help with nausea, take it 30 to 45 minutes before dosing the DXM so that when the DXM is kicking in, the DPH has already taken effect instead of taking both at the same time and the effects come up at the same time. Hopefully this helps. \n",

I have really bad year round allergies, and I feel that taking Diphenhydramine at the doses I take it actually protect me from allergies everyday for the most part.

      "DXM is a totally underrated drug. It's easily one of the most powerful substances in existence and only people who have used DXM, especially in high doses, understand this. It's comparable to other dissociatives in its class such as Ketamine and PCP. There's a few things that make DXM very magical. One, is that DXM is an EXTREMELY potent serotonergic drug. Its effects on serotonin are absolutely nuts. And unlike MDMA, DXM has an afterglow (for a majority of people, not everyone). Most people report with MDMA that they either go back to baseline after the drug wears off, or feel kinda depressed after. With DXM, it's the total opposite. Most people experience a blissful afterglow. So, the second thing that makes DXM so magical is that unlike other dissociatives like Ketamine, DXM lasts a LONG time. For some people, that's kind of a turn off. But for me, I LOVE how long it lasts. \n",

What the meds helped me with is taking the edge off and just allowing me to see life in a different way. Over time of exposing your mind to new perspectives, you start focusing more on the external world rather than the hyper internalized internal world. And over time you're like \"wait a second, I've been getting so caught up in REALITY instead of my DP I didn't even notice how much better I feel!\" Like it's seriously great to be back and I'm so happy to see others who have recovered. We will all have DP the rest of our fucking lives. That's not up for debate. But to me, RECOVERY is when you become the master of your own mind and instead of DP controlling you, YOU control DP. DP is just an aspect of who I am and I accept and love it at the same time. I feel myself slipping back sometimes but so what? It's a feeling like all other feelings that instead of fighting it, I allow it to flow through me like all other feelings because like all other feelings, it will pass if I let it and not fight it. Fighting DP only fuels it and makes it worse. Letting your feelings flow is what being alive feels like. \n",

A regular recreational dosage of MDMA doesn't cause serotonin syndrome, SSRI's actually normally dampen the effects of a decent amount of drugs such as MDMA, mushrooms, and LSD. The main issue is that when taking drugs like MDMA or LSD, sometimes people put other chemicals on the blotter or pill so maybe it's MDMA laced with another drug or just not MDMA at all and the drug that is on it is capable of causing serotonin syndrome when mixed with SSRI's. That's why you need to exercise extreme caution when combining the two unless you know for a fact what you have is actually MDMA or LSD.\n",

I think the big thing is getting your mind to relax to expose yourself back to reality to truly feel alive to remind your mind how much you love life is a big part of getting better. I definitely feel myself slipping back every so often but the thing is that I now have way better control over calming myself down and bringing myself back than I used to.

When you feel yourself snapping out of it and you're able to hold onto that feeling, it's just amazing and I believe each and everyone of us is capable of doing that. And it's definitely a gradual process, not something that happens in an instant. I think a big component is being aware of things that trigger your DP because those are the things that start warping me back into DP. The hard part is learning how to not let those things get to you in a way that you numb out. I feel like a big part of DP is trying to fight your feelings instead of allowing those feelings to be a part of you. I find that the resistance of negative feelings is a lot of what DP is. You just gotta let negative feelings flow through you because that what being alive is. You're going to feel shitty in life, that's just a part of it. But you'll also feel great in life.

I feel like instead of DP controlling me, I now have control over it. I feel a lot better than I used to when it was more severe. I think yeah, you learn to live with it over time which by relaxing, you feel yourself actually coming back to reality and you're like holy shit I feel ALIVE again. I definitely feel at moments it comes and gos but in general I have a much better grip on it now and when I feel myself slipping back, I know how to bring myself back and I understand that DP is just a feeling and not to let in control me and ruin my life.\n",

I did plenty of drugs while I had DP/DR because I felt that I'd rather feel something than nothing but I don't feel as though drugs caused or helped it in any way.

The amount of CCC's you have to take to get a high dose of DXM requires you take an excessive dose of CPM. Although your body can withstand both drugs in high doses by themselves, in combination, it's extremely dangerous. One, both drugs are broken down by the CYP2D6 liver enzyme and when two drugs that need extensive use of the same liver enzyme compete for that enzyme to break them down, it potentiates the effects of both drugs significantly. Second, CPM compared to other 1st generation antihistamines has more powerful serotonergic effects and taking this into account along with the potentiation due to cytochrome inhibition, you can get serotonin syndrome. You're playing with your life by dosing high with triple C's. I honestly don't know why you'd even take them considering they're in the same aisle as DXM only products. Having trouble finding DXM only products in your area also wouldn't be an excuse because again, this is your life we're talking about.

      "The way I've heard DXM described is it's a drug that's broken down in thirds. A third of the people who try it will love it, a third will hate it, and a third will be indifferent to it. It seems to be pretty consistent with those who I know have taken DXM. I don't know many people who have taken recreational doses of DXM but I do know the ones that have seem to have pretty varying feelings about it. I think the big thing about DXM and the same can probably be said about PCP as well, is that DXM lasts a very long time. See with Ketamine, for one, snorting it has lower bioavailability than IM'ing it and the effects only last a couple hours at best, allowing for it to be enjoyed more by people. Whereas DXM and PCP last a VERY long time and your forced to be stuck in this dissociative state for upwards of 8 hours. Along with lasting a long time, DXM is very powerful and can easily overwhelm a person if they're not into these kinds of drugs. The way one of my friends described taking DXM once at a dose of 900mg was that it was unbelievably powerful and WEIRD. lol \n",

He ended up in the emergency room where he tested positive for both PCP and Opiates. His conclusion was that the DXM powder he had purchased was not pure, but there is every reason to believe that it may have been pure DXM which caused both of these false positives.(2)\n",

They tested twenty individuals after either 20 or 40 mg doses of DXM and found that none tested positive for Opiates 72 hours later (using EMIT).(3) Obviously this is a significantly lower dose than most recreational users choose. The primary thing this tells us is that it might be difficult to use medicinal DXM use as an excuse for testing positive for Opiates.\n",

If anyone has had an experience with using DXM before a drug test, whether it caused a false positive or not, please consider filling out an experience report letting us know how much DXM was taken, how long before the drug test, any information known about what type of drug test was used, and the results of the test (with as many details as possible).\n",

      "You didn't overdose, you just had a bad trip on a 4th plateau dose. That's why I don't like the 4th plateau because it's so unpredictable. I've taken 4th plateau trips 2 or 3 times. The first time I did it, it was horrible and I thought the whole time that I was gonna die or was already dead. The last time I did it was like a week ago and it was really nice. 4th plateau is when you enter the dissociative hole. It's a whole nother experience not comparable to the other 3 plateaus. Strong CEV's and OEV's on this dose, coupled with mental confusion, strong depersonalization and derealization to the point you everything seems extremely alien and you might even astral project. Everything is just super unfamiliar, kind of like how a newborn baby feels when entering this world. So given all this, if you start experiencing anxiety/panic attacks, it can go south real fast. This is why I really only like going as far as a high 3rd plateau dose because I've only had bad trips on the 4th plateau. \n",

Dihydrocodeine and dextromethorphan, both central acting antitussive drugs, significantly increased the release of [3H]5-HT from slices of the rat NTS. Furthermore, these antitussive drugs significantly increased the rate of turnover of the 5-HT in the brainstem.

Once a 500 some milligram bottle, and another the same dose with 300mg HBr. Most people report more visuals from poli which I can concur with because the time I combined HBr and Poli, I got more visuals from a lower plat dose than I would with HBr alone. A lot of people report HBr having being a stronger dissociative trip than poli. This would be due to the difference in DXM to DXO conversion between the two substances. \n",

      "Like others said, I think your best bet is to probably not dabble into drugs. Obviously what you don't want to hear. A lot of people with severe mental illness abuse drugs, some may have positive experiences, some can be very negative. I've been to a psych ward 2 times (not psychosis related) and have seen how severe mental illness can effect people. The big issue with any mental illness that can lead to psychosis is that when you're psychotic, you lack the insight to recognize something is wrong. For example, this one guy I talked to my first time in the psych ward, I'll call him X. So X had SEVERE bipolar disorder. When I met him, that was his 11th time being hospitalized for his bipolar disorder because what ends up happening is he gets so manic he does completely ridiculous things, is borderline psychotic, and the cops eventually get involved and he ends up back there. X was actually really cool though, we talked a lot about philosophy and spirituality so he definitely helped me pass the time in there. But the one thing about X, was the more I talked to him, the more I realized this guy has a seriously pronounced lack of insight into how his mental illness is actually effecting him. In fact, the reason he was in there that specific time was because he was really manic, smoked a bunch of weed, and was taking his wooden sword (he does martial arts) and smashing trees at his parents house and drove his sword into the lawn to release negative energy from it. Cops got involved and ends up there. My point to this is that when you suffer from severe mental illness, most sufferers claim that they have a grip on it but then inevitably end up back in the psych ward because they underestimate their mental illness. X would go on and on about how he doesn't need medication and how he's completely fine, but then in group therapy the therapists brought up how the reason he's ended up here 11 times (and will probably end up there 11 more times) is that he takes his medication for a tiny bit, decides he doesn't need it anymore, and then becomes manic and ends up back there. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you are going to dabble into substances irregardless of what someone says, I would suggest using a mild substance such as pot (which for people with mental illness may not be so mild) with a close friend who can help you if anything goes wrong. Also, if you are on antipsychotics, those drugs can prevent you from getting high on a lot of substances and it's not worth stopping medication to get high which could possibly lead you back to the psych ward. Stay safe man, irregardless of what you choose. \n",

Either way, the one thing with benzos is that if you're not an anxious person, you probably won't notice much effects besides what you mentioned, the degradation of motor function. And to be straight up, benzos don't really provide much of a high. There's not much \"euphoria\" per se, it's more so just to help mellow you out. I find it's more noticeable if you smoke some weed with it. Your friends probably like it because they've got some sort of daily stress i.e. insecurities, anxiety, etc. so when they take it, it feels like a big weight off their shoulders. For you, you're probably just a more mellow person which you make sense why you don't notice much effects. And just to forewarn you, don't take too much. If you've taken an entire bar and didn't notice much, taking more is just gonna make you black out and you'll end up most likely doing something dumb that you'll regret once you sober up. I've had similar experiences with benzos as well like you. I've taken up to 11mg of Klonopin in one day and hardly noticed anything.

      "Nah it happens to me plenty if I get really stoned. I'll hear voices but they're mostly just saying inaudible nonsense, nothing specific like, \"that drink is poisoned.\" Doesn't make you crazy. If you only hear auditory hallucinations on drugs, then yeah, you're fine. It's when you hear voices while sober and the voices are loud and say specific things that it is a sign of mental illness. But even then, hearing voices in and of itself is not indicative of mental illness. There are people out there who hear voices who aren't mentally ill. Hearing voices is what most people associate with Schizophrenia, but Schizophrenia encompasses a whole host of symptoms, not just hearing voices, and people who are becoming psychotic do not possess the insight to recognize something is wrong with them. The fact you have a solid sense of awareness of what's going on shows there's nothing wrong with you.\n",

If you take a 3rd plateau, rule of thumb you should wait 3 weeks before your next trip. This is to avoid getting a tolerance to the drug. I read your previous posts where I was the one who brought up enzyme deficiency to you and the effects you described are not consistent with a 4.85mg/kg trip. I understand everyone reacts differently to drugs but the effects you got were way more powerful than you should have gotten with that dose. You don't sound like you're extremely deficient, but you definitely sound deficient enough to where you should be careful with this substance. As Kitty mentioned, she gets powerful effects from that similar dose but weighs considerably less than you so what she experiences makes sense. \n",

The enzyme deficiency can potentiate the effects of DXM by 2 to 3 times as much and can last a bit longer than someone without the enzyme deficiency. If I were you, I would follow the week per plateau rule and slowly work your way up to see how DXM effects you because you can seriously hurt yourself if you're not careful. People with the enzyme deficiency can still enjoy DXM, you just need to understand how your body reacts to it so you don't hurt yourself.

      "\n",
      "ONE, before ever trying to trip on DXM, take a small dose of around ~100mg and see how that effects you. Don't dose any further that night, just ride that out. Reason being is that some people are deficient in the enzyme that breaks down DXM and if you consume 1200mg of DXM with an enzyme deficiency, you will most likely die or be in the hospital for a few days. The enzyme deficiency can amplify the effects of DXM by 2 to 3 times as much and cause the effects to last a lot longer as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "TWO, if what you want is to play video games, 1200mg (pretty much 4th plateau for anyone) would not be possible. DXM is a pretty underrated and underused drug because of Triple C's making their way in the media as a cheap way kids get high and sometimes die on. DXM is an extremely powerful dissociative drug and it's most notable effects occur on the third plateau and above. DXM is best enjoyed while laying down in a dark room with headphones on, listening to music. DXM will take you places man. Expect to be seeing yourself floating over cities while also experiencing tactile hallucinations of floating in the air. DXM is the only drug I've had tactile hallucinations on, as in looking down at my body and seeing my body being morphed into different directions and actually FEELING my body being morphed in those directions. Also, powerful spiritual insights into yourself and the world around you are common on high doses. \n",
      "\n",
      "THREE, I probably don't have to say this, but make sure what you are taking has DXM as the only active ingredient. For a full on, mind blowing dissociative trip, I recommend HBr over Polistirex. Also, finding a product that doesn't contain Sorbitol is also recommended but not mandatory. Sorbitol can make you feel very ill i.e. nausea, diarrhea, puking, feeling like you're about to pass out. Everyone has their own individual sensitivity to it. Some are very sensitive and find high doses of Sorbitol to be unbearable. Like I said, it can even make some people feel faint and inevitably pass out. Out of all the products I have tried, the CareOne syrup brand is the best in terms of having no sorbitol and also its taste. No gross menthol with the syrup either. \n",
      "\n",
      "FOUR, DXM lasts a LONG time. The trip itself can last (depending on dose) at least 8 hours, so make sure you have nothing to do the next day, ESPECIALLY if taking a large dose. I don't think I'd recommend a 4th plateau for your first trip. Third plateau if you really want but for some, it can be way too much for your first time. It's not like Ketamine where within a few hours of intense tripping, you're fine. It lasts so long and it feels like it just keeps getting stronger and stronger over time. The reason I say make sure you have nothing to do the next day is that on large doses, you will still have noticeable robowalk even 12+ hours after dosing. Don't even think about driving. I've taken third plateau doses the night before work and had to call off because I knew that even so long after dosing, there's no way I could possibly drive as I could barely use my legs. \n",

The issue being that most DXM products contain Sorbitol and the dosage you'd be taking to get blasted on DXM would mean you'd have to consume a wicked amount of Sorbitol which can make you feel very ill i.e. vomiting and diarrhea. What I would recommend is to find this DXM only syrup by CareOne, grape flavored, as it contains no sorbitol. It's also the best tasting cough syrup by far. It smells exactly like grape soda. The taste, meh .. but way better than robitussin. It kinda tastes like grape soda with a chemical taste to it with the consistency of expired milk. I would recommend irregardless to take 50 - 100 mg of DPH 30 - 60 minutes before dosing the DXM as DPH has pretty nice antiemetic properties and can also ramp up the visuals of the trip. \n",

Grossest puke ever. Tasted like liquid benzedrex. But once I puked it all out, that gross benzedrex taste in my mouth went away. The drug is kind of weird though because when I take 250 mg, I get the good feels but never any negative comedown and actually find it pretty easy to sleep even when taking the dose at night. But like yesterday taking 500 mg, mentally I was fine but physically I felt horrible. Despite the fact I dosed at noon, I couldn't sleep whatsoever last night. I might have managed to sleep an hour at most. The whole night I had constant tachycardia and hypertension. My body just couldn't chill out whatsoever.

Using nitrous like once or twice a week in moderate dosages won't do any real damage. I'd also recommend you not use balloons and do that stupid thing where people hyperventilate themselves on ballons. If you're getting a whipped cream dispenser, just inhale it straight from the can.

Now, I don't know if he's actually psychotic or not. Some people can just start acting really bizarre but not be psychotic. Main issue being is that if he is psychotic or in the process of becoming psychotic, no amount of reasoning can convince him of this. I think the best thing to do is to make sure you and your friends stay in touch with him and monitor how he's doing. Don't be overboard with it, just make it natural and make him feel like he's got a good support network. I'd also suggest you contact his family members and see if they have noticed any changes in his behavior and that they should probably keep an eye on him.

Benzos are probably the worst thing you could be taking daily because of how deathly addictive they are and benzos are actually shown to significantly worsen anxiety/panic attacks overtime. What SSRI's have you tried? From my research and personal experience, Lexapro is probably the best all around SSRI for what you're experiencing and has a very low side effect profile.

      "Effects of trauma are normally not felt instantly and can be delayed by a significant amount of time. You might have felt other effects that you didn't realize were effects of it at the time such as depression, anxiety, low self esteem, overwhelming stress, etc. etc. Most people may develop is suddenly and what appears to be random when they were actually unaware of problems they were dealing with beforehand. Your early childhood pretty much lays the groundwork for depersonalization and your life went in a way that you ended up becoming depersonalized.\n",

      "Like I said, trauma is subjective and can be subtle. People who grow up in dysfunctional families (most people don't think their family was dysfunctional even though it was) can end up being traumatized because your parents really didn't know how to raise a child in a way that the child could develop a grounded, sense of self and feel safe in this world. Depersonalization, or any form of dissociation, is a defense mechanism. We develop defense mechanisms to protect us from psychological pain. Dissociation is a learned response in childhood which can then be triggered and used as a coping mechanism later in life. A lot of people with DP/DR (not saying you do) have this belief that their life was somehow perfect before DP/DR and that it will be perfect again after they get cured. The issue is that you're coming to those beliefs because at least  before DP/DR, your emotions are what made you feel alive, so when you develop Depersonalization Disorder suddenly, everything seems so strange, lifeless, dead etc. that you feel like life before was near perfect. When you're dissociated, you not only dissociate from yourself and your environment, but you dissociate from traumatic events. Emotional numbing allows you to think about things in the past or experience things in the present with no feelings towards it. So you can imagine then, that when you don't feel emotions, you can't really tell that you were traumatized because you don't feel anything towards past events. And again, these events can be so subtle your mind masks them so well. It's a way of your mind preventing any perceived level of psychological pain from being experienced. \n",

      "Dissociative disorders are essentially a manifestation of undealt with childhood trauma. I say this a lot so I won't type out too much hopefully, but it is pretty much agreed upon by most mental health professionals all dissociative disorders are caused by psychological trauma. Whether or not you believe me or anyone else is besides the point and it makes sense why people wouldn't believe it. Dissociation is basically a downgrade of consciousness and traumatic memories, regardless of how they manifest in adulthood, are buried deep in your mind. To protect you. Trauma isn't something so overtly obvious like being molested or being whipped with a belt every night. I will link sources for you to better read this.\n",

This basically shows that sure, SOMETIMES your DP/DR may just go away on it's own (normally it does not and you should never assume it will), but because the root cause was never dealt with, your mind will still resort to dissociation when faced with stress. You need to seek professional mental health treatment by a therapist experienced with treating dissociative disorders or any trauma survivors for that matter. It's good you at least recognize there is a problem early on and I hope you will take the right steps towards recovery. Don't be put off by set backs because they WILL happen. Good luck.\n",

Like how your parents seem like cool people some times while at others seem to not make any sense whatsoever. Like pampering you excessively and then transitioning to being cold or emotionally abusive. Things like tuning out when your parents are giving you a hard time over and over. That's dissociation.

Even people still on SSRI's will take DXM and be fine (but I obviously would never advise this as any risk in serotonin syndrome is not worth it). For the amount of time you took it, I don't even think your body reached a peak plasma concentration of the drug. The half life of Zoloft is about ~26 hours so at this point, there is hardly any Zoloft in your system. The risk would be more worth noting if you took an SSRI with a longer half life and had taken it for an extended period of where it reached peak plasma concentration (not as in the full 10 mg taking effect, I mean when you take a drug at consistently, everyday for a period of time when it has a long half life, your peak plasma concentration over time will increase to a point and then plateau). \n",

I was lucky enough to have been given a great one on my first time after being hospitalized. He's well aware of dissociative disorders and has experience with treating them. He is very real with me. Dissociative disorders are among the hardest mental health issues to treat. Amnesia is a big aspect of dissociation, as in forgetting traumatic events in your life. Dissociation normally occurs in the context of complex trauma, as in not one single event. It was multiple, compounded events over a period of time that led to it, which was definitely the case for me. Also it is very hard to get people to let their guard down and begin to experience the world through their emotions again. Emotional numbing also prevents you from even feeling anything towards traumatic experiences. I'll recall stuff that I remember feeling horrible at the time but when thinking about it, I feel numb as usual.\n",

It's not normally until late adolescence or adulthood that something re triggers this response and you start to use that same defense mechanism again as an adult to deal with issues.

I remember reading a post that made it to the front page of reddit about this study showing increase in mood and energy when people who only drink 1L of water a day started drinking 2.5L of water a day and how people who drank 2.5L of water a day started drinking 1L of water a day and experienced lower mood and energy. I'm like no fucking shit. 1L of water??? To put that into perspective, your average water bottle like lets say Deer Park, is half a liter. So imagine drinking only two of those a day. No wonder you feel like shit. \n",

There gets to a point with nitrous where you black out for a short period of time, probably less than 10 seconds and you're like, \"wtf just even happened?\" That's normally how I'd come to on the floor with a bruise on my face. I can't imagine it's from oxygen deprivation though because I use a whipped cream dispenser and always made sure to get plenty of oxygen after each whippet. Plenty of other people report the same experience as me. Best thing to do on nitrous though is listen to music. Music is amazing on nitrous.\n",

In the context of a child experiencing dissociation when experiencing stress/trauma, it's adaptive because it allows the person to tolerate the overwhelming stress created by whatever the child feels in danger of.

He's well aware of dissociative disorders and has experience with helping treat and cure them. He himself has dealt with interpersonal issues as well which is why he became a therapist, but nothing severe like DP/DR. \n",

      "A big issue is that plenty of therapists/psychiatrists know what DP/DR is (as in they know that it exists), they just have absolutely no idea on how to treat it. I feel like it's not really their fault though because there seems to be a huge lack of understanding of what dissociative disorders are really like and what causes them. Sure, you can say there's a huge link between trauma and dissociative disorders but after I've done quite a lot of thinking, there's a shit ton of stuff I've come up with that contributes to them. Eventually I'm gonna type out a huge ass subjective report on my own experiences and information about what I believe causes it. Of course I understand it's not a black and white issue where I can say THIS is the cause and ignore the rest of anything else, but I think I'm kinda on to something. \n",

      "This seems like a mind over matter type issue and you've associated DXM with nausea so just the act of swallowing a DXM product starts churning up your stomach and making you gag. You just gotta relax and not think about nausea. I know it's way easier said than done but I know so many people who grasp this concept agree. Best ways to ingest are ALWAYS on an empty stomach because it kicks in faster and you climb through the plateaus much faster so the dissociation kicks in faster so the nausea goes away as fast as it presents itself. Swallow the gels with a soothing beverage such as ginger ale. Afterwards, have a small, salty snack like goldfish or saltine crackers. I literally just swallowed 40 gels (600mg) while typing this lol Now currely munchin on some saltines. \n",

The second reason being is that you said you puked within like 30 minutes which in all my days of doin dxm, lurking around the dxm websticle, etc. that's unheard of and you probably had some weird subconscious association with nausea or maybe your body just wasn't feelin right that day and you puked and now you only associate it with nausea. \n",

They mostly occur with MAOI's or DXM products that contain Chlorpheniramine Maleate. Most SSRI's are broken down by the same enzyme that DXM is broken down by and this competition can cause the effects to be magnified and last longer, which is the same exact thing Chlorpheniramine does. \n",

I know for a fact my bad childhood has everything to do with my DP/DR, anxiety, depression, etc. It all revolves around love. I had a fucked up, chaotic, and nonexistent relationship with my parents which I believe then led to me having odd relationships with other people. I never was able to have love reciprocated. Love is really what destroyed me. I'm now just an empty and sometimes angry/narcissistic person because of it. \n",

My second to last time doing it, I packed like a geeb and a half and had the worst drug experience of my life. I convinced myself I was dying and I swear like 20 times during the high, my vision would completely go white and I'd say to myself, \"welp, I'm dying and this is what you get for smoking K2.\" Did I mention that happened like at least 20 times during that high? I'm not even gonna talk about the other horrifying experiences with that shit. Don't fuck with synthetic weed. \n",

I still feel this constant emotional numbness and slightly taken back from the present moment. It's like I'm so close to breaking free but I can't and I feel like the real world is too much to handle for me emotionally that whenever I do feel 100% better, it doesn't last long at all because my emotions are so fragile I go right back into that almost breaking free state and stay there. I guess it's kind of comforting to not feel hurt about anything but it also gives life no meaning. I stopped thinking the unreality thoughts so long ago but I keep suffering from emotional numbness, lack of motivation, etc. It blows and I really miss feeling raw, genuine emotion. \n",

      "The thing with DP/DR you need to realize is that it's a dissociative disorder, so it's not abnormal for you to be dissociated from your trauma. Social anxiety is directly related to trauma. Sure, you can be predisposed to anxiety, but there has to be something traumatic to cause a direct phobia to something. DP/DR can definitely numb you from your anxiety as well. DP/DR is psychological, not neurological. Many people who are traumatized don't even recognize that they're traumatized because they believe the experiences they grew up in are completely normal. Trauma doesn't have to be something blatantly obvious such as being sexually abused or witnessing catastrophic events in war. Many studies show that people with DP/DR are highly sensitive people and so when you experience anything like bullying, chaotic home life, etc. it can most definitely traumatize you. This trauma can hide itself in your unconscious and you then believe that your life was totally normal, yet your whole life is actually being acted out in a way to prevent you from those uncomfortable feelings, hence the DP/DR. Many people who go to therapy for DP/DR start to uncover traumatic events from their past that they didn't even realize was so traumatic to them. If you want to get better, I'd highly suggest you get Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. \n",

If it's getting worse and you've been dealing with it for years, you need to see a therapist. It's not going to get better on its own. You don't just wake up one day and snap out of it. You need to find the root cause of why you feel this way and eliminate stress from your life. I personally barely notice it anymore and I think it's getting better but I am not 100% better. I feel like if I break free of it, I just go back to DP/DR because my emotions can't handle reality. I don't have the strange DP/DR thoughts unless something triggers intense derealization, but I constantly have emotional numbness.

Trauma is highly subjective and what one person would associate as a traumatic event, another person could brush it off their shoulders. Trauma doesn't have to be some black and white issue like experiencing catastrophic war events or being raped. It could be something as small as small amounts of bullying, strange home life, etc. The issue of not recognizing the actual cause is why most people will relapse back into DP/DR. They can, for however long, manage their anxiety, but the root cause is not solved and so when they are again confronted with heavy amounts of stress, they relapse. This is why DP/DR sufferers greatly benefit from CBT. \n",

      "What is the dosage you're taking? If you're only taking 5 mg that's really strange how you get that nauseous from such a small amount. I've said this in a previous post and I'll say it again. Best thing to do when nauseous on opiates is lay down for a bit. The nausea normally subsides after that. Also, make sure you relax. Getting anxious will only make the problem worse because it increases the acid in your stomach. Try taking the pills with a 1st generation antihistamine such as diphenhydramine, dramamine, or promethazine. These pills are not only great for allergies but help with nausea as well. If you are only taking 5 mg as prescribed and you seriously can't stomach the pills, tell your doctor and I'm sure he can prescribe you something else. But again, I don't know the dosage you are taking which can greatly help in figuring this out.\n",

      "A lot of factors can effect this. Did you have any food in your stomach? My best advice would be to take it on an empty stomach and then eat a snack or light meal after taking the pills. Also, take some benadryl. This can potentiate the effects and also reduce some of the nausea/itchiness. When you feel nauseous on opiates, the best thing to do is lay down for a few minutes (try not to pass out). I find that laying down pretty much eliminates the nausea. 20mg is a pretty high dose for your first time. I took 17.5mg my first time with 50mg diphenhydramine and had a great time. The only nausea I felt was within the first hour of taking it and it completely subsided when I laid down on my bed for a few minutes. \n",

Derealization symptoms that I've experienced are everything seems super high def, people look very clay like, my depth perception is very fucked in that objects look way farther apart than usual, the wall is a flat surface and people look like they're popping up out of a pop up book from the wall. Derealization occurs from a panic attack. It's good to hear that you don't have any symptoms recurring from the experience such as chronic depersonalization. Most likely the weed wasn't laced and sometimes it's very hard to believe that these symptoms can be produced from something as simple as anxiety, but it's true. Normally what is happening is that there is some type of trauma that is not dealt with and these insecurities that have manifested from that trauma attack you in the form of intrusive thoughts, causing a panic attack. This in turn causes the symptoms above, leading to a completely surreal experience. It's a defense mechanism your mind creates to prevent you from feeling distressing emotions by making the external world feel fake and surreal.

That would mean when you see a happy person, you don't feel the slightest bit of jealousy that you wish you could feel that way. Suicidal people have convinced themselves that the only way to take the pain away is to die. And that makes sense because whatever happens when you die must be better than what is right now. It doesn't make them happy thinking that suicide is their answer. Suicide over psychological issues is not rational.

      "Well, most people who have suicidal thoughts rarely kill themselves or even attempt to do so. My point about the Golden Gate Bridge is that once you go there and get dosed up, you're done. There's no going back, and I can guarantee you that almost everyone will regret it the second they do it. People who are suicidal aren't suicidal because they actually want to die, they just don't see any other way to escape the pain. I don't believe there's a single human being out there who truthfully wants to die. It's just their solution to whatever they're going through. But I guarantee while they're waiting for death to kick in, they're probably thinking about how stupid of a decision they just made and how there's absolutely nothing they can do now. \n",

      "Well I'll share something personal with you. I've been suicidal since I was 7 years old, tried to kill myself when I was 10 and still deal with depression. However, I'm much happier than I used to be and I've never once taken medication or been to a psychologist about my issues. I had a bad life both in school and at home. However, with actively trying to make myself happier, it's worked. There are in fact things you can do to make yourself happier. We are molded into the person we are by things that are completely out of our control. However, psychological pain and physiological pain are two different things. You can LEARN to be happy and enjoy life, something I used to think was complete bullshit. It took me a long time to realize this. It's not a life sentence. Nobody needs medication. Your thoughts have such a profound impact on your psyche. If you sit in your house all day doing nothing but dwelling on how life sucks, well, no wonder you're not getting any better. Go out, learn something, hang out with people, go into nature and just stare into the beauty that is life and realize that this is YOUR life. YOU are in control. YOU have the power to make a difference in your life and in other peoples lives. Guess what? If you make it out of your depression, you yourself could become a great counselor because you actually have EXPERIENCE into the depression mindset and can help others which will fill you with nothing but utter and complete happiness. I guarantee you pretty much everyone who has jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge completely regretted it the second they jumped. You have the power to change yourself and help is out there, whether it's something you learn from someone else, or something you learn from yourself. I've seen people recover from horrible traumatic childhoods. It's possible.\n",

      "If you visit some e-cig forums, or any vape related subreddit, you'll see people talking about how their blood pressure dropped to a healthy level, they can breathe significantly better than before, their sense of smell and taste has drastically improved, etc. The buzz you get is different though. Nicotine is just one chemical found in tobacco. Tobacco also contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are extremely powerful antidepressants. MAOI's are last of the line antidepressant drugs for people with treatment resistant depression and they are pretty much guaranteed to work. The MAOI's in tobacco are not nearly as profound as the ones in pill form, but they nonetheless effect your consciousness in a significant way and add to the cigarette's unique buzz. \n",

      "I have heard so many stories of people who smoked for a decade or more, trying all different types of products to help them quit smoking, and then they tried vaping and quit smoking overnight. I would most definitely give it a try. All the studies that say vaping is bad are by Big Tobacco trying to not lose business, as does the government with losing taxes on tobacco. I would highly suggest you not get one of those Blu e-cigs or any of those shitty ones found in gas stations. They're made by Big Tobacco and want the FDA to put restrictions on vaping so that those are the only ones that get sold. Plus they're absolutely terrible. \n",

      "Most of the time, people who say they don't like vaping who used to be smokers is because they try those shitty e-cigs. The really crappy ones provide very little flavor and usually don't satisfy the smoker. If you want a good idea of what will help you get into vaping, go to your local vape shop and just talk to the guys that work there. I find most vape shops to have great employees who really know what they're talking about. \n",

We can't make a valid argument for e-cigarettes because they haven't been around that long. Short term studies exist, but short term studies don't really mean anything. You can take a short term study on caffeine and say it's dangerous because one who does not consume caffeine regularly experiences increased blood pressure, heart rate, and anxiety from it. However, long term studies show caffeine is not a detriment to your health as long as you have no serious heart conditions. \n",

The withdrawals normally subside within a couple days, and the only things I notice are anger/irritation, increased energy, and a decrease in concentration. \n",

That's like taking a study that documents short term effects on caffeine and saying caffeine is dangerous because a user who never drinks caffeine experiences increased blood pressure, stress, anxiety, etc. However, long-term studies show caffeine is not a detriment to your health assuming you have no serious heart conditions. The short term studies on nicotine are done mainly on people who don't vape regularly, so of course, with no tolerance, you will experience a negative adverse effect, but is this effect consistent throughout a lifetime of use?

You can display factual information to people as to why smoking pot isn't dangerous to individuals or society, or how gay marriage doesn't effect them, but these beliefs they hold are reality to them. Strong social conditioning creates and reinforces these beliefs. It be like all of a sudden waking up from a coma and realizing this entire life you've been living is a lie and now you have to readjust to this new world. Change can't happen overnight even though we'd like it to. The reason you have your beliefs is because you were lucky to be raised in an environment where these ideas were reality to you, just as a racist persons beliefs are reality to them.

      "WILD's are very difficult because you have to time your sleep cycle correctly so that you immediately dive into REM sleep. You cannot do this when going to bed at night where you are going to sleep for like 8 hours. Like Vintage said, sleep for 6 hours, wait a little bit, and then go back to bed and keep focusing on lucid dreaming. WILD lucid dreams are awesome hahaha, they're easier if you take a nap during the day though. This reminds me of my first WILD when I took a nap and I was flying through this beautiful valley for like 20 minutes having the time of my life. Keep at it, but WILD's are very difficult to master.\n",

Based on science though, our brains actually make decisions for us SECONDS before the decision even becomes a conscious thought. Just because I am able to consciously experience my thoughts doesn't mean I actually have control over them. My thoughts are the result of my genetics and the environment which shape our thinking. Some argue though, that we do have free will, but not in the sense that we are able to do whatever it is we want. It's a restrictive sense of free will, in that we don't have an influence of who we are, our wants, desires, etc. but we are able to have restrictive will of those wants and desires, which I'm in somewhat agreement on.  Example: I didn't will myself to like pie, but I do know that I like pumpkin pie over pecan pie, so I willed myself to eat pumpkin pie versus the latter.\n",

It's a whole different experience in and of itself and is amazing for self reflection and spiritual insight. The only thing that sucks is the nausea gets worse as you take more, so I'd suggest 50mg Diphenhydramine, weed, and pepto bismol or some other antacid tablet.
