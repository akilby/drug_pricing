      "Things people do not tell you about heroin \n",
      "1. Chinga babies- after you have been hooked on opiates for any period of time, you can no longer poop well on your own. When you enter a period of sickness, you may give \"birth\" to a chinga baby. This is when you suddenly have to poop and an enormous hard poop the length of your colon decides to come out an an inopportune time tearing apart your booty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Coagulated blood hits- when you cannot find a vein, you may put a syringe clogged with blood and dope to the side. At some later time, a few hours or even a day down the road, you may rethink that hit. I have taken the liquid out, picked out the clots and stuck that right back in my arm. I also did a few of Ben's coagulated blood hits. Ahhh love! \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Impotence- Shhh. It's a secret unless you have ever fucked a male addict. After awhile, things do not work in the nether regions. Unless they take a hit of crack or speed. Then, he is too busy looking for white specs on the carpet to get busy. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. No periods. Yes ladies, your period may stop. Or you thought it stopped but you actually are pregnant but did not know because you have not had a period. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. You may very likely fall asleep with food in you mouth. Amazingly, you may just re chew and swallow that same tasty morsel later. This may be something along the lines of grahamn crackers, a cinnamon roll, etc. As yummy as it sounds, it is WAY better than trying to spit that stuff out with a pasty mouth. \n",
      "\n",
      "6. If you nod off next to a person who is also nodding, they may burn you. There is nothing more irritating that waking up to your shirt or the bed on fire. Add a few klonopin in that mix, you may wake up engulfed in flames. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. No matter how many times you say you will cuss the connection out, you never will do it. You will wait patiently in the rain for 1-2 hours envisioning acts of violence on said dealer then thank them when they hand you your stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. If you are selling drugs, everyone hates you. Yes, I know, you also use them so you think it is cool. It is not- they hate you. Trust me. Worse than a junkie is a junkie that then sells drugs- you have betrayed the sacred order of the spoon.\n",

      "I knew this topic would interest you all so I shot some questions to one of the producers Marcela Gaviria.\n",
      "1. How does this program differ from other shows on the topic? \n",
      "There is some terrific reporting on the epidemic.  I think in two hours we cover not just the origins of the epidemic, we report on why the epidemic has not been abated and we examine what needs to be changed in order to contain the worst drug epidemic in our history.  It's all told through intimate and deeply revelatory stories of three addicts, a suburban mom, a 21 year old female from a middle class background, a musician who is now homeless. \n",
      "2. With so many different opinions on what is needed, was there anything that stood out as solutions or themes? \n",
      "The Obama administration is reviewing the restrictions on prescribing for medication assisted treatment, and from the experts we spoke with, it seems relaxing those rules could be a good start. We could also require insurance plans to include coverage for more than 30 days of inpatient treatment. That’s clearly not enough time to get someone clean.  \n",
      "3. How did you recruit users? \n",
      "I spent a lot of time interviewing possible participants, listening to their life stories.  Sometimes I met them at drug court.  Others I met through the LEAD program in Seattle.   I was introduced to many people in the course of making this film.  I settled for participants that really touched me with their candidness, intelligence and ultimately their struggle.\n",
      "4. How did you recruit family members? \n",
      "That was a lot tougher.  Once I had settled on my participants, I wanted to talk to their extended family about how addiction had impacted their lives, but many didn't want to participate.  The stigma of addiction is still so great.  I was very pleased that I managed to include Kristina's father in this film.  The portrait of a father struggling through his daughter's addiction was very powerful to witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. What do you feel are the take away messages from the program? \n",
      "I think the big takeaway is that this epidemic is not unlike the AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. Back then, we rallied to come up with solutions. We aren’t doing enough now.  Access to treatment is inadequate. Services stink. Relapse rates are way too high. There aren’t enough studies to tell us what works and what doesn’t work. Over half a million people have died from opiate overdoses in the last 15 years. We clearly can do better.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to humanize addiction.  It's time we talk about this differently.  To quote the former Deputy Drug Czar, Tom McLellan, \"We're\n",
      " gonna continue to pay the price for thinking of this as a lifestyle issue, a personality disorder. We're gonna pay that price for a very long time because it's standing in our way of medical progress, of public health progress.\"\n",

      "BANGOR – Coleen Sheran Singer (born Coleen Sheran Clark) would have turned 33 this August 31, but she died in Lewiston in an unsuspecting suburban professional couple’s home of a heroin overdose on the morning of December 25, 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a victim of herself, of LePage’s politics, of our society’s continuing ignorance and indifference to mental illness, and of our society’s asinine approach to drug addiction. Born in Biddeford and raised near OOB, Coleen lived the last three years of her life mostly as a transient in the Bangor area with increasing problems with infections in her limbs, a lack of MaineCare to pay for antibiotics outside the hospital, and escalating problems with the law following misdemeanor illegal drug possession convictions, failures to appear and a 2009 conviction for solicitation of prostitution. Coleen’s father left when she was younger than two. Coleen’s mother doted on Coleen when she was a child and made a good home for her, but barely eked out a living working long hours cleaning houses and motel rooms. Coleen’s mother was abused as a child in foster care out-of-state, had zero family support in Maine, and struggled at times with drug issues of her own. Though Coleen dropped out of high school, she was intellectually gifted and artistically talented, quick to grasp complicated legal and philosophical concepts. She had near perfect facial recognition and could glance at a person and know his or her clothing sizes to a T. While Coleen was capable of great compassion and would give the shirt off her back to one less fortunate, she was also at times a con artist, thief, and liar. Though Coleen presented herself with great panache among friends, she could be painfully shy and insecure in what many would consider “normal society.” Apart from her drug addictions – or more likely much of the reason for them – Coleen suffered from serious borderline personality disorder. Unless you knew her well over a good length of time, you would not know. Beset by affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood, an unstable sense of self, impulsivity, and a pattern of intense but unstable interpersonal relations, Coleen flashed amazing smiles, but lived an inner life where she often felt intense emptiness, loneliness, and depression. By the time she was 18, Coleen was injecting opiates, crack, and various forms of amphetamines, while also abusing alcohol and other drugs. Coleen met her one and only husband and the only consistent male figure in her life (other than an older half-brother) when she was 22 and she had just started what turned out to be her longest, most successful time in recovery. The marriage was very brief, a couple years into Coleen’s recovery, but they remained dear friends until the day she died. For nearly four years Coleen was in methadone clinics and dedicated herself to sobriety. Taking to heart the adage that “without drugs, anything is possible,” and with the sometimes slavish devotion of the man she briefly married, Coleen earned her driver’s license, went to the gym regularly, completed nail tech school, worked successfully both part time in retail sales and full time caring for disabled adults, and enrolled in community college. But in the end Coleen’s untreated personality disorder and addictions prevailed. In later years, after LePage removed poor adults from MaineCare, Coleen could not afford the methadone clinic. Heroin was the cheapest way to avoid going into withdrawal. For readers without loved ones who are opiate addicts, you cannot imagine how powerful and difficult is that disease. The author of this obituary, who grew up comfortably removed from such things, thought he was educated but had no idea. Addicts shoot up to avoid being deathly ill and because the disease heightens also the psychological desire for the drug and the needle. Real addicts rarely manage to get high they just scratch and claw everyday to avoid dope sickness. Coleen wanted to get back into a methadone clinic, but LePage and enough republicans in the Legislature said “No” to the Medicaid expansion. It is no stretch to say that but for LePage’s veto of the Medicaid expansion, Coleen probably would not have shot the heroin that ended her life, and probably would not have had the serious recurring infections that ravaged her limbs the last couple years. That is not to say Coleen would be living happily ever after, since there were other significant problems. While in recovery, Coleen travelled extensively and did many wonderful things. She was particularly fond of an avant-garde theater in Washington, D.C. called the Woolly Mammoth. Coleen loved to pick flowers, shop for jeans, dance, work with crafts, and drink medium ice coffees with eight creams and eight equals (formerly eight creams, eight skim, and eight equals, until she started drinking “more coffee”). Coleen is survived by her dedicated mother, her very saddened older half-brother, a few women with whom at various times she maintained special relationships, numerous boyfriends who seemed to come and go, one boyfriend in particular named Les who among them was more special to her than the others, a few other older men along the way who genuinely tried to care for her, 100’s of acquaintances in this area, her adorable Chihuahua named Squeak, and the author of this obituary whose life was made more difficult, but also much better for having known her.\n",

I want to remind folks that if you drink or take some Benzos, then do your opioids, an overdose may not be instant. All these can compound on each other depending on metabolism and route of administration to cause an overdose later in the game. It’s pretty common among us to take a drink or maybe take a Xanax to take the edge of when sick THEN get our goods and be complacent or even get in a Benzo fog and not realize how much we are taking. Everyone is getting the dangers of fentanyl in the drug supply but we seem to forget that mixing is the number two cause of OD death. Just wanted to raise some awareness \n",

There are some Apple Rings next to the bed. That was my favorite cereal. We used to cuddle in this bed. Some of our books are on the floor. He died of an overdose many years ago. He was hiding his use. he had been drinking and snuck off to the bathroom. He died there. He had recently been released from jail. Using after abstinence, Mixing, using alone, using in an unfamiliar place are all risk factors for overdose. I have also ODed. I had a friend there who did CPR and saved my life. I am clean now. I left this room behind. I left this life behind. As much as humanly possible, I tried to use safely.  Any opiate user could end up being me or end up like him. Please use safely.

She explained that tar, by nature, is going to take longer to push through the syringe. The ECP folk are at even higher risk because how quickly they are injecting, flooding the receptors.

      "Governor Christie Allows New Jersey EMT’s To Carry Narcan To Prevent Overdoses\n",
      "\n",
      "Overdose Prevention Act\n",
      "\n",
      "Heroin overdose has become such a growing problem in New Jersey that the Governor has asked EMTs to complete a training course in order to save lives from drug poisoning. Governor Chris Christie wanted to offer EMTs the option of using the drug Narcan, a medication that can reverse the effects of a heroin overdose, in order to reduce the number of deaths related to this issue. The Christie administration needed to create a waiver allowing EMTs to use the drug and receive training since it was not covered by state EMT rules. The action was prompted by an epidemic of deaths caused by heroin overdoses in the state of New Jersey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heroin Overdose Crisis in New Jersey\n",
      "The Governor of New Jersey was concerned about the level of heroin abuse in his state after drug-related deaths rose from 1,026 in 2011 to 1,294 in 2012. The increase in heroin overdoses is something that Christie hopes to bring down with the help of first-responders equipped with Narcan. The Attorney General’s Office and the Department of Health and Human Services are working with the Ocean County Prosecutor’s office to provide the medication. An emergency overdose situation can be turned around with the ability to use this drug to reverse the effects of excessive heroin consumption. For first responders to be able to carry and administer this type of medication can mean the difference between life and death for people dealing with dangerous heroin addictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protection to Use Life-Saving Medication\n",
      "The amount of heroin overdose deaths in New Jersey was an issue especially in Ocean County where they more than doubled within only a year. In 2012 there were reportedly 53 drug overdose deaths followed by a record-breaking 112 overdose deaths most of which were caused by opioids or heroin. After this dramatic increase in overdose deaths, Christie signed into law the Overdose Prevention Act which protects those administering the drug Narcan such as healthcare professionals or pharmacists from any civil, criminal or professional liability. After signing the law, the recent waiver was necessary in order to include EMTs to be protected from liability as well. With EMTs protected by law and properly trained in using Narcan it will be possible for them to save more lives as they are responding to overdose situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Up until Governor Christie’s recent actions, EMTs in the state of New Jersey were not allowed to carry or administer Narcan according to the Department of Health’s regulations. The department opted to approve a training course for EMTs to complete in order to allow them access to use the drug on overdose victims. The drug Narcan is also called Naloxone in its generic form and is usually administered through a nasal spray. It works to reverse the effects of opoid overdose by blocking opoids from attaching to opoid receptors in the brain. The medication can be effective at preventing overdose but it depends on how much of the drug the person used and how quickly their body can process the drug. Administering the drug however, can dramatically increase the chance that victims can survive an overdose if EMTs respond quickly and effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since drug overdoses related to heroin use have reached an all-time high in New Jersey, the new law protecting EMTs and allowing them to use life-saving medications was an important decision for the Governor of the state. The goal of the law is to curb the epidemic of overdose deaths and give heroin addicts a second chance at life. The ability of EMTs to use the drug is expected to have a big impact on the growing crisis.\n",

      "Hi, My name is Nick and I work at a needle exchange in NYC (http://cornerproject.org/). I've developed a survey for people who inject drugs as a way of building a case for expanding syringe access to include providing safer injecting supplies via mail, free of charge. As you all probably know, Tracey has been doing a fine job sending people supplies but her reach is very limited due to the lack of funding for such a thing. I'm trying my best to change that. I'm originally from Australia where injecting supplies are free and very accessible. It blows my mind reading people's stories about having to buy syringes, or having to travel hours to a needle exchange (if your state even has one). Ideally, i'd like to set up an online needle exchange where people can place orders discreetly and receive what they need free of charge. We're a long way from that happening but we've gotta start somewhere. The survey only takes a few minutes to fill out and asks questions about how you get your injecting supplies, what drugs you use, if you re-use needles etc. It would be great if the injectors on this sub (USA only) could take the time to fill it out. Please hit me up if you have any questions. Thanks, Nick. https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YTmk5y8j5qGSTz5zdf4Zaf4sUoOZoB9LiBTbKeiFHjc/viewform?c=0&w=1\n",

      "\"Hi Tracey ,\n",
      "I am an Anaesthesiologist in another country who has almost unlimited access to high purity opioids and fell into the pit of addiction to Meperidene then Alfentanil . That was seventeen years ago and apart from one month relapse eleven years ago, have been clean of that slavery. I reported myself to my Professional Body and for a year sent weekly urine for opiate testing to prove to the slanderers that was clean (my own idea) . I gave a lecture on chemical dependency to my clolleagues and have built a new life to put defences in place against relapse (I dont get cravings despite daily availability). I just do not want to become a slave to this substance ever again. After turning my car over and nearly overdosing, I learnt the lesson that any drug does not give you pleasure without demanding back that pleasure in opposite terms. You pay in so many ways for what you do not to mention your family and self respect being the biggest casualties lasting years. I work as a Doctor with different and more humble insights in what we use to relieve pain. I have watched at least four colleagues overdose and die from opiate abuse - it is a real and ongoing problem shrouded in secrecy and denial.The best defence is to as you have come out in the open and be totally truthful about the mistake and its often fatal consequences.The path to health must involve stronger alternatives to opiates that will make the latter choice to be far less attractive ...like strong friendships/family bonds , regular exercise further education and so forth. \n",
      "In your documentary what I noticed that there was little evidence of antiseptic skin preparation. That must lead to skin abscesses, loss of veins not to mention systemic problems like lung and heart valve infections.Even after my ruthless self exposure and abstinence, there are colleagues who will tell me that I have a 10 percent chance of recovery as recently as this year. As a former feedback person said, there are some people who will always be prejudiced and cruel. My two children both have stable good jobs with decent education and my wife has always been supportive. Looking around , Drug addiction is just one form of a spectrum of addictions. Some are addicted to sex, sport, money and even violence. That does'nt make Drug addiction any better as a choice as most of your contributors have said. Society will accept cigarette (Nicotine) addiction but in reality, hard core users go through withdrawal on abstinence apart from the damage they do to their health. Yet many will rant against harder substance abusers as if they are any better on the self destruction scale.\"\n",

In Cincinnati at the time, there was no heroin just pills so people had to drive to NY to get it. Also, no access to rigs. I literally had the same one for about a year. In fact, I wrote a story about how bad that shit hurt. I came to SF and it was on. I could not believe there was a place to cop and needle exchange. Seriously like what the fuck. I thought it was heaven here.\n",

      "I got started on drugs at 17. I smoked pot and drank a few times when I was much younger but I was mostly straight laced. I got my wisdom teeth pulled at 17. I loved that feeling. I already had an addictive personality (food, cutting, fantasy). I didn't have much access to opiates for awhile and went to school. When I was 19 the dude I was living with hit me. I found out when I left he had been fucking my best friend as well. I went into a spiral of depression. Booze and opiates made great companions. \n",

      "Updated the post with some drug safety tips!\n",
      "Hello Redditors!\n",
      "Currently, I am working at Project Weber, an incredible organization which is devoted to harm reduction, and improving the lives of those who need a helping hand. Below I posted a short history of what Project Weber/Renew are all about. Essentially, we are a non-profit harm reduction agency for male, female, and trans sex workers.\n",
      "History Project Weber was founded in 2008 as a harm-reduction organization for street-based male sex workers (MSW) in Rhode Island. The organization provides many services, confidentially and free of charge, including: rapid HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing, condoms and safer sex materials, syringe exchange and injection kit disposal, overdose reversal medications (Narcan/Naloxone), in-house and street-based peer-led support and outreach, risk-reduction counseling, and supported referrals. PW services are delivered primarily by peer workers – former sex workers who are keenly aware of the distinct psychosocial needs of MSW. Through this peer-driven model, PW has established trusting relationships with a large group of MSW in the greater Providence area. These experiences give the organization unique access to the target population and facilitate their utilization of the services provided.\n",
      "Project RENEW was founded in 2006 with the goal to work collaboratively to provide services for women engaged in, or at risk for, commercial sex work or human trafficking in Rhode Island, with a focus on Providence, Pawtucket, and Central Falls. The primary focus of the organization is peer-led street outreach, intensive case management, HIV and HCV prevention and testing, basic needs services, and referrals. The clients are referred to partner agencies that provide services as diverse as detox, substance abuse treatment, mental and physical healthcare, housing, legal aid, and job training and employment. Project RENEW also works to advocate for increased resources for at-risk women, and serves as an information “portal” for those researching commercial sex work.\n",
      "In 2016, Project Weber and Project RENEW merged in order to combine their efforts to serve a range of high-risk men and women, including transgender persons. Prior to merging, the two programs mirrored each other in many of their respective programs including HIV prevention and testing services as well as basic needs and referrals delivered through a peer street outreach model. This merger will position the new organization as one of the few agencies in the nation dedicated to serving a diverse population of sex workers. It is our hope that the merging of these two projects at the forefront of harm reduction work will facilitate information sharing among staff and peer workers to promote best practices across sex worker populations. We further anticipate that this merger will enable the new organization to secure additional funding focused on this broader, more inclusive population, including the transgender population, which had previously been underserved in Rhode Island.\n",
      "Drug Safety Drug safety is an incredibly important issue to Weber/Renew. Often times, users may not know all the precautionary steps that they can take in order to better their experience, and reduce risk. Firstly, IV usage must be addressed. Using clean needles, and using NEW needles is imperative in reducing harm. While needles may look sharp after a few uses, they actually can become blunt after as little as one use, depending on the gauge of the needle. As the needle becomes more blunt, the odds of it tearing through tissue, and leaving pathways for pathogens to enter your body increase, which puts the user at great risk. Although cleanliness of needles is often touched upon, reusing needles is an issue which definitely deserves some more coverage. An excellent resource for IV usage can be found here.\n",
      "Another piece of information that is commonly overlooked is the fact that crack pipes, which are often not the best quality glass, can transmit diseases such as HIV/AIDS. This doesn’t occur simply because of the transfer of saliva, but instead it occurs because as the glass pipe is heated, it can cause sores and lesions in the user’s mouth, which can then be a pathway for transmitting disease. An extremely simple solution to this is to use an adaptor which doesn’t get extremely warm on the stem of the pipe. This can be something as simple as some vinyl tubing, or it can be a dedicated mouthpiece that you have purchased.\n",
      "As far as other, more well-known pieces of advice go, it is essential that if you are an opiate user, you also have some Narcan/Nalaxone on hand. This stuff can truly work wonders, and now it is being offered over the counter in many states, it may be expensive in some states, but your life is worth more! Another thing that is touched upon to frequently is the testing of heroin. Other drugs have the luxury of receiving publicity about the various reagents that are used to identify them, however, heroin is often overlooked in this regard. A testing reagent can be found here. The reagent is used to detect acetyl-fentanyl in your heroin. Again, it does cost money but your life is worth more.\n",

I can't guarantee anything. I have asked /u/nickwhcp to fill in during my hiatus. He has graciously agreed. He can fill all your (reasonable) care package needs for basics like syringes and naloxone. I do around 10 or less a week so I assume he can do the same. Thank you so much NICK!!!\n",

We had some good times baby but i got to quit you. I have a good life- married with three kids. I can't have an affair on my life and expect no consequences. If i mess with my past, I am cheating my future. \n",

      "This is probably $20 in todays dollars. The dope dealers used to sell $5 pieces back then. Plus, we didn't say killed, just stabbed. True story- I've seen dope dealers ask clients to whip someone's ass on the dope track. They complied without hesitation thinking they would get paid. Desperate ppl will do a lot of crazy shit. I've been robbed at knifepoint over less than $50 of dope. \n",
