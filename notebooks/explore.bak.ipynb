Thanks to you guys, I received a lot of replies and I bought a $10 scale from Amazon that was delivered the other day.\\n\\nOn NYE (today), dBoy was in my area at the clinic and he stopped by my house for a NYE drink (for once he brought his own Mickeys). I bought a half from him and only then I broke-out my new scale. I put dBoy's half on my scale and it registered 0.50 g, which is light considering the ziploc bag's weight. dBoy said \"Your scale is wrong. I know my shit is right\".  I asked him to Google the weight of a quarter, I hit my coin jar and I put a quarter on my new scale. Lo and behold, my scale registers 0.57 g, while the internet said that a quarter = 0.567 g ([https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f)), which is good enough for government work.\\n\\nI'm like \"what's up with that?\" and dBoy starts stammering and stuttering because he knows that he was WRONG ALL ALONG and I just caught him red-handed. dBoy takes his half back and adds to it until it registers 0.6 g with the bag, which is OK (but not cool, I mean, never-mind the rip-offs for the last two years).\\n\\nSo it's time for him to go and dBoy asks if he can buy my $10 scale for a dub, since he needs a new one. Now, it sounded like a great deal at the time because I only paid $8.78 taxed and shipped from Amazon.\\n\\n After dBoy left, I started to think about it. Maybe dBoy got me again! Here's my question to all my r/opiates bros and gals: Did dBoy buy my scale because he needed a new one OR did he buy my scale because he wanted to get that scale out of my hands so that I couldn't check him?

It's a kinda a sad story, but here it is for your enjoyment - or NOT.\\n\\nA long time ago there were two beautiful little girls, Angelique and Dominique. Angelique had long jet black hair while her sister Dominque had long blonde hair. They were both so cute and happy and playful. On Christmas Eve, Mom and Dad put all of their gifts under the Christmas tree. There were tons of gifts, not only from Mom and Dad, but also from Grandmom and Granddad and Uncles and Aunts and Cousins and family friends. There were baby dolls and Barbie dolls, coloring books and crayons and games. And there were clothes, beautiful clothes for little girls. It was going to be a perfect Christmas!\\n\\nChristmas Eve bedtime came and Angelique and Dominique said their prayers and snuggled into bed. They were so excited that they could hardly sleep. They literally could not wait for Christmas morning. It would be so wonderful! But sleep they did. \\n\\nDuring the night, a dark spirit came upon Mom and Dad. To some it was a demon; to others it was just a drug. It looked so harmless. It wasn't a gun or a knife. It was just a tiny piece of white. It had many names: base, hard, ready rock - you can Google them all, but most people just call it CRACK.\\n\\nSo Crack came that Christmas Eve and slowly one by one, the beautifully wrapped Christmas gifts disappeared. First the baby dolls - Angelique and Dominque were too old for them anyway. Then the Barbie dolls - hell they were sexist. And so Angelique and Dominique's Christmas gifts were taken by Crack until finally the gifts were no more.\\n\\nAs it has for billions of years, the earth turned and the sun rose and morning came. Angelique and Dominique jumped out of bed! They ran downstairs - their little hearts beating 160 and their tiny feet moving as fast as they could go. But something was wrong, very, very wrong. Where were the beautiful Christmas gifts? Perhaps it was a joke and Mom and Dad hid the gifts? But no, there were no Christmas gifts anywhere and like the dawn, it dawned on the the girls. As it had with the food stamps and the rent money and the new school clothes from Grandmom, Crack had taken them all. Angelique and Dominique didn't even cry. These two wonderful little girls had become hard, harder than diamonds. They could not be hurt anymore and that was the worse thing of all.\\n\\nThis is a true story, but, yes, I did take artistic license to embellish it some. I changed the names to protect the innocent and the guilty, or maybe I didn't. I hope your liked my cake day story.</td>\n",

Our use escalated to Mondays and Fridays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, well you know the rest.  I could not keep pace with her because I didn't have the funds, but otherwise I'd be right with her.\\n\\nStaying up all night, not eating, not pooping and not hydrating began to take it's toll.  Her silky, long, auburn hair was stringy and unwashed.  Her clothes went from Nordstrom to Goodwill. Her car was always in need of routine maintenance and she went from car dealers to backyard mechanics.  Still, nothing that she couldn't recover from.\\n\\nShe started \"dating\" men, drug dealers, who she'd not give a second look before. She ran through a series of two month \"relationships\" with these guys.  It seems that after they got what they wanted, these men had no more use for her. Fortunately, she was not diseased by these \"affairs\". Also, she pawned her things and then began to borrow and steal from family and friends.\\n\\nThe end came when she developed a deviated septum caused by the coke eating away at her nose. She had good insurance through her parents and the surgeons were able to fix her deviated septum.  All she had to do was to let the surgery heal, i.e. stay away from cocaine for a couple weeks. She could not stay away and the surgery failed, nearly causing permanent damage to her nose. Her doctors knew that she needed help and she accepted the chance to go to rehab.\\n\\nShe's married with kids and happy and healthy now.  Take care.</td>\n",

I live in Virginia and I read the applicable chapter in the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (VRLTA).  It was pretty straightforward, but I have questions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI read that the landlord must provide *24 hour written notice* stating the people, the date and the time.  My landlord NEVER did this. People just entered using the lockbox on the door.  Is this legal?  Can I tell the people to get out? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n The VRLTA said that access should be only during *reasonable* times.  My question is what is reasonable?  To me, 9:00 am Monday morning is reasonable, but 9:00 am Sunday morning is NOT.  I was butterball naked the other day and people just walked in.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am concerned about people stealing.  In my work, I prove bonds so that the customer is protected.

So Lep is now back in the Game. \\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Lep signed his car title over to Robert, who was his partner, so that he could sell it and put the money in Leprechaun's commissary account.\\n\\nWhen he was arrested, everyone thought that that was all for Lep. He had a long rap sheet and had spent 20+ years in prison. No one, including Robert, imagined that Lep would be out in less than five years. So Robbing Robert just kept ALL the money from selling Leprechaun's car.\\n\\nWhen he was released last month, Leprechaun tried to reason with Robert about his money. Obviously, Lep didn't need any more trouble, but Robert being the smart ass thief that he is, told Lep to fuck-off.  On the street, it's one thing to steal, but it's another thing entirely to humiliate a man. \\n\\nLep is about the most violent man that I have ever known. He stabbed a man in the throat over a girl. He hit a man with a brick multiple times in the head because he would not let Lep crash at his crib one winter night when Lep was outdoors. .  But the worse was when Lep hit a tiny girl - a 5 foot 98 pound babygirl - repeatedly with a wine bottle because her husband was getting out of jail and she told Lep that she would not be seeing him anymore. HELL, Lep survived over 20 years in prison so he had to be hard.\\n\\nWord is that Lep is running the streets telling everyone that he is going to stab Robert. Robert  is supposedly hiding out at his first wife's place until he can get some money and Lep cools down. \\n\\nSo will Lep really stab Robert or at least beat him up or will Robert wiggle out of this one too?

If they are really good, they obviously perform better than someone who commands a lower salary. If they aren't, they are seen as a loss. But the correlation suggests that the scouting department pretty much knows their job. \\n\\nRemember, this is an imperfect competition. You will have some variations in a hypothetical quality vs wage list graph as opposed to the norm of 100% correlation. But it is more or less, well relatable.\\n\\nI agree the point of the managers being irrelevant is oversimplified. I can give you cases. Jurgen Klinsmann was a bad manager, according to Philip Lahm, and the players realized it early enough. But my point is, the role of the manager is pretty much well-defined, which accounts for the apparent irrelevance of the role. That's what I said above. There's a brilliant example for this. Sir Alex, he's hardly changed his style over two decades, his teams play in the same fashion over the years. He had to perform a 'revolution' when changing to a diamond formation. You really think this field requires innovation?\\n\\nThe Art of Management in my opinion, has become a well-established 'constant' profession. You may even be able to list down the different styles, and managers who come under that. In terms of similarity, Moyes and Ferguson come first to my mind. Jose M, Jurgen Klopp seem very similar. Roberto Martinez, Michael Laudrup. Tony Pulis, Sam Allardyce. In fact, I think Kuper hit upon a gem when he said Pulis was much better than the norm. We all know that intuitively, I think.\\n\\nI think generally, you can relate the apparent irrelevance of a person in a job to the job being pretty much well-defined. But yeah, he does come to a wrong conclusion when belittling the role of the manager.</td>\n",

Say they might play their youth players to gain experience. They would follow their own plans. They have a lot at stake. Remember, they have to care about their own fans too. Their fans should understand what the team is trying to do to benefit themselves. It's like real life. Clubs are very much like people. They try to take the best decision for themselves. If they deliberately lose on a whim, they'll lose their fans who certainly aren't stupid. The club isn't stupid. I'm 100% sure Swansea won't intentionally play poorly, unless they've been paid to lose.\\n\\nImagine this as a whole system of people. There might also be the possibility that Swansea may have to think of their future relations with City or United. There are a lot of things at stake. It's real life. I don't understand why this can't make football a lot more interesting or egalitarian.

How the hell does a dose of money for the smaller club harm these intentions.\\n\\nThe only thing that can happen is that the team at the receiving end (possibly a 'bigger' club) will be at harm. But the point is that this team also has equal opportunity as the other 'bigger' club giving money of 'manipulating' a game.\\n\\nIf the supporters don't understand that, they're living in a bubble. Anyway, the fact that they are supporters probably makes them irrational.\\n\\nIt's life. It's not manipulation. Listen. If the richer club pays a poorer club to beat another richer club, I just cannot understand how the league becomes less competitive. The poorer clubs only gain monetarily, while one or more of the richer clubs lose monetarily. IF anything, it will increase competition.\\n\\nThe financial incentive situation is identical to England offering a bonus to their players if they win. This is also a situation of real life influencing the footballing world unfairly. You seem to be suggesting the players do not necessarily play to win for their national side, if you sanction the need for bonuses. 'Unsporting'? You tell me.\\n\\nSorry for the anger.

Sublingual ROA is for a lot of the drug to seep in through your handy dandy capillaries under your tongue. Fortunately, this happens quickly and also as long as you don't swallow the entire pill, swallowing some saliva with a little bit of the sub in it isn't going to waste it or fuck anything up. The biggest thing to know about subs is precipitated withdrawal! Basically, wait like at least 24 hours after taking dope to take suboxone or else you'll have immediate, really intense WD symptoms. Good rule of thumb is to only take subs after taking dope if you're definitely dope sick, then you should be right as rain. Another thing is that suboxone's dosing, to some extent, is non linear. Meaning, if you're trying to get fucked up on suboxone, just continually taking more suboxone is not gonna do it usually, also in my experience firsthand and also from speaking to people who have used subs before, subs will make you feel kinda high when you first start out taking them and then not at all again, no matter how much you change your dose. anyway, if you have any questions let me know.

Any comments are appreciated, thank you\\n\\n//Artifact (18)\\n \\n1 Azorius Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Chromatic Lantern \\n\\n\\n1 Crucible of Worlds \\n\\n\\n1 Cursed Totem \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Keyrune \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Gilded Lotus \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Crypt \\n\\n\\n1 Mox Diamond \\n\\n\\n1 Nihil Spellbomb \\n\\n\\n1 Orzhov Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Sensei's Divining Top \\n\\n\\n1 Sol Ring \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Dominance \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Progress \\n\\n\\n1 Torpor Orb \\n\\n\\n1 Trinisphere \\n\\n\\n1 Uba Mask \\n\\n\\n//Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Sun Titan \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment (19) \\n\\n\\n1 Aura of Silence \\n\\n\\n1 Back to Basics \\n\\n\\n1 Ghostly Prison \\n\\n\\n1 Greater Auramancy \\n\\n\\n1 Humility \\n\\n\\n1 In the Eye of Chaos \\n\\n\\n1 Karmic Justice \\n\\n\\n1 Land Equilibrium \\n\\n\\n1 Land Tax \\n\\n\\n1 Leyline of the Void \\n\\n\\n1 Luminarch Ascension \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Breach \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Vortex \\n\\n\\n1 Monastery Siege \\n\\n\\n1 Mystic Remora \\n\\n\\n1 Phyrexian Arena \\n\\n\\n1 Propaganda \\n\\n\\n1 Rhystic Study \\n\\n\\n1 Sphere of Safety \\n\\n\\n//Instant (7)\\n\\n\\n1 Anguished Unmaking \\n\\n\\n1 Cyclonic Rift \\n\\n\\n1 Enlightened Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Lim-Dul's Vault \\n\\n\\n1 Path to Exile \\n\\n\\n1 Swords to Plowshares \\n\\n\\n1 Vampiric Tutor \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Erebos, God of the Dead \\n\\n\\n//Planeswalker (4) \\n\\n\\n1 Elspeth, Knight-Errant \\n\\n\\n1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor \\n\\n\\n1 Liliana of the Veil \\n\\n\\n1 Tezzeret the Seeker \\n\\n\\n//Sorcery (12) \\n\\n\\n1 Armageddon \\n\\n\\n1 Cataclysm \\n\\n\\n1 Catastrophe \\n\\n\\n1 Damnation \\n\\n\\n1 Demonic Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Merciless Eviction \\n\\n\\n1 Open the Vaults \\n\\n\\n1 Ravages of War \\n\\n\\n1 Replenish \\n\\n\\n1 Supreme Verdict \\n\\n\\n1 Toxic Deluge \\n\\n\\n1 Vindicate \\n\\n\\n//Land (37) \\n\\n\\n1 Academy Ruins \\n\\n\\n1 Ancient Tomb \\n\\n\\n1 Bojuka Bog \\n\\n\\n1 Cabal Coffers \\n\\n\\n1 Command Tower \\n\\n\\n1 Creeping Tar Pit \\n\\n\\n1 Flagstones of Trokair \\n\\n\\n1 Flooded Strand \\n\\n\\n1 Geier Reach Sanitarium \\n\\n\\n1 Godless Shrine \\n\\n\\n1 Hallowed Fountain \\n\\n\\n7 Island 1 Kor Haven \\n\\n\\n1 Marsh Flats \\n\\n\\n1 Maze of Ith \\n\\n\\n5 Plains \\n\\n\\n1 Polluted Delta \\n\\n\\n1 Reflecting Pool \\n\\n\\n1 Serra's Sanctum \\n\\n\\n1 Strip Mine \\n\\n\\n5 Swamp \\n\\n\\n1 Tolaria West \\n\\n\\n1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth \\n\\n\\n(((https://www.mtgvault.com/mibs80/decks/oloro-stax/ )))</td>\n",

I think it's a fairly expansive group with a lot of people and my games are almost never over in the first few turns.

       "      <td>Your interest in in Green and Black, reanimation, as well as looking for a mid-range casual to eventual cEDH deck makes me believe that Karador would be a good choice for you. In a more casual meta, the removal of white is very good, and when 3 of your opponents are playing some variant of \"land ramp into fatties\" or \"turn creatures sideways\" the spot removal and more budget friendly board wipes of white will also in my opinion earn you more mileage over the counterspells in blue. Especially since some of the best counterspells (FoW, Flusterstorm, Pact of Negation) aren't as good in casual metas as they are in comp. Metas because they're bad tempo plays that are only good for protecting/stopping in a game winning  scenario (plus they're kind of expensive, especially since in a deck like yours where if you want to run Jin Gitaxas and other massive reanimate targets it'd likely be a priority to get yourself a Mana drain). The other reason I think that Karador is good for budget is because you don't need the good artifact ramp. Kodamas reach, nature's lore, and a suite of dorks will get you just as far for a whole lot less money. And finally, the ability to tune Karador to your meta is a lot higher than in other decks. You can simply switch around reanimation targets. For example, you could play the abzan praetors and Iona, and then add combos like Mike/trike, karmic guide, and maybe even Bomberman or boonweaver over time and to your meta. Good luck with your search!</td>\n",

They player with the most stages in the correct order without dupes wins. For example, if the game was to drive your automobile to the liquor store, the stages would be\\n\\n1. Get in automobile\\n2. Check gas\\n3. Adjust seat\\n4. Adjust mirrors\\n5. Set radio\\n6. Insert key\\n7. Turn key\\n8. etc., etc., etc\\n9. ....\\n\\nFor **The Stages of WDs**, the first three stages MIGHT be (this is just an example and is not correct)\\n\\n1. Runny nose\\n2. Puking\\n3.

       "10      Junky Jesus is real! I was down to my last $5 and it was only Wednesday. DAMN! Why did I pay my stupid bills?  I have two pillows, but I only use one. I decided to switch up tonight and use my other pillow. I laid down my head, worrying about getting sick, but something felt weird in my pillow. Could it be? YES! I found $120 hidden in the pillow case. HALLELUJAH! JJ IS REAL!

       "29      This Chomo will likely get 3 years and get out in 18 months, but you get caught with a dub or a 30 and its 5 years. In fact, Chomo may not get **anytime at all** because the kids are too young to testify and therefore there are no witnesses to the crime. And they call that Justice in America. At least the dad got in some pretty good licks in judging by Chomo's face.

       "30      I'm watching Locked Up Abroad on National Geographic channel. I can't believe how foolish these people are smuggling H from Bangkok for some Nigerian guy.

       "32      I thought that dBoy's bags were light, so I asked for advice on r/opiates about a cheap scale. Thanks to you guys, I received a lot of replies and I bought a $10 scale from Amazon that was delivered the other day.\\n\\nOn NYE (today), dBoy was in my area at the clinic and he stopped by my house for a NYE drink (for once he brought his own Mickeys). I bought a half from him and only then I broke-out my new scale. I put dBoy's half on my scale and it registered 0.50 g, which is light considering the ziploc bag's weight. dBoy said \"Your scale is wrong. I know my shit is right\".  I asked him to Google the weight of a quarter, I hit my coin jar and I put a quarter on my new scale. Lo and behold, my scale registers 0.57 g, while the internet said that a quarter = 0.567 g ([https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f)), which is good enough for government work.\\n\\nI'm like \"what's up with that?\" and dBoy starts stammering and stuttering because he knows that he was WRONG ALL ALONG and I just caught him red-handed. dBoy takes his half back and adds to it until it registers 0.6 g with the bag, which is OK (but not cool, I mean, never-mind the rip-offs for the last two years).\\n\\nSo it's time for him to go and dBoy asks if he can buy my $10 scale for a dub, since he needs a new one. Now, it sounded like a great deal at the time because I only paid $8.78 taxed and shipped from Amazon.\\n\\n After dBoy left, I started to think about it. Maybe dBoy got me again! Here's my question to all my r/opiates bros and gals: Did dBoy buy my scale because he needed a new one OR did he buy my scale because he wanted to get that scale out of my hands so that I couldn't check him?  What do you guys think?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "33      I wanted to post something special on my cake day. It's a kinda a sad story, but here it is for your enjoyment - or NOT.\\n\\nA long time ago there were two beautiful little girls, Angelique and Dominique. Angelique had long jet black hair while her sister Dominque had long blonde hair. They were both so cute and happy and playful. On Christmas Eve, Mom and Dad put all of their gifts under the Christmas tree. There were tons of gifts, not only from Mom and Dad, but also from Grandmom and Granddad and Uncles and Aunts and Cousins and family friends. There were baby dolls and Barbie dolls, coloring books and crayons and games. And there were clothes, beautiful clothes for little girls. It was going to be a perfect Christmas!\\n\\nChristmas Eve bedtime came and Angelique and Dominique said their prayers and snuggled into bed. They were so excited that they could hardly sleep. They literally could not wait for Christmas morning. It would be so wonderful! But sleep they did. \\n\\nDuring the night, a dark spirit came upon Mom and Dad. To some it was a demon; to others it was just a drug. It looked so harmless. It wasn't a gun or a knife. It was just a tiny piece of white. It had many names: base, hard, ready rock - you can Google them all, but most people just call it CRACK.\\n\\nSo Crack came that Christmas Eve and slowly one by one, the beautifully wrapped Christmas gifts disappeared. First the baby dolls - Angelique and Dominque were too old for them anyway. Then the Barbie dolls - hell they were sexist. And so Angelique and Dominique's Christmas gifts were taken by Crack until finally the gifts were no more.\\n\\nAs it has for billions of years, the earth turned and the sun rose and morning came. Angelique and Dominique jumped out of bed! They ran downstairs - their little hearts beating 160 and their tiny feet moving as fast as they could go. But something was wrong, very, very wrong. Where were the beautiful Christmas gifts? Perhaps it was a joke and Mom and Dad hid the gifts? But no, there were no Christmas gifts anywhere and like the dawn, it dawned on the the girls. As it had with the food stamps and the rent money and the new school clothes from Grandmom, Crack had taken them all. Angelique and Dominique didn't even cry. These two wonderful little girls had become hard, harder than diamonds. They could not be hurt anymore and that was the worse thing of all.\\n\\nThis is a true story, but, yes, I did take artistic license to embellish it some. I changed the names to protect the innocent and the guilty, or maybe I didn't. I hope your liked my cake day story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I really think you guys and girls can give me good advice because of your unique experiences. \\n\\r\\nI know a guy who is wanted by the US MARSHALLS FOR VIOLENT RAPE. Specifically, he raped a little boy - a tiny, little, defenseless five-year old boy. Before you jump on me, I don't know where this guy lives but I do know a guy who does know where he lives or at least sleeps.\\r\\nObviously, I don’t want the cops poking around my apartment. On the other hand, I really want this child rapist brought to justice, as I am sure that you all do. On the third hand, I hate SNITCHES.

       "55      I started anew job on October 3. I was fucking up like calling in when I was dope sick and being slow in general. So they finally they let me go. It wasn't because of misconduct. I was always one time,. I was just slow (guess why). The job just wasn't working out for me. So, the HR people called me in and I was ready for the bad news.\\n a\\nI was wanted to fight for 4 weeks notice from HR instead of the regular 2 weeks. Again, I wasn't charged with misconduct. I was just slow. They didn't really have anything concrete against me.\\n\\nSo again, I go into the HR office ready to fight.

       "74      &#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a story of a young, beautiful girl who was hurt, but not destroyed, by cocaine. I am NOT preaching, because the fact is that I was right behind her.\\n\\nIn the beginning, it was nice, may be once or twice a month.  Our use escalated to Mondays and Fridays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, well you know the rest.  I could not keep pace with her because I didn't have the funds, but otherwise I'd be right with her.\\n\\nStaying up all night, not eating, not pooping and not hydrating began to take it's toll.  Her silky, long, auburn hair was stringy and unwashed.  Her clothes went from Nordstrom to Goodwill. Her car was always in need of routine maintenance and she went from car dealers to backyard mechanics.  Still, nothing that she couldn't recover from.\\n\\nShe started \"dating\" men, drug dealers, who she'd not give a second look before. She ran through a series of two month \"relationships\" with these guys.  It seems that after they got what they wanted, these men had no more use for her. Fortunately, she was not diseased by these \"affairs\". Also, she pawned her things and then began to borrow and steal from family and friends.\\n\\nThe end came when she developed a deviated septum caused by the coke eating away at her nose. She had good insurance through her parents and the surgeons were able to fix her deviated septum.  All she had to do was to let the surgery heal, i.e. stay away from cocaine for a couple weeks. She could not stay away and the surgery failed, nearly causing permanent damage to her nose. Her doctors knew that she needed help and she accepted the chance to go to rehab.\\n\\nShe's married with kids and happy and healthy now.

       "89      My landlord is showing my apartment so that he can sell it at the end of my lease.  I understand that it's his property and that he has every right to sell it and that I will have to move.  My question concerns access by the realtors and prospective buyers.  I live in Virginia and I read the applicable chapter in the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (VRLTA).  It was pretty straightforward, but I have questions.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI read that the landlord must provide *24 hour written notice* stating the people, the date and the time.  My landlord NEVER did this. People just entered using the lockbox on the door.  Is this legal?  Can I tell the people to get out? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n The VRLTA said that access should be only during *reasonable* times.  My question is what is reasonable?  To me, 9:00 am Monday morning is reasonable, but 9:00 am Sunday morning is NOT.  I was butterball naked the other day and people just walked in.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am concerned about people stealing.  In my work, I prove bonds so that the customer is protected.  Can I make my landlord fully responsible if anything is stolen?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am also concerned about any retaliation from the landlord if I start asking for these lawful things.  I know that he is not renewing the lease, but he can still make my life miserable with the utilities, repairs and such.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a rhetorical question, but why are landlords allowed to make things miserable for good, hard-working Americans who always pay their rent on time?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks, METRO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "95      I thought you guys might like a story about dBoy drama and street justice. \\n\\nLeprechaun was my ex dBoy who was jailed on a distro charge, but the judge had to set him free because the testing lab was overloaded and couldn't test Leprechaun's stuff within the time limit.  So Lep is now back in the Game. \\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Lep signed his car title over to Robert, who was his partner, so that he could sell it and put the money in Leprechaun's commissary account.\\n\\nWhen he was arrested, everyone thought that that was all for Lep. He had a long rap sheet and had spent 20+ years in prison. No one, including Robert, imagined that Lep would be out in less than five years. So Robbing Robert just kept ALL the money from selling Leprechaun's car.\\n\\nWhen he was released last month, Leprechaun tried to reason with Robert about his money. Obviously, Lep didn't need any more trouble, but Robert being the smart ass thief that he is, told Lep to fuck-off.  On the street, it's one thing to steal, but it's another thing entirely to humiliate a man. \\n\\nLep is about the most violent man that I have ever known. He stabbed a man in the throat over a girl. He hit a man with a brick multiple times in the head because he would not let Lep crash at his crib one winter night when Lep was outdoors. .  But the worse was when Lep hit a tiny girl - a 5 foot 98 pound babygirl - repeatedly with a wine bottle because her husband was getting out of jail and she told Lep that she would not be seeing him anymore. HELL, Lep survived over 20 years in prison so he had to be hard.\\n\\nWord is that Lep is running the streets telling everyone that he is going to stab Robert. Robert  is supposedly hiding out at his first wife's place until he can get some money and Lep cools down. \\n\\nSo will Lep really stab Robert or at least beat him up or will Robert wiggle out of this one too?  What say you.?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "109     This post is mostly for guys, but maybe girls too (although I don't see anyone wanting to eat out Trap girls) . Traps always have girls that are looking to make money to feed their addictions. I feel kinda gross doing money-for-favors, so I usually just throw the girl a dub without any expectations. However then I FEEL like a sucker - I mean I didn't get nada. The black guys just say something like \"get away from me you filthy Ho\", but I am just NOT that type of guy. Also, they are kinda like birds, if you feed one the whole flock descends. And I feel so sorry for these poor girls. \\n\\nWho has advice for poor Metro?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Someone tell me WHY?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "159     Church Girl called me Sunday morning to tell me that we were going to the 12:30 pm Mass. I don't like attending those late Masses because I want to watch the NFL which starts at 1:00 pm.\\n\\nSo I tell Church Girl that I was sick. She kept pressing me about what exactly was wrong. Finally, I got tired of her nagging so I texted :\\n\\nThe truth is that I don't want to go to church because I am getting high.\\n\\nShe texted back :\\n\\nThere you go excuses, excuses. Your priorities are a mess- getting high instead of going to church.\\n\\nSo, now she is mad at me again, BUT I am proud because I went high when she went\\n low and texted back :\\n\\nHave a good day\\n\\nWhat a life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "191     I was told that pre-employment drug test are always sent to the lab and are impossible to beat w/o switching urine.

And worse of all they sit back and count their money while our friends and family OD. \\n\\nAren't they the REAL FIENDS - the REAL MONSTERS?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "216     Last week Church Girl called and asked me if I wanted to come over and see her new puppy.  Everyone likes new puppies so sure. So. Church Girl picks me up after work and we head over to her apt.\\n\\nShe opens the door and the puppy comes rushing out. Unfortunately, the puppy is only half house broken so her apt smelled, but that was too be expected. I didn't say anything because I didn't want her cleaning while I was visiting.\\n\\nThe puppy was an American bulldog about 8 weeks old and very cute.  I didn't know this,, but bulldogs have been so genetically engineered that they can't even mate w/o human help. The male's legs are so short that he can't mount the female on his own. That's kinda messed up, but onto my mounting.\\n\\nI was playing with the puppy and Church Girl went into her bedroom.  From the bedroom, She said to me \"It feels so good to get out of work clothes after a long day\" and she comes out in just bra and panties.  Remember, that we haven't been intimate.\\n\\nI'm trying to be Joe Cool, but damn any almost- naked woman at her peak of sexual attraction is just wonderful. So I am futilely trying to look without looking.  She goes into the kitchen and asks me if I am hungry and she'll make me some pasta or something. (What is it with Italian girls and feeding a man?).\\n\\nI was just about to make my move when she says \"I clean and cook and I know how to take care of a man. See what a good wife would be?\"  and then she brings up my GF and how I have to leave my GF for her.\\n\\nI played with the puppy a little more and said I was tired and went home,thinking \"I am such a loser. A beautiful woman just put it in my face and I couldn't lie to her and tell her that I would leave my GF for her.\"  So here I am, just another loser,, sleeping all alone.

IT WOULD BE SO GREAT, THAT I WOULD CREAM MY PANTS. \\n\\nWhat's your cop fantasy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "237     So Church Girl gets her refill of ninety 20mg Adderall.  I like to be focused and productive and so I ask her for 1 (as in O-N-E)  pill. She texts back \"you are getting to be a pain in the ass\".\\n\\nI took this girl to IHOP Saturday night and then we went clothes shopping. She wanted to buy a pair of jeans, but when we got to the checkout she was short $27. Like the fool I am and will always be, I lent her the money which she swore to repay.\\nSo at this point, I'm pissed. I write back \"KEEP YOUR STINKING DRUGS, JUST PAY ME MY MONEY\".  I feel bad about that, because she doesn't make much and she is struggling. \\n\\nYou guys told me that these Adderall are her medicine and she needs them for ADHD, but still 1 pill?

       "244     We've had a lot of shit posts lately and I want to lighten things up a bit. So here is my latest escapade with Church Girl. \\n\\nI had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. \\n\\n Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me \"where is all your money going\", but she coughed up the cash.\\n\\nNow here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?\\n\\nI played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  \"the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive\". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say \"damn girl, you're a speed addict\".\\n\\nI told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.\\n\\nNow I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!\\n\\nSo there you have it. Church Girl is a speed freak and she doesn't even know it!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "245     I have two 10 mg Adderall. I was told to eat just one pill with a strong coffee on an empty stomach before work. \\n\\nI have no stim tolerance. It's been over a year since I took any stimulants and that was only two coke lines in summer 2017.\\n\\nIs one 10mg pill effective or should I take both pills (20mg)? . Also, I will be at work and I can't be zooming.\\n\\nThanks guys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "457951  yeah, not a problem, but what's happening in America is like the birth of a social phenomenon. Just reading about the growth (and the events that perpetuated it) of soccer is a wonderful window to explore human dynamics. I think this is at the heart of soccer at every single level right from the playing field, managing side, to the boardroom and the impact on the general community. That's why you also have a lot of A-League links too. It's great, isn't it?\\n\\nI don't think this subreddit is A-centric. The quality in the American and Australian leagues are nowhere near as good as those in Europe. Obviously, you can't say we aren't watching adequate footballing action on here.

       "457979  Yeah.. but they could be duds, right? That's the point...\\nIt is more or less well done. The players who are perceived to perform best command the higher salaries. If they are really good, they obviously perform better than someone who commands a lower salary. If they aren't, they are seen as a loss. But the correlation suggests that the scouting department pretty much knows their job. \\n\\nRemember, this is an imperfect competition. You will have some variations in a hypothetical quality vs wage list graph as opposed to the norm of 100% correlation. But it is more or less, well relatable.\\n\\nI agree the point of the managers being irrelevant is oversimplified. I can give you cases. Jurgen Klinsmann was a bad manager, according to Philip Lahm, and the players realized it early enough. But my point is, the role of the manager is pretty much well-defined, which accounts for the apparent irrelevance of the role. That's what I said above. There's a brilliant example for this. Sir Alex, he's hardly changed his style over two decades, his teams play in the same fashion over the years. He had to perform a 'revolution' when changing to a diamond formation. You really think this field requires innovation?\\n\\nThe Art of Management in my opinion, has become a well-established 'constant' profession. You may even be able to list down the different styles, and managers who come under that. In terms of similarity, Moyes and Ferguson come first to my mind. Jose M, Jurgen Klopp seem very similar. Roberto Martinez, Michael Laudrup. Tony Pulis, Sam Allardyce. In fact, I think Kuper hit upon a gem when he said Pulis was much better than the norm. We all know that intuitively, I think.\\n\\nI think generally, you can relate the apparent irrelevance of a person in a job to the job being pretty much well-defined. But yeah, he does come to a wrong conclusion when belittling the role of the manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "457991  My point is in this case is why wouldn't City offer money? If they are in such a desperate situation, they would offer money.\\n\\nSwansea know they will try to win or do what they would normally do in that position. Say they might play their youth players to gain experience. They would follow their own plans. They have a lot at stake. Remember, they have to care about their own fans too. Their fans should understand what the team is trying to do to benefit themselves. It's like real life. Clubs are very much like people. They try to take the best decision for themselves. If they deliberately lose on a whim, they'll lose their fans who certainly aren't stupid. The club isn't stupid. I'm 100% sure Swansea won't intentionally play poorly, unless they've been paid to lose.\\n\\nImagine this as a whole system of people. There might also be the possibility that Swansea may have to think of their future relations with City or United. There are a lot of things at stake. It's real life. I don't understand why this can't make football a lot more interesting or egalitarian. Anyways, the smaller clubs gain if they're getting money from larger clubs. \\n\\nThe whole game would become unbelievably exciting, if you ask me, exactly like real life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "458003  What the f*** is the problem with that, I don't get it. Define 'unsporting'. Supporters? This is human nature. We want to maximize our benefit. The players want to maximize their benefit. The club wants to maximize their benefit. The supporters want to maximize their benefit. How the hell does a dose of money for the smaller club harm these intentions.\\n\\nThe only thing that can happen is that the team at the receiving end (possibly a 'bigger' club) will be at harm. But the point is that this team also has equal opportunity as the other 'bigger' club giving money of 'manipulating' a game.\\n\\nIf the supporters don't understand that, they're living in a bubble. Anyway, the fact that they are supporters probably makes them irrational.\\n\\nIt's life. It's not manipulation. Listen. If the richer club pays a poorer club to beat another richer club, I just cannot understand how the league becomes less competitive. The poorer clubs only gain monetarily, while one or more of the richer clubs lose monetarily. IF anything, it will increase competition.\\n\\nThe financial incentive situation is identical to England offering a bonus to their players if they win. This is also a situation of real life influencing the footballing world unfairly. You seem to be suggesting the players do not necessarily play to win for their national side, if you sanction the need for bonuses. 'Unsporting'? You tell me.\\n\\nSorry for the anger.

       "458005  The anger is more a result of societal jealousy against footballers, who they see as earning more than they deserve. There are absolute fools who write for the papers in the UK.

       "458058  Suboxone is nice stuff. To answer your ROA question, you can swallow that spit my guy, you don't have to let it puff out like that. Sublingual ROA is for a lot of the drug to seep in through your handy dandy capillaries under your tongue. Fortunately, this happens quickly and also as long as you don't swallow the entire pill, swallowing some saliva with a little bit of the sub in it isn't going to waste it or fuck anything up. The biggest thing to know about subs is precipitated withdrawal! Basically, wait like at least 24 hours after taking dope to take suboxone or else you'll have immediate, really intense WD symptoms. Good rule of thumb is to only take subs after taking dope if you're definitely dope sick, then you should be right as rain. Another thing is that suboxone's dosing, to some extent, is non linear. Meaning, if you're trying to get fucked up on suboxone, just continually taking more suboxone is not gonna do it usually, also in my experience firsthand and also from speaking to people who have used subs before, subs will make you feel kinda high when you first start out taking them and then not at all again, no matter how much you change your dose. anyway, if you have any questions let me know.

       "458167  Mmmmmm I'd been doing pills awhile and lost my connect. Needed a new option to stay right and dope it was. Was gonna be in an unknown city for 6 hours waiting for a bus. Copped, and couldn't wait so I did it in a major mall bathroom in a large US city just an hour before my bus was meant to arrive.

I definitely feel like the whole ritual of my drug use plays a big part in my addiction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "458343  Hey cEDH players, I have been trying to find a stax deck and I want to see some opinions/thoughts from you guys. So far I've gotten two decks in my head, cause I don't want to play green, those being Chain veil teferi and oloro, ageless ascetic. \\nI have a prospective oloro list built up that I might buy if I get it more tuned. (Forgive me if I formatted it wrong, i read FAQ/community guidelines but it didn't say how just to do it) \\nIf you guys can guide me to a nice primer or list on teferi, Id appreciate it. My meta is competitive, but I think I would rather play oloro unless teferi is just that much better because I own a lot of the cards. Any comments are appreciated, thank you\\n\\n//Artifact (18)\\n \\n1 Azorius Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Chromatic Lantern \\n\\n\\n1 Crucible of Worlds \\n\\n\\n1 Cursed Totem \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Keyrune \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Gilded Lotus \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Crypt \\n\\n\\n1 Mox Diamond \\n\\n\\n1 Nihil Spellbomb \\n\\n\\n1 Orzhov Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Sensei's Divining Top \\n\\n\\n1 Sol Ring \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Dominance \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Progress \\n\\n\\n1 Torpor Orb \\n\\n\\n1 Trinisphere \\n\\n\\n1 Uba Mask \\n\\n\\n//Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Sun Titan \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment (19) \\n\\n\\n1 Aura of Silence \\n\\n\\n1 Back to Basics \\n\\n\\n1 Ghostly Prison \\n\\n\\n1 Greater Auramancy \\n\\n\\n1 Humility \\n\\n\\n1 In the Eye of Chaos \\n\\n\\n1 Karmic Justice \\n\\n\\n1 Land Equilibrium \\n\\n\\n1 Land Tax \\n\\n\\n1 Leyline of the Void \\n\\n\\n1 Luminarch Ascension \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Breach \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Vortex \\n\\n\\n1 Monastery Siege \\n\\n\\n1 Mystic Remora \\n\\n\\n1 Phyrexian Arena \\n\\n\\n1 Propaganda \\n\\n\\n1 Rhystic Study \\n\\n\\n1 Sphere of Safety \\n\\n\\n//Instant (7)\\n\\n\\n1 Anguished Unmaking \\n\\n\\n1 Cyclonic Rift \\n\\n\\n1 Enlightened Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Lim-Dul's Vault \\n\\n\\n1 Path to Exile \\n\\n\\n1 Swords to Plowshares \\n\\n\\n1 Vampiric Tutor \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Erebos, God of the Dead \\n\\n\\n//Planeswalker (4) \\n\\n\\n1 Elspeth, Knight-Errant \\n\\n\\n1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor \\n\\n\\n1 Liliana of the Veil \\n\\n\\n1 Tezzeret the Seeker \\n\\n\\n//Sorcery (12) \\n\\n\\n1 Armageddon \\n\\n\\n1 Cataclysm \\n\\n\\n1 Catastrophe \\n\\n\\n1 Damnation \\n\\n\\n1 Demonic Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Merciless Eviction \\n\\n\\n1 Open the Vaults \\n\\n\\n1 Ravages of War \\n\\n\\n1 Replenish \\n\\n\\n1 Supreme Verdict \\n\\n\\n1 Toxic Deluge \\n\\n\\n1 Vindicate \\n\\n\\n//Land (37) \\n\\n\\n1 Academy Ruins \\n\\n\\n1 Ancient Tomb \\n\\n\\n1 Bojuka Bog \\n\\n\\n1 Cabal Coffers \\n\\n\\n1 Command Tower \\n\\n\\n1 Creeping Tar Pit \\n\\n\\n1 Flagstones of Trokair \\n\\n\\n1 Flooded Strand \\n\\n\\n1 Geier Reach Sanitarium \\n\\n\\n1 Godless Shrine \\n\\n\\n1 Hallowed Fountain \\n\\n\\n7 Island 1 Kor Haven \\n\\n\\n1 Marsh Flats \\n\\n\\n1 Maze of Ith \\n\\n\\n5 Plains \\n\\n\\n1 Polluted Delta \\n\\n\\n1 Reflecting Pool \\n\\n\\n1 Serra's Sanctum \\n\\n\\n1 Strip Mine \\n\\n\\n5 Swamp \\n\\n\\n1 Tolaria West \\n\\n\\n1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth \\n\\n\\n(((https://www.mtgvault.com/mibs80/decks/oloro-stax/ )))  \n",
       "458349  I cannot figure out for the life of me what is wrong with Helium. I downloaded the drivers, tried putting my phone in PTP, MTP, and every other option, I've tried plugging and unplugging the cord, setting the password for the encryption, nothing seems to work. it keeps giving the backup error and sometimes it asks me to input a password since my phone is supposedly encrypted. I'm on an S8. I have so many manga I need to Port over, this would be so terrible manually. Any help would be very appreciated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "458374  Not sure what you define as quickly but most games I see last around 30 minutes. I play teferi and my playgroup is breakfast hulk, doomsday kess, hackball, selvala brostorm, bloodpod, ezuri turns, teferi, edric, gitrog, and a few others I'm forgetting. I think it's a fairly expansive group with a lot of people and my games are almost never over in the first few turns. The key point of cEDH that you're obviously missing is THREATENING the win on t2-4, forgetting that other players usually don't allow that to happen...

       "458377  Your interest in in Green and Black, reanimation, as well as looking for a mid-range casual to eventual cEDH deck makes me believe that Karador would be a good choice for you. In a more casual meta, the removal of white is very good, and when 3 of your opponents are playing some variant of \"land ramp into fatties\" or \"turn creatures sideways\" the spot removal and more budget friendly board wipes of white will also in my opinion earn you more mileage over the counterspells in blue. Especially since some of the best counterspells (FoW, Flusterstorm, Pact of Negation) aren't as good in casual metas as they are in comp. Metas because they're bad tempo plays that are only good for protecting/stopping in a game winning  scenario (plus they're kind of expensive, especially since in a deck like yours where if you want to run Jin Gitaxas and other massive reanimate targets it'd likely be a priority to get yourself a Mana drain). The other reason I think that Karador is good for budget is because you don't need the good artifact ramp. Kodamas reach, nature's lore, and a suite of dorks will get you just as far for a whole lot less money. And finally, the ability to tune Karador to your meta is a lot higher than in other decks. You can simply switch around reanimation targets. For example, you could play the abzan praetors and Iona, and then add combos like Mike/trike, karmic guide, and maybe even Bomberman or boonweaver over time and to your meta. Good luck with your search!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "458403  For the Hazoret you need to fill out the playset of Hazoret and grab a playset of chainwhirler. The second sun deck is gonna be way more expensive to upgrade I think and harder to get back into magic with, plus it isn't as good in the meta right now so you'll probably be more successful w the aggro deck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

Ive never had dope taste like this. Its not vinegary at all, but the dope is very good. The bags i get from queens are the same potency or better, but still hold the normal 10-12 hours. Ive wondered for a while if the newark bags i get are cut with methadone or some other long acting opiate. From a business stand point it doesnt make sense. You want people to get sick quick so they have to buy more. It just doesnt make sense though. These bags are always really good, but ive had better bags that didnt hold me half the time these do. It sucks for me cause im on sub and i like gettig high for a day or two, but i hate having to wait a day and a half to redose my sub to avoid pwds.</td>\n",

And the third most common way its sold im corner bags by weight. I still prefer getting bundles of caps or stamps. When its sold by weight you can get it for $120/g but its not very good. Good shit is $180-200/g, but i still feel a the caps or bags is better even if they have some cut on them. You can get 20 fire caps for $150-160 and even though the quality is a little less, its still good and you get WAY more quantity for which more than makes up for the quality.</td>\n",

       "      <td>1. I live in a medium sized city in VA and dope is everywhere here. I grew up in a middle to upper middle class neighborhood and almost all of my guy friends and a lot girls are or have been heroin users. Its really kinda shocking cause we are all kids of doctors, lawyers, judges and professionals. Most of us started with pills then moved to H. Most of the dealers are black and id say 75%+ of their clientele is white. Id say the prices are average for the US, not really high like some small towns, but not as cheap as newark either.\\n\\n2. I only score from people IRL. although i do follow the DNMs, i have a professional job and have way too much to lose getting caught with drugs in the mail.\\n\\n3. The opiate i use most days is suboxone. Im prescribed it by a dr to treat my opiate dependence. It lets me function like a normal member of society and i will buy heroin on payday. So i end up using heroin for 3-4 days a month.\\n\\n4. Thats hard to say. I def would not use everyday if i could go without WDs. But ive been doing this for 10 years and honestly at this point in my life ive kinda accepted that im a lifer, atleast for now.\\n\\n5. The suboxone def lets me live a relatively normal life. Ive had the same decent job for the past 6 years, i pay all my bills, i still spend most weekends driving around taking photos and traveling to see concerts.\\n\\n6. Most heroin in my area is bought in the ghetto. For over the past year we have been seeing a lot of prepackages stamps of heroin from the newark area(im in virginia.) Where it really comes from, i dont know. South east asia or south america? We tend to get the more off white to tan heroin which i believe comes from those countries.\\n\\n7. My best drug experiences have been on MDMA(with opiates a close second.) Being with a girl you love and rolling on mdma is so amazing you cant even describe how good it feels. Its literally what i would imagine heaven to feel like.\\n\\n8. I have quit several times. WDs are hell. I hate people who say its like the flu x100. For me its nothing like the flu. The worst part is the constant restlessness. Not being able to sleep AT ALL. The electric feeling going through your entire body. Add that too the sweating, runny nose, shitting and bone/muscle aches. Why did i start using again? Cause heroin feels good, its just this perfect content/safe feeling.

Most people in Chicago, newark, philly etc are getting 10-20% purity I believe and they have the best dope in the country so you do the math                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "210924  I have been wondering about this for a minute. Ive gotten bags from one source in newark for almost three years now and everytime this shit holds me for 36+ hours. Normally i start getting sick 10-12 hours after my last dose. Another strange thing about it is the color varies from batch to batch(brown-tan-white) but the smell and taste is always the same. Ive never had dope taste like this. Its not vinegary at all, but the dope is very good. The bags i get from queens are the same potency or better, but still hold the normal 10-12 hours. Ive wondered for a while if the newark bags i get are cut with methadone or some other long acting opiate. From a business stand point it doesnt make sense. You want people to get sick quick so they have to buy more. It just doesnt make sense though. These bags are always really good, but ive had better bags that didnt hold me half the time these do. It sucks for me cause im on sub and i like gettig high for a day or two, but i hate having to wait a day and a half to redose my sub to avoid pwds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "211011  Yeah i know. My tolerance is huge so if i sniff two bags and feel anything at all, then the dope is good. This shit is bitter as hell and tastes/smells like the bags i get from newark which are fire. This shit is still pretty good, it just isnt kicking my ass like i thpught it would going on the taste/smell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "211128  The most common way dope is sold in the 757 is in clear gelcaps, but in the past 2-3 years ive been seeing stamps a lot more often. For 2 years straight we were getting stamps straight from newark and queens but i havent seen those in a few months, but still see stamps that were put together down here. And the third most common way its sold im corner bags by weight. I still prefer getting bundles of caps or stamps. When its sold by weight you can get it for $120/g but its not very good. Good shit is $180-200/g, but i still feel a the caps or bags is better even if they have some cut on them. You can get 20 fire caps for $150-160 and even though the quality is a little less, its still good and you get WAY more quantity for which more than makes up for the quality.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "211359  1. I live in a medium sized city in VA and dope is everywhere here. I grew up in a middle to upper middle class neighborhood and almost all of my guy friends and a lot girls are or have been heroin users. Its really kinda shocking cause we are all kids of doctors, lawyers, judges and professionals. Most of us started with pills then moved to H. Most of the dealers are black and id say 75%+ of their clientele is white. Id say the prices are average for the US, not really high like some small towns, but not as cheap as newark either.\\n\\n2. I only score from people IRL. although i do follow the DNMs, i have a professional job and have way too much to lose getting caught with drugs in the mail.\\n\\n3. The opiate i use most days is suboxone. Im prescribed it by a dr to treat my opiate dependence. It lets me function like a normal member of society and i will buy heroin on payday. So i end up using heroin for 3-4 days a month.\\n\\n4. Thats hard to say. I def would not use everyday if i could go without WDs. But ive been doing this for 10 years and honestly at this point in my life ive kinda accepted that im a lifer, atleast for now.\\n\\n5. The suboxone def lets me live a relatively normal life. Ive had the same decent job for the past 6 years, i pay all my bills, i still spend most weekends driving around taking photos and traveling to see concerts.\\n\\n6. Most heroin in my area is bought in the ghetto. For over the past year we have been seeing a lot of prepackages stamps of heroin from the newark area(im in virginia.) Where it really comes from, i dont know. South east asia or south america? We tend to get the more off white to tan heroin which i believe comes from those countries.\\n\\n7. My best drug experiences have been on MDMA(with opiates a close second.) Being with a girl you love and rolling on mdma is so amazing you cant even describe how good it feels. Its literally what i would imagine heaven to feel like.\\n\\n8. I have quit several times. WDs are hell. I hate people who say its like the flu x100. For me its nothing like the flu. The worst part is the constant restlessness. Not being able to sleep AT ALL. The electric feeling going through your entire body. Add that too the sweating, runny nose, shitting and bone/muscle aches. Why did i start using again? Cause heroin feels good, its just this perfect content/safe feeling. Like everything is gonna be ok.   \n",

I put dBoy's half on my scale and it registered 0.50 g, which is light considering the ziploc bag's weight. dBoy said \"Your scale is wrong. I know my shit is right\".  I asked him to Google the weight of a quarter, I hit my coin jar and I put a quarter on my new scale. Lo and behold, my scale registers 0.57 g, while the internet said that a quarter = 0.567 g ([https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f)), which is good enough for government work.\\n\\nI'm like \"what's up with that?\" and dBoy starts stammering and stuttering because he knows that he was WRONG ALL ALONG and I just caught him red-handed. dBoy takes his half back and adds to it until it registers 0.6 g with the bag, which is OK (but not cool, I mean, never-mind the rip-offs for the last two years).\\n\\nSo it's time for him to go and dBoy asks if he can buy my $10 scale for a dub, since he needs a new one. Now, it sounded like a great deal at the time because I only paid $8.78 taxed and shipped from Amazon.\\n\\n After dBoy left, I started to think about it. Maybe dBoy got me again! Here's my question to all my r/opiates bros and gals: Did dBoy buy my scale because he needed a new one OR did he buy my scale because he wanted to get that scale out of my hands so that I couldn't check him?  What do you guys think?</td>\n",

It's a kinda a sad story, but here it is for your enjoyment - or NOT.\\n\\nA long time ago there were two beautiful little girls, Angelique and Dominique. Angelique had long jet black hair while her sister Dominque had long blonde hair. They were both so cute and happy and playful. On Christmas Eve, Mom and Dad put all of their gifts under the Christmas tree. There were tons of gifts, not only from Mom and Dad, but also from Grandmom and Granddad and Uncles and Aunts and Cousins and family friends. There were baby dolls and Barbie dolls, coloring books and crayons and games. And there were clothes, beautiful clothes for little girls. It was going to be a perfect Christmas!\\n\\nChristmas Eve bedtime came and Angelique and Dominique said their prayers and snuggled into bed. They were so excited that they could hardly sleep. They literally could not wait for Christmas morning. It would be so wonderful! But sleep they did. \\n\\nDuring the night, a dark spirit came upon Mom and Dad. To some it was a demon; to others it was just a drug. It looked so harmless. It wasn't a gun or a knife. It was just a tiny piece of white. It had many names: base, hard, ready rock - you can Google them all, but most people just call it CRACK.\\n\\nSo Crack came that Christmas Eve and slowly one by one, the beautifully wrapped Christmas gifts disappeared. First the baby dolls - Angelique and Dominque were too old for them anyway. Then the Barbie dolls - hell they were sexist. And so Angelique and Dominique's Christmas gifts were taken by Crack until finally the gifts were no more.\\n\\nAs it has for billions of years, the earth turned and the sun rose and morning came. Angelique and Dominique jumped out of bed! They ran downstairs - their little hearts beating 160 and their tiny feet moving as fast as they could go. But something was wrong, very, very wrong. Where were the beautiful Christmas gifts? Perhaps it was a joke and Mom and Dad hid the gifts? But no, there were no Christmas gifts anywhere and like the dawn, it dawned on the the girls. As it had with the food stamps and the rent money and the new school clothes from Grandmom, Crack had taken them all. Angelique and Dominique didn't even cry. These two wonderful little girls had become hard, harder than diamonds. They could not be hurt anymore and that was the worse thing of all.\\n\\nThis is a true story, but, yes, I did take artistic license to embellish it some. I changed the names to protect the innocent and the guilty, or maybe I didn't. I hope your liked my cake day story.</td>\n",

I am NOT preaching, because the fact is that I was right behind her.\\n\\nIn the beginning, it was nice, may be once or twice a month.  Our use escalated to Mondays and Fridays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, well you know the rest.  I could not keep pace with her because I didn't have the funds, but otherwise I'd be right with her.\\n\\nStaying up all night, not eating, not pooping and not hydrating began to take it's toll.  Her silky, long, auburn hair was stringy and unwashed.  Her clothes went from Nordstrom to Goodwill. Her car was always in need of routine maintenance and she went from car dealers to backyard mechanics.  Still, nothing that she couldn't recover from.\\n\\nShe started \"dating\" men, drug dealers, who she'd not give a second look before. She ran through a series of two month \"relationships\" with these guys.  It seems that after they got what they wanted, these men had no more use for her. Fortunately, she was not diseased by these \"affairs\". Also, she pawned her things and then began to borrow and steal from family and friends.\\n\\nThe end came when she developed a deviated septum caused by the coke eating away at her nose. She had good insurance through her parents and the surgeons were able to fix her deviated septum.  All she had to do was to let the surgery heal, i.e. stay away from cocaine for a couple weeks. She could not stay away and the surgery failed, nearly causing permanent damage to her nose. Her doctors knew that she needed help and she accepted the chance to go to rehab.\\n\\nShe's married with kids and happy and healthy now.  Take care.</td>\n",

I live in Virginia and I read the applicable chapter in the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (VRLTA).  It was pretty straightforward, but I have questions.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI read that the landlord must provide *24 hour written notice* stating the people, the date and the time.  My landlord NEVER did this. People just entered using the lockbox on the door.  Is this legal?  Can I tell the people to get out? \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n The VRLTA said that access should be only during *reasonable* times.  My question is what is reasonable?  To me, 9:00 am Monday morning is reasonable, but 9:00 am Sunday morning is NOT.  I was butterball naked the other day and people just walked in.  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI am concerned about people stealing.  In my work, I prove bonds so that the customer is protected.

So Lep is now back in the Game. \\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Lep signed his car title over to Robert, who was his partner, so that he could sell it and put the money in Leprechaun's commissary account.\\n\\nWhen he was arrested, everyone thought that that was all for Lep. He had a long rap sheet and had spent 20+ years in prison. No one, including Robert, imagined that Lep would be out in less than five years. So Robbing Robert just kept ALL the money from selling Leprechaun's car.\\n\\nWhen he was released last month, Leprechaun tried to reason with Robert about his money. Obviously, Lep didn't need any more trouble, but Robert being the smart ass thief that he is, told Lep to fuck-off.  On the street, it's one thing to steal, but it's another thing entirely to humiliate a man. \\n\\nLep is about the most violent man that I have ever known. He stabbed a man in the throat over a girl. He hit a man with a brick multiple times in the head because he would not let Lep crash at his crib one winter night when Lep was outdoors. .  But the worse was when Lep hit a tiny girl - a 5 foot 98 pound babygirl - repeatedly with a wine bottle because her husband was getting out of jail and she told Lep that she would not be seeing him anymore. HELL, Lep survived over 20 years in prison so he had to be hard.\\n\\nWord is that Lep is running the streets telling everyone that he is going to stab Robert. Robert  is supposedly hiding out at his first wife's place until he can get some money and Lep cools down. \\n\\nSo will Lep really stab Robert or at least beat him up or will Robert wiggle out of this one too?

If they are really good, they obviously perform better than someone who commands a lower salary. If they aren't, they are seen as a loss. But the correlation suggests that the scouting department pretty much knows their job. \\n\\nRemember, this is an imperfect competition. You will have some variations in a hypothetical quality vs wage list graph as opposed to the norm of 100% correlation. But it is more or less, well relatable.\\n\\nI agree the point of the managers being irrelevant is oversimplified. I can give you cases. Jurgen Klinsmann was a bad manager, according to Philip Lahm, and the players realized it early enough. But my point is, the role of the manager is pretty much well-defined, which accounts for the apparent irrelevance of the role. That's what I said above. There's a brilliant example for this. Sir Alex, he's hardly changed his style over two decades, his teams play in the same fashion over the years. He had to perform a 'revolution' when changing to a diamond formation. You really think this field requires innovation?\\n\\nThe Art of Management in my opinion, has become a well-established 'constant' profession. You may even be able to list down the different styles, and managers who come under that. In terms of similarity, Moyes and Ferguson come first to my mind. Jose M, Jurgen Klopp seem very similar. Roberto Martinez, Michael Laudrup. Tony Pulis, Sam Allardyce. In fact, I think Kuper hit upon a gem when he said Pulis was much better than the norm. We all know that intuitively, I think.\\n\\nI think generally, you can relate the apparent irrelevance of a person in a job to the job being pretty much well-defined. But yeah, he does come to a wrong conclusion when belittling the role of the manager.</td>\n",

Their fans should understand what the team is trying to do to benefit themselves. It's like real life. Clubs are very much like people. They try to take the best decision for themselves. If they deliberately lose on a whim, they'll lose their fans who certainly aren't stupid. The club isn't stupid. I'm 100% sure Swansea won't intentionally play poorly, unless they've been paid to lose.\\n\\nImagine this as a whole system of people. There might also be the possibility that Swansea may have to think of their future relations with City or United. There are a lot of things at stake. It's real life.

How the hell does a dose of money for the smaller club harm these intentions.\\n\\nThe only thing that can happen is that the team at the receiving end (possibly a 'bigger' club) will be at harm.

Sublingual ROA is for a lot of the drug to seep in through your handy dandy capillaries under your tongue. Fortunately, this happens quickly and also as long as you don't swallow the entire pill, swallowing some saliva with a little bit of the sub in it isn't going to waste it or fuck anything up. The biggest thing to know about subs is precipitated withdrawal! Basically, wait like at least 24 hours after taking dope to take suboxone or else you'll have immediate, really intense WD symptoms. Good rule of thumb is to only take subs after taking dope if you're definitely dope sick, then you should be right as rain. Another thing is that suboxone's dosing, to some extent, is non linear. Meaning, if you're trying to get fucked up on suboxone, just continually taking more suboxone is not gonna do it usually, also in my experience firsthand and also from speaking to people who have used subs before, subs will make you feel kinda high when you first start out taking them and then not at all again, no matter how much you change your dose. anyway, if you have any questions let me know.

In a more casual meta, the removal of white is very good, and when 3 of your opponents are playing some variant of \"land ramp into fatties\" or \"turn creatures sideways\" the spot removal and more budget friendly board wipes of white will also in my opinion earn you more mileage over the counterspells in blue. Especially since some of the best counterspells (FoW, Flusterstorm, Pact of Negation) aren't as good in casual metas as they are in comp. Metas because they're bad tempo plays that are only good for protecting/stopping in a game winning  scenario (plus they're kind of expensive, especially since in a deck like yours where if you want to run Jin Gitaxas and other massive reanimate targets it'd likely be a priority to get yourself a Mana drain). The other reason I think that Karador is good for budget is because you don't need the good artifact ramp. Kodamas reach, nature's lore, and a suite of dorks will get you just as far for a whole lot less money. And finally, the ability to tune Karador to your meta is a lot higher than in other decks. You can simply switch around reanimation targets. For example, you could play the abzan praetors and Iona, and then add combos like Mike/trike, karmic guide, and maybe even Bomberman or boonweaver over time and to your meta. Good luck with your search!</td>\n",

       "1       I was trying to think of an opiate game that we could all play while under Stay-At-Home. Here's one.\\n\\n**The Stages of WDs**\\n\\nThe player tries to list in correct order all the Stages of WDs from initial to final. They player with the most stages in the correct order without dupes wins. For example, if the game was to drive your automobile to the liquor store, the stages would be\\n\\n1. Get in automobile\\n2. Check gas\\n3. Adjust seat\\n4. Adjust mirrors\\n5. Set radio\\n6. Insert key\\n7. Turn key\\n8. etc., etc., etc\\n9. ....\\n\\nFor **The Stages of WDs**, the first three stages MIGHT be (this is just an example and is not correct)\\n\\n1. Runny nose\\n2. Puking\\n3. Pooping\\n\\nYou get the idea.

       "10      Junky Jesus is real! I was down to my last $5 and it was only Wednesday. DAMN! Why did I pay my stupid bills?  I have two pillows, but I only use one. I decided to switch up tonight and use my other pillow. I laid down my head, worrying about getting sick, but something felt weird in my pillow. Could it be? YES! I found $120 hidden in the pillow case. HALLELUJAH! JJ IS REAL!

       "29      This Chomo will likely get 3 years and get out in 18 months, but you get caught with a dub or a 30 and its 5 years. In fact, Chomo may not get **anytime at all** because the kids are too young to testify and therefore there are no witnesses to the crime. And they call that Justice in America. At least the dad got in some pretty good licks in judging by Chomo's face.

       "30      I'm watching Locked Up Abroad on National Geographic channel. I can't believe how foolish these people are smuggling H from Bangkok for some Nigerian guy.

       "32      I thought that dBoy's bags were light, so I asked for advice on r/opiates about a cheap scale. Thanks to you guys, I received a lot of replies and I bought a $10 scale from Amazon that was delivered the other day.\\n\\nOn NYE (today), dBoy was in my area at the clinic and he stopped by my house for a NYE drink (for once he brought his own Mickeys). I bought a half from him and only then I broke-out my new scale. I put dBoy's half on my scale and it registered 0.50 g, which is light considering the ziploc bag's weight. dBoy said \"Your scale is wrong. I know my shit is right\".  I asked him to Google the weight of a quarter, I hit my coin jar and I put a quarter on my new scale. Lo and behold, my scale registers 0.57 g, while the internet said that a quarter = 0.567 g ([https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f](https://www.reference.com/business-finance/much-quarter-weigh-a84ccf4c36e1915f)), which is good enough for government work.\\n\\nI'm like \"what's up with that?\" and dBoy starts stammering and stuttering because he knows that he was WRONG ALL ALONG and I just caught him red-handed. dBoy takes his half back and adds to it until it registers 0.6 g with the bag, which is OK (but not cool, I mean, never-mind the rip-offs for the last two years).\\n\\nSo it's time for him to go and dBoy asks if he can buy my $10 scale for a dub, since he needs a new one. Now, it sounded like a great deal at the time because I only paid $8.78 taxed and shipped from Amazon.\\n\\n After dBoy left, I started to think about it. Maybe dBoy got me again! Here's my question to all my r/opiates bros and gals: Did dBoy buy my scale because he needed a new one OR did he buy my scale because he wanted to get that scale out of my hands so that I couldn't check him?  What do you guys think?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "33      I wanted to post something special on my cake day. It's a kinda a sad story, but here it is for your enjoyment - or NOT.\\n\\nA long time ago there were two beautiful little girls, Angelique and Dominique. Angelique had long jet black hair while her sister Dominque had long blonde hair. They were both so cute and happy and playful. On Christmas Eve, Mom and Dad put all of their gifts under the Christmas tree. There were tons of gifts, not only from Mom and Dad, but also from Grandmom and Granddad and Uncles and Aunts and Cousins and family friends. There were baby dolls and Barbie dolls, coloring books and crayons and games. And there were clothes, beautiful clothes for little girls. It was going to be a perfect Christmas!\\n\\nChristmas Eve bedtime came and Angelique and Dominique said their prayers and snuggled into bed. They were so excited that they could hardly sleep. They literally could not wait for Christmas morning. It would be so wonderful! But sleep they did. \\n\\nDuring the night, a dark spirit came upon Mom and Dad. To some it was a demon; to others it was just a drug. It looked so harmless. It wasn't a gun or a knife. It was just a tiny piece of white. It had many names: base, hard, ready rock - you can Google them all, but most people just call it CRACK.\\n\\nSo Crack came that Christmas Eve and slowly one by one, the beautifully wrapped Christmas gifts disappeared. First the baby dolls - Angelique and Dominque were too old for them anyway. Then the Barbie dolls - hell they were sexist. And so Angelique and Dominique's Christmas gifts were taken by Crack until finally the gifts were no more.\\n\\nAs it has for billions of years, the earth turned and the sun rose and morning came. Angelique and Dominique jumped out of bed! They ran downstairs - their little hearts beating 160 and their tiny feet moving as fast as they could go. But something was wrong, very, very wrong. Where were the beautiful Christmas gifts? Perhaps it was a joke and Mom and Dad hid the gifts? But no, there were no Christmas gifts anywhere and like the dawn, it dawned on the the girls. As it had with the food stamps and the rent money and the new school clothes from Grandmom, Crack had taken them all. Angelique and Dominique didn't even cry. These two wonderful little girls had become hard, harder than diamonds. They could not be hurt anymore and that was the worse thing of all.\\n\\nThis is a true story, but, yes, I did take artistic license to embellish it some. I changed the names to protect the innocent and the guilty, or maybe I didn't. I hope your liked my cake day story.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I really think you guys and girls can give me good advice because of your unique experiences. \\n\\r\\nI know a guy who is wanted by the US MARSHALLS FOR VIOLENT RAPE. Specifically, he raped a little boy - a tiny, little, defenseless five-year old boy. Before you jump on me, I don't know where this guy lives but I do know a guy who does know where he lives or at least sleeps.\\r\\nObviously, I don’t want the cops poking around my apartment. On the other hand, I really want this child rapist brought to justice, as I am sure that you all do. On the third hand, I hate SNITCHES.

       "55      I started anew job on October 3. I was fucking up like calling in when I was dope sick and being slow in general. So they finally they let me go. It wasn't because of misconduct. I was always one time,. I was just slow (guess why). The job just wasn't working out for me. So, the HR people called me in and I was ready for the bad news.\\n a\\nI was wanted to fight for 4 weeks notice from HR instead of the regular 2 weeks. Again, I wasn't charged with misconduct. I was just slow. They didn't really have anything concrete against me.\\n\\nSo again, I go into the HR office ready to fight.

       "74      &#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a story of a young, beautiful girl who was hurt, but not destroyed, by cocaine. I am NOT preaching, because the fact is that I was right behind her.\\n\\nIn the beginning, it was nice, may be once or twice a month.  Our use escalated to Mondays and Fridays, then Tuesdays and Thursdays, then, well you know the rest.  I could not keep pace with her because I didn't have the funds, but otherwise I'd be right with her.\\n\\nStaying up all night, not eating, not pooping and not hydrating began to take it's toll.  Her silky, long, auburn hair was stringy and unwashed.  Her clothes went from Nordstrom to Goodwill. Her car was always in need of routine maintenance and she went from car dealers to backyard mechanics.  Still, nothing that she couldn't recover from.\\n\\nShe started \"dating\" men, drug dealers, who she'd not give a second look before. She ran through a series of two month \"relationships\" with these guys.  It seems that after they got what they wanted, these men had no more use for her. Fortunately, she was not diseased by these \"affairs\". Also, she pawned her things and then began to borrow and steal from family and friends.\\n\\nThe end came when she developed a deviated septum caused by the coke eating away at her nose. She had good insurance through her parents and the surgeons were able to fix her deviated septum.  All she had to do was to let the surgery heal, i.e. stay away from cocaine for a couple weeks. She could not stay away and the surgery failed, nearly causing permanent damage to her nose. Her doctors knew that she needed help and she accepted the chance to go to rehab.\\n\\nShe's married with kids and happy and healthy now.

       "89      My landlord is showing my apartment so that he can sell it at the end of my lease.  I understand that it's his property and that he has every right to sell it and that I will have to move.  My question concerns access by the realtors and prospective buyers.  I live in Virginia and I read the applicable chapter in the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (VRLTA).  It was pretty straightforward, but I have questions.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI read that the landlord must provide *24 hour written notice* stating the people, the date and the time.  My landlord NEVER did this. People just entered using the lockbox on the door.  Is this legal?  Can I tell the people to get out? \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n The VRLTA said that access should be only during *reasonable* times.  My question is what is reasonable?  To me, 9:00 am Monday morning is reasonable, but 9:00 am Sunday morning is NOT.  I was butterball naked the other day and people just walked in.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am concerned about people stealing.  In my work, I prove bonds so that the customer is protected.  Can I make my landlord fully responsible if anything is stolen?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am also concerned about any retaliation from the landlord if I start asking for these lawful things.  I know that he is not renewing the lease, but he can still make my life miserable with the utilities, repairs and such.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is a rhetorical question, but why are landlords allowed to make things miserable for good, hard-working Americans who always pay their rent on time?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThanks, METRO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "95      I thought you guys might like a story about dBoy drama and street justice. \\n\\nLeprechaun was my ex dBoy who was jailed on a distro charge, but the judge had to set him free because the testing lab was overloaded and couldn't test Leprechaun's stuff within the time limit.  So Lep is now back in the Game. \\n\\nWhile he was in jail, Lep signed his car title over to Robert, who was his partner, so that he could sell it and put the money in Leprechaun's commissary account.\\n\\nWhen he was arrested, everyone thought that that was all for Lep. He had a long rap sheet and had spent 20+ years in prison. No one, including Robert, imagined that Lep would be out in less than five years. So Robbing Robert just kept ALL the money from selling Leprechaun's car.\\n\\nWhen he was released last month, Leprechaun tried to reason with Robert about his money. Obviously, Lep didn't need any more trouble, but Robert being the smart ass thief that he is, told Lep to fuck-off.  On the street, it's one thing to steal, but it's another thing entirely to humiliate a man. \\n\\nLep is about the most violent man that I have ever known. He stabbed a man in the throat over a girl. He hit a man with a brick multiple times in the head because he would not let Lep crash at his crib one winter night when Lep was outdoors. .  But the worse was when Lep hit a tiny girl - a 5 foot 98 pound babygirl - repeatedly with a wine bottle because her husband was getting out of jail and she told Lep that she would not be seeing him anymore. HELL, Lep survived over 20 years in prison so he had to be hard.\\n\\nWord is that Lep is running the streets telling everyone that he is going to stab Robert. Robert  is supposedly hiding out at his first wife's place until he can get some money and Lep cools down. \\n\\nSo will Lep really stab Robert or at least beat him up or will Robert wiggle out of this one too?  What say you.?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "109     This post is mostly for guys, but maybe girls too (although I don't see anyone wanting to eat out Trap girls) . Traps always have girls that are looking to make money to feed their addictions. I feel kinda gross doing money-for-favors, so I usually just throw the girl a dub without any expectations. However then I FEEL like a sucker - I mean I didn't get nada. The black guys just say something like \"get away from me you filthy Ho\", but I am just NOT that type of guy. Also, they are kinda like birds, if you feed one the whole flock descends. And I feel so sorry for these poor girls. \\n\\nWho has advice for poor Metro?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

Someone tell me WHY?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "159     Church Girl called me Sunday morning to tell me that we were going to the 12:30 pm Mass. I don't like attending those late Masses because I want to watch the NFL which starts at 1:00 pm.\\n\\nSo I tell Church Girl that I was sick. She kept pressing me about what exactly was wrong. Finally, I got tired of her nagging so I texted :\\n\\nThe truth is that I don't want to go to church because I am getting high.\\n\\nShe texted back :\\n\\nThere you go excuses, excuses. Your priorities are a mess- getting high instead of going to church.\\n\\nSo, now she is mad at me again, BUT I am proud because I went high when she went\\n low and texted back :\\n\\nHave a good day\\n\\nWhat a life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "191     I was told that pre-employment drug test are always sent to the lab and are impossible to beat w/o switching urine.

And worse of all they sit back and count their money while our friends and family OD. \\n\\nAren't they the REAL FIENDS - the REAL MONSTERS?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "216     Last week Church Girl called and asked me if I wanted to come over and see her new puppy.  Everyone likes new puppies so sure. So. Church Girl picks me up after work and we head over to her apt.\\n\\nShe opens the door and the puppy comes rushing out. Unfortunately, the puppy is only half house broken so her apt smelled, but that was too be expected. I didn't say anything because I didn't want her cleaning while I was visiting.\\n\\nThe puppy was an American bulldog about 8 weeks old and very cute.  I didn't know this,, but bulldogs have been so genetically engineered that they can't even mate w/o human help. The male's legs are so short that he can't mount the female on his own. That's kinda messed up, but onto my mounting.\\n\\nI was playing with the puppy and Church Girl went into her bedroom.  From the bedroom, She said to me \"It feels so good to get out of work clothes after a long day\" and she comes out in just bra and panties.  Remember, that we haven't been intimate.\\n\\nI'm trying to be Joe Cool, but damn any almost- naked woman at her peak of sexual attraction is just wonderful. So I am futilely trying to look without looking.  She goes into the kitchen and asks me if I am hungry and she'll make me some pasta or something. (What is it with Italian girls and feeding a man?).\\n\\nI was just about to make my move when she says \"I clean and cook and I know how to take care of a man. See what a good wife would be?\"  and then she brings up my GF and how I have to leave my GF for her.\\n\\nI played with the puppy a little more and said I was tired and went home,thinking \"I am such a loser. A beautiful woman just put it in my face and I couldn't lie to her and tell her that I would leave my GF for her.\"  So here I am, just another loser,, sleeping all alone.

IT WOULD BE SO GREAT, THAT I WOULD CREAM MY PANTS. \\n\\nWhat's your cop fantasy?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "237     So Church Girl gets her refill of ninety 20mg Adderall.  I like to be focused and productive and so I ask her for 1 (as in O-N-E)  pill. She texts back \"you are getting to be a pain in the ass\".\\n\\nI took this girl to IHOP Saturday night and then we went clothes shopping. She wanted to buy a pair of jeans, but when we got to the checkout she was short $27. Like the fool I am and will always be, I lent her the money which she swore to repay.\\nSo at this point, I'm pissed. I write back \"KEEP YOUR STINKING DRUGS, JUST PAY ME MY MONEY\".  I feel bad about that, because she doesn't make much and she is struggling. \\n\\nYou guys told me that these Adderall are her medicine and she needs them for ADHD, but still 1 pill?

       "244     We've had a lot of shit posts lately and I want to lighten things up a bit. So here is my latest escapade with Church Girl. \\n\\nI had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. \\n\\n Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me \"where is all your money going\", but she coughed up the cash.\\n\\nNow here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?\\n\\nI played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  \"the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive\". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say \"damn girl, you're a speed addict\".\\n\\nI told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.\\n\\nNow I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!\\n\\nSo there you have it. Church Girl is a speed freak and she doesn't even know it!!!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "245     I have two 10 mg Adderall. I was told to eat just one pill with a strong coffee on an empty stomach before work. \\n\\nI have no stim tolerance. It's been over a year since I took any stimulants and that was only two coke lines in summer 2017.\\n\\nIs one 10mg pill effective or should I take both pills (20mg)? . Also, I will be at work and I can't be zooming.\\n\\nThanks guys.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "457951  yeah, not a problem, but what's happening in America is like the birth of a social phenomenon. Just reading about the growth (and the events that perpetuated it) of soccer is a wonderful window to explore human dynamics. I think this is at the heart of soccer at every single level right from the playing field, managing side, to the boardroom and the impact on the general community. That's why you also have a lot of A-League links too. It's great, isn't it?\\n\\nI don't think this subreddit is A-centric. The quality in the American and Australian leagues are nowhere near as good as those in Europe. Obviously, you can't say we aren't watching adequate footballing action on here.

       "457979  Yeah.. but they could be duds, right? That's the point...\\nIt is more or less well done. The players who are perceived to perform best command the higher salaries. If they are really good, they obviously perform better than someone who commands a lower salary. If they aren't, they are seen as a loss. But the correlation suggests that the scouting department pretty much knows their job. \\n\\nRemember, this is an imperfect competition. You will have some variations in a hypothetical quality vs wage list graph as opposed to the norm of 100% correlation. But it is more or less, well relatable.\\n\\nI agree the point of the managers being irrelevant is oversimplified. I can give you cases. Jurgen Klinsmann was a bad manager, according to Philip Lahm, and the players realized it early enough. But my point is, the role of the manager is pretty much well-defined, which accounts for the apparent irrelevance of the role. That's what I said above. There's a brilliant example for this. Sir Alex, he's hardly changed his style over two decades, his teams play in the same fashion over the years. He had to perform a 'revolution' when changing to a diamond formation. You really think this field requires innovation?\\n\\nThe Art of Management in my opinion, has become a well-established 'constant' profession. You may even be able to list down the different styles, and managers who come under that. In terms of similarity, Moyes and Ferguson come first to my mind. Jose M, Jurgen Klopp seem very similar. Roberto Martinez, Michael Laudrup. Tony Pulis, Sam Allardyce. In fact, I think Kuper hit upon a gem when he said Pulis was much better than the norm. We all know that intuitively, I think.\\n\\nI think generally, you can relate the apparent irrelevance of a person in a job to the job being pretty much well-defined. But yeah, he does come to a wrong conclusion when belittling the role of the manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "457991  My point is in this case is why wouldn't City offer money? If they are in such a desperate situation, they would offer money.\\n\\nSwansea know they will try to win or do what they would normally do in that position. Say they might play their youth players to gain experience. They would follow their own plans. They have a lot at stake. Remember, they have to care about their own fans too. Their fans should understand what the team is trying to do to benefit themselves. It's like real life. Clubs are very much like people. They try to take the best decision for themselves. If they deliberately lose on a whim, they'll lose their fans who certainly aren't stupid. The club isn't stupid. I'm 100% sure Swansea won't intentionally play poorly, unless they've been paid to lose.\\n\\nImagine this as a whole system of people. There might also be the possibility that Swansea may have to think of their future relations with City or United. There are a lot of things at stake. It's real life. I don't understand why this can't make football a lot more interesting or egalitarian. Anyways, the smaller clubs gain if they're getting money from larger clubs. \\n\\nThe whole game would become unbelievably exciting, if you ask me, exactly like real life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "458003  What the f*** is the problem with that, I don't get it. Define 'unsporting'. Supporters? This is human nature. We want to maximize our benefit. The players want to maximize their benefit. The club wants to maximize their benefit. The supporters want to maximize their benefit. How the hell does a dose of money for the smaller club harm these intentions.\\n\\nThe only thing that can happen is that the team at the receiving end (possibly a 'bigger' club) will be at harm. But the point is that this team also has equal opportunity as the other 'bigger' club giving money of 'manipulating' a game.\\n\\nIf the supporters don't understand that, they're living in a bubble. Anyway, the fact that they are supporters probably makes them irrational.\\n\\nIt's life. It's not manipulation. Listen. If the richer club pays a poorer club to beat another richer club, I just cannot understand how the league becomes less competitive. The poorer clubs only gain monetarily, while one or more of the richer clubs lose monetarily. IF anything, it will increase competition.\\n\\nThe financial incentive situation is identical to England offering a bonus to their players if they win. This is also a situation of real life influencing the footballing world unfairly. You seem to be suggesting the players do not necessarily play to win for their national side, if you sanction the need for bonuses. 'Unsporting'? You tell me.\\n\\nSorry for the anger.

       "458005  The anger is more a result of societal jealousy against footballers, who they see as earning more than they deserve. There are absolute fools who write for the papers in the UK.

       "458058  Suboxone is nice stuff. To answer your ROA question, you can swallow that spit my guy, you don't have to let it puff out like that. Sublingual ROA is for a lot of the drug to seep in through your handy dandy capillaries under your tongue. Fortunately, this happens quickly and also as long as you don't swallow the entire pill, swallowing some saliva with a little bit of the sub in it isn't going to waste it or fuck anything up. The biggest thing to know about subs is precipitated withdrawal! Basically, wait like at least 24 hours after taking dope to take suboxone or else you'll have immediate, really intense WD symptoms. Good rule of thumb is to only take subs after taking dope if you're definitely dope sick, then you should be right as rain. Another thing is that suboxone's dosing, to some extent, is non linear. Meaning, if you're trying to get fucked up on suboxone, just continually taking more suboxone is not gonna do it usually, also in my experience firsthand and also from speaking to people who have used subs before, subs will make you feel kinda high when you first start out taking them and then not at all again, no matter how much you change your dose. anyway, if you have any questions let me know.

       "458167  Mmmmmm I'd been doing pills awhile and lost my connect. Needed a new option to stay right and dope it was. Was gonna be in an unknown city for 6 hours waiting for a bus. Copped, and couldn't wait so I did it in a major mall bathroom in a large US city just an hour before my bus was meant to arrive.

I definitely feel like the whole ritual of my drug use plays a big part in my addiction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "458343  Hey cEDH players, I have been trying to find a stax deck and I want to see some opinions/thoughts from you guys. So far I've gotten two decks in my head, cause I don't want to play green, those being Chain veil teferi and oloro, ageless ascetic. \\nI have a prospective oloro list built up that I might buy if I get it more tuned. (Forgive me if I formatted it wrong, i read FAQ/community guidelines but it didn't say how just to do it) \\nIf you guys can guide me to a nice primer or list on teferi, Id appreciate it. My meta is competitive, but I think I would rather play oloro unless teferi is just that much better because I own a lot of the cards. Any comments are appreciated, thank you\\n\\n//Artifact (18)\\n \\n1 Azorius Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Chromatic Lantern \\n\\n\\n1 Crucible of Worlds \\n\\n\\n1 Cursed Totem \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Keyrune \\n\\n\\n1 Dimir Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Gilded Lotus \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Crypt \\n\\n\\n1 Mox Diamond \\n\\n\\n1 Nihil Spellbomb \\n\\n\\n1 Orzhov Signet \\n\\n\\n1 Sensei's Divining Top \\n\\n\\n1 Sol Ring \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Dominance \\n\\n\\n1 Talisman of Progress \\n\\n\\n1 Torpor Orb \\n\\n\\n1 Trinisphere \\n\\n\\n1 Uba Mask \\n\\n\\n//Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Sun Titan \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment (19) \\n\\n\\n1 Aura of Silence \\n\\n\\n1 Back to Basics \\n\\n\\n1 Ghostly Prison \\n\\n\\n1 Greater Auramancy \\n\\n\\n1 Humility \\n\\n\\n1 In the Eye of Chaos \\n\\n\\n1 Karmic Justice \\n\\n\\n1 Land Equilibrium \\n\\n\\n1 Land Tax \\n\\n\\n1 Leyline of the Void \\n\\n\\n1 Luminarch Ascension \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Breach \\n\\n\\n1 Mana Vortex \\n\\n\\n1 Monastery Siege \\n\\n\\n1 Mystic Remora \\n\\n\\n1 Phyrexian Arena \\n\\n\\n1 Propaganda \\n\\n\\n1 Rhystic Study \\n\\n\\n1 Sphere of Safety \\n\\n\\n//Instant (7)\\n\\n\\n1 Anguished Unmaking \\n\\n\\n1 Cyclonic Rift \\n\\n\\n1 Enlightened Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Lim-Dul's Vault \\n\\n\\n1 Path to Exile \\n\\n\\n1 Swords to Plowshares \\n\\n\\n1 Vampiric Tutor \\n\\n\\n//Enchantment Creature (1) \\n\\n\\n1 Erebos, God of the Dead \\n\\n\\n//Planeswalker (4) \\n\\n\\n1 Elspeth, Knight-Errant \\n\\n\\n1 Jace, the Mind Sculptor \\n\\n\\n1 Liliana of the Veil \\n\\n\\n1 Tezzeret the Seeker \\n\\n\\n//Sorcery (12) \\n\\n\\n1 Armageddon \\n\\n\\n1 Cataclysm \\n\\n\\n1 Catastrophe \\n\\n\\n1 Damnation \\n\\n\\n1 Demonic Tutor \\n\\n\\n1 Merciless Eviction \\n\\n\\n1 Open the Vaults \\n\\n\\n1 Ravages of War \\n\\n\\n1 Replenish \\n\\n\\n1 Supreme Verdict \\n\\n\\n1 Toxic Deluge \\n\\n\\n1 Vindicate \\n\\n\\n//Land (37) \\n\\n\\n1 Academy Ruins \\n\\n\\n1 Ancient Tomb \\n\\n\\n1 Bojuka Bog \\n\\n\\n1 Cabal Coffers \\n\\n\\n1 Command Tower \\n\\n\\n1 Creeping Tar Pit \\n\\n\\n1 Flagstones of Trokair \\n\\n\\n1 Flooded Strand \\n\\n\\n1 Geier Reach Sanitarium \\n\\n\\n1 Godless Shrine \\n\\n\\n1 Hallowed Fountain \\n\\n\\n7 Island 1 Kor Haven \\n\\n\\n1 Marsh Flats \\n\\n\\n1 Maze of Ith \\n\\n\\n5 Plains \\n\\n\\n1 Polluted Delta \\n\\n\\n1 Reflecting Pool \\n\\n\\n1 Serra's Sanctum \\n\\n\\n1 Strip Mine \\n\\n\\n5 Swamp \\n\\n\\n1 Tolaria West \\n\\n\\n1 Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth \\n\\n\\n(((https://www.mtgvault.com/mibs80/decks/oloro-stax/ )))  \n",
       "458349  I cannot figure out for the life of me what is wrong with Helium. I downloaded the drivers, tried putting my phone in PTP, MTP, and every other option, I've tried plugging and unplugging the cord, setting the password for the encryption, nothing seems to work. it keeps giving the backup error and sometimes it asks me to input a password since my phone is supposedly encrypted. I'm on an S8. I have so many manga I need to Port over, this would be so terrible manually. Any help would be very appreciated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "458374  Not sure what you define as quickly but most games I see last around 30 minutes. I play teferi and my playgroup is breakfast hulk, doomsday kess, hackball, selvala brostorm, bloodpod, ezuri turns, teferi, edric, gitrog, and a few others I'm forgetting. I think it's a fairly expansive group with a lot of people and my games are almost never over in the first few turns. The key point of cEDH that you're obviously missing is THREATENING the win on t2-4, forgetting that other players usually don't allow that to happen...

       "458377  Your interest in in Green and Black, reanimation, as well as looking for a mid-range casual to eventual cEDH deck makes me believe that Karador would be a good choice for you. In a more casual meta, the removal of white is very good, and when 3 of your opponents are playing some variant of \"land ramp into fatties\" or \"turn creatures sideways\" the spot removal and more budget friendly board wipes of white will also in my opinion earn you more mileage over the counterspells in blue. Especially since some of the best counterspells (FoW, Flusterstorm, Pact of Negation) aren't as good in casual metas as they are in comp. Metas because they're bad tempo plays that are only good for protecting/stopping in a game winning  scenario (plus they're kind of expensive, especially since in a deck like yours where if you want to run Jin Gitaxas and other massive reanimate targets it'd likely be a priority to get yourself a Mana drain). The other reason I think that Karador is good for budget is because you don't need the good artifact ramp. Kodamas reach, nature's lore, and a suite of dorks will get you just as far for a whole lot less money. And finally, the ability to tune Karador to your meta is a lot higher than in other decks. You can simply switch around reanimation targets. For example, you could play the abzan praetors and Iona, and then add combos like Mike/trike, karmic guide, and maybe even Bomberman or boonweaver over time and to your meta. Good luck with your search!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "458403  For the Hazoret you need to fill out the playset of Hazoret and grab a playset of chainwhirler. The second sun deck is gonna be way more expensive to upgrade I think and harder to get back into magic with, plus it isn't as good in the meta right now so you'll probably be more successful w the aggro deck.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
