(assuming by now the east coast is plugged up by the same dudes and that most of the dope sold in america comes from south america through the latin american pipeline)   \n",

      "i've always heard florida has a pretty lame dope scene, with generally higher prices and lower purity than just about anywhere else on the east coast (besides perhaps maine and other isolated areas). is it because of the popularity of painkillers, which still seem to be pretty widely available, despite the crackdown on pill mills? i understand that the port of miami inspects more cans in anticipation of drug trafficking, but then why is coke so popular/inexpensive? east coast coke *and* dope both move mostly through dr (and to an extent, puerto rico), and florida certainly has a healthy opiate scene that's saturated with addicts .. why doesn't the dope follow the coke? more than once, i've heard of dealers (or their mules) driving down from *philly* for their dope, and i can't think of any reason why .. does cocaine just have such a monstrously bigger scene there that dealers simply write off the loads that are seized (but then why not also traffic heroin) ? somebody please help me. i want to learn.\n",
