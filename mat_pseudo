PMAT pseudo code

Posts (P) will be composed of threads (Ti) and comments (Ci):

within treatment bin:

		terms should be identifiable by any combination of letters that match clinical, commercial, and colloquial names
i.e.

methadone =[]

'''Generate a list of the 10,000 words most frequently used in posts'''  
adjusted_tenk_words = tenk_words - 








	

tab the 10,000 most frequently used terms in MAT_posts:
	classify into chatagories related to:
		good medicinal sentiments:
			"recovery" "healing" 
		bad medicinal sentiments:
			abuse, misuse
		good social sentiments:
			"job", "family",
		bad social sentiments:
			diversion


for posts that have terms related to multiple bins, the bin with the most related terms gets the post
for posts that have terms that are equally frequent across bins,


To understand:
"open-vocabulary" sourcing method of finding 10,000 words
method in which to account for doublecounting
