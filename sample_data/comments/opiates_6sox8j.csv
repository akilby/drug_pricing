Other than that not much to expect, other than some orthostatic hypotension. ",RottingAsOne,1502324599.0

They def help me sleep which was nice. After a while I was able to take a them during the day no problem. In fact I'm where a clonadine patch right now. Not recommended, get the pill form if you can. I can't say it's ever really helped with my WD. ",Justlurkin4321,1502325036.0
dleod6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6sox8j/question_about_clonidine_just_got_rxed/,t3_6sox8j,"I'm on pain management and get clonidine 0.1mg 4x a day but rarely take them as they are REALLY helpful for withdrawal in combination with other meds but not as a medicine is use by itself for withdrawal. 

0.3mg + Kratom will completely stop my withdrawals in there tracks and put me to sleep. And that's withdrawals from IV Dilaudid which are pretty wicked. So I just hoard them up for a bad day or to help someone else out.

Just be careful standing up too fast and things like that. Your blood pressure is going to tank and you are likely to fall on your damn face.",JonWrong,1502328746.0
dlet3av,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6sox8j/question_about_clonidine_just_got_rxed/,t3_6sox8j,I find they help with hot flashes and sleep forsure. In combination with gabapentin the only wd symptom I get is some fatigue,TattedLegendUGKing,1502335022.0
dlevt6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6sox8j/question_about_clonidine_just_got_rxed/,t3_6sox8j,"I wouldn't expect anything. They have an effect but you won't notice it, just helps with the shakes and chills and sweating a bit, they gave it to me in rehab.

As far as mixing it with oxy, I would say don't..nit because it's not safe, but because if you're taking oxys then you aren't withdrawing, and you should only be taking this while you're withdrawing. So it'd be a waste to take it with oxy. ",nastyneeick,1502339124.0
