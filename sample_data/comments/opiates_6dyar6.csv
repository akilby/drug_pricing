It's not the use of the drug that's the problem, it's the over use. It's like an alcoholic thinking they can get in the car and drive to the store for more beer...there's a lot of risk and you will mess it up one day. Same thing with opiates. You want to get higher and higher? Well, eventually that will come at a cost. It doesn't matter if it's cheaper to buy, or you won't get in trouble...you're bound to cross a line if you continue to seek more. ",,1496040710.0
di6dfz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6dyar6/the_real_bullshit_about_opiates_is_artificial/,t3_6dyar6,"Yea it's just not cool that because someone needs opiates for pain reduction or even if they just like the high, they have to risk everything to use that drug, while an alcoholic can live a normal life financially and legally. All because our govt won't allow legal consumerism to take place with all products, not just opiates. 

Imagine being able to buy a bottle of 120 oxy for 10.99 at Walgreens OTC. Or a vial of 100% clean and safe heroin for 17.99. Immediately almost all of the stigmas and bad things that go with opiate use are negated. 

Ive said it a million times, if one makes enough money to afford his or her drug of choice while continuing to live an above average lifestyle as it is priced today, that person is never looked down upon as a junkie. They are just doing what they please and living how they want to live. Which is something everyone should be able to do legally in the land of the free. ",okeedope,1496039427.0

I used for 10 years - trust me, I know. What you aren't considering is 1) The development of ever-increasing tolerance, 2) the fact that opiates wreck your testosterone and other hormone levels (which has serious health consequences of a long period of time), 3) it depresses your immune system, 4) it rewires your sense of long term motivation, accomplishment and reward, 5) you are owned by the person or company who sells you the drug, 6) it severely effects your ability to travel

Opiate use, put simply, is unsustainable. If it WERE sustainable, you would see lifelong junkies everywhere. Even if you secured a metric ton of chemically pure heroin, which is effectively impossible, you would still not be able to sustain the addiction for a long, healthy life. Modifying your body's chemistry will fuck you in the end due to the body's and brain's ability to adapt. There is simply no way around that.",InTheLatrine,1496061422.0

I feel you. I just got sober and I'm so afraid of falling back into depression and not getting shit done, even though for a couple of years everything went smooth after I found opis. It's just not maintainable and all the antidepressants in the world can't help me the way opiates can. Hope you find a way to cope. 
(I'm not saying that the ugly sides of addiction will fade completely with legalization, but most would, help would be there faster and those who need opiates to function would do so better. maybe. Due to my new found sobriety I'm not sure what to think of all that now...)",GeneralCha0s,1496039070.0
