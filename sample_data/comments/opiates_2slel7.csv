If you dont feel anything, WAIT because it will eventually kick in and the last thing you want is to be puking your brains out or ODing. Once a friend of mine called and said he took a quarter of a 100 mcg patch and he didnt feel anything after 10 minutes and it was a fake. He proceeded to tell me he was gonna do the other half. I pleaded with him not to and told him if you can find your phone let alone dial it call me back in 30 minutes. He called back in 15 and asked if I could pick him up cause he was beyond fucked up. Fent can be very dangerous if not respected. It will jack your tolerance up by doing it this way. Be safe with it",,1421404562.0

My buddy was a gram a day BTH user and got a fent patch. He ended up stopping breathing after smoking too much of it.
