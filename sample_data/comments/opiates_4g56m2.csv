Go to a fucking alanon meeting and worry about yourself. That's what you should tell your mother to do. Xanax is ultimately worse than heroin. If you want to help your mom, tell her to lay off a drug that's w/d will kill her. 

Tell her that you're being safe. If you know the source of the pain that you're attempting to kill, tell her about that. Send her to Alanon. And maybe get some help yourself. Why are you using?

My only suggestion to you is to be truthful in what you say. Hopefully, you'll see the right choice to make. I know it took me a while to find it, since getting clean was the last thing on my mind, because of the shit going on in my life. I just posted about how I OD'd. Now, that my eyes are finally open, I keep thinking about ""what if i died..."" and I can't express to you the amount of regret I'd have for my parents.

No parent wants to think that maybe it's something they did while you were growing up prompted your use. Even if she did nothing wrong as a parent, she will probably feel like she has failed you in some way or is partly to blame. 

Pick up the phone, call your mom, and tell her that you love her and you're coming to visit. Then you can tell her in person. But if you start using again, I can say with 90% certainty that she will have a very hard time trusting anything you say in the future. If you can't see why you've upset her, you're blind.
