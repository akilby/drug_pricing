Since paramedics and firefighters are not really ""law enforcement"" (and paramedics/EMS most likely don't even work for the State), they're just another caller. 

So let's analyze that situation. Law enforcement can act on calls people, including anonymous tips in the right circumstances. First, all sources need a ""basis of knowledge"" i.e. how does this caller know what they are reporting? An identified, known, reliable caller who can demonstrate a basis of knowledge will generate probable cause. 

What about an unknown, anonymous caller? They must certainly have a basis for knowledge, but they must also express what Georgia calls ""an indicia of reliability."" That's fancy appeals court-speak for ""tell us something that says why we should trust you."" I don't recall it's the only way, but it is almost universally a prediction of something sufficiently unique. ""Bill gets McDonald's breakfast every morning,"" may not be, but ""Bill gets a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit, McDonald's dine-in, and he brings a steel briefcase in (that's where he stashed the money to buy the dope),"" probably would be. 

There's a final class called a ""concerned citizen."" These people are not anonymous, and have no real reason to fabricate a tale about the subject. They get a lot more slack than the anonymous tipster, and don't need an indicia of reliability, simply observations reported to police and a statement that they could and did make those observations. 

Hope that helps! Happy to answer questions as always!
