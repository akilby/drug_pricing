I don't solely use it,as my doctor will also occasionally prescribe me oxy or morophine,but I truly enjoy the energetic buzz it gives me. I get the same type of buzz from oxy too. I don't enjoy morphine or dilaudid nearly as much. I haven't had the luxury of trying opana,but if ever given the chance I would love to at least try it although I bet it's probably too sedating for my taste.",spinderella69,1455665834.0

My doc just Rx'ed me 30 Lortabs due to my ibuprofen-induced ulcer.  First time I've *ever* had a physician prescribe me anything this good despite having two chronic pain conditions.  He even gave me the choice between hydro and oxy.  I took the hydro.  ",Survector_Nectar,1455667954.0

Bought a sub strip off a friend, 1mg bupe a day and an Ambien at night after I was out of Norcos. Last day of bupe was yesterday and I feel great.
