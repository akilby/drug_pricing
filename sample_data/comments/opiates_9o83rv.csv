You're probably not going to get an opiate off the street to punch through methadone, not off the street anyway.  Why don't you just get them to up your dose if you're still having cravings?  Cravings are a sign your dose is too low.",DrFeelFantastic,1539568907.0

My benzo tolerance through the roof though, I have scripts and use only once a week probably 6mg and I have never gotten a high of any sort, unless I have some drinks and at that still nothing special at all.",YoungOilRefinery,1539569474.0

Majority of people still dabble for the first months if not years of methadone dosing.  

Coming from someone with 11yrs of using on and off it's not as if I'm going to start mmt and just never use H again.  Trying to take that step in the right direction at least.",YoungOilRefinery,1539568595.0

He said the guy should up his dose a little to take care of CRAVINGS, he just also warned him against chasing a HIGH, which is a very real problem among addicts.
