Hmm.. personally its a tie between IV morphine (bout as clean as drugs get) and IV OxyMorphone... i would love to get a chance at iving opana again ... i dont remember much of how it feels cuz its been so damn long since i had it.. but i remember it was VERY clean",DR0PPA,1542822405.0
ea6g1e7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9z3muu/which_opiate_is_cleanest_and_other_prescription/,t3_9z3muu,Morphine is the most sedative out of all you mentioned. 10mg capsules won’t do much taken orally id boof 2-3 of them to get a good idea of how it feels. Oxy is more euphoric some people find it stimulating but I’m not one of them lol so I can’t speak to that. 15mg of oxy orally is what gets me on 0 tolerance but for a lot of people it’s less/more ,DMVbandz,1542822537.0
