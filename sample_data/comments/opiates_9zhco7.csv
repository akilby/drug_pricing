He seems to like turkey because he races towards it and it disappears when he races off again. I need to clean out his little robot potty because a family of mice has taken residence in it. One time a crow built a nest in my microwave. I watched as her babies grew into fine young birds and marveled as they grew and cried when in accidentally made popcorn one night when TBS had a Diehard marathon. If you count my socks I have a million children joining me for dinner. There are no dead bodies of my parents buried in the basement. Thanksgiving is for family.
