I’m on subs now and had bought them from friends for kicking in the past and I never had any problems. Is this like referring to people who are never not high and are basically just switching over to a state of never withdrawal? 

Every time I’ve ever copped subs, or methadone for that matter, has been during a period where I was running out of both money and dope and knew withdrawal was impending. This includes when I went to the doctor. 

Both times I was assured passionately that I had to wait through two entire days completely clean or the subs would give me this precipitated withdrawal. 

Naturally I immediately cashed any scripts in (or bought them from someone) and took the subs as quickly as possible, disregarding the doctor’s advice. 

The only anti-opiate effect is that I have to wait a full 24 hours until I can get high on normal opiates again, although I have no intention of doing so any time soon.

So do most of you guys get PWD? Never been an issue for me, all the subs make me do is come down a bit, yet feel stable. I think it’s a much better solution to serious junkie issues than Methadone, but that’s just me. If I took, say 120 mg of methadone I would feel as high as I would on a solid dose of Heroin, and it would just be a legal continuation of the problem.

I also have never found that the subs/methadone last 48 as ensured by physicians, even at “stable” doses. 24 hours, if that, and I need another in order not to feel withdrawal. I always wake up needing to take one in order to stave off withdrawal, if it does last more than 24 hours for some people, I am not one of them.",henrydickfinger,1550112289.0

I've been on them for long term and didn't like the way I went through my day. I was only considering hopping back on them because I loved my job so much. I came to the conclusion that I was fucked without residential treatment though, so I resigned later that day. 

Some people do well with suboxone maintenance and I think that's great. For me, knowing that I'm physically addicted, with the substance not getting me high, makes me feel weird mentally and I have difficulty sticking to the program. That may have been different this time, but I'd rather get off all opiates which is my plan. I'm staying off everything for ideally a year, but I'd like to get back to just smoking weed. I'm too old to be chasing heroin everyday, and most of my addict friends either cleaned up, died or got locked up like my best friend. Old junkies exist, but they're far and few in between for sure. Most of them live on the streets too, which I never thought possible but have reached the point where it is. 

My family is well off, but they're done financially supporting my ass in anyway. Detox and rehab is on my own bill, and it's gonna empty out my safety net (brokerage account from my grandfather) that's kept my addiction going and my rent paid. I was spending that money with a job bringing in $8-9k per month average, as I was paid a salary but got performance bonuses based on the company hitting benchmarks. My biggest bonus was $15k pre-tax, and it was the one that really did me in. I had just met a new dealer and boy did he think I was the greatest client of all time. ",SLCmexican801,1550119269.0

good luck on getting clean btw, I've been using for 16 years and maintenance the really the only thing i haven't tried at this point as I've been thru rehab, detox and sober living several, several times and never can put together more than 6 to 9 months. Maintenance scares the hell outta me though, cuz I don't want to go thru hellish withdrawal for 1 to 2 months, so I've never committed to it, plus there are the undesirable side effects.

egg01m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aqdlhj/just_took_my_first_dose_of_suboxone_and_it_was/,t1_egfxi72,"I averaged my monthly income because of my pay structure which I'll explain. I was working for a very young company so paying out high salaries wasn't really in the cards (without making things more difficult), but we were able to pay ourselves bonuses as the company grew. 

I was the 3rd full time employee for a startup that puts on speaker series (multi-date seasons with high profile individuals who rake in $50k-$200k+ per appearance) in select US cities. As I leave the company now, we're operating in 2 cities with a 3rd location being contracted and finalized for kickoff this November. The company is in its second year of operations, and it hasn't yet eclipsed 5 FT employees, but we had some 1099-contracted sales reps in the beginning (who we realized were not needed).

I was the Vice President, and I took a small salary for the heavy workload of typically 6-7 day weeks, 10hr days but always on call (my pay was agreed upon with the understanding that I will be well compensated as the company grows, which was the same for the co-founders who took in more to start recouping their investments). 

My experience is in the financial industry as an analyst in the financial services sector, and then as a VP of Finance at a large online outdoor retailer. I reported to the CFO, and as a 26 year old, it was a kush gig. I fucked up both of those jobs through my addiction, and only landed the most recent through a mutual friend of one of the founders. That founder happened to have a direct connection to addiction which made him very empathetic to my situation, but he was also naive to what substance abuse looks like at its worst. 

I would've lost my job months ago if I didn't work remotely, only seeing the founders/my bosses a few days per month on average as of late. During the beginning and when we were really building things from stage zero, I was sober. I left them in a very shitty position because of how much I handled by myself, so I haven't really discussed what they noticed about my health as of now. I was beginning to suspect that they noticed which was one of the factors in me resigning. 

Back to the pay, my contract had a lot of performance metrics that triggered a bonus as well as equity which vested, both on a typical beating schedule and immediately for hitting performance goals. My last and largest bonus was for $18k pre-tax, and it was in relation to a certain threshold of the second venue's seating capacity being hit. 

I was in total paid 6 cash bonuses and 1 equity bonus that vested immediately. The cash bonuses totaled $38k pre-tax (they were taxed out the ass BTW), and my salary before taxes would've had me at approx. $65k on the year. So while I didn't have $8-9k coming per month, that's what it averaged out to. My most recent employment contract was actually signed last March, so I almost have exactly 12 months to judge off of. I do expect my tax return to give me a lot back from the bonuses, but my $18k bonus only deposited a little north of $10k into my checking account. 

I've had people give me mixed messages about the tax rates on bonuses, but I think that my state tax plus the federal rate on bonuses is near the high-end of the scale. I also know that the payroll software that we used can only estimate those situations so I'm hoping my return will give me back a nice chunk. The effective tax rate on my salary came out to around 23%, so the 44% on bonuses seems outlandish 

Edit: I'm going to rehab (detox first on Friday) soon, so I'm lit as a Christmas tree. Hope you enjoy reading novels haha",SLCmexican801,1550129499.0
