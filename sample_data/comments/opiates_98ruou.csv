Both of those a extended or sustained (ER and SR, respectively) pills that require a specific technique to extract the morphine for instant release.

But,once again - oral morphine is complete fucking shit. So fucking shit that it's not even worth extracting it unless you're playing with needles.",fat_loser_junkie,1534766661.0

SR means sustained release. Morphine has a low bioavailability so boofing it is pretty popular. Crush pill, dissolve in water, then use an oral syringe to boof.
