What your experiencing is a ""nod"", not a seizure. Of course no one here is a doctor, so if your really worried, go the hospital. But personally I think your just nodding off ",spinderella69,1519088351.0

I took like 500+ migs a day for 2 or 3 days straight when i had my first (and only) tram seizure, and had no clue I had even had a seizure until I woke up to emt's in the house...

Granted, i *really* wouldnt suggest trams at all... Was at my parents house yesterday and noticed a full bottle of trams and didnt bother sneaking any.

I'd rather cwe a bunch of codeine.",OlDirtyBurton,1519086803.0

300-400mg is the threshold for being at risk to have seizures. I take it your opiate niave but don't worry about what Google is telling you, I can look up why I have a headache and that shit will try to tell me I have a specific form of cancer lmao. Obviously I'm not a doctor and if your that geniunly worried about it go to the hospital but in my opinion, your just describing what an opiate high is like lol",PillGuyTillIDie,1519091077.0

He said his ear went numb for a few days but that presumably couldve been from lying on it wrong, who knows. May have been a small seizure too he wondered, but he was totally fine. Online says the max daily dose is 400mg so i would say you are definetly probably fine",spacetimeismygang,1519111171.0
