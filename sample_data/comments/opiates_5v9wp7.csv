Totally, that's always been my experience as well. It kinda feels like my heart and soul 'wake up' after a few weeks sober, which is always a really refreshing feeling. *Almost* makes the physical WDs worth it, lol. 

Good luck with being sober, I'll be rooting for you :)",,1487670954.0

Right back ya you got this it's not worth another mental health sacrifice bc of withdrawals, atleast for me. Really dead set on knocking out a bunch of traffic violations and pay my lawyer.

Even though the drug abuse got in the way of the creative process or productivity, he never late the fame or money change the passion for music. Even though his dad was kinda messed up for exposing him to the fast lane lifestyle must've been wild to be apart of that so early. Really what fucked me up is when he took the time to absorb the fact that Hillel died, man that was sad. But honestly if that didn't happen we wouldn't have blood sugar sex magik. Who knows what direction music wise they would've went.",MYNAMEISDANBITCH,1487659908.0

I completely understand the mental health sacrifice, jeez. I can't hold it together - in fairness, I'm a chick so you can make fun of me a little bit less, but the uncontrollable sobbing has got to go and I can't hurt my family or my boy anymore, especially myself. It's time to grow up and do this and let it be. If you ever need anyone, know you've at least got me, and I'm in it with you. For the long haul this time. ",vroomjeremy,1487669448.0

But slowly and surely everything comes back and you start functioning properly. Not to include hurting your loved ones, also do it to improve yourself. You always want to grow as a person and progress more. Not worth it, we are cheating ourselves of good happy lives. Hell I've never traveled outside my country, with the amount of money I spent I could've gone to some exotic island in Thailand. For a month or two.
