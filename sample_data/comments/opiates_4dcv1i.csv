There's no path to guaranteed addiction. You're always playing with fire. But getting burned isn't inevitable. I've used much higher doses with other ROAs occasionally for years and I'm still extremely healthy. ,Bacon_Hero,1459800767.0

But if you love the way opiates make you feel you're going to want to do more. And more. And more. And it just so happens that a lot of people really, really love opiates. And it's easy to build up tolerance and physical/psychological addiction.",,1459800815.0

(almost like taking half a beer to ""enjoy"" once a month) 

Then you might end up doing more and more... I cant see how people get addicted to meth or Coke, but some people can't understand opiates. 

I love opiates so take them compulsively all day every day if I have them, so I stopped for a while, but it's hard. 

It's your call but it's chance mostly.",fuckCARalarms,1459803149.0
d1q5gyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4dcv1i/are_opiates_always_extremely_addictive_even_when/,t3_4dcv1i,"It depends on why you take them, also.  If you have legit pain, it's very possible to stay at the same dose for a long time and still be able to enjoy them for their recreational side effects. 

Also it's important if you're trying to nod or not.  It that's what you're looking for, it's a quick road to increasing doses and pushing tolerance fast.  If you just want a buzz from it, it's much easier to manage. 

Also, rotate opiates. ",Cozywarmblanket,1459820551.0

Completely messed up my life.  Got clean for a few years and now...using a few mg a day again.  So far, so good...but I'm definitely playing with fire.
