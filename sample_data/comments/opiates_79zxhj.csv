However if I tried to take enough to really get me feeling good I just got sick as hell. Puking for hours and hours, dizzy, cold sweats, headache, etc. So at least in my case there was a hard limit to what I could use, which kept it from ever becoming a recreational thing or a new addiction. 


Can’t really answer 3 without knowing more about your habits, but usually I think it’s meant for longer term maintenance than a week. If you were thinking to use it to cushion you through withdrawals, it’s just gonna delay them an extra week",AAAAAAAAAAAAAAASs,1509497116.0

dp6pxyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/79zxhj/methadone_questions/,t1_dp6jwr6,Thanks man me too. My only other option is my friend can send me a fentanyl analogue that he uses a 6 month supply for 60$ bit that is dangerous and will probably end me up in a worse place than I started and could become very bad. He does well with it but Idk if I would,Smew256,1509540362.0
