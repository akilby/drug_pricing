Still wondered if taking a hard hit that makes me cough is bad for the lungs, but I've learned to hit it lighter.. still get high without coughing and I don't seem to cough shit up the following day.",sloan_fitch,1531510499.0

When when active addicts talk about taking a ""tolerance break"", I can't imagine being able to have that level self control if I was still doing opiates. 

A t-break with bud has not been so difficult, any time I've been between work or otherwise broke I felt fine without bud. Sometimes I'd smell it outside and really wish I had some but I didn't feel like I needed pawn something to get it promptly. 

My tolerance hasn't gotten too much lower with a break but it it doesn't get too high even if I did smoke very day for months. The only thing in the past is if I was already high, I sometimes wasn't able get higher despite my efforts to smoke more.",sloan_fitch,1531510401.0
