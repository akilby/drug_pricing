However, this old man I used to buy my roxys from, who basically started me on my lovely lengthy addict journey, SWORE on big glasses of tonic and WHITE grapefruit juice (it has to be 100% from concentrate or else it's not gonna work at all). He would just chug it all day ",kara_t_chop,1502943843.0

Maybe I'll cut it out. There only seems to be one brand at the shops, though tbh I haven't really looked for the concentrate. Does that mean you should be drinking 250ml of concentrate or make it up as per the instructions? ",Euphoriac-,1502946851.0

I use to Mack a cocktail of white grapefruit juice, lemon juice and sprite. Was actually pretty tasty. The grapefruit juice is bitter as fuuuuuck",Egg_salad01,1502949875.0

And yes I agree it is pretty hard to find the right grapefruit juice, but one of the supermarkets is bound to have it. Also check in whatever section they keep lemon juice/lime juice cuz a lot of people only use it in recipes since it's so damn bitter",kara_t_chop,1502951440.0
dlqo84g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6u7hk9/is_it_a_good_idea_to_drink_grapefruit_juice_and/,t1_dlqnvha,Yeah I use the grapefruit juice and tonic water at the same time. They're both bitter and taste like shit separately but for some reason taste ok together. Probably cos I know it's gonna help me get high lol,Euphoriac-,1502950597.0
