cnxftak,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2tb87r/growing_opium_poppy/,t3_2tb87r,I grew some a few years back. You have to grow a lot of poppies for you to get anything usable. Unless you have room were you can grow a few 100 and have the time to properly harvest it all while not looking suspicious then sure it's worth it. Otherwise I wouldn't bother with it. ,Gritsandgravy1,1421952953.0

But that is an awfully long amount of tjme to waste. Youre better off making poppy seed tea.,DopiWonKenopi,1421956186.0
cnxvkjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2tb87r/growing_opium_poppy/,t3_2tb87r,"I've done it the past couple years, but I only had decent success once. They're really not difficult at all to grow, all you need to do is buy some fresh seeds and drop a couple in some peat pellets, then transplant them once they're about 3 weeks old. Make sure they get lots of light, otherwise the seedlings will stretch, fall over, and die.


Other than that, they're about the same as growing tomatoes, but once they reach the cabbage stage, they like to dry out very well in between waterings. Too much water will cause root rot.


Don't bother lancing the pods for opium, it's a waste of time and energy. Dry the pods once they turn a grey-blue color and make tea or eat them.",LeJoyfulMerchant,1421979044.0

You can do whatever with the opium latex. Mix it with booze to create laudanum and whatnots. ",Long_winter,1421961417.0
