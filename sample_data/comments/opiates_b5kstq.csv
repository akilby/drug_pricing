I earned a PhD--and I would want a full 4 weeks clean before any exams of that nature.

Good luck!",waiguoren1313,1553575252.0

I've been struggling for years and yesterday in the same day my best friend AND my 50 year old father informed me they had both relapsed pretty seriously. 

I like what the person said about your brain chemistry is changing whether you realize it or not. It absolutely is, this is one thing you can never see coming until it's too late. You will start to enjoy normal things about life less. Things will become more mundane. 

People get ""addicted"" to things because they enjoy them or they bring them pleasure. Food, sex, achievements. These are natural suppliers of endorphins. Opiates just give you an overload of these same chemicals of pleasure. That's we we like them so much, how could we not. It's literally pure dopamine and endorphins and stress relievers. You're messing up your receptors even chipping, and normal healthy activities even regular socializing will become less appealing. Theres a reason most of us are hermits. It's a dark path by friend, I wish I had not ventured down it but am happy I'm doing okay now (few weeks clean after 1.5 year binge after years of ""recreational use""). I'm also happy to have these insights to help my friends and family but ultimately myself my father and my best friend have all been struggling for years. It really doesn't stop. I watched an incredible speech yesterday I think you should watch. Good luck.

I NEVER dose higher than that and NEVER use consecutive days. Iâ€™m not trying to brag about it at all, but I just donâ€™t crave it in that way. I enjoy it like someone enjoys a few beers on the weekend. 

I feel confident in my self control 100% because I know the risks and know that it can take everything away quickly. I know itâ€™s risky and I know most people would advise against it, but Iâ€™ve been able to do this successfully once or twice a year for the past two years. I never use once a week more than like 2 months straight and even then itâ€™s only half a pill once a week. 

Iâ€™m not concerned with tolerance, Iâ€™m concerned with using 15mg once a week messing with my mind and focus and motivation levels. I donâ€™t doubt in my mind at all that I would be able to stick to my regimen. Just too much on the line. ",curiousjorgecostanza,1553574198.0

By the time we were 30, absolutely nobody did. Now that I'm 40, almost everyone is dead. A few are in jail, and the luck ones are like me, struggling to stay clean. It's a long road to walk. You will carry your taste for opiates with you your entire life now. When you break the rules you have set for yourself about using, you must stop immediately and permanently.
