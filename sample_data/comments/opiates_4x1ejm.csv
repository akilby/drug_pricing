The closest story I could compare to that is when my Dboy asked me to drive him to get his money back and this fucking guy gave me a bullet proof jacket and then headed into this guys house and came out 5 minutes later with a bloody knife and a microwave full of money. you had a far better story, but might as well remember when we lived fast right?",BigKahuna33,1470824654.0

It is kinda funny when he remembers the vest for his driver, but he forgets the black duffel bag (or trash bag) for the loot. Well at least he was looking out first.",Kinda1OfAKind,1470989426.0

This guy I guess is one of the cartel distributors in charge of basically Making sure my area is supplied with cartel dope. So needless to say when he says jump I say how high, he doesn't fuck around. I guess he just stabbed x twice though and then found his stash in the basement in a fucking microwave. I was so confused when I saw him sprinting towards the car with a fucking microwave. ",BigKahuna33,1470836995.0
