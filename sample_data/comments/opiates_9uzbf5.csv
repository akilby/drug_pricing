Sometimes I’ll be high for a few hours and wake up the next day still feeling good with no pains. Sometimes I’ll wake up and feel like shit and need to redose. I would just say play it safe and cool. You can always take more but never take less. When you feel the effects wear off you can go for more, try not to exceed your limit so you don’t build a tolerance that fast, that’s what I used to do.",BabyICE973,1541596723.0
