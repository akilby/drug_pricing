If you do this combo I would suggest, for harm reduction, that you at least have a solid tolerance to buprenorphine and GABAergic drugs. And of course you know the risk, death is possible. Choking on your own vomit if you pass out is a bad scenario that could happen with this combo too.

I've personally have never been hospitalized from GABA B type drugs and buprenorphine but have with benzos and bupe.",SteveOpium28,1486083773.0

Isn't benzos + bupe generally a safe combo? Considering the effects of bupe are mild compared to other recreational opiates. Not to mention I have taken quite large benzo doses with my bupe and felt no interactions.",PlanetDMT,1486248102.0

But yea the LD50 for benzos is pretty high. It would be interesting to find out what the LD50 for a benzo + bupe combo really is but it's probably high too.",SteveOpium28,1486305909.0

It seems that opiates with benzos induces deep sleep. No need for hospitalization however, just slept it off.",PlanetDMT,1486320014.0
