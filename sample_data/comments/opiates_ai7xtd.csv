Hope you enjoy your nod, but seriously, try to space them out a teeny bit or consider performing a fractional crystallisation (CWE) on them. 3250mg isn’t necessarily going to land you with fulminant hepatic failure, but better safe than sorry in my book. 

Have fun. ",Butterfly-opacities,1548057346.0

Looking forward to withdrawals and liver damage. ",throwaway666718,1548057421.0

A while back when I had some 10/650 Hydrocodone tablets, I’d perform a CWE on those each time. It was nuts how much APAP those fuckin thing had. So I’m well aware of CWEs and the liver damage that not doing them can result in, but at this point I just don’t care enough to do it. 

I’m tired of crushing up pills and going through all this extra bullshit just for a measly nod. My preferred route of administration is snorting, and I’m seriously ready to move on to dope, I just can’t find a plug. I came across a bunch of Fentanyl presses 30s one time and it was the best week of my life. Just half a pill would get be rocked. I figure if I’ve done fent I’ve already jumped the line to dope.

Also, insufflating is your *preferred* ROA, yeah? You’re not gonna toot these?? 

If I could think of something that rhymes with “once you’ve done fent, you never go back” then I’d post that. But I can’t. The creative part of my brain is subservient to the cold, hard, analytical part. 

Oh well, that’s my problem not yours. But again, happy nods mate & enjoy your day! ",Butterfly-opacities,1548059266.0

Been about 30 minutes since I took these, and I felt a buzz for a few minutes, but now it's gone. I feel sober again. ",throwaway666718,1548061771.0

I was taking 5g a day for about a year at a point when my tolerance raised before I found other things, I got paranoid and went to the doctor who basically laughed at the thought of that damaging my liver but he performed tests and I was fine.  So I wouldn't worry too much about liver damage if you're young or have only just started doing it.  It's not something to do long term though and anymore and it'll be worth doing a CWE.

Also, try eating a slice of brown toast of something after you've swallowed the solution, it'll help drive the solution through your system.  Not too much though or it'll slow the release down too much.",DrFeelFantastic,1548066963.0
