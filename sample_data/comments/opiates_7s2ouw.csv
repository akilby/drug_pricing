Also tried to put me on oxycodone which I refused and my wife had to stop them from giving it to me. They did give me two shots of morphine which I don't remember when things got crazy and I ended up in ICU. My point is in my chart said in opoid dependency remission.

The one you want is ""Doxylamine Succinate."". (You __do not__ want Diphenhydramine (which is also the active ingredient in Benedryl) because that will make your RLS kick into friggin' overdrive.)

But Doxylamine Succinate knocks you out, no RLS, is non-habit-forming, and just *works.* Just take it as the directions say... you don't have to take extra or anything.

And you can also buy the store-brand... I get mine at Walgreens and it's called ""Wal-som"" -- but that also comes in two formulations, so ya gotta read.

It'll put me to sleep for 5-6 hours nicely, with no grogginess in the morning. If I want to sleep longer just take another one when you wake up.  Sometimes even a 1/2 pill works great.
