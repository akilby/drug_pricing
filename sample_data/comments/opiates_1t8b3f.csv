I will say the occupation conversation came in handy every now and then I think too.

I'll give you both things that could mean doc to me since most commonly people here ask my specialty, even though I think you mean drug of choice.  My specialty is Anesthesiology.  My DOC's (I use them all together) are meth, heroin and fentanyl, all IV all the time of course.  I enjoy MDMA and LSD as well, but very rarely.  My meth, heroin and fentanyl I use enough for it to be a habit, just never when working or even the day before i'm working. (I am fortunate to rarely have to work now because I was worked SO MUCH for so long I could practically retire after 5 years of practice)

It was just kind of like an unlucky coincidence that the drugs I enjoyed the most by far and want to use all the time are the most devastating to most people.  I started opiates 5-6 months ago (started right at heroin, skipped past all the pills), been using IV meth for 10 months.  I can't do opiates without meth because I get terrible nausea without it.  The combo for me is absolutely the best thing ever though with the least side effects so far.  MDMA leaves me feeling like I fried my brain the next day.  LSD is just an exhausting LONG experience.  Weed makes me eat everything in the house and i'd be morbidly obese in no time.",srblows,1387441754.0
