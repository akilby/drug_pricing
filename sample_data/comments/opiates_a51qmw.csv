Construction, 10 hour days and it was so cold outside all day I couldnt feel my fingers or toes. I wore 6 layers on my torso and 5 on my legs and I was still frozen. But. Im making great money, I might not like it now but as soon as i get that that first check it will have been worth it. Speaking of work tomorrow I have to go to bed and I'm going to be setting my phone down and closing my eyes as soon as I hit send on this message. Just wanted to let you know that we're proud of you and we're rooting for you. Keep it up, and good luck :)",skrimpstaxx,1544492381.0
