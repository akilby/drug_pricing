Maybe try some psychedelics or something to help you get some perspective.  I wish that bot would come by and say ""life comes down to moments"" cause with opiates there's a point where you either say no thanks or kinda jump off if you know what I mean.",Phaedrug,1485302675.0

I have no reason to stay clean for 30 days, and if I did I would relapse without a thought. It's this or suicide and ""this"" really hasn't been bad at all compared to the rest of life.",5y64r1t3,1485303838.0
dcv5oln,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5pzm6s/chipping_logistics_help_me_lol/,t1_dcv4u94,Ya I was thinking of eating this apparently weak acid I have but I've been going through severe major depressive episodes unrelated to the dope so I'm a bit apprehensive. I really don't want to stop chipping though. Im genuinely really suicidal and it's one of the few things that keeps me alive.,5y64r1t3,1485303747.0

Possibly at some specific interval or possibly daily.  That's what I did when I finally decided my chronic pain (and depression) were enough to warrant pain management, i.e. taking opiates every day.  Years later and I'm still at the same dose.",Phaedrug,1485304885.0
