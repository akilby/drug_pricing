Itâ€™s brilliant really, I would always lose my vein after adjusting my grip to push in the plunger. Thatâ€™s why I switched to my neck, so I could use two hands (not recommended).",zerebest,1518974312.0

dug7ws7,https://i.redd.it/2l0sdkdvgug01.jpg,t1_dug5xs5,It makes shooting sooo much easier. I see people on here shoot without pulling back the plunger first to make sure they are in..no wonder some people miss so many shots. ,trippygiraffe,1518975980.0
