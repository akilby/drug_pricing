in my experience doctors/surgeons dont really care too much about opiate tolerance in relation to whatever you saw them for. i had a major back surgery in februrary (my second one in 6 years) and my surgeon sent me home with 60 perc 10s. not only does he know that for a year leading up to surgery i was being prescribed a lot more from pain management (he referred me there), my state has a statewide database that he can see what exactly i was being prescribed, dosage, etc... and he still didnt care. i ran through those 60 in a couple days and had to have my girl pass by his office to grab another script. he sent back 45 perc 5s and a note saying ""last time"" and this was after a major back surgery. his justification being ""the whole point of the surgery is to get you well enough to get off opiates. after you recover you should be done."" touche...

if i were you i wouldnt bring up anything unless they ask you your medication history, if youre allergic to meds, etc... then that would be the right time to tell them. even then, all that might do is bump your script from perc 5s or 7.5s up to 10s. frankly i do not see an oral surgeon prescribing 30s in this climate right now. they dont want to bother with the trouble that it could potentially cause. anyone outside of pain management or a long time family practitioner you have a longstanding history with is going to be ridiculously careful.

i dont think they make them anymore but an ideal script for wisdom teeth would be vicoprofren. or duexis + an opiate if your insurance covers it. you need an NSAID. duexis is great. being able to take up to 2400 mg of ibuprofren a day without doing damage to your stomach. if they made a duexis combo with 60mg of IR oxycodone it'd be my ideal pain medication. pill would be fuckin massive though",,1446138944.0

at best you'll be getting 30-45 perc 10s. it'll be tough to bring up your past tolerance, but most likely they will either ask you your medication history (on anything now? used to be on anything? allergies?) during intake OR they will be able to see it in the state database if your state participates in that unfortunate program. conversely though, people make too much of a big deal worrying about getting flagged for being a drug seeker. simply stating you have a history of long term painkiller use and you're worried it may effect pain relief is a valid concern. might be a ""pink flag"" at the worst, definitely not a red flag. but its a moot point. no oral surgeon is going to give you 30s lol",,1446139874.0

My logic behind that was since such a low dose is considered to be standard for that procedure, and he is already prescribed a much higher dose, shouldn't that dose that he was previously prescribed tackled the wisdom tooth pain as well? the perc 5 should be just enough of a boost if he has any issues, combined with his other pill.
