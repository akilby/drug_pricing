The muscles in your gastrointestinal tract (hence difficulty pooping and constipation, since the muscles are tightened and nothing can come out), constricted muscles in your irises (hence pinpoint pupils), andconstricted muscles surrounding your bladder (hence why its near impossible to pee). I'm pretty positive that opiates constrict the muscles not relax em dude. Plus if they relaxed your muscles, then opiates would also be considered muscle *relaxers*. Doi",Rekivk,1395379828.0
