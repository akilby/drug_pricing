1. Clean the wound with Alcohol or Hydrogen Peroxide (either applied directly, or dabbed on with a cotton ball)

2. Apply a clean bandage (bandaid or gauze)

3. Make sure the bandage stays put, and replace it 2-3 Times a day, make sure each time you replace the bandage, to reclean the wound with the Alcohol or Peroxide. 

4. Once the wound no longer looks infected, start a neosporin regimen to prevent scarring or reinfection.

If you see no signs of improvement,if it gets worse, or you start noticing pain, THEN go to the doctor, because you may need an anti-biotic.

No way you would need to see a doctor for a cigarette burns, I promise. They'll just give you a salve and a script for useless antibiotics. ",,1468138798.0
d56ndni,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4s4ly1/please_help_me_identify_nodding_accident/,t1_d56h4ns,Thank you for your reply. I'm more calm now. I was just afraid that the blackish part could be narcotizing tissue. But it doesn't smell or something so I guess it's just a heavy burn. I was just afraid that it's burned so bad that the necrosis could kick in (in that case one should go to doc immediately If i'm correct). ,Mouthpiec3,1468159673.0

Sorry for copy+paste reply, but I'm kinda in a hurry.
