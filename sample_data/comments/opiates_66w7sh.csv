dglwfqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/66w7sh/friend_overdosed_the_other_day/,t1_dglury5,"I'm aware of the danger. If I die, I die. I don't intentionally try to overdose but I've had plenty of close calls. I'm totally cool with not waking up. There's nothing anyone can do about it because I chose to do these drugs and don't care about living enough. 

The reasons behind that are complicated and unique to my own life experiences. It comes down to a choice I'm making to risk life in order to feel good.

I don't want to be around other people when they're dying, so my instinct would be to save someone if they were overdosing. I think it's similar with a lot of people. 

The shit is really addicting too. So, you feel super shitty after you feel good. Physical symptoms, stomach, dry skin, restless limbs, and sweat. Mental fogginess and weird shit. So, you want to do it again in order to feel good and make those symptoms go away.

I'm not sure why young people get addicted to it. They probably had some trauma, physical, or emotional pain and realized that they like it. Perhaps by accident.

 I didn't start using until I was older, out of my drug experiment days. I had much more hope back then though. There's definitely people who gave up earlier than me. I can't speak for others. But I use because it's sort of a passive suicide where I can feel good for a little bit and escape from constant pain and torment that wreaks my body and mind when I'm sober.
