Whether it's getting high or getting sick or both, addiction equals reetition. Others have done better but that's what I came up with. 

The idea came from a Marc Maron joke. For those that don't know, he's an awesome, neurotic, brutally honest comedian (and former coke/booze/etc. addict, now sober) who does the best podcast on the planet, [WTF with Marc Maron.](http://www.wtfpod.com/) Anyway the joke was this:

>[I feel bad for people who've never been addicted to anything. Cause they're the real losers. You wanna know why? Cause they don't know what it's like to really want something. And get it. Again and again and again, until they're sick and have to stop. That's passion.](http://www.comedycentral.com/video-clips/m16eup/john-oliver-s-new-york-stand-up-show-don-t-know-how-to)

He said ""again and again"" but ""over and over"" is what came to my mind and I like it better for this purpose.
