Another time I was taking my dog swimming at the park. I met the dboy at the park so I had like a 1/2 bun in my pocket. Anyway, I was throwing a stick for my dog and she'd swim out to get it, and she was swimming back in and she mustve swallowed a mouthful of water and I saw her go underwater, so I immediately dove in after her, carried her out and whacked her on the back until she spit up the water. She was fine, thankfully, my cell phone in my pocket was no good anymore from the water, but surprisingly the 5 bags of dope I had on me were still good, they somehow didn't get wet! Icing on the cake. 

And just to clarify to everyone, my dogs life is #1 top priority, i really couldn't have gave a shit about the dope in that scenario, but it was a nice little surprise.",TerrrorTwlight,1402245552.0

i got into an argument with my asshole ex bf. i forget about what exactly. i think i was either fed up of the lifestyle we were living or i was mad because he was so manipulative and clingy and i wasn't allowed to go out and see my friends if he didn't like them. obviously he didn't like anyone. he kept threatening to go and kill himself by doing a mega shot and i told him to fucking go for it. at that moment i honestly didn't care anymore and i wanted to find a way out for myself. the argument it just getting worse and he's standing in front of the door like an asshole so i can't leave. I'm crying and pissed off. i go sit down and cuddle my cat. then i hear him out in the kitchen all screaming ""I'm going to do a huge shot and OD and kill myself"" and I'm all like ""fucking great i hope you die"". i go see him in the bathroom and he's got a half gram in the cup. I'm all like ""god you're such a fucking loser, you can't handle your own shitty life so you have to kill yourself"". so i proceed to knock the half gram filled cup right out of his hands. i could see the anger rising in those brown eyes. my recollection gets a little blurry but i remember being chocked and hit and waking up with a bulging black eye and missing a really important job interview.

and the worst part was is that we were selling dope. we had 10Gs. sure he lost a bit of money but its not like it was our last dope. and he went nuts. i couldn't believe the reaction. i knew i was being a bitch but i think i truly knew at that moment that i didn't want to become that type of person that loses their shit over dope and makes it everyone else's problem. he used to beat the shit out of me for my welfare check because he was a few hours sick.

so yeah. probably not the kind of story you were looking for. but i wanted to tell it.",meowforme90,1402243246.0

Was down to my last few bags... already feeling sick b/c i was saving them for right before the band i was in at the time was about to start a gig.  I have social anxiety/stage fright issues and the dope was what I used to cope with that and enjoy playing for people.

So I'm shaky and sick-ish, and using the bathroom at a packed bar.  I'm rushing because we are about to go on and there was no telling when someone else would need to use the bathroom and come knocking.  Plus I don't want the other guys in the band to wonder why I'm in the can fir so long.  I'm getting everything ready to go and have the bags sitting on the edge of the sink with the water running.  In the midst of reaching for my rig I knock all my bags, maybe 5 or so, into the sink and right under the faucet.  

All the bags are drenched and ruined.  I manage to salvage a little or of the bags,  but not anywhere near enough to get my fix.  

Needless to say, it was a tough gig. I was feeling shitty and nervous the whole time and made more mistakes than usual. I made it through though, and no one seemed to notice my troubles but me. Copped immediately after. ",,1402262794.0

Pulling the plunger out too far with the rig upside down on rare occasion sucked, but also transferring liquid from an old rig to new one could be problematic as well. One brand of rig in particular always required a bit of extra effort and timing in making sure the switch went smoothly and you didn't accidentally lose shit. These were mostly just sub shots though, so they didn't really matter as far as an occasional minor spillage went...honestly the most annoying part was probably the sticky hands that followed as a result from the shit getting all over them.",ritchiesrainbow,1402230075.0
