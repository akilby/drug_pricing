If that's the case then why shouldnt  deaths from addiction/overdoses count 


  and again all deaths are counted in the average. . . All this is pointing out is how many people are dying from ODs and that its actually causing the US life expectancy to drop . . . In order for that to happen it shows the scale of the issue


U could say the same thing regarding getting and dying from diabetes, regarding your ""average"" person  comment. .most do not acquire diabetes but alot do. .  . And the fact is many people are dying from overdoses


Again just posted it because I found it interesting. . . But all deaths should be counted imo",squeekykenwood,1513892189.0
