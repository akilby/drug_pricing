Yes, some people can be fine and do them recreationally, but the vast majority can't. Don't be disillusion and think you'll be in the small minority, because most likely you won't be.

just take 1 or two and you should be good with little to no tolerence but if you want my advice just flush them down the toilet and forget you ever even heard of opiates and enjoyed them, once you know you enjoy them you will remember how fun they were for the rest of your life and it will always be sitting in the back of your head how good those little green pills made you feel",chippersan,1467086009.0

I enjoy smoking weed more and enjoy that high more. The opiate high just hasn't been good enough and honestly I don't know if the risks are outweighed by the benefits. Glad to have this perspective though. Was a fun couple of weeks but I think I'll pass this up for not ruining my life :/ thanks. ",eStrong,1467086331.0
