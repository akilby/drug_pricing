cr06wu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3513ao/soft_hair_brush/,t3_3513ao,I have def used a hair brush to scratch my back I actually made a home made back scratcher started out with a plastic fork heated the end so I could bend it to use as a scratcher and attached it to a metal rod that is actually a kitchen knife sharpaner with some tape then cut the fork pieces in half and filed them down some so it dont cause skin damage but my son kept breaking the plastic fork part off and got tired of having to fix it all the time and also wasting plastic forks so I took a metal spoon and attached it the same way to the metal rod and believe it or not the metal spoon actually works alot better then the plastic forks do for scratching even when filed smooth it still hurt to use the fork version but the metal spoon has a natural edge that is just sharp enough to scratch really nicely but not cut into the skin plus its metal so my son can bang it around all he wants and it wont break lol sorry for the long response I am high as fuck right now and talkative never realized that that can carry over to typing lol anyways any one else have any creative creations for itching them selves I am itchy right now and using my home made spoon back scratcher lol nod on peeps ,Bun_Killer,1430919824.0
