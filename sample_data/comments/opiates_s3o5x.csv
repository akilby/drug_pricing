c4av14j,http://imgur.com/LgmAy.jpg,t1_c4auree,"To be fair though(for this context) dicks and I have been together for about three and a half years and the relationship is by no means based on drug use. So I can't really say whether the statement is true, especially because I'm not really a junky(no addiction here), but I can say that not all couples who use together are bad couples or have bad relationships. I guess opinions on that will be based on our own experiences though.. So though you may have your own views on the matter please try not to think that all relationships in which couples use together are doomed. :)",JezzySunflower,1334118977.0

c4avp3v,http://imgur.com/LgmAy.jpg,t1_c4av9kt,"This is true.

 But I think if you're truly in love you find the strength to make it work, even if it means withdrawal and or quitting entirely. I know I took my week of vomiting everything up with every move and feeling like it would be better if I just died quickly lol... but it was worth it to keep things going well with the guy I love. And I know I would do it all again(and again), heck I'd give it up forever right this second if I felt it would aid my relationship. 

Regardless of what is being discussed about relationship, it all depends on the people involved, if you're really in love and you're really meant to be together, you'll find a way to make it work no matter what.",JezzySunflower,1334122821.0
