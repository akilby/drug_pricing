""I was fucked up 24/7 so anything can be a trigger to me, just waking up is a trigger the key is on how you manage those things.""  I'm 6 months clean and come on here on the reg and never really feel triggered.  I guess it all comes down to how far a long you feel you are in your recovery.",Dirtydx88,1498172116.0

I myself can't use but seeing these junkie posts puts a smile on my face. Plus with all the stories and drama surrounding drugs, who wouldn't love reading this sub! I know for some people it was an unhealthy trigger which only increased their cravings so they said peace. ",,1498170372.0

I mostly try to help people out and answer questions so they don't hurt themselves. Opiates were my life for so long that it doesn't feel right to pretend or try to hide from it. 

I would hang out on the recovery sub but it's not so much fun over there. It gets kinda depressing seeing that most everyone there is just detoxing.

dj9u29l,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ix0ce/been_staying_away/,t1_dj9s598,"Well said. I guess right now, recovery wise, I'm naked. I don't have the tools, or armor, to battle triggers really. Some may say I'm ""running away"" from my problems, which may or may not be true honestly. But I know this, had I not moved I'd still be on dope. Only downside to the move, I'm not actively recovering. I'm just sober. ",chowderpuff,1498174461.0
dj9rjdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ix0ce/been_staying_away/,t1_dj9qoa6,"Yea, I'm sure it comes down to personal preferences or something like that. For instance, personally, I LOVE reading everything in here, and I LOVE all the pictures of actual dope, and yes, I do in fact LOVE when the women are kind enough to post their intimate pixx. But problem is, for me, it's unwise. I'm not strong enough, and if I see a picture of some kinky mega babe with a full rig of black...pffff I just wanna jump right back into (it) that pic and hang with her. The heroin that is.  But I digress... I'm sure over time it gets easier/more manageable",chowderpuff,1498171389.0

What's even more depressing is witnessing folk with 1,2,5,15+ years clean all a sudden go on run. Doesn't give much hope when I see those tragedies",chowderpuff,1498174283.0
dj9uc88,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ix0ce/been_staying_away/,t1_dj9u29l,"Man, one of my counselors would have been perfect for you in my rehab.  He always said ""It's time to put on your armor and get ready to go to battle.  Cause this thing your fighting is ready to fight you for the rest of your life and it's a mother.""  He played football for the 49ers so he was pretty intense.  Anyways I would suggest getting into a program asap, walking through the shit because once you get to the other side it is so much better and you have become so much stronger being able to walk through those hardships instead of just using substances to deal with them.  I always find when I have to make amends or own up to shit it always ends up being much easier and not as bad as I thought it was.  As addicts we make up this whole thing in our minds of how bad things are gunna be, what's he/she really think about me, which leads to a shit ton of made up anxiety.  It's tough to start off but once you get that ball rolling dealing with everyday issues in life comes easier and easier.",Dirtydx88,1498174794.0
