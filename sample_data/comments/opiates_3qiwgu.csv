I just make sure I always have money in the bank. I also make sure I always have a stash. I never cop a g or something. I buy in bulk and that gives me time to figure out my money situation way before I run out.

I know it can be hard to get in this flow if you're already stuck in the daily copping hustle. But, figure out a way to start saving. Pick up some extra work temporarily and get your shit on track.

Hope that helps somehow.

P.S. - of course, being prescribed to subs makes all of it moot because I can just hop off the dope train if needed. But this is the way I would operate if I wasn't.",xoperatorx,1446012825.0

UBER & LYFT are super easy to get signed up for. I drive for both, however, I'm never floored out of my mind when I'm logged in and driving other people. I have to do a small amount to get me through the day til I get home. Kinda defeats the purpose for me to be more fucked up then the ones needing rides because they're trashed. I make about 250-300 a week just from UBER and customers tip anywhere between 10-50 bucks a trip most nights. Not my main source of income but it def helps me manage house note, car payment, bills on one source and having a whole different money source for my use.
