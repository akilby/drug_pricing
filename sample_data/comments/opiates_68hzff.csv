Buy a thing of ice cream and have it all to yourself! If your not in withdrawal, I wouldn't use. If your sick though, fuck being sick on your bday.",TomBosley12,1493654666.0

Now I'm so disappointed in myself. I'm mostly disappointed because I actually felt fine physically I just wanted it and made my bday the excuse to use. ",madiolma,1493655386.0

If you have the money, the plug, and a way to go score, by all means do it. Especially if you're sick. No one deserves to be miserable on their birthday. And 2 days isn't hard to make up. If you're not sick tho, then it really doesn't matter. I'm sure birthday sex would be as enjoyable as a birthday shot would be. The only reason I'm saying this is because I was either sick as fuck, locked up, or in rehab for the last 6 of my birthdays. So enjoy it. Or don't listen to what I say, doesn't make a difference to me. I'm going to sleep high as fuck tonight, so everything's gravy with me. ",TheEater_OfDreams,1493599885.0

It may not feel like a gift or celebration but it is. But by all means, I can't fault anyone for using on their bday two days out. ",,1493600019.0
dgyubkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/68hzff/day_2_of_being_clean_buuuutt_its_my_bday/,t1_dgyu4j0,"Yeah definitely not. It's only 48 hours that can be made up easily. You only have 1 day a year that you should be able to do what you want and really enjoy yourself. That's just the way I feel though; I can see why other people would say things along the lines of ""the greatest gift you can give yourself is sobriety!"" But I don't necessarily agree. I think your birthday should be spent any way your heart desires. Again to reiterate it's the ONE DAY a year that's yours. ",TheEater_OfDreams,1493600293.0

Its the one day a year for you to do you.  You only get so many birthdays.


That being said, I hope you're sobriety goes well man. It sounds like you're on the right track. Were those 2 days rough?",VoidDwellerZ,1493604951.0
