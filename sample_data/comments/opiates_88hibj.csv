I appreciate you reaching out.

We have found peace with each other. First we were united in the fight, now we are helping each other to find acceptance.

(Spoiler Alert: Not doing so well on the whole acceptance thing).

I’m sorry to hear your life has been touched in a similar way. I’m here for you, too, if you ever need someone to talk to.
