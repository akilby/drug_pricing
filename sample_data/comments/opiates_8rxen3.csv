I've been on Gaba for 11 years now and it's taken a long time to get up to a huge amount. It helps with the all over aches, I describe it as feeling fuzzy, my mouth feels like it's wearing a wool sweater and teeth don't belong. 1,200mgs in a 24 hour period is a perfectly safe amount to take and can be raised to 3,000mgs and still be safe. 

However, just because I haven't suffered any ill effects (beyond the fuzzy feeling and tinnitus) at these amounts does not mean you won't have any either. Start with 1 pill and then bolus PRN or every 4 hours until you feel relief but no serious side effects.",percstoperkyouup,1529333763.0
