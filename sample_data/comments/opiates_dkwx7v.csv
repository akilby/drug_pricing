I would say smoking weed, but I know if I was sober and smoked some trees I would want some opiates after that. Go see a good psych who won’t judge you off your past, and get some help. I have always been able to deal with the physical shit, but the mental shit is what kills me and that’s PAWS for sure... worst part is depending on the person that shit can stay with your for a long, long ass time. Good luck.",FunLovingFriend4206,1571672564.0
