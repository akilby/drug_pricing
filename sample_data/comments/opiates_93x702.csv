Makes you think things you never knew could cross your mind. You shouldn't be disgusted with yourself, we've all been low before. Your bf at the time should have comforted you instead of just telling you to get a grip and trying to look away, but I'm sure he was in the same boat as you and feeling like complete shit. At any rate, the past is the past. I hope you're doing better now, or at least wanting to do better. I enjoyed your short story! Stay safe! ",Bluesxclues77,1533195330.0

I'm not sure if moment of clarity is what it was more like moment of despair. Just like the whole weight of everything hit me all at once ya know?

Obviously the killing the bf and herself was a desperate, meaningless thought borne from the Hellish state of withdrawal. I'm sure you've been there if you're on this sub, we all have.
