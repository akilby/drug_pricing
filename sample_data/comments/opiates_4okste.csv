He had been getting some mediocre shit. Picked up two points, one for myself and another for someone who hadn't done any for a while. I had just told my friend probably an hour earlier as we were heading out to pick up that the shit usually isn't the greatest.

Cue I am cooking up my point getting ready to suck it up when my friend blasts their half point ""Holy shit, that is strong bro. Don't do that whole thing, jesus christ jesus christ"".

My friend was alright and Needless to say I did a half point instead of a full and was blasted into nodville. Usually I can go through two points in about 6 hours. So that just goes to show you how drastically stronger this was compared to the shit my guy normally slings.

first off, why would the mexicans smuggle fent anywhere? they grow poppy and sell heroin, then people down the supply chain order fent/fent analogues from wherethefuckever aka china and cut it.

second off, if they wanted to, how the fuck would they get the fent? i dont think its exactly easy to make, and its probably more expensive than making heroin, both BTH and ECP

third, why the mexicans? europe in general is pretty far away, especially by boat and not a flight

Ie, ex and I had similar habit. Were together 24/7 for a period in our run so I know he wasn't using tons on the side and I wasn't either. Split our dope down the middle. There would be times - rare but they happened so im convinced this is a thing- when I'd think it was trash and he'd be wrecked, or times I'd be wrecked and he'd think it was trash. Same dope, same bag/s.

Or, I used to middle for this kid super often for several months who had a smaller habit than mine so I'm assuming his tolerance was less especially since when we'd do dope together he did much less usually. Anyways, the dope I was getting at that time was really great and he agreed. There was one day though where the batch had me so fucked up, and his portion, from the same exact bag didn't really effect him much. I mean he seemed high but not as high as his usual dose would get him and he complained soooo hard to me and I couldn't understand because it was the best I'd done in a while.

I'm not saying it's lucrative or a good idea, I merely stated it for the fuck of it. lol funny how you took it all serious even though what in referencing is based in fact even though you were simply unaware of it

Tldr: educate yourself before acting like you know more than them in an attempt to try to make them feel like an idiot.
