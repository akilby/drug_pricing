ce2127s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1sufww/when_did_it_click_for_you/,t3_1sufww,"I love this story:

My parents had recently vacated their old house to move up to the new digs, far north east. While the house in Texas was still on the market, I had unfettered access to a fully furnished, functional house, as long as I didn't royally fuck anything up. Cue ALL THE DRUGS.

The first night I went up there with an aim to misusing my internals, I brought my buddy, L, who was my best friend and consummate drug buddy at the time. This guy had generously, magnanimously shepherded me through weed, shrooms, ecstasy, acid, coke, just about everything. We tried bath salts together for the first time. It was just as wonderful and as gay as it sounds.

In any case, I'd procured a couple of contins, 30's, as a present for a friend who I knew liked opiates. Said friend was an ass to me, so I decided to keep his presents for myself. L, my companion that evening, had been vociferously anti-opiate up to this point, as he was always an uppers guy, and hated feeling sluggish and trapped inside his own head. My only prior experience with opiates was while recovering from wisdom-tooth removal, when I took them as prescribed and didn't think about what effect they might having on me (gimme a break, I was a good kid in high school). 

We arrived at the house at 11PM, scooting over from work. I unlocked the front and we quickly ascended to the nest, the upstairs bedroom that ran the length of the entire house, culminating in a massive floor-to-ceiling, east-facing window. I'd arrived earlier to lay out blankets and music, as well as a few toys (not really knowing what I was about to experience, but being a bit of a rave-kid at this point, I assumed any pill would make me happy and light-showy. OH HOW WRONGLY THE WRONG ARE WRONG SOMETIMES).

We sit around for a minute debating the best way to take them (one pill apiece), and settle for breaking em in half, swallowing half and chewing the other half. Bitter taste, icky powder in mouth, not as bad as tabs, we get over it in a few minutes and sit around, listening to some TV On the Radio. L glances over at me, as if to say ""Man, see, I told you"". I wave him away and stand up. Rather, I try to stand up. Gravity seems to have increased exponentially in a very localized area, specifically around my knees and shoulders. Then it hits me. I do mean hits. This...wave of sensation bursts outward from the pit of my stomach and fells my other senses with single callous backhand, sending me towards the floor like a severed marionette. I wind up on my back, gasping slightly, staring at the ceiling as my pupils contract down to about micron-width. L crawls over to me, similarly unable to get all the way to his feet. We manage to make eye contact, and as we concomitantly light our cigarettes, just manage to breathe...""whoa...I...whoa"".

We didn't move the rest of the night, just lay there, buried under an indeterminately large layer of thick, rich, oozing, custardlike satisfaction. His girlfriend found us the next morning, surrounded by spent cigs, fingers loosely twined in each others' hair, grinning like a pair of retarded lotto winners.

I'm told that all of your using career is spent trying to get back to the start: to reclaim the magic of your first real high. I don't know that it holds true, but fuck, there's a lot I'd give to have that night again.",,1387082148.0

This is the absolute truth. NOTHING has ever fixed me up like opiates have. Xanax takes away that butterfly-stomach fear, but it doesn't make me feel warm and fuzzy, like everyone is my friend and I can just say whatever I feel. It sounds so melodramatic, but opiates are the best thing I've ever discovered, nothing has ever mad me feel so good, so normal.

Wellbutrin pulled me out of catatonic depression, Nuvigil helps keep me awake(have obstructive sleep apnea), and I'm on Celexa to help even me out, but I don't notice it making much of a difference.

I used to have awful digestive problems, they thought it was IBS until I was 13 and my intrusive thoughts were getting so bad that I couldn't function, and I finally went to see a psych.

Found out that I had GAD + Major Depressive Disorder, I remember my first panic attack at age 7 when I fucked up a pitch during baseball in gym. I never knew what they were until I went to that psychologist at 13, always thought they were allergy attacks. Opiates fix literally everything that's wrong with me and turn me into the person that I could be. I wish there was some kind of non-addictive medication that acted the same way opiates do, it's like a switch is flipped and all the circuits that are connected wrong are realigned so everything works.
