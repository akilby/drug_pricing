I'm 22 as well and i too am clean and living with my parents. I've only been clean 6 weeks but i feel you bro, i don't hang out with anybody these days and socializing is feeling pretty difficult. I just got a job though so that's something i can look forward to. but yea the whole living at home thing sucks cuz my parents are pretty rigid and uptight people and i always feel like i'm being watched over. Then again I was homeless for 3 months before this and that was way worse. at least i could get high though lol.",alwaysintosomethin,1481257386.0

Just a thought...also maybe attend some meetings so you can at least have a social hour with fellow addicts who are your peers ya know?,denverdman,1481234756.0
