They'll not be moving at all and their skin will lose color, and they won't respond at all to stimuli or being shaken. If they're just nodding heavily you should leave them alone unless they're in a dangerous situation. If you see someone who you think has overdose and they won't respond to being shaken or to loud voices, do a sternum rub with your knuckles on their breastbone. If they don't respond to that, whip out the narcan. 

Thanks for your concern. I wish more non-junkies cared as much. ",FashionablyFake,1498615804.0

If they still won't wake up after all that definitely time to call 911",chillbroswaggin69420,1498619147.0

djhwtm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6jxjrv/how_can_i_help/,t1_djhr83x,"This is obviously not a substitute for narcan or anything else that has been suggested in this thread, but I used this technique once in a crisis (where no narcan was available), and it was successful in saving a life. 

I knew that the GV 26 acupressure point can be used in cases of cardiac arrest and respiratory distress, so I actually just poked that point several times with a needle (obviously nearby) while doing the sternal rub that she described here. It worked in seconds and kept my friend with me long enough for paramedics to arrive. 

It would be helpful to know that technique, OP, especially since there is some concern that narcan is going to become very hard to get. Just as a backup ""Hail Mary"" type of thing, you know?

Here's a better explanation of GV 26:
