I never really mix though because every single time I do I get the WORST migraine ever after like one beer. Its horrible. If you start getting a headache it means stop drinking.

I have a huge tolerance but mixing opiates and even a small amount of alcohol will make me puke. ,fistpump,1431144967.0

Cwe is NOT 100% efficient and the amount of drugs you lose is probably not worth the very little damage 975mg of Tylenol would do to your liver to lose the hydrocodone in most people's eyes. In the interest of harm reduction though its always good to cwe, but in my personal opinion its not always worth it.",msdonnaA,1431224652.0
