dhlyu09,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6be3d1/has_anyone_ever_tried_ambien/,t3_6be3d1,its like a kinda pyscadelic benzo. One of my favorite drugs tbh. definately smoke some weed with it and it kicks right in. I find 20 mg to be too much and just fall asleep. The first time i tried it i took like 15 to 17 mg sat there and smoked some weed like half hour later and i looked down and the grain in my wood floor was swirling and flowing like a river. It was so cool and not like a fleeting hallucination i sat there and stared at it for a good couple minutes. You can send them to me if you dont want il safely dispose of them for you,455_R4P3R,1494898474.0
