We found that grey death shit once and made a gram last for a week split between two people because it was so fucking strong... I particularly had a decent tolerance (5 or 6 old school oxy80s might get me feelin niiiice). When we were buying grams elsewhere we could kill one in a night if we werent busy. Despite how scary that grey shit was, i miss it terribly... saved so much money.

These days we are in a spot where dope is sold in bundles and on the WORST day we need at least 3 buns to be happy. We can survive with one. Not sure how many buns equal one gram but I guess i should try and find out. Definitely at least 2 or 3.",Chupacabraonfire,1528761805.0

Its annoying. My old dboy was tryna tell me at first that each bun was a gram until i offered to get my scale out. Dont fckin lieeeee. I know what a goddamn gram feels like.
