I would think that if a batch came out more blue than green they would fail quality control and get dumped. Maybe that's how they were acquired though through some quality control scheme. While I think that's far fetched... who knows lol .. ",MrMelt,1483029972.0

All the A's (Not Activis A215's or 4's) will change color when wet which explains the discoloring before even doing them.

I bet they just used too much blue dye/powder.  Ive had 15s that looked slightly blue before. With all the presses around lately thought I would have been a little worried too

dbrdrb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5kxj7d/super_confused_about_a_potentially_fake_oc/,t1_dbrd92u,"Thank you.  That picture is intriguing though.  The ones in your picture seem to look more blue-ish then the ones I've seen on the internet.  Is it possible that they turn slightly greenish-yellowish if they were to get a little wet like the other commenter said?

Because, aside from my sentence in my OP about my booger, I noticed one of them has a slight greenish hue to it, almost as if it responded to a little bit of heat or moisture.  Similar to how checks change color if you blow warm air on them (although that is far more of an extreme/noticeable color change).

Thanks again for your response!

That is actually what I was fearful as being an indicator that they were fake.  Everything I'm hearing so far has been really good news.  Thank you very much.

I'm not sure what causes this but it is factual. This is the case for the 15 and 30mg ones,  but only for this manufacturer. Also if you snort them they almost have a flour (to me at least) taste to them right away but still has that Oxy chemically Taste when it drips. I am SUPER anal about fake pills and log any fake ones and characteristics of real ones that I check when I get an iffy pill. 

Also as a side note I have never seen fake 15s and have the same logic as you.. why would you take the time to fake 15s when you can fake 30s and make double the money. It's like, why fake a $10 bill when you can fake $20s.. ",MrMelt,1483035319.0

Like I said, I'd consider myself to be pretty darn good/knowledgable when it comes to these things... this time around I just wanted to be sure.  You all have been SOOO incredibly helpful.  I really was not expecting these responses, and I am extremely grateful.
