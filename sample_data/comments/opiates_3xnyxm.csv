I relapsed upon getting home from the whole rehab halfway thing. Got caught right away. Kept relapsing and getting caught. Idk what else to do. I fucking love getting high,jesuss_son,1450682845.0

Vivitrol could be a good option, or even oral naltrexone as long as you have some accountability with taking it. You have to continue working on yourself now that youre back in the real world, whether that is therapy, 12 step programs, or whatever else. You have to keep moving forward or youll end up right back where you started. ",JuicyJay,1450686114.0

I know at the end of 30 days or whatever on vivitrol you can get high but it's much more difficult. If I go on subs I would need like half of one a day yet I know I'd probably end up doing like 2 strips. It's also much easier to use a few days a week on them. ",HansBrixxx,1450710555.0

I was just saying that's how I feel and was curious how others felt. But I'm not against others going on it. ,HansBrixxx,1450721758.0

cyapskc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3xnyxm/sadness_at_the_end_of_a_runrelapse/,t1_cy6t108,"Hey man, I have been on sub maintenance several different times, including multiple years at once. Let me know if you ever want to chat about it. 

The short version is that it can be very helpful in enabling to get your life back. The things you lose when in active abuse. Relationships, career, healthy habits, etc. These are all very important things that give you a sense of hope that's necessary to achieving sobriety.

But in the end, you will eventually want to get off that shit bc it'll likely start making you depressed, as it's a daily reminder of your addiction. And when you get there, DO NOT go to detox/rehab IMO. That's what I did and it fucked me up. When on subs, I went years without even thinking about getting high because I wasn't around any users or anyone that even talked about it for that matter. Going to detox to get off subs years removed from active drug abuser put me in situations where all everyone talked about was getting high. This replanted a seed in my mind that made me want to get high again after I finished getting off subs, which I did and then released harder than ever. 
Hindsight is 20/20 but I should have done a medically supervised taper and worked with an addiction psychiatrist rather than jumping into a junkie-filled inpatient treatment facility.

Best of luck to you my friend.",opiaccount902,1451019756.0
