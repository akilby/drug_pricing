So put the dope on the full side, burn the shiny. If you really want to be careful about it take your lighter and burn the foil on both sides to burn off some of the chemicals an whatnot. Than put a small peice of dope, start very small, like head of a match small. Have your straw in your mouth while starting to bring the lighter under the foil and start inhaling when you see smoke. Try inhaling slow but very consistent so you can actually get a hit. New users make the mistake of inhaling very strong very quickly so they get these tiny hits and end up wasting a lot of ther stuff. Try starting small with the hits you take as well, only bring the lighter under the foil for a second or two until you think you have it down well enough that you can take fat rips without wasting much. Will let you know if I think of anything else 

Edit: sorry your going through all that man, sounds rough. Defnintely sounds like you need to stay away from the needle for a bit though. Good luck with everything ",thrawy24,1460954178.0

I really appreciate you giving me such thorough advice to follow. I had some really kindly loyal junkies teach me to shoot back in '06, and their kindness has only been matched by yours now, ten years later. Wishing you the absolute best,

I get tar, but it's hard.
I mean, if I leave it in my car, parked on a spring day it gets soft, but when i pick it up its, tarry . . .",Pitseleh21Oct2003,1460952145.0
