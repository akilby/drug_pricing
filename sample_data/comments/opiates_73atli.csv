If you're within 2 days of your last sub dose after using H, you'll be fine to dose as long as the subs are still in your system. If the subs are completely out of your system, then you would need to wait another 24 hours after using H to dose your subs to avoid PWD.",theOperentice,1506720547.0
dnozv75,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/73atli/need_help_with_dope_and_subs/,t3_73atli,You have to wait until you feel wd to start back on the sub. Even then you should wait a little longer. Every body iabdiffernetso can't give you a time period tho 24 hours is a good gauge. ,Dammit234,1506723851.0

dnpozlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/73atli/need_help_with_dope_and_subs/,t1_dnp0864,Yes - you're right. Forgot about the sub that could remain bound. Sid I read that switching back and forth like that could reduce effectiveness of sub? ,Dammit234,1506773320.0
