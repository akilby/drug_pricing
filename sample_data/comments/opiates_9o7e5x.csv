e7rz4ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9o7e5x/kratom_strains/,t3_9o7e5x,I love Kratom. It fills my need for opiates lol. They say Bali is the most opiate like. I’ve been using super indo recently and I think it’s the strongest one I’ve had without being an extract. Try out a green first it’s a mix of red and white. Red is more sedating white is more energetic.,unckledoor,1539559508.0

Any red strain is a good start, but red Bali or red Maeng Da are my go to. There are multiple reputable online vendors I can vouch for. It took me awhile to dial in the strain whilst finding a reputable vendor. Send me a DM and I can help you avoid months of trial and error.",bancorrupt5,1539572067.0

Also, since you mentioned Valium...do you think or have you encountered pressed valiums. I know they’re pressing Xanax and oxy’s but what about Valium?",Slut4blood666,1539576991.0
e7shqt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9o7e5x/kratom_strains/,t1_e7sgil6,On the onion patch (dnm) I have encountered pressed Valium. I have tested every pill I encounter on dark net sites. Any one that seems pressed has had Valium as the only ingredient. But in person I make sure I take a look at the prescription. If I can't be provided that information I just do a quick search on the web. Drugs.com is a good start. On dosing info I use PsychonautWiki or Tripsit. ,bancorrupt5,1539578609.0

e7zadf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9o7e5x/kratom_strains/,t1_e7z642k,"It's completely possible and has happened to people (getting pressed valium) that doesn't have Diazepam as the only ingredient. Some have had etizolam and diclazepam from what I've read. Just look for the right color and consistency of the structure that makes up the tablet, such as taste and how brittle or tough it is to chew or snap in half. Also look for a shine or gloss on the outside,  that's a good place to start",bancorrupt5,1539835135.0
