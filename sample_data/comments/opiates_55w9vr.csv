I just recently started taking Subs and am on an outpatient program, but I didn't know much about the Subs before I started...

Apparently I am in for a hell of a ride when I inevitably try to taper and detox off the Subs, which already have me craving something I can't have - more than I did before I started on the Subs. I could get through the Oxy withdrawals and stay clean for a bit on my own before, now I am scared to detox off Subs. ",TheLuxGeeen,1475622388.0

Been watching vice and taking it easy. That methadone clinic will see me again tom. ",DietVicodin,1475623775.0

I've been in withdrawal with Percocet but I woke up this morning feeling like I would jump out of a building not to feel this way. It was on another level. ,DietVicodin,1475623570.0

Some Trazadone I've got left over from my time at IOP is helping me sleep and I'm taking a B-12 and 500mg vitamin C twice three times daily. 31/M... withdrawal is way nastier than it used to be, wasn't expecting this.
