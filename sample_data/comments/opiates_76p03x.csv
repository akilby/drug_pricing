The problem is, you can only take a certain amount before you start having seizures. I think 400mg is the MOST they recommend taking a day. I just used it in between times where I was broke and couldn't get anything so I used some old tramadol I had stashed away. It did help. But this was before I had the massive tolerance I do now. I don't know if it even would stop my WD anymore. ",Colie45,1508141576.0
doft0sc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76p03x/has_anyone_had_any_experience_using_tramadol_to/,t3_76p03x,I love tramadol. Very underrated IMHO but I believe it's like codeine and works differently in different people. Just got to watch the seizure risk.,coffeencreme,1508154592.0
dog67bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76p03x/has_anyone_had_any_experience_using_tramadol_to/,t3_76p03x,Sounds great doesn't work. I usually use tramadol to taper off of oxy. Sure it staves off withdrawals but then I go overboard with the tramadol and end up having to withdraw from that too. Tramadol withdrawal for me is worse than oxy withdrawal. Tramadol has an antidepressant property which leaves me with super bad depression and suicidal thoughts on top of regular withdrawal. Tread carefully.,Genieinabottle94,1508172048.0

As soon as u stop taking them the withdrawals come right back.",dillygirl00,1508172407.0
