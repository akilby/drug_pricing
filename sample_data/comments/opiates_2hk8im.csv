Paradoxical effect it is called. I get it with valium. It makes me super chatty and up for over 24 hours. ,,1411861047.0

cktfqlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2hk8im/benzorelated_question_this_gag_reflex_tho/,t1_cktflfv,Hmmm thats weird. I could see them making you gag if you had a drip or something but Ive never heard of benzos doing that. You might want to try the guys over at r/benzodiazepines they might have a little more info. The only thing I can possibly think is happening is youve developed a mental reaction associated with taking benzos but Im by no means a medical professional. ,tripleoverhead,1411765738.0

I think subconsciously you're not totally ok with your use and this is how it's manifesting. If there are things you're putting off or negative consequences to your use, correct those areas and make taking drugs something you do as a happy reward for fulfilling your obligations. Or I could be wrong. I only gagged when my life and home was a mess, and taking a drug that had negative consequences in my life. I believe certain people should stay away from certain drugs, and it's up to each user to determine what those drugs are, if any.",Deelia,1411813061.0

It feels like my stomach tries to purge itself whenever I try to take a bite of food or smoke a cigarette. Very strange. 

Maybe they're just not for me, but besides opiates, they're the only thing that helps my anxiety. ",joshualeet,1411769416.0
