All I can say is, after experiencing Oxycodone, would such a high - better than you can possibly imagine render you to throw away a lot in your life to stay high for however long the remainder of it might be. 

Personally - doing 1 oxycodone won't get you addicted - it's deciding to do 5+ in the span of a week or two - herein you might become psychologically addicted. I see you sold it - maybe that's the best choice. Statistically speaking 20% of the people who use opiates regularly go on to become seriously addicted - you may be part of the 80% or the 20% - is this gamble worth it to you? 
Keep in mind tho, do not gauge the majority of users by what you see on this subreddit - herein are for the most part those who are part of the 20% or on their way to be shortly - I am there myself, although none of my friends are - go figure.
