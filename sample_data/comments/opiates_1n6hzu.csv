ccftsv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1n6hzu/so_i_just_took_the_plunge_for_the_first_time/,t1_ccfssm7,"Yeah that's my guess. Maybe it slipped out a tiny bit at the end, or his hand was shaky at the end and it slipped out of the vein. 

And yeah I never take the tie off until after a shot either lol, unless its on a small vein near where the tie is. That happens rarely though. I have veins I can hit in the dark lmao",GourmetPez,1380211638.0
ccfwyhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1n6hzu/so_i_just_took_the_plunge_for_the_first_time/,t1_ccftsv9,Yeah that sounds about right. I was nervous as all hell and it's gonna take some time to get the hang of it. It was harder coordination wise than I expected it to be. I had to go to work pretty immediately after so I couldn't do much more than hit it with antibiotic ointment and a band aid. It has since gone down and now it's a little red spot.,Crackronite91,1380220376.0

This has happened many times. Try using short tip needles  5/16  , they pretty much hit perfect when pushed in all the way. Just keep the rig as sideways as you can when booting up , youll get better at it.",sterling831,1380226946.0

I know I shouldn't do this but I have a habit of finding a spot I can hit easily (and naming it ""ol' faithful"" heh) then using it every time I fix (a few times a day) until it just stops working. I don't know what happens medically but I won't be able to draw blood from it no matter how much digging I do, the veins basically dead. 

But what always amazes me is just how quickly it will recover. If I leave it for a week it will normally have a healthy flow of blood going through it. 2 weeks it will feel more 'full' to the touch, 3-4 weeks or more and it's feeling like it used to, nice and spongy with no hard spots etc.

I've just had my evening shot so I'm rambling a bit haha, I guess what I'm trying to say is it's really important to rotate your spots, it'll help keep your veins in shape / stop tracks from showing big time :) ",NoddingKing,1380235378.0
