I have almost a month clean, but I have noticed a considerable spike in my alcohol intake. (Btw congrats on your upcoming year clean, kicking opis is still kicking opis) The thing is, I hate alcohol. I put myself in more compromising situations when I drink than any other drug, and I justify it to myself because it's legal. But oftentimes addicts will cross-addict. Kick one thing, tiptoe into another. Opiates will always be my DOC, but it's like I need a buffer between myself and reality. It sucks. ",_Oasis_,1472462432.0

It inhibits dopamine reuptake so it might help with PAWS / the need for alcohol. Congratulations on the sobriety from opiates, if you want to ask about the wellbutrin feel free to ask.",AleisterAiwasCrowley,1472476834.0
