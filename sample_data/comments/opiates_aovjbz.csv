 2017. I had about 5 years mostly clean off heroin (only used 4 times in that time) and I slowly felt myself slipping like you are right now around September ... by April the next year I was using daily. Got another 4 mo and I started slipping again last September , lol maybe that’s not a good month for me. Now I have no money, no car, no job, everyone hates me (again)... so be careful. If you can stop it before it gets too bad you will be a lot better off. Sounds like you like your job and where you live. You don’t want to lose that. ",FettyFattyDillyDally,1549741202.0

As of today I have almost exactly 1 year and 3 months sober. 100% of everything the entire time. I left north Philly and ended up in the bay area California somehow. It's been pretty good for the most part. I mean i have never been sober this in my time on the planet. I'm not a huge fan of the ""program"" even though I go. I'm a black guy from the street in North Philly and I'm living in this affluent county. I've gotten back into school and things are slowly coming together for me. But I feel so outta place here it's crazy. And I don't have very many friends at all. It's basically just school work, self study and video games. But that part of missing the hustle rings so absolutely true. I knew how to survive even if I was living on the streets. My only major concerns was hustling and getting high. Granted I've been on suboxone this whole time but I don't feel like I am made for a normal life. Like I've been doing it so long it actually defines me at this point. Every day lately I've just been holding out on hope alone. I remember that last emotional bottom and don't really want to feel like that again but I'm also not really breaking through either. Idk I wanna get high but not for the feeling but to destroy this facade I feel I'm living and go back to where I belong. Idk man this is a shitty feeling ",Rise9X,1549773235.0

Way easier to just hustle, get pills, repeat. I feel like im not meant for a normal life either.

egel46v,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aovjbz/i_miss_the_hustle/,t1_eg74ysq,Yeah I'm the same boat with you guys. A friend of mine suggested making a gratitude box. And every write a few things that you are grateful for and put it in the box. When I asked what's the purpose of the box she said so when you open it everyday to put your little note in you can physically see all the blessings ,Rise9X,1550087651.0
