dwbvj7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/87ckuf/urine_test_question/,t1_dwbtu40,Yeah thats what i heard by searching the internet. 3-4 days. Damn gonna be close. It was just one evening of fuck up. Probably 4-5 8mgs for a few hours and that was it. Fingers crossed ill let you know how it goes. ,Throwawayaddict1983,1522099113.0

dwbw31e,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/87ckuf/urine_test_question/,t1_dwbvr1b,Yeah spread out over 10 hours or so. Its weird i always needed more of the instant release ones even when i wasnt on subs. Crushing up the time release ones seemed twice as strong. Only could get the shitier instant ones tho.,Throwawayaddict1983,1522099634.0
dwc5mqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/87ckuf/urine_test_question/,t1_dwbw31e,Hey quick questions! How much sub were you taking daily when you slipped? And how diminished was the dilaudid for you by the sub?,jayyyyyyarghhh,1522109379.0
dwc5ywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/87ckuf/urine_test_question/,t1_dwc5mqr,Ive been on 12mg for 5 months but usually got by with 8. I didnt take any subs for like 18hours before the dillies. Id say it felt like they were half strength. I still got high but needed like 16mg of the d’s and it wasn’t quite as good as i remember. Im back on a solid 12mg a day now and don’t plan to repeat this. Im honestly happy on the subs so i cant explain how this happened. ,Throwawayaddict1983,1522109723.0
