But to me it's like nature's suboxin it doesnt give me euphoria like h and oxy but it makes me feel good. Some people get euphoria from it but I'm a long time heavy drug abuser I've been using opiates and weed since I was 13 been addicted since 19 or 20 and I'm 27 going on 28 soon.

Are u taking any new meds other than opies now that could interacting with ur opie buzz? What about diet? I find a good high fatty meal right after or a little b4 ingestion helps wonders with increasing the good opie effects. Try a big greasy burger and fries with em next time. ,Suddenrush,1507975921.0

I shaved down an op 20 one time and railed it it clotted my nose and after 10 minutes my nose had snot like slime stringing out and I didn't get a buzz. If you have anymore throw them in some coke(about a quarter of a bottle) and let it dissolve for about an hour then drink it all down that's the best way I've found to get a strong buzz from them.,Optimistic-angel1,1507975995.0
docoee4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76ar6q/some_weird_shit/,t1_doco1xq,"NAPP brand eh? I take it ur in Europe somewhere then. U guys still get the good old OC imprint oxycontin while in the states ours have changed formula and are basically made of plastic and cannot be crushed even with a hammer it will not crush, just smoosh down a little. They are garbage and do not absorb for shit either and basically 20mg OP (our shitty plastic version in the states) equals to about 10mg OC because the OCs are def the gold standard of oxy pills. I would try using a hose clamp with those OCs next time. Go to ur local hardware store and find a hose clamp that is big and wide enough to rub a pill across the little gradients, the slits in the hose clamp. Just wind the hose clamp up until most of the metal band is sticking out and then bend the curved band straight so u can rub the pill sideways across the grades (lil metal slits). Make sure u are rubbing it across the inside of the metal band slits and it will turn that lovely pill into a nice fluffy pile of powder that is so fine u will be amazed at how it even possible. Just make sure u take the coating off the pill first, doesnt hurt to leave it on but it less bs going in ur nose. Just rub it with some a wet cloth till the pill is completely white and then dry it with a dry cloth and it will be good to go. Those pills are rock hard and can get wet and will not dissolve quickly at all. But a hose clamp or some other fine grade grater will do wonders for the good OC imprinted pills and u will wonder how u ever sniffed ur pills b4 using one. Hope that helps.

dodfl6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76ar6q/some_weird_shit/,t1_dodc0ep,It's all according to how much you use. There's people who used 20 to 30 grams a day and said it was worse than quitting a 200mg daily oxy habit or a gram a day h habit. If you can keep yourself down to 10 to 15 grams a day it's rough but more of a lack of energy but the body aches aren't as bad. If you can hold your use down to 5 grams a day an energy drink and coffee will carry you threw the worst of it. But everyone's different this is just my experience.,Optimistic-angel1,1508017265.0
