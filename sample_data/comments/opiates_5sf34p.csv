I personally have very mixed feelings about the effectiveness of rehab.  I went to what was supposed to be one of the best facilities in part of the midwest and it didn't do anything for me.  I received very little one-on-one attention, and ended up relapsing very quickly after leaving. 

I am not saying this is the fault of the rehab, but I just don't know how effective it was for me.  Left me with huge medical bills and really not much to show for them.  I never felt like they really even came close to piercing the real issues with me.  I kind of got the feeling that I just walked away with a bunch of recovery slogans and one-liners to say.

Just make sure you follow through with your recovery and give it your all.  Make sure that you get everything you can out of rehab, because you never know how many shots you'll get at this.",OpiateScript,1486407834.0

ddeutut,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5sf34p/rehab_update/,t1_dderqhm,"Rehab definitely isn't for everyone. Some people thrive in that environment and with that degree of institutional support and some don't.

I'm a fan of the idea of detox facilities, though--treating WD symptomatically and providing medical monitoring and treatment that allows someone to get themselves through the process. It is irritating to hear experiences like OP had, where the treatment of symptoms was completely minimal, though! Defeats the entire purpose, in my mind. 

There are other benefits to the idea of a medically assisted detox - having an IV for hydration and electrolyte balance, for example. 

I'm a fan of comprehensive protocols (such as [this one](https://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca/locations_services/Services/mhas/Documents/Resources%20for%20Professionals/Opioidwithdrawalprotocol-finaldraftJan14-2010_000.pdf)) that focus on symptomatic relief (though I would add certain benzodiazepines and gabapentin to their arsenal, as well as ondansetron (zofran) for nausea.)",DJHF206,1486411401.0

IME the most relief comes from Gabapentin / Lyrica, magnesium supplements, massages, Epsom salt bath, sauna and cannabis ; although obviously not all of these methods are available to you. 
RLS was surprisingly rather miserable to deal with, all things considered. Stopped me from sleeping, exercising and getting any resemblance of relaxation.

I have been to 2 separate detox facilities; one used the correct amount of comfort meds, the other gave you practically NOTHING and it seriously seemed like they enjoyed watching people suffer.  

Not only was there a huge religious and AA/NA backdrop to this place, the nurses almost seemed evil.  They would say things like ""The pain you are going through is the cost of your addiction, so don't forget it"" and basically what amounted to ""You deserve this pain because you're a degenerate"".  Unfortunately, it's that pain that often drives us users back into relapse and ultimately death.  These places should keep us as comfortable as possible and not try to make us suffer.
