Just deal with the discomfort...if it doesn't go away significantly after two weeks..then get em to up your dose. You don't wanna be on 32 mg of sub amd try to kick from that.

I mean especially if you were only using less than half a gram a day.

When I first started kicking H I started methadone and for about 10 days I had excruciating anxiety..upset stomach..and ached. I kept myself to only 10 mg (some days 20 mg but mostly 10) even though everyone told me to use way more. I was using half gram a day to be well and up to 2 grams to get high plus taking Oxys pretty much daily. So I had a decent habit going...

And you know after that first crummy 10 days ten mg of methadone keeps me all good now.


Good luck",agreeswithevery1,1413344582.0

You're not going to be 100% so stop aiming for that. You'll still feel plenty uncomfortable. Or at least I do. Just tough it out. Are you working right now? If you're not even working then you should definitely be toughing it out. ",,1413350238.0

I def did NOT feel good but I was able to work. Now if/when I get off methadone it'll be kicking from a fairly small habit.

My gf uses 100 mg a day as a pain patient (she gets 180 thirty mg oxy a month too but doesn't use very many) ..I've seen her when she is out of methadone and it's not pretty at all..in fact it's horrible.

I've run put of methadone for three days at 10-20 mg a day and by day three I felt pretty wretched and pukey...I don't wanna know how,it feels to kick from high doses",agreeswithevery1,1413344847.0

I'm doing better tonight. i really feel like everyday i feel a bit better and I've been able to cut down on the dope today. hopefully ill be able to cut down more or stop by tomorrow. i want this to work, i just have trouble handling my anxiety. the physical symptoms have gone down and hopefully it'll be better tomorrow. i do still crave drugs so i think i might ask to go a little bit higher on sub.",meowforme90,1413351352.0

i couldn't imagine being in your situation holy shit that takes a lot of balls.",meowforme90,1413345312.0

Feel anxiety? then take a walk, Depressed? Start doing something, anything, wash clothes, clean, go meet some friends. You must be part of the solution, taking a Sub and waiting for the world to be right will take you the rest of your life. If you decide to say fuck the walk and other stuff then you just don't want it bad enough. It takes effort and hard work. No way around it and no short cuts. ",mahituna,1413750988.0

If you really want to change then you need to suck it up and stop being a little bitch about this. You're gonna feel kinda shitty no matter what. And you don't even have to work dude. Whenever I'm sick I still have to go wait tables. 

And every time you go back and do dope you're just making it that much longer for you to actually feel normal. It might help you right now but it's just gonna make it worse later. 

Get some xanax and knock yourself out for a couple days. Obviously you have very weak self control right now. ",,1413352897.0
