My main objection has to do with the massive amount of filler and flavorizing chemicals that are in one of those things.  Until I see a source, I am going to have to call bullshit on 25% BA given the fact that I've been on it for years, and have actually had IV Bupe before, which seemed to be equivalent in effect to the sublingual administration.

Actually, I just did a simple Google search, and more than a few sources say sublingual BA is > 50%  (even Wikipedia says it for fucks sake).  Sorry to burst your bubble, but you really need to provide citations when throwing out numbers like that.",noddin_all_day,1347254323.0

Because I sure can't find one, even on Wikipedia which you claim says so.






And it goes on to say that intranasal is 70-89%.





Other sources I've read in the past have said anything from 25 to 30 for sublingual, and around 60 for intranasal... so even if I got the numbers off by 10 percent, the difference is still **twice as much** taking intranasal vs. sublingual. Maybe before making attacks you should read the whole thing.






The naloxone in the bupe doesn't do shit. Snorted, injected, whatever. I've used all 3 ROAs and never had a problem.





You've had IV bupe before, and it seemed to be ""equivalent in effect"" to sublingual administration? How do you figure that? Do you have a meter attached to your body that tells you? If you're basing it off how you ""feel"" as far as a buzz, that is irrelevant.




So... we have sublingual 35-40%, and intranasal 70-89%. Are you ready to admit you're wrong now, or are you going to continue to try and ""burst my bubble"" by providing sources that prove my point?
