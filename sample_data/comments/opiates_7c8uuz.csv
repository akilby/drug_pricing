I can't speak for anyone else but personally I did heroin for the first time when I was 12-13 years old and I had no idea what I was getting myself into until it was too late. Once you do strong opiates, especially if you are predisposed to addiction, the knowledge of how it feels never goes a way and even if it takes weeks or years it almost always snowballs until the habit is a lifestyle. Weed is the love of my life even throughout my addiction and recovery and relapse I smoke almost everyday but it's not satisfying like it used to be and it's hard to explain but that high compared to opiates is like weed high compared to being sober.
