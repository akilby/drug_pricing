My best friend has been recently diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer so u knocked own exactly what your going thru.  I'm so sorry.

I can't imagine anyone Dr that will with old pain meds from her at her late stage in the game, so to speak.  Don't stress out about something that hasn't happened yet, I know easier said than done right?  I would just wait til her appt and see what happens.

If she us denied pain meds then find a new fucking Dr.

Please let me know how it goes.",NWOPIATER,1531016205.0

I told them I got out of jail the night before and I was in for 10’days and I went in with nothing in my system and they restarted me at 30mgs. They just verified that I was on maintenance prior and that’s it.

And FYI, the methadone sub is full of cool people and they specialize in this bullshit so I would crosspost it over there to.",Smokemctoke420,1531016841.0

I don't really know of anything else that would pop positive for mdone, but I would bet that if you go to the nearest mdone clinic (very early in the am, since they generally open and close stupidly early), someone is likely to let you buy one of their take-homes. Especially if you explain the situation to them as you did above. I hope things work out for you. I honestly can't imagine any doctor cutting someone in your situation off, though in the current climate I'm sure it happens. That seems like a cruel and unusual punishment, and should be considered a violation of the 8th amendment.",Rushing_on_my_run,1531020922.0

I’m really sorry your best friend is in the same boat, it’s an awful, awful disease.

I will for sure post an update and let you know what happens. 

Hoping you’re right about the doctor situation. Right now she’s freaking out, which means I’m freaking out. 

Oh, well, if we had better coping strategies we prolly wouldn’t be addicts, right?

e20chdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8wy5x7/methadone_question/,t3_8wy5x7,Theres nothing she can take and remember methadone has a really long halflife and stays in your system for awhile as an everyday user so whatever story she goes with she has to make sure she doesnt just say ive been out for a few days. If its a really big chance of her getting cut off by the dr and youre in a city goto the police station and file a police report saying that someone stole your bag off of the bus or something that had the pills in them. I did that once with a valium script and showed the dr the police report and he wrote me a new script and just told me not to take them with me again. I just told him that if im out all day i have to bring the bottle because its illegal to carry the pills in anything other than the bottle,Thatguy131313131,1531068267.0
