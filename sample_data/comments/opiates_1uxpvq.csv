I mean I couldn't get further than the phone call to a sub dr. Mostly they all wanted $350 - 450 for the first visit and then weekly visits that cost around $100. My insurance doesn't cover it. 

Who can afford those prices? 

Not I.

I guess the subs allow you time away from being high.  I don't know. It feels like a more venerable racket,,1389489138.0
