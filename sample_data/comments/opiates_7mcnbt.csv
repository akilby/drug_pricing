drteeja,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mcnbt/just_odd/,t1_drt4gnh,"Narcan/naloxone isn‚Äôt a binary switch, it‚Äôs effects are dose-dependent and good EMTs/ER physicians give patients enough so that their respiration and oxygen saturation rises, but not so much that they are in total precipitated withdrawal. It is best practice to keep an opioid overdose patient as comfortable as is possible. There are EMTs and physicians out there who immediately push a large bolus dose of naloxone  as some twisted form of punishment for being a drug user. I find that practice unacceptable and instituted retraining in my ER, using a response-based rowing method that saves lives without to prevent unnecessary suffering. Do know that the majority of physicians are not out to inflict pain on people, it‚Äôs just a subset with certain ego problems and character flaws.

The reason we try to get overdose patients to stay at the hospital is that naloxone has a shorter half life than most opioids. This, when the naloxone wears off, there are still opioids in the bloodstream and they re-bind to the receptors and can cause overdose again depending on plasma level. This is particularly dangerous when a patient leaves against medical device and goes to use more heroin first-thing‚Äîthey don‚Äôt realize how much is still in them and that the combination of their existing levels of opioids and the addition of a new shot likely puts them back in overdose range once the naloxone wears off and vacates the mu opioid receptors .",DJHF206,1514381412.0

After having open heart surgery to replace the valve I destroyed because I gave myself endocarditis, I knew it was time. I had my husband as a support system, and that helped, but most of the work is a solitary fight with your own mind. 

The relief you feel from shooting up is nothing compared to the relief of waking up and not being scared about where your next dose is going to come from. I‚Äôm not a religious person, so God wasn‚Äôt going to save me. I have a degree in psychology so therapy wasn‚Äôt going to save me either. I had to save myself and once my mind was made up, I found a way. Methadone just traded one addiction for another and I leaned on that too much. Subs weren‚Äôt used widely yet, so I can‚Äôt say personally how well that works, but lots of people have used them successfully. 

When you‚Äôre ready, dig in and dig deep. The other side means so much to me. Because I have lost both kidneys and I have cystic ovaries and gall stones along with sciatica, I do remain on a low dose of oxycodone and OxyContin. My husband locks them up in a safe and doles them out daily. I could take the key and open the safe but I‚Äôm not willing to break that trust or return to finishing a prescription in four days. My doctors trust me again. My family trusts me again and nothing feels better.

drv1uel,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mcnbt/just_odd/,t1_drteeja,"thanks doc, perhaps you didn't notice my username. I too have a medical edumacation.  naloxone/naltrexone are as close to binary as it gets.  it all depends on the binding affinity of the opiate in question. the dosage is irrelevant if the binding affinity varies too greatly, like sufentanil.  good luck with your tiny dose of naloxone to make sure you don't cause any unnecessary suffering (free tip: you wont, the patient will be dead).

my sister (who's a paramedic) and I just had a good laugh about your comment that 'good' medics/EMTs/physicians give some..... actually we laughed at the whole paragraph.  Not sure whereabouts you are, but nowhere that either of has worked have we seen sadistic doctors or paramedics taking pleasure from  (excessively) narc'ing a patient (and hoping that they go into withdrawal).  I'm not sure how you come to draw your conclusions about the motives of these alleged malicious health care workers... but my guess would be that it's due to the extremely high potency of fentanyl, carfentanil, and all of the fentalogues.  I'm really not sure what you find unacceptable about saving lives.  Do you know that your 'response-based rowing method' is a massive risk to the life of the patient?  If you have a cyanotic patient who is unresponsive WITH a GCS of 3, I'm jamming them with IV naloxone/naltrexone.  I'm not worried about their comfort so much as their heart dying.  I love that you call it ""my ER"" btw, lol.  Do you know how long it takes for an oxygen-deprived brain to start taking potentially irreparable damage..?

I'm going to stop taking shots at you, and assume you either didn't read my username or didn't take it seriously... and that that is the reason for you attempting to explain things as if you are talking to a layman.  yada yada 2nd paragraph technically correct.

I'm also going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you are a doctor, although this method of administering naloxone/naltrexone is really sketchy.  I'm curious as to whereabouts your hospital is, what the demographics of the area are, and if you're in the heart of a big city, in the suburbs, or a relatively remote location.  I'm also curious as to the socio-economic status of your overdose patients... to see if I can establish any sort of trend for my research.",NewDOConTheBLOCK,1514470639.0

I generally do not read much into people‚Äôs reddit handles so I would have no way to know that you‚Äôre a physician from just your username (is that what you‚Äôre implying with Doc? Or are you in a different field? (Doctorate of Nursing, for example?) Also, it surprises me that you would take offense at someone explaining something (even if you already know) as I have no way to know that, and comments/replies are visible and read by everyone. More information is a good thing and I‚Äôm sorry if that offended your sensibilities, though I remain at a loss to know how I could have known any different given that we have never spoken and do not know each other. You can keep your benefit of the doubt, I‚Äôm just a username and random person on the internet and regardless of my profession, what I say should not be taken as medical advice.

The ER I spent the most time working in was in a major east coast city, millions of people, urban area. The hospital was situated near lots of housing and more slum-like area to one direction. We would often see patients that were less than a block or two away from the hospital when they needed help (which in many cases was phenomenal.) 

I have nothing against saving lives‚Äîif a patient is cyanotic I‚Äôm going to give them a solid dose of Narcan. We would see dozens of patients who were essentially just nodding out and really only in the neighborhood of respiratory distress. Naloxone dosing is *always* ultimately symptom-based, assessing their oxygen saturation and breaths per minute and other vitals (and the changes therein) to assess the effectiveness of a previous dose and determine if more is needed. I don‚Äôt understand the aversion to this idea or practice, its basic and standard. We don‚Äôt just push the same single dose size for every person and hope it works without observing their vitals or response.

Also, I want to assure you that I was not saying that I assumed malice was motivating the practices of certain emergency responders, I was relaying what they said. I worked with these people daily for four years and would constantly hear the opinions of my peers and of the other emergency responders that would bring patients to my hospital. And on that topic, I don‚Äôt say ‚Äúmy ER‚Äù or ‚Äúmy hospital‚Äù to imply ownership or anything like that, simply to refer to the hospital I worked at and be the responsibilities I fulfilled in that role. I don‚Äôt understand what is funny or strange about that unless you thought I was being literal and claiming I owned a hospital (I was not and do not.)

Anyway, it‚Äôs usually a pleasure to meet and talk to fellow medical professionals in this sub and I hope that will be true of our conversations in the future!",DJHF206,1514609412.0
