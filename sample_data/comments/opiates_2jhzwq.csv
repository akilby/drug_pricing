Eat something if you can, and try to rest. If you're getting anxious and nervous don't sit still and think about it. Get up and take a walk, or do something around the house. That always snaps me out of the paranoia a bit. If you can work out, do it. **Take a shower and force yourself to eat, even if you just need to down a milkshake or something first.**

Take some Benadryl if you have it. You'll feel worlds better after sleeping and eating. I know it's scary but you have to just go for it. If you keep staying up you won't wear yourself out for a long time. If you really must wear yourself down to get some sleep, don't do it sitting around in a room thinking about all of this. Get outside, get active, and then get your ass in bed. Remember that what you're feeling isn't terribly abnormal, and it WILL stop once you can get some rest. It's gonna be alright. PM me if you want to discuss more, I'm almost always up. ",ScaredTodayThrowAway,1413558409.0

This is a lot worst though. I've never had a problem with paranoia, and now all of a sudden 3 different nights in the past week I've ran into it. And by paranoia I don't mean ""worried"" or ""playing it safe,"" I mean, like legitimate fear. Fear and panic that at any moment the cops are going to bust down my door and arrest me...that was the other 2 times when I had a weird combo of no sleep, meth and some dank bud (I rarely smoke weed anymore) and oddly enough, half a suboxone. 

Now its not about the cops, it's about something intangible. Something I just feel is there in my room. Also my door handle is still being turned and sliding about. How are my eyes seeing this shit?",for_tits_and_giggles,1413536938.0

I mean, I know staying up that long isn't good for me; I don't expect to feel like a bouquet of roses lol. I know I should feel like shit. I actually don't feel that bad now, though, been smoking h for the past couple hours. I felt like absolute dead shit this morning though, dragging myself around from class to class. I felt exactly like I expected to, though, how I felt every other time I did the same thing and had to be going around to classes at 10 in the morning after working like a maniac through the night and popping all together over 200 mg of vyvanse. 210 to be exact I think (this time). 

I did this quite a bit last year, and I'd always feel like shit, but I never saw the level of hallucinations I am still seeing. However, Id usually pass out by now. I don't think I ever had h to soften the comedown, so by noon the exhaustion, hunger, dehydration, nausea from the those 3, aching from chewing in my jaw and tenseness just *everywhere*, plus the come down, which is basically just additional pain, additional pain everywhere lol, would pretty much leave lying down in bed as the only thing that didn't cause even MORE pain by moving, and then nature kicked in and I was out. This time I had h though and the hallucinations freaked me out and kept me awake haha. are keeping me awake. ugh its almost 2:30",for_tits_and_giggles,1413537952.0
clbxiui,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2jhzwq/hallucinations_in_your_reflection/,t1_clbx9g6,"I'm just really curious about why now. Do I just have the prefect combination of vyvanse and g lingering from a couple days ago (idk if thats even possible)? Did I finally push myself to the edge? Do I have a bad memory and did I use a lot more vyvanse than usual? How much of it is the drugs and how much of it is the lack of sleep? Does high stress levels and working literally the entire time I've been awake contribute?

I'm trying to remember the longest time I stayed up. I've stayed up through the night a lot...But often I will have waken up at 5 in the evening, so I didn't really stay up that long. Or I pull an allnighter and pass out before noon. Sorry. I didn't mean to barrage you with questions you can't answer.

clbxqm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2jhzwq/hallucinations_in_your_reflection/,t1_clbxl9a,"41 hours now. Which doesn't seem that long. I think drugs and stress might be playing a big role.

I had 2 midterms today. well technically yesterday. thursday. one in the morning and another that was an online test and an essay due online by midnight. So I've basically been working nonstop until 2 hours and 50 minutes ago. I worked like crazy for 38 hours. I was way behind for both tests and they are, like, decide if you fail or not tests.

The morning one was more important though, so I studied for that one all wednesday and then literally all through the night nonstop and up until 15 minutes before the test started. Got home afterwards, and jumped into trying to not fail the second shit.

So I've been stressed. These 2 days especially, but the past 4 days at least (about these tests, I mean). I haven't eaten since Tuesday or showered or anything. well technically I've had some bits of candy cuz I don't like the taste of h so I eat em when I smoke lol

Edit: So I really couldn't fall asleep before midnight. after I finished my second test and turned in my essay, I needed to try to unwind for a bit, smoke some h, relax. But then I started hallucinating and shit. I went from nodding out, almost out in my chair, to sitting here typing away furiously like I was 12 hours ago.",for_tits_and_giggles,1413539896.0

I get auditory hallucinations and visual disturbance/noise (like mid-dose mushrooms or LSD) when I am tired but also continue doing opiates.

Stims + 41 hours awake + H = what's happening to you right now. Drink water and stay hydrated please, and go to sleep as soon as possible. I recommend ceasing your drug intake until you wake up.

If I'm tired, it helps me fall asleep, if I'm stressed, it relaxes me, if I'm sad, it lets me forget, if I'm hungry, it makes me feel full (which I know is bad, but often convenient lol), if I'm coming down from any drug, h so far always helps, etc. 

I think I'd be even worst off (mentally, I mean) if I had no H. You don't have to answer if you don't want to, I'm just super curious now...I've never meant someone like that.
