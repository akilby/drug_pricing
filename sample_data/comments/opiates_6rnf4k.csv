for example, in oxycontin 10mg IR, that is the dose delivered upon ingestion and depends on the body's metabolism to distribute the dose over a period of time (this is why half-life matters..) the dose is potent and short-lived.

in oxycontin 10mg ER, there would be an initial dump of 10 MG released upon ingestion and then 10 MG is released with the dissolution of each layer of the tablet. 


(this is also why ER/XR formulations tend to have a higher dose.)

I hope this helps, its a bizarre concept and I remember a bit of a struggle wrapping my own head around it in school...

XR/ER pulled because the active ingredient in extended release formulations is designed to release a consistent dose over 24 hours--ingesting the tablet all at once leads to a skyrocketing in both the potential for addiction and overdoses.

XR/ER dosing is maintained by a microscopic wax matrix in the tablet; as the tablet is subjected to a.) gastric acid and b.) the mucosa of the body site that metabolizes the drug in question, it is dispersed by dissolving in layers--drug, wax matrix, drug, wax matrix, drug, wax matrix...and so forth over 24 hours.

Edit to add: You're brave for admitting you're a pharmacist! They don't always get a good rap around here - at least the ones that dispense a dose of their judgment along with the medication.

luckily I was prepared for that exact response and handled it accordingly, but I got here because I wanted to see what harm reduction experiences I could find regarding intranasal naloxone kit possession for active addicts. 

word in the pharmacy world is that those kits  will be switched to IM soon--I hate that because its way too many steps when you're saving a life and most people have difficulty with prepping a syringe out of a multidose vial when they're sober, let alone being the terrified and panicked (and possibly high) guy sitting next to an unresponsive person.  

I'm afraid for the consequences of that switch.

and thank you for the very kind welcome :) I'm a pharmacist, not the moral police, and I stand behind harm reduction all day every day. we cannot arrest and incarcerate our way out of this and we cannot judge our way out of either.  

what you guys have here is invaluable and I'm grateful that it exists. aside from completely defunding these egregious pharmaceutical companies, this is the best way to approach this stuff.

I've got an interesting perspective because I started in pharmacy pre-opiate crisis and my first job was as the lead narcotics/controlled substance pharmacist at a level 1 trauma hospital in a major U.S. city. I watched the unfolding of this crisis and was ass deep in narcs during what I describe today as the DEA'S Little BitchMaking of all careers in healthcare--practically every position in any hospital now has some sort of DEA meddling going on. I watched Purdue Pharma's aggressive pushing of Oxycontin and I have a fairly complex narrative of what I saw and what I experienced and what I know to be true regarding the opiate situation. 

I'm glad that you appreciate my standpoint--please know that I'm not alone and I hope you can find comfort in knowing that there are colleagues of mine that also see the benefit of harm reduction. as this crisis widens, more and more of us folks in white jackets are stepping up and standing behind harm reduction efforts. stay safe out there--fentanyl has changed the game and will continue to put the country on her knees. its gonna get worse before it gets better.
