Especially if you've been drunk, or have a hangover the next day. Those days are the toughest. That's largely why I don't get drunk anymore, I know all the hangover pain can all go away with just one cop. I'm so proud of you for staying strong. That took SO MUCH willpower. Feel free to vent as much as you want, as often as you want, if it will help you stay clean. Everybody has those days. Expect them to last up to 6 months. But they DO become less frequent. It's called having bad days --even sober people have them.

Stay strong my friend. ",invinciblecb41,1530487420.0

It's been exactly 3 years this month since I stopped (except for 1 slip up) and I still get cravings. It's all mind over matter but even though I get cravings I wouldn't trade my life now for anything. It gets better but you have to take it one day at a time and it seems like your doing great even if it doesnt feel that way. It took me two months to feel somewhat normal again. Keep up the good work, you got this!!",SandSnake21,1530487937.0
