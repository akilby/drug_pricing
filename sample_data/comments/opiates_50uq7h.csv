It shows the struggle that all of us go through,  It also shows how much a user's health deteriorates and the lengths we go to to get a fix.  

Really interesting, and emotional documentary.

Seen one based in New York too,  can't find it now but didn't find the people as likeable as in  the black tar heroin docu.  it truly showed the volatile relationships, prostitution and even thieving and scamming to get fix.

What i like about Jani is his big capacity to still enjoy life and I guess that has lot to do with him being on subutex as opposed to h or methadone.

Also I would have loved to have seen the uncut sequence of him shooting h for the first time: Did it really blow him? 

Where are they now? would be also nice to now.

Alternatively you could get methadone or subutex from the blackmarket with good chances of not being scammed.
Heroin at that point just becomes pointless. Too much of a gamble for me. I used to buy methadone for that very reason.\
