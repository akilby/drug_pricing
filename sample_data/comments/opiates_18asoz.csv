It's nothing to be ashamed of though, many of us who IV have these same struggles. Anyhow, I'd say it's definitely in your best interest to get on methadone. Do not get on a high dose though, get on just enough to be feeling normal. Also try to not stay on it long, the quicker you get off the better. But quitting is more than just getting off opiates. You need to change many parts of your lifestyle to insure you don't go back. Best of luck",Noddingham,1360572187.0

My eating disorder being the biggest along with really bad anxiety. Life doesnt seem manageable without opiates. It might sound like a cop out, but I feel like its true. I dont know, im just depressed and opiates are the only things that make me slightly happy. At least with this program ill be able to get my shit straightened out. Thaanks for your concern though.",dextromethorphansand,1360577921.0

I totally understand life feeling more manageable on opiates, but from the paragraph you typed up it seems to me that opiates are causing most of the turmoil in your life. I understand having anxiety too, but opiates aren't a permanent fix to that. There's medicine made for that purpose and therapy that can help you solve it nearly permanently. In the long run opiates will only make coping with anxiety more difficult. I don't have experience with eating disorders but once you clean up, or atleast get on maintenance you can begin to put all your attention into healing that.
Trust me, all us junkies wish we could be users until the day we die, but the truth is it will almost always become unmanageable. It will eventually implode, and it sounds as if it's already giving you problems. Your best bet is to get out now, because it's only going to get harder to leave as each day passes.",Noddingham,1360587011.0
