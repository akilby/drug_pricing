Naa I get what you're saying - it starts off small, and with an injury that grants you access to the lower strength painkillers. From there it escalates to heroin from a needle. Same old story for so many people really. Good watch. He's an interesting cat that one ",Completelyshitfaced,1502621041.0
dlkgz3o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imWmJadj1NY,t3_6te81p,"seen it.  Phil Anselmo is such an intense dude.  He's so matter of fact, that he comes off as humorous, when maybe he doesn't even mean to be.  

He's very in your face..  I love the way he talks.  It's almost indescribable until you watch him speak for yourself.

For anyone who hasn't seen this or doesn't know Mr. Anselmo (the lead singer for the band Pantera) this is a must watch...

He is speaking at Loyola University in New Orleans to a bunch of college kids about his history with heroin addiction",viledenial,1502646863.0

I knew he had drug problems, but when I was young I just thought it came with the territory of being a famous musician. The more I learned about his story and what happened to him and why he used made me like him even more. Not for using but, making me realize no matter how big and famous you are we're all still humans and hes just so humble about the whole thing.",Opiophille,1502682572.0
