d214spd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ekt9d/i_was_arrested_and_bonded_but_never_heard_of_it/,t3_4ekt9d,"Lawyer here. It definitely is possible to fall through the cracks. When your dad's lawyer says you are ""not in the system"" what he probably means is that your name doesn't come up on the criminal dockets. Virtually every state has online records of all arrests and criminal prosecutions which are supposed to be public record. Everything from felonies to speeding tickets should show up. If your name isn't showing up on the state records that means that there probably is not any criminal prosecution which is going on. 

I know it sounds bizarre but these things happen. Our justice system tries to portray an image of omnipresence and invincibility (to scare people from committing crimes) but the fact is that it is still imperfect. It is entirely in the police and DA's discretion as to whether or not they will pursue a case. Cases are dropped all the time, sometimes without explanation. Sometimes cases are never even really pursued because of some kind of mistake. Maybe your charging papers were accidentally thrown out. Maybe the cop who was in charge of submitting your case to the DA retired and doesn't give a shit (that happens with retirements sometimes). Maybe someone reviewed the facts and concluded that the search and arrest wasn't legal and decided to say fuck it. Maybe someone fucked up royally and lost the evidence and drug screens and now they don't have a case. I know its hard for people to grasp but if you work with the justice system you'll see that although things like this are rare, they certainly do happen and they can happen for all sorts of reasons. 

My best advice is to NOT do anything to stir the pot. There is a statute of limitations to these things. Assuming that this is a result of some kind of error you definitely don't want to do anything which will risk them realizing their mistake and then going after you. However, it is the job of the police and DA to prosecute these cases in a timely manner, and if they fail to get their act together in time and move forward with prosecution the statute of limitations will toll and they will be shit out of luck (in law school we memorized the statute of limitations by abbreviating it to SOL which means both statute of limitations and shit out of luck because once it tolls you truly are shit out of luck). Usually the statute of limitations is about 2 years or less with these things, once that period passes there is nothing they can do. In the meantime you definitely don't want to take any action that will risk them moving forward against you. Going to a lawyer in that city would be a waste of time because any lawyer worth his salt is going to tell you to do the same thing your dad's lawyer told you, which is to do nothing and say nothing and wait out the SOL.

I know that its frustrating dealing with the uncertainty and ambiguity with a situation like this. I have clients all the time who have to deal with this kind of stuff and they often have a very strong urge to want to step in and try to figure out what is going on. But trust me, sometimes you don't want to know what is going on. Any satisfaction or relief you may gain from finding out the truth is not worth the risk of being prosecuted. Just let the clock tick down on the SOL and then maybe you can try to find out what is going on. 

As for the internet article, that does kind of suck. But I don't think that means you will be prosecuted. Like I said, the ""system"" is not nearly as smart as they would like you to believe. There's a good chance nobody from the police department or DA's office even read your article and even if some of them did, they probably just assume your were charged and prosecuted. Keep in mind that cops and prosecutors are very busy people and they deal with crimes far more serious than yours, even in a medium sized city. No do-gooder whistle blower is going to waste his or her time looking up your case to see if their colleagues did their job right and then lobby for your prosecution over a fucking low level drug arrest. Cops are just like any other working man and aren't going to go out of their way to their bosses's or colleague's jobs for them, especially if its something menial like a drug arrest. 

That being said, if you open your mouth and start bugging them then they just might do something. So listen to your dad's lawyer and keep your mouth shut. 

There are ways of clearing up your search history for your name so the article doesn't show up, it's not always cheap but it can be done. Shit, if you just talked to the radio station (or had a lawyer talk to them) they might just take it down, though you may want to wait until the SOL runs out before trying that.

As for changing your name, it's not too difficult, usually it just involves walking down to a place like the marriage license office and filing a form and it's usually quite cheap (though changing your name on your IDs and financial stuff is more of a pain in the ass). But changing your name and taking on a new identity may be overkill, unless you really don't like your name and were planning on changing it anyways. ",throwwayout,1460555867.0

They might bring it up later but if you're SURE you weren't arraigned, the clock is ticking and you could get away with it. 

There's also a decent chance they'll realize and send you a summons. No way to tell, keep checking through a lawyer for warrants, and in the mean time STAY THE FUCK OUT OF TROUBLE!!! catching a new charge would increase the likelihood of them realizing their mistake by a lot. also if you don't get in any shit and don't have much of a record they might just not bother with it if they realize their mistake. 

but yeah, it does happen, I'm sure you heard about the guy who was supposed to go to prison, but the prosecutor said ""oh we already have him in custody"" when bail was to be ended, and the defense attorney just didn't speak up to correct them. well they didn't realize their mistake until it was time to release him, and he had gotten pulled over etc during that time and never had any trouble until then. 

so when they finally realized their mistake they try to make him do the time, but the judge was kind and said, well since you haven't gotten into any trouble, are an upstanding member of your community etc, we'll say you've been rehabilitated, and he ended up not having to serve it. sad part is they tried to frame him later, I'm guessing because the cops and DA were pissed about their mistake, and he almost went to prison again, but he had video evidence that he wasn't there when the crime was committed.

The best thing to do is just keep quiet . Not sure what the statue of limitation is in the states but here (UK) it's 364 . If they don't take you to court in that time they need to drop it . I know a guy that got off with murder because of this his case was a right fuck up ! And he was released from remand. 
    One time I some how managed to rack up 13 deferred sentences each a 12 month summery and I was still at Liberty . I ended up getting lifted for TWAC and got remanded for 3 weeks when I went back up the judge was bewildered as to how I managed to get so many charges and still be free . The judge said "" I'm not trying to say Mr ******* is some sort of criminal mastermind but how has he managed to amass so many charges and still be at his Liberty ??? "" and the whole court room burst into laughter ! There was so much paper work and stuff I was sent back down the stairs till the judge sorted through it . 
          I went back up about 30 minutes later and he read out some of the charges theft ,shoplifting ,prescription fraud , TWAC , assault and a preach of the peace I think but he left out loads of charges (I honestly think he just couldn't be fucked sorting through it all ! ðŸ˜„) and the ones he did read out he only gave me days . When he added it up it only came to about 140 days !!! And a 5 year driving ban but I didn't get my 3 weeks remand back but wasn't giving a fuck about that ! And they sent me down the stair I was basically doing cartwheels down them !! My lawyer came down straight away and he was bewildered and said to me as long as I'm not called back up and I leave the coart there's nothing they can do . I've never wanted to go to jail so much in my life ! ðŸ˜‚ 

 A hour goes by and yip I'm taken to the bus and off to jail . I get to reception and confirm I only got 140 days for technically a 13 year sentence !! ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ did my 70 days and I was out ! Lol good times ðŸ˜Ž Plus I was dubbed up with this guy Gary who was getting visits every day as he was doing a fully commital (remand) and was getting 2/3 bags every visit and we would sell abit as well for canteen bags or for other drugs IE a bit of hash etc . I did the dealing for him since he was getting it in and giving me half so it was the least I could do . That was a great sentance especially for HMP Barlinnie as its an old Victoria shit hole locked up 22hrs a day and the screws are right bastards ! No fucking about with them .

The intention is to drown out the news article so only good information comes up when you Google your name. There is plenty of information out there on how to do this.

I had passed out in my car and had about 3 grams of dope on me. The cops found the dope and followed the ambulance as they took me to the hospital. I was in the hospital for about 5 or 6 hours (they said they can't release you if you've been narcan'ed for either 3 or 4 hours after I can't remember the exact length of time).

Well, the entire time I was in the hospital they had at least one cop there with me and I thought for sure I was going to the station once the hospital gave them the ok for me to leave. After about an hour or so, one of the cops came over to me and started asking me questions. He asked where I got the dope from and I lied and told him some corner boy whose real name I didn't know and gave him a fake description and nickname. Even after talking with me, they still stayed there and would occasionally come in and talk to/ask me something. They ended up leaving after about 5 hours of having at least one cop with me.

He took all my information (name, phone #, address) and gave me his business card and said that they would be getting in touch with me soon and that I was likely facing possession in addition to a DUI. A few days later a cop came to my house and I thought I was def getting put in cuffs right there. He ended up giving me a notice saying my license had been suspended and didn't say anything about charges.

It's been over two years since this has happened and I never heard back from them. Besides the license suspension (which from my understanding becomes the sole responsibility of the RMV once they get notice from the police), I haven't heard any interactions with police or been charged with anything (including any charge dealing with an OUI). I guess the RMV handles the driving situation and it's up to the police to deal with any charges involving an OUI, so the license suspension (RMV) and the OUI charge (the Police) are handled by two different organizations. 

I can't tell you the relief I have that I don't have anything on my record. I have a great job that I would hate to lose and it's really scary thinking you could have something attached to one's name with a simple Google search or background check.

I hope you made it out the clear. I know my story is a little different but it does show that police are often overwhelmed and do even cut breaks sometimes.",Just-Touch-It,1460582470.0

My best friend passed away in my backyard when i was in highschool. Since everyone knew we got high they blamed it on an od before they got the autopsy back. Drug that familys name through the mud and back about being part of a ""heroin ring."" its was 5 young adults that got high. No fucking heroin ring. Then the police and judges felt pressure intense pressure from the public to do something about it. So they used his ""od"" as a means to pass a bunch of bullshit warrants and arrest all of us for the most menial shit. Then the press would make us sound like stone cold killers. It was rediculous.

**THEN**

the autopsy came back and it turns out he died of an asthma attack. Did they make that correction in an article? Apologize to anyone? No fucking way. Fuck the news outlets that do that shit.",Opiatethrowaway008,1460553722.0
d214x9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ekt9d/i_was_arrested_and_bonded_but_never_heard_of_it/,t1_d2131ye,I believe all felonies in states must be by grand jury far as I know.  Though La uses that French law crap so maybe parishes there have other procedures. Arraignment is first time you go to court to plead G or NGuilty.  Most important thing for you is find out if your state has its own guidelines or uses federal guidelines.  If they use federal 1-5 grams of H qualifies as intent to distribute.  Thats when it starts to hurt.  Honestly dude courts lose traffic tickets not drug felonies Id get ahead of this if you have clean record you can probably get probation or suspended sentance.  If you get it to drug court itll be off your record after x years of good behaviour.  Most states have no cells for first time non violent offenders so dont fret much,noleitall,1460556058.0

Supposed to work that way but Ive seen plenty of judges grant exemptions.  Including one I was directly involved in.  Case was dismissed after 90 days by the court signed by the judge but 2 months later grand jury indicted.  I was shocked but I guess judges will grant extensions.  Some counties grand jury only meets once a month so they carry it over.  Its like all our (the people) rights,  looks good on paper but.  Likeguilty till proven innocent ",noleitall,1460547011.0
