cm9v59d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2n2smg/labcorp_drug_test_urine/,t3_2n2smg,"You're going to fail for THC, you can't just get clean from eating healthy and abstaining for a week. I've seen small infrequent amounts stay in a very slim and active person's body for over a month. 

You can't just sit around, eat healthy and expect to be clean. If you can stay on a treadmill or in a sauna for a good majority of the next six days you might have a shot. 

My advice, synthetic urine. It WILL work for hospitals and uterine lab's. Twenty bucks at your local head shop. That's about your only option. Good luck. ",MrDirtyMcNasty,1416672414.0

cm9x51u,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2n2smg/labcorp_drug_test_urine/,t3_2n2smg,I know someone who could consistently get THC out of there system in less than a week. He would drink a shitload of water and work out to where he would sweat and sweat and sweat. He would always pass but personally I wouldn't want to risk it with that close of a time frame. Looks like you don't have a choice so I would drink a lot of water and exercise more than you ever have.,jjdope_sea,1416677405.0
