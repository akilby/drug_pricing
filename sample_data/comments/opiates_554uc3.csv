Seriously, hope you feel better. Something tells me that after weeks, you paid your dues, the worst is now over. You're on your way, don't look back now. I'll bet over this next week you start feeling great. Loke, the complete opposite of having shards of glass in your anus.",HarpuaUnbound,1475188415.0

You really not ready to quit altogether - no excuses. After 3 weeks, you're obviously not in any acute WD, right? So your physically free from the drugs. But then you get a cold and convince yourself that a small hit of dope is what you need to fix it... as in, you justified taking the dope for medicinal purposes.

You know what regulsr people don't do when they get an irritating cold? Take heroin. They take something like cough syrups, ibuprophin...you know, normal OTC drugs designed to treat their completely normal symptoms.

If you're justifying a cough as reason enough to do heroin, imagine how quickly you'll be doing bags if you get stressed out? Or break an arm? Or face any sort of adversity?

Heroin is never the answer, so don't think that 21 days off the gear means you're in the clear to medicate yourself with heroin when you're secretly just wanting to do heroin.

Best of luck mate. I hope you see the poor judgment in your decision and don't end up back in the dope cycle over something as trivial as a cold.",OstoFool,1475218776.0
