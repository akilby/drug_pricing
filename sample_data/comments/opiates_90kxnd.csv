I’m assuming you’re female because of the nails (and my apologies if not), so you could always wrap it tightly (I always used Saran Wrap) and use nature’s pocket. I’ve done this a dozen or so times with dope and weed and never had a problem. I just go to the bathroom once I’m past security and take it out and put it in my purse. Never traveled w a rig, but I’d imagine it would work just the same. You don’t even need to put it inside—I think securing it in your panties would be fine. If that makes you nervous, you could always take a pad and cut a small opening in it and slide it in there and put it on. ",Prettyeyesforasnake,1532133029.0

e2rccvz,https://i.redd.it/w00mtc1hv6b11.jpg,t3_90kxnd,"Bring the dope, not the needle. Then go around to pharmacies until one sells rigs to you.

Check the states syringe laws that ur visiting to make sure their not prescription only, and maybe even if there's a needle exchange in the major city there. 

Easier to hid a lil powder than a syringe.   If they find that one needle, they might get suspicious and look harder.  Plus a needle is sharp and could possibly be used as a weapon, or with a sedative as a weapon to take out the pilot or some shit. No way a bag of dope could be considered a dangerous weapon tho, even tho i guess if you had carfent you could put someone out very fast by just skin contact with it.",Joe11290,1532135893.0

It's still.illegal and you'll still go to jail if they find it. It's just not as big of a risk as one might think. If it's hidden well, it's highly unlikely they'll find it. Even when you get pulled out for a more thorough search, they wouldn't likely find it hidden inside you. Or even in panties for that matter. When they do those searches, they're looking for bombs. When they do the residue test, it's for explosives. Dogs are rare and they're typically looking for bombs (there are drug dogs and explosives dogs and the latter is more commonly found in airports). 

There's always a risk. But I feel safer flying w dope than driving. Cops can do whatever the fuck they want and any search is usually a very thorough one. Often w k-9s. TSA doesn't have that authority complex quite like the 5-0. ",Prettyeyesforasnake,1532138260.0

I think only a few airports have them too, i know some of the bigger airports do though. There are other ways though you can put them in your carry on, they are only looking for weapons and bombs when they scan those so it’s easy to hid them in something so they blend in. Most people will hide them in pills, use some kind of health or vitamin supplement that’s uses capsules just pour out a few caps and put your dope in there.
