2008/2009 I was selling black in Frisco. Just got off the bart coming back from picking up, had a Mexican oz (25g) in a sandwich bag, wrapped up in toilet paper in my ass crack, which is where I've always kept it. Anyway I go into McDonald's to do a shot. At the time I was new to hitting my femoral and could only do it seated with my legs stretched out straight in front of me. This required me to sit on the nasty ass bathroom floor. So I'd always lay down a bunch of news paper and sit on that. Did my shot, cleaned up my misc pieces of toilet paper from wiping up the blood, and realized as I leaving the stall I didn't have my dope. Tore open the balled up news paper in a panic......nothing, nada, gone. Fucking flushed 24 g's down the fucking toilet. Had like 3 custies waiting for me outside, and I just yelled at them all to get the Fuck away from me, the dope is gone, Fuck off. They were like ""wtf you mean, you just said wait right here, your gonna go break it off"".... I was so pissed I just kept on walking.
Luckily for me I was able to get another zip fronted to me, and slowly clawed my way back to where I was, but that lose hurt me. ",Dsmjunky,1537117263.0

Another time I put a 40 of tar in my bra and it must have fallen out of the way home. Once, I dropped a balloon of dope down the sink, the boyfriend walked in on me about to attempt taking it apart and made me stop. Another time, I stashed my loaded shot in the bathroom up by the ceiling and it fell into the wall. The place was a trap house, not fit for human habitation, but I was prevented from taking a hammer to the wall by the ""landlord.""",extreme-77,1537108289.0
e62xoqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9gavn3/worse_bone_headed_loss_challenge/,t3_9gavn3,Not me but my ex has to win this one. She had 6 OC80s in the cup holder of the car (2010ish) Going through a gate onto a military base she tried to move it out of view and the gate guard noticed and made her pull over and get searched. Instead of being caught with them she opened the bottle in front of them and ate all six of them. They freaked out eventually forcing her to the hospital for observation and a blood test. She was under surveillance the entire time except for when she had to change into the little (extremely helpful) hospital gown. She forced herself to throw up and she miraculously threw up a ball of the 6 pills which still had a little bit of gray coating left. She knew that she wouldn’t die at that point. After the breathalyzer and blood test she only had a very small amount of oxy show up. Luckily for her she had a legit open script for percs. She smugly told her law enforcement guards that she had just taken Tylenol when the gate guards freaked out. She was released. Definitely lucky (her tolerance would not have allowed her to safely take 480 mgs of OxyContin) but definitely a boneheaded move. ,ashleylauren805,1537116596.0

Also dumped a little over a pound of sprayed up k2 all into my carpet, spread around to where you couldn’t see it without being on the ground looking for it, which I picked up with tweezers over the next few weeks. 

Wasn’t my dope thank god though. ",F1shB0wl816,1537130782.0
