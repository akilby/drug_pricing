I'd heard good things so i gave it a try at 15 mg for the first week, which had a noticeable anti anxiety effect, and made sleeping super easy. Moved up to 30 mg per day the next week as suggested, and noticed that my mood is far more stable and generally don't have the really low days.

Its no like ssri/snri's which cause a sort of oblivion, no happy but no sad feelings either. I still get sad if something bad happens, but it's a lot more manageable. It's also helped heaps with anxiety, which plays a big part in making me happier.

If you've tried other AD's without good effects, I'd really recommend giving Mirtazipine (Avanza) a try. The only major downside I've found is it seems to slow my metabolism and increase my appetite. I've put on about 5 kgs in the past month, which is utterly unheard of for me. I'm hoping the weight gains don't continue because I'm right where I want to be now.
