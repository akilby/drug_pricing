d44rtg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4mu69y/long_island_fentanyl_warning/,t1_d44r7ez,"Nah dude.  The only receptors that act on your brain are, we'll, in your brain.  The receptors in your GI tract don't get you high.  Neither do any other opiate receptors.   If they did, imodium wouldn't be an OTC drug, otherwise you'd get high off it.

So the only thing that matters are the opiate receptors in your brain.  On top of that, the only other relevant factors are whether an individual is hypersensitive or hyposensitive, or if the person is taking other daily meds which have the possibility of either potentiating the opiate, such as benzodiazepines, or reducing or nullifying their effect (such as Prozac).

Again, some people just have a naturally high tolerance and require more medication to receive the desired level of analgesia. Ok this is getting  long as fuck.. and I think I made my point lol.",Interix88,1465644039.0
