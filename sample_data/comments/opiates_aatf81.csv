One good  tell tale sign is with most er oxy it only has a colored  coating but is white inside, however most ir formulations  eg roxies ( blue 30s, pink 10s etc) are  consitant   colour all the way through.
The ERs also usually have a specific sheen that presses  dont.  
You  always wanna check the edges for consitancy as well as thats where pressies usually crumble first. However, they are getting really really good at making fakes you never wanna go on appearance  alone, Theres a couple of re agent tests u can buy like mandelin (*$30 a  big bottle) that  can test for oxy, id also highly recommend  buying some fent test strips (*$3each )
Hope this helps, stay safe brother!!",Dilly-dallier,1546153345.0

Anything can be pressed. Cameras don't depict color, depth, or enough detail to even be mostly sure sometimes, it is highly irresponsible to trust your life with strangers on the internet. You should assume that these are pressed, regardless of what people say here, and dose accordingly.

We don't allow fake pill ID posts anymore. [Here is the rule from the sidebar.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/rules#wiki_13.29_posts_requesting_pill_id_or_press_inquiries_are_not_permitted.) 

you can try searching the subreddit for past posts from before the rule change, to see some conversation. Also, check out [the Fent Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/wiki/fentanylwarnings) for links to pill weights and fentanyl warnings. ",FashionablyFake,1546154074.0

Only wish I could control myself. Initially only 28x 40's was supposed to last me all of December, but I've not only gone through that but also 50x 20's... Initially I was saving money, now I just pop them whenever. At $5/20mg it's a cheaper and better pick-me-up than a fancy coffee ðŸ˜„",WhosThatWhosWho,1546152540.0
