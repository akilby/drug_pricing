We had been getting dope from this guy for a few months and he decided to rip us off one day. My friend was trying to break it up into lines on the middle console of my car and it wouldn't break up. He had to smash the shit out of it. Got a lil bit and started to sniff it, I looked at the shit and was like.... Dude you're an idiot.
