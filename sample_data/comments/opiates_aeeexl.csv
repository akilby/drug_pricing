It was new and i went into  a drug store and set all the alarms off. lol. But by law unless they have  evidence of you stealing( like a witness or video) they can't charge you.

They first have to prove you did not ditch the product somewhere on store property.  That is very hard to do once you've already left.

Like finding that item on you, or tracking Walmart returns.. stick to your guns, say you didn't do shit.

I dont see them coming after you over it tho.  I knew a guy that every day would steal from the same few stores then drive to another one and return it for a gift card. Even after he got blocked and called the number and it said hed returned like thousands and thousands of dollars of clothes they never did anything.  Knew a few people that ran from loss prevention at like Macy's and jcpenney, and hopped in his friends moving car to get away from loss prevention.

I understand you dont want to get in trouble nut you knew the chances when you set out to do it. Returning the shit does not mean you cant or wont be prosecuted so please stop with that already.


If you were stealing to get high, you should take this as a learning experience and stop, both. This game will be the death of you. 


If you were stealing because you were legitimately starving, I am very sorry. Search your area for food banks or the like and maybe see about food stamps or some other government assistance. I can't be much help there unfortunately but I genuinely hope the best for you if that is the case.
