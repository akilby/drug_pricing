Even if you aren't gonna quit, give yourself a week off to let your brain deregulate the receptors. It'll hurt but coming back is amazing. I bet you don't even really get a rush anymore using all the time.

Also you should have waited longer for the sub, you're playing with fire taking it early like that",,1435087106.0

Qqq>I've been here 2 months. I have all the connects I need. I just got a fancy job but today is actually the first day in 3 months I haven't used daily. So I'm sweating my balls off and the sub I've been saving isn doing ANYTHINGq for all my sensitive nerves. Seriously, someone walks by and I shudder. Blech, nothing a little dopamineq  music canq't at least patch up for now.

>q
So, I guess I LOVE my new area and new job. I'M EVEN DATING A GUY. IAGINE THAT LOL.

>Totally random post but I haven't talked to a bunch of you in a while. Figured I'd give an update.

>(PS- the movie Cake on Netflix is fucking amazing. Don't watch it when you're emotional, you'll jump off a building.)
