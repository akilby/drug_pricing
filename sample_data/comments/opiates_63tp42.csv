dfx54ti,https://youtube.com/watch?v=q06UxOKc7io,t3_63tp42,I saw this a few months ago. I love everything el-p does. From juvenile techniques and co flow to RTJ. The dude is really on a different level. Im glad hes enjoying some success finally after being in the game forever and imo making two of the greatest hiphop albums ever made.

Aesop rock is my favorite rapper of all time but i think hes kinda fallen off since ""none shall pass"". Although i thought skelethon was pretty good.

But yeah, Aesop isn't as good as he was, but I still think he's smart af. 

Idk if you used to listen to Cage, but I feel he truly slid downhill.. At one point he was working with Cudi and Had Shia directing his videos, idk what happened. It's awesome you got to see the guys live, I never did :( it's a sin. ",MiteyMorphinePWRangr,1491575022.0
dfyfge1,https://youtube.com/watch?v=q06UxOKc7io,t1_dfyf5n5,I did see cage on the depart from me tour but i think he already sucked at that point. I mean he stopped agent orange after the first verse. Wtf. I think hells winter was his peak,pleasedontaskmeshit,1491575363.0
