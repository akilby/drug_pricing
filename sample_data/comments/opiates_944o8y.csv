Hydromorphone just has a low bioavailability in pill form. I’d say it’d probably be closer to 4-6 mg to really feel it the same. But to be safe I would probably start with what you said and work your way up if you need me. It’s always best to start low when unsure.,Bonafide-Beatnik,1533254972.0
e3iab98,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/944o8y/oxycodone_oral_to_hydromorphone_intranasal_help/,t3_944o8y,60mg is a huge tolerance?   Or are you referring to a higher dose?  I have seen people take over 300mg at once and I have done over 200 at once and over 400 a day.,huffinit,1533256016.0
e3ii90c,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/944o8y/oxycodone_oral_to_hydromorphone_intranasal_help/,t3_944o8y,6 mg of hydromorphone intranasal's not gonna be amazing by any means. The stuff is notoriously weak via any ROA other than IV. I remember sniffing 16 mg when I had a 1/4 to 1/2 gram habit of BTH and it felt like taking 5 mg of hydrocodone without a tolerance. Obviously YMMV ,darknessdown,1533263662.0

You are tolerant to oxycodone which is a derivative of codeine so, hydromorphone is a derivative of morphine therefor a simple convertion isn't adequate. A convertion table should only be used a reference. You are opiate tolerant nonetheless I would say between 20 to 25mg of Dilaudid ",KirkoJ,1533255635.0

I am trying to snort it which has around 56%+ Bio Availability compared to 10% Orally. 3.2mg Injected is 60mg oral oxy IV is 100% so Half that Snorting around 56% so 3.2x2 about 6.4mg snorted to feel 60mg oral oxy?,helixman21,1533255290.0

I think that sounds about right but I would just start a little lower just because of cross tolerance.

I am stating that because the chemical structure is based off a different opiate (Morphine vs Codeine) Your tolerance to hydromorphone is going to be different than your tolerance to oxycodone. Its in the same realm of opiate tolerance though so you will still have a baseline tolerance",KirkoJ,1533256253.0

Route of administration is the way your body absorbs medication. When ROA is orally, medication effects usually develop in 30mins to 45mins and last between 4 to 6 hours. Intra-nasally, through the nose, which I recommend to get high from Dilaudid - the rush and medication usually kicks in 10mins or less, your high won't last as long as taking drugs orally.
