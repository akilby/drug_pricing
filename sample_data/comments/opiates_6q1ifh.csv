This is the end of day for and i'm still sweating.  That first night, I soaked four blankets in sweat and woke up shitting rivers.  I'm really surprised at how well my mental game is just four days after the fact.  I still feel a little physical symptoms, and slight malaise, but I just get stoned and veg out on documentaries informative youtube videos.  I've been on binge withe ""CrashCourse"" series on youtube.  I've always had a insatiable appetite for learning new shit, or shit I haven't explored in a long time.

**Addendum:** Day five.  Things are going pretty well.  I feel like, this could be a long break for as long as I can.  I've had ample opportunities to chase it down since I jumped off.  It's like, why though.  You're fine, you're not in pain.  Nor are you even physically wd'ing.  The malaise is manageable.  I'm a life long opiate user.

Second day I felt like death and was firing from both ends and sweat non stop. Third day I started feeling better.

I was hearing cows moo eventhough I lvie in a city.
Saw pitbulls at the side of my bed.
Saw my cats face in flowers outside.

I  thought someone was hiding behind a fence in my garden who wantd to kill me. When I had to walk downstairs I was crawling so he couldn't see me through the windows.

Was having weird moments where things around me didn't seem real. Hard to explain. But it's someof the sound I was hearing was louder than other sound in the area ooutside, but it didn't belong there.

I was having weird halicinations like my hatstand looked like a cousin it figure when I walked by it.

Once I heard tropical birds when I had to piss.

And there were a shit load of panic attacks. I normally have panic attacks, but the wd just made it 10 times worse.
Annoying muscle spasms too where amuscle would tremble for 30 mintues or your hand would fly off to the side while you're holding a computer mouse while trying to play a FPS lol
