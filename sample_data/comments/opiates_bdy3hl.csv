el1u150,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bdy3hl/i_tried_some_fentadope_last_night_for_the_first/,t1_el1tsdl,Because there can be hot spots in the pills where the fentanyl is not evenly distributed. So you can use for example 1/4 of a pill and get a decent but safe high... but then another 1/4 from the same pill could have double the fentanyl in it as your first piece did. Its dosing unpredictably and that's where it really gets dangerous. Glad to hear though that you are not using alone and you have narcan on hand. Stay safe man,chasingd0pamine,1555448229.0
