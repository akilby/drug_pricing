dz71hd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8keq2r/xan_v_k/,t3_8keq2r,Meh. Personal preference really. Xanax is less euphoric for me. Everyone is different. Be careful mixing it can be deadly. ,inlovewithheroin,1526663197.0

dz7ewc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8keq2r/xan_v_k/,t3_8keq2r,r/benzodiazepines would be the proper sub. But I prefer Klonopin due to the longer duration and it makes me feel a little more functional. Xanax if I want to use benzos to get high rather than anxiety relief.,hemminski,1526675791.0

If you're looking to stop anxiety attacks,  or get high, xan

Personally I like kpins. They make me feel ""normal"". I can function normally as far as with work and fam. 

I stopped fucking with xan due to how addicting they were for me. I just wanted to take more and more. Also they would make me feel a lot more drowsy and not with it. 

Also it's harder to find a steady source of pharm xan, and presses are a slippery slope. ",EskomojoE,1526691903.0
