It DOES slow bowel motility quite a bit and can lead to constipation. I take daily magnesium.  Much of this problem is the hydrophobic nature of the powder: it tends to clump tightly in the digestive system. ",Jeffery_G,1533643472.0

I do take magnesium too, but magnesium doesn't do anything to get rid of oxy constipation or even codeine constipation. If magnesium is what's stopping me from getting constipated off kratom that's some really weak constipation.

I also stay really hydrated, but again that doesn't do much for constipation off regular opiates even when it's just codeine it will constipate me.

Maybe I'm just lucky in how my body reacts to the stuff, but kratom just doesn't seem to constipate me at all. 

If anything kratom powder actually gives me the shits a little!",MercedesBenzoAMG,1533656821.0
