Even if you're not totally in love with it, being totally focused on something (anything) gets your mind off wanting to use.  Inevitably, after your activity is done, you'll start thinking about using again, but it'll be shocking in a good way, because you'll realize that for the last few hours, you've had a ""normal"", non-addict brain.  Once you realize that you CAN be ""normal"" again, it's a lot easier to stick to it.",allesklaar,1356135424.0

I think you actually live like right next to me.  Send me a PM if you want my phone number.  I can bring you around to some meetings and introduce you to some people with real recovery.  If you just wanna check a meeting out by yourself my home group is tomorrow, Sunday, at HMC in Flemington.  It's at 7:30 PM in Meeting Room C.  Come check it out, it's a great place to start.

I've been on opiates(mainly hydro, then oxy for most of the time) for a year and a half now. The last two weeks of my addiction I was banging the great Chicago heroin, and then my dad caught me with the needle and spoon in the bathroom. It was upsetting, yet relieving that my family found out be because I needed the support. It makes getting through addiction that much easier. It all gets easier through time and it's nice because at my rehab they have a doctor that helps me get through it. In withdrawals he prescribed me clonidine and trazedone, but also naltrexone to help with the cravings as an opiate blocker. Keep up the good work man only time heals this cruel process. You can PM me if you need to.",hoosiers0,1356125375.0
