Wouldn't be a bad idea to buy a detox drink at your local head shop too. If you buy the drink make sure to follow the directions on the bottle, or else it'll be a complete waste of ~$30",alprazorick,1433563113.0

I've never tried to pass which makes me weary but I was also clean from smoking nug in about the same time. I have a pretty quick metabolism which gives me hope. any detoxes that work for opiates? I tried researching and didn't are too much hope,squadde,1433563501.0

EDIT:  sorry misread that. but I don't believe I would. I asked him a few months ago what would happen with a dirty UA and he said the first one would probably be an IOP program which they would pay for and I'd attend a couple nights a week. but what they say and what actually happens are two different things as I've come to learn when dealing with the law",squadde,1433902837.0
