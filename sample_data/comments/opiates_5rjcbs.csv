Yeh they do seem to be steering people towards subbies rather than methadone ive noticed that as a bit back every junkie and his dog were on methadone the clinics were slinging it out like fuck, but now its like 50/50 with just as many on subs as meth . Ive been on both and stable on subbies now which are fine but i used to enjoy feeling methadone kick in with a hot drink to bring it up faster ",crumbeggingbaghead,1486075098.0
dd984qz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5rjcbs/most_useful_tapering_compound/,t1_dd97h1i,sorry re-read the original post and saw the bit about no access to doctor - if the opiates you have access to are Meth or Subs why not do a 3 - 4 week taper down to nothing ?  I've done this plenty and other than persistent insomnia it works great : because you haven't been on either substance for years a quick detox is possible - you just need to tailor the initial dose to the size of your rabbit and gradually step down from there..... one opiate that I have never used to successfully taper is Morphine - after months (years ? decades ?) of #3 gear it just doesn't touch the sides ! ,the_roguetrader,1486075412.0
