In SF I have heard that you can still score most pills in the TL and okay black, but a lot of the tar is just shit. Also police are everywhere out there. Honestly, there are tons of pills everywhere in the Bay, especially in the east bay, but really you need to know someone to find them.;",blackwrx,1329085831.0

It's very open and u should have absolutely no problem gettin what u want. A few things to keep in mind: 1. Go early like 10-11am( a little earlier is much better)2. Make sure u check what is given to u immediately BEFORE handing over the moola as to not get ripped off( smell it, open it etc). 3. Act like u know what Ur doin and b confident.4. Keep an eye out for the 5-0. And 5. Don't deal with anyone that looks like a crackhead or is wearing dirty clothes. It was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be and remember to read the opiophile guide. There's also a blog on scoring h in san Fran. It is a dangerous place so watch Ur back and ALWAYS haggle. If one person can't help u out, another will b around the corner.",opiyay,1330640168.0
