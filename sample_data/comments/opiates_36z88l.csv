And all 4 of them had the advantage of not having there own connection so it was a hassle to score. You should quit now before things get worse if you can.

It scares the hell out of me. I get mini panic attacks sometimes when I think about it, yet when Wednesday rolls around (the day I order), I'm all for it. I don't even have WDs as an excuse to not be able to quit, I'm just a weak piece of shit I suppose.

There's a reason for you posting this and sharing your feelings here. This is the best place to do it, I think. We've all been where you are right now in one way or another. (This turned out to be pretty long, sorry! I'm long winded at times)
I'm on suboxone (I know I always seem to say that when I post and don't know why). I know a lot of people find it hard to come here when they aren't using, but I do because I guess in some weird way it fills the void that dope left in my soul. I get to still experience it at a safe distance through the people that post and pick and choose what I see. And maybe I'll say something that resonates enough to help someone one day. 
When I was at the point you're at I wish I would have stopped. I had started doing dope after exclusively being addicted to pills (oxy and methadone mostly and clonapin) for about 9 years maybe 10 and
had actually had some clean time. I was chipping with it a few times a week successfully. It was awesome and fun and like you I saw that it could (and for me,would) get dangerous and out of control fast. So I went and got on suboxone, but the dope was just too fun. I went to the doctor for a few months and saved up my scripts. My plan was to use dope for a little while and use the subs I saved to come off and be able to keep chipping. 
That didn't last long. By the time I ran out of money I had sold most of the subs already for money to buy more dope. I was fucked, let me tell you. I used the subs I did have and tapered a little, but not enough. I ended up back on pills and then back on dope again. And again. And again. 
I had started out snorting and making a bun last me a week and when it was over and I finally surrendered and got back on subs I was shooting a half gram at a time once or twice a day. My house was about to go into foreclosure after a year of no payments. My husband had pawned his phone along with anything else we had of value to help us get by. My bills weren't paid and we had run out of heating oil in the middle of winter and had to apply for a free emergency delivery. After a month on subs we had enough money to get our stuff out of pawn and buy back the things we'd lost. We make good money and it was not just a shame, but fucking stupid that we blew so much on dope for so long. 
They say that we're born predisposed to addiction, like born addicts. That may be true and I had heard that before, so picking up dope was the stupidest decision of my life. Most of us can make it work until we just can't anymore. It's not all great and fun and exciting for long. You don't see too many people totally clean without a maintenance drug. So if I could go back to when I could have walked away and stay away, I would do it to save myself and especially my son and family, from all the pain and destruction that my dope habit caused. 
I really hope you find what works best for you and stay with it, but when using dope, what works best changes fast. I was always one of those that swore I'd never end up fully addicted or shooting up. I knew better, but I did it anyway just like I did dope anyway. It's a slippery slope to say the very least.

U dont feel addicted and when u get high it makes everything better and u havent suffered any consequences. Soo obviously u keep getting high even if u space it out over time. But i bet u think about it when ur not on it. Its a progressive problem and gets worse over time. U said nothing negative happened to u which is how it was for me so like u said its easy to justify. Just watch out for that days where u find urself justifying using becoming closer and closer together and the reasons of justification start to become ridiculous and then thats when u start to slip.
