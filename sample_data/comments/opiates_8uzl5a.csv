It was a good run and it‚Äôs completely fucked my life again. I‚Äôve never tried maintenance before, maybe it‚Äôll work long-term. Fingers crossed. ",jf209,1530334987.0

I guess because I‚Äôm just not used to it at all but I did one shot like 4 days ago(first shot, didn‚Äôt miss or anything but it did take me 45-60sec of fumbling around in my arm to figure out how to pull the plunger back with one hand) and my entire arm hurt & felt weak for like 3 days. It also left a nice Lil bruise which was sort at the pin spot on my vein. Can‚Äôt imagine what I‚Äôd look & feel like after like 30 in 2 days...",IshitonUrdog,1530341218.0

Try not to beat yourself up for the past-leave it there. Make sure you surround yourself with peeps who support you in your new life! Its about to get amazingly better and you‚Äôre making a great choice! Best wishes and good luck!üçÄ‚ô•Ô∏èüçÄ",Justplain5150,1530385544.0
e1kxcmb,https://i.redd.it/9hiohfael2711.jpg,t3_8uzl5a,Definitly a hard choice its almost as if you have to have something in place to fill where the usage once did. You can expect to feel a bit down but the main thing is you‚Äôre now safe and it‚Äôs only going to keep better. Do what you can to keep your mind busy-binge on shows-read if thats‚Äôs something you enjoy. I found myself on suboxone  boards reading as much as i could its an awesome community the one i use-its like here only its larger and fully dedicated to subs.i don‚Äôt know how to link but  you may enter Suboxone forums in your browser and Bam! You‚Äôre there lol. Feel free to pm me if you need im not always on but i will get back to you. Nighttime is a big tough one for me my total witchy hours lol so im on here late often. You‚Äôre on your way brother. It will get better I cross my heart!‚ô•Ô∏èbest wishes!!! Oh wanted to add if sleeping helps and you can do it id say keep doing it. Anything that supports your choice to be clean is a good thing. People talk a lot about moderation i for one have trouble sleeping so i dont see it hurting you at all.ü§òüèª  ,Justplain5150,1530408623.0

e1kl6tr,https://i.redd.it/9hiohfael2711.jpg,t1_e1k4dmf,I really just think its from moving all around trying to pull the plunger back. I always get a little bruise & sore when getting any blood drawn at the docs and this just seems like a more extreme version.
