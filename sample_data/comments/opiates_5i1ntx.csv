db4xg4c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbiCjm6B4Sc,t1_db4srz2,"pretty much. I remember being really fucking high and telling my buddy, ""damn, I haven't felt a rush like this in a fucking minute"" and then bam I wake up super confused and pissed cuz I have water all over my face and bed and I accused my buddy of breaking my brand new nasal Narcan vial cuz it was next to me and had been used. he was trying to tell me I OD'd and I was certain that he was full of shit lol it took me probably a good minute or so before I realized what actually happened.

it's hella crazy that I'm alive today cuz I had just happened to acquire that Narcan the day before from a friend that moved from the east coast. A different friend just so happened to hit me up as I was almost back to my apartment from copping and he was looking for some dope and I almost didn't reply cuz I didn't wanna share but at the last minute I decided to tell him to come over and I'd sell him half of what I picked up. he gets there and I show him the Narcan I got cuz it was the nasal and we live in the PNW where we only have the IM Narcan so I thought he'd find it amusing. before we do our shot he's fucking around with it and pulls it out the of the box and assembles it and is reading the instructions cuz I hadn't even bothered to do so yet. 

10 minutes later and it's served its purpose and saved my life. everything just happened to fall in place perfectly, from acquiring the Narcan the day before, to hesitantly replying to my friend to come over, to my friend's sudden interest in how to administer nasal Narcan being stronger than his interest in shooting the dope I had just picked up. not to mention the timing of everything and him being close enough to my house that I didn't have time to do a shot before he got there by myself.

db51grt,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbiCjm6B4Sc,t1_db4yesw,"thanks man, and yes, the stars aligning perfectly is a great way to describe that night and the circumstances surrounding it. those tram seizures sound terribly scary themselves though! forgive me as I don't have much experience with tramadol but are seizures common with tram use? I feel like I've heard about them on here before... 

the thought of having a seizure scares the shit outta me cuz I've seen a couple diff friends have one due to drug abuse. One in particular that really spooked me was when I let a friend of my dealer's come into my place to do a shot real quick as he had just picked up a couple bags. well I'm still not entirely sure what happened that night but I believe he had been drinking quite a bit before he arrived and then shot more black than he probably could have realistically handled because he did his shot, and then grabbed onto my desk with both hands and started shaking the desk violently as if he was seizing until he abruptly stopped and fell backwards flat onto his back. I immediately administered nasal Narcan and then started doing rescue breathing at which point he started seizing again for another 30 seconds or so until I'm assuming the Narcan kicked in and he became conscious again. he was visibly shaken and confused and just started bawling lol poor guy! It probably didn't help that I started yelling at him as soon he opened his eyes, pissed off that he recklessly shot way more dope than he could knowingly handle while also drunk but then I felt bad cuz he was crying and looked so scared so I just gave him a hug and told him I was glad he was ok lol      ",clickclvck,1481635312.0
db521i2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbiCjm6B4Sc,t1_db51grt,"I mean theyre common w/ junkies who do tram. And it happens with theraputical doses too but way way way way more unlikely. It's a combination of factors usually that goes into it. Reaching over the 400mg/day lowers your threshold. Bad sleep as well. Not eating well lowers it too. Stress factors in. so it's a cocktail of stuff. But yeah, it's common when you're for example sleep deprived, not been eating right for a few days, and you smash a 6-700mg. Goodnight sweet prince. During right circumstances though, it's pretty easy to go way above this. My habit was around 1g per day for a while, even reaching 2g. I never seizured on these doses because I religiously took care of my food intake and sleep. I've seizured on 300mg once and 800mg once, and well once while withdrawing from benzo. But that was another thing entirely, that was way worse. 

Edit : Missed your edit :) Haha poor guy, but sounds like you handled it like a champ. Watching people seizure is fucked up..",CloudRain313,1481636412.0
