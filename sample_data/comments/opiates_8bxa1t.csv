How long did that take for you OP? I'm excited at the prospect of some extra $$. I've tried sites where you can bid on like computer programming jobs, web design, shit like that but people in India always offered to do the jobs for amounts that made it not even close to being worth the effort to someone in the US. How much time of actual work would you say that you put in to make that $20?",br0ken1985,1523629818.0
