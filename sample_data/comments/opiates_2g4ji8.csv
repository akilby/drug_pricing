ckfp0ry,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2g4ji8/can_i_use_without_withdrawal/,t3_2g4ji8,I've always used H without developing WD symptoms (or at least nothing significantly noticeable). What I do to prevent being sick is only using a maximum of three days in a row (your max days may vary) and then ceasing use for at least 5-7 days afterwards to reduce tolerance and thus preventing withdrawal. Only taking a day off won't be long enough of a abstinent period to prevent withdrawal.,LordGobbletooth,1410470245.0

ckfpa8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2g4ji8/can_i_use_without_withdrawal/,t1_ckfp0ry,"Thanks. How about tolerance too? Like a half gram of tar over a period of one week ain't shit. Basically enough to give me a nice little antidepressant and sleep tonic for a few nights. 

Like ppl here use a gram of ECP a day. I used to use a lot and would def get cold shaky sweaty and horrible wds. I'm beyond that now and kinda thinking I might actually be outta the woods. Like I could use and not go through much wd. Oh that dangerous voice in my head. ",JulesVernon,1410470761.0

ckfpsz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2g4ji8/can_i_use_without_withdrawal/,t1_ckfpa8y,"Well a lot of times when I'd go on binges I'd be more or less opioid-naive in terms of tolerance, so I might only go through a fraction of a gram during a binge. So my tolerance level would never rise enough for symptoms to occur. Obviously the amount depends on the purity of the stuff, but my normal dose would only be maybe 60-75mg. The key is being able to stop when you have to.",LordGobbletooth,1410471812.0
