I'd recommend do an enema like an hour beforehand. Baby syringes work great, you can ask for one at a pharmacy or buy baby Tylenol and they have one in the box. And use lube!

Morphine is the main active ingredient of opium.  Pulling an idea out of my ass with zero evidence to back it, morphine pills might be absorbed better if you grind them up in a little vodka first and down that.",GuyGregH,1542674564.0

Instant feeling of having to go immediately, and it says to try to hold it in for 5 minutes whereas I lasted 30 seconds tops. Not to be gross but I had a healthy sized poo a couple hours prior so the fact that twice that amount came out (and was a little dry) was shocking. I'd recommend doing it at least once if you are ever constipated. ",SnikkiDoodle_31,1542677120.0

Also, you could literally say that about any opiate.

I once came across a 40mg opana, but it was abuse/tamper proof.. so i chugged a pint of vodka then chewed it ip with non-diet coke in my mouth..
