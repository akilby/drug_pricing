To your Q: even without tolerance 2.6mg are not a dangerous dose if not IV'd but taken orally or nasally. Orally is a huge waste due to low bioavailability  (~25% I think), so you should snort or boof them. You have to crush the little beads in order to snort them best with a mortar and pestle (same for boofing, crush them and soak in cold water, mix and pull water up into oral syringe - without Needle obviously)",Hydromorpheus,1538247858.0

Assuming that’s how you’re going to take it I would take it all. I think it would be fine even with no tolerance since oral bio is low. And you should be feeling pretty good since you have no tolly. Eating them is a waste tho. Since I don’t rec a someone with no tolerance touching a needle or anyone for that matter. Going the iv route is a slippery very slippery slip.  You should prolly snort them at least. Eating is a huge waste of dillies. Or if you’re not opposed to this ROA you should plug them up the back lol. 

And It’s just as addictive as any other opiate man. That’s opiates. Addictive as fuck especially if you have addict personality ",deemp,1538248274.0

Why tf would they make Hydromorphone capsules and pills if the bioavailability is so low? Wouldnt Morphine or Oxycodone be better for taking it orally or do they have a low bioavail. as well?
