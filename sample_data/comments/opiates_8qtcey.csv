First time I didnt understand what was happening at first, and i was just really mad at him, screaming and yelling, throwing up too of course. Then i calmed down and apologized later. Never seen someone get canned and be at all civil afterwards. The thought that someone just saved your life doesnt have any meaning in the moment.",jabberwauk,1528919579.0

Not only that, I pushed them off my pockets over and over...but when I got to the hospital in the key pocket I still had the rest of my dope~!!! They took all my needles and shit tho, so I had to go to buy some at the pharmacy. Seemed a little backwards to take away my needles. 

They wanted a pee sample as well. They wanted to know if fent dropped me. I couldn't pee. 3 hours later I finally got some out and a nurse who had just stepped in on shift change-I guess- was like what am I supposed to do with this?? ""Do you remember who asked you to do this"" lol

I don't get it tho. I get taking my dope. But of course they couldn't find it. And yeah, I stayed high. But why would they take all my clean supplies???? Isn't that dangerous?

I'm in Western Canada btw. That was my first OD. second was in a barn and I woke up 8 hours later. 3rd was in transitional housing. The last time I was here. I made so much noise a neighbor banged on the ceiling so I was banging on the floor back at her. Staff came up , ""So what's going on"" opps. ",Turtle_Shell_Hotel,1528922877.0

I died from too many speedballs at my friends apartment (I live in the same complex). So I was standing up and then I just fucking fell flat on the floor once it happened. Then I was given narcan. Then I commenced screaming and running all the way back to my apartment building, whilst eating shit multiple times.
The only way I can describe it is that the narcan made me go faster than my body could physically Handel.
When I finally got back to my place, I snapped out of the rage/blackout I was in.
I wasn't in withdrawal... but I didn't know what the fuck had happened. 
Everything in my body hurt but mainly my face, head and lungs.
I ended up walking back up to my friends apartment. 
I asked her what happened and she told me I Oded and her roommate grabbed my narcan and hit me with that shit.
Just as she says this, two cops walk in through the front door and I had to convince them that I didn't OD, just so they would fucking leave.
The chick pig had a concerned look on her face, but I knew she was looking for an excuse to bust me for the heroin in my pocket.",Funkpolice911,1528956033.0
e0nagp4,https://i.redd.it/2ymmt1x0fs311.jpg,t1_e0na6o9,"Man, that reminds me so much of the time I OD'd on coke. It wasn't a speedball shot that did it to me, because I didn't have enough dope to do more and save some for the come down. I hate not having dope for the coke comedown.

I shot a .25, on accident. This was great coke and i had been doing about .15-.18 all night. Well, the paper i had been weighing my shots on had accumulated extra and it was my last coke shot for the night, so I may as well make it a big one, right? Well, I know the paper had .08 or so on it, from the difference in the weight of the paper before and after. I was so fucking dumb for not even thinking about it before blasting off.

As soon as i did my shot I stood up and I also fell flat on the floor. I had two seizures and stopped breathing. My boyfriend heard from the other room and gave me CPR. I guess I came to, obviously. I was so delirious for a bit from the high and the lack of oxygen. It was crazy. I was so fucking sore for about 2 weeks after that.",OxyCaughtIn,1528956499.0

Passed out at a train station and woke up in an ambulance.

e0nddsa,https://i.redd.it/2ymmt1x0fs311.jpg,t1_e0nd8fi,"Haha, exactly. I doubt I would have had the extra to throw in that night if I wasn't using the scale.

I dunno if he would be cool with me shooting coke. I haven't brought it up since then, that was about 9 months ago. I have done it a couple times since that he doesn't know about, but I'm trying to stop doing shit behind his back.

He is okay with me shooting dope every now and then. We've gotten to where I'll use a few grams every 3-4 weeks or so. That's been working fairly well so far. It keeps me in check a little bit and since he knows about it at least he'll be around to narcan me if I ever need it.

I use kratom daily besides that though, otherwise I wouldn't be able to make it three days, hah.

He's cool with me doing other shit occasionally too, a little acid or molly or ket here and there. Which is awsome. I'm really surprised he's as willing as he is, considering he's hates needles.

I think he knows I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do anyway and it's better for him to know and me be safer about it.",OxyCaughtIn,1528961880.0

I know it doesn't for me.

Good for you though.
Coke is hard to say no to when it's available.
And  a faithful relationship is all the better.

I'm curious though...
We're you a junkie before or after you started dating?

I've been in a relationship for 6-7 years now and it's definitely been fucked up watching it go from smoking weed to heroin (my gf doesn't use anything).",Funkpolice911,1528962404.0
