So it can certainly save your life if you’re about to die from respiratory depression due to an opi/benzo combo. I guess you’d still be barred the fuck out when you wake up from the narcan? Idk I’ve never had the happen.

All that said, be super fucking careful with the benzos, especially if you’re doing oxy. The thing about benzos is once you’re a little barred out you’ll just keep compulsively redosing and end up taking like 10 bars in a day (happened many times to myself and all my friends). And I assume you know but the benzo withdrawal is way worse than the opi withdrawal and is actually fatal. Even 1-2 bars a day will lead to withdrawals if you take them daily for long enough. 

I used to love doing oxy, a bar, and having a few drinks (stupid, I know) all at the same time. Nowadays I realized the Xanax takes away too much from the euphoria I like from the opioids, so I probably wouldn’t do more than like a quarter or half a bar while on opioids, if at all.",Jay_chill,1546143538.0
ecuo347,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aasbn7/does_nalaxone_also_work_if_the_patient_has/,t3_aasbn7,The nalaxone would be enough. It’s extremely hard to od on benzos. When people mix its the h they od on because the benzos potentiate the opiates but once you reverse the opiates they might still be barred out but they’ll be alive. I’ve dealt with this 3 times in real life. ,MusicManGraham,1546144607.0

I actually experienced this less than a week ago when an idiot dealer around here decided cutting his shit with benzos (or some other substance that has the same effects) would be a good idea.  Needless to say jumping into the backseat to hit this person with narcan while my husband was going 65mph down the highway was an interesting experience. ",drowning_ophelia,1546145452.0
ecuk340,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aasbn7/does_nalaxone_also_work_if_the_patient_has/,t3_aasbn7,"Naloxone & flumazenil would probably be the way to go. 

Naloxone as the opioid receptor antagonist and flumazenil as the negative allosteric modulator of GABAa.  

But even if the person has taken opioids and benzodiazepines the Naloxone will work on its own. It just won’t reverse the benzo effects & vice versa. ",Butterfly-opacities,1546141077.0

ecuollw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aasbn7/does_nalaxone_also_work_if_the_patient_has/,t1_ecukh4s,I took benzos for years and never really experienced withdrawal even going colt turkey. I was on 4-6 mgs a day too. I was honestly sicker after my first h binge back in 2014 and that was when I was a kid with no tolerance. Made 4 points last 5 or 6 days (which is absolutely nothing to me now as I could fire all that off in one shot) Didn’t even know withdrawal was a thing at that point. Fast forward 24 hours and I was soooo ducking sick. Had to kick at bonnaroo in the 100 degree heat and no peace or comfort. Not to mention you do t generally find those kinds of drugs at fests. Long story short. 5 days of iv opiate use was a worse withdrawal than 4-6 mgs of Xanax for over 2 years. Everyone is different tho...,MusicManGraham,1546145046.0

ecuopal,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aasbn7/does_nalaxone_also_work_if_the_patient_has/,t1_ecump9x,Benzos and weed are the cure for withdrawal in my opinion. I can actually manage to feel okay if I have both of those.,MusicManGraham,1546145133.0
ecvpxhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aasbn7/does_nalaxone_also_work_if_the_patient_has/,t3_aasbn7,I OD'ed on a benzo opiate combination a few months ago and my girlfriend found me unresponsive when she got home from work. Thank God I had Narcan because her administrating it truly saved my life. Me coming to and talking to the paramedics that arrived shortly after coming to was very hazy and I have the faintest of memories of what was going on. I honestly didn't realize what had happened until I woke up the next morning. So yes the Narcan alone should work but the combination of that and the Flumazanil from a paramedic is what will truly save your life. That Narcan will help start bringing you back until the EMTs get there but don't put your 100% faith in it. My recommendation is to get off of the benzos if you can. An accident can always happen and like in my situation your significant other might not be there when your OD starts. I truly have been blessed to still be here today. Just be careful my friend! ,awer0515,1546187908.0
