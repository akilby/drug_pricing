They will getchu set up straight with a benzo for sleep, clonidine for the restlessness, and something for the nausea! What they give ya plus some lope & you'll breeze through the physical symptoms. Unfortunately, only you can beat the mental cravings once through the physical bullshark!! Good luck to ye brother!",,1444137890.0

It's nowhere near my tolerance level but a night time cold thing puts me down to sleep.  I don't know why, it's weird. But it totally knocks me for six (that's a cricket metaphor). Pharmacist only cold medicine, Lemsip, but the one in my land that you (these days) have to give your licence to get. I do have my standard pst - which I highly recommend to get off H or pills - but yeah it puts me DOWN.  ",catsiclepops,1444136553.0
