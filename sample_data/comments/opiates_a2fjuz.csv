If I'm going to take a 40mg oxy, ill crush the entire pill and mix it with water in a shot glass, than test the solution with the Fent strip. If it comes back negative for Fent, i will just drink the shot of oxy water.   
I kind of like the taste of Oxy so it doesn't bother me and i don't like wasting  any of my oxy ahah.",Kylerdub,1543859679.0
