I felt like while on suboxone it didn't matter what I put in my body because it wasn't my drug of choice. The scariest thing was getting the stomach warmth euphoria feeling from a few beers. Alcoholism terrifies me despite my own addiction. ,sassytunacorn,1481099180.0

daw1oke,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gye7x/suboxone_to_coke/,t3_5gye7x,After a year or so on subs I was taking a lot of benzos and drinking. Eventually just went off it and started doing speedballs but I think if you can stick with just suboxone it can help you. It got me as close to a normal human being as I've been in years.,Lacklustar,1481094360.0
daw3vob,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gye7x/suboxone_to_coke/,t3_5gye7x,"I used to be an opiate addict that took a few benzos with them maybe 3 nights out if the week. Well i got on subs and after a few weeks I was a daily benzo user as well. Since I no longer had to pay out the ass for hydrocodone anymore I had free money to get way more benzos. Then came the spice, but that's another story. God I remember being k2 sick, benzo sick, and opiate sick all at once. I didn't eat or sleep for a good 5 days. Went delirious and couldn't tell dreams and my imagination from real life. The worst part? I had subs, but I was so sick even putting a tiny piece of sub in my mouth made me dry heave violently. 

Sorry i kinda trailed off reliving the hell on earth that is k2 withdrawals...ill take good ol dopesick any day",Skankin_llama,1481100544.0

I found myself doing that quite often - but eventually I got tired of the lifestyle, it faded away and now I do coke once in a while, I have no problem with that - I still like feeling a bit tipsy, a bit high... I did  not signup for a 100% sober life neither  ;) ",rawas1978,1481104092.0
daw0sh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gye7x/suboxone_to_coke/,t3_5gye7x,Eh i went from coke to xans to opiates. I believe firmily that when youre happy you do uppers and when depressed do downers imo. When i was doing coke i was going through a great period in my life. Turned to downers when my life went to shit. Not really many withdrawels to coke tho besides headaches n feeling shitty. Nothing compared to pills tho at all ,Ajm6753,1481092262.0
dawxu0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gye7x/suboxone_to_coke/,t1_daw3fl6,"Absolutely empathize with that last bit about alcohol. I truly do hate it, but after quitting it was the closest I could get to complete inhibition/relaxation, or nodding out (AKA passing out shitfaced). I despise myself for my past with alcohol infinitely more than opiates. And it only lasted 3 months! Amazing what boredom and isolation can make you think is totally fine.

dax6pm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5gye7x/suboxone_to_coke/,t1_dax5v0a,"The worst hell i could imagine. A solid week of agonizing pain, if i slept I couldn't tell you because dreams, my imagination, and reality were all one in the same. I watched this silly Britcom called blacks books, in an episode where they housesit and accidentally drink a bottle of 900 year old sacramental wine. I was convinced a few of those bottles were in my hall closet. I went to show my mom and everything.
Better yet, I watched this documentary just called ""using."" It's a documentary following a few Chinese heroin addicts. Badass doc if you can find it. But I got a wire crossed and thought they were in Singapore, where they give out the death penalty for drugs even more so than China. Suddenly a bottle appears in my room with Asian writing on it...i thought I had been shipped drugs from Singapore and was worried I'd be extradited and put to death. 

That was just the mental. The physical side was equally agonizing. Couldn't eat, could barely hold down water long enough for my body to absorb it, sleep was non existent so that only exacerbated the psychosis. 
Not to mention that above I said I was going through benzo w/d's as well. Restless legs? Try restless body. Same feeling as rls just all over. 

Something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and I'm a vengeful, spiteful motherfucker. ",Skankin_llama,1481158119.0
