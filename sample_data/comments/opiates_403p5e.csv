Fuck my life lol. So i go in the bathroom to toss my boxers. I guess the boxers didnt catch it all so im trying to clean my pants off a bit. Water wasnt cutting it. I find a bottle of windex sitting in there so i use it to clean up best i could. When i get back to the car my buddy asks me why it smells like windex.

We've all done disgusting things to support our habits, we've all fucked someone, intentional or not, and been fucked, time and time again. But this is one of the sadder things I've ever read, just by a quick sentence that you didn't intend to be a big deal.. Calling your precious 4 month old baby your ""situation"" absolutely breaks my heart. Parents using with the child around hurts me even worse. You clearly don't care what redditors have to say, won't care what I have to say, and will continue to do what you do, because this is your life and you're damn well going to live it. I have never wished this on a soul, not even my worst enemy, as I can only imagine the pain, suffering and utter heartbreak involved. But I genuinely hope DSS gets involved. No child deserves this.. And before you say I don't know what I'm talking about, I'm not in your situation, yadda yadda, I do. I have a very young child myself. Never once have I used around her or in any way had her involved. I'm no better than you, I am NOT standing on a pedestal, I am a fucked up individual and absolutely define junkie, so please don't take it that way, as I look down upon NOBODY. But your baby is the line, bro. That is THE line you cannot cross. You have got to fix this for the baby, and you have to acknowledge the baby as more than your ""situation"", man. 


I'm done. Again, I know you don't care, but this is just something that I felt obligated to say. I wish you all the luck in the world, and I truly hope you and your wife get it all figured out, and soon, for the sake of the baby.

Hurtin for a squirtin may very well be the most disgusting thing I've ever read in text, lol! Props.
