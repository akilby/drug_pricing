d0otpy1,https://imgur.com/a/VnECq,t1_d0opyqg,"Nah that's not completely true, it can be any shade really it just depends on how you mix it. The syrup itself (Actavis) is pretty murky and purple fresh out of the bottle. If you don't mix it with much sprite than it'll stay 'muddy' and look more purple. The more sprite you use when mixing, the lighter the color will be. ",haamm,1457208623.0
d0ov9b1,https://imgur.com/a/VnECq,t1_d0otpy1,when the act is raw it's the purple shade but every time I've mixed it with Sprite no matter what amount it would go to pink varying shades. never did it stay a dark purple color like what's poured up. ,Tittyboi_3Chainz,1457211471.0
d0ovoar,https://imgur.com/a/VnECq,t1_d0ov9b1,"Well we've had different experiences then. Whenever I've mixed it with a small small small amount of sprite + grape JR it's been a purple-ish color just a little lighter than when it's poured straight out of the bottle. It's turned pink for me when I've either put too little syrup/too much sprite, or when it's been different brands. I don't fuck with syrup anymore though because it does nothing at all for me. When I get it prescribed I can usually trade it to my dealer for a brick or more worth of dope.",haamm,1457212237.0
