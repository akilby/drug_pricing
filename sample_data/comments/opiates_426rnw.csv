I do take issue with the cop claiming that heroin causes hallucinations, though. Soon it'll be, ""we tasered him because he was clearly hallucinating and was a danger to himself and others.""",Traintomars,1453491328.0

I'm not defending this man because there is no excuse to do it for 17 minutes, but I am saying to look at the story from all angles. The man is a criminal but he also was likely intoxicated an we don't know the extent of it. If his friend was hiding his heroin usage and was pretending to just drink with his friends, then his buddy has a clear reason to assume he's just passed out drunk.



Regardless, RIP to the young dude who passed away. We lose too many people in their teens and early 20's to this addiction we're all afflicted with. This should be another call for people who are feeling like they're too far gone to get help. There are lots and lots of resources available to people who want help and some/most of them are pretty painless. People will help you detox and won't make you suffer through terrible WD symptoms. If you are feeling down please look for resources and help to get clean.",haamm,1453495907.0

I assumed this was a hidden thing, but if the person knew that the victim was using this is pretty heartless. The thing is, this could have started with a heavy nod too, and then it became an overdose. I just like to stress that people look at all sides of the story when it comes to stuff like this. Chances are the guy wasn't so cold and heartless that he would sit there and watch his friend die. He probably didn't realize what was going on.",haamm,1453496633.0
