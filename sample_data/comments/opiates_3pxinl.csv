Lol what is the ""legal threshold""? Lmao, so can a cop like smoke a dub of crack and not get in trouble, but if he does two dubs of crack its illegal? I dont get that. Also, you guys heard about that MD cop that got caught nodded the fuck out in his squad car at a construction site with a brick of dope in his trunk that he took/didn't log as evidence? Man, I'd kill to be that cop if I didn't get caught lmfao. Drugs 4 lyfe. *hella* fucked up tho how he arrests people for the shit, but does drugs himself.",,1445636395.0
