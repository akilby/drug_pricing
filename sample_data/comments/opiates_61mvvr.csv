Back in the day my wife was written a script for it and I had read that promethazine potentiates opiates so I decided to take some. Worst decision of my life! It close to bed time when I took them and I went to bed shortly after only to wake up in the middle of the night due to the most intense stomach pains I've ever had in my life. Literally was just like OP, screaming and clutching my stomach. I jumped outta bed and immediately dropped on the floor when the worst wave of pain hit me, I was on the floor in the fetal position. My wife woke up flipping the fuck out because I was legit screaming in pain. I was in no condition to drive so she called my brother and he came all the way to my house and picked me up and dropped me off at the ER. As soon as I was admitted to the ER they drug tested me and gave me some other bullshit for nausea. They checked me to make sure I didn't have appendicitis and put me in some expensive ass machine to check my stomach. They also told me I was extremely constipated and prescribed me some shit for that. All in all it was a huge waste of time and my pussy ass should have just fought the pain and or stayed home and died. ",JhayGhotti33,1490563666.0

dfgvooj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/61mvvr/never_take_random_pills/,t1_dfghybb,"Yah you're correct on all of this. The naloxone added to pain pills serves two purposes. One is it apparently reduces constipation and the other is it stops people from abusing the pills and shooting them.

As far as the difference between naloxone and naltrexone, same class of drug but yes as you said they are used differently and not the same drug. Naltrexone is primarily used to treat opiate addiction by blocking your receptors and making it near impossible to use. 50mg a day is prescribed in this case and It's awful when used like this and a very unpleasant drug. However it's a miracle drug when used at low doses. (3-4.5mgs at night) it boosts endorphin production, it regulates the immune system and is amazing at treating a lot of auto-immune conditions like MS. When used at the low dose it also has the bonus side effect of making the person using it completely immune to physical dependency. I use daily and have quit a number of times and haven't had accute wd symptoms in 18 months since i started low dose naltrexone. Fkn brilliant drug, i dunno why everyone takes opiates daily and doesn't do this. Why would anyone go through that shit, waking up sick every morning feeling like death. Opiate wds are the absolute worst as most people here know thus being immune to it is just wonderful.  :)",,1490625286.0
