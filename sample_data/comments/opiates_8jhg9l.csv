Left the rehab i was staying at and like they told me, ""we'll drive to pick you up, bit youre on your own if you leave"". Dope killed the excrutiating pain.

Also you're 15 miles shits all over my distance, even with it being a one way trip lol.  I'd be surprised if anyone could top it, maybe if they completed a marathon with their d-boy waiting at the finish line. ",aaron62691,1526354661.0

Some days I put over 15 miles on my feet. Lots of stairs too. I think my record is 127 flights in one shift. The $$ was fantastic so it was very much worth it.
