dzrl9c0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8myrsw/cradling_myself_trying_not_to_relapse/,t3_8myrsw,"Something my therapist constantly reminds me of, and it's the hardest things for me in the fucking world; be kind to yourself.  You are in pain! You are not well! Don't beat yourself up, don't ""power through"", don't force yourself to do things you can't do right now. Don't focus on the things you \*can't\* have that will help. Focus on the things you \*can\* have that will help. If someone else were in pain with a bad back, think of how you would treat them, and treat yourself the same way. Don't say things to yourself that you'd beat the shit out of someone else for saying to your best friend, because YOU are dearer to yourself than your best friend is.   


Can you take ibuprofen for inflammation?  
Can you alternate heat and ice?  
Can you lie or sit in a comfortable position?  


It's also incredibly helpful to have something to fill your time. Do you write, make art, color in coloring books, read, watch bad movies, watch good movies, crochet or knit, scrapbook, journal, art journaling, anything? What do you do to fill your time that can be done lying down or can be altered to be done lying down/sitting?  


Do you have someone you can call to help you? A friend or family member? You need someone who can be with you so you're not alone, ruminating over what you can't have. Do you have a therapist that you go to who could help you figure out some things that will help? Also, as some others have said, this too will pass \(and it's so important to remember that, but so hard!\); it may pass like a kidney stone, but it's going to pass. You're going to be okay.   


Is there a doctor you can call about this pain? I know us chronic pain patients kind of poo\-poo non\-narcotic pain relief techniques but they may be your best hope here. There are trigger point injections that give temporary relief, there are epidurals, all kinds of things that can help that aren't pain pills. A good doctor will be able to not only assist you with getting those things, they'll be there for you to talk to about how much you want to avoid pain meds \(you don't have to tell them your personal story, a lot of the time telling them that a family member went through addiction and you're trying to avoid it will be enough\).   


And as always, we're all here for you when shit like this happens. There are a LOT of pain patients here who have been through the gamut of treatments and medicines and will be happy to listen and talk to you, myself included. You can do this. I have faith in you, from one person in pain to another. You got this!",Foxes_and_Fireflies,1527605670.0

All I’ve got is .3g of weed, it seems like everything sucks. I’ve stayed up the last 2 days straight, doctors haven’t diagnosed me with anything yet. All I want to do is pop a pill and sleep, opiates are the only thing that help

So what if today is garbage? Just let it be garbage. Tomorrow will come either way and hopefully bring something good and new with it. 

I try real hard to think that in crappy times. All I can really say is my advice to everyone when drugs aren't available or don't work or you don't want them: immerse yourself elsewhere. I like nosleep on Reddit... cause I can waste the whole day with them creepy ass stories and be shocked when it's 2am and I've forgotten the world.

Find something to lose your mind in for a while.

You'll get through it boo. You're stronger than me. Nine months is fucking AMAZINGGGG. I'm jealous. Don't break down now.",Chupacabraonfire,1527601576.0

I used to work for a natural food store and attended a training on CBD oil. We were told that CBD helps people at different doses. People who are using it to help with pain tend to need a higher dose than someone using it for anxiety. I found that 60-90mg of CBD made a noticeable difference in my pain (I was taking 30mg CBD oil soft gels) while my fiance was able to use 3mg oil (it was a tincture, 1 dropper was 3mg) and stop his panic attacks when he felt them coming on. The dose makes a HUGE difference, we always told customers to start low and work their way up until they felt a difference.",googier526,1527637724.0

Take like 6 of the 800s and 99% of your anxiety will be gone, It has totally removed any symptoms of RLS(restless leg syndrome) in my experiences, as well as a few friends who have had similar success.
It would also put me in a tolerable mood, remove racing thoughts when i would try to go to bed. Basically i swear by these things. If im doin any kind of opis for a few days straight i HAVE TO HAVE my gaba!
You wont be able to just cold cop em off the street. You need to know someone with a script...or know a guy who knows a guy.
I have been getting scripts since 2008 when they were prescribed for nerve pain...i never took them i just filled them and hoarded them....years later i read an article on blue light about gabapentins use in opiate withdrawals. It basically confirmed that gaba in large doses helps greatly reduce symptoms of withdrawal.",bigdaddy723,1527618634.0

She even came to visit me on my first day when I was in the psych ward. I was in a really bad place and had been texting her, keeping her posted on whether or not I was going, how I was doing, and she was keeping me grounded through the whole process. I was supposed to have an appointment with her the day after I checked in and told her I obviously wasn't going to be able to make it. I didn't expect her come in to see me the next day and have our appointment like usual, and I started bawling as soon as she popped her head in the room. She really didn't have to do that and could have just left me to the hospital staff, you know?

It helps me sometimes to remind myself that if she, a stranger who doesn't know me beyond my diagnoses of PTSD/anxiety/bipolar 2/depression and my appointments with her, can believe in me I can believe in me too.",Foxes_and_Fireflies,1527629450.0
