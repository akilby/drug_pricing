You could also choose instead to see a Psychiatrist that specializes in addiction, if you'd rather keep that knowledge separate from your GP. If your GP prescribes the benzos you take, discontinuing those is the only bad thing that could happen and if I were him, I wouldn't do it. 

Some physicians (actually many, these days) are SO worried about liability, and knowing that you're taking them with benzos could concern them even more. If all of that is the case, seen a psychiatrist that specializes in addition. Not only can they prescribe, but being specialists they are best suited to help you with the opioid use as well. 

Much love <3 and best of luck!",DJHF206,1500342500.0

I did this recently and the doctor went from treating my like normal to treating me like I had Ebola.  It was honestly pretty infuriating bc I was asking for help and he would have had no idea about my problems if I hadn't straight up told him.  I keep my family well dressed and fed, pay the bills, and keep a job that supports all that so unless I'm being a shady piece of shit spare me the judgement.",needtopass00,1500408887.0

Whether you decide to take it or not is still up to you but self diagnosing and medicating yourself is a dangerous game. Hear them out maybe they can help.,FlipFlopSuicide,1500338144.0

I attended a methadone clinic for over 5 years, went to a doctor who prescribed me methadone due to substance abuse for 2 years, and just recently went to another doc about my addiction issues (and he was a total pos about it) and I still get pain meds prescribed.
