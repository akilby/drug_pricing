Any of the partial agonists (oxycodone, hydrocodone, morphine, oxymorphone, hydromorphone, fentanyl) can be mixed and not cancel out. ",Catman12000,1544996720.0

Oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl etc are full agonists. ",Butterfly-opacities,1544996979.0

Also I’ve heard kratom can also block opioid receptors from some opioids?",Gh011,1544997894.0
