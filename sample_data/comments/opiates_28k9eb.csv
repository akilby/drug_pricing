They look much too recently pressed to be street pharmacy, and to add to that some of the pills look to be made in the exact same press when really they are different dimensions. Also the colouring is off and any user experienced with the real ones would probably be able to tell by comparison. 

Also when looking at the pills side by side with each other they look very inconsistent and on some the lettering is off Center. Did they have any taste to them?",retroshark,1403196507.0

cicbob6,http://imgur.com/qtetRw1,t1_cic6cbn,"Yeah but they aren't even correctly matching the pill they are imitating for the most part. The red ones should have a 60, not an 80, some of the 40's are gold-ish not yellow like they should be. Some say OP, some OC. The green ""80's"" imprint is totally wrong, way small and even wrong font. I bet if u cut them in half they would be that same color all the way thru as well and we all kno OCs are white inside under the coating. If these did come from some Middle East pill mill then they prob have some sort of benzo or possibly opiate if they actually are keeping ur friend from getting wds/sick. But how big is his tolerance? Is he physically dependent on opies or just takes them occasionally. Would need someone with a daily habit to tell for sure what or how strong these are if ur friend is just a chipper per say. Interesting none the less u always see ads for these things online and I always wonder what is actually in them but my guess is it prob varies due to how sketchy these look. 

Side question: anyone ever see those 80's in the red/yellow blister pack that have 80mg oxy and 650mg Tylenol? It even says ""produced for Purdue pharmaceuticals on the front"". They look more legit then these do but damn what a waste of an 80 to put a whopping 650mg of nasty apap with it.   ",Suddenrush,1403248988.0
