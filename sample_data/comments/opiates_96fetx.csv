Washed it down with a bottle of beer. It was ok. Not great, but it was something. Now i am completely dry. Only a few xanax pills left. I am so fucked.

Would you eat 20 on their own? Or 20 morphine on top of 20-30mg oxycodone?",iwanttomakesense,1534027550.0

I’m on about 150-300 mg of morphine a day, so 5 mg ain’t even remotely close to getting well if I was in withdrawal. If you take both, I guess it all just depends on your tolerance..",eflood05,1534043811.0
