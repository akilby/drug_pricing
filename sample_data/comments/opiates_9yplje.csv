Go back 2 years and I have some post history of desperate shots I did while the heat was off in the winter with no food and I was spending my last $40 to go cop. Life is very different today but it’s only because the hope I see in all the beautiful people on this sub, you guys have saved me countless time I come back here to remember what it’s like waking up sick and waiting. If you struggling hang in there you can do it, I couldn’t stop OD’ing or get a needle out of my arm, today I have all that superficial bull shit and that’s not what even makes me happy. Watching someone like me get 1 day clean is the new hit for me, I love you guys and I believe in you, thank you ",Shaou_Lin,1542696028.0

I remember you and your posts from back in the day, you always were posting some interesting things from what I remember. That's also exactly what I needed to hear, as I prepare to face a 4 day detox over this long 4 day weekend I have off from work for the holidays cuz it's the only time I have a solid chance at kicking and stabilizing myself for work by Monday even though I know I won't be 100% by then.",clickclvck,1542702492.0
