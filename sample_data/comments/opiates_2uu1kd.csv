Sorry I'm not expanding more on this, lazy and tired.

I chipped for a couple years; I found it really helpful to mark using days on a calendar. I had this rule of threes where I would never use three days in a row and always try to separate use sessions by three days. Everyone is different. If you don't have strong willpower, you could get one of those time-lock safe things online. I'm a daily user right now (it suits me better at this point in life, I'm also on subs for days when I don't use and considering a detox) but I don't see why /r/opiates acts like nobody can control opiate use. Just be careful, yaknow? It's hard, but there are plenty of things that are harder.",,1423114275.0

Moved to CO a few months ago and got clean for the first time in years, found a conect and thought I could chip on the weekends. Its 10x harder then if you were never addicted. It will seem under control for the first few months and then it just ""happens"" and you start getting minor w/ds and then say to yourself fuck if I'm getting sick I might as well use again.
