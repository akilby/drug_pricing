Pretty boring day for real.  Tried watching TV for a bit but all they were talking about was the election obviously and for real, we know who won we don't need 24 hour analysis on it anymore. 

Not even ESPN was safe.  They were talking about the social meaning of Tom Brady supporting Trump and LeBron James supporting Clinton and if it meant that most Americans were more like Brady than James or something. 

Played Xbox. Ate some chicken noodle soup. Finished the last of this blow I was given.  Drank a beer. 

Man, I need a hobby.  That shit was depressing to write lol. ",Officer_Coldhonkey,1478748082.0

saved me tons of money and hassle trying to buy them at normal pharmacies, had 3 different pharmacists in my home town give me a dirty look and turned me down whereas the needle exchange workers are the nicest bunch you will probably ever meet. 

gonna try and hit the sack till it sack pick up time lol.",new_usernaem,1478769998.0
