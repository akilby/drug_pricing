d4ju769,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4pcgz8/has_anyone_ever_had_success_with_using_suboxone/,t1_d4js37o,"That's a matter of opinion. On a 1-2mg dose of suboxone, if you wait a good 8 hours, and use a higher dose, you can still feel your shot. If you're a working person with a 9 - 5 who doesn't want to be completely wrecked and nodding at their desk, and can afford it, its not necessarily a waste. ",Dupxran,1466625743.0

Also, when you're using with suboxone already in your system, did you usually wait until you started to feel sick to take your next dose of suboxone? I'm a little unclear about what happens in your brain when you shoot through bupe; does the dope dislodge the bupe to take its place and then when the dope wears off the bupe refills the receptors, or does it never leave them, and the dope just takes effect on the ones that aren't occupied with bupe?",Dupxran,1466641341.0

Anytime I've done dope after sub I always wanna kick myself in the ass for wasting dope and doing a shot I only feel 25% of. I just don't see the point of being on subs and trying to blast thru it with dope.",morefiend,1466627138.0
