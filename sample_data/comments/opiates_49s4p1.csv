Coughing up blood is not okay, and it may be even worse, you might be coughing up pieces of your lung. They may be collapsed/collapsing. Either way, wtf are you doing posting here about it? Go now!

But you didn't die. If you had died, we would not be reading this post right now, because you would be dead. 

Second of all, you are coughing up blood and it hurts to breathe? You should REALLY get that checked out and be sure to tell the doctor that you recently overdosed. The trouble breathing is because your lungs filled up with fluid after overdosing-- it's called ""heroin-induced non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema,"" and it's what I had a few weeks ago when I was in the ICU for 4 days. My other diagnoses were ""acute respiratory failure"" and ""severe sepsis,"" so you may want to think about getting yourself back to the hospital ASAP. Like, NOW. 

The coughing up blood thing may be because your lungs are all raw now... I'm not really sure about that one, but everything else sounds exactly like what I had, and that was scary as shit. My lungs basically said ""fuck you, i'm not going to work anymore"" and my blood oxygen levels were scary low. Don't wait. Go get checked out.
