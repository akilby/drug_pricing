I try to make sure I have more pills filled with the normal medicine, but it just depends on how much I've got with me. If I am able to mix the regular pills in with the dope, I find a way to mark the dope pills somehow. Usually I just take a marker and make a dot somewhere.

I'm a guy, so cant really do the purse or makeup bag idea (unless I want even more attention lol), but the pen idea is perfect. I might go ahead and cut off the plastic wings that stick out for your fingers yo hold. Because without those, it probably wouldn't look much different than a pen on an xray?. I might also pull the plunger out to help it not look like a needle even more.
