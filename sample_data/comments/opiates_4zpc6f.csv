You just need to use enough Liquid to cover the seeds and then have an inch of room, and if you are using the right seeds and make the tea right, 1 gram of seeds should equal  about 1.5 of morphine (which is about 30% absorbed). 

So 100 grams (1/5 pound) of the right seeds can be as strong as about 40mg of Oxycodone. I just want to make sure you know that. ",BernieForWi,1472234316.0

thats the rinse of 4 pounds of seeds. im always terrified im going to waste stuff, so i wash my seeds 3 times. i use a 2 liter bottle and 1.875 pounds seed per bottle. cover with ice cold water, shake 3 mins. loosen cap, squeeze liquid through.

its bitter and works great for the money. sadly, i think my local retailer knows whatsup.lol. they keep the seeds behind the counters here ",AccntNmbr4,1472313511.0

Also, you mean 1.5 mg of morphine / 1 gram of seeds? So 100 grams means 150 mg of morphine? That would be equivalent to about 100 mg of oxycodone...

There must be far less than 1.5 mg of morphine / gram",xxxSEXCOCKxxx,1472253822.0
