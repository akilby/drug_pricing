I could provide dozens of recent articles, peer reviewed or by experts in their fields which demonstrate and argue why addiction is not a disease. 

That would largely be a waste of my time though so would be pointless. It appears the majority of those who believe in, or that they have been helped by the disease model have their mind made up and that is that. I have no interest in opening closed minds, we all have to do that for ourselves. If it works for you, work it!

If the disease model is so successful though, then why are it’s treatment methods success rates so low?  12 Step success rates for example are currently though to be between %5-%10.

In fact, more people quit substance use disorder by doing nothing more than quitting on their own and moving on in their life. How is that possible if addiction is a disease? 

I’m sure you’re aware of the research into the vets who came back from Vietnam addicted to heroin, how were so many able to simply quit and fall back into their family, work social routine without ever using again?

The disease models main defenders now are the treatment centres and their luxury rehabs with low operating costs and ginormous profits.  Not that they would be biased against anything that threatens their billion dollar gravy train....",Starfire36,1546777707.0

Something thought up in the 30s still being used when we should be using a much more scientific approach. Medication Assisted Therapy has the highest success rates for opiate abuse disorder.
