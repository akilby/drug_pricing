Trainspotting is cool, I love this movie. But I find that it doesn't accurately portray the junkie lifestyle, there's some glamourizing into it.

Requiem for a Dream is a piece of trash (Edit: okay, it's not. I was too extreme. This movie's just not that good IMO). Seems like an anti drug tv commercial, and man seeing those fucking dilated pupils when they shoot up makes me angry.

It is NOT a piece of trash - actually, I like how the mother's amphetamine (and TV) addiction is portrayed and how accurately her episode of psychosis is demonstrated in the end. Hell, even the photography is awesome. When I watched it I got really nervous and deep into it, as if I was living the characters' experiences.

I've actually watched the whole movie twice. What I don't really like is the whole ""horror story"" aspect every scene is given. What bothers me is the extremism - like, 1 day you begin using heroin, then you lose your arm and your girlfriend participates on some kind of pornographic ""ass to ass"" nightmare in order to not be dope sick... But what about the characters' personality? I still know nothing about them! This whole ""See people, that's why you shouldn't do drugs"" thing just isn't for me.

I know that being a heroin addict brings many shitty events to our lives, but this kind of drama - with almost no character development - just isn't my thing.

Isn't that enough? Isn't that the point of a movie, to make you feel engaged and drawn into the story? It's a movie about drug usage, the highs and lows, and any character development if at all present is just a bonus, and not a critical part of the movie. It may seem like all the events happen quickly, but you have to remember that it happens over a long period of time; there's no way (or reason to)  to show all the boring, ""regular"" days when they aren't at rock bottom. 

I don't think it was as great as it's hyped up to be, but I don't think it's nearly as bad as some may say it is either. It's definitely memorable though, and I think that's as good as it gets for this specific movie. I enjoyed it, and it seems like you enjoyed it to an extent as well. Your English is perfectly sufficient for expressing your opinion, and I'm glad you edited your comment since you realized that the movie isn't a piece of trash since you were able to become engrossed in the story & the characters' lives, but rather you just disliked a certain thing about it - and that's okay.",moclov4,1388821441.0
