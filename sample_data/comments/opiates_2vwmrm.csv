Why? How does it make sense? She also sits, rather than standing, on her patio. Why? Because her neighbors will see her. At least their was a reason for that one. It's still a sign of some sort of anxiety or paranoia or schizo-? something. I thought it was cute the first night when we cuddled under a blanket, sitting right on the patio floor...oops, nope, that bit of cuteness was actually just her way of adapting to the need to sit on a freezing cold floor to **prevent her neighbors from seeing her at all.** That's not normal. Writing an in-depth sext, maybe as long as this message here, that may be a little odd. But it's hard to extrapolate that to indicate that I am defective and that she's ""right"" to break off an otherwise pleasurable physical relationship.

I'm not small but im not huge. I already knew all the girl I dumped friends. I was just partyer back then. I was seeing her she thought it was more than it was. For context evertime I hooked up with a chick my ex would pop back up. Some kind of sick game she would play to make sure I still wanted her. She would play with me for a couple days and split.

The girl I talked into coming over already had a thing for me. I left that out for coolness of story. I was actually hooking up with her at the party before the girl I started seeing but she got chocolate wasted and started puking everywhere. The best part is her mom was a judge. Totally cool lady. Got me off on a BS weed charge. I had .01 grams in a bag. So like an empty fucking bag. I just woke up and its hard to make this make sense. 

EDIT: This was 13 years ago. I lived in a smallish wealthy town. I was dirt poor moved out when I was 16 had a job quit school had my own place. So the rich girls loved to use me to get at their parents. I was from SoCal and had an attitude that reflected that. So in small rich town Washington I did very well with the young ladies. That has changed a lot. They went to college I worked on my drug game.  Interesting side story, my ex used to tell girls that were interested in me that my dick was huge so the virgins were scared of it. Cock blocked my own cock, except its not huge. I found out years later she was doing this when a couple girls told me about it.

I enjoy just taking the Addy sublingually. That ups the absorption big time. And I also swallow a little bit of baking soda, which also serves to alkalinate (i.e. basify aka make it less acidic) one's mouth, increasing absorption sublingually further, and which increases the absorption from the stomach a lot.

Shooting crystal was awesome, and being on crystal is awesome, but i feel like the stuff i had had nasty cuts in it, which is why Adderall just leaves me feeling great and the crystal felt awesome but also felt ""dirty"" i.e. truly seemed like it took a worse physical toll than it should have. I'm not one to just throw out the vague claim that a hit of something was ""dirty"" but I think most dope shooters have had a shot where something was wrong, a bad cut, or even cotton fever, that's what I mean by dirty.

Coke has that amazing rush, and I used to LOVE to do it all fucking day long, or, even better, I remember a few speedballs that brought me out of minor sickness that I shot at a friends house years ago, and I would do the shot, push the stuff under the bed, and just walk out into the friend's garden, into that california sun. Holy shit was that awesome. But other than that, the coke is too harsh.

So, I just do the oral adderall, sublingual, with baking soda, for maximum bang. I'd love to shoot Molly, did you have relatively pure MDMA when you shot it?

Outside of her ex, she's never mentioned abuse, and I actually gave her a pretty damn irresistible opening to discuss such things, without requiring any detail or anything, just a few days ago. 

Even still, I can't imagine how my text could have been a trigger for abuse memories... it was very much not a rough sex sext but rather just a pretty ""vanilla"" (which is how she described ""normal sex"", in a pretty derisive manner, when we first talked about sex) type description of really working her, for her pleasure.

And she told me she missed her 'dom(inant)' which was something I didn't even ask her about after she mentioned it since I didn't see any reason to stir up jealous feelings about a girl I was only starting to get to know. The point is, what kind of girl would miss their former dom sex partner and then be re-traumatized by a description of pretty intense but 'vanilla' sex?

I just wrote about having sex. The part that threw her off, according to her, was that I said I wanted to see her cum as hard as a girl I watched in a video who cried from cumming, which I viewed as essentially the peak of cumming hard. It was just another way of saying, I want you to cum so fucking hard.

Anyways, so -- are you saying that you've never 'sexted' someone, as in written about having sex, what you want to do to/with them, what you want done to you, etc.?

And yes, it does sound creepy. So much of romance is extremely creepy if you look at it with rational eyes... to be perfectly honest, the type of thing (i.e. sleeping with her again and really going at it with no inhibitions with the kids gone) I was describing was the part that I think is actually NOT creepy -- it's the good part, the part after you actually have a partner you trust and feel safe around (e.g., after we'd met a handful of times, slept together, and she'd even called on me to help you with an unexpected health problem), the part where you get to enjoy yourself sexually and enjoy giving the same pleasure to another.

IDK. I'm glad I wasn't more attached, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't becoming more unenthusiastic about the effort I'm putting out there.

I always said I was OK (more than OK!) with casual sex, but given the extent to which losing this one partner is bothering me, IDK. Like I said, it's not bothering me TOO much, but it's still a bummer, and it makes me wonder why I can't even find a friend with benefits quickly... I guess I'd be better off looking for someone in real life than on Tinder, I think that there is a sizable portion of tinder that is really fucking crazy, and that goes for the girls, too. We get to see the creepy guys PMs posted on the net, but the girls can be really fucking weird, too, I think they just tend to save it for after a polite exchange or 10 have been had, and by then your average dude is already committed to seeing if he can't at least get laid out of it.",whataboutudummy,1423957466.0

It actually just sounds like me speaking about sex, I used the voice recognition thing and just...talked. I only mentioned the girl in the video momentarily, and I had actually mentioned the girl a few days ago with no ill effect, so I doubt it was that... maybe she just got scared because the text was pretty long, like, I sent it on android and when it came over to her iPhone it was probably like, idk, several screens worth of text...but if she read it, I don't know why it would scare... I think she's just paranoid, so long text message immediately means I'm a psycho killer or a stalker who wants to hurt her kids, when I ask her if something feels good, she immediately jumps to the idea that I wouldn't be asking how she felt unless I was disappointed with her.

Anyways, I've realized my IRL friends I talked to about her are right: I'm a sucker for tight/good pussy and weed, and this girl had both, and she was going to keep being shitty to me. Yeah, she was just barely starting to become a known quantity in my head, yet she was already being downright shitty verbally. I'm not the kind of guy to take that shit lying down, and I didn't, I confronted her about it. But, the truth is, there's no way someone who is doing that the second or third time they meet you -- ""doing that""=being rude and disrespectful, out of nowhere, like a switch flipped -- is going to be likely to change.

I'm done chasing girls who can't show as much appreciation for me as I show for them, particularly when I know that I'm giving them good loving or, if they won't take that, at least good physical affection and some kind of bedroom friendship.

Happy valentine's to you, I've gotten so much hate on this thread.

Wow, I should have used some discretion and edited my post rather than just barfing up all my feelings on stims and expecting a good reaction. ~~I don't think people are capable of dealing with lengthy writing on here... it's like, idk what it's like, but it's a shame.~~ I think they're assuming that since my post is so wordy, I must've just like sent her the most insane screed about sexual weeping when in reality i sent a pretty normal sex related text and she's fucking schizo or something 

Whether it's why she decided she won't be seeing me anymore or not, I honestly believe she either is diagnosed with some mental issue that involves serious, irrational paranoia without being treated successfully (she's intelligent, with a masters in a relatively hard science from a good school, yet her rationality is not saving her from these weird, paranoid worries and concerns), or she just has some condition that causes moderate paranoia, e.g. being afraid to be seen by neighbors (because they're too nosy -- about her having a fucking cig on the patio -- even though the neighbors are across such an unusually wide intersection/road that they may as well not exist as far as her worries about them watching and judging her for smoking. Another e.g., after sharing a very little bit about her family's history/heritage/ethnicity, that type of thing, (she was actually speaking with excitement, which made me happy, about being raised by her grandmother with the 'full island experience'), I asked her for more detail (which detail was her grandmother from? right? pretty normal question...) and she got paranoid (I assume, I can't come up with another explanation) and decided that she could not share any more info about it. 

Bottom line, I sent a perfectly acceptable text about sex to a woman I'd already had sex with...repeatedly...recently...a girl who had mentioned a ""dom that she misses so much"". Ya know, ""The Dom That Got Away"", we all have one of those, right? I mean, come on? S&M is in, but a text that just describes us fucking in a relatively normal and certainly not scary way is a problem?  

Well, on the upside, she served as confirmation of my developing theory that I'm becoming more attractive to some black girls/women. On the other hand, all these black girls/women seem crazy as fuck and are more or less exclusively into white boys, and unfortunately, I haven't gotten to know any of these girls well enough to know what the hell led to that. Either way, unless they're all bad crazy, this is good for me, because I (theoretically sort of white?) can say that I feel about black girls (people) the way Ginger Baker apparently did. I'd love to have some beautiful biracial kids some day. I just need to learn drums like Ginger.

And guess what? As soon as I got back on tinder today, my very first fucking match was another black girl, and she responded to me immediately... The crazy one that dumped me today was obsessed with my hair, I'm going to try and figure out if that is what's with these black girls that are into me... I'd ask the one I was chatting up today, but my phone fucking died and my charger decided to call it quits today, as well. 

Edited: removed what sounded like a mean put-down toward the girl's appearance/physicality re her hair, even though it wasn't meant that way and was just honest. Also removed the word ""b****"", because it's not funny in this context and obviously I have no reason to be angry or mean to her, especially since I think she's fucking mental ill in a way that there might not be some easy FIX for, something we should all thank god exists for our conditions.",whataboutudummy,1423958030.0

Man, that oral adderall...i've been there done that with the two big boy stims, and taken them in the more direct routes, but i'll be damned if addy isn't a potent, no-joke stim in its own right that will make you feel SOOO much like you're on meth but the comedown is way less bad. Because it is meth. Minus the meth part.

And we give this shit to 8-year olds! WTF!

I know why you said you'd stick to the downers, stims can be rough, and can make others look foolish online. I know I was relieved when I escaped the clutches of an IV cocaine ""habit""...BUT, I've gotta say, if you have some downers to manage the edges of the experience (basically plenty of opis and benzos and definitely modest amounts of alcohol which greatly enhance the experience), Adderall is more than strong enough to get your party started, get you talking (but preferably not writing, face to face or just conversating you get those visual/verbal/etc. cues to shut the fuck up and keep yourself in line), and just generally give you a ton of energy and positive energy at that: I could've been really bitchy about the girl that put me down today, but I wasn't...partially because I genuinely feel pity for her because I don't know what her problem is but I believe that it is real and serious, but also partially because this shit had me feeling so sunny when I got that rank news.

What I'm saying is that compared to coke and meth, I think plain old mixed amphetamine salts (generic adderall) is a fucking great choice. This was apropos of nothing other than your post a few above here, and the fact that you smiled at me! :)
