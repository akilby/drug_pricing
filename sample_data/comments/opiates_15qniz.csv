Feels fucking good after being anxious and jittery from coming down from a ton of amphetamine for a few hours. Happy New Years, brothaz. It's already 10 at night here in Viking Country so the fireworks have started somewhat. Raining like a motherfucker outside, so I'm happy with my decision to stay home instead of partying with friends. Nothing like sitting inside in a comfy chair when it's cold and raining outside, wooly slippers on my feet and headphones on my head and heroin in my brain. Dat feel when you're coming up on a large (for you) dose of heroin after being sober for 3 days. It's like my brain is having an orgasm. Sadly I'm starting to get a bit nauseous because this dose is quite high for me - This is the most potent heroin I've had in my life - but I'll soldier through it!

I'm so happy. Hope you're all doing well this festive evening... I can't get over how good I'm feeling. So chill. So warm. So happy. My brain is melting. Ahhhh... I just shed a tear 'cause of happiness. So awesome that you can still get these feels after using heroin for a year by simply keeping your use from escalating.

I'll stop rambling now. Dopamine has this effect on me. Peace out brothaz, sistaz <3",,1356990151.0

Amphetamines always make me anxious and give me the chills(which is why I rarely ever use them unless I'm speed balling) and opiates do the exact opposite.
