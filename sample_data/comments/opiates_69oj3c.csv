Also alcohol and acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a terrible combo for your liver anyway (Google for more info).

Take the Oxy and go out and have a soda or coffee or something. You'll have a better night anyway, and no hangover the next day! ",OllyOxNfree,1494119427.0

I wouldn't really recommend mixing with alcohol period.",,1494117634.0
dh882dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/69oj3c/oxycodone_and_alcohol/,t3_69oj3c,With all due respect gentleman. OP itll be ok if you take a few of the oxys and drink some booze.  Their only 5s and havong a few drinks in my opinion has been fine.  I did the same newbie to opis and drank and never had issues.  Keep it mellow and youll be ok.  Dont over do it.  Also depends on you alchy tolerance. If you usually drink than taking a few shouldnt be a problem.,Johnny_Cockring,1494121305.0
