Wait for it..

$20-25 a stamp.. and a stamp HERE? Is lucky to be .02-.03.. Most of the time it's garbage, bundles range from $150-200, half G's are minimum $125.

It's ridiculous.",shiggydigs13,1475871460.0

Very glad things are sold by weight in my neck of the woods, and if I get shorted I know right away because I check. I then proceed to voice my complaint with the dealer, and normally my main guy will make it right and toss extra for the trouble.",lol_like_for_realz,1475871941.0

Buns are obviously supposed to be a gram in theory but usually they're much less, probably like .5 if you're lucky.  I've had some wildly varying amounts of powder, though i've never weighed anything out.  But I've noticed I'll get stamps with little powder and it's usually equivalent to the stamps that have 3-4x more powder in them; the dope % is usually similar but the fat stamps have way more cut to make them look more appealing im assuming",im_behind_7_proxies,1475872714.0
d8igchz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/56daw3/now_i_remember_why_i_got_off_the_big_horse/,t3_56daw3,Never got 20 worth all sold In stamps here and you can't cop less than a bundle out this way which costs 60-70 bought individually and about 50 in a brick. .5g per bundle usually. So basically grams are like 100-120 but the quality varies if you cop cold. Sometimes it's fire sometimes it's garbage. Mostly it's mediocre. ,piperidones,1475876209.0
