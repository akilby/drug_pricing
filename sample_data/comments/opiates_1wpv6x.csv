It's why you see all sorts of research chemicals for hallucinogens, benzos and mdma but will very very rarely see any sort of opiate research chemicals.

God damn it every time I see or read a piece of his, I rage a little at the amateur hour on display, he's not even really very funny or clever; something you can honestly laugh at spills out of the guy on roughly the frequency of which Halley's Comet swings by... and the worst part is I don't think he really even likes any drugs that much. And fuck his style is too hipster and not enough hip. Though being the former does exclude the latter and vice-versa, I'd say working for Vice even the most stirred hipster gets a chance to walk the hip line... No personal offence to the guy but he should be doing a different segment. This piece is so uninspired, light Wikipedia summaries with 2-bit color commentary, and the anecdotal/urban legend tales straight jacked off Bluelight or DrugsForum... The posts aren't hard to find and some cursory but deeper than the kiddie pool surfing for one to three hours would pull those pieces out... for the amount of surfing I've done on the subject, I've come across those posts probably fifty times, I know exactly where the entire article comes from piece-by-piece...

Although his narratives can be very boring and monotonous, he is actually very intelligent in the field of chemistry and the synthesizing chemicals/substances. One thing that I didn't like about this article of his though was that in multiple points throughout the article, he will be talking about a certain opiate, saying it's the strongest in the world, and then two paragraphs later, he will make a new statement about how there's actually an even stronger opiate that was synthesized in some other country even though he had just previously stated in the same article that there was no opiate stronger than the one that was previously listed.

also, consider when the russians used gaseous 3-methyl-fentanil to immobilize the chechens and consequently killed the terrorists and many innocents during the 2002 theater siege.
