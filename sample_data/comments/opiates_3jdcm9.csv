Don't make it sound like you're seeking. Just say something like ""Doc, I'm still having some pain in my leg. Is it safe to combine tylenol/ibuprofen/aleve with suboxone? Do you know when it will start feeling better?""

Does the suboxone actually help at all? When I was on suboxone for 5 months after quitting my pain was worse than ever. Even after that period where you no longer have those nasty aches/pains *just* from withdrawals... If that makes sense.",blissfullynodding,1441211078.0

cuon8jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jdcm9/questions_regarding_suboxone_for_pain_management/,t3_3jdcm9,"Bumping up suboxone won't help with the pain unfortunately. Most pain patients take < 1 mg IV since it's the norbuprenorphine that really helps with pain, and past 1 mg the amount of norbuprenorphine doesn't really increase. You might need to talk to your doctor about a new painkiller or auxiliary meds.",Terriberri2,1441232166.0
cuorjli,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jdcm9/questions_regarding_suboxone_for_pain_management/,t3_3jdcm9,Yea idk if it's me but I take subutex and it doesn't do jack shit for pain for me at least. It's one significant reason I loved opiates so much. I actually felt my damn age. I'm 22 goddamnit I should be in my prime! Yet my bones hurt my joints are fucked. Be honest and sinscere is my suggestion.,pinkgreengreybluerox,1441240139.0
cuoccjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jdcm9/questions_regarding_suboxone_for_pain_management/,t1_cuo9pje,Yes actually.  It helps more than anything I've taken for pain thus far (well except heroin of course). I can get up walk around and all that.  I feel more moble.  My problem is I would like to get a job soon and a leisurely  day off is in no way comparable  to an 8hr shift standing up all day.  My doctor told me they usually start people on suboxone lower for pain management  and bump u up if needed.  and since the last time I used an opiate was over a month and a half ago I wasn't in withdrawal and tolerance was low.

The subs definitely  help fir my pain and honestly, I made this post yesterday and today it was like no pain at all.  Maybe it's just a day by day thing for me",tandemthruthenight,1441334218.0
cuq0uyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/3jdcm9/questions_regarding_suboxone_for_pain_management/,t1_cuorjli,"Hey I'm 22 as well and I did tons of  opiates.   Then, my kidneys got all fucked up and one of the bi products  of that incident was chronic leg pain.  Fortunately, the subs do help.  Some days it still fucking sucks and some days like today, was a pretty low pain day.  So I can to some degree, given our simple age and chronic pain backgrounds, can empathize  with you.  It sucks for us youngins  because no doctor wants to start someone so young on a life where they will need to rely on opiates for the rest of their life.",tandemthruthenight,1441334497.0

How long has it been since you've been put on it? You basically just want to show your doc that you're trying to make due with the dose you're on and not rushing to a higher dose, that's all.",blissfullynodding,1441215914.0

It's awesome but at the same time really sad to know that someone knows what it's like.. Funny thing is, I never really looked at myself as a chronic pain victim until I quit doing regular opiates.. subs definitely help to some degree for me WAYYYYY better than without for damn sure.. But oxycodone takes it all away... I wish I never abused it as now if I want to be a pain mgmnt patient I will become a total addict all over again.
