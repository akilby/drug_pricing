I normally wait 48 hrs, but being that you only took 1 mg u may be good in 24.  If you take it too soon it won't make u sick, you just won't get the full effect because bupe is occupying your receptors.",oxyctznbrspctlrtb,1501028827.0

It depends on how often and the amount of subs that you use. 1mg isn't very much, but the pills you have aren't that strong either though...

IMO? I doubt you'll feel much of anything and you should probably wait it out until you're at least past the 24hr mark. ",The_New_Spagora,1501028827.0

I tried that same scenario earlier this summer and I probably only felt about 1/3 of the effects that I usually do off the same amount (dilly btw) I was pretty disappointed. One of those times where the D girl wasn't coming through all day, so I was sick all day. Finally got my hands on half of a 2 mg sub pill from a cab driver. Naturally, about an hour later my dgirl is good to go. ",,1501029199.0
