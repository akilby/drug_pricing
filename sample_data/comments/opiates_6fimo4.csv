Your past sounds really rough and it will quickly go back to that if you do. If being around this sub is too hard you should check out r/opiatesrecovery. I've personally found better support and made a lot of good connections over here but I could understand the pictures and whatnot being too triggering if I were trying to be clean for the long haul. 19 months is incredible.
