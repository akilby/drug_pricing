If someone is a more habitual drug or pill user, Kratom might not be anything special. I know people who use Kratom for WD, or after quitting they just use Kratom.

If someone is seeking other options other than illegal or prescription drugs, Kratom might be a good choice.

I recommend people try it. Maybe twice, and a different brand if they didn't like the first one ",ManslaughterMary,1543453930.0
