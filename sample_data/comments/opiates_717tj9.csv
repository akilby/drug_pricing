Adding fentanyl to heroin makes it stronger and a dealer can just cut fentanyl and sell it as is and make huge profits because of how little fentanyl needs to be used. At this point I know many many people who prefer heroin cut with fentanyl or just straight fentanyl because of the strength. I just met two very young users who said they haven't ever done heroin they started on fentanyl and prefer it. Its absolutely crazy but makes sense. ,travs3dpe,1505875177.0

We're getting all of this fent analogues now because of the Chinese labs making and shipping it here in the mail. That along with smugglers probly moving larger amounts in as well.

I personally HATE any fent analogues, shits not nearly as euphoric, and i can't stand dope that I'm sick 2 hours after a half gram shot",Joe11290,1505884594.0

The majority of the dope in town is fent and all the users do it. Doing it isn't a death sentence first use. I started off with it so now I can't get any sort of high from H. ,,1505876863.0

Oxycodone, hydrocodone,  heroin etc.  Must all be extracted and converted from opium as raw material.  Much cheaper to create fully synthetic fent in a lab or Chinese alley.

dn8u1kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/717tj9/why_fentanyl/,t1_dn8tr33,The problem is street level dealers are not smart enough to understand ratios to cut the fentanyl and also don't have the proper equipment to mix it enough that it would be a relatively safe amount. Also they don't know the difference between carfentanyl and fentanyl and this is the reason people are dying. ,travs3dpe,1505875725.0
