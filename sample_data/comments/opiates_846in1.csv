I had a reaction when using Sensodyne with Sub, it caused the almost like a chemical burn under my tongue and around my throat.  Try change toothpaste or do not use it anytime within 45min of brushing your teeth (and gargle with water).

I’ve experienced the chemical burns from toothpaste before, but was in the form of skin from the inside of my cheeks peeling. Since that happened a few years ago I switched to a toothpaste called Verve for a bit that doesn’t have that chemical in it. I’ve been using the Sensodyne again tho in the past year as it feels cleaner.
I’ll give it a shot and switch back to the Verve, but at this point I’m worried I won’t be able to identify what’s going on with the major swelling, since I was given steroids etc. Another thing I take sublingually is a vitamin B tablet so laying off that too. Guess I’m just scared about being sensitive to Suboxone and relapsing etc. 
Maybe my Dentist will have some ideas, idk.",achemicaIreaction,1520972251.0

Edit: well saw three docs, including an oral surgeon and they all had no idea/shrugged. Next step is an allergist and in the meantime I’ve changed my ROA. Swelling is still there and my fingers are crossed I haven’t developed some sort of allergy to subs as they have helped so much.",achemicaIreaction,1520972251.0
