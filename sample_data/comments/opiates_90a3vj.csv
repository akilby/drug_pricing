I don’t deal with people being assholes or making a person look silly, instead of simply answering a question that’s being asked, from someone who’s legitimately just trying to understand..",eflood05,1532048211.0

A lot of things might be obvious to you, but to the people asking questions  about things that may be obvious to you or I, it isn’t to that particular  person. Be respectful! A LOT of people come here as a refuge to ask questions without feeling judged and made a fool of!!! Respect that. 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼",eflood05,1532048394.0
