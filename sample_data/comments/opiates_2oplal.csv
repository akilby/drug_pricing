I.E. dose, slam energy drink, proceed to do cardio for like 2 hours. After about 20 minutes of running you start to get super fucking high bc of dat natural endorphin rush. 

Then go lift weights... squat, deadlift, etc... you probably do alright this way.

You can still make gains but your plateaus may be harder to break and more frequent. Some people refute the studies because the participation groups are relatively small, however, there are quite a few of these studies and the results are all very similar. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6247215 Also, opiates can also increase estrogen levels. 

I lifted when I was still using opiates and it will have an effect. The amount of effect will be determined by a few things some of which are lift schedule, intensity, diet, and whether you currently have any testosterone level issues.

I should add that I will buy testosterone from my oxy guy Atleast 1-2 times per year. The most important aspect of building or maintaining any muscle is to keep eating decent and lifting. That's where the opiates can fuck you up. I feel so tired and weak when I wake up that all I can think about is getting that beautiful blue powder into my nasal cavities and gut as fast as possible. And when it comes to dieting, there is no diet when I am high. I eat pure shit because I am an impulsive glutton while I am high. Luckily I got it down to where I will dose, ride out the nods, drink some pre workout and get my lifts in while I'm still high. For any shit you eat like mcdonalds or candy, try to eat the equivalent in protein, and greens. Also drink lots of water. That's my .02, hope it helps. 

Also test boosters do not work so don't waste your money. They can boost libido at best, but that's not happening while abusing opiates. ",BlueOxyCult,1418132431.0

I'm pretty sure they actually decrease *both* testosterone and estrogen levels, which is why you don't end up with manboobs when doing dope. It will nuke your hormone levels, but the ratios will still be somewhat intact, as far as I understand.

If opioids decreased test *and* increased estrogen, then all of us would pretty much look like transvestites. 

And yeah, OP: Doing opioids is pretty much the worst possible thing you can do if you're trying to gain muscle. Daily use will give you the testosterone levels of a 12 year old girl. If you're also doing steroids then it probably doesn't matter though.",,1418114959.0
