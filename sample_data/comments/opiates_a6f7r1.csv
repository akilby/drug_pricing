It feels like extreme relaxation coupled with euphoria (varies between different opiates). A simple explanation.,Pure-Rare,1544890608.0

You can experience the nod soberly, although I only ever have as a child.  I was about 8, on holiday in a very warm place, sitting on the balcony of the hotel room, falling asleep.  Opiate induced nod feels very similar, no problems on your mind, warm, loose, very tired.  The fun in the nod is fighting sleep, being so relaxed and sedated you're falling asleep but not wanting to so you can keep experiencing the feeling.

Are you writing an opiate addicted character, or something?",DrFeelFantastic,1544899974.0

It’s rolling a joint feeling fine then boom you’re completely in dreamland drooling and slumped over then coming back to it later with no sense of time on repeat.",CounterintuitiveMuir,1544900180.0

I do love a nod but I think chasing it every day leads to a pretty crappy life overall, since it's so easy to neglect yourself and others.",DrFeelFantastic,1544903207.0
