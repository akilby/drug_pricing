People or I should say me had no idea how dependent I was on subs till I ran out long enough for the withdrawel to set in. I've got / had a pretty serious IV dope habit and never needed more than a few mg to get me through the day.

dh56bxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/69ahw5/the_taste_of_suboxone_strips/,t1_dh54gw2,I'm glad you decided to stop then. Dangerous shot right there. Taper down that sub I would say. Try 8mg per day and then drop if you feel okay. It's better than fent anyway A good luck man. ,Dropzoned,1493939303.0
dh54z8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/69ahw5/the_taste_of_suboxone_strips/,t1_dh54m2l,Idk why it helps it may totaly be placebo but when i brush my teeth before dosing subs or zubsolv it always seems to disolve better and not have such a rancid taste. I dont mind the taste anymore but i still usualy brush before dosing just cause i feel it helps with absorbtion. Also you might be able to get by on 8mg a day take half in the morning and half in the evening and bank the rest im sure a million other people are gonna tell you too but 16mg is a high dose. Ive been as high as 32 and as low as 2mg maintaince wise my sweet spot is 4-6mg and i had a hefty habit at the end i was banging 10-20mg of fent throghout the day and sometimes opana and good bags when they were around.,PHattygrilledcheese,1493937498.0
dh6091b,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/69ahw5/the_taste_of_suboxone_strips/,t1_dh5d8xr,the drs wont want to lower the dose in my experience. if you get takeaways id just taper down myself. if you havent been takin them long then just rapidly taper down. start with as small a dose as you can and take more til you feel ok. best of luck and good job quitting fent ,reupj,1493993864.0

this may help

edit: http://imgur.com/a/xowvN

also...zubsolve is tablet (kind of like subutex i guess BUT....
zubsolv has the same exact chemical structure as Suboxone.     [Buprenorphine / Naloxone]
Suboxone is just a name brand.   Kind of like Xanax...is a name brand, but the actual drug is called alprazolam

Suboxone is like a Toyota where as Zubolv is like a Honda...same shit but they are each others competition.",chefffff,1494096246.0
