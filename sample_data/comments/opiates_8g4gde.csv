Then I stopped taking them because I was over the anxiety and the next day after skipping a night I was shaking and felt like my skin was crawling. I called the dr and told him and they told me I can't just stop those. I have to wean myself off. I was like thanks a lot fucking assholes. They should've told me that from the get go and I would've never started taking them.

But the benzo WD has been more low key, but really insidious. Like, I have a messed up sleep schedule but I’m sleeping. And while my memory and thinking are better, I still have big fuzzy areas. And every now and then I still have a hard time finding my words. 

I’m at the tail end of any benzo WD now, but it seems like it lingers awhile. Even with PAWS the opiate WD are more “wham, bam ....” y’know?

If you end up overlapping your quitting opiates and benzos, it can be really hard to tell which to blame for all the various symptoms especially once some time has passed. ",MetaMetaFour523,1525136892.0
