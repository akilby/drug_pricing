I suppose a kratom bender isn’t as objectively serious to your sobriety as an oxymorphone binge. I’m usually loathe and reticent to define “relapse” because it means different things to different people, but if it is/was then so what? 

None of us are perfect, mate & it doesn’t matter if you fall but that you get back up again. Dust yourself off, tomorrow is another day & you’ve got this. 4 months is good time and you deserve congratulations for that! 

That alone show you have the strength to get through. No one quite smoking for example their first time. Just learn from what precipitated this time, try and avoid it next time & move on. 

Good luck mate.

I don't consider kratom a full relapse myself. It's a harm reduction drug, like methadone or suboxone, if you've been truly addicted to opiates  ",extremelystupid77,1552298310.0
