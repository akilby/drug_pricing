I seem to have problems with most serotonin-affecting meds so that might have something to do with it? Never had any problems with E of course ;)

It pisses me off that I even had to take the tramadol in the first place. My normal doctor was on holiday and his stand-in decided that my many maladies no longer required my previous medication regimen. I tried to give it an honest shot and showed up back at his office 2 hrs after the appointment to get my arm and head stitched up from the fall. Haven't had to worry about Tramadol since.
