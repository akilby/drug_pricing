It is suggested to bring all medications in your carry on from the TSA website (I flew to colorado in May and had a similar question) in a clear plastic bag. They didn't even open the bag filled with prescription and OTC bottles.. 

I've read some horror stories of luggage being gone through and prescription medications being stolen. Theyre trying to move you along quickly, they don't really dig unless there is reason to.. so I'd suggest somewhere in your carryon or in a pill bottle like I did.",kittykins89,1419880543.0

Put the pill bottle in your carry-on. You won't have any problems with an amount that small. ,mistressmoxie,1419881681.0

I would prefer not to take the entire bottle with me but I'm wondering if it is safer just to bring the whole bottle with all of my prescription information on it just to avoid any hassle?,rubywidow80,1419886414.0

If you're going international I would just put it in the most harmless supplement bottle you can find because prescription bottles can easily be stolen as kitty said and some substances can't be brought in even if you have a script for it.
