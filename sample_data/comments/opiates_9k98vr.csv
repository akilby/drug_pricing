I’ve never shot or used heroin but my oxy habit got up to 180mg daily for months. I blew threw probably 10k and it still gets me down but what can i do? I understand that doesn’t hold a candle to other tolerances/habits on here but the kratom will be most effective when you’re in the deepest of withdrawals. It won’t be amazing, but it will make you feel a shit ton better. And the longer you stay off the traditional opiates, you’ll feel better each time. I took 7-8 grams and it had me feeling somewhat normal. I have a recipe for getting kratom down decently because I know it tastes like absolute tootyhole (not literally). 

One bottled water, empty two limes into a cup, some cayenne pepper (as much as you want), some sugar (again, add to taste), and your kratom. Mix it all together in the bottle of water and you can at least stomach it like that. If it’s still terrible just pinch your nose closed and chug it. That’s the only way I can do kratom that isn’t in caps now. Trust me on this. 

I wish you the best of luck. Don’t kick yourself, you’re human and we are all flawed from birth. Nobody is perfect so don’t let that get you down. As long as you are alive you still have a chance. Maybe tell your husband after you get through the worst of withdrawals and really stress that you need support rather than criticism. I’m lucky to have a girlfriend that is extremely supportive when I need it and it makes such a difference. Please don’t do anything permanent. Think of your beautiful daughter and use that as motivation to get better. I think of my baby boy and it helps me put things into perspective. You are loved and we are all here to support you!

Edit: something important to add that everyone needs to know when kicking, any mental problems you had that opiates seemed to help will still be there. Do not ignore them. Get help either from a therapist or psychiatrist. There’s no shame in it. I see a therapist once a week and it truly helps to see things clearly ",scritchthescratch,1538340258.0

I've probably used it to get off of dope 4 times now. (I'm not very good at staying off the dope for more than a few months, working on it!) Here's what to expect:

The first few days of dosing, kratom will barely work. But it will work! Your body is used to taking a much more powerful drug. Kratom will give you some relief from major withdrawal symptoms like shitting, runny nose, cold sweats and some minor mental relief for a few hours. You'll still feel like ass, but it won't be as bad as it would cold turkey. You may even catch a slight, slight, slight buzz (even with a habit as large as yours!) for like 20 minutes. But just hang in there! Your tolerance will drop rapidly. I find that the third day is where things start to look up. Kratom will start having more and more of an effect. It will eliminate withdrawal symptoms for hours. By day 5, you'll feel even better. I usually feel almost 100% by day 5, and kratom is back to its full potency. You'll be catching a good buzz from it. You'll want to drop the dosage around this time, so that you aren't doing too much and causing your tolerance to spike. After a week I'm totally normal. And you may think that quitting kratom will cause withdrawal, but it is NOTHING compared to any real opiate. I kicked kratom way easier than I kicked coffee.

As for dosage, my tolerance was fairly high this recent go-round, so I did 12.5 grams per dose. With the size of your habit I'm guessing that you will need more than that. Probably 20 grams. However, I'd be hesitant to take that much for your first time. Maybe try 10 grams, and if it has no effect after 15 minutes, drop another 10. I take one dose in the morning and one dose in the evening. It won't help you sleep for the first few days. I'd suggest bombing some melatonin and Aleve (lasts longer than ibuprofen) to help with sleep. You may get a few hours with all of that stuff combined. For preparation, I throw my dose in 1.5 cups of water with lemon juice and use a hand blender to mix it up. Then I chug it as fast I can. Good luck!

Either methadone or suboxone it helps a lot with not wanting to get high but hating being sober. It just gives you enough juice to get by in life imo. Then once your away from the using hard rugs for awhile you can taper off slowly. I mean you can technically do maintenance with Kratom but you’d have to taper your oxy use and get down to below 100mg to even have any effect. Also once you get stabilized on maintenance that’s he time to seek consoling, get a job, hobbies and friends. 

You can do this it’s never as bad as we make it out in our heads. I’ve been on almost exact position as you before multiple times. I’m sure many of us have but we make it through. It may not be easy but it’s 100% possible. So if I was you I’d try to use as little as possible for the next couple weeks. While tomorrow morning call around and find yourself a suboxone doctor.

Surround yourself with a strong support group wether that be AA or family and friends. Take up a new hobby like going to the gym, hiking, playing cards, whatever peaks your interest. The key is to resist, resist, resist the urge to pick up or use. This is probably the hardest part but the longer you go without using, the less frequent the mental cravings get.",EagleHunter4567,1538411319.0

To be fair, I was consuming 12 vegetable gelatin capsules of Kratom at a time to get 6 grams in. This happened on two occasiosn.


When I did mix it with OJ I encountered less stomach pain, first time I thought it was the acidity of the OJ... but I suspect that was still a better ROA than using the capsules.


Anyway, I've heard people discourage use of Kratom extracts but after getting stomach pains multiple times I think if I ever do Kratom again I'll seriously look into extracts. I mean like I've heard some people mix that with the leaf to add punch to it. The biggest concern I have is that extracts could boost my tolerance to the stuff but I figure it can't be any more riskier than Suboxone maintenance. ",sloan_fitch,1538419971.0
