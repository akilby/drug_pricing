What is the ratio for H and C when performing a speedball?

Never done coke...yet....so i don't know how much to sniff for a first time? And Im sure iving Is much stronger than sniffing so you would need much less.

Any advice on how to start wither coke? Soft.",Piscenian,1364492600.0

I would disagree because then coffee and codeine could be considered a ""speedball"". The feeling of even snorting both an upper and an opiate at the sametime does not touch the feeling of it IV'd. There really is no way to compare the experiences to say they are even close. Sorry, that excludes all those people that say they were speedballin on their adderall and vicodin.
