I'll quote within the intended context,
> ""I love you beautiful people. Never let society's misunderstandings get you down.""


It's true and the existence of this place has helped me by getting useful feedback and constructive criticism when applicable. I've seen variations on ""what could go wrong"" and what happens when you stay the course for too long. Also that the self-proclaimed hopeless are not always beyond hope.

Or at least before I got into heroin afterwards. It may sound weird to people but I try my best to stay away from opiates and former friends who are in and out of jail for their habits/scheming/stealing/ whatever has happened to them in real life. But opiates were a part of my life for so long that this sub lets me still talk about it without being judged. Whether it's about my own usage, my husband's recent relapse, or just answering someone else's question. This sub lets me scratch that itch of having opiates be in my life without actually needing to go out and get a gram to sniff. It's too risky for me to be around that shit in person right now, this sub is my outlet. ",SnikkiDoodle_31,1532370541.0

Some days we're Hunter S. Thompson. Some days we're that homeless dude in a gutter. It's the breaks. Like I emphasized, I just don't want anyone to ever feel bad about being where they're at cuz that does no one any good (2nd best time to plant a tree is today). If people want to be better, then they should take the slow steps needed to be better.

Good luck dude. If you ever want to try to shake off the monkey on your back you obviously have a bunch of people here who know you're the shit and will support you. If you want to keep up with the dope we'll appreciate you all the same. ",Serotogenesis,1532365612.0

I wasn't trying to die. Didn't even cross my mind until I hit the last .3 (the other two shots of .1 each were, say, 90% missed) and then I realized exactly how big of a mistake I made.

I honestly hated 90% of the experience... Not my thing.
