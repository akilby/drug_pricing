dy5w0tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8frhfn/using_subs_to_detox_from_hydros/,t3_8frhfn,"I may be of some help here, at one time years ago I was getting 500 count bottles of hydros every month and eating them like candy. One time I was particularly dry and came across a person who gave me 12 sub strips and I decided to try and kick with them. They were not what I was expecting even cutting them up
Into tiny strips they would make me nod out hard with very little rush/euphoria. Have you tried to kick or take a break on your own? It’s uncomfortable and yeah it kinda sucks but it’s not too tough if you’ve got the willpower, I found it to be 80% psychological. 

Taking subs to kick a hydro habit isn’t a good idea IME, it was like using a baseball bat as a fly swatter. I’d highly advise trying a different method. The best thing that worked for me was kratom and adderall. This combo 100% quelled the physical WD’s and kept me peppy brought to work and function during the day. At night I take some clonidine and/or hydroxyzine and gabas to help the anxiety. I know this is quite a list and if you can’t get ahold of all of it there’s plenty of OTC substitutes. Even caffeine pills and melatonin with alieve and kava kava would suffice. The physical wd’s from a heavy hydro habit (and I mean like 70mgs/day) was unpleasant but not impossible at all.

If you try the subs you’ll find yourself really feeling like a junky and it won’t really help your situation. At least I did, lots of lethargy and no rush. Kratom REALLY helps! I promise, at least it does for me. Just don’t find yourself kicking those pills and crawl back to oxy like I did a year later. You got this man, toss the sub. You don’t need it",CatharsisOfDisorder,1525012683.0

And that was when I was on a roughly,300-400mg a day Oxy habit, so I’m assuming it would kick the ish outta your hydro habit..

Not talking shit at all, I know any kind of addiction to any type of opiate is a bitch, and scary to think about quitting-but the Kratom (if it’s good) will be a life saver..

I’m not exactly sure on the dosage I was taking, it was couple yrs back, but I have my whole “De-toxing from this hell-ish drug” formula saved somewhere on my computer, I’ll take a look and PM If I can find it. But ya, it was basically take a shit ton of Kratom, smoke(or eat) a good amt of herb and binge on some shows. And if you can find the “K-shots” even better!! It’s a kratom concentrate in liquid form, not cheap, but worth every penny!!! 

Once again, I’m But one man. But I’ve tried both, and muuuch much more prefer the Kratom route! Good luck to ya, my friend!! ",nunyabiz22,1525014744.0
