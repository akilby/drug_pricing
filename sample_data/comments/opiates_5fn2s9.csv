Why did you start getting seizures? I sometimes use up to 800+mg and have never gotten a seizure but I'm more or less more careful with my dosages now, tolerance is stressful.",Mountain_Ent,1480491095.0

Imma start introducing mexican street slang to my bropies so anyone wanting to learn, Imma be the r/opiates resident ling√ºistic/musician/full time substance enthusiast.

Any doubts about the game in Mexico, prices vary from zone to zone (no DOx please). You can always pm. 

If any of you want to kick it out in mexico, I gots all the hookups, for about 400 dollars we can go to the beach with all inclusive booze and grub. Stay there for a week floatin high in the ocean.",Mountain_Ent,1480528019.0

Could have interacted with my Paxil, but I mean I the two together for about a year and then randomly had a seizure. Looked up on my moms couch to see people standing over me and then the same thing happened a few days later and I went to the ER. Definitely be careful. 
 
Edit to say - was the Paxil that I joined in a a year ago. Have been on tram for almost 7 years ",chasing-d0pamine,1480504324.0

I have chronic back pain due to a scoliosis and several pinched nerves in my lumbar and upper back, the most I can get is Ibuprophen or trams which suck in the long run.

Pain management doctors here only prescribe opiates (buprenorphine, codeine and tramadol) besides the benzos they give like candy if you got a script (30x 2mg kpins for 2 dollars) but this is usually for people in their deathbeds, cousin broke 15 bones last february, all meds where nSAIDs, no real pain management, for a 5 foot 80 pound girl, who just fell !27 FUCKING feet! Into concrete, but no, lets not give her morphine till later on.

Sorry for the rant, really pissed my back problems can only be treated with opies because nothing else helps, except insane amounts of weed. Don't wanna be always looking for the next score, but I sure as SHIT ain't livin sober with this back pain.

tl;dr Only realistic pain management option for me is either tram abuse, coppin from the most unreliable plugs, or go straight back to see who got the boy. Sorry bibly slater haha, something to pass time while reading.",Mountain_Ent,1480527425.0
dam9lp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5fn2s9/trams_and_trees/,t1_dalw8od,"Oooh that makes sense, I had a near death experience with paxil, drank a bit too much, potentiated whatever suicieal thoughts my teenager mind had whipped up, and felt the need to drink myself unconsious. 

It was proven later that the pharma company that manufactures paxil got charged with a billion dollar lawsuit, they hid information from clinical trials which support the fact that Paxil INCREASES suicidal tendencies and depression levels on people under 21.

Took it for almost a year when I decided, to hell with it going cold turkey.

Paroxetine smh...

damc2jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5fn2s9/trams_and_trees/,t1_damaltu,"Paxil does not do well with many substances, idk if the enzyme in whitegrapefruit juice would interact, i know it potentiates liver enzyme CYPD6 and benadryl helps drowsiness amd itching along with opiate potentitor.

Just, be really careful on ssris, I hope they're trully helping you.

CT was bad, droopy and always sleepy, suicidadal multiple times a day, what got me through was being focused on somethimg, school, home proyects, shit hustlin counts too. By the end of the first week/second week you will be a right.

But I'd recommend a slow taper, I'll pm you dosages if you wish, or you could also talk about it to your Rx and see what he decides, but this should be last choice because most doctors what you to finish treatments which really worth it, but well cash rules everything around me.
