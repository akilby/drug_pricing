Oxycodone keeps me awake sometimes. I’ll lay down to go to sleep and it’s just not happening. Opioids can be can be very stimulating.,Randomuser12345666,1550420163.0
ego4cq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/arlvgc/wtf_is_up_with_dilaudid/,t3_arlvgc,"Hmmm this seems weird to me. 

Before I was switched to oxy. I was prescribed heavy amounts of dilaudid. 

Starting with 200 x 2mg per month, then on to 200 x 4mg per month, and eventually 150 x 8mg per month. 

Never experienced any weird side effects, and dilaudid seemed to be one of the most sedating painkillers for me. It really helped me sleep because It made me much more relaxed and tired, especially than my current oxy script does, and seemed to work better for certain pain as well. When I look back now I think I’d rather have stayed on it over oxy, but I’m not one to complain. 


Edit: are you sure your pills were authentic? This sounds to me like some of the shitty fentalogues that are being pressed into pills these days. ",NoddGod,1550422368.0

But dilly has always disappointed me. Even back a few years ago when I first started IVing things (no longer do, btw) and my tolerance was way low, all Dilly's ever did for me was a rush, a pleasant almost painful senssation behind my shoulder blades, then.... Nothing. Just wasn't sick anymore for a few more hours. 
That's what led me to heroin, the pills were so expensive but the Chiva was so cheap...and got me higher. ",TheRoomsRbugged,1550427317.0

egocmzv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/arlvgc/wtf_is_up_with_dilaudid/,t3_arlvgc,"I also get weird side affects from dills, but positive ones. 

I have type 1diabetes. I only got a few years ago after a sever accident. Most people don't believe that but i had no family history, eat decent, and had a very physical job, so i stayed in shape. 

As most people know type 1 is different than type 2, because it means your body is just done creating insulin. For some reason when i take dills i don't need insulin. My blood sugar stays under 150. And i check often. 

I wish u could bring this up to my endrocrinologist but her, my GP, and my ortho are all at the same hospital. Meaning when she enters notes in they all see it. I did not heal well after the accident, a lot having to do with getting diabetes soon after the it. It's pretty much a certainty that i will re injure or at least need work in the future, so I'm really trying to avoid that red flag in my chart. ",EskomojoE,1550428920.0

Maybe it was a one time bad reaction, which I hope it is, but if I were you I’d still get some fent test strips. 

being an army vet doesn’t exclude anyone from receiving fake pills. It’s well known that tons of people with scripts will use their own medication and then buy fakes to sell, knowing that people will trust them because they have a script. ",NoddGod,1550423522.0

He's a type 1 diabetic, 84 years old and for the past 50 years, if you only checked his a1c, you'd think ""that's not a diabetic."" He believes, as do I, that diabetics have the right to normal blood sugars - the reason being that blood sugars between 70 and 100 prevent diabetic complications.

Part of his secret is an extremely consistent, Atkins-style diet (<30g carb/day (6 breakfast, 12 luncheon, 12 dinner, reduce to fit) excluding liquid glucose for hypo correction, 1.4-2.8g protein per kilo of ideal body mass, fat as required)

Getting your bgs levelled out and down to 83mg/dL will make quitting opies easier too if you want to.",j4jackj,1550544780.0
