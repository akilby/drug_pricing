The same is true with the super gooey tar. Bth is greatly affected by outside conditions like weather and how it's been transported. The consistency can't tell u much about it's quality, u just gotta try it and see for urself.  A trick for snorters that hate monkey water but have gooey product; melt it on foil, don't heat enuff 2 make it smoke, just melt. When it cools, it'll be a glassy, hard substance, let it cool all the way and then u can smash it into a fine powder. ",DopeDunDaily,1518596767.0
du801mm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7xfslg/question_about_bth/,t3_7xfslg,My tar is usually rock hard almost looks like a rock of obsidian sometimes. Occasionally Iâ€™ll get gunpowder which is more powdery and always fire. Iâ€™ve gotten gooey ass tar before and itâ€™s a pain in the ass but some people tell me the goopiest the better which I think isnâ€™t true. ,sacballkings,1518587249.0

I get it from my dude who has ounces of the huff, it goes straight from the dark brown powder to hard black tar, you could chip it. The softer it is, the more cut.",kinglouie760,1518586278.0

du854on,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7xfslg/question_about_bth/,t1_du84xnz,I didnâ€™t actually say that harder tar was stronger in my post. I said that in a comment because of info someone else provided. I really have no idea how to determine the strength of h other than testing it yourself. Idk if it being harder has any effect because Iâ€™ve bought from the same source throughout my entire time using ,AgingHippieLiberal,1518597230.0
