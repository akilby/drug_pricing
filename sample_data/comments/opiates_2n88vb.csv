Currently cold turkey from another relapse, went 3 months, using oxy, stablon (insane amounts) at the same time. I was back up to half a gram of oxy per day.

cmbcz0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2n88vb/took_the_week_off_to_go_cold_turkey/,t1_cmbaj8l,"No problem man, its a combination of ""the thomas recipe"" which you should look up and what makes me personally comfortable. To start you should try to procure a supply of comfort med's to help you through the worst of it (1-4 or 5 days usually but dependent on the half life of whatever your taking) 

OTC Meds: Immodium, Ibuprofen, Valarian root, Benadryl, General Multivitamin(optional)

Prescription meds: Some type of benzo either Valium or Xanax what i use but use whatever you have/can get
-Muscle relaxer Soma or Flexeril or whatever other muscle relaxer you have the Valium can also double as a muscle relaxer, 
-Clonidine this one you probably wont be able to find on the street and will need a doctor to write it for you, 
-Neurontin aka Gabapentin I have not used this for withdrawal at all yet but a lot of people have said it works and i have some so im going to try it out when i have to kick again in a few weeks
-There is def some more but I can't think of off my head, ill either edit them in later or PM you


Go shopping and get foods that are nutritious and easy to make obviously food choices are subjective person to person so i will just list what I like. It will probably be different for you but the rule of thumb should be HEALTHY and NUTRITIOUS foods, You need to give your body the tools it needs to repair the damage you have done. I am guilty of having a horrible diet while using (like right now lol), but you will be surprised at how much better you feel just from eating a little better even just like one good salad a day. You did good with the soups, but also maybe get some of those pre-made salads, Vegetables like carrots broccoli whatever your like, maybe some steak and grilled chicken PROTEIN, yogurt, oatmeal, granola bars, cereal maybe? Buy some different fruit to graze on, Apples, Oranges, whatever you like (PineApple I love). What you have pictured already is totally fine but defiantly try and mix in some of whats listed or whatever YOU like that's healthy and nutritious, Lots of water and Gatorade which i see your already on top of. Remember you NEED to give your body the tools to repair itself. EAT WELL.",chippersan,1416807240.0
cmbdlx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2n88vb/took_the_week_off_to_go_cold_turkey/,t1_cmbcz0c,"My plan for kicking is usually pretty simple which is perfect that you took the week off and have no work to do. Take the benzos the first night to knock yourself out and get some sleep, when you wake up in the morning make sure you get a little food in you and drink lots of fluids the first day, the more fluids you drink the sooner you will flush out your system and the detox will be over. I don't know if you smoke pot or if you think that will help but i know it helps me esp. if your in a state where you can get edibles thats even better, to just get high as shit and play xbox or watch movies or find something to do to keep yourself busy. 

Take the benzo's only at night for sleep and only for the first 3-4 days TOPS, you don't want to risk having rebound anxiety/insomnia from the benzos because then have a whole other problem. If you feel good enough to do anything active the first day even just going for a short walk is good to stimulate and tire yourself out a bit because day 2-3-4 are usually the worst and you wont want to do anything. The rest of the kick should go like this, Take the Benzo only at night to sleep, Drink lots of fluids, use the muscle relaxer for RLS as needed (use common sense and don't mix muscle relaxers while on the benzo and be careful about Respiratory Depression). Smoking pot during the day can help alleviate some of the withdrawal symptoms and take your mind off it. Hot showers or if you know a place with a sauna/steam room are great for sweating out all the shit in your body and can really make you feel a million times better almost high even afterwords (for me at least lol). Obviously use the OTC meds as needed for whatever your feeling.

Once your past day 4 you should be through the worst of it, so don't give up now. As you keep going you'll feel noticeably better every day as you wake up and it really is an amazing feeling. Also as soon as you feel up to it exercising can really help repair the parts of your brain that you damaged during your addiction, it will stimulate the reward systems and get your endorphins going, ever hear of  ""runners high""? there are a lot of supplements you can take to encourage your brain to produce those chemicals naturally again.

The Clonidine which you'll need to get from the Doctor is a blood pressure med thats used to lower blood pressure during acute withdrawal but can also help with the sweating and chills but it will also make you a little drowsy so be aware.
