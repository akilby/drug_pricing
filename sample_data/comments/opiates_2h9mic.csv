I couldn't even afford my habit here I guess, so probably be best to not even think about it - but damn this can be an obsessive thing. ",bll78,1411507378.0

ckrgtwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h9mic/geography/,t1_ckqrhgu,"I've been doing it so long now. It get's old. I probably would have stayed. I had a decent life and a good business. By American standards not making a ton, about $70,000 to $80,000 a year US - but most people in Indian cities make about $5000-$8000ish a year, so I relatively speaking I was in great shape financially and could continue to support my habit. When my gramma died though and I was not able to come back because I knew I'd be too sick to attend her funeral anyway I decided to leave and it made me realize a few things about myself. 
I have an engineering degree from a top school. I was involved with a few start ups and people who got them going in Silicon Valley when I got out of college, which I was able to leverage in India - but could have done so much more here. I have friends who are worth over $100million, who have families, who have businesses they enjoy and friends that don't steal from them. 
I have scars all over my arms and terrible nerve pain in my hip from an infection and wake up in the middle of the night dreaming about dope - all because of the choices I made. 
If I could go back and do it again I can't say I would change anything because I think we live the life we are supposed to live - but I can say that I hope that part of my life is over, and I can move onto something else. What that is? No clue.  ",bll78,1411585248.0

ckrgmms,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h9mic/geography/,t1_ckqp7ma,"easy to get. I'd just sort of chipped and fucked around with stuff through college like anyone else. I finished college in 1998, so heroin and opiates were not really the big thing they are now - but I'd screwed around and liked them. When I got to India it did not take long for it to get out of hand. ",bll78,1411584880.0
ckqnrdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h9mic/geography/,t1_ckqnlsp,"It was supportable in India. I'd chipped for a long time and then 8 years ago went to India. I liked the place. I'm a good programmer and manager, so I was able to start a company there and make a nice living by Indian standards. 

My gramma is the closest person in the world to me though, and when she died I was not able to come back for her funeral. So, I'm trying to stop. I came back to Iowa to  make it harder to get dope/easier to stop. 

If I had the same habit here as I did in India I'd be spending $300/$400 a day on heroin and i don't have that kind of money. (it's about $50 for a bundle here) ",bll78,1411508536.0

ckrfypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2h9mic/geography/,t1_ckqwoca,"There is a decent scene in Waterloo, Iowa City, Cedar Rapids, or at least there was a few years ago. The cops have been busting a lot of people there for it recently. I've heard there also is in Dubuque and the Quad Cities, but I've never been there to get it myself. People bringing stuff from Chicago, St Louis and a few bringing it up from Texas. Where I'm at now it's very hard to find anything aside from a Norco or Percocet and really bad quality heroin. You can get dilaudid, but they will run about $30/$40 for an 8mg - and those don't do much for me. When I first got back I bought a few of them to help me through, but in terms of getting high I did 4 of them and was still having half a panic attack from withdrawal.  Like I said though, I basically trying to get clean, so I guess it's not an all bad thing. There is a methadone clinic in Des Moines, but it seems like it's mostly pills there. 
Also - I fucked up on the price of a bundle - one single bag was $30-$50 a few years ago, a bundle would run you about $250. It might be a little less now - or a little more, who knows. ",bll78,1411583665.0
