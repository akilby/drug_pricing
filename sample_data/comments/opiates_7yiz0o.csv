..You get dumped by your BF of 10 years...nope no crying...Some reason you can't get your methadone and go into withdrawal... yep that will make you cry.

I remember the first time I W/D, I didn't even know what W/D was and I WAS SO DEPRESSED. I just wanted to kill myself because Nothing made me happy or wanted to live, not even another perc like I just wanted to die plain and simple.
Id be fine and then literally out of no where start balling my eyes out like a little girl. Plus being alone is the WORST while withdrawaling, just remember this is only temporary, it will not be forever, try to get your hand on some benzos if you can but I'd get weed but I'm just not a huge fan of xans and all that, I hope you feel better, do whatever you can to distract yourself.

Like someone said, just know it’s only temporary and it, dare I say,

Could always be worse.  Like going through this WD process, in a holding tank, freezing your ass off curled in a ball on the cement floor covered in bum jizz and piss. Could always be worse man",Lvrry,1519007242.0

I'd say it's just a regular old WDs.. but I don't know what to tell you man. All I do when I'm withdrawing is laying in bed tossing and turning and chain smoke cigarettes. Shit sucks a big one. And please don't slit your wrists bro, you got people that care about you your mom just to list one. That's not going to solve anything. If you're going to kill yourself why not just go rob a liquor store or something and go buy some dope? LOL not that I'm saying you should do that... hang in there man I know each hour feels like a day. Just have to try to distract yourself as best as possible",supremefiend91,1519003196.0

Wenn du überhaupt nicht mehr weiter weisst ruf nen Krankenwagen. Die bringen dich dann wohin (vermutlich Psychiatrie mit Entzugsabteilung) wo dir geholfen wird. 

Du lebst doch in Deutschland oder ? Hast du einen Schulabschluss/ Ausbildung,/ Job?

Hab dir schonmal geantwortet, du hattest leider nicht geantwortet. Ich kann mir das kaum anschauen wie ein junger Mann (18 oder so glaub ich?!) sein Leben wegwirft... Mach doch was daraus!
