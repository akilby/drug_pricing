I actually legitimately NEED these meds in order to function. I have kids, I have a job, etc and I won’t be able to deal with any of that stuff if I am in 9/10 pain all day long. Withdrawal doesn’t scare me at all... it’s the pain that scares me. Pisses me off too because my life is SO much better since getting on opioids. It’s been like 10 years on them but getting symptoms under control was life changing... I was just a depressed puddle of pain that did nothing but writhe around in bed before I found a doctor willing to prescribe what I needed. I had no job, I was in the verge of losing my kids because I couldn’t take care of them... opioids turned things around and gave me my life back.

It’s actually not even far it’s just that I have to pay out of pocket because he’s not covered by my insurance.
