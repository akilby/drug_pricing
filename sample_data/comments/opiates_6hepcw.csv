The mods, the users, those who are just curious, those in recovery, the pain patients, those who are hopelessly addicted. 

Our community is beautiful, considering the content of what it is. This sub is something for everyone. It is death and destruction. It is a huge harm reduction site. It is recovery. It is relapse. It is maintenance. It is hope. It is diverse, and yet all of us from different walks of life and in different relationships with opiates come together. We save lives. We reduce harm. We help people get clean. We share our tales and keep it real, despite some people treating those stories like we are animals on display at the zoo. 

We are playing with fire, many of us. But we do the best we can. This community is the strongest one I've ever seen and it amazes me so much. I have connected with so many amazing people here both on and off the sub. I've argued with assholes. I've tried to save people posting careless things and flirting with death. I've sympathized with those in a similar boat I am. I've tried to help people get clean. I try to brace myself for the inevitable losses we will have here. I've been talked off the ledge by quite a few people here. And some have truly held me down and saved me from myself many times. This community comes together for everything - for awesome dope porn, advice, deterrence for those circling the rabbit hole. And especially lately I've noticed, for those off-topic posts where people just need love.

It seems like you guys have kind of split up the tasks to compartmentalize things a bit.  Id be interested to hear what each mod's role is....,viledenial,1497658857.0

diy5xzk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6hepcw/ro_luvvvvv_in/,t1_diy4l1y,You sound like the most sad and pathetic little bitch. Didn't your parents ever teach you that if you have nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all? Or did they also see that you are a rude and whiny little bitch and not waste their time? I was taught that and have respect for others and so does Spin. I'm only lashing out because what you've said is completely out of line and you need to be put in check.,PYITE315,1497549788.0

But Fash is the only one with CSS knowledge and does the design and programming. Otherwise we all do the same stuff. We try to coordinate our schedules a bit, so there is someone on at all times, but of course there are times when that just isnt possible. Our roles are generally reading all the posts, removing content that isnt allowed, answering modmails for folks that have question's or need help, occasionally we talk to reporter's or researcher's or people in the harm reduction field. Fash does a great job on the programming side of it. Tracey and Fash also send out care packages. That's the majority of what we do I think. ",spinderella69,1497660032.0
