How you feeling, how long ago did this happen? I assume you were on the Lope to help with withdrawal? Hope you feel better, bud and sorry that happened to you.",JustGlassin89,1532025504.0

e2p1xia,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9083om/stroke_from_lope/,t1_e2owf73,Even 50mg isn't really a low dose. Anything about 40 or so is just not worth it at all. Glad you are okay though bro and sorry that that shit happened to you. I can understand wanting to be well.,harea123,1532043696.0
e2phnis,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9083om/stroke_from_lope/,t1_e2owf73,Dude 50mg is a lot man. Like no wonder you had a stroke if your taking over 100mg a day...lope is dangerous to do that much especially everyday for long terms. I don’t think your suppose to use it for more than 2 weeks at a time and that’s taking like 8mg a day(4mg in the morning and 4mg at night). Lope can kinda help with WD but not really just tough out 5 days and use bars stop the lope.,Drmtndew,1532060967.0
