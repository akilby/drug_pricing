Just don't overdue it, mixing uppers and downers will increase the your risk of overdosing.

dnphlvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/73ddo3/slow_breathing/,t1_dnphgb1,If it's been a decent amount of time since you dosed your fine. Judging by when this post was made it was a little while ago so by now you're good. But if the shallow breathing is bothering you. You can take a small dose of a stimulant. But don't do a lot as it would just do more harm than good. Stims are bronchodilators so they will help your breathing. ,Psychonaut424,1506752574.0

I'm just saying that what you said didn't really correlate to what he said. And harm reduction would have been telling him exactly what I said. By answering his question. ,Psychonaut424,1506752467.0
