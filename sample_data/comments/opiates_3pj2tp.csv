When you take it a few times in a row the half life will be towards the upper end. Half life isn't a steadfast indicator for when something will be completely out of your system, there are too many variables.",KickerS12X,1445368132.0

My google results are coming up with listings saying 1-2 days while others are saying 3-5 and there's no chance of it being out before 3... yet I see some posts that say maximum 48 hours. Why is there so much conflicting data? I mean I understand factors like metabolism and hydration can cause variations but why such a large difference in average data?",injectintoeyeball,1445372514.0

That isn't necessarily when all of the metabolites clear your system, that is how long a substance takes to lose half of it's pharmacological activity. If you have taken oxycodone chronically and you have a fast metabolism, I would bet it would be there for a test a little over 48 hours later. It is so hard to say for sure though.",KickerS12X,1445372771.0
