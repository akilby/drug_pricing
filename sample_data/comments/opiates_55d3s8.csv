I'm sure we all watch these prison shows on occasion. Some themes become clear. You want to talk about profiling......young, men. Yes, women do criminal shit too but my point is, when they go back and interview someone years later, big difference between a 20 year old, and a 50 year old. Huge. Maybe there's some testosterone thing to it but people tend to chill out as they get older. It's obvious, but fact is, we change.",HarpuaUnbound,1475327653.0
d89nqsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/55d3s8/boring_bupe/,t3_55d3s8,Kinda sounds like you're ready to be done. Maybe find some new hobbies so you aren't bored and continue the subs? I've been clean for 3 years but I know several people who have overdosed because of the same thing. This is a huge part of why I'm done. You just can't trust anything out there anymore and it's gotten pretty scary from what I can tell. Also hope your team plays well today! College football is huge in my state as well!

I quit talking to basically everybody, I know if I kept in closer contact I would fuck up, and I've been sober longer than I have the past 3ish years. I had a feeling things were going to get scary out there, I'm glad I bailed when I did, as badly as I miss everyone.

I'm a homo, which means if I ever want a family adoption is one of the most viable options obvi, and I def don't need to pick up a record, much less for hardcore narcotics, if I ever wanna be able to get past an adoption application 

I also am not so concerned with what people think of me so my anxieties have morphed and changed more inwardly so social situations aren't as difficult anymore as when I was younger (in the south in the closet- scary when I was a teenager) so that also helps 

I just need to get clean man. It's time, I've used all my luck, all my close calls. No more... I gotta finally start focusing on my future and flying instead of just mildly succeeding at living ",Southern_psychonaut,1475328518.0

And I feeeeeeeel you on the games!!!!!!! Ours starts at 6, so many good games today but they all are so late and at the same time! I may have to go to Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere with tons of tvs lol.

But yeah. Boom. And all I can say is that I look back, and I have some regrets. There are things I would change. We all will have them, and yeah, it is what it is, you learn from it all, definitely. But I would say, run with this. You're in the right head right now, and you're growing up. Even drinking.

I'm sure they sell H in my town but I've never seen any of it and everybody I know that's on it goes to New Orleans to cop. I guess it's kind of good because it restricts me to the point that I don't have easy access, but it's also a bummer when I'm fiending because I have to pull major fuckin strings.",gingerbreaddd,1475349322.0

And ya, recently I've been staying sober a lot more, minus the bupe.

Not to mention getting away from all the felons and wanna-be fatal-OD'ers, and future felons... no time for that

I find that it allows me, when I have a craving, to just say ""yeah, just do your job bupe"", and then the added ""and, it wouldn't work if I wanted to go get high anyway"".
