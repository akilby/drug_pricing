dw7of6e,https://i.redd.it/bdyftv5zujn01.jpg,t3_86mjjt,"Curious, if you were going to use the pods for â€˜imbibing,â€™ would a few good sized pods dried out and then prepared as one does be enough you think? For someone with a lowish~ tolerance? People mostly knock growing your own poppies but I wonder if your not planning on trying to make opium from them if the pods would be worth it for their effects alone? It obviously wouldnâ€™t be a large yield in most cases, but I would think it would be relatively low maintenance and a better yield than extracting opium from them right? ",AbanoR,1521903092.0

dw6o53s,https://i.redd.it/bdyftv5zujn01.jpg,t1_dw6my5v,"It's not worth doing inside, simply because the yield per plant is absolutely horrible compared to say cannabis. In addition, it's pseudo 99% legal to grow them in the US as long as they are NEVER scored, there isn't acres and acres of growing them, and you're not selling them or something. If you're dumb enough to express to LEO that they're not for ornamental purposes, then yeah you're going to jail. 

People don't realize that opium is only ~10% morphine by dried weight, and that percentage only goes up to maybe 20-25% max if you use very obscure GMO big Pharma seeds. Even then it means that you might not even get an entire gram per plant, which is only like 100mg Oxyc max equivalent if you eat it orally. So yeah, indoor growing isn't worth the energy bill and you'll be fucked on any excuse for ornamental use if there's 30 hydroponic poppy plants in your basement and no other plants.

There's a reason that dope isn't made domestically, and it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with how illegal it is. The reality is it takes dozens and dozens of plants to produce any significant amount of opium/dope unless you're utilizing every inch of the plant, in which case it's not pure morphine in the slightest and all the other alkaloids are potentially poisonous and at the very least produce inferior highs.

Basically dope is only reasonably priced because it's made by farmers in some of THE poorest countries on Earth, such as Myanmar, northern Thailand, Laos, Afghanistan, and to some extent Columbia. Instead of a gram of mediocre opium, an illicit farmer can grow a cannabis plant and get 1-4+ ounces easily per plant depending, or over a pound or more for outdoor plants.",DrMarioBrother,1521843886.0
dw80js2,https://i.redd.it/bdyftv5zujn01.jpg,t1_dw7of6e,There are two ways that people do it. Some just dry the pods out and use them but I'm fairly sure you lose more of the alkaloids this way but it is safer because you aren't leaving your poppies in the middle of the field dripping opium for everyone to see. The old school tried and true way is to score them. There is a reason it's still done to this day. I'm pretty sure the pharmaceutical companies use equipment to extract the alkaloids but we don't have access to such things. If you have some land it is possible to do enough to support your own habit.,TheOpiumWars,1521916916.0
