We started out with 1 -2 pods, which was a good dose for a low tolerance.  For higher tolerance, you can get up to 6 - 8 pods and beyond in one dose.

My roommate became addicted to the tea, and every morning I'd wake to the sound of him grinding pods for his morning brew.  I could never seriously get addicted to it, simply because the taste is so god awful that it became harder to drink each time, ugh if I could remember what it smelled like I would gag.

To make the tea, you need a [coffee grinder](https://www.google.com/search?q=coffee+grinder&rlz=1C1TSND_enUS411US411&oq=coffee+grinder&aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62.4202j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), a ceramic bowl or something microwave safe, and some cloth you don't mind throwing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  away, like a cheap pack of under shirts you don't mind cutting into squares.

Break open each pod after you determine how many you need, dump out the poppy seeds.  Keep them or throw them away, it's up to you if you want to try the weaker poppy seed tea down the road. Put pieces of the pod shell into the grinder, and grind it into a powder.  Repeat until all of your pods are powder, seeds removed before grinding.  Mix water in with the powder in a microwaveable container, cook until boiling or slightly under boiling.  Try not to use too much water, because you're gonna have to drink however much you use.  After the terrible smelling mix has been cooked, throw in some ice cubes to speed cooling, because you can burn yourself on this next step if you are too impatient.  Take a pint glass, cut out a ten inch square from the pack of undershirts you bought, and hold the cloth around the top of the pint glass like you are making a drum, but the cloth is simply a filter.  Pour the bowl of warm poppy slop onto the cloth/into the pint glass, then wrap the cloth around the slop, twist it and squeeze to get all the nasty poppy pod juice out and into your pint glass.

You should now have a murky, warm, stinking few ounces of the grossest beverage you will ever consume.  Some people try to make it in more of a tea fashion, using honey or lemons or who knows what to help mask that pungent taste.  But to be honest, there's no masking it.  I try to use as little liquid as possible in my preparation.  I get it cold before I drink it, and then I take it like a shot with a chaser of lime juice or something.  One time, since I hate the taste so much, I got it ready down to the final ounce, ready for ingestion, and I poured the shot onto a baking pan, so that it would thinly spread out for drying.  Once dry enough, I scraped the baking pan of the resin-like evaporated goo, which was rolled up into a resin-ball, about the size of a marble, and taken like a pill.  It was a ton of work and waiting, not really worth it to skip having to taste it, but the resiny poppy-goo ball.",Kevinsense,1371156394.0

They take sooo long for any meaningful amount of liquid to pass through, and it's far too easy to grow impatient and try to give it a little squeeze to speed it through, then all of a sudden it tears and all that shit drops into your glass.  Don't use coffee filters, cloth works 100x better.",Kevinsense,1372051826.0

I just hate when people don't do any research of their own and then act like they found something totally new. But yeah, a little snarky sarcasm isn't too bad.  It's not like you directly insulted the OP.",srfans,1371222304.0
