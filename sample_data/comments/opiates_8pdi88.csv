you never have any similar issues with oxy at all that you noticed? i assume not, as you don't seem scared off using them as well, but that's just so odd you'd react so extremely to methadone and be fine with oxy. different drugs for sure, but i always just thought people would respond similarly to all full agonists.

good luck to you, i hope you're able to find a situation that works out more long term for you and keeps you well and healthy and safe.",filonome,1528402139.0

e0amdvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8pdi88/done_with_methadone_bad_experience/,t3_8pdi88,"Dude if you react like that from methadone, you have no business taking, it you do not have a tolerance for it. I am not offending you either! It is very dangerous, methadone is only for people with large snorting habits and IV habits of heroin... Oxy addiction can be suppressed by suboxone bro. Back when I snorted 6 blues a day half a sub had me fucked up.  When I started IVing around 2 grams a day 24mg would not touch it. 

I am now on methadone going up slowly to a target dose of 160mg. This is for a large fentdope IV habit not OXY. Methadone is overkill for light to moderate oxycodone addictions.  Methadone would only be warranted for extremely high doses oxycodone (ie: 200mg and up) or oxymorphone or diladuid addictions. Commonly used for moderate to severe heroin users.  Oxycodone I promise can be dealt with usually with no more than 8mg of bupenorphine.",chrislantern,1528410578.0
