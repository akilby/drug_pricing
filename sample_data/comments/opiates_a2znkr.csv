I don't know why but I can't stop laughing at this sentence. I know what you're trying too say but all I can think is "".. you mean, sobriety?"" lol.

Also ya that's weird that you consult your pupils as a deciding factor in whether or not to dose.",new_name_who_dis,1543932113.0

Total new one, 🌟lito, my friend, just when I thought I'd heard it all.

You know what I mean? Or do you consider the time that the high has worn off through the time your sick sober time? To me sober time starts 24hr after last dose,starlitobaby615,1543992178.0

But usually if I’m not sick feelings and my pupils are still pinned as shit I figure it’s too early. I’m turning 30 in 9 months so I’m trying to become more responsible with my use and only use when in pain. It’s weird my eyes help decide this haha",starlitobaby615,1543991837.0
eb4he2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a2znkr/pinned/,t1_eb2kccu,"Na it’s when I’m not sick and my pupils are still pinned that I think “we’ll maybe it’s too soon”... I try to only use 2-3 times max a day and don’t want too use too much so I’m tying to figure out perfect timing.. as odd as it is how pinned my eyes are has been a large determining factor in when to dose.. when they start to become unpinned and more regular and my skin begins to get a tad temp change around 11-13hr in, I know I’ve waited far long enough can do a biggg bump. And the difference in relief after waiting 10-13hr and waiting 2-3 is insane. People would probably only use twice a day if they knew they could get that rush every time they was high with less use ",starlitobaby615,1543992061.0
eb4hn7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/a2znkr/pinned/,t1_eb4hh2a,"And yes it’s a SUPER WEIRD way of deciding if I should dose... for some reason it helps a lot.. I typically do a quarter gram upon waking up and if I dose too soon (anytime before 7/8hr after my first dose) I barely feel higher and just waste dope basically... but if I’m able to wait to 9/10hr I actually get a good high and if I can wait 11-13hr I get just as high as that first big line. For some reason my pupil size helps my determine how high I am around hour 8/9, when that next fat line is in mind, so I don’t use too soon or go through any unneeded suffering.

Lol; yes my eyes help guide me ",starlitobaby615,1543992414.0
