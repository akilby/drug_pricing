It’s not going to help probably only make things worse. Normally for one to get clean they either hit rock bottom or get tired of the constant fight. My suggestion to you would be to try subs or possibly the vivitrol (sp) shot if you have insurance. ,cert1f13dthr0waway,1526261402.0

A room full of people who have gone through the exact same shit. Even if you dont want to stop you'll find someone to talk to. Just a suggestion. Google meeting spots if you're interested in. ,Premium_Orgasm,1526261899.0
