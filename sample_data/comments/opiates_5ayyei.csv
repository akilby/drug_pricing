The change of pressure probably makes the last tiny drop in the syringe come out just under the skin. Creating a mini miss lol,Jackboys,1478208886.0

d9kls89,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ayyei/quick_question_about_shooting/,t1_d9kl41o,Are you saying that im not pushing it down all the way and pulling out too early or something?  Whats the change of pressure? Sorry im just trying to get a clear grasp at what youre saying lol,Dopeshooter_mcgavin,1478209740.0

d9km8ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ayyei/quick_question_about_shooting/,t1_d9kls89,"No he's saying even once you've pushed it all in, there's a chance that there's a tiny bit still in the needle that you can't really push out since the plunger is all the way down. To avoid that, I tend to pull a little blood back into the rig and push that down to make sure all the dope is in me. I've had what you're talking about happen before, but it's never been a serious issue. It's likely just a tiny bit of dope that gets sucked out of the tip once you pull out of the vein but not completely out of your skin yet. ",joshualeet,1478210330.0
