dbhmiaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5jnigp/fuck_bioavailability/,t3_5jnigp,"Dude, I would normally disagree with you but it really depends on what you're used to.

If I rail exclusively for a good spell and switch to eating, there is NO comparison. WAY higher. Like ""did I get a fent pressed 30!?!?!?"" higher.

Recently, I've been eating exclusively and then snorted one...just one where I usually eat 2 and got surprisingly high. Been railing for a few days now and it's time to switch back to eating.

I haven't railed a 30 in a good minute but I've been eating percs like candy and that was the comparison I was making.  I didn't think of it but what you're saying definitely makes sense.  I know I just got high af off of one 30 but the day before yesterday I ate 7 perc 10s and didn't feel this high. ,needtopass00,1482374510.0
