This is becoming so popular that they probably can't sticky every single warning that comes out anymore. 

Thanks for the heads up.

Other Fent bags in the 412/724 area have been green/red omg and head trauma, blue/black Miller's, final calls, last chapters, green hulks, red 711s, they keep going bro.. Basically if you're buying dope in the city u can be sure it's either fent cut or garbage anymore. ",Jtmoney23,1466832264.0

And based off the 1 that you did do, do you think if you did the whole 3 like you first planned on, would it have been too much? Or do you think you could have handled it? Generally curious dude.

Couldn't have even been more than a bag left in it (but, as well know, due to how small the amounts of Fent are, the cut/mix is always uneven in strength).

Anyways, I did it, ran outside to throw the sharp away, came back in and sat down and BOOM, it's a half hour later. Totally fell out. No memory of it happening. 

This shit is ridiculous. My dude doesn't use himself, so I've sent him countless messages asking him to PLEASE, PLEASE warn people. ",arcaedia00,1466827379.0
