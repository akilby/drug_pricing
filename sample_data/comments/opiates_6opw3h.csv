I was doing between 3 to 5 roxy 30s a day but it gets expensive fast. I only get paid once a month (I'm in school and live off of my loans/grants). The rest of the month I have to hustle money or sometimes my husband would help me out but he always puts bills/rent/food etc first obviously. At the beginning of the month I'm usually good and could go a week or two of re upping before I run out but when I do or when I was close to the end I'd start scheming for money. Sometimes I would have to go a whole day or a whole morning without and that always sucked. 

Now I'm on methadone, haven't used since 6/20 and my insurance is covering that at the moment so I don't pay anything! Definitely helping me out financially! ",iiMarii,1500665991.0
