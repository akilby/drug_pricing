Dramamine helps a lot with nausea.",hamcheesehamcheese,1551648402.0

That’s one of the side effects of using opioids, mostly when you first start using them.",Blazed_trail,1551653550.0

Doubt it will alleviate any nausea you are having. When you say you snorted Hydrocodone, do you mean you snorted APAP with it as well?  That going up your nose and dripping into your stomach may be the cause of all this

Get some promethazine if you can for the nausea",jcon877,1551646646.0

Edit: snorted 3 norco with 5mg hydro/325mg apap so that is the culprit",gordiss,1551646774.0
ehq0yut,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/awyacv/hydrocodone_nausea/,t1_ehq0go0,Try to keep down 25-50mg of promethazine if you can to help. I haven’t taken suma in years but don’t think that’ll help in this situation ,jcon877,1551647163.0
