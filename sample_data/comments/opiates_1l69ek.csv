Mac LOVED to play. He could jump like 6 ft straight up in the air, it was amazing. And if you didn't pay attention to him, he would make sure he got it. Several times I recall laying on the couch in the living room of my apartment, lights out and watching TV, when this little black bastard would sneak over in the dark with a toy in his mouth (and we gave hi heavy shit... old sneaers, tire pieces, bones) and he'd come up and launch them right at your face, leaving you in shock. I never got mad even though it hurt like fucking hell, and I'd throw his toys for him.
