You have some serious fucked up psychosomatic issues. The way your brain works makes it impossible to develop a tolerance that is ANYTHING more than a mild cold after a week, and not at all after two days. You need to man up and quit convincing yourself you are W/Ding so damn often. You make these posts weekly. In fact, why don't you just read some of the information posted before?",,1328762499.0
c3pck61,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ph78a/how_bad_for_you_is_excess_dph_wd_ques/,t3_ph78a,I wouldnt take anymore for 24 hours. It does dry you out if you take ot like that. I actually take it everynight for sleep 50mg. For w/d dxm actually helpes me good. Also if you have some alcohol and or benzos. Probably not too wose to mix those 2 with dxm though. All these are just suggestions and i have gotten results from all the above. Honestly the best thing would be xanax just dont get hooked on that but you seem to know what you doing so take these words with a grain of sand. White ocean sand from the gulf.,,1328757151.0

c3pe68u,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ph78a/how_bad_for_you_is_excess_dph_wd_ques/,t1_c3pd1wa,"JJ, I think everyone is different. I know my body pretty well. Cold sweats, super sore joints, the runs etc are pretty common w/d effects, and I often get them, just for a much shorter period of time than long term users. I should call it a hangover as opposed to a withdrawal, I suppose, but they are there.

As for ""manning up,"" I've been through some pretty serious medical procedures-palate reconstruction/cleft lip surgery, endocrine related jaw surgeries-mouth wired shut for 4 -6 months at a time, 4x throughout my teen years; reconstructive elbow surgery which required a full arm cast for 6 months. All before I was 18. 

Recently (last 10 years): chemo/radiation for esophageal cancer (caught very early, thank god), reconstructive knee surgery, tonsils+adenoids removed. I've always been told by my doctors that I'm a remarkably good patient; not because I'm not in pain, but because I don't complain much IRL.

My ""brain chemistry"" is probably different because I've been legitimately taking pain killers off an on since puberty. Do I have some ""psycho-somatic"" issues? Yes, I am currently fighting depression. I'd rather not get into why, but it's a pretty darn good reason to be depressed.

 I come here to vent, to ask for and receive some advice, to give advice when I can, and for the sense of camaraderie.  I simply asked if, in addition to the advice I've received in the past,  seroquel would be of any help, and if Immodium is worth the bowel backup.  Sorry if my posts bothers you, but don't question my ""manhood."" That is crossing a line.

Why don't you just ignore my threads from now on? Doesn't RES have a function for that? Thanks.

I have valium, which while not as euphoric as xanax, has a much longer duration and half-life. And I have no idea where you got the idea I know what I'm doing, but thanks? ",danky_druggit,1328770077.0

Look, maybe it IS psychosomatic, but I just woke up at 10am for the 2nd time after waking up at 6am and passing back out-woke up at 10 with my sheets soaked,(not urine, sweat-boxers relatively dry), right hamstring twitching, and then an urgent trip to the can. In fact, the last dream I had was about finding a place to drop a deuce. 

All I'm saying is, my brain has to be pretttty into this mind game to make all this happen while I'm sound asleep.
