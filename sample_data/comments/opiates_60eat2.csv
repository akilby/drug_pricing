df6ee3s,"http://m.imgur.com/GIEfJNJ,q7lT4zw",t1_df5qdd6,"I was just coming here to say the same thing (hospital story). Great advice on the Benadryl! I myself prefer Doxylamine, aka Unisom, usually under sleep aids at the pharmacy, even though it's a super potent anti-H. 

However for me I find that by the time I need antihistamines, at that point my GI tract has slowed down (1Hr in), stopped (2hrs in), and maybe actually going in the reverse direction (3-4 hrs in) where I'm actually a bit nauseous, tad bit pukey, and any pills or meds I swallow just sit in my stomach not really being effective. 

Sometimes it's good to take a tiny dose of antihistamines (a quarter or half of a pill) either before you roll, or simultaneously. That way you get a bit of the antihistamine magic in your system for sure a few minutes ahead of time. 

I say a small dose there, because many folks find that a large dose of antihistamines can alter the purity of the buzz, or even make them too sleepy. So I like to get with a half dose preventatively, and IF its not enough then take another half dose after the fact. ",Poppy_Knight,1490027457.0
