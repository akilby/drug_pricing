Just be careful, a lot of bunk or fent laced OCs going around espically ones originating out of Canada.",Just-Touch-It,1483958761.0

dc75yr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5mvsy1/mundipharm_oc120/,t1_dc6yu7a,"True, but there are also legit OC generics (original abusable formula) widely available in Canada by multiple brands. The fent OC80's coming from Canada are very distinct and are a pill design no longer available so it should be apparent to most (green ""CDN 80"" / OC 80).

I've just heard from the markets and on subs like this of a lot of fent OC's going around which for whatever seems to be rather unique to Canada. It seems like here in the US, it's more fent laced dope or Oxy 30's being produced here which have been my experience. I think it's like that in the US due to the original OC's being practically nonexistent once they made the switch over to the OP's. ",Just-Touch-It,1483997184.0
