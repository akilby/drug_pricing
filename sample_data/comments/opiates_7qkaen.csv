My gut feeling though is that you wouldn't want to risk taking anything that may latch on to your opiate receptors. Just do your best to wait until you can safely dose the subs. As far as lope goes, considering the negative effect of taking the amount necessary to get any tangible relief, if you can avoid using it at all then you'll be better off regardless of whether or not it may cause problems with the subs. 

Others may be able to chime in based on their personal experience though ",Sexwithhorses,1516039442.0

dsqv1wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7qkaen/subs_and_lope/,t1_dsqn3y8,"That has been my experience as well, that the best way to do a sub induction is to verryyy gradually dose. I can't say for sure but I think it may have something to do with the fact that when you take small amounts slowly like that, the partial agonist buperenorphine doesn't strip away the full agonist dope from the receptor right away. Intuitively that would make sense",Sexwithhorses,1516070904.0
dsq5pb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7qkaen/subs_and_lope/,t1_dsq5b5r,"Yeah, so if you can make it without then definitely do it. If you have any non-opi comfort meds like Lyrica, gabapentin, benzos, or clonidine maybe take those instead? If you're worried about getting the shits in particular or something (though ime that's rarely a problem early in withdrawal) and you think immodium would help, I'm sure taking the as-recommended dose of a couple tablets would be fine. 

At least 25%+ of the battle is just not psyching yourself up about it. I know it can suck ass to withdraw at work but if you do your best to keep your mind occupied and then gradually dose subs once you're in full blown physical withdrawals you'll be fine I think. Personally I think the key to subs is dosing very slowly -- tiny sliver & wait ~20 mins, repeat until you're well. ",Sexwithhorses,1516044578.0

I.e, 2 - 4 milligrams. Which is all you need to stop mudbutt - and nowhere near the PWD vicinity. If you seriously are concerned you might be squirting out you butthole at work? Take the lope man. Trust me on this. I’ve also NOT taken the lope before sub induction while being at work and that was a decision I reeeeeaaally regret :( trust me",Completelyshitfaced,1516077493.0

I'm in school now and only working part time, but recently when i was working in an office i could basically go wherever the fuck I wanted without people noticing... I would slip out and take shots in the bathroom on other floors/in the foodcourt area of another building, I even met clients to sell dope in between meetings lmao.

So yeah if you work in an office building maybe you can walk elsewhere? Take an early lunch break? Idk. But like I said taking immodium just for shits with the normal dose (not an excessive dose intended to alleviate withdrawal) should be totally fine",Sexwithhorses,1516047200.0
