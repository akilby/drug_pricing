My worst was probably stealing money from the bank. Not like armed robbery, but I had accounts at 4 different banks at one point early in my addiction. All 4 banks had ATMs where you could deposit a check/cash through the ATM and up to $100 was available immediately, before they even processed the check or cash. I would wait for the bank to close for the day, to make sure they wouldn't find out for at least 12 hours or so, and ""deposit"" whatever piece of paper I had on me. Sometimes it would be a dollar bill, sometimes a piece of notebook paper folded up. Stick it in the envelope and tell the ATM there was really $100+ in there. 

After that, it was as simple as putting my card back in and making a $100 withdrawal. Of course they always found out once they processed the actual deposit, and my account would be overdraft whatever I didn't actually deposit, plus I'd get hit with a $30 fee. I'm surprised they never reported me to the fuzz, because it was essentially check/bank fraud. And I did it quite a few times with each account I had. I would always put the money back in for real once I got paid, but it was an easy way to get well in a pinch.",dmanDE,1404271912.0

You'd be surprised at how much money you could make in a week of doing this, you just have to have a sense of value for different kinds if shit. Start with what you know, whether it's electronics/clothing/jewelry whatever. Buy low sell high. Check out as many places as you can, you never know what you're going to find. The longer you do this kind of shit, the more knowledgeable you become and you will be able to find value in a bag of horse shit.

Odd jobs. Go around your neighborhood with your sob story and offer to do any kind of work (yard work, car cleaning, house cleaning, computer work, moving furniture, whatever) for anything that can be spared. It helps if you are a likeable person with a bright personality who doesn't look like a piece of shit, people generally have no problem helping out a fellow neighbor and human being if you don't look like you're crAcked out / are just trying to raise money to get your next crack sack.

Steal shit from Wal-Mart, Safeway, Home Depot etc. Return items to a different store or location for store credit / cash if you have a receipt that you found/had and sell that credit for cash, or even trade it for drugs straight up haha. Sell video games/accessories to Gamestop for straight cash. Sell other misc. valuable shit to pawn stores/Craigslist/eBay. Use your imagination junkie, the options are endless.

Middle man for people. Nothing beats throwing down with a local tweaker who you don't give a fuck about through your plug with your only $20 and getting twice as much for yourself as you would if you didn't plug a sack for Two Toothed Timmy. Who cares if he's a terrible person and smells like pickles, you're about to get twice as high buddy!

I could go on and on but this is boring lol. There are many, many, mannnny different ways to hustle up money, but the bottom line is that you have to get off your ass and do something if you want to make some easy money. Money doesn't come easy (usually)

""Homeless and Hungry, anything helps, god bless."" Some people will throw change at you or give you apples, but a lot of people are generous with 1 dollar bills and above. I got a $50 dollar bill once and a $10 on numerous occasions. You have to pick the right intersection, though, and be prepared to fight the other bums that want to fly there.

Cardboard sign and sit at a busy intersection with foot traffic.  Dont do it on another bum's territory though unless you want a fight.

Steal from a store, return to same store but different location.  Make sure they offer cash refunds.

Put ad on Craigslist for women for man, ask for pics, pretend to want a married man because its easier and more discreet.  Blackmail those SOB's

Pretend to have money and rob a drug dealer

Wear fake police shit and rob a whole drug set
