drduith,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7kf28g/did_some_meth_last_night/,t3_7kf28g,"Looking at the comments I might be in the minority but IV meth is my jam. I think it's the most powerful rush early 21st century drug use has to offer. If you do a decent shot you have to shut the fuck up, lay on your back and just breathe through it because it's just so intense. I've never had it happen myself but IV meth can literally make you cum in your pants. Like it's that good. That alone puts it above any other drug administered via IV. ",Cujuabled,1513535510.0

The rush was similiar to coke id say but coke is way more intense and more of what I prefer. To each his own though as it is with all drugs. My jaw was fucked for the next two days lol",TMgolf24,1513534447.0
