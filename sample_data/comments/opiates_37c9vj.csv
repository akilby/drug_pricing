I have been ignorant about auto immune deficiency. Never had allergy problems in my life till recently. Eye kept getting blood shot like pink eye without the gunk, eye doctor gave me eye drops and told me was allergy and how I should get blood work done. I had this dumb mentality that you are born with any possible allergies.
Maybe you can cross thread this to /r/medical 

I have faith in Reddit, we will get some answers.

It happens literally every time I drink tea now. But that's strange to me. Obviously there are more variety of alkaloids in tea than dope, but you'd still think ""an opiates an opiates an opiate"". Weird one would have that effect yet the others don't. ",Junk_Star,1436463346.0
