Aside from maybe opana if I ever found any around here, I doubt I could get high off pharms without being out $120-$180 just to feel maybe a little euphoria for like 2-3 hours... and then Iâ€™d be kicking myself wishing I got a few buns instead.",circle-spinner,1522520556.0

https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/886q6c/comment/dwiczbc?st=JFEB7JV2&sh=527822b7

But severe panic disorder and insomnia with recurring nightmares that wake me up still sort of delusional stemming from being stabbed which gives me panic attacks when certain minorityâ€™s are behind me (sounds racist I know) and anytime I get in a car followed by constant anxiety in the car whether Iâ€™m driving or not. Thatâ€™s for the benzos and oxy/Soma/Tizanidine I take. I have MRIs/X-Rays and all that.",IAmVerizonGuy,1522436402.0
dwjlwf0,https://i.redd.it/8mkut543yxo01.jpg,t1_dwjlb7p,"I have my family doctor, who gives me Tizanidine 2mg x90 TID and runs blood tests etc. My psychiatrist gives me Klonopin 1mg x90 TID Temazepam 15mg x14 PRN. PM doctor started me on 120 10mg Oxycodone but couldnâ€™t handle it so downgraded to 60 plus it lowered my MMI. He prescribes 60 10mg Oxycodone BID, Soma 350mg x10 PRN for extreme muscle pain and Xanax 1mg x60 BID. 

Theyâ€™re all aware of each other and the prescriptions each is giving me. If I lose either my psych or PM doctor Iâ€™m fucked though. ",IAmVerizonGuy,1522436698.0

It was prescribed TID but itâ€™s mainly PRN. I didnâ€™t even ask for it. Then the Soma for breakthrough pain. He offered OxyContin 40mg but I denied it. Also offered bupe which I turned down due to the half life, Methadone which I turned down for the same reasons. Medical Marijuana because it doesnâ€™t help me. Just induced severe anxiety and hallucinations. ",IAmVerizonGuy,1522439891.0
