Glad you found a true businessman of the game, sounds like he'll treat you well. How long you been using opes for?",ascan_nerdarkly,1407819223.0

I finally found a decent hook-up after a few years, I was ripped off a lot due to being a skinny fuck and I'll admit I was a push-over until I decided to fight someone that ripped me off.  Normally I just wanted to be a pacifist but I needed to finally stick up for myself.  I'm pretty opposed to connecting drugs and violence.  It feels like I am making drugs look worse if I use violence.",Op8ed,1407825710.0

I'd gotten rid of all my used ones the week before when I took a break from using and I didn't feel like going to every pharmacy in the area to try get new ones. It was faster and easier to buy off the street that one time. ",hammontre,1407857678.0
