I just read through some of your post history (because I am on the toilet trying to take a massive dope shit and its hurting and its been 40 minutes) Anyways. I see that you've got some prior health conditions that are pretty serious. I hope that they will continue you on all the medications that you rightfully deserve because of your condition. I see that you're on a pump and stuff too. Hopefully they will take good care of you! My thoughts are with you! and sending you lots of positive energy!

Lol. I'm a white girl with a green card who has lived in the US for 15+ years, but I got in a little trouble a few years ago that I plead guilty to just to make it go away. Was advised at that time that it would have zero effect on my status. But it drew ICE's attention to me, I guess -- and the rules of the immigration game are much different these days with the current administration. Anyway, it doesnt help that their files had me as a 20 year old black male with a bunch of felonies who does not have a green card (somehow completely different names and files got switched -- that part is straightened out now at least, but not before being detained for 6+ weeks). 

Anyway, long story short(er)... they screwed up and basically arrested me for no valid reason, but that still leaves me having to fight the case and prove all of these things. I would still be in their detention facility if it werent for the fact that I very nearly died multiple times (timewise, I literally spent more in the hospital than I did at the jail). I was too expensive and too risky for them to keep, especially with the recent criticism they've been facing. That's literally the only reason I'm out. The facility I was at only releases something like 3% of the people that get arrested. Its crazy. People with green cards, and even citizenship, sit there for YEARS sometimes because the system is so inefficient, and then get deported. You have a very small chance of winning your case if you are detained when your court case comes around. The whole situation is really scary and I had NO clue before. Definitely opened my eyes, and put me in a situation I thought I would NEVER be in (I am NOT from a country that you would expect anyone to have these problems and literally everyone I met, including ICE staff was like ""wait.. why are you here? WTF?"") Sure does make me wish I would have just gotten citizenship at some point in t he past decade and a half but it was always a ""meh, who cares? As long as I'm not committing felonies the only thing I cant do is vote"" sort of thing... yet here I am in this situation.. Anyway... thats more detail than you wanted, lol",Clvrusername808,1544182461.0
