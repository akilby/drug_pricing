Oh ya, don't even think about snorting it. It will burn your face off. You will thank me later for not snorting it.",KickerS12X,1441465892.0

You can freebase and smoke it.  Simple base extraction and filter with a Buchner basically.  I did it once, and the results were amazing.  Huge potency increase.

Someone once said to me on the other hand: once you abuse your maintenance meds where do you go next?  There are no second tier maintenance meds.

Put it all in perspective, and I just drink it as of a long time.",zystyl,1441469880.0
