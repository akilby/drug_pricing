Usually you need a mirror to see your vein pop out and know where to inject. That one time though I was sick as hell and in a ghetto bathroom with no mirrors or reflecting surfaces of any kind. It was cold and I was dehydrated, so other veins weren't possible to hit.

So what do I do? Dumbass me with no regard for future me injects into the side of my neck WITHOUT LOOKING. I went by feel. Same place I always shoot up in, except no mirror. I basically pulled back a bit, then pushed down. No resistance or burning so I kept on pushing down. Eventually, I missed a few units and it burns like fuck. Cauliflowering skin and everything, so I prolly had a histamine reaction.

Wound up getting well and then some though, since I hit the vein for most of my shot. Talk about dumb luck!",His_Dudeness_94,1498495043.0

p.s. arteries are def dangerous dude; whoever told you they're okay to use is a fucking moron. beyond that, they're a waste of a shot bc they carry blood away from yr heart, so you'll just succeed in making whatever part of yr body that you shot into blow the fuck up.",blkkttn,1498535808.0
