Once a month I have a girl that sells me 50 rox 15s and if I buy all 50 at once she will give it to me for $12 each. Some people seriously are spending thousands of dollars a week on pills, so youâ€™re gonna have to do better than 8 at a time to get bulk if I was guessing.",medicatedwiz420,1518504361.0
du61idk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7x7605/pricing_question/,t3_7x7605,8 isnâ€™t considered bulk to someone with probably a couple hundred pills. if you buy 20-30+ youâ€™d probably get a better deal. ,Lo717,1518499629.0
du619cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7x7605/pricing_question/,t3_7x7605,"Not really, 8/$80 isnâ€™t really very much to begin with a lot of people spend hundreds and some even thousands. People that have them and knows whatâ€™s up know that oxy will sell itself. Wasnâ€™t uncommon for then 8-10 people I knew selling would be out  within the day.. two at MOST and weâ€™re talking about 1000â€™s of pills at a time. So anyhow, yeah thatâ€™s how it works with most drugs but unlike most drugs pharma opiates are a little harder to come me by for the seller and more so the buyer so donâ€™t *usually* get a bulk discount.",FlipFlopSuicide,1518499267.0

I grabbed a few for back up so I also only got 10 of them. I think it's normal ish. Good pricing on them is when I buy over 50 the guy lowers to 6 each. Under that is 7 each. 10 and under is 8 each. They have a quantity scale I guess. If your guy doesn't, he should. 
My regular are the oxy 40s though. ",gunmetalblue60,1518499171.0

They always charged 10 each and never gave a discount no matter how many I purchased, so the same as you. However, the 30's guy would give me discounts for multiples so that's why I always preferred that. Of course this is when I lived in the North East. Now I can't find any percs at all.
