Drink a lot of water, take some Ibuprofen, and Zofran if you have it. You'll be alright.",dopefiend2690,1463848630.0

PST in particular has a wide spectrum of active ingredients, so you're going to want to give your body all the help it can get in processing and filtering out these alkaloids.

That said, after indulging in _any_ opiate after a tolerance break, I find that I get a pretty strong feeling of being hungover.  So at least in my experience, this is completely normal.  You'll feel better soon.

Also, and this is my unsolicited opinion, be careful with imbibing PST on a regular basis.  I found it to be so long-lasting and relatively cheap that I used it daily for several weeks to make my work-days go by in a breeze, and was surprised at the intensity and duration of withdrawal.  The qualities that make PST such a broad-spectrum, long-lasting high are equally the qualities that can make its withdrawal so difficult.  You probably know all that, but I thought I'd remark upon it nonetheless :-)",3_tiered_shitdyke,1463856275.0
