Atleast try to get something stronger. You have a legitimate reason to need them.. I wouldn't give up so easily, young guy. ",dope_eloped,1391490230.0

His goal for me is to ween me off completely, but the last time I complained about still being in pain, he upped me back to what I started at.  I want to find a new guy (my mom keeps trying to get me into her office), but I'm out of a job, and thus out of insurance at the moment.  At least the guy I'm seeing gives me a deal on visits because of my situation.",ctopi32,1391490955.0

Edit: without too much detail, both Bridgeport and New Haven are pretty short drives for me.  Norwalk is a bit further, but I hate going down that way due to usual traffic.",ctopi32,1391494498.0
