Your description sounds like how I would describe morphine, cuz for me, heroin feels like it's in my head. It feels like my head gets clogged up for a second and I get wobbly, with a slight adrenaline like feeling, but very slightly. I know it's a good shot when my sinuses are permeated with that sweet vinegar smell, and when it feels like I need to pop my ears",suburbiaresident,1396992548.0

By the time I'm at like 8 I get this feeling in my stomach like I just got kicked or something. Then slight pins and needles in my face. Then waves of euphoria. Kind of like a roller coaster almost.

1,2,3,4 .....I usually should feel it by... a small stirring in my stomach for a milisecond. It instantly spreads out. I feel a heaviness in my breath and chest. I can taste it in the back of my mouth. Everything squeezes together like my body is hugging itself from the inside. Warmth and bliss spreads faster and faster hitting my head hard. Ahhh its going hard now and I feel every opiate warmth high in one for a couple of seconds. I let the rush and high consume me. This is the moment that cannot be beaten. Even in opiate bliss you can think about your problems- they just matter a lot less. That rush though... during that rush the high is so good you cannot will yourself to do, think, or feel anything but the experience and greatness of it all. Then I am king of reality and get to look forward to any activity for a couple of hours.

Something like that... good thing I haven't shot up in 7 months. :)",,1397007428.0

My DoC is dilly, & that rush is all in my head, then when the rush ends it fades out into my body in waves. The rush always scares me for a split second - the best description I have is that there is suddenly 5 times the chemicals in my brain & they're making my frontal lobe super heavy.

Happens to me every time.

I know I'm about to be bombarded my warmth and awesomeness when that taste comes.

Was even considering making a thread about it. I mean do you or does anyone else get that distinctive taste when the rush happens?",ihavenospacebar420,1397092753.0

Hearing that he's officially out and in the halfway house makes me legit cheese smile, which I haven't done in what feels like forever, so thank you for that. I think you were responsible for my last smile too! Hopefully next time we speak you'll have some more good news and we can go for the hat trick!
