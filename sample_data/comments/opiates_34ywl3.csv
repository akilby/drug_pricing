That was a fun story mate! I hope most of it was as accurate as possible. Kym sounds like a fucking goddess, exactly the kind of women I want! Bro I wanna come to your guys wedding if you ever have one, it would be off the hook with that chick running the show!

But seriously I can just feel the freedom vibrating from this chick, as she drives away in a stolen car. It's that feeling of endless possibilities. This to me is like a novelized version of what an Opiate high is like, fucking wild bro!",,1430852636.0

I'm sure you two will be very unhappy together for a short time before the wheels come off and you're lives crash into a wall of drama and stupidity. Do the human race a huge solid and use birth control with Kym so the clearly flawed genes that you two have don't get passed on and society doesn't have to deal with your children (who would obviously be retarded) in fact consider getting snipped, I doubt you'll be getting any smarter so a permanent solution might be in order to avoid inflicting your offspring on the rest of us.
