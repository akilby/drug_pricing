Maybe just try bigger doses? If you're not getting bad side effects then I wouldn't trash it just yet until trying some more.

Snorting doesn't work too well with #3. It will work, but it's not optimal. It's really best to smoke, or IV/plug after adding some sort of acid (citric or ascorbic).",OxyCaughtIn,1514596193.0
drxng1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxmqif,"Alright cool! I thought maybe that because it wasn't a powder like the last sample I had it might have just been some shit stuff :/ Im only a newb when it comes to H so probably just have to get used to all the different colours and consistencies.

Yeah now that you mention it, I smoked some when I first got it and had a mild buzz but as far as sniffing it there's not that much an effect at all, maybe I need to rack up a bigger line lol ",MR-IZUS,1514597106.0
drxnnje,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxng1n,"Like I said, snorting #3 doesn't work as well as snorting #4 so you will be wasting some if you do it that way. Mixing with a weak acid and plugging would be a great way to try it.",OxyCaughtIn,1514597372.0
drxo8s3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxnnje,"I think I am a bit confused on the whole #3 and #4 :/ is #3 not powdered form and #4 not like black tar? I always thought that but I must be wrong cause this stuff is like powder and can easily be snorted no problem, I would maybe consider giving plugging a go but have never done with any other drug so I will have to have a good think about it haha I do know it has a good bioavailability ",MR-IZUS,1514598131.0
drxov6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxo8s3,"/#3 is freebase form. As in it doesn't have a salt attached to it. So it's just the heroin molecule and nothing else (not counting cut)

/#4 has a salt attached (most commonly HCl) to the heroin molecule. #4 is more soluble in water whereas #3 doesn't dissolve in water very much at all. That's why you need to add an acid to convert it to it's salt form for IV or plugging. That's why it doesn't absorb in the mucous membranes of your nose well either. 

Black tar is just made with a different process than powder form #4. It's less refined and has left over stuff from production that give it it's tar consistency. But both tar and ECP are #4 heroin.",OxyCaughtIn,1514598923.0
drxpjpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxov6c,"Thanks for clearing that up for me! I was a bit confused about the whole numbers, so I would reckon then the really powdery sample I got would have been #4 and then this sample I have now would be #3, I think I will just smoke the rest of it and see how that goes, I will have to do my research a bit more lol ",MR-IZUS,1514599804.0
drxrpg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxpjpr," Not necessarily, #3 can come powdery just as much as #4. And not tar #4 comes in rocks very often as well.",OxyCaughtIn,1514602519.0
ds35cak,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7mye0q/h_3_question/,t1_drxrpg3,whoah! so it can basically just come in all types of consistencies whatever the number? is there any # that can be good for both smoking and snorting? ,MR-IZUS,1514914761.0
