If they gave me their number and one of his boys messsed me over id call them and he would get it straight, usually by giving me alot more than i was suppose to or hed call his boy and tell him get in line. But i was in a big city and if they did it more than once and the og didnt do anything about it, id find another person or go through a friend and brake them off.

Im not the biggest or the baddest but at the same time i was paying for thier kids to eat and have the shoes they wanted and so theyd respect you for the most part if i could communicate with them. I havr bad social anxiety also especially with dealers but the ogs usually knew that and aslong as me or my people came straight and kept it real, they kept it real",idkagudname,1544014876.0

If they short me and don't make it up the next time, or if they have me waiting for ever, I'm on to the next one.

If you let people get over on you they're not gonna stop. 

I used to be nervous about cold copping too. But it gets easier, i actually liked doing it now. If you don't have the confidence, just act like you do. The whole fake it till you make it thing. ",EskomojoE,1544033105.0
