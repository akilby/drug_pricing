This shocked me, I'm pretty curious about drugs and when he died I started researching about heroin. We thought we ""won"" the war on H in my country, it's hard to get an opiate prescribed here, bare in mind ibuprofen 600 needs a prescription here but lately a new ""yellow heroin"" as the media calls it made the news, people dropping like flies, I think it's laced with fent and at least they colour it but still, looks like we went back to 1970 where it was the main drug in the scene here.

So much respect for all of you struggling with this battle",Iliveonthem00n,1549028084.0
