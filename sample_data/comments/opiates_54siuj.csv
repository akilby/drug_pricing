Not to say they aren't out there but because subs tend to make you feel normal and not high (*generally* guys) whereas methadone gets you high all day and nods you out, you don't NEED to get high as badly on `done.
Maybe it's just the company I keep, but I've met some real serious fiends that were on subs.

d85kctj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/54siuj/considering_methadone/,t1_d850ifw,yeah this is pretty much the overall impression i get as well. everyone that was on subs or started with me has quit the program or gotten kicked off and theyre all using. the methadone people i know use coke and smoke weed sometimes but theyre not using dope... for the most part. just after a year of not being my normal everyday using self i still want to use every chance i get. im just scared of methadone and that it wont really be any different.,dusthood,1475075568.0
d84rll3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/54siuj/considering_methadone/,t1_d84mw2w,Bupenephrine is actually being developed to treat depression.  I believe a company has found a way to block it from activating the opiate receptors in your brain.  It was a couple of years back when I read about that.  That was when I was doing some research into Belbuca.  Which is much better than shitty butrans.,Icebox2016,1475017031.0

I used to take OC 80s later in the day, because I was a hopeless junky and they were $15 but I certainly didn't need them.
Methadone is good enough on it's own.
 I think you'll do fine.
