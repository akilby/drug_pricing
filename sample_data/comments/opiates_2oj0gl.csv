I was told it could happen as soon as 8 hours or so. I would be more concerned with bacterial growth in the syringes personally, unless I was using brand new equipment and syringe filters every time (a good investment regardless of course!) I mean, others have said they still used shots that were up to a week or more old and were fine, but I personally would not risk it more than maybe 6-8 hours unless micron filtered (a 0.22um filter basically sterilizes the liquid.) If more than a day or two, I would also use bacteriostatic water as well (you can make this yourself by mixing sterile water with benzyl alcohol so it is 0.9-1% alcohol. ",916x,1417933503.0

Everything was super sterile and each rig was brand new. It'd last me a few days, and i never had an issue. Id just prep it as clean as possible, make ur shots, put the cap back on, store them in the dark n at room temp, and ull be good.

cmnsncx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2oj0gl/making_ready_to_go_shots/,t1_cmnls1e,"Yea this is very very true. Depending on the PH of the water, a certain percentage will undergo hydrolysis of the 3-acetyl first followed by the 6-acetyl even less though. Acid or base can catalyze hydrolysis. I'm not sure what the ideal PH is for storing, but I could do the calculations if I wasn't so lazy and feeling nice from this shot. But yea as soon as you dissolve it in water, some will instantly degrade. The more water, the more degradation will occur as it pushes the equilibrium by having more reactant. But it's impossible to avoid some degradation, that's just chemistry in a solution. ",OptionalAccountant,1417964044.0
