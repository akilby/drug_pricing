edheb2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/adj882/being_sober_definitely_sucks_but_its_not_nearly/,t3_adj882,What was your dosage and how often. We're you doing it before you took this break? It sounds to me like you must not have had a higher tolerance addiction if it was pretty easy ,goldslapper100,1546878913.0

Im definetly not trying to make it seem like its easy to get sober i know how hard it can be. Its just not as bad as i thought it would.

Same oxy dosage (blue 30s) and when I didnt take those I'd also smoke weed and pop xans just to have something else going on. I will say tho my habit did progress to daily use and then eventually H so I just gotta say be careful man. Don't take this rather simple time of quitting as reason to believe you can use more and still get away with quitting easily. 

I understand not everyone will follow the same path I did, but it is a very possible outcome if your not careful. ",goldslapper100,1546882493.0

I would advise you to be careful with the benzos though and take it easy on them and don't do them every day, cuz they are physically addictive just like opiates, except the withdrawal is worse and can cause seizures and in some extreme cases, even death.",clickclvck,1546933028.0
