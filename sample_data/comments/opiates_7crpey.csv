If you usually slam your shit maybe just stick to snorting. Keep you from going to deep. And be thankful for being able to enjoy yourself.,pyr088,1510619892.0

dps69hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7crpey/about_to_relapse/,t3_7crpey,"I know what you mean especially if hes on the way already. But technically its not too late to change your mind. Either way just be extremely careful!! As you know, your tolerance has dropped immensely. I can't even tell you how many ppl I've lost from relapsing right after jail, rehab, or months/years of clean time. Just start of slow with a tiny bit. I only had 7 days of clean time after a 2g habit a day. And I only did a freaking point and was ROCKED. So you can always do more just not the other way around.

dpsjugw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7crpey/about_to_relapse/,t3_7crpey,I just relapsed after being clean for 20 days because of subs. Used 3 days in a row and it wasn't even worth it now I feel like I'm back at square one and I just want to keep going luckily I managed to chill for 36 hours long enough to take some suboxone,heroinsmarionette,1510637205.0

Your going to regret this after the high is gone. Regardless what you do, remember your tolerance is a lot lower, so start small and be safe.",spinderella69,1510619912.0
dps81z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7crpey/about_to_relapse/,t1_dps4zqg,Yea I have only shot up like 5-6 times before. That was right before I quit 6 months ago. Always snorted other then that. I snorted 2 points and I'm high as fuck right now. Threw up twice and feel great! It's been like 3+ years since I have threw up from any type of opiates. Feels great but of course I'm slightly feeling guilty. But it's most def just a little slip lol. Just wanted to feel that warmness again;)),dabbiscuits,1510623315.0
dps85pw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7crpey/about_to_relapse/,t1_dps5107,Little late for that but I really appreciate the word of advise. And your right. I'm nodding hard and already feeling bad about it. Only did two points and I'm ripped. And I had a 2 gram a day habit if not more just 6 months ago. ,dabbiscuits,1510623424.0
