I would have what I need to maintain a reasonable level of happiness, but no...I got so it til it's gone, then spend a day or two sweating it out like a dumbass.

It's a *skeletal* muscle relaxer, meaning it relaxes the muscles holding your bones together, not your normal muscles. And, even if you take enough to feel effects, I've found those effects to be quite uncomfortable. Why take those, of all potentiators?",PCsNBaseball,1424649148.0

Two of these three are involuntary and so if it acted upon them it could be fatal. Skeletal muscles are all muscles that are voluntary from abs to biceps and so on. To say they are muscles to hold your bones together is hilarious. Ligaments attach bone to bone.",54883,1424653606.0
