I always heard that you are mostly ok if you miss a single dose due the long half life of methadone. You might not feel 100% but good enough to get thru a work day.
Certainly not bed ridden ans vomiting 24 hours since the last dose.",Justlurkin4321,1542469289.0

I think I do have a few clonadine and flexeril laying around somewhere as well. 

These clinics are such shit around here, she has a job for the first time in a year, works late evenings and she has to get up early every morning to get to the clinic 45 minutes away that is only open for like 5 hours a day, then go back to sleep and go to her job, then find time to go to some group meeting at another location twice a week. If she makes one mistake or needs to switch clinics and they fuck up the paperwork they just turn her away. Makes no sense, leaves her with the option of either go back to using street drugs or get too sick to work and lose her job. Not sure how the hell this is supposed to help someone with recovery, with all the hoops she has to jump through the drugs still control her life just as much as before. ",trp1784,1542433941.0

Has she thought about getting onto bupe? I know it's not for everyone but shit.. If she has to go thru withdrawals anyhow why not do the taper from the methadone and make the switch. At least she can take it home and get it from her regular Dr (maybe, if Dr has licence). 

It should help.  Clonadine helps a lot with the hot  and cold chills, gooseflesh and sweats more than anything.  Hot showers, heating pads.. and lots of Gatorade, crackers and toast. ",TATP1982,1542434946.0

Whatever the solution it's really important that she's well enough to hold down her job, keeps her occupied and gives her hope that things will get better. Before she was working she couldn't stay clean or commit to any kind of treatment because she was just so depressed and had no hope for the future. Until today this is the longest I've seen her happy and not constantly abusing drugs since she started using them. ",trp1784,1542451779.0
e9vx63k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9xtvxn/what_can_i_do_to_help_my_sister_with_opiate/,t1_e9vfj8r,"Bupe is difficult to transition to for some people.  It doesn't give the same feeling as fill agonist opiates and the naloxone in suboxone messes with some people.  You have to give it more than a week to get the most benefit. If she can manage to deal with the detox for a few days, jump to bupe and then stay strong for about a week until she stabilizes, she will be in the clear.  

I was clean for 2.5 years on bupe but messed up last week and paid the price this week. However, I have to keep chugging on. I told my Dr what I did and she upped my dose (I had been tapering for over a year) to reduce craving for a while.  Any clinic that really cares about their patients and their recovery, would not do what this place has done to your sister. It's what drives people to the streets and to death. It should be fucking illegal. 

I hope the best for your sis! Wish her luck for me and let her know that there is a whole community of people who know what she is dealing with and are here to help support her.  ",TATP1982,1542466895.0
