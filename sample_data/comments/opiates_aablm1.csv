I would ask your doc to put you on a 15mg of oxycodone 3x daily instead and tell him that your having these problems in the morning. I remember after my surgery they gave me Percocet 10s and the Tylenol really fucked with my stomach so after 2 months I asked for somthing without Tylenol and they gave me oxycodone 15mg IR 3-4x daily. No side effects after switching. ,benzoluverGG249,1546014247.0

From the sounds of it, you're actually experiencing negative effects long before the next morning most of the time (I get that it is also happening the next day) so not really a hangover, rather than a ""bad trip"".

It does sound like you are maybe taking more than you are tolerant to, so try adjusting your doses downwards to see if this helps.

You are also absolutely right in saying that hydration will play a major part in this awful feeling, so make sure to get plenty fluids. 

My last suggestion would be to make sure you are eating enough, having a even a mini binge on too little food will fuck u up, so yeah get your dose in then eat something (if u ain't hungry then make it something densely calorific/fatty) about 30 mins to and hour after ",forcere2,1546018146.0

I did this with my doc and went from 120 perc 10s to 120 30mg IR oxycodone.  ,benzoluverGG249,1546045038.0

I think what happens a lot of time is I forget to ear, drink water, etc.. and then also if I try to dose more than 2-3 times a day I just feel like shit. As long as I dose once then dont redose for another 6 hours or so I dont get that feeling. ",JimBob1232,1546028947.0
