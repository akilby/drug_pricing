My shots are usually 50 units of water. This is personal preference of course. I just dislike injecting something that looks akin to ink and being able to actually see blood when I register. But I have a lot of personal rituals and such associated with how I shoot. ",TheOtherWhiteGirl,1401389785.0

HOWEVER, if you use more water you get more units in the shot, so if you accidentally pull out or go tgrougg the vein you have less that gets wasted.

I've never understood the issue with seeing the blood upon registering though, because when you pull back the plunger you're gonna be able to immediately tell if your in regardless of the water/dopes color, and the vacuum method is also valuable in being able to tell instantly when you do get in. Sure you don't see it fill up the water the same as a clear shot, but that doesn't really make a difference (other than looking pretty).",ritchiesrainbow,1401390397.0
