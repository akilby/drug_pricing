I guess you could grind the subutex into a powder and dose that way.  How do you like the taste of subutex? They taste like shit huh?  As for how long to wait you should wait approximately 24 hours.  ,Icebox2016,1475024088.0

Google it or look on /r/suboxone /r/bupe~ Regardless, if u wanna quit I would use the grace period time you have for this last subutex and find plenty of xans or kpins at least 10 and just go ahead and quit

If you dissolve one into 10mL of water, you can titrate the smaller doses more accurately than cutting them. Should be a dollar or two at any pharmacy. Just use sterile water and keep the solution in the oral syringe, it should be good for quite a while. ",Iamthefly55595472,1475106099.0

d84y32w,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/54ttyc/question_about_suboxonesubutex_tapering/,t1_d84wc66,Suboxone doesn't taste bad.  When I went with someone whom would get subutex I feared tasting that nasty white fucking pill more than I did going into withdrawal.  I guess to maybe fight the taste I could of got some breath mints but fuck it.  ,Icebox2016,1475026890.0
