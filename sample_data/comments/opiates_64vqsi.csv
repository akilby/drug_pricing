dg5hwus,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/64vqsi/kratom_blocking_opiates/,t3_64vqsi,Yeah I would abstain from kratom for 24-36 hours to achieve desired effects from your doc.,Iamfriendly4488,1491973139.0

Been off of kratom for a while-totally clean off of everything in fact. Then a couple days ago I took some percocets which used to get me feeling really nice (obviously I have low tolerance), but now don't even have any effect on me. So yeah-I feel like long term kratom use may change tolerance  to other opiates-at least in my case, and it sounds like in your case this may have happened too...",Drdrandrangus,1492015666.0
dg5hka2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/64vqsi/kratom_blocking_opiates/,t1_dg5gz63,I don't feel the opiate euphoria. It's like the magic is gone. Before I started Kratom my tolerance wasn't even that high ,johnnyszn,1491972489.0
