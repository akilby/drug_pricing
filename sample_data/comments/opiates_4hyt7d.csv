d2tlr7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4hyt7d/they_call_me_fingaz/,t3_4hyt7d,Recently burned the crap out of my finger and blanket doing this. After I did it I instantly lit another up and continued the nod. My finger bubbled up like half an inch with a puss filled bubble I went to work and didn't even remember burning my finger saying wtf is that thing on my finger!!,Demty,1462441005.0

I remember the change happened in Goverment because so many people were actually dying from falling asleep with lit smokes, and burning their houses down -with them asleep inside. Coincidentally they don't taste as good. Plus, pack of 25 smokes in Australia also now cost over $30. And under the Turnbull government with be closer to $40 by 2017... Not a word of a lie.

All my clothes have burns and even stuff like my desk and my chair and other shit. Since I stopped dope they've been happening less, but I still tend to sorta nod on my methadone and drop cigs... or when I do dope occasionally and nod It'll happen more. I feel so dumb for it, and I'm so glad I haven't burned the house down... I should just keep the cig in the ashtray when I'm not hitting it, but for some reason it just stays in my left hand (i have brownish/yellow stained fingers from cigs lol)...",n0dsquad,1462442468.0

Our weed prices aren't too bad here actually! As it's grown here incredibly easily it doesn't have to imported. The market is stable and it's always readily available. Has been for decades. I'm interested to see if it being legalised (at least for medicinal use) recently will have any affect on the black market bud though! We are behind the states here with drug policy but we are slowly coming around. Won't be all that long before its legalised completely, I hope! We shall see ‚úåÔ∏è",Completelyshitfaced,1462524775.0
