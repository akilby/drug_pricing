Let me explain this before people start looking at me sideways through the interweebz. I did a lot of heroin in prison, when I couldn't get heroin, I would snort suboxone. It makes a massive difference snorted versus sublingual, I promise. 1mg of suboxone sublingual...nothing, 1mg of suboxone snorted...has me feeling good.

We would take an eighth of a strip or so and put it in a small toothpaste cap and put a few drops of water in there and snort it. I have seen people get blasted off of 1/32 of a strip (0.25mg) and be puking for 8 hours.",KickerS12X,1514687968.0

Sometimes I’ll wait a day and then IV like 1 mg which has me relaxed, and feeling good. But you’ll never get that Euphoria like dope or other good opis (oxy/dilly/opana etc)",Hockey2_Surg,1514690581.0
