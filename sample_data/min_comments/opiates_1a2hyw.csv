at least in my opinion... Although I have heard the kratom tinctures can be very nice, but I have only tried the dried leaf never the concentrated tinctures..

For me PST basically eliminates all withdrawal and even gives a slight buzz all day long, whereas Kratom just tasted nasty and helped minimally with withdrawals",,1362990917.0

c8ttgac,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1a2hyw/poppy_seed_tea_vs_kratom/,t1_c8tou4x,"I strongly agree with all of this. /r/kratom has some better ideas for where to buy. I use Kratomking.com, and buy maeng da (""Pimp's kratom""). Extracts and tinctures generally cost more than they're worth. I hate the taste, so I buy powder and cap it.

Kratom hits the opiate receptors, but there's a ceiling on its effects. That's bad, becuase you can never get as high as you can with a true opiate, but it's good, because it means it's impossible to OD. (You *might* be able to OD by combining with other depressants like benzos, who knows.)

The 'buzzy/stimulating' effect is sometimes nice. In SE Asia, people chew it while they're working. Me, I like it for things like lawnmowing and yard work.",De_Quincey,1363037141.0

PST is good too, but you need to find nice unwashed ones.  Might want to check around for a guy named Tom for this.  ",Milstar,1363027342.0
