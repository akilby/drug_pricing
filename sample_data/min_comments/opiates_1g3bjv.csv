Doctors have DEA numbers for tracking how many and what kind of scripts they write that are required when filling any narcotic script and its nearly impossible to do what your friend tried doing and get away with it unless they're trying to fill something stupid like amoxicillin. Being in the business, usually pharmacists call the doctor for new patients with all narcotic scripts as they are mostly required to do so and that pharmacist is risking a lot (their pharmacist license and big fines even if they weren't in on it) filling a bogus script so they are usually pretty cautious especially depending on what kind of narcotic and how many this dumb friend of yours tried to get away with. It's possible that this pharmacist just didn't want to deal with any of the hassle that comes with this type of crime and just let your friend off on a warning but its possible that they input their information into the system and could have made a copy of the written script (and I.d. depending on how long your friend was actually in the pharmacy) if she really wanted to get them in trouble. Since she let him/her walk than it sounds like this was just a warning and your friend will be okay especially since the pharmacist is supposed to call the cops right there and then and not wait until tomorrow just because she had to pick up little Jeffrey from his soccer match. Now your friend just has a worthless stack of paper that they could try selling to some idiot if you know anyone that stupid to try this trick again",Oldshakes,1370921411.0

Her mom was an addict and worked at a doctor's office as a receptionist and supplied her daughter with the fake scripts. She got methadone and lortab probably a good 8-10 times before they got caught, and when they did get caught the cops picked up her daughter on the spot. I think your friend is OK and it was probably just a warning.",heyysuburbia,1370938834.0

That would be hilarious. Oh, and OP, I agree that your ""friends"" should be fine. But I suggest that you don't hang out with these ""friends"" of yours anymore or as much.....guilty by association is a real thing, and you can be charged with everything that your friends (hypothetically) would be charged with just for being present, or knowing about it. And also, when it comes to controlled substances, especially narcotics, I'm pretty sure every doctor has a special number that they have to write on the script, don't quote me on that though.

Also, have you guys ever thought about how many people before you have tried this? There is so many security features implemented for prescriptions......it's not like filling out a regular form.
