Back in the day, I was doing dope (heroin) pretty much every day from June 4-September 5 2017, and finally quit around that time for about a month until mid October when some stressors with my gf led me to another relapse (I legit thought she ODd and it drove me back to the needle...she ended up being alive tho) and we had been using together while she was detoxing from xanax at my house. That ended after she left and went back home...at least for me it did. Long story short, we started seeing eachother again in February and thats when I found out that she had ended up getting addicted to heroin, not just smoking trays with me while we chilled, but legit shooting up multiple times a day just as I had used to, withdrawl symptoms and everything. The whole situation really freaked me out and I have just been trying to help her get off of dope for the last couple months, thinking at first she actually wanted to quit. Turns out she didn't (now she does, but not then) and was considering doing some pretty regrettable stuff for money just to get dope so she wouldnt be sick. At that time the Zubsolvs I would give her didnt help as they didnt get her high so she wanted nothing to do with them at the time. Thinking of what I could do to help her avoid getting into the situation she was thinking about doing for money, I had weighed the costs and risks associated with it all and decided that helping her buy dope this one time would be worth the risk of my own sobriety so long as it meant she didn't get hurt again. Of course, that isnt how it played out. I still had rigs at home cause during our breakup period I would shoot meth from time to time, and still hadnt gotten rid of them. She had dope that I had paid for, so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a little taste again (this was around March 20th or so I believe) and it didnt end there. I started picking up with her and we were full-out junkie couple again, and it never really bothered me. In the meantime, I talked with my parents about getting her help, as I had talked with her, and we all came to an agreement that she would at least try getting treatment the right way with a suboxone script just as I had. Eventually I got caught, not gonna go into detail as to how, but my parents and I threw out all my parafanalia on April 17 following my last shot which I had done the night before. I haven't used again since, because I have a Zubsolv prescription that allows me to not be sick. My girl on the other hand does not, not until May 2nd at least. Shes still been using but is committed to trying to get treatment, and she called the doc to set up an appointment the other day which I am very proud of her for. Shes still using in the meantime, but I haven't smoked shot snorted or injested heroin of any kind since April 17th. However, last night we were chilling and she smoked some weed, to which I had none since I still had to drive her home. All day long she was mentioning how my pupils had been pins, to which I brushed off cause I knew such info was irrelevant at best and a little strange/sus at worst. Problem is, she also claimed I looked high, and that I never looked that way except the times when we did heroin together. On the way driving her home last night, we talked about it and the only explaination I had for why my pupils were so small was ""I honestly have no idea, theyre just kinda like that,"" which I followed up by agreeing with her suspicions about me. She ended up asking me if I was using again, telling me to just tell her if I was. Problem is, I'm not doing it! I haven't done dope in almost 10 days and thats what I told her but she refused to believe me and I admit I was acting hella guilty cause naturally I'm a terrible liar which doesnt help, especially when I'm telling the truth. I just didnt want her to think I betrayed her like that and used behind her back. I legit want help for both of us so we can move on and live a happy life without this heroin bullshit but she admittedly has been having problems trusting me lately which I deserve as I've lied to her so many times in the past. However, I dont wanna do that anymore. No more dope, no more lying, none of the shit that fucks up the best relationship I've ever had with a girl. I havent really had much time to proove this to her but its just really been bothering me that she still thinks I'm lying when I'm not. I'm stubborn as fuck and so is she so I wouldn't ever admit guilt to something I didn't do. I showed her that my tracks were gone, just scars now, no new red dots. Still didnt help. She got out of the car telling me it was my last chance to admit it or that there would be hell to pay but I still told her the truth, that I didnt use since the 17th. Honestly, idk what to do here guys, I just gotta earn her trust back but in the meantime I want to proove that I didnt use yesterday like she thinks I did so she at least knows she can trust that I'm fully committed to getting both of us clean together. This isnt about one upmanship or prooving that she was wrong to laugh in her face, I'd never do that immature bullshit. I just want her to know she can trust me on this and that I have her back.

Well, incredibly, I didn't do anything but weed for about two weeks until last night, when I took approximately 350 mgs of codeine, my usual being around 230 - 300. 

My tolerance must have really dropped, because Jesus, I was damn near falling asleep in the movie theatre when out of nowhere I was itching like never before, and boom, next thing I know I'm nauseous as shit and struggling like mad not to throw up. I'm sweating, dizzy as fuck with everything spinning, and for some strange reason, have a very intense, near unbearable pain in my pelvis. Inconveniently, the drug was also numbing said pain to the point where, despite being extremely (ergo, too) aware of its existence, I had no way of figuring out what sort of pain it actually was.

Somehow I managed to sit through till the end of the movie restless as fuck, and as soon as that was over I stood up and, to my shock, successfully made my way over to the bathroom.

So I'm in this stall with the same horrible symptoms, and man, I swear I thought I was meeting my maker. Tried to take a piss to get rid of the pelvic pain, didn't help. Literally started stripping and all right then and there in an attempt to cool myself and not fucking faint. I was having a hard time breathing, my chest felt suppressed and I felt like I could barely function.

The cinema was closing so I had to leave, and fuckin hell, even though the fresh air definitely did feel good, staggering around in await of my drive was fucking hard. It was like being drunk, just worse, because I felt even more unaware and disconnected from the world. Everything was just a darn mess. I remember my eyes being real red when I looked in the mirror.

Thankfully, I started feeling better soon, and all this likely lasted about thirty to forty five minutes. Gotta say though, I was still high as fuck six hours after dosing, and it took me about 18 hours to fully get sober. I've barely gotten up all day today, threw up a little too and still pretty nauseous, just very weak.

Just gonna point out, I know panic attacks quite well, and this, well I can tell ya mates it wasn't one.

Any thoughts on what the fuck happened here? Personal experiences? Much thanks.

Had almost 2 years off of this junk and fell victim to it once again. It's sick how your mind will still continue to play tricks on you even after being away from opiates for so long.

I got into a new career where I had an opportunity to make basically as much money as I wanted (sales) that I was actually good at. After a bad day, I decided to get high. I mean i deserved it, right? I was making more money, had a good bit saved to put towards a house,  and most importantly it had been almost 2 fucking years -- I earned this dope. I decided to ""reward"" myself; what better way to feel better on a bad day?

This was only about 2 and a half months ago. In that short span I've lost just about everything I earned in my sobriety. My savings is damn near gone, no job, and back at home (thankfully I could come back here). I'm thankful that I have a mother who is willing to support me and try to help any way she can and I have my fiance who will do the same but this fucking shit has taken me over mentally once again. I can't get past the 48 hour mark. I'm trying with kratom, weed, and some beer but once I get to day 2 I'm mentally fucked. I always cave and cop. I even AMA'd out a detox and copped. That was a week ago and I've made it to day 2 twice since but again, I cave. 

What I thought was going to be easy kick is turning out to be a nightmare. Hoping on some subs today to hopefully make it easier but that's still in the air as of now. Now I'm stuck with the thought of ""Am I really even ready?"" I haven't gone back to banging it yet but I can feel the urge getting stronger and stronger for it every day. If I continue down this path I'm going to lose my fiance and the few things I have left, but that's the terrifying part; it still makes me unsure if I'm ready to stop. It's terrifying how strong of a grip this drug has on your mind.

There's really no point to my post other than to just put it out there in hopes I'll feel some kind of relief or some fucking moment of clarity bullshit.

So, the week of 4/20, I took about 25 mg of some 5/325 hydros one day, stupidly enough took another 20mg on the Friday of 4/20, drank a bit of alcohol, and that was that. That night I was nauseous as a motherf*cker, and definitely learned my lesson. 

Over the next couple days, I noticed I was a bit out of it, *lack of an appetite*, and continued to get more *anxious* and *depressed* as the week progressed. 

Come Tuesday night, a bit sleep deprived from the previous day, I was sitting down eating dinner. **Then all hell broke loose**, I suddenly got cold sweats, hyper ventilated to the point of passing out, vertigo to the point where I couldn't walk/stand and had an insane blood pressure reading for someone my age.

Ended up going to the ER, where I was given some nausea meds, and some stuff for vertigo, as they had no idea what was going on.

Someone did mention to me, that I may be going through withdrawls? Is that even possible with a weekend of heavy use?

I'd love to hear some insight!

I usually use dope but recently I found a new plug in my area (I was previously driving more than an hour each way to pick up dope because I didn’t have a plug anywhere near me).

The only thing is, this new plug of mine only has oxy, not dope. And seeing as I’m not too familiar with roxy and am always paranoid about fake pills I was wondering if you all would be so kind as to help me identify if these are real or fake.

The lighting was a little bit difficult to get right so I took multiple pictures of the front and back as well as one of the side of one of the pills.

**Please note that although it may look like some of the markings are very light, it’s just the camera lighting.** Also there are some little bluish specks throughout each of the pills in case you can’t see (which I believe are supposed to be there, so I think that’s a good sign). Finally, you may notice a crack in the side of the pill that I took a picture of. It didn’t come like that, that happened by accident after it was purchased.

Thank you very much!!

I can truly state that more than any other substance opioids amplify the experience of cigarettes for me. They are 50x better.

But now that I've been getting sober (and this isn't new, as every time I would withdraw for a few days in my cycles the same thing occurred); I literally haven't smoked a single cigarette. I noticed that when my dependence was increasing, withdrawals in my weekly binge cycle were getting worse, that I wasn't smoking anymore on rebound/off days. But I would smoke like a chimney when high.

I didn't attribute this to anything other than feeling like shit, but over time the result was that I didn't touch nicotine when I was rebounding. It just wasn't enjoyable. And it still isn't! Compared to the smooth, wholesome experience of cigarettes on opioids; smoking them sober is coarse, acrid and irritating.

I literally have zero drive to go get cigarettes. It's just lost its appeal.

I’ve been a long time lurker here in this subreddit and I love how there is zero judgement and how you take care of each other!

I live in Germany and work in a homeless shelter, so from time to time I have contact with opiates users. Two years ago I read an article in the newspapers about the whole opiate crisis in the US and how it is killing so many people. I mean I was familiar with the fact that people die from opiate abuse but in Germany there aren’t so many as we have different programs to help people and most importantly health insurance. So the whole getting hooked on Oxy or other pain meds isn’t really common. If you have pain mostly you get offered other medical help or get ibuprofen. ANYWAY. 

I’m in the US right now for vacation and have been traveling mostly in Cali, but I’ve been to Arizona too. It’s my second time in the US and last time I’ve been here in 2013 I noticed homeless people and drug using people, but this time it shocked me. 
I just find it find it mind blowing ( in a bad meaning) that there are so many people suffering and there seems to be so little help for those people in need. I mean I’m used to the German “standards” but back there it is already infuriating for me how little the government does for the people and how being homeless makes you ill (psychically and mentally). It seems like here it is even worse and people going crazy on the streets. Today I saw a women on the bus injecting herself in the foot and she couldn’t find a vein for some time and the bus going fast and then stopping again and so on. I felt her pain even though I never tried opiates but because I’ve seen it here and at work. 

So you are probably wondering what the point of this post is. Well, it’s kind of a deep question and you probably can’t answer it in one second but are there programs (needle exchange, free
Meds for HIV/Hep C, assisted living etc.) which help people in need and can you actually get off the streets? 

Thanks for reading!

Stay safe and stay strong!

I know karma is real and it will catch up with my manager and how terrible of a person she is, but fuck it hurts. 

Unfortunately for me I don’t have a savings, I have a decent amount of debt that I was paying off. I had a budget planned, just picked up a ton of overtime so by the end of the year I would have been debt free and able to start saving and finish my degree so I can start applying for medical school. I have a bunch of medical procedures I was budgeting to save for including dental work costing about 5k to fix fillings in my teeth that came out in the front.

I know I can’t afford to pay for classes with this check I’ll get paid tomorrow because I need to save it and stretch it out as long as possible. 

My car was paid for in full and that’s about the only thing I have to my name. Along with a bunch of debt.



I’m ashamed, this isn’t exactly my fault. There was miscommunications with my fmla company and my employer.

Nothing comes out so I get up and leave the bathroom with a disappointed feeling because I just want it to get over with. I walk around a bit trying to get things move faster but the only thing it does it create more stomach cramps.


Then after doing a few more push tests on the toilet throughout the day, it is finally ready to come out.

I don't know for sure if it reduces tolerance, it's said to help prevent it from rising as you're taking it but i guess it can't hurt, chelated magnesium.

so yea, 83% is excreted through urine so the more you pee the more you you get out of your system and exercise/cardio in general makes your body more efficient so it'll speed things up with keeping a decent healthy diet.

So when i was able to get my hands on a bunch of oxycodone tablets i was obviously thrilled for my first real experience with opiates as this class of chemicals is depicted as pure joy.
offcourse i started slowly, taking a normal recreational dose on an empty stomach and as i felt the effects come on my dissapointment started to grow.

after an hour with tiny pupils but not much else i thought:""maybe at an higher dose i'll feel it"".
however as i snorted myself to a dose that would put most people in a coma i still felt nothing except for an intense itch.
at that moment i gave up on oxy's and convinced myself that it just wasnt strong enough for me.

so after a few years i got my hands on some H that i would try with a friend,this should be the best feeling ever right?
after a couple of lines we both started to feel it. He was in intense bliss and i was just extremely itchy and a bit tired. as the evening went on we both redosed a couple off times, at the end i took about tripple as much as him but i still never really felt it.

to be sure it did actually worked we both tested our bp and heartrate and counted how fast the other was breathing and while this changed with my friend, mine stayed virtually the same.
i also tried a small pain test by pinching myself and my friend, and while there was no change in my pain perception he couldnt feel anything.

so here's my question, why dont opiates like me? 
also, unrelated question, is showering with H nice?

Smoking it on foil doesn't work very well for me. The high is lackluster and I feel like I waste quite a bit:

I need 70-200mg to get high depending on quality. Smoking 100mg+ of heroin takes me *forever* and this results in a shitty high. For those that don't know, with smoking you don't get the whole dose at once, you put it on foil and chase it around with a lighter and inhale the fumes through a tube. One run on the foil gets me like 5-15mg or so, and then there is like 30 seconds while I exhale/inhale before the next run. So I end up getting the whole 100mg dose into me 5-15mg at a time, over the course of like 30-60 minutes, instead of getting the whole thing at once like I do with snorting. As a result the high kinda sucks. I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or something. A lot of people tell me smoking is awesome because you sort of get a rush -- how is this even possible when you consume your dose one tiny inhalation at a time?

I also find it impossible to find a tube of the right size to use, and because of this I often end up missing a good amount of the smoke. I've tried regular drinking straws, really thick drinking straws, pens, and tubes of foil. The foil never works as it always collapses inward while inhaling, and the pens/straws are either too thick or too narrow.

So... I've thought about going into town and picking up one of those ""meth"" pipes that look like:

I'm not sure what to do, these withdrawals are so much worse than any H withdrawal I've ever experianced. Does anybody have any idea on what to do to help, I'm getting ready to take 20 more rn, I don't know what else to do. I can't relapse and get dope again.

It's been a fucking miracle for me.,"Was prescribed Omeprazole for a stomach condition. I took my first dose of it (20 mg) about an hour before my last dose of H before deciding to kick opiates for a while. Omeprazole's not a very interesting drug by itself, but in combination with *our favorites* such as Opiates & Benzos it has an effect of inhibiting the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, meaning drugs such as opiates & benzos stay in the blood stream longer (and possibly reach higher concentrations).

Here's what our good old friend Wikipedia says about it:

>Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram,[33] warfarin,[34] *oxycodone*, *tramadol*, and *oxymorphone*. The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with omeprazole.

I thought *nice score*! When I read that (the other common antacid used in this method is Cimetidine (an antacid and antihistamine on its own; and is often mentioned in opiate-potentiation guides).

So back to my withdrawal story. I had gone through a decent withdrawal about three or four weeks back. It **sucked**. However, I'm nearing the 72 hour mark now and I've only had one bout of diarrhea. The muscle aches aren't as intense, emotionally I'm a bit sensitive, but this is a walk in the park compared to last time.

Does anyone have any thoughts on if Omeprazole is what made this so easy? If so, it should be in every opiate addicts cabinet!",1524641854.0

I say I won't have cash till tomorrow when I work and I'm expecting him to say they're on me. He doesn't he just says hit me up tomorrow. 

At this point I'm pissed so I straight up ask if he's gonna get his money back so I can get something cuz I'm pissed af that im out $175.

I had been using heroin for almost 2 years. I made it to the bus stop, though I wasn't really sure where I was going. I knew that the next day I was going to get to the hospital to detox. At the bus stop it was getting dark and I was on the lookout for any users. I had about $50 or so on me from my boss that paid me under the table. 

On the corner there was a Happy's pizza. Across the street was a liquor store. I offered to buy a man a beer if he paid for them, as I was still underage. It was successful and we drank as we waited for the bus. There was trash around the bus stop. Everyone was hot and mad because the bus was late. I saw a lady approaching, asking people for money to get something to eat. When she got to me, she asked if I could help her get a couple dollars for some french fries or something. Looking around, I knew that she didn't want fries, and there wasn't really a place to get any. I asked her if she was looking for french fries or did she want something else? Immediately she switched up and with a smile on her face she knew exactly what I meant. 

We left the bus stop and she led me to a house where we could cop. Times like this made it hard to want to stop but I knew I had a problem. We waited for her dude to get home and went inside. I bought 40 worth of beautiful light tan powder dope. I bought some for the lady and she loaded her rig and was trying to shoot in her leg. Damn, I didn't want to be like that. I could still hit in my arm, though at times it wasn't easy. 

After staying there for a little while, I thanked them and went on my way. I was high and still had a little money in my pocket. It was hot and humid, the beginning of my third summer on heroin. I made it to another bus stop in front of a white building. There was a small wall of a flower bed to sit on. I grabbed my dope, rig, and water. I prepped a shot and it was hard to shoot in the dark. Mosquitoes kept landing on me, making it hard to focus. A man rode up to me at the bus stop, and I tried to hide what I was doing. Turns out he didn't really care, he was a fiend himself, named Terry. He helped with light and keeping the mosquitoes away until I could finally register and push. It felt good to have the amount of dope I had on me.

We started talking and he offered to pay for sex. I was already high with dope in my pocket, but I accepted. There was no place for us to do it, so we crossed the street to the neighborhood, and chose a spot in between two houses. It was dark enough, so the whoever was inside these brick homes probably would never know. We finished and i wondered when the bus would be on the way. Terry said I didn't have to worry about it, and that I could just stay at his place for the night. 

I hopped on the front of his bike and off we went to his house. We rode through the neighborhood under the streetlights. He taught me to lean with our turns. I was surprised that he could ride so well with my weight added. We arrived at his place, a corner house. He introduced me to his roommate and we went upstairs to his room. I prepped another shot before bed and lied down to sleep with the stranger I met an hour ago. He was nice to me.",1524620462.0

What should I do?,"So my old heroin dealer got really inconsistent so I got a new hook up. At first, it started off great. He had good stuff and really nice sacks. It was a little more than my other guy but I was fine with that. So as time as gone on it seems like the sacks have gotten smaller. I got 3 G’s the other day and it was small enough I decided to go get a scale. So I got 2 G’s today, got home and it weighed out to 1.5. I wouldn’t even have tripped if it was 1.8 or something but .5 is a big difference. What would y’all do? I’m thinking about waiting until I go next time and then being like hey have you calibrated your scale lately Bc that last sack came up 1.5. I figured I’d bring it up as if he made an honest mistake instead of just calling him out. I just don’t want him to cut me off. At least until I can find another hook up. What do y’all think?

Update: Thanks for all the advice. Everyone had good things to say. I worked 12 hours today so I decided to wait until tomorrow since I’m off. I’m gonna text him in the morning and see what he says. Hopefully he offers to give me the other .5 and it’s good from now on. I will get on here and put another update tomorrow and let y’all know what happened. Honestly he’s dumb enough to deny it and say it was 2 even though he knows what he weighed out and I’m gonna call him out on it. Tbh as long as he keeps serving me and it’s the correct weight from now on I don’t even care about the .5 but if he’s cool he will give it to me. Bc he’s been doing this for the past month or so. Like I said, when I first started going to him the sacks were legit. I got 3 G’s the first few times and it was huge. So he shouldn’t have a problem giving me what I pay for. Like y’all said, he’s probably just doing it Bc he thinks he can get away with it. I doubt he turns down my money from now on Bc I spend quite a bit on this crap. We shall see. Will update y’all. 

Update #2: I texted him and asked if he had calibrated his scale lately and said sometimes if you don’t calibrate it every now and then it can get off a little bit. And then I said or I figured you might have picked up the wrong sack. He texted back and said probably so but I got you.

My side of the story.,"First, I want to start by saying that I have never consumed any type of drugs in my entire life. (dont worry, I did not come here to preach, much less I'm going to ask you to stop using, I respect you and your decisions) but wanted to tell you a bit about myself and how this subreddit change my perception of the world.

A few months ago, by mere chance I found this subrredit and felt incredibly curious. While browsing stories and memes I found myself laughing and crying from situations I couldnt relate and that I hardly understood which baffled me.

You have to know that I come from a country that has suffered unceasingly due to drug trafficking. I bet if I told you the name, you would immediately associate it with drug trafficking (No, it's not mexico lol.)

When I was little my father was a prominent farmer, and for many years he was approached by narco-terrorist groups that wanted to ""buy"" his land to plant poppy and coca. They also planned to set up labs to manufacture many types of drugs including heroin. 

My father that had some massive balls refused their offer. This was a very brave but not very smart move and resulted in multiple muerder attempts. Things finally got so bad that we were forced to move across the country and loose almost everything we had. 

Since that day I hated drugs with all my heart, but for some reason I blamed users more than I blamed narcos. In my mind, consumers were the reason why all of this was happening  to me and I blamed you for years. 

But against all odds, after reading some amazing stories and some very sad ones I felt the struggle and understood the many reasons that drive people to addiction and suddenly I could relate, and felt sympathy...

So even if this subrredit for you its just a safe space to share your experiences and laugh a little. For me its a very humane, tolerant and warm community full of amazing people just dealing with life the best they can. You showed me another perspective I've never considered before and helped me overcome my judgemental mindset.

Sometimes there is no wrong or right or better or worse or black and white. Finally we are all just people trying to find happiness in this shitty world.  

So from the bottom of my heart thank you. Be safe. ",1524580210.0

I sent my sub doctor a picture of my face and x-rays, and she said to take WHATEVER I needed to help with the pain, and if whatever the ER gave me wasn't strong enough she'd give me something else.

So I was prescribed 30mg codeine pills. 2 pills 4 times a day. 

Today I called the doctor and said they weren’t working and he told me it is safe to double my dose. So I’m on 12 pills a day which will make my supply run out quicker (which was my intention. The supply only lasts me 2 days in reality) 

So I have 3-4 days left until I can go back but I was wondering if anyone thinks it’s a good idea to request the 60mg tablets after being told I can double the dose if the pain is still unbearable.

Tell me what to do!,"Soooooo...(settle in, kinda long) I helped out a friend that lost their job very unexpectedly and unfairly, having nothing whatsoever to do with their heroin habit. I know what happens when u lose a job as a junkie and no savings to cover ur daily habit, you go downhill fast and finding and keeping a new job is nearly fucking impossible. So I agreed to take care of them while they looked for a new job and started having money coming back in. They got a holiday job quickly and after that a permanent job immediately, both jobs well paying. Their current job pays $16- $17 an hour and is full-time. Their living expenses are minimal, no rent, no kids, no SO, but car needs a lot of upkeep. 
     Well, as I'm sure u have guessed, their bill has sky rocketed and they are less than diligent paying me back. I even charge them the lowest amount possible for the work they get. I should mention that on the scale of friends from 1 to 10, 10 being like damn near family, lifelong homie, help hide a body for each other friend, this person was about a 4-5 when I started helping them out. Not sure where they currently fall on the scale. We've stayed in constant communication, at one point I tallied up their bill, gave them another big discount and a reasonable payment deadline, they agreed to all of it but ultimately only repaid 70% of what they should have. Currently they owe a few thousand, we don't have a payment schedule in place, just a lot of talk about needing to get it taken care of, start lowering the bill and start lowering their usage level, lots of talk but no real action.
     Here's the problem, throughout this entire time they have kept up an active social life, no problem, I didn't expect or want them to become a hermit. However I recently got wind of an upcoming trip to a tropical location, a mutual friend informed me but they didn't know exactly when this trip was happening. So tonight, when I saw them for their daily dose, they gave me some story about a last minute, out of town trip for a family medical situation (non-emergency). They will be gone from tomorrow afternoon until Thursday, maybe Friday and could I give them in one chunk what they would normally get over all those days? Now I know they have told me stories and lies to justify why they haven't paid me more, problems with their paycheck, unexpected car issues etc...the normal junkie Bullshit but a straight up, only for fun, tropical vacation that they don't even tell me honestly about, really pissed me off. So now I gotta decide if this so-called family medical trip is for real or just another lie. Do I keep helping or leave them high and fucking dry? What would you guys do? I'm not hurting for money at the moment, but I don't like paying for other people's habits and I really fucking hate it when people think they are getting away with something when in fact I know what's up but choose not to confront them with it.

I just played one when I was a junkie.,"We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

“Now baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I’m not actually a doctor.”

“Shut up!  It’s not funny!  Now hurry up!”

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

“Now, we have to squeeze it.”  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn’t make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

“Okay.  That should be good.”  We wrapped the wound in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to the strip club where she had worked a couple of years before. After 15 minutes of my waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So, we headed back to the town we met in.

I wasn’t afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about that town, it was that no one’s word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I’m not saying that they weren’t dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

I've been on it now for the second time. I've been on it since January now and love the fact that I have a good job, can save money, can be trusted by my family more, and still be able to dabble with my blues once every month or two and get right back on track..

The only thing is that it has a huge impact on my lifting. When I was clean and not taking any subs, I weighed around 215, was decently big, and able to put up some weight (was repping 225 on bench pretty easily.) I now weigh around 195 and am noticeably smaller. I tried doing chest today and was struggling with 135 on the bar and could barely put up 155. I just got so disappointed and frustrated I gave up and left. 

Are there any tips any of you have for getting weight back up? I know my appetite has a huge impact on this as I have to force myself to eat sometimes because I'm never hungry. I could eat only a decent sized lunch and be all set with food for the entire day.

Been on the rocks lately and wondering should I explode.,Ok everyone. Me and my boyfriend where like best friends back in 2013. We started shooting up and thing turned into a bromance and than dating. I would suck his dick at night but he wanted to keep it in the down low but things where becoming transparent. Well I talked to one of my old trap buddy not to long ago and he brought up the time we all where sitting in a car. And one of my other friends named Sam texted my Kevin (boyfriend) said hey come pick me up and smoke a blunt and like me also suck that dick. Got into a big fight with sam and we all got over it. But I would get mad at Kevin for hanging out with him alone. Now Sam had all the plugs to the dope and the excuse was always like I was getting dope. Than my birthday rolled again last week and I basically broke up with Kevin. Long stupid story. I talked to my old trap buddy about it and he said he was always sneaky. I asked him what he meant by all of this. He said a couple of years ago when I was away at rehab. My buddy was at a friends house and Kevin texted his friend and said he wanted to give him head and also sent a dick pic. But my friend said it seemed like it was meant for someone else. Now I’ve always had a feeling that Kevin was cheating on me a couple of times but I couldn’t prove it. Now I’m trying to get in contact with this Zack kid and figure it out. This will be some dead to right type evidence. Hopefully he remember this shit. But what should I do. Kevin will eventuallycome back to me and should I bring it up?

Do I just hold it for like half an hour and then take the patch off so that the rest wouldn't be released? I'm a bit confused.

I have used opiates before, but nothing major. Just codeine, tramadol, kratom. Is there a safe way to use these patches at all, or should I forget about it altogether? 

Edit: I read up on these patches and concluded that it is a super idiotic idea. I won't do them. I really wonder how did they end up at my place since none of my parents have any chronic pain or whatever... My stepdad has some back problems but they're definitely nowhere near as bad that he would be taking this shit. I'm puzzled to be honest.

So I havn't been muslim all my life, just more recently (shit gets weird when your immediate family is 1/2  arab 1/2 latino growing up, so I got 1/2 Christian 1/2 Muslim lol). I'd say like 4-5 years.


My question is how do you deal our obligations? Like prayer x times a day (I know the answer to that, probably the same as mind, you'd like to do it more, but you just don't for x reason), Friday prayer, and Ramadan (as it's approaching).


On methadone it was simple, get to the clinic at 4 AM, wait an hour till 5 when they opened, dose within 4 minutes to avoid doing after Fajr.  And I only smoked bud at night.

I plan to not use at all that month, as I'm planning another break (I tend to use for 2 months, break for 2, repeat), but I'm curious how a stronger user would cope all day? 

So, I'm curious, are you like me, who will absolutly not step foot inside a Masjid if I'm high? I've gone to jummah sick as a dog, and then copped. I just feel it horribly disrespectful to do so high, but that's just my opinion.

IMO religion is a relationship between you and God, so there are no right or wrong answers, I'm just curious what bros/sis take on this, since I can't ask anyone at the masjid....


""Salam Imam! Is it permissible to shoot heroin before Jummah? or is it haram?!""

I just got some ER Targin. 10mg Oxycodone and x amount Naloxone. Crushed and parachuted 30mg. I expected to puke due to little if any tolerance. so I sat down. For the first hour, total euphoria! No discomfort whatsoever. And then.. it happened. I was sitting there, and every 10 seconds my head would start to fall to one side, and the sound of my jacket rubbing would snap me back into consciousness. 10 seconds later, same thing. Total bliss! For a moment I was worried I’d had too much, and that I should avoid sleep at all costs.. but that’s just because I’ve never experienced this before. 20 minutes in, and each ‘sleep’ started to last a bit longer, maybe 10 seconds. Each with a different ‘dream’. I was dreaming, but I was awake, but I wasn’t.. then I’d snap out of it, drift off again, and have a different dream. Throughout this, my entire body is so warm. Emotionally, I feel fantastic. Worry free. Just.. perfectly content. (Is this actually what’s referred to as nodding?)

Overall, 10/10 experience. Would take this over meth any day of the week. 

Part of me wants to flush the rest.. because I already know if I keep going I’ll end up hooked. 

Side question: how does H, specifically #4, compare to oxycodone?

So all I’ve been able to find lately is shitty ass scramble. This shit burns the hell out of my nose and barely gets me high.

Yesterday I met up with a dealer that I got from waiting in a parking lot for another dealer... lol.

He’s been selling me ‘uncut’ rocks. Obviously they’re cut to some extent, but he just doesn’t cut it himself again into shitty ass scramble with tons of Benadryl or whatever it is.

So he made me come all the way through yesterday and wait a while only to admit he doesn’t have any on him. 

Started to sketch me out when him and his friend (I barely know either) jumped into my whip and told me to drive to get it.

When we got down the street, he asked to use my phone and called like 3 of his hookups.

Finally a dude answered and was surprisingly right down the street. He pulled up in literally 5 seconds.

I could tell immediately when I looked at this dude that he was older and has been in the game for a while. I knew that this is who all the small-time dealers were copping from before they cut their shit.

I was overcharged baaaad. Sold me 4 points for like 75 bucks :/
The shit was greeeeat though.

Buuuut today I realized the number was left in my phone. And another post gave me courage to just call him and say I got from him yesterday.  I didn’t want him to tell my other guy that I was being sketchy.

But it was a success... and of course he’ll sell that same great shit for a much cheaper price.

Finally got a good hookup close by :’)

So funny how this happened... met him through having met four other dealers randomly while waiting in parking lots / calling numbers left in my phone.

Cheers guys! This stuff is nice, light tan rocks for $15 a point. Usually prices here are like $10 a tenth instead but this stuff is waaaaay better and I don’t mind paying it.

Super stoked (•‿•)

Called the number one of my dealers left in my phone. Now I have a hookup to the good dope before it’s cut again!",1524495992.0

I've browsed through the sub quite a bit looking for answers, and gotten quite a bit of information, but I'd love to get an up to date response a little more tailored to my situation if at all possible.

So here's what's going on - 
Ive been informed by my work that I've got a mouth swab that has to be taken. I could have taken it last Friday, but they gave me the option of that or sometime this coming week, so naturally I chose the latter. Now, I smoke pot daily, and sniff h daily. About .2-.4 per day. Stopping smoking weed for a week won't be a problem, but that's not the one I'm worried about. 

My question to all of you is: 
How can I pass this test while being uncomfortable for the shortest possible time frame? If I need to take Kratom or Lope or some other withdrawal lessening substance, I'm more than open to suggestions. Wasn't able to acquire any subs. I have on hand Gabapentin and trazadone as well, don't think those will show up on the test.

 I have to swab my my mouth and then leave the swab in for five minutes. The swab will then be sent to a lab. So basically, I want tips regarding all stages and aspects of this. 

Tldr: swab test this week. When should I take it, what should I abstain from and for how long, and how can I suffer as little as possible from withdrawals while still passing.

A few months ago I splurged $25 and bought a gram of an opioid known as methoxyacetylfentanyl, or MAF. This drug produces a deliciously warm five hour buzz. It's also exceptionally potent - just one tenth of a milligram is equivalent to a few bags of street heroin, and there are one thousand milligrams in one gram.  

For the mathematically impaired among us, that's ten thousand strong doses, enough to get a solid nod every evening for a decade.  

So naturally, I used all ten thousand doses within three months and then went into a horrific withdrawal.  

Or did I? Well, I did go into a horrific withdrawal, but what about the MAF being gone? Oh, I definitely poured the last of the crystal residue from the baggie and made quick work of it, that's unquestionable. But there must have been a hundred invisible doses stuck to the sides of the baggie and I can't recall any bag-scraping for the life of me. Try as I might, I cannot dredge up the memory of doing anything with that 'empty' bag. Surely I didn't throw it away?  

It's almost midnight at the moment so I can hardly tear up my room trying to find this baggie, but tomorrow morning I'm going to flip everything upside down and get to the bottom of this mystery.

One of the topics that stand out to me surrounds how, as laws are tightened, legislation written into law, the chronic pain patient, the very person these drugs are aimed at helping are increasingly being denied their medication. Either that, or made to jump through countless hoops in order to secure the medication they are rightly entitled to.

I can only read articles and watch documentaries. I have no first or second hand knowledge on this topic. Could I ask my fellow Redditor‘s across the pond; is this actually a big problem in the US?

My first post over in this sub. As the title says, my BF of 2 months told me last week that he's been moderately addicted to oxycodone for the past 8 months following a very harrowing near-death experience that almost cost him his life and he was prescribed them for pain management.

He's been buying them off the street. This in itself terrifies me. 

We had a few troubles in our relationship and when I called him out about it, he got really reactive and we didn't speak for 2 weeks. He confessed his addiction to me on this past Thursday, and I was floored. Like, floored. I had no idea. I've never been involved with someone who was addicted to anything other than booze or pot (not sheltered, just careful) and looking back, I realized that it explained a lot of his behaviours.  He has told me that he hasn't used since the day we broke up, because he was ashamed of the way he'd been acting and how much he hurt me.

My question to you is this: What are some of the typical ""signs"" of oxy use that I should be on the lookout for in case he slips or was just plain lying to me? Everything I've read online was very generalized, i.e. ""mood swings"". This is a strange situation for me since he has been high every time I've seen him. I don't know what his ""normal"" self is like without the oxy.

I did read a bit about the aftermath of getting off it, and yeah, those symptoms sound a lot like what he was going through when I saw him on Saturday.  He was wrecked but looked better than I've seen him. He was in good spirits, if a bit distracted. His belly wasn't happy with him and he was sick a few times. He hasn't been sleeping well and would alternate between being very hot to shivering, covered in goosebumps. He didn't have any flu or anything; I am sure it was his body freaking the fuck out from not having his fix.

Any advice or help you could give would mean a lot to me. I just want to help him get better, and it says a lot to me that I was the catalyst for his change. He's not doing it FOR me; he's doing it BECAUSE of me.",1524480475.0

I was invited by some old classmates to barbecue at their place last weekend. I was surprised and decided to go since it was a welcome distraction from just studying for my finals and shooting, without much social interaction.





When we all sat together the conversation turned to the recent death of that DJ guy, aviici. So they started joking about how heroin was healthier than alcohol and that he might be alive if he had opted for heroin instead of alcohol. Not factually wrong, but I bet you know those jokes along the lines of 'haha, it's funny to say heroin because it's so absurd to shoot heroin'. They went on for while like 'oh, yeah, you could shoot some heroin, it's not that bad, lololol'. I felt super uncomfortable and when I left I couldn't really pinpoint why I felt *so* uncomfortable. Tbh I got a little paranoid and thought they were laughing at me tho they don't even know I use. They know I used to have a drug problem when I was younger bc I came straight from an inpatient treatment when I was added to the class. 



Being brutally honest, my thought process was even weirder. I had a best girlfriend in that class who had the bad habit of sleeping with/going after guys I was involved with. Because she was comfy around them after I introduced them (her reasoning lol). After she spread her legs for my just-ex and lying to me about it, things went really sour and I plunged into the worst depression of my adult life. They still are together, I think. Also some other stuff happened that made shit worse for me. I may or may not have threatened to maybe overdose because she had been a bad fwiend. Yes, super cringe. And I thought, maybe she told them I was using dope and they invited me to verify that. How fucking stupid can I be? Why does my brain work like that? 




So instead of figuring out these insecurities by myself and questioning my sick social paranoia, I texted one of the guys I used to be close friends with in school and *asked why I was invited*. I cringe so hard just saying this. Like, what if he asked why I would even say that? Should I say that I couldn't imagine anyone inviting me and spending time with me voluntarily without an ulterior motive? That I think it intuitively more likely that people hate me and want to ridicule me? Argh! What did I even expect when I wrote this? I don't know, I can't stop thinking about it. And I wish I could say something to take away the weirdness of the question. But there really isn't anything that would make me look any less weird and stupid. (If you have an idea though, I'd be eternally grateful.) 




Do you know that social paranoia? Always thinking 'THEY KNOW!' and in turn acting super irrationally? And even without thinking they know I'm a user - social interaction gets always super weird for me. 





Just kill me please. I don't know man, every time I try to rebuild my social life I get so freaking paranoid and fuck shit up because I feel so uncomfortable being me that I can't imagine anyone liking to be around me.





If I didn't have some dope atm to keep me calm I know would fuck up my exams too. So, praise Junkie Jesus my mom lend me some money to balance my credit card. Praise the Lord for poppies, because without, if not I, the cringe would fucking kill me. 


Hope the fam is safe and well.




TLDR: I asked someone why they did invite me because I'm an absolute socially handicapped idiot. And thanks for heroins, because if not for heroins the cringe at myself would kill me. ",1524468022.0

Overall though I don't think it matters how much medication I do or do not have, I'm still gonna be in pain. I just wont be in pain AND withdrawals now.

8e98qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8e98qq/doctors_refusing_to_prescribe_naloxone/,19,https://redd.it/8e98qq,BadBrent,Doctors REFUSING to prescribe naloxone!??!,"TL;DR - I'm a Suboxone patient living around people who despise the fact that I require a medication to get me to a point where I can seek therapy and battle the disease of addiction.  Multiple people (even including doctors) have said ""you don't need naloxone...if you did they wouldn't even put it in your medication in the first place.""  Even after explaining naloxone does NOTHING orally/bucally their mentality is that I have all the naloxone I need in pill form and if that's not enough then I shouldn't be on Suboxone in the first place.  I even have the mindset that both people and doctors are absolute and utter f*cking morons when it comes to helping to save a life just because they are completely in the dark or have no care when it comes to people in my predicament.  My primary doctor will not write the prescription, my emergency dept. won't, and the only way to obtain naloxone is by walking into a pharmacy and slapping down $170 for a SINGLE DOSE KIT.  Why should we have to pay that much for one dosage when a single vial and sterile needle costs 1/20th of that?

I've searched for over a month trying to get my hands on one or two naloxone vials as I already have my sharps (I also am on test for medicinal purposes and never inject a single milligram more than I'm allowed - nor do I have the desire).  I've went to the county clinic trying to obtain a single prescription and they refuse to budge on the grounds that ""there are people that need naloxone much worse than you do"" solely because I'm already in recovery and I'm the only person that matters because I've been able to get this far in life in spite of my addictions.  I already know with a prescription, my health insurance, and/or GoodRx I can purchase two 2mg vials for less than $20 out the door and if it means saving mine or someone else's life then I gladly pay it - getting my hands on the vials/amps are a different story however.

Are there resources available that would perhaps allow someone with a preexisting addiction receive a prescription for naloxone, even if every pharmacy in our area will sell naloxone OTC for $170 for a single dose?  I've called my town hall, been to city meetings, and done everything I know how to do and haven't been able to find someone that would be able to help and I can't jeopardize my own integrity just to ""cop some naloxone.""  If there are some ideas others have used before to get a prescription for it, consider me all ears because I've experienced first (and second) hand what this antidote can do for people about to overdose.  You'd think being in the heartland of opiate addiction a plea for help would be heard with open ears but there aren't many people advocating for myself or the others in my area so I feel like it has to start somewhere.  Any ideas, tips, or recommendations would be highly welcome.  Thank you very much.",1524462416.0

Bupe, Subutex, Methadone, etc. I'm going to the intake appointment and I'm going to tell them my history and current use.

I've talked to a few people and they told me to confide in the docs and counselors to find the best treatment  I don't want Methadone, so I'm gong to shoot for a Sub taper. However, I've NEVER been to a maintenance or treatment clinic, so I'm going to go over any options with the doc.

I can't fucking keep taking so much Hydro. The APAP is toxic as shit and I don't know anyone that has a better alternative. So, I'm going to a clinic to a doc that can help before I completely fuck my liver. I can deal with being a junkie per se, but I'm worried about my health. Specifically my liver. I have a good job and I'm able to function at it 100% and I'm able to pay all of my bills.

So, while I still have my life on track, I'm seeking help. I'm still staying in this community on this sub, but I'll be on a healthier alternative that doesn't have 3-4g of APAP included.

Sublingual ROA is by far my preference. I'm torn between sublingual and buccal. I humbly consider myself a pro as far as the technique but I'm never above advice.  I recently started heating the patch under a lighter just before administering under the tongue. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE AN INSANE TOLERANCE!! I got to the point of 100mcg patches not satisfying my thirst. This technique will knock your socks off, trust me. The first time I did it I thought I was toast. I want to hear you guys' personal techniques and tips, maybe I can pick up on something.

If you do decide, which I DO NOT CONDONE, be very cognizant of the following:

Pull up the hard plastic film (touch the sticky side as little as possible) and grab it on the very tip of one of the corners with a pair of tweezers. Remove it completely from the plastic, turn the patch horizontally with the sticky side up (facing the ceiling) and start about a foot over the flame. Once you notice the heat causing the patch to rise and flutter hold it still. The sticky side will start to glaze over and seem wet. Be super careful! Angle your eye to where you can see the flame through the patch so you can monitor the texture. If you notice the patch start to go transparent from the outer edge inward STOP. This is a no-no, you're too close to the flame and burning up the medication rendering the patch useless. The sweet spot is when you see it super glossy and glazed over all-the-while maintaining the blurry transparency the patch originally had. Once you get it right pop it under the tongue or in between  the gum and cheek. It takes alot of practice and finesse but when you get it right...GOT-DAMN! Be somewhere comfy because you're going down for the count on Unicorn Island son!

Use your head. Know your limits and be damn sure you have a friend around in case it's too potent. That's not going to happen though because you're smart enough to know not to try this! ;P

Oh and I do this with cut up pieces of the patch. Not the entire patch. Use your head.",1524431754.0

I’m not trying to get high as a kite but lately I don’t even really feel “good” when taking the meds... are they canceling each other out? Or is my brain just fried and doesn’t respond to them anymore? For the purpose of blocking opiates the subs def work as I’ve relapsed and not gotten high at all.. but as for the adderal it’s so crazy like I literally can’t even tell that I take it!

This could go in two other subs as well but I love you guys the most and I know many of you have been where I am so here goes...,"First of all I’m 20 months free from heroin. And I’m pretty fucking proud of that. However during those 20 months I was drinking and doing the occasional sub and a line of blow here and there. I told myself no big deal bc the real monster is the opiates. And then while I was stealing some of my mothers pain pills I justified it that heroin is my real problem. 

I’ve had a lot of problems due to my use. I’ve been to 8 treatment facilities and incarcerated 8 or so times (I don’t think I was coherent a few of them so it may be more). Anyways, I just faced some pretty serious legal consequences and managed to avoid prison and instead completed a one year intensive outpatient program (and by intensive I mean 5 days a week 8 hrs a day - 45 min to an hr drive from my house). It was exhausting but I felt great that I did it. This time though I didn’t go to meetings. I didn’t get a sponsor. (And I won’t in the future so please no AA/NA is the only way types bc that not true.) I basically just showed up to group bc I was legally required to. But hey I finished it. Never completed a program in my life. So... go me. To that rehabs credit though they focused on my mental health disorder PTSD and that was amazing help. 

Fast forward a bit I ended up suffering a miscarriage a few months ago. I didn’t even think I could have kids so I was so excited just to be devastated w the loss. But I got through it -clean. 

Something just clicked in me and I don’t feel the need to always non stop think about getting high. I missed so much good stuff in my life doing that. I just feel like I’m over it. I’m too tired to go running around like that again. Staying high everyday is tough work (and people call junkies lazy- bitch please I worked my ass off every day to feed my habit. Granted it wasn’t ethical work or contributing to society but it was work and it sucked and I’m grateful I made it through that.) I’m too old and tired to go through all this again. 

I just got back from an extended visit w my significant other. He lives in another state and has a great job and is moving to my state just to be w me. I am so blessed. He is so sweet to me. Like one of those guys that I’m positive will love me for me forever. My penguin. However,  the visit was great and all but he’s a medical professional (DO) and he doesn’t drink. Doesn’t party. Goes to bed at 9pm wakes up at 4am. He’s an amazing human being and I don’t understand why he lives me like he does. 

Anyways on my trip I was alone in his house all day long. Bored af. It was cold af so there was no going for walks. He has one car and it’s a stick which I can’t drive so I was stuck in the house all day long. Bored af. So. Of course I peruse Reddit for hours on end. Specifically the heroin opiates and cocaine subs. I used to do this just to try and offer support to people like “hey I’m a complete fuck up and I did it you can too”  “Did it” to me means no heroin no shiesty behavior and basically I’m alive not a zombie and around my family and friends now. 

Okay here’s the problem. I started talking to a friend kind of romanticizing how great and eight ball of crack and 30 Oxus would be. Then I was looking at those drug subs all day. Triggered af but stubborn and tough so no big deal I tell myself. Then I get a msg from an old dealer that he’d just like to “see” me. Mmmhmm. I was about to entertain the idea when I decided if I’m gonna do it I’m not getting involved w a dealer. I’ll call a friend and just go party one night and that’s it leave. Well this particular friend and I used to smoke a ton of crack together. I thought I would go over there, we’d do a few hits, go to dinner, then blamo I’m outta there. 

Guys I get to my friends house and he looks like a shell of his former self. Gaunt, can’t remember things for a conversation, tells me the military just deemed him 100% disabled. He’s a combat vet. (W an arsenal of guns in his room. And I mean arsenal. I’m all for gun rights but I think we need to look into the people w serious mental health disturbances but I’m on a tangent)

Moving on. This dude in the almost two years since I’ve seen him has become a crack smoking aficionado. Has a box of special order pipes to his specs. 1000 per box. 3 types of chore boy. Stem holders that double as coolers. 100 bic lighters. Scale that measures to the  .0001. Huge glass jar filled of hard. 7gs to be exact. I almost couldn’t speak it was like heaven and hell at the same time. We ended up smoking it all. I was shaky and felt weird bc I’ve never smoked without heroin to level me out. He gave me some kpins. Thank God. 

He goes to bed. I try to sleep. Made it an hour. Came back upstairs and pushed the fuck out of every pipe we used. My fingers were black from that oily chore. Gross. I don’t want to live like this I just keep going through the motions though. 

He won’t wake up and it was like 11am. Time to get up bud I’ve been up all night. I tell him we need to go get more before I have to go home tonight bc I have regular life Monday that I’m certainly not fucking up. He won’t get up. I get pissed (why? I dunno bc once a junky always a junky and I wanted more) So my genius idea is to go cop myself from the guy that sent me that msg. I kept him in my Facebook “just in case.” (Please no levtures about all we have to change is everything bc as I stated above I’ve been to rehab A LOT.) So I go meet Justin Case and get more hard and he throws me a “tester” of boy.  When I got back I weighed it and it was a fucking half g. For free. Trying to pull me back in. 

I did a line. Bc I’m weak. It was amazing. I’m all warm and fuzzy but I know that’s just heroin  lying. That’s how it gets you hooked into slavery.  Point of my story. I do not want this to be the day I throw everything away (just the heroin in my pocket) I’m not going down that road ever again. I got a preview- it still sucks- I’m still out. 

I can’t believe I did this. But at the same time I’m not gonna wallow around about losing my clean time. When people make mistakes they acknowledge them and move on. Too many times I’ve relapsed and went on a two year bender bc I was so ashamed. So what. I fucked up. I’m handling it. I’m still me and I’m still awesome. I’m still claiming my date bc that’s the day I really began to fight and took my life back. I give zero fucks if anyone disagrees w that. It’s not like I’m gonna stand up at a meeting and say “Hi my name is so and so and I’ve been clean 20 months.” I don’t go to meetings and I’ll live my life how I want. 

I had an abusive controlling ex who died of an overdose and now I currently reside w my abusive mother and I’m tired of being put down. I’ve done it to myself. Others do it. I’m tired of it. Yeah I shouldn’t have done that. But when people make mistakes they shrug em off n keep going. 

❤️

TLDR ended up getting a free half g from a dboy, threw it away (did a line), still consider myself awesome bc I’m not jumping into that nightmare again. 

Also if your sober and have idle hands, stay outta the drug subs kids. If you must go go for support or help and don’t spend hours salivating over drug porn. Learn from me. Ms. FuckUpUSA. And you know what- I’m damn proud of it. 

This could have been way worse. ",1524427639.0

And only a few days after I threw away my dope, I bought it again.

I smoked some that day, but had 200mg left. Yesterday I met a girl who's my ""net-friend"". 

She wanted to buy drugs, and failed at doing so in the city centre. I said I could probably sell her something, and at first I had speed in mind as she already uses it.

She figured out that I had some heroin too, and she really wanted to buy it. At first I was hesitating, not wanting her to start doing it. She told me she was going to share half of it with a friend, and take small amounts/be careful.

I set the price at double the amount I paid. She then nearly doubled the amount I asked for, but I was still hesitating. Then she offered me 5x the price I paid, which I thought would get me a bit money for drugs.

I couldn't resist the offer, though I was also pretty high when I sold her. I'm not a dealer or anything, this was just a one time thing. She said she'd be careful, and remember that this was her first time.

Today she sent me a snap. She took all of it at once by injection. I thought ""Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!!"" because I was afraid she was going to OD. 

Luckily nothing bad really happened, thiugh her body started to shake and she threw up when the comedown hit her. I'm relieved as fuck. But to be honest it really irritates me that she promised to be careful, then she ends up injecting the entire thing when it's her first time!

Meme-poster, shadow commenter and long-time lurker of this sub. Kind of just venting because I feel conflicted.

I moved off of one coast to the other coast (USA) and quit using opiates about seven months ago. I was in a really bad spot after relapsing (I had thrown away three years of sobriety at that point) and I needed to escape. I have a good job at a non-profit and I'm more than likely going to receive a promotion next week- I fell into the normie culture that is your late 20's/early 30's. 

Anyway, when I moved, I totally abstained from opiates here. They're not easy to find where I am and to be honest, at this point I'm too fucking lazy to put in the work to try and find them. BUT- in June, I'm going back to my hometown for five days to visit and I've already been texting with my old dealer (we were... well, kind of friends. Poor Ry-tard- bless his soul) and setting up for him to hook me up with a whole script of percs.

Every logical fiber of my being is telling me- ""NO- don't do this- you know how awful you're going to feel afterward."" but every other passionate part of my brain is like: ""You've been sober for almost a year now- you've earned it- let yourself have fun. Just live in the moment.""

I'm writing this as if I'm going to even consider making a different decision when I know damn well I'm going to cop the first day I'm back home.

There is almost no information on this compound. I have searched through scholar and research databases with no success, and the only information I found about this compound after searching for information for 2+ hours online is:

1. It is 100+ times stronger than morphine
2. It is a codeinone derivative, which is essential for the creation of hydrocodone primarily and, to a lesser extent, oxycodone, as a substitute for thebaine.
Edit: Forgot to add it's LD50:
3. It has an IV LD50 of 31mg/kg in mice. This is much more higher than similar strength compounds like fentanyl. 

From what I know about chemistry and looking at the chem spiders:
*Codeinone is 1/3rd the potency of codeine. Codeinone is a ketone of codeine, which can be achieved by removing two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.
*The addition of a 14-cinnamoyl chain to hydroxycodeinone(which is another name for oxycodone) results in a minimum of 66-fold increase in potency.

This is speculation, but I think this semi-synthetic opioid could change the pressed pills game entirely. Having something that is so powerful in small quantities that is comparable in effects to oxycodone, it seems that it could make pressed roxis become almost identical in effect and feel to the real ones, and cost far less than a dollar per mg. on the street.

Does anyone have knowledge about this substance? It seems completely under the radar of not just research, but RC users and distributors as well.",1524345687.0

Shortly after, a couple of kind do gooders reached out to me and implored me to get a script. One said ""when you have a script, you know you can just go to a real pharmacy and pick it up. No more getting stressed out when someone doesn't answer the phone or doesn't show up on time. Also makes it easier to make travel plans."" Then they ended with ""P.S.- You won't have to deal with that bum Cliff anymore.""

&nbsp;

So I speak to the sub connect and they pushing to see me early at 11am so I say, I gotta sleep off a mean cold but I should be around. They then show up in my 'hood around 11am even though I never responded to their text before they departed.

&nbsp;

Hours later I make new arrangements to meet them half way, near my job. So they take some odd ball bus that doesn't let off near my job. They then text me while on the bus but they don't tell me where they'll be exactly. Then they call.. the call drops. I try to call back no luck.

I get one more text.

""My phone is dying...""

&nbsp;

After I finished my paperwork at work, I head toward home. On my way back home I get a call and the person is like ""no, please meet me on the other-other side of town. You know what, the cross street they proposed was near my planned final destination so I say fuck it I'll do it.

On the way there they go ""I can get a rid to that cross street, there's a mcdonalds I'll go to."" Then they say text when you're 10 minutes away. So I do. Before the 10 minutes the connect texts ""we're here"" and keeps texting ""how many minutes? how far?"" and ""please hurry"". Like dude, I told you exactly how long I would be when I left. There is nothing that changes that on a bike on hilly terrain.

&nbsp;

I get to the cross street. I see no McDonalds. They go ""meet me at McDonalds"" but that's 14 minutes away. So I decide, just meet me at my destination. No, they say we can drive to you mad quick. Well, turns out they could.

&nbsp;

Car pulls up to the curb, she loudly gets out of the car but kindly gives me my product in exchange for cash and it's the mint flavored zubsolvs. The Yemeni deli owners across the street are looking at me like ""that car stopped next to a cyclist, they talked briefly, the car left and the bicyclist went his separate way.""

Before last November, I was taking 10\-20 mgs \(just 1 or 2 pills\) of hydrocodone daily.  Had back surgery in November that went well.  Immediately following surgery for about 2 months I was taling between 6 and 10 Oxycodone a day.  By the end of January, 2018 i had slowed that pace to 1\-2 10mg pills a day.  Since  mid\-March I've been more or less maintaining on just 1 10mg oxy / day.  

By 2 pm every day I feel the screaches.  The reminders that I need the meds.  I've gone for single days a couple of times, but never more than 48 hours before I cave in and relieve the nastiness with a pill.  I'm nearing the end of my prescription, and know I wont have more without making up some kind of story, because my back surgery really was a success.  I want to get off the meds completely, but the question is, how long will I have the immense need to stop the screaches...that piercing ear ringing, the nasty fuzzy head/body need for the dose? 

It's been a very long time since I havent had the meds in the body.  Is there something that will help me get through completely weening the craving?  I've got about 3 weeks worth of oxy left in the bottle at this rate.  I dont want to find the bottom of the jar, without first stopping.

This is how I replied: ""Donating to your local needle exchange isn't a bad idea.

They help keep users from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from dirty needles, give them information on local clinics that treat addiction, and if they can afford it, distribute Narcan that is the #1 way to reverse overdose and save the users' life.

As far as personally, support your friend. There's not a whole lot you can do for an addict other than urge them to stop using (without being crazy about it), and keeping Narcan on hand, in case they overdose in your presence. Learn how to use the Narcan effectively as well.

Thanks for your compassion. Users have a tough time as it is, but if enough people are like you, and care, I think we can take care of this problem.""

We used some more last night, and this morning we both woke up feeling pretty shitty. He had to throw up a few times and I nearly had to while feeling cold. We both have recurring headaches.

This led me to wonder, how quickly can one get withdrawal symptoms from this stuff? And what can one do to ease symptoms such as these? Also, any respectful information on how quickly one can get addicted is appreciated, since we both lost (and gained) some of the typical opiate fears around (ab)use and chipping.

We didn't like it very much at first, yet we both felt the need to use the next day, even though our rational minds told us it wasn't even that fun. I honestly prefer ketamine and benzos to this vague, even slightly nauseating feeling. 

Heroin isn't sold much around here, and we've both used an absolute shit ton of drugs in our lives, 30+ and 60+ respectively, but have never used anything to fill a void. Our lives are fulfilling and we're likely just going to slowly use it up over the next year or so and never seek it out again.

I moved out west around 8 months ago from across the country out east. Shortly after being here I gave in to the temptations and start using black tar. I prefer to use IV and this tar has completely trashed all my veins I can barely find one to hit when I really need too. In my 6 years of using (China white) back out east, I was able to use the same vein a thousand times, only needing to switch it up periodically.

Because of this, and how much money I’m fucking spending, I wanna take at least a long break for now. Get back into healthier habits. The only problem is I’m having an insanely hard time finding suboxone out here.

My good friend from back home said he would happily send me out a couple of strips (4) and a few baggies (to enjoy before the subs). What would you say the best way to do this is? FedEx it all over, just send it in a regular envelope through USPS, etc. Curios to know if anyone on this sub has done this before, has an tips, or better solutions to this problem.

i might even use them to quit subs altogether. 

hopefully i dont get addicted t tram . the jitteryish high at even lowish doseages is kinda weird, but 50mg before taking my subs was fucking awesome and i was pain free for a few hours and i thank that nurse for that one pill that she didnt have to give me due to our fucked up laws. 


and i thank her twice if she actually got me a script (supposedly the papers, and nurse said i did)



i realize to you guys tramadol isnt a big deal but i have seen so many doctors and i even saw a neurologist recently whom i was referred to by my insurance. we called ahead of time and made sure they treated tmj. when i got there , he didnt give me any meds, and told me he does not work with the jaw. he ordered me MRIs of my head, which ive already had done.


I asked him 6 times to order a MRI for my jaw


I was referred to pain management and a chiropractor i cant pay for . even though he said to me ""why go to a chiropractor if you know it doesnt help you""





Atleast this nurses/doctors (she seemed likea new doctor) stayed within her bounds and respected me to the upmost {without getting fired i guess} . The other ERs ive been to have not been kind at all! These guys atleast presented a few options . and atleast gave me a tramadol when i asked . 



i heard her speaking with the nurses about how to override the narcotic thing on the prescription monitoring thing lol. was presented with one tablet to go home . so yea. atleast some respect was given. atleast some relief was achieved. 



do you guys think i would have any luck if i went to a ketamine clinic there are 3 near me

I didn't have a job and he said he could steal some tools from his work. Later in the day we cruised the city with these ancient tools that had to be worth something. The first 2 pawn shops had no interest. We were getting sick and irritated. At last we found a place that was willing to buy them. Excited, immediately we go to the gas station to buy something to drink and a fresh pack of smokes. 

Not knowing who to cop from, we start driving around the hood. Someone will flag us down eventually. A group of OG's flag us down at the house past the stop sign. Behind us a couple houses down we see more people. We decide to turn around and check them out. They ask what we need and let them know we want boy, and we want to try it first.

Led into a house with nothing inside, he hands dude the money and he says I'll be right back. I knew something wasn't right, but J seemed oblivious. A couple minutes later, 2 more dudes storm in and say that J is a cop and he needs to empty his pockets. They said I'm cool because they've seen me before somewhere. He complies, and they throw everything on the floor, including the money we spent hours trying to get. Another guy runs in and grabs the money.  I say to J why are you letting them do that? He didn't know what to do. 

We walked out and the dudes had ""no idea"" where the other guy went. So now we're back in the car, dopesick with no money or dope. We light a cigarette and one of the guys asks for one and snatches the whole pack and walks away. I was so mad at J. He wouldn't stand up for himself and now we had nothing. ",1524273578.0

While I am taking it for pain due to Crohn's I really want to try and live my life without being beholden to medicine. Especially medicine that messes with my mood. 

I have been tapering for the past 6 months. I started at 16mg a day (2x8mg for pain), and was able to go all the way down to 0.5mg a day. But I was miserable. Every day I would go into withdrawals within 6 hours of my last dose. Making the conscious decision to no longer be miserable I started taking 2-4 mg a day. I'm rationalizing it as being needed in order to pass a job interview. 

Long story short, I tried extremely hard to go from 0.5 mg to 0.25 mg so I could jump. Instead of doing this I am wondering if anyone has gone through Rapid Detox while on Buprenorphine? Because of it's long half life I'm wondering if being under while the naloxone works is going to be enough to make it through the worst of the withdrawals. I've never had an issue with wanting to take pain meds again after detoxing, manually. I always start back up from a Crohn's flair. So I figure, I get this job, save up the money for rapid detox in a couple of months and just go get it done and deal with the long term post opiate effects. I'd have to deal with them anyways, I just want to be done with this stuff.

Anyone have experience with these rapid detox places?",1524273687.0

We dropped off the hustler girl that didn't do drugs, and made our way to the spot. ""Joe"" let's us in. We need 5 girls and 5 boys. We spend $100, made by committing various crimes. I didn't participate in much, but I still got a small share. I never liked the way everything was split up. At least I would still get some. 

Ol girl and her friend are prepping up their shots and talking about having hep c. In this abandoned house, we sat in the old dining room I would assume. Dirty yellow walls and brown flooring. A ripped blanket covers the door entry to the next room. Empty baggies and used needles piled up in the corner. A rectangle coffee table sits in front of the ripped up loveseat. My girl didn't have a working rig and didn't want to share immediately after them. They said there might be an extra one in the truck. How stupid. Asking for it. 

As she came back inside, I saw her holding it. The numbers were faded, and there was still dried blood inside and out. In this moment I was consumed by anger and fear. Begging her to not do this. It didn't matter. She needed her dope and there was nothing anybody could do about it. 

I couldn't take it anymore, so I walked outside to the back of the house and sat on what was left of the back porch. No idea what time it was, and I felt like I was alone forever.  Nobody came out to find me like deep inside I wish she would. I knew the reason I was so mad was because we both shared rigs. 

Eventually, I hopped down to the driveway and came back in the house. She was sitting on ol girl's lap. They laughed when they saw the look on my face. How did I get to this point in my life? It wasn't over anytime soon.

She left and we planned to meet up afterwards. When I was leaving she happened to be in the front lobby because she had left some items on the rehab wing. I left two days earlier so she wasn't expecting me to be out yet.

She ended up driving me home and we fucked for hours and quite literally professed our love for each other. We both had multiple Os. I spent the last twenty four hours with her... she just left.

No the sketch part is that she is a stripper, has had two kids, she is 32 and I am 28, and she has an abusive husband who gave her a black eye and put five cig burns on her face and arms the day she got out.

I am also on a high dose of gabapentin. Long story short, my wife cut me off everything two days ago. I thought maybe if I go get a dose of methadone it will help my back pain at least for a little while. I spent 3 1/2 hours in that clinic this morning talking to a counselor, and doctor, filling out paperwork, getting drug tested, etc. This is a long term program and is every involved. I finally took my 30mg dose this morning which tasted like watered down cough syrup and guess what? My back still hurts and I feel exactly the same. I wasted all morning for this. I guess it's back to square one now. Like I said, probably great for the serious addict, but for someone like me it was a waste of time.

I'm feeling tons of anxiety. Out of breath. It's fucking miserable just to walk. I just downed I think 14 of lope and I'm going to drag myself out in a few hours to find some kratom to make it through the weekend.

My body is screaming that I need more drugs--and I definitely did the junkie search to make sure there wasn't anything I had missed (there totally wasn't). It's 2 long weeks until my refill and I've got no plugs and no hope for one. 

I'm trying to remind myself that I wasn't any better on the oxy. I was dosing every 2-3 hours and was completely fucking useless. I slept every weekday for 2 weeks straight. I have been generally unmotivated, empty and void. I'd rather do that sober. 

Weekends are tough cause it's 48 straight hours of the whole family home. I've got nowhere to hide. They can see every step of my pain, every struggle to walk, the difficulty sleeping, the insurmountable fatigue. It's embarrassing. 

I truly hope the Lope and kratom and some caffeine pills will help me make it through. It doesn't help that I ran out literally the day before starting my period, so I've got that on top of everything else.

1: In my house, there is a huge cabinet full of dvd cases. I simply close my eyes, spin a bit to disorient myself. Keep eyes closed. Pick out random case, take out dvd and lay it down so you only see silver. Keep your eyes closed. Then put dope where dvd went, close case, disorient yourself, and place in random spot. Then put the disc in a random spot. Key point, keep eyes closed.

2: Wall full of random books? Close your eyes, take out random thick book. Walk to another room without looking at book, open book without looking at cover. Cut out whole to stash your dope in the paper. Close eyes, close book, go back to bookcase, and put back book in a different spot. ",1524198500.0

He said he’s not ready for a guy (we’re gay) in his life at this point and he thought he was. I’m glad he’s learning more about himself, but I wished it wouldn’t have been at my expense. I didn’t see this coming a million miles away. I can’t help but laugh because I should be so used to shit like this happening to me, but it always blindsides me.

I got really drunk last night and a friend of his held me while I cried. This is why I don’t drink, I embarrass myself.

I think it might be what’s in the fucking dope out there right now. I don’t know. All I know it’s that not even a week of fucking around, literally not even a full .5 altogether,  I woke up yesterday dope sick. Not shit your brains out, projectile vomit (although I did projectile vomit once, it was weird), knocking on deaths door level. But still. Dope sick enough to make me remember why I never want to be in that cycle again. Fuck that. Anxiety, tired but can’t sleep, hot/cold sweats, restless as fuck but still can’t manage to actually function enough to leave the house. 

Maybe I needed this to remind myself why I cannot “just do a shot once in awhile”. Not worth it. Anyway....what the FUCK though? Is my brain just trained to associate doing dope, then not doing dope with withdrawal symptoms? Making me more sensitive to it ? Or is it my first guess, which is this dealer is a piece of shit and if there is any actual HEROIN in that dope, it’s kinda like a  “can I have some heroin with my fentynal please?” ratio. I know when I was regularly using for a year, Fent was just becoming a thing but I noticed the withdrawals were way worse. Even with no tolerance, I did like maybe half a tenth in the first shot, felt that orgasmic rush, literally woke up 4 hours later, so fucked up it didn’t even feel good, barely able to stand up and walk to get myself a water, nauseous, and it was actually not very pleasant. 

Thing is though, unlike fentynal dope I have ever done in the past (including pharmaceutical grade pure fent administered via IV in hospital), this dope had legs. I always hated Fent dope because it had no legs. This shit is every bit like any Fent dope I have ever fucked with except that it stuck around. 

Well, I’m feeling quite hopeless and grim at the moment but I know it’s temporary. But yeah, I’m getting back on the shot. Already have my appointment. I don’t want to die and that shit will surely kill me.

I’ve been doing drugs since high school and I thought I was invincible, xans, coke, acid, molly, etc.  I thought I couldn’t be addicted, that it was all in the head.  Boyyyy was I wrong.  It started in January 2017, im an 18 year old freshman in college and i was looking to score some oxys since I had done em a couple times before but never frequently, just opportune times.  A boy hooks me up with a dealer who had 20s.  It was awesome, I finally had a way to get oxys since they hd been so rare.  But the biggest problem was the fact that he always hd them, so I didn’t take days off because “who cares?”.  8 months straight of doing hella oxys and I’ve spent so much ducking money.  I can barely even afford them anymore so my plug tells me he can get me this other shit and it’s way cheaper.  That’s when I started with heroin, again it was awesome since it was cheap as hell, but as tolerance built I was in the same situation.

Towards the end of this year I had to face my problem... well that’s a lie, my parents caught me and I had to admit my problem mainly because I was broke and I couldn’t handle withdrawals.  So early this January they put me on subs... but it wasn’t that easy.  I still wanted to get fucked up, so whenever I got money I’d buy heroin and stop taking my subs,  2 months of this and getting caught 2 more times.  We are now in March and it’s time to do it for real.  I’ve been taking a sub a day since then and now I feel great.  I don’t crave opiates anymore, I never thought I would feel this way again.  Not having to worry about getting money to not be sick, just enjoying myself without this shit controlling me.

I know this same story has probably been said about 100 times by 100 different people, but it’s just my story.  My advice to any of you kids around my age that are thinking the same way turn the fuck around. You idiots who post pics of oxys and think it won’t take over your life and everyone else is just a junkie idiot but YOU can’t get addicted because your different.  Well guess what?  You aren’t different and if you keep taking this shit you will ruin your life.  Luckily I didn’t go as far as shooting and I’ve managed to maintain my college grades but who knows where I’d be if I went a couple months longer.

That drugs will make it so the only thing you want is more drugs, at any cost. mom has heroin and you don't? you're going to stabville. yes even pot will evoke matricide. they have been teaching it this way for decades. if you are american, you know all about the ridiculous  drug education programs. guess what adults? the programs  are still mostly the same ridiculous propaganda. well My nephew and his friends, seniors and jocks, were so  astonished people could drive high, i questioned more .( they smelled weed from my friends car). They All were naive enough at 18, to still be  believing, that even with weed you can't control your self while high. i asked and found it's all the same shit still being taught. thus this post   SooooooooooooooO TEENAGERS LISTEN:  No, weed wont ruin your life. lsd doesn't make you jump out of tall buildings, and crack/ heroin are not addictions caused by one time use. You See, foolish as this sounds, we called their bluff on addiction. after being taught the same lies, we tried every drug. interestingly, we had not become addicts. obviously  they lied. They lied about everything except opiates. OPIATES Are not to be Fucked with. You will be dependent! it will control you. even as little as twice or once a week of controlled use can/will have you waking up dopesick, and unsure how weeks have passed since that 'control'. it doesn't take many days to get the ball rolling. IVE SMOKED CRACK/cocaine  scores of times/ Some times 3-4 dayS in a row. PERSONALLY I never had any withdrawal or cravings from coke.(this is just me though). BUT IVE BEEN A physically dependent heroin addict for over a decade! I don't have a problem with any of the other drugs. heroin will own you, it's undefeated. do not start using it.  they were not lying about opiates. now that you have the truth,  live life and find your joy.  find that joy any possible way, any way  that doesn't include opiates.  you're not special and you can't beat heroin  addiction's first enslavement. eventually, it will take control of your priorities and strong/weak, the end result is always the same. you will lose.  YOU will choose heroin over everything while with drawling. no human has won so far. it will leave you sweating, but bone cold. next you begin shitting while puking from the toilet. the  only break from this will be sneezing in rapid  fits.  that leads to routinely  wiping off the sweat accumulated . then you will be back to shitting ,while shivering.  sometimes, these symptoms   occur simultaneously.  sound fun?

I’m pretty aware of the main downsides to methadone. It would be annoying to be on a short leash like that, but I can’t afford to travel much anyway. Living at home with my mom, going to school right here soon, and I know there’s a couple clinics to choose from within ~20 mins of me. 

I avoided maintenance for years. I was so good at hiding the worst of my habits from my family. I didn’t want to commit to being opioid dependent forever but I realized I was already there so I got on subs. Please, please don’t say anything about how hard methadone is to get off of. I know. I can handle that side of things.

But last night I smoked a bowl pack after doing my little dose and I was like full on nodding harder than I ever have before and it lasted like 3 hours. It was nuts. 
 
I regularly take benzos that are prescription. Usually 2mg of kpin and 2mg of Xanax at night with a benedryl or a trazadone to sleep so it takes a lot to make me drowsy.

Last night I only took 2 kpins and no Xanax or trazodone. Normally that does nothing with such a small little bump of dope just a good relaxing feeling before bed.  The only difference was this time I smoked a bowl pack of weed and I was nodding so hard I was scared to sleep and stayed up until 4am when it totally wore off.

About noon yesterday I did a full point from the same batch and a full point again around 4 from same batch and it was super mild. That .04 at 11pm knocked me out hard and it was less than half of the earlier doses.

And all these shows (?) won’t hold me down
I detach myself
You put me through hell
I knew you too well
You don’t deserve my help.
I don’t know if I will be the same
I know that you’re never gonna change
You told me to find a way to grow
Held your hand and watched you let it go
I’ll never know if we were just dreaming 
I let it go but I still believe in (?)
That this love can take us places
I still love the time we wasted.

Idk this song really stands out I don’t relate to to a lover but rather my DOC... Idk shitpost sorry I have nothing else to say

Really have to call it quits, last shot today and have 2 8mg sub strips to get me through the worst of it, plan on taking as little as possible to just feel normal enough to get through work, and am ordering some potent Kratom that should be here by Saturday. Posted this a bunch in the last month but this time I’ve gotta do it, have a lot of significant life events coming up that I cannot afford to be addicted to opiates for. Wish me luck, will try to keep up with this sub but a lot of the times it is a trigger for me so we shall see.

Note: God = God, the universe, your respective God by name, or a stand-in for gosh, goodness or golly.. Nonetheless, the three words for OMG are what I naturally blurted out upon hearing that which I shall share exclusively right here right now.

&nbsp;


Earlier today I woke up, communicated with Cliff and upon getting paid, arrangements were made. A week ago I took $100 dope and cash on loan. Why? Well I decided I didn't mind biking to the ATM on his behalf with his card if I was gonna be given dope right after. I did get dope right after and all went according to plan aside from getting home at 6AM but that was because I was playing games on my new-old-new laptop and making plans to see the new Avengers movie. 


Yesterday went extremely well. I didn't feel like anyone acted particularly shady, I got my money's worth every which way. First I got exactly one bun from Cliff minus the middler's fee for our middle. Then later after work I was like ""you know, I want more but I didn't buhy more earlier because I didn't want to expose myself to shenanigans or tempt Cliff or faith."" Yeah, that quote pretty much sums up my thought process.

&nbsp;

Thus I contacted Derrick for a half, then realized he was actually walking to his guy to pick it up and front it so I upgraded to a full bun, I only asked for a half because I thought he was gonna pull from personal stock. He took only one bag and it was all fat and good dope. Shortly after that, which occurred after work.. I ate dinner then paid a visit to Cliffords house.

&nbsp;


Well first to get to the point of this post, something I assure shall amuse you, or anger you, or bubble up some sense of obligation that makes you urge me to contact adult protective services, I must rewind to how things got to the OMG moment.


&nbsp;

Before work I drop by Cliff's hoping the dboy/middle would show up before I had work. He didn't, he showed up 10 minutes after I left for work so I had to bike back on my break. I couldn't wait a minute longer than I did and still be on time so I cut temporal losses.


Upon arriving at Cliff's his TV wasn't in the living room. I thought he was just dope sick and too lazy to move his TV but it turned out that the electrical power was turned off in his and his mom's apartment. To watch TV and to maintain power to the internet modem/router he ran an extension cord from his sister's dwelling. Strangely, he didn't even power the fridge. Just the TV, blu-ray player and modem. The modem became useless too after the cable company turned that off. I guess both of those bills were due today.

&nbsp;

So if not for the fact that I owed Cliff $100 from last week, he would have no way to get dope and when given a choice between electricity and dope he chose dope. Well, can't fault him for that.. I'm sure many of us have done similar lol.


&nbsp;

Okay, well, now that we got the setup out of the way here goes the mess of a punchline!


As some may know, every two weeks Cliff then his mom gets their roxy script. Cliff has to share some with is mom because she shares some with him. It'd be easier for her if she simply said ""I'm keeping mine for me, and you keep yours for you"". Sort of like what I did to bring my costs down so that I could buy electronics and bike parts. I'm not dooing perfect, in that I shouldn't be buying dope for myself at all but if I'm gonna buy dope I want to make sure I take care of Numero Uno first and foremost. 


I mean like, if his mom didn't have to share with him, she'd have more and wouldn't need him to give her any when it was his script day. I would say the inverse applies to Cliff but he doesn't have the discipline to conserve a script without having to tap other sources. I mean yeah, I've seen him go through just 5 roxies 15's in one day but I don't really know if he was that conservative that day when he said he was. It's conceivable... but not the point of this tale.

&nbsp;

His mother has bad knees and she has been prescribed various opioids for over a decade. I remember when she used to get vikes. Sometimes I'll hear Cliff's mom moan and demand or request ""something to take"" from Cliff. If he is honestly at the bottom of the barrel he'll ask me, ""do you have any ibuprofen or Tylenol?"" They've bought bottles of acetaminophen...who cares how it's spelled but they disappear in no time once either one of them runs out of roxies. 


So like, what's worse is... there are times where Cliff will get blues between script days so he'll give some to his mom to take.. but of course she usually takes 15mg roxies so he'll break the blue in half. Then she'll complain she only got half. It's tough. The other day she actually wanted a second goblin and Cliff was like ""you gotta wait for it to take effect"", in fact that was right after he gave his last legit scripted pill to her.

&nbsp;


Finally, this evening Cliff was telling me what he did earlier that day. First the light stuff, at some point days ago he gave his mom 4mg of Suboxone and she slept really well. Sleep is something that comes hard for her, and when she don't get sleep she might be miserable enough to bug Cliff about all manner of bullshit shenanigans. From food to bills. Heck, if Cliff is too lazy to get up and she gets up and falls.. that's a whole operation so a sleepy Cliff's mom usually results in an undisturbed Cliff.


&nbsp;

Oh my gosh, I still didn't get to the point!


Alright here goes.... Cliff told his mom that a bag of Heroin was ""pure oxy"" and told her she could take it one of two ways. She took it and said the oxy was really good, felt good, licked the pain and all. 


ughhh... oh my God, jeeze, fuck.. like really? I'm just flabbergasted here. If flabbergasted could make a sound that sounded like a stuttering platypus, that's sort of me right now while pronouncing the word flabbergasted.

I had the day off so that I could go to therapy and I figured I’d end the latest binge and get back on the right track. Went to therapy sick as fuck and left my phone in my car. When I came back out I had a message from ol’ girl to come through and of course my addict brain said fuck everything lets get well. I picked up a friend and we drove to meet this chick. Long story short, we get to her around 4pm and we didn’t leave until about 7-7:30. Her plug had her driving all over the goddamn place while we waited at her house. I was going fucking nuts because at this point I was more fucking dopesick and losing my patience. This bitch  had us waiting at a gas station for an hour, then we had to drive 20 minutes to her apartment, and then we sat there for another two hours before ol middle girl finally came through. At that point I could’ve just taken the sub and been fucking fine, but noooooooooo I’m a fucking dipshit. And then she comes back with some RP 30s (they’re legit but meh). I had heard that these were being pressed around here so I fucking get out my narcan as my friend fucking chews a whole one and I stay sick for another 15 or so minutes until I realize that she isn’t gonna fall out (I was driving so I didn’t wanna do one of mine and risk ODing). I’m a paranoid motherfucker.

Tl;dr was gonna get back on subs but didn’t and waited three ours to get 30s even though I could’ve technically just taken it and said fuck the waiting game.

8ddqpi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ddqpi/the_subway_station_christ/,5,https://redd.it/8ddqpi,Stadtmitte,The Subway Station Christ,"The first time that I walked through the (name redacted) subway station- back in my undergrad years before I had ever really seen heroin in the flesh, let alone having it become the focal point of my life- I was disgusted, unnerved, and mildly intrigued. The junkies panhandling there sat side by side, arms wrapped around bony knees, murmuring a small thanks anytime a passerby dropped a coin in their cups (always from a distance, as if to avoid catching whatever soul-disease they had). When the crowds were thin, they'd break out the foil and smoke their dope in the open. However, that was rare, and most of the time they would just sit in silent agony, sweating and stinking. When I passed by them on the way to school, I couldn't help but sneak a furtive glance, curious to see something that most people appeared to try not to look at. I vividly remember watching one pick up the stub of a cigarette to find it had some tobacco still packed in it.

How the hell could somebody do that to themselves? I wondered. I was no stranger to masochism, but the level of shamelessness and lack of fucks given by these homeless junkies exceeded anything I had ever seen. Most people ignored them, but there were plenty of dirty looks. Unfazed, the junkies held out their cups. They shot up and smoked up in front of kids, in front of elderly tourists. If the police came, they dragged their ragged asses up and away for about 15 minutes, then settled right back down. For all I know, they even slept there. Sleep, beg, dig through garbage, shoot up, repeat. What a life. Every day I passed by them, I sneaked a peek and imagined what they were thinking. When I became hooked myself, I understood completely. One day you're the master's student, the next you're living out of garbage cans.

Near the end of my study abroad semester, I was walking through the same station to go study for final exams. One of the regular junkies – the one with the filthy long black corpse-hair and roman nose - sat in his usual spot, eating something no doubt dug out of the trash bin next to him. Two companions nodded off next to him, evidently having recently shot up. Above him, the electronic subway sign read in loud words “No stops here today-- train driving through.” Some sort of maintenance on the line. This meant that, as opposed to the usual train rumbling to a slow stop to allow the passengers off, the train would barrel straight through the station onto the next one, fast as hell and loud as you can imagine. I always stood as far back as I could when the trains drove through, just an instinctual human reaction to stay the fuck back from theses steel beasts. You could really feel the power as they clanged and chugged and rumbled through- *don't fuck with me, i'll eat you up, step right up and see if you can stop me*! They flew by so fast you couldn't even make the individual cars up, making it look like one giant single machine. 
	

For the first time, when I was furtively staring at the junkies, he raised his eyes from the floor and met mine. I heard the rumbling from the depths of the tunnels behind me. The junkie's eyes were blue and wide and full of some sort of distant emotion- longing, maybe? Desire for something that doesn't exist, or maybe never did? He stared at me for a full 5 seconds, not blinking, not moving. The rumbling grew louder. Putting his mangy hands on the floor (I noticed he was missing a finger), he pushed, coming to a crouch and an unsteady stand. A rig dropped from his pocket. The rumbling came to a roar and my bones vibrated with the telltale sign of the train about to pass through the station. 

The junkie's expression changed in an instant- his eyes brightened, the ragged folds of his mouth curled to a soft smile, and his posture erect. He lost 10 years of age in a second. His sporadic teeth looked like tombstones in an ancient graveyard, but they accentuated his smile. I found myself unconsciously reaching for my wallet, feeling for some reason that I needed to give him cash, lots of it, maybe everything I had, because I KNEW he would use it to turn his life around, that he would clean up and settle down and come back to life, I could help him, that he would change the world with his greatness. What I felt in him was something so powerful, so compelling, that this one smile would lead to two lives changed- his getting clean, and me finding whatever fulfillment I was seeking and conquering whatever loneliness that filled my life. I felt my life in his smile. 

I opened my mouth to ask him his name when he stepped forward. He walked slowly, erect, Christlike. He brushed me aside, focusing on something behind me. He hadn't even seen me at all. He took another step forward. The train emerged, flying with reckless abandon from the far end of the tunnel. The junkie smile and stepped forward off the edge of the platform as the train barreled through, the smile never leaving his face.

When I first tried heroin, much later, his face came to mind. 4 years later and that junkie is me, and you can be damned sure that this ""opting-out,"" the quickest way out of addiction, just a train-station away, is always and forever at the back of my mind.

like, i have a great job. i just found out today that i’m getting a 23% raise ($10.5k) PLUS a $5k bonus in my next check this weekend. i could use that money on travel, actual experiences. i fucking love to travel, i love seeing new places and meeting new people. if i weren’t sniffing my entire paycheck up my nose every month, i could go to a lot of really neat places!

So I know that Narcan, when administered, blocks the opiate receptors in the brain from the opiates you've taken...But that doesn't mean it gets completely rid of the opiates in your system, right? 

Along with this I know after someone is given Narcan that they can go into immediate opiate withdrawal, which makes me more confused as to if Narcan just completely rids your body of all opiates...???

What I mean is, for example, if someone does heroin and is overdosing and given Narcan, it will block the opiate receptors in the brain but the heroin would still be detectable in their system for the normal amount of time heroin is detectable, right? 

I simply cannot imagine that an OD antidote would be able to just instantly get rid of any trace of opiate in your system.

I've spent the better part of fifteen years either waiting on the d-boy or being harassed by junkies waiting on me to *be* the d-boy. I've done it in rain, sleet, snow, blizzards, more than one hurricane, on both coasts, in the concrete metropolises of the North and in the toothless-ness of the rural South. And because this, apparently, is the kind of knowledge I have that I can pass along to the next generation, here I am. At least until they let me give this talk to kindergartners (again) or offer Junkie 101 at the community college.

We're gonna talk about three things: What to Do, How to Do It, and What Not to Do. My goal is to make this as easy as possible and instill a sense of confidence in the people who think copping drugs is too hard or too dangerous. If anyone has anything to add please chime in and I'll add it to post. I'd like this to be a community effort that, in the spirit of harm reduction, can help people stay safe in what is one of the less dangerous, but more nerve-wracking, parts of addiction.

#What to Do

There are a few ways to cop your drug of choice, but they all basically break down to one of two ways: open-air shopping or using a middleman.

Of the two, open-air markets are the logistically easier, but psychologically harder of the two. Most of the time just living in a city will make you familiar with the ""bad part of town."" When it isn't obvious which neighborhoods are shitty just Google for heroin busts, prostitution arrests, violent crime, and the like.

Once you know where you're doing you need to know what to do. For that I invite you to the next section.

The second method - using a middle - is less psychologically taxing than doing the dirt yourself, but presents it's own unique challenges. Of these, the one most posted is, of course, *""How do I find a middle?""* You're obviously looking for an entree into the world of degeneracy, so let me ask - if you're looking for a junkie, where would you find them?

Narcotics Anonymous meetings are a sure-fire way to meet junkies and methadone/Suboxone clinics are, by definition, full of people currently skull fucked on various poppy-related products. The downside here is, obviously, these are places where people go to get help with their addictions and while, yes, you're looking for help too it's kinda in the opposite direction of the help generally offered in these locales. If you can square it with your conscience then these are places full of helpful junkies... *Who you're going to drag back into the gutter, you horrible, horrible human being.* (Kidding... Well, mostly kidding.)

As mentioned by /u/billinsandiego, a good number of people attending AA/NA meetings are there because it's court ordered (Obviously, since each is independent, this depends on the meeting - location, time, etc.) Also, traditionally while you may be called out in the room and asked to leave, it's unlikely that law enforcement would be called for anything short of disrupting the meeting. Law enforcement, in general, leave the rooms alone because it's viewed as a helpful tool in helping people get clean. (In other words don't stand up and say, *""Hi, my name is Needa Hookuplz and I'm looking for a hook-up... Please.""* Try to be a bit smoother than that.) Finally, to increase your odds of finding a middle while expanding your network of fellow addicts it pays to look for meetings with a featured guest speaker as opposed to the normal, more casual meetings. *(Thanks /u/billinsandiego.)*

Aside from a junkie-buddy, your next option is going to be finding a more tertiary introduction. Homeless dudes literally live on the street and they know it better than you know the layout of your living room. Asking one for help finding street-based degeneracy is like asking a fish to find water. Prostitutes are in the same boat, albeit their's is more *Love Boat* and less refugee raft made of old oil drums and desperation. As a bonus, the homeless and the professionals are less likely to try and bleed you slow as a price for middling - but that's discussed below.

Prostitutes bring us to the newest (and most likely filled with bullshit and scams) way to find what you're looking for - the internet. Setting aside Dark Net Markets (which have been written about before by people much, much smarter than me - check out /r/darknetmarketsnoobs as a starting point; thanks to /u/spiritualasf for reminding me about that subreddit) you can use Craigslist, Backpage, and other internet classifies-style sites to find not only professional women but also, using the correct search terms, legit dealers.

*(I'm not 100% sure on what all the common drug-related search terms are, so if anyone would like to help me out with a list, I'd appreciate it. Also maybe a list of the most common drug-scams? This is out of my wheelhouse. Thanks.)*

#What Not to Do

Okay, so you've found a shitty 'hood. You've got money, transportation, and a need that can only to be filled with suspicious powders. So it's time to trade that money for those powders.

A lot of what I'm about to say is a mixture of common sense and street smarts. The next section, What Not to Do, will detail the Don'ts so you can avoid getting robbed, scammed, hurt, or arrested. This section is more the prototypical what I'd tell the nervous hood newbie before sending him out to sink or swim.

First, you need to know your local slang for the drug you want. Asking for *""One heroin please!""* is a good way to get your pockets ran. When I first moved to Chicago I had no idea what the fuck *""blows""* were - I always thought blow equaled coke - and correcting them by saying, *""No, I need a gram of heroin,""* had me turned away a few times before I caught on.

If you're in a car (which I highly recommend until you have more experience with the area) make the block once or twice to, hopefully, catch anything untoward - parked police cruisers, vacant-eyed creepy children, eldritch aliens, whatever. Once you're comfortable, pull up, locked doors, only the driver's window down, and place your order.

Some sets do hand-to-hands - money-to-drugs - some will have you give your cash to one guy and get your dope from another, hell, some might have fucking delivery pigeons. For the most part, however, it will happen in one stop, one transaction. Being asked to hand over the cash, pull away/make the block/part over there, isn't unheard of, but unless I knew that's how the set operated I never let my money walk more than a few feet away. Once that cash is in their hands it's theirs - ain't like you can co complain to a cop. Keep that in mind.

But, more importantly, is to remember that they're running a business. Unhappy customers don't come back, so burning you once for $100 is worth way less than someone coming back regularly. That's not to be said it never happens, so be cognizant of the situation around you. Avoid buying from single individuals - try to buy from a full-on set at a corner or on a stoop; don't fuck with randoms walking around. People alone could be hooked into a crew, or the could be freelancers - or they could be looking for an easy mark - while dudes sitting around in a group are obviously organized and doing more serious dirt then Scruffy Jimmy just ambling around.

Lastly - get a phone number from them. Calling ahead to make sure they're on can save you a ton of bullshit. Bullshit which could lead you to making poor decisions in the name of trying to make something happen. Pro-tip: avoid all possible flavors and varieties of bullshit.

Being on foot has many of the same considerations as copping in a car, just with the tension upped a bit. You'll still need to have your entry and exit planned - including alternate routes. You still need to carry the minimum cash necessary. I'd only take my ID, cash, and burner phone. Keep your cash somewhere secure, but easy to get to. You don't want to fumble around in a wallet while your dealer is looking at you like the world's saddest moron. Like I've said, Street Shit 101.

Exiting the area is the same on foot as it is in a car. Get in, cop, get out. Don't stop a block away to fix in your car or shoot up in an alley. You just open yourself up to getting harassed by the desperate or despicable - homeless and cops, respectively. Get home before you fix, but if you absolutely can't wait, well, sorry, but fixing in public is beyond the scope of this guide.

Lastly, let's talk about getting stopped. While I've seen and used a ton of ways to mitigate this eventuality (because it *will* happen, eventually) and dealing with the police is something every criminal needs to know how to do - and, ideally, do well - the fact is that being in a shitty neighborhood isn't a crime. The easiest way to avoid getting arrested after buying drugs is to not do anything illegal... Well, anything *else,* I suppose.

In other words, keep your papers (license, insurance, registration, and tag) up to date. Have no rigs, straws, cookers, or other paraphernalia in your car. Assume that if it's hidden, no matter how well, it can be found - because it can. And as much as it sucks, at the end of the day, swallowing your drugs is *way* better than catching a charge. *(And yes, CPD, I'm still pissed about needing to swallow that dope on fucking Christmas Eve, you holly, jolly, Christmas-ruining fucks.*) I keep an open 20 oz. bottle of coke exactly for this reason.

*An aside here - I've had the debate of hidden versus trashed way too many times. If you've got faith that your boy-pussy won't be probed, then, by all means store whatever you want in your sin cave. I'd rather just re-buy my dope than risk it, but hey, you do you... And do that boy-pussy goooood.*

Okay, so that's how you conduct yourself in an open-air market, but what are the niceties in dealing with a middle? We've talked about *where* and *how* to find them but what do you do once one if on the hook?

First off - felonies aren't free. It might cost you ten bucks or ten thousand. They might want you to buy them their own bag, or a rock, or a bottle. The point is that be ready to pay them for their help. It might be a tricky issue to breach, but talking upfront about what they're expecting will leave both parties in a better position. Overpay, underpay, haggle - do whatever you want, but be ready to pay *something.*

Buying their connect - outright paying for an introduction - is almost always going to be easier and cheaper in the long run. You'll pay less, over time, but more importantly you'll never be on Middle-man Time. (Just Dealer-Time, but that's something else.) They might balk, but offering more cash or threatening to walk away is an easy way to call the bluff. Damn near every dealer in the world wants more customers. Just taking the number (off their phone or yours if they use it) works but so does tire iron applied to a kneecap - like I've said, you do you.

That being said... 

Never let your money walk. If it's too good to be true it probably is. Never put more money in their hand than you're comfortable losing. Never let them discuss the deal with you able to hear at least their side of the conversation. Never let them handle the dope without you watching. If they're sick don't trust a single word they say. Spend every minute thinking about how they could fuck you - because I guarantee they're thinking of the perfect way to bend you over. As above - Hood Shit 101. I could give you a dissertation on street smarts, but, really, you either get it or you don't. Everyone gets taken a few times at first - they're just expensive lessons.

#What Not to Do

Above all I want to say this - if you're scared to cop because you think you'll ""be robbed"" or ""thrown in jail"" then you should really reevaluate whether or not drugs are a good hobby for you. *(Also it's kinda racist that you think just because you're a honky in the hood you're gonna get mugged or jammed up by 12.)* Ninety-nine times out of a hundred dealers are just dudes trying to make ends meet. In other words, they're people - just like me and thee.

That being said, there are ways to avoid being a victim of that last one percent. Be respectful, direct, and distantly polite. Make eye contact but don't stare. Carry yourself like you have a reason to be there. Don't dress overly flashy or carry expensive shit - purses, jewelry, phones. Don't *ever* talk shit because there is always someone willing to cash that check. Obviously, if you're white, don't say racist shit. *(The number of newbies I've seen that thought they could say ""Nigga"" in a roomfuls of bangers is stupidly high.)* Don't ask questions about their operation, their set, or how they function. Don't use overly precise terminology since it seems cop-ish and makes people nervous. Don't carry a weapon because it escalates the situation, any possible criminal charges, and you're way more likely to get hurt if you have one. *(You are not Rambo or John Wick. You're reading an internet guide about how to buy drugs on the street for Mother Morphine's sake. If anything screams, ""I don't need to a carry a gun"" more than that, I'll be fucked if I know what it is.)*

Just don't act like a tourist and, most likely, you'll be fine.

#Expanded, Additional Points

**- Copping As a Female**

While I'm not a woman, I've had a few junkie lovers and a few platonic female friends so I can draw from their experiences.

Being female changes the situation some, and in some pretty significant ways, but the base calculus mostly remains the same. Some dealers/middles might offer to trade drugs for sexual favors. It's depressingly common, and most prostitutes I've known started out pimped by their significant other or by preforming their first commercial sex acts with their dealers.

Some people might be more protective of females. As the risk of sounding like a racist *(build der wall, ya'll - /s)* Mexicans culture has a ton of extra machismo lying around and I've seen that translated as a degree of extra respect towards and protection for women. Take that statement with a grain of salt.

A female will get a harder look from a cop than a man, but the cop is less likely to push the issue and let you go. Searching/dealing with chicks is different and requires resources which might not be readily available.

The dangers largely remain the same, but with the added danger of sexual violence. The trade-off is that violence against a woman, or scamming a woman, is a bit rarer than against a man. That plus being able to more easily approach other women (minus prostitutes - they're easier to approach as a dude) and the added arsenal of feminine wiles - if one chooses to employ them - would make copping, in my opinion, easier for a chick than a man.

My biggest piece of advice to a female junkie would be this: be leery of accepting favors, freebies, or fronts from a dealer. Maybe he's just a cool dude doing you a solid, or maybe he's looking to get repaid in a way you might not be cool with. Just something to consider.

*(this section was added based on the question and recommendation of /u/ak47revolver9. i should have considered the difference between the sexes in the original post. thank you, ak.)*


**- A Final Note on Middles.**

The chief rule to remember when working with a middle is that, *They are not your friend.* Maybe they will be, one day, but until that chilly day in Hell they are, most likely, just working the calculus on fucking you over. Hell, even if they're a friend they're probably still doing that math.

Remember - you're subsiding for their habit. Would you want to give up working with someone who's paying you to cop dope when you were already going to cop dope? Nope - me either, so they really won't want let you go once you're on the hook. 

Be prepared that if they don't want to play ball and sell you the connect's information or you can't find a way to get the number yourself, then it's time to break out the big boy panties and act like you belong in the hood. Walk up with your middle once the transaction has been talked about on the phone. Refuse to let your money walk even a few feet away. Don't let them discuss the deal outside of earshot and never let the middle handle the drugs. Don't buy into the line, *""My guy don't like meeting new people,""* because I've never seen a dealer who's good with turning away customers. Explain to your middle that things can be done your way, and he can get a little something, or he can try to fuck you around until you tell him to kick rocks and then he gets nothing. There's always another middle.

Like I said - wear them big boy panties and act like you belong on these streets.

*(Thanks to /u/Mu_Kappa_Delta for pointing out that getting the middle out of the picture as fast as possible is almost always the best practice.)*


#Last Words

This isn't meant to be the end-all, be-all, dogmatic how-to guide to buy drugs. These are my personal recommendations based on personal experience, things I've seen, junkie camp-fire stories, and dope-fiend Apocrypha. For every person buying, selling, or middling dope there's a different way to do it. As long as you don't end up hurt, robbed, or arrested you've done it right.

I'm happy to answer any questions, expand on any of this, or incorporate any good points or suggestions into the body of the post. As comments and discussion come in I'l update this post, and thanks to everyone who's helped with comments, suggestions, and critiques.

I never expected an an answer but after wading through a whole bunch of offers for sex, I finally found a guy who was willing to help.

Got a full bottle of 55 Norcos. Only 5 mg, but anything is better than nothing. My pain is coming down, and I'm finally able to relax. And the best part? Guy gave me the bottle for FREE. He was just a genuinely nice guy who wanted to help.

Not sure if that counts as a junkie Jesus moment, but he was definitely JJ in disguise to me.

Back in November I got arrested and charged with forgery (a class C felony in the US) and possession of stolen property (a misdemeanor in the US). I am a first time offender. I have been able to get the misdemeanor charge dropped, but am still facing charges for forgery. 
My lawyer tried to get me diversion through the prosecuting attorneys office but I was rejected from entering the program. 
At this point, there's a possibility I will get the chance to get the opportunity to do drug court. Drug court is a 12-24 month program where you have to submit to weekly monitored UAs, have a nightly curfew, have to live in halfway or sober housing, have a mandatory minimum amount of meetings to attend, have to appear in court weekly, and must be attending treatment (inpatient, intensive outpatient, and then outpatient). During your weekly court date if you have any violations you will face jail time. A lot of people end up spending 24 months in the drug court program and end up serving more time than if they would have just pled guilty. If you don't successfully complete drug court you get the maximum penalty allowed by law for your crime. For me that would be up to 10 years in prison and up to $10,000 in fines. If you do successfully complete drug court, you are not convicted of your crime.
My other option is to see what kind of deal I can get for pleading guilty. I'd have to take the felony  conviction for forgery but I would serve probably 90 days at the most... I could potentially get away with not doing any more jail time at all, and just spend time on probation.

Anyone have any input/feedback for me? ",1524088974.0

I smoked a bit in the morning until I was feeling pretty good then did a tiny little bit bigger shot then I normally do and I immediately felt it. I was struggling to keep my eyes open to rinse my rig out and when I was done and ended up throwing up afterwards and was on the floor of my bathroom nodding out over the toilet bowl for a good 20 minutes or so. Then afterwards I had a gnarly headache and I was puking periodically throughout the day. And this was like a migraine type headache too it was awful.

I usually practice excellent harm reduction techniques and am able to register on the first poke. 
Unfortunately, due to a combination of not being able to make it to the needle exchange last week and missing my shot because I was in a rush to do it in a public bathroom, I ended up with an abscess. 
In the past I've missed a few shots here and there and ended up with a pretty angry feeling lump for a few days that ends up going away on its own. Not this time! I got a lump where I missed my shot and it got more swollen, red, and painful as the days went by until it caught the attention of a medical professional. I  convinced the doctor that it wasn't *that* bad but he told me if it got any worse to get medical attention.
Of course, my abscess continued to get worse until I couldn't take it anymore and went to have it looked at. On Sunday I had to have it ""lanced"" and ""drained"". (By ""lanced"" I mean they used a scalpel to make about a half inch long incision. By ""drained"" I mean the doctor squeezed the abscess with every ounce of strength she had, and then proceeded to use tweezers, the scalpel, and god-knows-what-else to root around under my skin to find more places to squeeze.) Once the doctor was satisfied, the incision was then packed with some gross yellow antibacterial fabric. Finally, I was prescribed a week of antibiotics and advised to have my dressing changed daily at any urgent care or emergency room until further notice. 
""Until further notice""... Hmm... Interesting word choice, right? Let me explain what that apparently meant... ""Until further notice"" meant that even though I think I'm getting my dressing repacked and changed, I am actually probably going to be getting my arm scalpeled open and violently drained until further notice. Yep, I've had the same abscess cut to pieces, squeezed, poked, and prodded for the last 3 days straight. It doesn't get any less painful either. I can't wait until this thing can start healing!

So what's the moral of the story? Don't ever compromise your safety by not practicing excellent harm reduction techniques.

It’s been real.","After using since 2008, which started as a once in a while thing, and then getting my first taste of physical withdrawal in 2011, it’s been a long nine-and-a-half years.  I’m tired.  Tired of sitting in cars in bad parts of town (or a major city just north of me) waiting for that immaculate “come thru” text.  Tired of feeling like absolute dog shit half of the time and feeling great about 10% of the time. Tired of needing something to get through a 9-hour shift at whatever restaurant I’m cooking at (and barely keeping my job).  Tired of blowing through a $850 paycheck in four days and having literally NOTHING to eat in my house.  Tired of having to eat where I work just to survive the week.  I’m fucking exhausted, ya’ll.  After going back and forth between subs and boy, and now boy and kratom, I’ve finally found my way out.  Kratom really, really works for me, it knocks out 100% of my withdrawal symptoms and even provides a nice mood and energy lift.  Say what you want about trading one addiction for another, I don’t care.  The only thing I give a red fuck about is my paycheck and how I’m going to fix my car that I’ve neglected for years and currently won’t start.  I got my old job back at the bar/restaurant that’s a 12-minute walk from my house, things are looking up for a change.

I just wanted to say farewell to my favorite community on the entire Internet.  Ya’ll are SO supportive of each other; at times I’ve wanted to reach through my phone screen and hug you motherfuckers.  Please stay safe out there, the opiates memorial subreddit has way too many posts.

Much love to the lurkers, mods, shitposters, dope porn fiends, and to those of you that somehow can still come here even though you’re clean.  I’d like to become one of the latter, focusing on harm reduction if possible, but miraculously I never switched over to the needle.

It’s been a long (almost) decade.  I need to retire before I OD for the first time, which almost happened a few months ago.  Hopefully I can still come here and be a smartass and advise people about when it’s okay to take suboxone after their last shot, or give pointers on kratom.

Now if people are going to continue to use something that they know could be dangerous, they owe it to themselves to be as safe as possible. ODs happen because there are no stardizations in potency, and this is especially true today on the streets. However, risk can be minimized through my friends solutions and dilutions. 

There are right ways to dilute things and wrong ways. The reason so many people die is because of the latter. 

While, as a user, you don't have control over the intelligence of others, you can minimize your risk of OD drastically and systymatically.

Even if the fent cut is applied properly, it is best to always assume it could very well be deadly. That is to say you should assume every powder contains various hotspots and varying potencies.

Now know it or not, it's possible you could already be very familure with dilution processe(s). When people dissolve compounds(solute) in solution(solvent like water) this a dilution. Essentially you are making a more concentrated product into to something more uniform and diluted. This is where the safety, metaphorical, key lies.

Note: this assumes the fent or analogues are in the hydrocloride salt form. It's also important to note that this will not cause you to lose any product or have any negative effects. It is in you best interest.

The thing that people do wrong, when performing their personal dilutions, is that they are diluting with far too little solvent. Safe practices include: 

And btw, preferably you need a couple oral syringes (1ml, 5ml, 10ml) and some marked, sealed containers (like water bottles), but this can be done without precision, because it is a dilution. That's to say you can dilute the water by eye; doubling the water volume each time.

-In order to minimize the variation in dosing, all of your product needs to be applied to a large volume of solvent (water).
-I cannot give you exact amounts because each will have varying strength, in addition to tolerance 
-you could end up with a few very weak solutions, however nothing is lost, water can be evaporated off, and it's better than death.

1. Cover your solute (powder) completely with water (inside container). It is important that you are doing this to the entirety of your purchase. Now shake / wait until complelty disolved. If you don't have precise measuring tools, go with a larger volume over a smaller one. This first container is your ×1 potency baseline.

2. If you have the precision, measure the volume of liquid. (Oral syringes are very precise; the smaller the better, measuring cups are not very precise; but better than nothing). Take 1/4 the liquid out from the first container and add it to the second container. Add the same volume of liquid that was in the first container, to the 2nd container.

3. Repeat step 2 as needed. But step 3 should be within safety margins (tread carefully). If so e correctly this should be 1/16 the potency of the the first bottle. Now test your solutions with an oral syringe. Going by .1 ml incriments, and tolerating up your dose until you find the right active dosage for you as an individual. You can then convert your remaining solutions to the desired potencily.

Went a little overboard this month, and it's guaranteed I am going to run out of opiates about 10-12 days before my next refill...

I REFUSE TO BREAK THE LAW, and I am going to enter WDs in a few days, what steps can I legally take to avoid the WDs? I honestly could care less if I get high, I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day. What are my legally-viable options for completely avoiding the WDs?

- Urgent care? Obviously urgent care wont give me more opiates, nor should urgent care give me more opiates. Would there be any reason to visit an urgent care?

- Emergency room? Several months ago a nurse at my pain clinic told me if I ever lose my opiates while traveling, I should visit the ER. I never did ask the nurse why I would visit the ER first, but that was the recommendation of a nurse at my pain clinic. If I visit an ER while in the middle of WDs what can I expect from the typical ER? What would an ER even do for me? Once again, I am not looking for more opiates. I dont want to get high. I just need to avoid the WDs until the beginning of May so I can work each day.

Contact my pain clinic? If so, what do I tell them? ""Oh by the way, I took more of my meds than I am suppose to, and ran out of my meds too quickly, can you help me with the WDs?"" Such a statement to my pain clinic sounds like a horrible idea. So, if I contacted my pain clinic, what should I tell them? I've been going to the same pain clinic for a couple of years, and I've never made a strange request from them before. I have a good relationship with my pain doctor.

What other suggestions do you have for someone to legally avoid WDs who is going to come up short by about 10 ten days before they get their meds legally filled again?

A few things to note:
- I have an ample supply of klonazapam, ativan and xanax available to me, although I have a high tolerance to all three.

- I have a large supply of lyrica.

Make no mistake though, I am going into WDs in a few days.  The above drugs may help around the edges, but I need to find a legally-viable way to completely avoid the WDs so I dont lose my damn job!  Any and all recommendations will be greatly appreciated.  :)",1524047235.0

- imodium (loperamide)
- source to cop more benzos and subs and stims

Help me schedule when to start my subs out (if i run out, i have source to get street subs so it's ok with the limited supply) and gather resources and check if i'm missing anything i can easily get before i get uber sick, because that bun and a half i did is holding me off right now, I'm surprisingly not physically sick yet, at least not to the noticeable amount where I start complaining.

I wish I can go to a medically supervised detox setting inpatient program. I can't cause my permanent residence status is not yet granted so I don't have any insurance nor am eligible for any. I just simply cannot afford it financially anymore to support me and my wife's habit and since my wife left to detox, I'm going to be kicking this alone at home.

Oh, and my 2 class C felony for CPCS (criminal possession of controlled substance) dropped down to Class A misdemeanors and has been put on ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal) so what that means is it's all going to get dismissed in September if I don't get arrested until then. It was for my legal prescription from south korea, but the state troopers couldn't identify that it was mine cause they couldn't read korean and tell that it was a legal prescription, so they charged me with felonies and i had to spend time in jail after that through thanksgiving cause I needed the judge to be present to get bailed out and the bail was posted the day court was closed for thanksgiving. That's just an update since I remember posting about it a few months ago but back then it was still felony charges. How stupid.

This compound was sold under the name of 2-Me-MAF; a close relative of another potent fentanyl analogue which had recently been banned in China, known as methoxyacetylfentanil or MAF. At first the users reported it to be similar to MAF in potency and euphoria, just another of many delicious analogues available to opioid RC enthusiasts. Ten thousand strong doses for less than a hundred dollars.  

A couple more months passed and suddenly there were reports of the new batches of 2-Me-MAF being unlike those previous. Some wouldn't dissolve in water. Some had no effect at all. Many users reported their product did have an effect: a horrific and stimulating psychedelic trip, probably courtesy of kappa receptor agonism. Our beloved mu-opioid receptor mediates euphoria and gives us reason to throw our lives away for heroin, while its sister the kappa-opioid receptor mediates dysphoria. One user had their order of 2-Me-MAF sent off a toxicology lab to be quantified; the result confirmed the sole presence of 2-methyl-methoxyacetylfentanil.  Perhaps the euphoric batches of 2-Me-MAF had in fact been old MAF stock, too valuable to just be thrown away when the government prohibited its manufacture. Who knows.  

Onwards to my question: it's old news that fentanyl analogues can be purchased through Chinese wholesalers. Low-level dealers are aware of this, and I assume 2-Me-MAF has already made its way to the street as an aduterant in heroin, terrorizing everyone it meets.

Now we are both (mostly) sober. We still smoke weed and drink occasionally, and we both hang out and drink Kratom sometimes, but my family is NOT comfortable with me being near him. They fear that I will relapse and die. 
I feel like I owe him the respect to not just abandon him. He is my best friend, after all. Is my family right? Would it be healthy to just drop him and stop speaking to him at all?
Thanks y'all",1524036122.0

Not sure if anyone else experiences this, but I have been using oxy/xanax for months, and recently have been seeing dark spots develop on my face, mainly inbetween my eyes on the bridge of my nose. 

They basically come after I black out/take alot of both xans and oxy. They start out looking like sun burns and develop into dark spots since I am darker skinned. I have a streak above my eyebrow since October that will not go away. Another streak went away and it was symmetrical to the one that has not gone away.

Any creams or solutions to get rid of these skin problems? After a binge my nose is peeling and my skin looks like shit with these dark splotches. Anyone else experience this?",1524035733.0

I can't stop listening to his music lately. I'm in that sober phase where music is so powerful and emotional. I'm a musician anyway and when I'm high I let the music die. It's sad. 

Yet I know I'll be going back. I hate being hooked but I don't hate heroin. Visiting reality from time to time is nice though. It's like seeing an old friend or hearing a song that takes you back to one single memory of childhood. But my dance with the devil isn't over.

8d3ctu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8d3ctu/a_trip_on_the_7_train/,15,https://redd.it/8d3ctu,doobiousdoob,A trip on the 7 train.,"I’m sick as a dog it took me forever to get to the subway even tho it’s a short 10 minute walk, it felt like a life time. I meet my girl at the subway transfer from the n to the 7  to pick up money. I had Venmod her money so she could take it out of the bank for Me, long ago my accounts had been charged off after I Over drew them into oblivion.  She wanted to know what it was for...she doesn’t know I use heroin and I came up with a corny excuse I think she bought it but I didn’t care at that moment if she did or didn’t. She didn’t kiss me goodbye when we went our separate ways...I knew she was mad and I don’t blame her. But I can’t even begin to deal with that now...I have one thing on my mind...getting on that 7 train. 

I was lucky enough to catch an express...2 stops instead of 8. I still had a 20 minute walk after I got off and that’s walking at a normal pace which I was not...It was an 8 minute ride from start to finish it felt like a decade but finally my train dropped me off at my desired location. I was so close but still so far away.  A one mile walk sick  I would never make it. My legs were cramping my nose was dripping and I was sweating but freezing all at once.

I begrudgingly walked down the steps of the platform to the street below. Taxis lined the street waiting for a customer. I counted my money and decided fuck it I’m taking a taxi. 35 minutes turned into 4 and all of a sudden sweet relief was walking its way towards me with a grin on its face. My cabby was waiting around the corner for me.  I knew I could walk it back, once I was well it wouldn’t be the slightest issue but it was still cold out and I just wanted to get back to my 7 train. 

Just like that I was walking back to the cab rolling the bundle between my fingers. I find it funny that until i get these little baggies up my nose I will not relinquish my grip on the bundle, it’s not to leave my hand until I start to open them. I hop back in the car and tell my cabby to take me back to the train. I lay my phone out and immediately start opening and pouring 4 bags out. I move them into 3-4 lines, grab the straw from my pocket never being more careful than I was at that moment not to spill my
Precious cargo laid out on the screen of my phone. Day in and day out bags poured out onto my phone waiting for me to put them up my nose.  

In an instant I feel 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 110, 200% better. as each second passes my body returns to normal. It’s actually kind of sad.  My cabby asks me if I just bought weed as I clean up my supplies in his back seat. I laugh and simply say “No, I wish man I wish.” If only it were as simple as weed. 

We make it back to the subway and I pay my partner in crime who  I volunteered without his knowledge. I thank him for the ride and exit the car.  Gone are the sweats and the muscle cramps and I’m not even cold any more as I have that amazing fire burning on the inside keeping me warm. Just as my other symptoms immediately subsided my appetite quickly returned and i decided to spend my last $2 on 2 shitty McDonald’s cheeseburgers... but alas the 7 train awaited me.  The climb up the stairs this time was effortless I could have taken them 2 at a time if I desired but I decided to walk like a normal person. There would Be no express train on the return trip. As it only runs express towards the city during the morning commute. This time it would be 10 stops back but for all I cared it could have been 100 stops. As the train pulls away I don’t focus on each and every stop like I did on the way here. Now I allow my self to become consumed in my phone and before you know it I’m back where I had met my girl an hour prior... as I boarded the N and headed towards my Final destination 5 stops to go, feeling so much better than I did on my way. i couldn’t help but look across the tracks imagining sick me coming back this way only an hour prior. The difference was astounding. And it Instantly disgusted me. My daily trips on the 7 train. Heading out sick and heading home happy.  I can’t get over that, and  it eats at me, atleast it does for now. Until tomorrow when I head out sick going from the N to the 7 to a taxi and back all over again.  I feel like this is my own personal  groundhogs day. And there seems to be no escape. Until tomorrow 7 train. Until tomorrow 

 
(This was my first attempt at writing a story I hope it was ok and possibly entertaining for atleast one of you. I know I always enjoyed people’s stories about picking up. So i decided I would share it. Hope u guys enjoy)

Here are some things to remember about heroin/fentanyl dope mix:

* You can purchase fentanyl test strips at [this site for $10.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/) They detect the presence of even the smallest amount of fentanyl and they will detect a good number of the fentanyl analogues as well. Is your life worth $10? You can't get high again if you are dead!

* There is no way you can be sure the powder you have been given does not contain fentanyl without testing, and there is no simple, fool proof method for checking it yourself besides the [linked test strips.](https://dancesafe.org/product/fentanyl-test-strips-pack-of-10/)

* Just because it looks, smells, tastes, and is chunky like good clean heroin doesn't mean there is not fentanyl in it and that it's not deadly.

* Be aware of pills that you are buying as well, it is getting more and more common to see numerous imprints of pills that are being counterfeited with an unknown amount of fentanyl in them. There are some very good fakes going around out there that will fool even the most seasoned pill user.

* Just because there is not a warning in your area it does not mean there is not fentanyl tainted dope around. Be safe, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

* Be safe, be smart, start small, use with a friend, have Narcan on hand, and **do test shots!**

For the past 3 almost 4 years now, I've been able to keep my habit well under control. I only do pills (oxy and tramadol) as heroin is a much more slippery slope. I'm only 20 and as of recently I am now basically the boss at my great paying job meaning I am in charge of guys almost double my age because no one works even close to as hard as I do. I had my first few experiences with PK's when I was a sophomore in highschool. One of the kids in our stoner friend group had some sort of muscular atrophy condition I believe it was so he was always had a ridiculous amount of pills he would hand out to us like candy. The first few times I tried hydro and oxy it was fun but nothing I would go out of my way to get. It wasn't until a few years later that I tried again that my love for opis really started. I used to be a huge stoner because it would work wonders for my anxiety and depression up until I had a full blown nightmare acid trip. Ever since, weed has been ruined and that was about 4 years ago now. I do use them everyday after work. It might sound dumb but I have a personal rule where I won't get high until 5:00 or later if I'm still at work. I never work while high. I redose once at 8:00 or 9:00 and will very rarely redose for a second time. I never go more than a few weeks at a time without taking a tolerance break so that I don't become too physically dependent. I don't enjoy any other drug at all really and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon.

It may not sound funny and it may actually sound damn near mean, but I think its funny how people can look over obvious clues (that I educated them about) and not know I am using. 

When I get itchy from heroin, I even say, ""I'm getting itchy again, must be the heroin."" and they just laugh like I am just joking, or when I go to buy my heroin, I straight up say, ""well, I gotta eat breakfast first, get my heroin, then I can pick you up.""

Maybe it's my way of convincing myself I am not lying to them to not feel guilty, idk. Does anyone else do this or joke about their use?

So I am a trained phlebotomist which if you don’t know is somebody that taps veins and draws blood all day long. Below is a list of tips you should ALWAYS follow when shooting to preserve your veins, heart, and avoiding infection. 


CLEANLINESS/ STAYING STERILE:

Before beginning your session, always make sure that your hands are WASHED CLEAN and that the area that you will be having your substances and rigs is clean as well. 
Please I cannot stress this enough, use a brand new needle every time. Do not ever share needles with anybody else as well.  You can purchase them on Amazon as I’ve been told and other places ESPECIALLY veterinarian websites online in bulk for cheap. Some states actually allow you to purchase them for insulin without a prescription. There’s no reason you should be using dull needles.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab, rub the swab in a circular motion for 15 seconds. It should be 70% alcohol or higher.

MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS MICRON FILTERS They are very cheap online and they are lifesavers. No excuse to not have them! They will SAVE your limbs and we all like those don’t we? 
THESE ARE ESSENTIAL!!!


 NEEDLES:

Use a new needle every single time if you can as the sharper the needle, the less tissue damage but if you absolutely cannot, then use it only up to 4 to 5 times tops if your budget is tight. This is because the duller the needle gets, the more damage and scarring it will cause to your veins that is irreparable and nobody WANTS track marks. This is KEY to keeping your skin and veins in as good as a condition as you can while shooting. You wouldn’t even know I shot by the looks of my arms. 

If you do reuse a needle rinse it and sterilize it if possible you can boil them in hot water on the stove. If you cannot boil it, make sure you thoroughly rinse it and store it with the cap on in a sterile place. Bleach is just as effective if not more!! May even be as easier option to you depending on your circumstance. 

Use the smallest gauge needle that you possibly can. This will obviously cause the least amount of damage and frankly pain.

And obviously before administration, make sure all air bubbles are removed my tapping the side of the syringe and pushing the remaining air out with the plunger.

FINDING A VEIN:

Stay away from veins in your feet, 

Constantly rotate the sites that you use. It is not smart to keep going up or down a vein a half an inch and shooting multiple times in that area. You should let it rest and use a different spot.

Try to use your ante cubital which is the center vein in the ditch of your arm. If not, use any vein that is large and easily accessible. 

Veins feel like a garden hose. They should be a little bouncy to the touch. You should palpate for a vein with just one finger. Once you have found a good one it’s time to get blood flowing into that arm so you can tourniquet it. 

When tourniquetting, the rule of thumb is *4-6 inches* above the injection site. Make it so that you can remove the tourniquet while injecting. I do this by having the end of it in my mouth or having a belt wrapped around under my thigh and up and over my arm and doing it that way. This is important so that you can relieve pressure before you take the needle out. 

Make sure the bevel of the needle which is the pointed opening is FACING UPWARDS!!
This is proper practice and less damaging to veins. 
In other words when you are putting the needle into your skin, you should be able to see the opening of the needle. It should be facing the sky so that the most pointed part of the needle is inserted first.

If you think you are in a vein and did not register, DO NOT DIG AROUND!!
 Pull the needle completely out, get the air out, and attempt again. I CANNOT stress this enough!! This causes major scarring and damage to your veins and it is called raking. NO GOOD. 
Think of it as taking a knife and cutting up your veins. Don’t do it because you think it will be quicker. Eventually you won’t be able to use that site because of practices like this.

If you are using veins on your forearm that tend to roll you can use your tourniquet above the site as well as one below to keep the vein from rolling or if you have a friend, they may apply pressure to the other side as well with two fingers. 

Drinking water will help keep your veins open and more easily accessible so make sure to drink water and keep hydrated always. This is honestly a huge huge tip especially for people with smaller veins and people that don’t drink enough water. Even after one day you will see a difference. 



SHOOTING:

Once you have registered, pull back slowly (this is important) and inject an amount, register again and pull the plunger back to make sure you are STILL in the vein and finish the injection. This is also a ridiculously important part. You will be able to feel if you are not in the vein. It will have a slight resistance to the injection and tends to burn or hurt. You are highly unlikely to get an abscess if you register a couple times ensuring that you are in the vein as well as following the cleanliness steps. 

As you are pushing the plunger in for the last injection, you should be removing the tourniquet at this point. You MUST leave the needle in before you take the tourniquet off so that pressure is not shooting towards the injection site. This WILL cause bruising and hematomas. 

AFTER THE SHOT:

Once you have removed the tourniquet, slowly remove the needle and have a paper towel or tissue ready to place MODERATE pressure on the site for a least a minute. This will prevent brusing. 

** A COMMON MISCONCEPTION **
DO NOT BEND YOUR ARM IF YOU INJECTED IN THE DITCH RIGHT AFTER. HOLD YOUR ARM STRAIGHT UP WITH APPLIED PRESSURE.
Bending your arm actually opens up the small puncture you made in the vein more as the vein moves. 

Put on a bandaid with a fresh piece of rolled up paper towel under it so it applies pressure for an hour or so and enjoy your high! 

If you experience any bruising after despite these tips and steps you can use an Arnica cream that will overtime reduce the bruises quicker than normal although you shouldn’t have so much as a red dot if you followed these steps! 

SORRY FOR THE LENGTH! But this stuff is all so important guys. You literally cannot even tell I shoot up because of these practices. Enjoy guys! And PLEASE me know if you have any questions. I am more than happy to help you guys out with being safe. Message me anytime.

Right now when someone submits a fent warning we lock the post and 'sticky' it to the top of the page. This system used to work really well back when the vast majority of heroin was.....HEROIN! and not the other way around, as we can only have 2 things 'stickied' at once and we might have 3-4 warnings in one day.

There will now just be one post stickied to the top of the sub titled 'Fentanyl warnings and information' or something similar to that. Inside this post there will be some information that is common sense to some, and valuable to others; like where to purchase fent test strips, signs of fentanyl dope, and other stuff like that. There will also be all of the fentanyl warnings that have been submitted to us listed from most recent and getting older.

**You guys will still submit the fentanyl warnings the same way that you have been** and we will continue to lock them, but they will be compiled, linked to, and organized inside this one post at the top of the sub. There will also be some additional features added like searchable flair and some other little things.

If anyone has any questions or comments feel free to leave them here and we will address them. Thanks folks!

A time about two months ago when I was dealing with this fuckboy named Coby who was a meth head.

For the first couple times, I got hooked up straight, I guess now that was to lure me in.  I never had to wait, I never got slacked and the shit was always fire.

Within a week the bags were getting slacker, the dope shittier and I'd have to wait upwards of three hours just to score a shit, slack point of bap.

To top it off, this motherfucker wouldn't answer the phone half the time.  I ended up having to buy overpriced blues in the interim and texted him telling him that he had lost a $300 play.

He texted me back with ""money doesn't make me move"".

I broke off all contact with him after that and continued to buy overpriced blues until I got a solid connection that is ALWAYS fat and I come to them, not the other way around.  No waiting or any bullshit.

And the DOPE IS FIRE ASF.
