Life is so bland and boring.,"I had a back surgery in June that was supposed to be so simple with a short recovery time.  Well, recovery took about 3 months longer than expected, and it only helped my pain about 50% (was supposed to completely eliminate the pain).  My doctor continued to prescribe Norco for me at my request.  I was taking up to 40mg a day for the back pain, and a yet-undiagnosed condition, possibly fibromyalgia.  I NEVER took it to get high.  I only took the minimum to control the pain.  I started getting worried when I would take 10mg, and that didn't help, then another 10mg about 45 min later, and STILL it wasn't helping.  I knew my body was building up a tolerance and that road wasn't going to end well.  

I SLOWLY tapered and took my last 10mg almost exactly a week ago.  I was able to increase the gabapentin with doctor approval and the transition has been relatively lower pain than expected.  The pain has spiked really bad several times over the last week.  Those times I reached for the Norco, but then looked at it and thought ""you really weren't helping me with my pain, so why would I take you again.""

So now the hydro is out of my body, the pain is for the most part manageable, but and I find life......bland and boring.  I went from peaks of ""I want to talk to everyone and give them a big hug"" about 30-60 minutes after taking a Norco, to now a neutral level, which sucks.   I'm so quiet now people are asking if I am OK (particularly the ones that have never know the non-hydro version of me).

I do NOT feel like throwing myself off a bridge or anything like this.  Just no motivation to do work or even non-work things that interest me.  I have been drinking HUGE amounts of tea (caffeine) with no real effect (compared to how hydro would make me).  Is this normal for life-after-hydro?  How long, if ever, until I feel ""normal"" again?  

I'm not interested in taking kratom, marijuana, or anything else.  Although marijuana may be helpful for the autoimmune condition that is going on, I cannot take marijuana because of my job.  ",1518033078.0

I have 6 left and i don't think 3 is enough. 4 or 5 would leave with leftovers. So i want to take em' all.

so the plan is 30mg oxy, along with some potentiators:
 25mg meclazine
200mg aleve
beef patty with cheese
grapefruit juice
15 ml dayquil

Fresh out of three weeks of treatment, got high twice in the past week but I'm hanging on.  I'm putting all types of barriers between me and the block but reality is daily I still want to get high and it's a struggle.  I'm losing and have lost all the things that really matter to me.  Deep down I do want to stay clean it's just the daily struggle that trips me up.  Anyway if you're withdrawaling now or in the early days/months of recovery it could always be worse.

Story goes like this...I had recently been arrested, lost like my 8th apartment and was stuck moving back in with my folks who were still together at the time for like the tenth time in a 6-7 years.  My dad's the controlling type but really cares and what's to find whatever would work for me.  Now I had been on n off the Vivitrol shot for a couple years at this point.  Before this latest attempt at getting clean my parents said I wasn't living there unless I was on it.  So not being built for hovering over candles in the bando (I've been there too) I agreed.  I was on a pretty vicious year or so long run at this point.  I agreed to check in to detox and thought I'd be fine with just that cuz my family was going to the shore the following week.  That week-10 days would get the methadone taper out of my system and be good for the shot.  Well instead of staying clean that week I decided to drive to Kensington every single day to get high and came back to the shore like nothing happened.  I did this for the next seven days.  On the day of the shot my ex and I drove separate from my dad back home to get the shot.  He had to witness me get it or wouldn't believe me.  So I figured this is gonna suck but I don't wanna be homeless I'm gonna get it regardless.  Then as we're driving down the expressway I thought hell I got high the past 7 days what's the difference if I get high 45 minutes before this thing, might as well relax till I get there.  So I lost my dad in traffic stopped in the hood, got high and proceeded to the office, arriving like ten minutes after my dad.  I went in pissed hot, they made me sign a waiver saying I was gonna get really sick.  I signed it and got the shot.

Worst mistake of my life.  People talk about precipitated withdrawal from subs, I've been there, it's that times 1000.  I got five minutes from the office with my girl driving and instantly started throwing up till it was bile then dry heaving.  My anxiety and hot n cold sweats were so bad I was kicking the windshield.  I never contemplated suicide till that moment.  I almost threw myself into traffic.  I told my girl to turn around and take me to the hospital.  The hospital sat me in a wheelchair and took my blood pressure. ""Oh it's raised a little bit, wait here""  Hunny I don't have time to wait I wanna die, shoot me up with some ativan or thorizine or I'm out.  They didn't like that.  I called my Dr. who just gave me the shot n said I had no idea it'd be this bad you gotta fill me a script of something.  He called in a script of 15 librium.  I know librium, I took 12 of the 15 at once on a completely empty stomach.

Now it was time to drive back to the shore.  But wait I'm gonna be out of librium in another hour what then?  I told my girl yo you gotta stop in the hood I need xanax.  Next thing I remember she's hitting me not knowing where to cop bars.  I tell her and fade out.  I wake up on the bridge, tell her to turn around, I fade out again.  This went on for about another three times before I finally woke up down the shore with 0 librium left feeling like death.

The next five days were spent not moving from the couch, trying to down what little bit of bacardi n coke I could stomach and smoking as much weed as possible to take the edge off.

TLDR: Don't ever take the vivitrol shot unless you're pissing clean, no matter what the consequences.  Homeless would have been the far better option.  Moral is it could always be worse when you're withdrawaling, 90% of it is mental.  Just really hard to convince yourself that.",1518030869.0

The end. Tell me what you think of the poem at the end, I‚Äôm genuinely interested in feed back. 

I made all the classic mistakes, I let my money walk, I let my CAR walk at one point (it did come back though), I trusted the strange dude who my middle introduced me to instead of her when I knew she could be trusted. I bought his uncle beer? And then rented a room in my name that he barely used? He kept disappearing or sending me to go get someone instead of getting down to business which should have been obviously shady. He made himself out to be a trustworthy dude but he kept trying to make me doubt my middle (call her K), should have been wary of that. Everything took like 3 or more hours to get nothing done. Wasted a lot of gas and in the end I had no choice but to go home, leaving him with the money and her screwed over because she was gonna use the money I gave her for all this to flip some shit and make her way back home to Cali to see he husband. She showed me a picture of him. I know she‚Äôs trustworthy, she was dragging me all over the place trying to find them and my money before I had to go. She wanted to kill them. She was crying because she was screwed now but also in a mothering way because  I hadn‚Äôt listened and got fucked over. I set her up in the room the guy had me rent for the night though, got a new key. I gave her the cash I had left save what I needed for tolls to get home. She had taken the guys laptop as collateral against anything happening to me at one point, which has me concerned for her safety, though I didn‚Äôt get the impression these people were violent and she‚Äôs been homeless for like 10 years so she‚Äôs street smart but still. I told her to try and trade the laptop for the drugs and fuck it she can have half of them, but only if it wasn‚Äôt putting her in danger, otherwise she should just give it back, I don‚Äôt care about the money or the drugs at this point, just that she‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôm gonna try and help her get across country in time to see her husband for his birthday. I‚Äôm gonna buy her a below freezing sleeping bag that she needs. She read my palm and told me I‚Äôm very creative but that I don‚Äôt use it enough, I have a strong work ethic but I don‚Äôt apply it to my hobbies, that I‚Äôve had some trauma and it affected me greatly and that I have a complicated life, all true things. She said I was a pretty man, with a kick ass beard. People compliment my beard all the time but no ones ever called me pretty. I showed her the text I had gotten the night before from the woman I‚Äôm in love with who told me clearly, that though she values our friendship a lot, in the end the only people she ‚Äòneeds‚Äô are her husband and daughter, things I already knew deep down but didn‚Äôt want to admit to myself. She was sympathetic, and she advised I distance myself from her which is going to be so hard. She gave me a little gold plate of mother Mary for good luck even though she wasn‚Äôt Christian and I wasn‚Äôt catholic but we both agreed on the same opinion regarding organized religion. We also both learned our favorite candy is sour patch kids, go figure. She says we‚Äôre gonna be good friends, something she doesn‚Äôt really even believe in. I told her I believe in true friends but not that everyone will find true love, which she does believe because she has found it. We‚Äôre gonna be good friends. It was all over several scripts of lortabs and a g of heroin. I made a 3-1/2 round trip to get it and I don‚Äôt even know in the end if anyone even had it cause I never saw it. Anyways, now I gotta face the music with my parents cause I told them what happened. I broke down and got scared when I thought my car was gone and told them what happened. It was getting late enough that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stall for much longer and would have had to have had an explanation. More than anything they are happy I‚Äôm safe but there‚Äôs gonna be consequences, I don‚Äôt know what. 
Anyways, here‚Äôs a little poem I wrote the other night about the opiate experience after getting that text from Her that broke my heart and then getting high for the last time before I am now completely out of drugs, possibly for good. It‚Äôs probably overly melodramatic and inconsistent but whatever, I was high. 

The tin man was a fool:
From before the fall, it is that holy feeling we all search for; the orgasm in slow motion, the sunrise that brings light to the dark places and sends the shadows into retreat. Reminiscent of that moment before dawn, when everything was new. It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn‚Äôt ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you can almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in the sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven‚Äôt any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp that it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.

Losing weight is rough ever since I discovered opiates last January.  I barely eat due to appetite suppressant effects and neasea.  I went a month without weighing myself and using daily,  thinking I‚Äôll see a low number once I do..I didn‚Äôt lose anything,  heart crushed..major disappointment.  I ate only at night, some fruit, egg whites and cereal usually.  Opiates also give me energy,  walking is fun while high.  

I‚Äôm starting to count calories very recently..yesterday I had serving broccoli, egg whites with cream cheese.  That‚Äôs it..and some coffee creamer.  I didn‚Äôt lose. 

On a side note,  my opiate of choice doesn‚Äôt cause constipation.  I go several times in morning. 

I hate being sober,  the rush is only thing I look forward to.  Totally non functional without opiates.  

Idk I woke up shaking, blacking out and weak..stepped on scale..nothing.  

It was so easy before.  I didn‚Äôt have to be so strict and when I tried,  I seen results right away.

I‚Äôm at a lowish weight already so counting calories is necessary.  I‚Äôll continue and see where it gets me.

You can look at my user history if you wanna see that....its currently in the works. Until then, I've really enjoyed reading some of your stories, so I though I would share one of mine. 

I moved to Ukraine from the good Ol' USA a few years ago, just to get away from it all basically live a simple, work free life on the gov't check I was getting. So let me set the stage for you all.

I'm Hetmen. Ex-American soldier, who moved to his mothers homeland of Ukraine. I have quite a bit of family here and spend almost all my time with them. Typically they spend 3 to 6 months in a western country working construction (men) or as a nanny/live in nurse (women) then come back for about 6 months before they take off again. Me? I just drink and use everyday, babysit for family, help in the garden...basically chill. 

So my cousin, Oleg, gets this idea, he decides hes gonna rent out a little place, buy some video gambling machines and start a business..... As you can expect, the business doesn't work out on account of the fact that people have no fucking money to gamble with. Ahhhh, but where did Oleg get the start up money from? None other then the Ukrainian Mafia. I figure this is not my or my family's problem, surely Oleg will figure it out. Well, Oleg suddenly goes to Prague to work (this was over 3 years ago). 

A few month go by and I'm at my other cousin Lana's house just crushing some vareniki in her apartment when we hear the buzzer on her door go off. She picks up the phone to see who it is and a look of fear washes over her face. She says its the mafia guys looking for Oleg. She tells me they've come twice now looking for him. 

Me, being pretty high, drunk and full of dumplings, say I'll go down to talk to them. So I walk down to the entrance of her building and there are two normal looking guys in their mid twenties.

I ask them, in English, ""Whats up guys? Why are you bothering my cousin Lana while her husband is away (he was working in Lithuania) . They both looked at each other and smiled, then one, we'll call him Taras, says, ""Ohh so you are Oleg's Cousin. He said he had an American. You're the Cowboy."" I had no idea what this dude was talking about but I just went with it because I thought being called cowboy was kinda cool. Taras said ""Your cousin, Oleg, owes us about 270,000 Hryvnia"" (about 10,000 USD). I said  ""Yeah man that is a lot of money, but you need to find Oleg to get your money back, not his family, or friends because we had nothing to do with that bullshit. Last I heard he was in Prague, so maybe check there?"" I had quite a bit of liquid courage in me. Taras says ""Cowboy, in the United States, $10,000 is worth a shit car. Here, in Ukraine, its worth an entire life."" Now me, being drunk at the time didn't know that this dude was straight up threatening someones life, so  I was like ""yeah dude its a lot of money, good luck finding that dipshit"" 

I'll post part two about what the mafia guys did and how we got them their....Compensation.... if there is interest. happy nods friends. ",1518017032.0

Shit post, but I just have to get this out.","I haven‚Äôt told this to **anyone** yet, maybe some of you can give me some insight. I‚Äôve been floating around this sub for almost a year. I‚Äôm not a huge poster or commenter, but a few of you may remember me as the chick that has been on dialysis forever, opiates even longer, have myself endocarditis from shooting into my dialysis fistula and now my husband keeps my med looked in a safe. He gives them out daily and I save my roxys and Xtampzas up for a week and have happy time on weekends (I don‚Äôt shoot anymore). 

I was finally put on the transplant list a month ago after being on dialysis for eight years. I had hoped to have my surgery by the end of this year. That‚Äôs why I was shocked to get a call yesterday from my coordinator saying they had a possible match. I was surprised it was so fast, but so happy. Then she told me the kidney was from a young adult, was a match for my blood type and the person had never had any major illnesses or surgeries. It sounded good. Then, the coordinator said ‚ÄúThe kidney cannot be classified as completely healthy. The person was exposed to HIV and/or Hep‚Äù. She told me they had run and rerun several tests and they had come back negative. It was showing that it was perfectly healthy. But, it couldn‚Äôt be listed as healthy. I turned it down and began the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù and the ‚Äúwas I right?‚Äù  

I knew that because I had only been on the transplant list for a month that I was not the first (or probably in the first 20) person they called. The more I thought about it, the more things I realized. 

The donor was a very young adult and the coordinator said that the kidney had not been in any major accidents (of course she couldn‚Äôt specify and probably shouldn‚Äôt have even told me that). But, the HIV/Hep designation would come from IV drug use. And then, because I knew the donor was not living, I realized that this was most likely an OD. I called my Nephrologist‚Äôs office and spoke to his nurse. She said that I was probably going to get many calls about potential matches with HIV/Hep kidneys from OD‚Äôs and that I needed to wait for a healthy kidney. She said the numbers of these types of donor kidneys (OD khave gone steadily up over the past five years. She told me that it would not be held against me to pass on these types of kidneys, especially because I am young and even the healthiest in transplanted kidneys only last for 20 years at the most. 

Last night I began to feel awful. This young person had made the decision to give the most wonderful gift of organ donation. Or, this person‚Äôs heart broken parents made an incredible choice to donate their son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs organs. Either way, the family wanted to help another person have a new life through this amazing sacrifice. And now, so many of us were turning it down. 

I never knew this person, I knew nothing about them. But I found myself thinking about what kind of life they had. What kind of things did they like? What kind of music, movies and food? Why did they start shooting? Were the alone and sad? My heart was heavy because I wished I could thank them for their incredible donation. I wanted to tell the family what a wonderful and brave gift they had given. I actually began to cry when I thought about the mom (I‚Äôm a mom myself and I couldn‚Äôt imagine how hard this must be) and Dad must be going through. üòî

Although the situation surrounding the death of this young person might be something other than an OD from IV drugs, it‚Äôs unlikely after putting together all the facts. I will get many potential matches from OD deaths. It is heartbreaking to me. I just want everyone to stay safe, keep narcan on hand, and party with a buddy. This sub is awesome!",1518014840.0

Just a bit of a background info. My husband and I live in the city. Our house has an alley behind it, and there‚Äôs a house that‚Äôs caddy corner from our driveway. The caddy corner house shields our driveway from the road. Well, I guess two people decided our driveway would be the perfect place to shoot up. 

Now, onto the situation. My husband was taking our dog outside, and he saw the car. The car was off, so my husband walked up to it. While walking up to the car, he noticed cigarette butts which he took to mean they‚Äôd been there for a while. Inside, he saw two men sleeping. The driver was bleeding from three different pricks in his arm. My husband tried to wake up the driver, and he would not wake up. The driver only woke up after my husband had our dog bark. The driver woke up, turned the car on, and sped off.

I get the backpack and remember that her girlfriend just so happened to lose some football cards worth thousands of dollars awhile back. Strange, right? 

I go through the backpack this morning to find them and to verify that they are in fact her girlfriends. Turns out her mom moved the cards, so I didn't find those, I did however find my own mothers debit card, my bank card, and a couple other items of mine with value. My legs became weak and my ears started ringing. I tell her girl what's up. A little while after she called me from jail asking if I found the cards and when I can bail her out. I tell her as far your girl and I are concerned, you died in jail. After everything we've done for your thieving ass. Go fuck yourself.

We have to be very careful what content and discussion that we allow on this subreddit if we want it to stick around for another 8 years.

We have the rules that are in the sidebar for very good reasons, most of them are pretty obvious: the longevity of this community, your safety, right to not be harassed, legal reasons, and so forth. Our major concerns at this current time are sourcing and locations issues, these have been identified as *the* reasons that these other subreddits have been shut down. Our job as moderators is hard enough as it is, we ask that everyone follows the rules to the best of their abilities at all times.

I am going to clearly define when you can post something about your location.

* **Countries** are always acceptable to speak about.

* **Large regions** are always okay. e.g. Great Lakes, New England, southwest.

* **States** are *not* acceptable when talking about dope porn or not being able to find a connect. They are okay when talking about harm reduction issues or very general topics.

* **Cities** are **never** allowed unless it is a fentanyl warning, the post will then be moderated accordingly.

* **Streets** are **never** acceptable.

* **Neighborhoods** are **never** acceptable.

* **GPS coordinates** - you work for the NSA and you are a cop, never acceptable.

-----

**Sourcing**

From the sidebar:

> No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. 

I feel like that is very clear. If it needs clarified any further, this is the time and the place.

----

We want this community to stick around, there is not another one like it. I know many people would be devastated to lose it and the relationships they have built, so we all need to work together. There is the report button that is below every post and below every comment, please use it when necessary. We have many systems in place to help us deal with these problems, but we don't see everything.

People that break the rules will be dealt with accordingly. Most all of the people that post here regularly are super awesome and follow all the rules all the time, it is just that 1% that can take this place away from us.

Thanks for your time, help, and understanding folks!

- Kick


----

FashionablyFake:

I also want to add, about locations: hinting about them is still not okay. If your goal is for someone else to be able to tell where you live, that's the same as naming the city itself.

No location-specific posts! This includes neighborhoods AND cities. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources. üê¢ üçÅ

I just feel like an asshole for all the encouraging words I used to leave on other people's posts and the advice I reached out for in other subs when trying to stay clean...and then I relapsed, but here we are and here I am. So I quit my job about a month ago because I was being dumb (yet again) but was able to get my job back and I start back tomorrow. WELLLL.... I went and took out a cash advanced (because I burned through my savings after quitting my job) so I could get straight two days ago. I figured I would just pay it back when I got paid, no biggie. I JUST realized that the cash advanced is due THE DAY of the next pay cycle at work (the 15th) and that I probably wont get put back into the system in time for me to get paid on the 15th...
So now I am sitting here, thinking I will probably have to pawn my laptop so I can get the money to pay the cash advanced so the check I wrote the C.A. place doesnt bounce.
But then the addict in me knows I will most likely take that pawn money and go get straight with it and not pay the cash advanced place at all...
Or maybe I can pay off the cash advanced and then get another one after paying that one?

7vqnlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vqnlf/using_subs_to_help_detox/,7,https://redd.it/7vqnlf,harea123,Using subs to help detox.,"So I have a couple of questions about using subs for detox and was wondering if anyone could help me out.

First a little bit of background, been using opiates on and off for about 3 years, with my using turning heavy in the last year. I will typically go on 2-4 week binges, withdraw and binge again. Before Christmas I overdid it with Tianeptine sulfate and experience awful withdrawals (I have heard it has some of the worst) thankfully I managed to make it through them, but it almost cost me my sanity. 

Of course after that I vowed never to take opiates again, just a bit of kratom so that I could enjoy New Years eve, and not be feeling to terrible as I settled into my new job. Well that obviously didn't last long and I've been abusing a long last opiate daily/once every 2 days for a month and a half (equivalent to maybe 300mg morphine or more). . I know a month is not a long time, but I haven't fully withdrawn from opiates in over 6 months. The longest I have gone without is a week but I wasn't out of withdrawals then. 


I am positively terrified of the withdrawals, I am very bad at handling them. I have heard of using subs to help minimize withdrawal I know I will have to pay the price, and feeling shitty is inevitable. But I would love it even if they made them 50% more bearable. 

So my questions are:

1) Does a quick sub taper help at all?

2) What dose and for how long should I take them?

3) Does it not just push the withdrawal back a couple of days?

But any information or experience from anyone who has used subs during detox would be appreciated. 

TLDR: Been abusing an opiate with a long half-life. Wondering if subs could help minimize withdrawal. Wondering how much to take/how long for. Thanks!",1517951534.0

So recently just moved out to California from New Jersey, back east they only have china white there, and out here I can only find tar. I've been getting high on and off for about 5 years now, and have been mostly an IV user. Never ever have I had an issue with shooting myself up, as I have great veins. But since moving out here I've been incredibly bad at hitting myself, and tend to miss my shots more than actually hitting. Which sucks, feels like such a fucking waste. I'm actually smoking the rest of my shit right now because I missed my shot. 

Was wondering if anyone has any pointers I guess? I'm so confused as to why I cannot hit myself, and am really tired of fucking missing constantly. Thanks ahead of time guys.",1517951417.0
7vqihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vqihd/in_regards_to_checking_for_fake_pills/,13,https://redd.it/7vqihd,dopiedude,In Regards to Checking for Fake Pills,"For those that ask, have you checked the search bar for what real ones should look like?  Call me crazy, but I feel like someone has come up with the idea of creating the guide of all guides to identify legit pills.  I could be wrong though.

All I'm saying is the general manner in which these posts are made are incredibly inefficient.  They may as well be spam at this point.  First off, any pill has the potential to be duplicated well enough to fool a trained eye.  It would actually be hazardous for someone to suggest your pill is legitimate just by looks alone.  We could only say in full faith that what you have is a real pill is if it were reagent tested, or straight from the pharmacy.  Also, not to mention most of the pictures users submit are blurry as shit, poorly lit, only a single side, etc.  The lack of elaboration on the pills other characteristics also prevents a more educated _guess_.  

So, I haven't looked myself because it wouldn't make sense for me to as a heroin  user, but if such a guide does not exist, we should put a comprehensive list of all available pills and make it a rule for users to check the list before making yet another redundant (or will be redundant when the guide is available) post on the subject.  

Another benefit would be that misinformation would less likely occur.  The guide could be revised, thus making it more trustworthy.

I've done a little bit of meth earlier, so this is just my two cents.  Of course still ask us if someone is unsure, but I'm sure the amount of these types of posts would be greatly reduced.

Thanks you for making it this far through my rant lol",1517950468.0

I know marijuana isn't the same, but I've never really done marijuana. My state will be all tinctures, edibles, and vape. No smoking.

So I guess my question is....how much recreational value does medical marijuana have? The reason for my thinking for the switch is my health. I've been looking for an out, and I think may be it. 

My abuse of oxycodone is a stress/anxiety relief function. And help with sleep. So will marijuana do the same for relaxing and sleep and pain relief

Never did heroin. 200mg a day oxy for 2 weeks, then benzos/Kratom for 2 weeks in a cycle.

Thanks guys. I release pretty stupid question, but I'm such a marijuana noob cause I could never smoke it

It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn‚Äôt ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in a sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven‚Äôt any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp so it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.

To me, Meth doesn't feel euphoric on its own, it only makes doing things much more fun. It increases the reward of things like playing video games or cleaning the house. Heroin you can just sit there in a chair and feel good but doing things also feels good. Heroin you can relax or do things. Meth will make you do something. Same with Dextroamphetamine.

Is this a bad path to go down. Are oxys as bad as everyone says it is.

How many percentage of users end up on heroin after oxys? (will never touch heroin or meth).

Have a good job, nice house and car, gym daily and beside weed dont touch anything else throughout the week.

Hi all, had a few questions to anyone who has BOC online. Basically, just set up a checkings today with BOC and just set up an online account too. I know with Chase bank, there is a lot of fraud prevention steps to logging on online. For example, a new computer needs verification by email or text. Also, for example if I use my debit card to make a purchase over $XXX Amount, it will send an email over, etc, stuff like that.

The lady today helping me set up the account told me I need a smart phone to use BOC online but can use it at the computer so I was wondering how similar it was to Chase online banking. Is BOC linked to the email address like if its my first time logging on at a location, will I need to verify with code? Can I set up text alerts without a smart phone? (Like placing a number on the account for protection, like BOC will send a text with a code to me if any log in problems), or anything like that? Or is it simply, use your email and password at any desktop/location and you can log in to view your banking information? 


Thank you anyone who took their time to read and/or respond. Have a good day!!!

=================== Random Opiate story that was promised.======================

===================================================

(First time buying crap Heroin when studying abroad)


I use to study abroad in China (Guangdong Province) a few years back. I was sent there originally to teach English but the program I signed up for didn't provide me with the ESL classes/certificates when I got there so didn't end up teaching. I had an addiction (heroin, but loved blues and opanas) problem back in the US, and Overdosed twice in the 2 months prior to going so my parents/aunt put money together and signed me up for a semester to learn Chinese to give myself time to get back to normal. They thought the strict laws there would deter people from selling and especially me from using. But during the first semester, I somehow managed to get myself into a bunch of shit and addicted to H again. What fucking shit.

About a month into the semester, I was with my friend Tack who was a skinny Indonesian kid with a bunch of tattoos and a funny looking face, he told me he met some new friends who were going to the club and asked me to go. A club was popular place to go among the foreigners. It was around 7pm and we went first to meet up with his new friends he met. So we got to their apartment, and what do you know, 2 Frenchman. They were 2 brothers, Tom and Arthur. Their apartment was very very nice and expensive, even for regular foreigners it was pricey. I say this because 1 USD = 6.1 RMB the time I was there and the USD just went farther making it seem like you are richer, but this apartment was nice is all I am saying. Anyways, both of them spoke English well, and Tom actually went to Cambridge University in England. Tom was also studying at the same school me and Indo Tack studied at but he was also there working in Finance in one of the big companies there (hence the expensive aprtment). His brother Arthur was in town visiting because it was his birthday. 

So we are pregaming at their place since they bought some Chinese beer (Tsingtao) and had a bottle of some liquor i never seen before. I'm not a drinker so i got buzzed pretty quickly. I pulled Tom aside and asked him how long he was there for and if he liked to party a lot. He told me he'll smoke weed every once in a while and even found people with weed in China. I was trying to slowly push his buttons to see if he fucked with opiates, but he told me back in England he did Coke a lot. Anyways, I was thinking to myself I would be fine with Coke. I've only done it a handful of times but I wanted to feel good that night and weed doesn't do it for me. So I asked him straight up if he had any contacts that could hook me up with something.


So he said yeah he has a connect there and gave me his guys number and told me to call him. I called him up and the guy has an accent made it more difficult to understand, I don't want to steriolize  but it was an African dude. It took a few tries but i asked him if he had Heroin after trying to beat around the bush, and he said yea he does and its $600RMB for a bag. I asked him if that was a gram or what? But he didn't understand me and I still to this day don't know how they measured out the bags. The 600 came out to around $95 or round up to $100 USD so I was expecting something good. He told me he'd be over there in 20-30 minutes. 


So i didn't exactly tell Tom what I was buying, I think he thought it was weed, and for sure, Tom's brother and my friend Indo Tack had no clue and they were waiting to leave to go to the club but I was waiting on the dealer so i kept saying just wait a little longer wait a little longer. I'm not sure how long it took but he finally came thru and by this time it was maybe 8 or 9pm and was pitch black outside. We just met on the street because there was no where private we could go, and i asked him let me see it first and he said okay. I pull out the bag and opened it up and dipped my finger in for a taste, and although it was dark out, he's like man becareful here. And to this day I have no clue what I got, I don't know if it was heroin or what. I didn't know about Reddit then or thought I would be buying more, so I never thought to take a picture and save for later. But the supposely heroin was kind of small chunks of soft clay like texture kind of in the letter C. It wasn't powder by any means, but it had that vinegarish smell and in a way tasted a little bit like H or what i can remember it tasted when I was back in the US. I asked him 3 times, what is this shit, and he kept saying yes man it's heroin, it's heroin. Because of the taste and just wanting to feel something, i bought it anyways. 


By now, Indo Tack, Tom and Arthur are outside and say cmon let's go to the club. So while we wait for a taxi, i tell them hold on and run to a public bathroom toilet quick to try and snort some of what i thought was heroin. Of course, there were no American style toilets in the bathroom, you have to squat to shit, So i had nothing to place my Dope on where i can crush it up and make lines etc. so i close the whole door on the bathroom and just use the sink and hope no one comes in. Anyways, so like i said before, the dope wasn't powder, it was this strange substance, I still don't know how to describe. Only if I saw it again I would be able to know. But I dump out a little bit and use my card to try and crush it up and cut out a line. The dope didn't really crush, like it was clay like and just got smooshed when i tried pushing it down. But the taste and the smell was just too similar to what I remember of H, so i kept trying at it. Eventually, shit breaks alittle bit but not into fine powder. It's kind of like bigger chunks but it's the best i could do with the time so I snorted it and went back out to catch the taxi with my friends. 

5 or 10 minutes pass and there was definitely something in that shit i bought. The feeling came on strong, a little euphoric, but not that much, but I was feeling something. I don't know if it was a placebo effect, but I swore I felt a small head rush like when you do a line, and then in a good mood after that. Since it did the job, i never questioned it and did hit up the dude a few times after that. (He came with powder after that which more resembled H then that first time shit). So we went to the club and got mad drunk and i told Tom and Arthur what i got and they asked for a line lol. I told them exactly what i told you guys, it wasn't like normal dope and it has a strange texture and they didn't care. They snorted some and said they felt good too and we hopped clubs a few times and ended up going back at 7am. 


Anyways, sorry for the long rant, this was just the first time i picked up in a foreign county. Later on, i met a different dealer with 100 times better shit like AMAZING shit, and other things that happened to me, spent 2 weeks at a detox hospital (I was only foreigner in there), and it was mad strange there!, also saw a regular doctor who prescribed medicine for withdrawals, getting hooked onto sleeping medicine and not remembering a lot of stuff (Zopiclone/Ambien drugs), got into a street fight while waiting for my dealer, and had to do some grimy shit to get some money there, which i can tell these stories/or answer questions if anyone is interested.. only because this was mad long and kind of shitpost/rant, so i don't know if anyone actually read this. If you did, thank you!


Thank you for reading if you got through all of it.

He has never been to any drugs before besides marijuana and never taken opiates. He has definitely battled bad depression and also alcoholism (he was prob a ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù alcoholic) this year. 

According to him he has only been on fentanyl for 3 months and was only shooting up at work (he works 3 days a week) and the most he did was 500 micrograms in one shift. I did catch him with a fentanyl in his pocket about a month ago which he said he returned to hospital (he now admits he actually used it) and also he admitted to injecting over Xmas when he was off work (so these kinda go against him saying he only used at work). Also besides fentanyl he said he just took 1 morphine XR one time and no pills besides that.  Like i said some of this doesn‚Äôt add up but he really has no reason to lie about it now. 

My question is do you think it is possible for this one 30 day stay in rehab to be enough to help him get sober? I have heard so many horror stories about multiple stays At rehabs not working. However, 3 months doesn‚Äôt seem that long, will that help? He definitely wants to get sober. ",1518084264.0

is there any hope that i can stop here, and prevent withdraws from starting over? i used such a minuscule amount of dope compared to my regular dose, that im hoping i continue foward without having lost all my progress. 

i cant remember the last time i felt this devastated in my life. i carved out a rare window of time from my job/ other obligations to get this behind me and i still manged to fuck it up. 

and an honest word of warning: as helpful as benzos can be, i can assure you that my resolve in the withdrawal process was as strong as its ever been, but it call came crumbling down after one two many xanax.

Why Legalization of all Narcotics Benefits Everyone!,"I was inspired to write this essay upon a realization I received after reading this reply:

""..i wish dope was legal and fent wasn't an issue. In fact all drugs i wish were legalized and the money go to schools, rehabs, and anything else that can benefit society. Imagine if we took the taxes of drugs plus all the money spent to police them and spent it on making society a better place for all.""
~Ddddooope 
 
When Dddddooope made the connection between fentyal contamination as a product of criminalization, this realization dawned on me: 

All negative aspects (beyond the control of the user) is a result of The Criminalization of Narcotics period 


I believe future generations will reflect on the results of the prohibition of narcotics as a Holocaust. Not only as a transgression against the user & the addict, & their families but for everyone. 

The good news is we are on the tail end of prohibition. I believe in our lifetime drugs will be at least decriminalized (hopefully legalized).

People forget that The prohibition of alcohol required a constitutional amendment. Therefore the US Harrison Narcotics Act 1919 is 100% unconstitutional & total bullshit. 

If anything was learned from Alcohol prohibition, it was that prohibition doesn't work. Morality and Human Behavior cannot be legislatively fixed, and that when you prohibit something in strong demand it has the effect of concentrating power & money in the most ruthless suppliers. Which is the real reason behind drug prohibition. This created access to an unregulated source of bottomless fundraising for criminal elements of the power structure (e.g. CIA Iran contra etc.).

It's estimated that Heroin is a 2 to 4 trillion dollar a year market (tax free &w/out regulations) that's a lot of zeros:

$2,000,000,000,000 

Over 95% of world opium is produced in Afghanistan (post US invasion of course!) and 75% of that Afghan opium is converted into heroin in Pakistani labs. 

Please Don't get it twisted these Afghan Farmers are still poor AF and basically paid nothing. 

The real money is made somewhere downstream from the manufacturers and they have probably been cashing in for centuries (e.g. Skull&Bones Fraternity at Yale was created with Opium Money) 

On the Bright-side some European countries like Portugal have Decriminalized narcotic possession. Instead of arrest for those who are found in possession of illicit drugs, they are sent to a panel of health professionals that offer education and rehabilitation. 

The results of Portugals decriminalization proved unequivocally that drug decriminalization is beneficial to individual user &  the public health of Portugal. HIV/AIDS/Hep C across the board showed double digit % decreases. Although recreational drug use increased by 2-5% the overall rate of addiction dramatically decreased. Naturally Several other countries have followed Portugal example and universally showed positive results on both individually and societally.

Even some in the US have seen the light like Maryland in 2016 introduced a drug decriminalization bill(decriminalizing small,personal amounts), but it was voted down in the state house and not enacted into law but progress is progress

The legalization of recreational use of Marijuana has inspired hope in junkies like me that legalization of all recreational drugs is a possibility 

Full Legalization of Drugs should not seem radical, considering for millennia before 1919 essentially all drugs were legal and Human civilization progressed just fine(thrived even) with drugs legal. In fact in Ancient Rome it was considered a spiritual and narcotic use was encouraged during the end of year festival Saturnalia (the origin of a lot of Christmas traditions)

Truthfully it is an extremely  draconian to criminalize drug use. Attempting to legislate human morality or free will has be proven impossible every time it has been attempted.  

Furthermore the US Drug War has historically been more expensive then all other US Wars COMBINED! The ""War on Drugs"" Racks up federally $15 billion/year ($500 a second) since the Nixon Administration in the 1970s plus another $25 billion/yr from State and local governments. 

48 years x [($15b+25b)] = 
$1,927,000,000,000 

How many people could be sent to life saving rehabilitation with that money? How many people could that feed? How much Dope would that buy? 

 The result of trillions of tax pay dollars thrown at the drug war, and the people who are on the drugs have been ""winning"" because illegal drugs have never been more accessible than they are now. 

The demand for drugs will never, ever, ever(X infinity) go away regardless of legality, health risk, or price etc. therefore suppliers will always be willing to supply Drugs regardless of risk, legality, logistical difficulties, low logistical productivity etc.(to infinity). We know this to be true because of the continuous ingenuity of drug traffickers e.g. Narco Submarines, Narco Tunnels, etc. 

lt is important to note the negative ripple effect Drug Criminalization has on a macro & micro level, individual level & family and a governmental/societal/political level. 

The extent of the negative impact cannot be understated. 


 Drug Criminalization has had a disastrous effect on Narco Producing Countries in Central and South American: 
A historical example in Escobar's Columbia out of control hit men gunning down people in the streets, political bombings, lead to Chaos that spilled over into as automatic gunfire in Miami Malls. This continues today in Mexico  which has had Vietnam War level causalities/deaths because of out of control Narco Cartels who supply an out of control US demand for illegal drugs. 

When the Taliban Took power in Afghanistan after the 1980s USSR occupation. Opium production was nearly eliminated, but post US invasion opium production (protected and encouraged by the US Military & government) increased astronomically The result of this is a world-wide opiate pandemic. 
Historically invasion and control of Afghan Opium production seems to be a reoccurring ""Hail Mary"" pass for failing empires e.g. USSR 1980s British circa 1900. 

War and control of Narco Supply fit like hand and glove:

The British fought more than one hundred year long Opium Wars with China. Golden Triangle Heroin production during the Vietnam War. That became ""blue magic"" heroin in NYC. Amphetamine production by North Koreans and terrorist organizations like ISIS helps fund the most radical regimes. 

Again The negative impacts manifest everywhere on all levels of society. nowhere is unaffected from the negative impact of drug criminalization. 

As a global family we can not prevent addiction or outlaw it away. What we can do is control the way we as a society REACT  to the inevitability of addiction. 

It is a common misperception to place sole blame of these horrors on addiction itself; when it's our lazy and ignorant  ""throw them in jail"" mindset while trillions are made by ruthless suppliers and trillions spent on arresting low level users and sellers Is the cause of all these negatives . 

All of these negativities can be prevented by recognizing the problem, and taking action towards a solution.

The head of the hydra is our lack of oversight and regulation of the Narco Trade. 

It is harder for a teen to get Alcohol and Cigarettes than illegal drugs. 

This is because Alcohol /Tobacco:
#1.use is recognized as an inevitability and by nature ""unprohibitable"" (prohibition lesson learned)

#2 strict oversight/heavily regulated on all levels (its use,distribution, production , marketing, purity, qualities etc) 

#3 the public is educated about the risks (everyone knows cigs cause cancer & suppliers are required to disclose these risk clearly)

#4strict boundaries define extent of use,consumption, and interactions with society while under influence of effects. (Everyone knows not to drink and drive and everyone knows the consequences of crossing these boundaries, Also suppliers of Alcohol and Tobacco know the age requirements and the consequence of selling to under age) 

Additionally Alcohol and Tobacco generates tax revenue on a local, state, and federal level. 


Narcotics supply, consumption, production, and sale could be successfully regulated, oversaw, with clear set boundaries.

Quality and Purity would increase while price decreased. The BS of a sellers market would go away and accountability would reign! 

Almost overnight the negative ripple effects discussed above would decrease dramatically while public health would increase. 

I am sure there are a lot smarter people than me out there who don't spend most of there time fantasizing about opiates like I do 

I challenge anyone to refute this logic. I don't understand why we let this happen. I know there is a group of over 100k law enforcement officials who are for the legalization they have a group somewhere.

What was your first opiate? And if your opiate of choice is H, what made you switch over?

I guess I will go first...

I started off in my senior year of high school, got my wisdom teeth out and they prescribed me some hydros. Well I didn't even take them till a couple weeks later, took two before school and I was amazed on how amazing I felt, I was so talkative and I was actually paying attention for once. Well that fun only lasted a couple days. Then a month or so goes by and I went to snag one of my dads cigarettes and I noticed a couple pill bottles... so of course I check it out... little did I know my dad who I am really close with was getting loads of hydros and OxyContins (before the tamper seal). So I snagged some every so often when I knew he had extra from previous months.

 At some point he noticed but my dad didn't care and started giving me some. Then his medical condition was getting worse so he would spend time in rehab (physical rehab not drug rehab). Well he would do rehab for a couple weeks at the most and when he was released they would give him all the left over medications to take home! Meanwhile he was still getting his monthly supply from his doctor. So we had plenty of pills. Sadly my dad is now full time at a nursing home, but I love my dad and visit him everyday. Plus I have met some really good connects at the nursing home!

Also sorry my writing is garbage, I'm trying to quit dope so I'm using just enough to keep me from getting super sick but I still feel shitty. 

So I hear nothing about Oleg or the money he owes for a few weeks until one day I get a call from his brother, Pavel. Pavel says they (the mafia guys) are at their family home and about to steal it. Now Pavel's english isn't so great, so I'm a bit confused as to how a house gets stolen but he insists on me coming there to help them. Ok, whatever. I drive the 45ish minutes there. Now this is the villiage. We're talking pigs in the street, no indoor plumbing kinda villiage. So I pull up and immediately see 2 older model BMW's . Trademark low level mafia guys cars. I walk around back and there is Pavel and his mom, Iveta, just absolutely beside herself. Losing her shit. Standing around them are the most stereotypical slavic guys I've ever seen. I'm talking Adidas track suit, leather hat, fake gold chain, all while each is holding a bottle of vodka and sipping on it like its a fucking bottle of bud light or something. One of those guys is Taras, a guy who is obviously his boss and some other guy in a suit. Taras looks at me like we're old buddies and says ""eyyyy Cowboy! how you been man!?"" I was like ""uhhh, good until I got a call to come here"". 

So Pavel explains the situation to me. Since Oleg can't pay, and they can't find him, Taras and his ""people"" are going to take the family house instead. The guy in the suit was some bank or city official who the mafia had paid off to help them do these types of things. The house isn't great but I think it's gotta be worth more than $10,000. I tell Taras, ""There has to be something we can do? you can't take their house because of something Oleg did. His family has nothing to do with it"" So Taras takes me aside and starts asking me questions about my time as a soldier. He tells me that ""the men in Kyiv"" are supplying the volunteer battalions with men and equipment. If I agree to spend a year over in Eastern Ukraine, helping to train the guys and show them how to use the equipment, they'll leave my family alone, make me a ""Captain"" and I'll also be paid for my time. Well if you know anything about the war over there, that's a big ol' ""fuck that"" from me. I did my time and barely made it out. No fucking way. So Taras says fine we take the house and your family can sleep in the street. 

At the end of the day, I agreed to pay off Oleg's debt (I have quite a bit of money saved up) and in return, Iveta signed the house over to me. Literally the day after that all happens, Oleg gets home from wherever the fuck he was and acts like everything is great. This was about 3 years ago, and I have since been paid back as well. But not by Iveta, but by Ivetas sister. Why her sister you ask? Well, dumb fuck Oleg borrowed more money and got in with the wrong people, AGAIN. But thats a story for another time. 

I'll try to answer any comments or questions you have in the comments and thanks for reading/being positive about it even though I'm a shitty writer. Also, this really has nothing to do with me or anyone being a junkie, I guess I just happen to be a junkie while all this is happening lol.

Lately I have noticed significant afterglow and often significant times after my last dose. Today I dosed im the morning, I don't exactly feel high or euphoric but im awake and content. What Zvlyn
mean is normally I start to get sleepy by 8pm. Its past 2 and I could stay up for many more hours, feeling pretty damn good.

Whats the pharmacology behind me feeling so good so long after? It's as if when I dose I flip a switch, even after the high fades the switch is flipped the rest of the day. Like I'm wired but not wire-y with energy like stims, certainly not euphoric as the first 30-90 mins after dosing dope.

So, I live in the dense urban core of large PNW city--it's one of the three highest crime neighborhoods in the city, although of course it doesn't hold a candle to anywhere like Detroit or Chicago. 

My apartment is in kind of an odd setup--there's a normal small 8 unit apartment building at the streetfront and I live on the first floor of a two family house that is built onto the back of that building (or, maybe our house came first? who knows!). The upstairs apartment has access to the larger building, but we don't--we need to go down a walkway next to the front building and then into the backyard to get to our door. 

Our walkway borders the side and back of a large apartment building and its back driveway, which is at the corner of my street and one of our cross streets, and on the edge of our backyard, there's a largeish shed with a tangle of trees and shrubs around it. There's always been a problem with people cutting through our walkway and backyard, as well as the neighboring building's back driveway, to get to the other street, and, in the summer in particular,  hanging out around the shed and the driveway/outdoor stairwells of the large building next door to drink, smoke, camp out even, and, of course, shoot up.

I've never called the cops on anyone, although I will yell at people to leave when they wake me up (my bedroom window is right on the walkway, with five giant recycling bins under it; people sometimes go through them) but my building manager, whose apartment is above mine in the weird tacked on house, gets really het up about this stuff. Today, he saw two guys shooting up behind the shed and called the police.

Unknowingly, on my way home from work, I had arranged for the d boy to swing by, who is super prompt for the first time ever, of-fucking-course. He pulls up as the po-po are fucking arresting one of the poor schmucks from behind the shed (the other guy got away, I guess). We swing around the block  to make the handoff, instead of our usual me jumping in and out of the car, and he brings me back. As I'm strolling back down the walkway to my apt, trying really hard to look like I was just checking the mail, one of the nice officers flags me down. 

He is super concerned for my safety! He'd like to know about what kind of illegal activities have been happening around here and when. He assures me that the bike patrol (which he's part of) will start swinging by regularly, day and night, to make sure those junkies get the message. He is *so goddamn nice* to me.

And the whole time, I have three grams of fire tar in my pocket, which I'm tightly clutching because I'm terrified it will somehow leap out onto the ground. The nice officer wishes me a good day, repeats his assurances of higher police presence *in my fucking backyard* and I head inside. Whereupon, I proceed to get stupid high.

I have never felt my nice middle-class, middle-aged, white lady privilege so strongly before. Fuuuuuuuuuck.

I've never done H. But does anyone else feel like the best version of themselves when they've taken their meds? No one knows about my addiction, and I mean no one aside from this post. Do you know how many times I've heard ""You have changed so much for the better!"" from friends who knew me years ago? 

It's literally motivation in a pill for me. I handle my work and errands and all of life's minor inconveniences so much better since I've discovered these pills, two years ago after going into cardiac arrest. 

I am a clean cut, well spoken 26 year old paralegal. My boss has offered to match me the cost of law school and a position in the form as soon as I pass my bar exam. I never would have pursued or excelled at something like this, I feel, if I wasn't regularly taking my dose. I will never forget the first time I'd had them, 10mg of oxycodone in the emergency room about a week before my cardiac episode. I honestly don't know if I wouldn't take them going back now. 

I know I'm an addict and I know it can't go on. But I'm just wondering if anyone else feels like they can take on the world on pharmaceuticals. I feel like I am a textbook, highly functioning addict... I just know the down side is inevitable and an eventuality. :( ",1518048784.0

Needed to get this off my chest.,"A couple weeks ago I was rummaging through the medicine cabinet and found a nearly-full bottle of oxycodone pills from when I broke my leg four years ago. I still remember the rush I felt on seeing it--after reading through trip reports on Erowid, I was convinced that I had discovered the perfect drug. I took some, felt nice and relaxed, but craved something stronger. I was thinking about drastically increasing my dose for next time, but decided to do some research first. At this point the possibility of addiction had never once crossed my mind.

Of course, after reading the experiences of addicts, I quickly learned how insidiously addictive opiates are. The worst part is that I know exactly what it‚Äôs like to feel like your rational self has no control over your impulses--on a smaller scale, obviously, but my weaknesses are internet (reddit especially) and food. So I can be pretty confident of an opiate habit in my future if I ever get used to this oxycodone. Sometimes I convince myself that my supply is limited, but clearly that‚Äôs not true if I want more strongly enough.

So far my fear has kept me from taking more, but my desire has kept me from throwing it away. I‚Äôve ended up in a state of obsessively ‚Äúsaving it for later.‚Äù I‚Äôll take out the bottle when I get home from school, stare at the pills, count them, sit next to the toilet and contemplate flushing them away, and in the end return them to languishing silently in my closet.  

Lately I‚Äôve spent most of my free time either living vicariously through r/opiates or compulsively doing research--

‚ÄúOxycodone first time‚Äù

‚ÄúHow to potentiate oxycodone‚Äù

‚ÄúSnorting oxycodone‚Äù

‚ÄúOxycodone street price‚Äù

‚ÄúHow to use the dark net‚Äù

‚ÄúHow to do opiates regularly and not get addicted‚Äù

‚ÄúIs chipping opiates sustainable‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are opiates so addictive‚Äù

and so on.

I could probably get rid of these pills and forget about them within a few months, but one reason I‚Äôve been hesitant is the concern that this obsession raises about my underlying mental state. Is my life really so pathetic that I can‚Äôt think of living it without a chemical crutch? I probably need some guidance on how to seek out long-term, non-artificial happiness.

But the temptation, oh, the temptation. Happiness in a bottle‚Ä¶ of course I would never want to be dependent on something like that, but it can‚Äôt hurt to just experience it, just once, or several times, and even then it‚Äôs not like I could never get more, I would just have to look in the right places‚Ä¶ and the struggle continues.

I‚Äôm a meth addict but recently been fucking with oxys and whatever other opiates I‚Äôve managed to come across. Tried tramadol tonight and loved it. 


Honestly, I don‚Äôt get why meth is such a problem when opiates are soooo much better! I do meth because it‚Äôs what I can get, but I‚Äôm in love with the feeling of oxy already. I‚Äôd choose an oxy high over meth any day. 


My usual dose of oxycodone (1-2 times weekly) is 30mg, crushed pills. 


The problem I‚Äôm faced with? There‚Äôs no supply! Everyone here is doing meth so I only manage to get oxys when somebody I‚Äôm hanging out with has them in their medicine stash. Sure, there‚Äôs always the onion patch.. but even then, domestic opiate pharms (Australia) are expensive as fuck! 


So that leaves me with two choices... Lack the beautiful feeling of an opiate high that my body and mind yearn for.. or do heroin. I‚Äôm already a meth addict... so there‚Äôs no ‚Äòheroin is bad ahh I‚Äôm scared‚Äô mental barrier sorta thing. The thought of fent scares me though.. 


How does heroin compare to oxy? I assumed it would be stronger mg to mg.. but from what I‚Äôve read, oxy is typically stronger. 


If I managed to get some good quality H from the onion fields, what dosage can I expect to get me where 30mg oxy gets me? Is it a similar high or totally different? Elaborate? 


I‚Äôd prefer to avoid the needle.. what other ROA will get me feelin‚Äô nice? Can I simply weigh x amount of h, cap it and swallow it? 


Please opiate masters, guide me to a heroin habit........ why am I like this?

Clean for 6 days that's what's up. I dunno what the fuck to do with myself y'all. Im taking steps trying to be good but it's all bullshit. 

The past 4 months I've used meth everyday and h when I could afford it. It came to a crashing halt  last saturday. my best friend, who somehow still cares about me, picked my ass up got me out of an abusive fucked up living situation with full intent on bringing me to rehab. 

Ya know when you live the life so long, so isolated, surrounded only by users..it's fuckin weird to have people who aren't in that life and still care. I was banging about a gram a day of clear, and still I'd sleep. I hated it but I'd still crash at stoplights, in the middle of work,.., my body was so fucked. Now ive lost my house, my dogs, I virtually have nothing but track marks and acouple dollars in my account.

Rehab wasn't an option that day. I'm  damn good at persuasian.. arnt all addicts? I convinced her to let me try to get clean and that's what I did. I detoxed off a gram of clear a day with decent h withdrawals. It's been 6 days and it feels like 6 months. My heart was so fucked up. For the first 4 days I had this constant painful electrical pulse that would surge through my body if my heart rate increased at all. I never googled it, it's gotta be a symptom of being on that shit so long without any natural neurotransmitters. 

Ivr finally started sleeping again..but I fight falling asleep like crazy. I got kicked out of my friends place cause I started hooking up with dudes I met on tinder. Lmao. god damnit bitch , just so desperate to feel something good. She let me back to her house yesterday because she didn't want the guilt with where I was going..

So. I did an intake today. But I'm still lying.. well I think I am. I dont know. I'm drug seeking like crazy but also putting myself in treatment ? I think I'm going to treatment cause I don't want to die but yet I feel so apathetic about it. I'm putting myself in treatment cause I don't want to be homeless? I'm putting myself in treatment cause I want to find connects? The struggle is fucking real. 6 days y'all. This is the longest I've been sober in 15 years. I'm tryin to give myself credit because of that but I'm trying to get fucked up more.

 I don't know who I am or what the fuck o should do. Ive been lying so long it's apart of my personality. Multiple personalities. I acted like I was being honest earlier today at treamtent and I'm convinced I really thought I was. This is being honest, right here right now. I miss you fuckers. I got some boy on the way.

7wf8et,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7wf8et/generic_pills/,5,https://redd.it/7wf8et,TrappeddownSouth,Generic Pills,"Here's my question. I have heard a number of people say and I have read on numerous forums that generic drugs in the US can be +/- 10% of the amount of the actual drug that is in the brand version. IE an old generic 80mg Oxycontin could have between 72 and 88mg of oxycodone.

From what I understand though, generic drugs in the US have to be the exact same in terms of dosage strength as their branded counterpart. The FDA website states that all generic drugs are the ""same strength"" as their branded counterpart.

The difference in strengths just doesn't make sense either. Some drugs, like chemo drugs, are dosed down to the mcg and doctors are super specific about what they give - an error of 10% could seriously harm their patient.

People who talk about the plus or minus 10% are always saying that that is why some generic drugs do not work as well. Again though, from what I understand, it mainly has to do with the binders and fillers. A brand drug will definitely have different binders and fillers than the generic and that can easily affect the rate of absorption, bioavailability, etc and that can easily affect how a person perceives the strength of a drug.

I am trying to find out one way or another because this has bugged me for a long time. Does anyone have a link or something to anything official that shows the plus or minus 10%? Or any direct proof that that this is not true. The only thing I can find is that generic FDA statement.",1518198935.0

I have been clean for about two years with the help of suboxone.   I have not been getting the subs through an MD but rather from the same person I‚Äôve always gone through.   However, I‚Äôm now pregnant and so I have stopped taking the suboxone and really need to get on subutex.    The problem is that nobody has it which means I‚Äôll need to go to a dr to get it.

I know, I know, there are tons of provided websites and so forth but I‚Äôm on state insurance (your all shocked I‚Äôm sure lol) and the only places that take that insurance are treatment centers.     I am not against treatment but everyone I‚Äôve talked to will require me to go through OPT as if I was just getting clean.    Frankly, I don‚Äôt have time in my life for that right now and tbh don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs necessary.    But if I go anywhere else they want like $300-400 for an office visit!

It‚Äôs not just my body that I have to thing about- ya dig?   
So I desperately need to know if there is a way for me to find a Dr that takes state insurance that provides Rx that is not a treatment center.   (The one on the east side shut her doors recently)

Also, fuck the cartels, their pretty penny would be in the hands of the ""usual"" economy)


I'm just watching a documentary about the drugs in Syria and Saoudi arabia and basically ALL parts of the world are fucked because of dangerous illegal drugs.
I know i'm almost dreaming but think about it : A worldwide association compiling all the documentaries about how drugs fuck up entire populations and cost the governments money, with data and shit, because i think that the solution to pretty much all economic problems could be solved by the legalisation of all drugs(in a controlled setting, i'm not advocating that whoever wants to would be able to buy them at the supermarket).


In the US you already have the LEAD program(at least in Seattle) which is close to legalisation(it's just decriminalisation, but in fact economically it's ALREADY CHEAPER than strict prohibition). Since the world is governed by money hungry people i think we are not too far from the obvious : legalisation = healthier addicts = more money for the govt. Legalisation = benefits of drug trafficking close to zero, because it would enter the legal economy= more money for the govts. You get my drift)


I know it's kind of a shitpost, but still : why wouldn't we try to set up an organisation which would state the already obvious, but in the name of the wealthy motherfuckers who rule this fucking planet, which serious stats on how much each government would benefit from a waaaay less strict prohibition would benefit from it, all of this by country and stuff. I know it's a lot of work, but we have people from all parts of the world here, we encounter boredom quite often, why wouldn't we set up an organisation(non profit of course) which would show in every fucking country the benefits of drug legalisation in a controlled setting by getting the stats for our own country/state, the solutions it would be able to provide, and moreover the shitloads of tons of money it would produce and benefit EVERY citizen of every country.

Advice needed!,"Hey there, occasional lurker here, this is a throwaway acc. and I'd like your thoughts on my situation. I feel like I'm reaching something of a crossroads with my habit. I've been using for over 2 years full time, it would usually equal about 150mg of oxy a week. I get it through doctors and also DNMs (I live in an area its difficult to get). Also there was one occasion where I bought 3g of h that I snorted over about 2 weeks (that was a damn good fortnight haha).


Its a relatively low level habit at this stage but still, going without the pills sucks. Recently I just feel like I'm going through it so much quicker then I used to. Meaning I usually run out early and spend several days replacing it with whatever else I can find.  
It's getting to the stage where I might as well try and take an extended tolly break or give up and try to buy more heroin.
Before you all say its a good time to stop now completely, I've got relatively low level physical disability which causes me some pain and I'm going to need some more surgery soon, its unlikely I'm going to be able to get through this without opiates. And regardless I'm not sure I'd want to. Its helped me a lot through some difficult times the last few years. Ultimately it feels a bit futile to try and get clean for good. But I also realise that swapping over to heroin probably isn't going work out well for me. And at the same time its something I'd almost be excited for. I feel like I'm at my most productive when I'm high and when I'm not I'm just depressed and do fuck all. I'm a bit conflicted at the moment. 

There's probably only one person I feel like I could talk to this about, he's my psychiatrist. I feel like I can talk to him about pretty much anything, and we have briefly discussed my drug habits. But he writes me up for oxy and I don't want to give him any reason to stop at this stage. Any advice would be great.

Or sometimes, all it takes is one bad day to reduce the strongest willed man alive to lunacy, addiction. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day. You all had a bad day once, am I right? I know I am. I can tell. You all had bad days and everything changed. 


Why else would you put a dart after kicking heroin so many times it's uncountable?


Hah, I'm just being over dramatic there. But that's all it took...one bad fucked up day of finding out my dad got diagnosed with cancer finally broke my will.  I cold copped and started using every day for about a month. 

Nah I wasn't going down that road again, 4 oz of kratom, 200 xanaxs that were sent to me by mistake (I only ordered 50),   and 25 flu-alplrozalam,  I was gonna do it. 




First few days was hard getting the kratom down, go slow, so you don't vomit. Once you figure out how to toss and wash right, you can litterally remove all WD.  There lingered a slight runny nose, and slight an anxiety, but that was it. 

The first 3 days I'm shoveling kratom all day till it works, then stop, it surprisngly works for  a  long, long, time for me, like 10+ hours this way.  Eventually, you will get hungry, and tired and you will be able to (!) both sleep and eat. But I went through a whole oz in a day in a half. After day 4 I didn't have to dose near as hard.


This is Day 9, I havn't taken kratom, I haven't even taken xanax today. I feel....okay. Though rebound anxiety is sure to come later on. But like normal again, like it's all over.

To those struggling:


If I did it, so can you!

TLDR: Read above statement. 

BTW. Fuck using xanax for WD for opiates. If FLAP wasn't an RC and wasn't so hard to dose, I'd say use microdoses of that, crushed a .5mg pill and swallowed 1/4 of it, smooth anxiety relief all day just about. However it is way stronger then xanax and will knock you out if you took a whole .5 pill. Something new I learned, and to consider, for posterity.


IDK if I will go back to chipping ever.  I told myself I wouldn't if I fucked up. Time will tell.

Long time lurker/subscriber here (via my regular acct, but due to some of my friends (and former students) knowing that handle, I felt I should use a throwaway for this, I hope that's ok).  I have a quick question for everyone that I'm sure has been discussed before, but I have yet to find a thread here, or anywhere else (i.e. bluelight, etc) that seems to apply specifically to my situation.


I suffer from severe chronic pain.  As such, I've been taking oxycodone pretty regularly for the last 10 months or so (sporadically before that).  I've been able to manage this pretty well, generally I put up with my pain the best I can during the day and leave my doses until the evening - taking 7/5-15mg a nights.  Otherwise, I spend all night on the floor with my legs propped up sobbing.  I don't think I've ever gone over 30mgs a day.  Well, with the good ol' ""opiate epidemic"" gaining momentum, doctors are becoming increasingly less willing to give prescriptions - I lost mine and a friend of mine (who usually threw me her extras) lost hers as well.  Meanwhile, other connections for opiate pharmaceuticals are also few and far between.  So, I'm getting a little terrified here - not because of withdrawal or anything, rather over actual ability to function/sleep due to pain.  


So my question is this: how bad is the switch to heroin?  I'm not interested in injecting.  I'm not interested in chasing a rush.  I really, legitimately want to know how snorting or smoking heroin compares to orally taking oxy or snorting opana.  I'm not sure I would've considered it, but I have a friend who did oxy a fair amount and then tried snorting heroin and swore to me that it was pretty much the same.  Anyway, no matter how much oxy/opana I've had available to me, I have always been able to manage my doses...is that doable with heroin (again, only snorting or smoking, NO IV), or is heroin really this big, bad monster that is soooooo much more terrible and worse than oxy?  From everything I read, it seems like people are ALL over the board about it; some folks say they think oxy is better than heroin, others than heroin is better than oxy.  I know a lot of other threads that deal with switching from oxy to heroin would say that my daily oxy dose is pretty low and advise me NOT to make the switch because of that, but this isn't about money --- it's truly about availability, I'm simply unable to get oxy anymore.  Any advice would help.  I'm honestly desperate.

So anyway, today after a 4 and a half month break, I decided to pick up a couple of bags.  Long story short, I took up a couple of very small shots in a burger king to get a feel for it again, and lo and behold when I got home my syringe had clogged, and I broke it trying to fix it..

So I started snorting it, and it just feels like such a waste.  I have no more money, and there's a blizzard out anyway.  I don't even enjoy it that much, it burns the fuck out of my nose (it's probably cut to shit), makes me nauseous, no rush, the whole thing makes me angry.  It makes me wanna pick up again as soon as I can because I couldn't get that satisfying high that I wanted.  Even after a 4 month tolerance break snorting it does almost nothing for me.  Almost.

So my question to you guys is; Is there a more effective way to ingest heroin other than snorting or injecting?  Or could I possibly make a syringe?  I still have the broken needle.  Everything is intact, the 'pull back' part with the plunger is just broken in half.  Thanks.

  When we got to my friends house at around 2:30 I yakked the second we got out of the car. It was just Hawaiian Punch  (what I took the pill with) and a little bit of water since I hadn‚Äôt eaten.

Lovecraft.,"I first read this story at age 17, now I am almost 40... It has always remained in my mind as a story of drugs, depression, and death. It reminds me of my own journey with opiates and my self-destructive nature. I've used my nickname for a long time... I'm getting better, but I could have unlocked that door at any time....

It'll only take a moment...

Ex Oblivione by H.P. Lovecraft

When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim‚Äôs body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.

Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.

Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.

And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.

Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.

After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.

So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.

Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.

Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.

Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.

But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.",1518154917.0

Is there anything I can do to ensure the absorption is as good with the pills besides not talking and making sure I don't have a ton of spit buildup in my mouth?

Anyway, heroin seems to be cheaper and better in general so I want to try it and see how it is. I just have a few questions first:

* What is nodding off like? When I do the DHC my eyes will close on their own and I will drift in and out of consciousness but at any time I can wake myself up and have enough energy to go out or the likes. Is it like this for heroin?

* How much should I take first time? I don't want to risk anything so how much would a completely opiate naive person take first time to snort/smoke

* what type should I get? I've heard theres different types, what type should I get for snorting/smoking.

* whats the difference between snorting and smoking?

He shut me down immediately and said they cannot even talk about it. I asked if he could just inform me about any contraindications and he said no. Even totally off the record? No. How about a hypothetical issue where some imagined patient wanted to make sure weed wont fuck with the seven different psych meds I (oops, imagined patient) is taking? I SAID NO!

The reason I bring this up is I am on a pain contract with the VA and am on moderate dose opiates (120 5mg percs a month, 4 per day). I have a long and detailed history of heroin addiction (caused by over prescription of opiates by the VA) and it has taken me a LONG time to earn the trust of my doctors and get put back on opiates.

I am terrified of popping hot for TCH and being totally fucked and in a world of hurt.

It is so frustrating that the Feds have cracked down so hard on federal level providers and they cannot even mention stuff like weed.

So I‚Äôd gotten a 10 pack of 30s a few times from this girls bf who I worked with and had just gotten out of prison and everything has always gone straight.

Well this time dude wanted to meet at a Walgreens and I pull up and he tells me to come inside and then motions to a cig pack on the shelf in one of the aisles and says leave the money there. I‚Äôm like nah that‚Äôs too sketch just come out to my car so I can check them out and shit. He follows me to my car and I get in and he‚Äôs like standing between me and the door and hands me the cig pack and I‚Äôm just getting sketched out now and tell him hop in this is weird as fuck.

Well dude gets in and I‚Äôm looking at the pills and they are purple and shit and I‚Äôm like dude these are what I wanted and he‚Äôs all telling me they are new and shit. Well I just got a brand new iPhone and so I start searching the imprint and shit and they are fucking ambien. Im like dude I don‚Äôt want these and he‚Äôs all like come on bro I didn‚Äôt come up for nothing give me something for them and I‚Äôm just like dude these aren‚Äôt worth shit.

Now I should mention the money($300) is sitting in the door pocket on my side and I‚Äôve got my leg blocking the pocket Incase he tried anything.

Well dude pulls out a pistol and puts it to my head and yelling to give him the money, now I live in a red neck ass state and there‚Äôs no hood in the entire state so these dudes are just wanna be gangsters for the most part and I was dope sick as fuck and that was all my money. I told him he‚Äôs not gonna shoot me over $300 and to get the fuck out of my car, well he ends up pistol whipping me and splitting my head wide the fuck open like blood is everywhere and starts punching me. I‚Äôm laying on my horn yelling and shit and he reaches over me to the door pocket so I start teein off on his head bouncing it off the horn and people are stopping in the parking lot just watching. Dude finally gives up and says something like calling me a pussy white boy and how he‚Äôs gonna kill me and bails out of the car. I floor it out of the parking lot but not before clipping him with the car and hitting him on my way out. Get home and shower and the bleeding is just turning everything bright ass red. 

In the end I got 8 stitches, my orbital socket was fractured and the interior of my car was forever ruined and blood stained but I kept my money, he left the gun and pills and his phone lol. Ended up trading he gun for pills the next day so wasn‚Äôt a total loss lol.",1518275448.0

7wlmv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7wlmv1/harm_reduction_or_escalation/,5,https://redd.it/7wlmv1,Lickarockonfoil,Harm Reduction or Escalation,"A few days ago I ran into an old friend at the gas station. He was filling out a lotto ticket at the counter with his back to me. I walked up behind him and said, ‚Äúhey, you got those lotto folds?‚Äù

He smiled and we talked for a while. I could tell he was pissed about something but in line at the gas station wasn‚Äôt the place to hash it out. 

I spent the rest of the day trying to recall just what I did to fuck him over and the only thing I could come up with is that I showed his son how to use a needle. 

Truth be told, at the time I was under the impression that his son, my good friend at the time, had shot up before because he told me as much. He said he was having a hard time hitting and asked if I‚Äôd help. So I did. 

Soon after I moved to the otherside of the country and ten years slide by. I move back and find out my homie got popped writing bad scripts, reduced his time by ratting on his friends, and still did time on a handful of felonies. 

I‚Äôm almost certain that he told his folks I taught him to use a needle and in their minds all of the shit their kid did is my fault.

This wasn‚Äôt the first time shit like this happened either. Years ago a girl I ran with and dated did the same thing. Told me she shot up before and asked if I‚Äôd help her hit. Again, she came from a dope using family so I didn‚Äôt question her. Fast forward a few years and she‚Äôs downstate turning tricks and a few people want to fuck me up for introducing her to the needle....

The thing is, in both cases, I probably would have shown them both how to inject if they had been honest about it being their first time. I used to volunteer at a mobile syringe exchange, I‚Äôm a proponent of harm reduction and have seen and lived the consequences of unsterile injection practices. 

On the other hand I do feel a little guilt about the way things turned out for these two. Is it my fault? Fuck no. Ive been using a needle on and off since 98 and have managed to do it without sucking dick or hanging my ass out for garunteed felony time.

None the less r/opiates, I‚Äôm curious about your opinions and experiences. Has a desire to practice harm reduction ever painted you as the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù? Have you ever felt responsible on any level for leading a pal down a dark path?

Anyways, I thought about giving farm animals opiates during stressful period of the animal's life. Like during transport, slaughter and the stealing and ''rape'' of the animals. Tramadol seem to be the best opiate for this since it's long lasting. It's already used in africa because it makes the animals more docile.

Fast foward another 30 minutes he calls dude asking where he's at. We pick dude up and start riding again. I ask, ""what we doing bruh?"" He's like ""this aint dude, we still got to ride to his crib."" Now im sitting here like WTF the middle got a middle??? At this point my junkie senses tingling, im getting sketched the fuck out. Phone rings and he picks up. He aint got a G. (The ""PLUG"" aint got a fucking G??) I say ""well whats he got?"" ""2 buns"" this half ass motherfucker says. ""For real?"" I asked. ""Yea, say he waiting to re-up."" He paused for a second. ""It's still gon' be 200 doe."" ""Huh?, you said $150 for a G bruh!"" I'm getting heated, raising my voice and shit. ""Oh, Right, Right.."" he said. About that time my girl text asking if I was Ok. I text her back. ""Babe, I got a bad feeling i'm bout to get robbed."" Dude says we almost there.

I haven't been on in here in awhile.  I had everything stolen from me.


The Thomas Fire started Dec 4th & I got on greyhound the morning of Dec 2nd.  I went down south to visit some friends.  *A drive that should take 5hrs but took 10hrs)*  Usually, I used greyhound as my escape plan not to go on ""vacation"".  *Having no idea that less than 48 hours later the whole fucking city would lose power & shit would hit the fan.*

The power to our hotel went out the next night & was out for 15+ hrs.  *Long story short, my ""friends"" were tweaked out of their minds & ended up thinking I was lying about how big of a deal the fire was & they became convinced a 105lbs white girl was trying to kill them, lol.*  I got so fed up so when the cops finally came us to mandatory evacuate us I told them I needed to go to the hospital for my seizures.  That night I watched the fire jump the freeway, it was so fucking scary...


The next 3 weeks I spent homeless in *(a city I'd never been too & knew no one)* was a complete fuck fest.  On top of that I was stuck in the middle of the largest fire in California history which made it pretty scary.  I woke up at night & it looked like it was snowing but it was raining ashes.  That was the night the fire doubled in size & after that everyone started going around with face masks & it was the perfect time to rob people.

Except with the refugee influx, we have a bunch of North africans/Syrians peddling bunk dope. Absolutely wouldn't recommend picking up from them folk, get your dope from Russians or Iranians like any kraut junkie worth his salt.


Germany has a pretty interesting dope scene, you wouldn't expect us to, but it's vibrant. Open air markets are pretty rare, save for major cities (by German standards, so at least 500k people). To make up for that we have other Junkie meet-up spots, like using kit vending machines, Methadone/Heroin clinics, or fixing rooms. Just shoot the shit with the locals, offer to toss them a bag or two, walk to the spot with them, and of course, DON'T LET YOUR MONEY WALK (some things are universal it seems). Get a number and there's your connect. The dope is always brown pretty much, it comes in from the ports of Amsterdam and Northwest Germany, at least that's my theory since the quality of dope is proportional to your distance from the Netherlands. Your gear comes wrapped in multiple sheets of plastic, my connect usually kept it in a fanny pak, which I thought was hilarious seeing him seemingly reaching into his crotch to pull out my product. You call the guy, he tells you where he's at, you take a walk (public transit fam, it's decent over here), and hand that shit over when you made sure feds ain't watching.


So where do I fit into this? I'll keep it short since I don't wanna dwell on past fuck-ups too much. I'm currently in my mid-20s, med-school dropout, slow-as-mud recovering fiend and wageslave. 5K in the hole to boot, turns out you can't spend your academic scholarship on dope and coke when you end up dropping out two semesters in. Who'd a thought?! I don't fit into this scene at all, but it got me out of many sketchy situations where people who looked a bit more down on their luck to put it mildly got stopped and searched. Sat next to a cop on the train home with a gram and a half under my tongue, thank fuck it was wrapped up good.


One of my more recent memories is meeting up at a train station which I will not disclose since it was pretty close to where I live. Wait for the d-boy to show up, he takes us on a wild goose chase around the city. First he has to pick up a recipe at the pharmacy (benzos, what else), then he starts getting into a public shouting match with a customer we ran into who had wronged him in the past (way to keep this discreet!). Randomly he stops to smoke his shitty spice, telling me to position myself in a way to hide him doing the deed. After a while he tells us to wait in a local park, he's gotta go to the source, break up the dope and bag it up. I am hurting at this point, it's been 24 hours. I hand him my 80 bucks though, since he's been trustworthy in the past and commence to lay down on a park bench. So here we are, four fiends growing more and more nervous every minute, pacing up and down, peeking down the street he left for. One hour, two hours. I'm starting to put this down as a loss when he walks up like an angel bringing the gospel of soon-to-be shot dope. Next thing we  head down to the local fixing room and prompty get denied. It's full apparently, fuck that's what I get for copping during junkie rush hour. We ask if we can be admitted into the other rooms out back, but they're apparently reserved for people smoking crack and dope, we're not allowed to shoot up back there since they can't guarantee we'll be attended to in the way appropriate for someone injecting (no staff, no clean needles to hand out, yadda yadda).


We say fuck this, walk a few roads down to the next park and shoot up using our nasty ass rigs with the numbers off, as well as our dull as fuck needles. It did the job done more than well, I nod out immediately, my using ‚Äûbuddies‚Äú take off with my cotton and rig (lol), the cops mistake me for a drunk (it was Oktoberfest season), all is well.


So that was that. If anyone is interested, I'll see if I can think of another story. ",1518380031.0

I'm currently at my parents, away from my plug, trying to kick my mediumish habit and go back to chipping before it gets too bad.

I went from being mopey and not being able to get out of bed to being all talkative and feeling like I could run a 5k. It's really crazy how much of a hold opiates can get over you. 

Have you guys read The Odyssey? The Island of the Lotus eaters had to be based on poppy eaters or something. Maybe Homer had a bit of experience with opiates that inspired him to write that bit.

Are opiates the worst addiction? I have a female friend that's a bit of a coke head and the constant up and down of that seems like it's gotta be worse for your body. I imagine any stim is worse for your body than opiates. Anyways, I'm done ranting now.",1518377392.0

I woke up maybe 15 minutes ago to 3 missed calls from Bud and a fourth in progress. I was with him most of last night and we had plans to do some shit today, but not until later, he started calling at 7:30 this morning. I answer the fourth call and I'm still very confused. For context I left a trap house at like 2AM last night and he stayed the night there, so he was there during this phone call. 

""Hey bro, uh, what are you doing right now are you busy at all?"" 

""I mean I literally just now opened my eyes so I'm wakin up a bit. What's up is all well?"" 

""Yeah it is it's chill. One of Kevin's roommates needs to go to the hospital, not emergency room. And not the one here either in (that city I fucking hate with all my being). He has gas money to put you ahead on mileage."" 

""Okay yeah I probably can. Is he okay? Is it like an urgent type of thing, what's wrong with him?""

""Honestly I'm not really sure. Um. I'll go find that out though."" I hear him move into the next room and mumble a sentence or two before saying to whoever, ""Oh okay yeah."" Back on phone with me. 

""He's dying.""

My ears are ringing and I'm struggling to hold my eyes open. ""... What""

""Yeah you know when you like, cant really breathe good at all, your chest feels tight and hurts and your vision gets all trippy like your about to die? He's got that."" 

""Is he really dying?"" 

""Honestly I'm not sure I'll go find out."" This motherfucker. Comes back after like less than 10 seconds. ""Uh yeah probably, but it isn't like 'AAAHHH we need to get in the car right now!' Sorta thing like it's chill."" 

""What? Bud if he's legitimately dying that's an emergency, call 911, not me. Or at least take him the ER not the hospital.""

""Bro that's exactly what people been telling me that one day my ear fell off at the YMCA pool. Saw it on the ground and was like 'huh that looks like my ear' so I brought it to the lifeguard and he was the first of a few people to tell me 'Are you fucking retarded bring that the emergency why do you wanna go to a hospital?'""

""Right yeah and I'm telling you the same thing right now. Wait why the fuck did your ear fall o-""

""But you know what they say, when you know, you know when to go see a doctor. Like this other time-"" shit well oops I guess he was still talking, ""I woke up and it was like a tennis ball under my shirt bro. But not my shirt, it was under my skin that was under my shirt-"" 

""Look dude I have shit to do and if this guy is dying-""

""And it was almost rock hard, and so I knew I needed to go to the doctor-""

""Okay that's great but again with the ER/Hospital thing I'm trying to get you to understand-""

He wasn't done. ""Doctor was useless. He just gave me the number of a different doctor.""

""K."" I give up.

""Its like bro you didn't go to school for a communications degree, you went for medical degree.""

""Uh huh. Right.""

""You should already be able to tell me what's up with me, not just send me to the dude who's smarter.""

""Yeah no, totally.""

""I mean it's like America got it's priorities all kinds of fucked up.""

Silence. I put the phone on mute for a few seconds to laugh my ass off and mutter what the fuck to myself, and hop back on.""

""Look I have a couple things I have to deal with this morning, I'll make a couple calls and call you back with a timeline. If dude is actually genuinely dying call 911, paramedics have probably been to that house a thousand times.""

""Yeah bro it's chill take your time.""

So yeah that's what I'm working with. He's so sweet though I can't even be a little bit irritated. Definitely going to remember that phone call for the rest of my life. Now to the whole cello fiasco. 

Some stupid bullshit went down with Bud and his roommate, and he's getting thrown out. I was there and convinced him to let him stay until he could work up the money to get out of state because he wants to go be with his son a few states away (I know right?). This cello is the only thing he has to sell really, and it should get him just the right amount to take the Hound out of here and have a little extra money in case anything goes wrong. I convinced his roommate to let him stay til it was sold 3 days ago, he's about to not have it that way anymore. He won't let Bud stay for more than enough time to sleep at night, and won't let him eat any of the food, so I wouldn't be suprised if he got thrown out by tonight or tomorrow. His other options are trap houses and shelters, with the cello being his only hope he can't mob that around without almost guanteeing it'll get broken or snagged. 

Though it seems the customer base for fine string instruments is pretty select, this cello has to get sold so he can not be thrown to the streets, but instead make it to his son. Fuck I love this guy.",1518369820.0

Sepsis set in. White blood cells dropped. Drs  couldnt say if I'd live. 

They said I'd be on the breathing machine for at least 5 days. I woke up after 3 full recovery.

When you become a heroin addict, your world becomes very small. 

You go from being a party kid with a lot of casual party friends...

... to a drug user with some drug friends...

...to a drug addict who hangs out with other drug addicts...

...to a fucking loser who only associates with dealers, resents the ones who try to keep you around and chatting when the only thing on your mind is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fucking go home so I can put this shit up my nose/lungs/veins‚Äù. 

Being alone in your room with your baggy of drugs, clutching it like fucking Smeagol with his Precious Ring, finally feeling calm as you block the entire world out and let the drug take control for a couple of hours. It‚Äôs honestly really pathetic.

this story has just arrived. My friend took a shot of very good heroin, he was already stone and did not have a great tolerance, but he made a shot like me (I have 10 years of dependence behind me) luckily I had made a little one I think he wanted to do like me. It's been a week since I told him to take less but he does not listen to me
The material is much better than what he usually took, I warned him several times but he does not really understand.
So he took two shots at maybe 30 min interval (maximum), the first was ok for his tolerance, but the second was too big, I think.
I see him immediately nodding with the syringe in his hand (removed from the arm) so I took it and put it in a trash and I realized that it was too much for him (before that I had not seen how much he put in his shot he told me later). 1-2 min later, he goes to my couch, goes to bed, I watch him and suddenly he makes a strange noise as if he wants to inspire but can not then I shook him and slapped him, at first, he does not react eventually he woke up relatively quickly 15-30sec I think maybe more difficult to say in this condition. After that, he kept nodding and I looked at him insistently, asking him to breathe deeply and to occupy him to prevent him from nodding again. After taking a small line of coke (on my advice) to wake him up. But he was still stone,
T + 1h30 He wants to go home, I have withheld 1 hour but finally he goes away. In my opinion it's ok but I'm still worried, so I told him to put his phone on the max volume and I told him I'll call you in 15-30-60min and if he does not answer I'll come with naloxone.
Do you think there is still a risk for him to stop breathing? I think it was just the peak of the shot that suddenly stops his breath but after 2 hours I think it's ok ..
if you have constructive advice and opinions, ",1518329914.0

I'm on a LONG sub taper. At this point 1/2 milligram every morning when I wake up between 7 and 9. Most of the time, I'm fine. But once or twice a month, I get a vicious headache. This used to happen when I was using other opiates too. With heroin I just assumed it was a cut or I took too much, and with pills I assumed it was dosage related, but with the subs, I cut my strips into 16 equal pieces with an exacto, so it shouldn't be happening. I've thought of everything, what and when I eat, cigarette and coffee consumption before during and after dosing. Nothing seems to clearly be the problem.






I've heard that the bupe could be unevenly laid across the strips, so if I had access to 2mg strips maybe that would help, but if they were so uneven as to give me headaches like I've taken too much, it seems like sometimes I'd get them unevenly doses in the opposite direction and they wouldn't totally stave off withdrawal.

I overdosed on a mixture of furanylfentanyl, alprazolam and heroin last Christmas. I have no idea how I am still alive to be honest, because I used alone and luckily I woke up.

When I woke up, I noticed my fingers and lips were blue. I had puked in my bed, I could barely take two steps because my coordination was extremly bad, my chest hurt very bad, my eyes kept drifting to one side, I heard a beeping in my ears and couldn't concentrate on anything. The severe symptoms lasted a few hours and the other things went away over the course of the week.

However, I still notice that I overdosed one year later. My long- and short-term memory is fucked, I can't concentrate on much, I feel ""stupid"", like I lost some IQ points. Also, I am uncomfortable very often, it is hard to explain. My movement feels a bit ""laggy"", it isn't smooth anymore, I am often short of breath and I have restless legs now.

My question is if anyone here has experienced something similar. I have never talked to a doctor or anyone in real life about this, I am too ashamed. My mum would probably cry so much. She was downstairs when I overdosed, sitting alone next to the Christmas tree, sad that I wasn't coming down, because I would rather nod... I am ashamed of myself, to be honest, but that's not the topic.

Would be nice to hear similar stories. I am honestly just glad I am alive. At the same time I feel like I should have died right there and then, though. I don't know. I feel dead sometimes and it's really weird.

I owed Cliff a battery for the Mac Book I sold him. He told me to pay for soda a couple of times this week and that he'd order the battery on his pay day. Btw I made off like a bandit, do those in the know... it has a Corey2Duo.


Last week he wanted to hang at my house for a little because a girl was gonna come knocking to get pills bc ""she was desperate"".


Turns out according to my sub connect that he took this other girls $300 for blues, spent it for himself and told her that he needed it bc he was sick but he'd pay her back.

&nbsp;

Here's some exerts from his message. Long story short, I told him I'd buy him soda tonight as I promised.

Cliffnotes/from text messages:

""Instead of the commercial  COKE AND A SMILE, its  PEPSI AND A BUMP OR 2""

""I dont always bother u w/bad news.  I want ya to hang a bit after and rip a bump or 2 maybe. Thats all.""


After he asked me if I'm still working til 10pm and after I said that I'd drop off his soda on my way home I also said:

""And I gotta get started an emergency turtle rank repaid when I get home for squirt.""

To which cliff responded:


""You know i dont mind coming over to ur crib and helping you wit the turtle repairs.  I just want to get out of the house, is that ok sir ?""

""Like obv u stop in to drop off the soda after work and id love to come chill after that.  That would be very cool.""

Thanks to the Intel from my sub connect, I think I know the reality. He's dodging the girl he owes $300 to.",1518304871.0

I‚Äôm more familiar/trust you guys.
I deleted my long dramatic posts..because they‚Äôre long and dramatic.

TLDR of the other post: boyfriend got sent to rehab, he has all the connects and I don‚Äôt have my car. I manage to get one of our dboys by commenting my number on his Venmo..


I Was supposed to get my car back Friday. They say maybe it‚Äôll be ready Tuesday. My boyfriend gets out Wednesday. I do not want to make him relapse. I hope I can even see him. His dad called me this morning, telling me not to go near him. That I‚Äôm no longer welcome in the house. That I‚Äôll get over it, I‚Äôm 18, and should go do some homework.

They don‚Äôt know I use. Like I‚Äôm clean to them. Maybe they think I‚Äôm the reason he relapsed. I wasn‚Äôt. He was using When I met him. If anything he‚Äôs the main reason I got addicted..
guess I‚Äôll just have to wait until he gets out and see how things go. Thinking about sending them a fucking edible arrangement. 

I‚Äôm sick. I had three bags, they got wet. Desperately left it out to dry, scraped it. Soaked the bags in water and boofed it. Water turned brown so I got something out of it... even shoved the fucking wet bag up my ass. Fucking pathetic.

I got this kid to drive me to (nj city were dope is sold) yesterday. Only he crashed his car on the way to my fucking house.

Today I got this girl who doesn‚Äôt use to drive me. Straight up told her what was gonna happen.

I call my dboy, straight to voicemail. Five calls and thirty minutes later he picks up. 300 dollars (100 from the original kid who was going to drive) for 70 bags. Fair. Whatever. I‚Äôve never copped alone though. I‚Äôm scared honestly. I have the worst luck. It‚Äôs like the universe is preventing me from getting this dope. Or being happy.

I‚Äôve never been this suicidal before. I know that‚Äôs bad to say. Especially since I‚Äôve had multiple suicide attempts. So it‚Äôs going to be hard not to purposely use 7/8/9/10 bags just to... make this stop. Maybe I‚Äôm naive and young. But I‚Äôm hurting so badly. I‚Äôve reached out to everyone I could think of... I begged my mom to bring me to my psychiatrist, they didn‚Äôt answer, I begged her to bring me to the hospital...written off as dramatic. A bunch of my gabapentin got wet along with my bags (a water bottle spilled in my purse). So I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôll work but I must have taken about 15-20 if not more. (100mg each). It won‚Äôt kill me but I wish it fucking would.

I understand I am dramatic. I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôm alone and without my boyfriend. I‚Äôm always with him. I‚Äôm terribly attached to him and miss him dearly. I‚Äôve never been in love the way I am with him. And now everything is against us. I‚Äôd like to think he‚Äôd pick me over his family. He‚Äôs very mad at them. But in reality... they will kick him out. He has no choice. 

I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. I‚Äôve been suffering for six years from mental illness. I get no relief. Ever. No medication, no therapy, no iop... I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm biologically fit to be alive.

Anyway I guess the main question... I took .5mg of xanax today in attempt to stop my mind from racing. My heart pounding. The intense fucking anxiety and constant daydreaming of overdosing. Maybe it took the edge off. I‚Äôm not getting fucking shit out of it.

So, if I were to crush up some Xanax and boof it... would it work? I guess chemically, I‚Äôm not even looking to get high, I‚Äôd love to get high, but I want to be able to take .5-.75 and just.. get the most out of it. I don‚Äôt know what will make it most worth my while.

Any advice on copping too... as far as I‚Äôm concerned I call, go where he says, he walks up to the car and it‚Äôs  quick exchange, then I high tail the fuck out of that place. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just nervous.

If anyone would like to talk by the way... please pm me. I know it‚Äôs desperate. I feel so alone. I‚Äôve been sitting in my bed for days... I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the last time I ate. I just feel sick. I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Nothing gives me joy...I cry and sleep all day. The minutes drag on. I can‚Äôt fucking take this.

By tonight I‚Äôll have my dope if everything goes well. And then I‚Äôll have to feel better...right? Oh god. I need to.

I don‚Äôt know how much I can take anymore. I‚Äôm weak.",1518301139.0

We binged for a few days a few times and fell in love with it, after abusing stims on and off for 1,5 years together but still maintaining control.

 We took a 8-11week break after the few binges, the last one being before the halfway point of summer. Then we started chipping, using once a week, usually 40-150mg used between us per session (most of the time all nighters because oxy keeps us awake)

We succesfully chipped until january, but started using almost daily in early january. Its now the night between saturday and sunday and we last used on wednesday so we managed to go to school. This is the only break longer than 1day we have had since early january.

Thursday and friday we just laid on the sofa as we couldnt get ourselves up and felt super depressed, have been taking a little bit of benzos to make it more bearable.

We were supposed to get an OC80 tonight but the dealer stopped answering, mayby this is a sign to continue not using, mayby not. We will probably try to cop some oxy tomorrow.

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I have always known that he deals with severe pain on a daily basis. He was born with a deformity in his hip that causes the joint and socket to slowly disintegrate over time. He will eventually need a hip replacement. He‚Äôs also been in two serious motorcycle accidents in the last 10 years. The most recent one was about 3 years ago, and he almost died. He had a punctured lung and shattered his kneecap along with injuring several vertebrae. He was in the hospital for about a week and out of work for several months. He was given pain medication in the hospital but when he got out he was drug tested before the doctor would refill his prescription and he failed for weed. So the doctor gave him Motrin which he never took. I know this is true because I read the paperwork, even I was like wtf. As far as I know he has no legitimate prescriptions for any opiates. 

He is the kind of guy that doesn‚Äôt like to show weakness and tries to be very masculine and macho in that sense. I know that he is in pain every day because I hear him whimpering in the morning when he thinks I‚Äôm asleep. He‚Äôs becoming more immobile and after work he just comes home and sits on the couch smoking weed until he goes to bed. He‚Äôs very stubborn and is terrified of the doctor so he just ‚Äútoughs it out‚Äù and refuses to talk to me about it (which is another big but unrelated problem in our relationship). So when he exhibits the behavior I‚Äôm about to describe and I ask him wtf is up he just says he‚Äôs ‚Äúfine.‚Äù 

Now I personally don‚Äôt do opiates, and I actually think I‚Äôm allergic because they make me feel really sick and weird and itchy every time I take them. However, I‚Äôve seen people nodding off and have had friends that abuse them, so I feel like I know what it looks like. Over the past 3 or 4 months he‚Äôs been acting really fucking suspect and it seems like he‚Äôs fucked up for the following reasons:

He comes home from work and immediately goes into the bathroom for like 45 minutes. When I ask him what he‚Äôs doing he‚Äôs says he‚Äôs taking a shit and that I need to leave him alone. Ok, that sounds plausible, but still weird to me since it‚Äôs like the same exact time frame like 4 days out of the week.
 
He just passes out on the couch, like head back mouth open passed out. It doesn‚Äôt seem like regular ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù and for someone that claims to only smoke weed (he never drinks) it‚Äôs seems really fucking odd to me. It gets to the point that I have to shake him and then he wakes up. Sometimes for a minute then goes right back to ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù or is just awake. 

His mother is prescribed Vicodin and I know he ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù takes one for his pain. He claims to only take it when it‚Äôs so bad that he can‚Äôt move. He frequently gets very defensive when questioned and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fucking junkie.‚Äù 

He‚Äôs a generally grumpy dude, but sometimes he just seems really high and way happier than usual. I‚Äôve been chalking that up to the fact that he‚Äôs a pothead but my gut is telling me something else is happening. 

He‚Äôs also constantly broke despite working a full time job. It‚Äôs not a great job, it‚Äôs in a kitchen, but still. You should have some money and I don‚Äôt think weed and your car insurance costs your entire paycheck. 

His general demeanor lately has been really uncharacteristic. Like extremely angry and just not giving a fuck about me or anything really. This past weekend was my birthday and he passed out on the couch at like 8pm with his head back and his mouth open. I kept checking his breathing and waking him up because it scared me. I told him all of this and how I think he was on something and he laughed and said he was ‚Äútired.‚Äù Wtf.

I‚Äôm not a fucking idiot and I kind of think I already know this is what‚Äôs happening, but I would like some outside validation. Like I said, I don‚Äôt do opiates and idk if some people just sleep like that or if it‚Äôs indicative of being on something. I just want to say that I‚Äôm not judging anyone that does this, but I‚Äôm scared for him and I need to know if this is what I‚Äôm dealing with. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply. 

TLDR

Boyfriend passes out all the time, acts weird, has chronic pain issues and I think he‚Äôs abusing opiates but I don‚Äôt know for sure. ",1518467824.0

I guess he thought he was gonna give them fucked up ones to me but I didn't want them cause I felt sketched about them.  Anyways after about 10 or 15 minutes I went up to his house actually which was a bad idea I should of told him to meet me at the gas station again. So this black guy comes back out gets in the car and the first thing I see in his hand is a baggie of the E8s my eyes are focused on them and not even him. All the sudden this black guy says ""just give me the money"" I said ""what do you mean?"" He then pulls out a glock shows me that there is a round in the chamber. Sooo at the point I was trying to stay calm, I also had my Ruger SR9 on my side and my CCW he could not see that at all. So I say ""you gonna shoot me if I don't give you this money?"" He said ""nah I ain't gonna do anything if you just give me the money."" So now I'm like fuck it I don't know this guy, I don't wanna get shot let me give this little $90 so he can get the hell out my car. I wanted to just get out the car turn around draw my gun and shoot his ass through the window but that would of looked like a drug deal gone bad or some shit plus the gun was still on me. So when I did hand him the money he was like nah that ain't all you got.. So I gave this other 10.00 in my pocket I also dropped my phone between the seat so he wouldn't try and get that and i left my wallet at home since I was just gonna be 5 minutes. So after he got that 10 he got out and started waking back into the house. I thought at that moment should I pull gun out and at least try and wound him in the leg while he isn't looking? I didn't want shoot him In the back as much as I wanted to I know that was a big no no. So honestly I just let it walk cause either way if I shot him and the police came wondering why I shot him I had no legitimate reason why i did other then he pulled a gun on me.. there's a always a reason. I also thought if I did shoot him and the police came I was gonna tell them I was meeting him to buy something off the App letgo, I had no messaging proof for that though.  I honestly don't know if i did the right thing or not. I wasn't gonna call the law after that situation.. Idk i was calm during the situation kind of but my mind was blank that's the first time anything like that has ever happened to me. My life is more valuable then a $100 cause I didn't know that guy I didn't know if he was gonna shoot me or not.. So idk if I did the right thing or the wrong thing. Has anyone else had a situation like this before? ",1518458686.0

Yes and if that isn't stupid enough, I have gotten to the point of taking 400mg+ a day. I know.. you heard that right.

I know there's people here who don't think lope has a withdrawal but it does.. and it's bad.  I dosed high one day when I was going thru another drug withdrawal and found that I felt pretty good, which was surprising.

Ever since then the doses ramped up pretty quickly. The sad part is I read the stories about people dying and all the heart problems and started doing this AFTER.

Think I was going ok for awhile and then I kept experiencing severe weakness and shortness of breath that lasted months, still not enough to stop me. My family thinks I'm sober, and I have put on a good impression for awhile but I'm broken.

Not broken enough of course to stop taking it, but broken enough to where I'm starting to avoid responsibilities more and more, so I know it's a matter of time before it gets bad. 

At least with my other addictions I eventually could come out about it after feeling defeated, but how the fuck can you tell anyone ""Yeah I'm addicted to this anti diarrhea drug and have been for the past year"". The withdrawals are absolutely insane and I only pasted 2 weeks before caving, and not once in those 2 weeks did they seem to start to diminish.

I've had suicide attempts years ago, but don't have the balls to go through those again, at least explicitly.

This is well documented in my medical records and doctors have even said I'm basically at the end of the road as far as conventional treatment goes. If I see a PM doctor how likely am I to get decent meds (not tramadol). I do have a history of opiate addiction (not something in my records because I don't tell my doctors). Just looking for relief, but to be completely honest with ya'll having a steady supply of some oxy would be nice (this is REALLY not my main motivation though).

I just ask that before you go forward with whatever decision or thought you have in your head, just stop for a moment and consciously and figuratively take a step back, reconsider and think about that action, DEEPLY. Think about what its going to do for you right now, in 5 minutes, 30 minutes, a few hours, how its going to impact tomorrow and the day after, how its going to impact this day next month, how its going to impact the other aspects of your life that you don't currently have on the forefront of your thought process... like your relationships, your finances, your mental health, your physical appearance, even your appetite! Your ability and desire to do things like building new relationships, set and to achieve goals, go to the gym, eat properly, provide for the ones you love, be there for the ones who need you, be able to react in emergency situations, this list can go on forever. But im just saying, just for a moment, consciously/figuratively/even literally take a step back, and think long, deep, and hard (ha-ha for whoever makes the joke) about where the decision will or where it could take you. If ANY of the conclusions that you come to of where the decision could potentially take you are places that you dont or would never want to be at, that right there should be enough information and all you need to recognize that the decision has more bad than good to it, and maybe you'll pass it up this time. There is always next time. And hopefully next time you do this same exact thing and come to the same exact conclusion.

I can tell you one thing that is factual: You DO NOT want to live the lifestyle of an addict, whether it be opiates, stimulants, alcohol, etc., you do not want to live this life. Facts. You might think that it will never happen to you.. and hey, maybe it won't, BUT it probably will and youll wish you would have taken this advice. I wish I took this advice about a year ago, and im not even in a bad situation or in very deep, but one thing is for sure, and that is that i am in it. For the first time, i am actively in the life of an addict.

Also one other random protip: NEVER SHOOT COKE. Me, i have always been a downers person, never enjoyed stimulants much at all, always made me feel shitty that night and the next day physically and just never felt much out of sniffing coke, no matter how good or how much i did. One night i was in a tinychat and i was told that IV coke is an ENTIRELY different drug than when it is snorted. I thought what the heck, i dont like stims theres no way i could get hooked on that, besides ive sold coke for years and never got hooked on it, i never even do it when i have free coke left over from ounces. After i shot coke, it became the most fiendish high i have ever chased my god. I am not aware of the dangers of how much is needed in a single shot to overdose or how much over a certain period of time, and i dont even enjoy the high that much, but since i no longer feel much a rush from shooting H, and the immediate rush and physical/auditory changes i feel from shooting a good dose of coke have made me practically mix a shot every 15-30 minutes until its gone at any point that i have coke. ive easily shot at least a quarter ounce of coke over the last week, and thats probably lowballing. STAY AWAY. 

Tomorrow i am going to my first NA meeting. I am seeing a therapist on the 17th. And i will continue to fight this addiction until the day that i die.

Please, just for a moment, really, seriously, reconsider.",1518440502.0

About 20 more mins later I could definitely feel a small opiate buzz but definitely not stronger than one oxy has given me before. We decided that we should just finish off the rest of the pill. We also decided that rolling a joint would be a good course of action. By the time I was almost done rolling, I could definitely feel the buzz. We finished off the pill and started smoking the joint, sharing it with his roommate. I didn‚Äôt want to smoke too much cuz at this point I was in my happy place and I didn‚Äôt want the weed high to overpower the buzz.

I'm breaking down.","I quit IV Herion 8 days ago, I did cave and snort one bag because of horrible stomach pain thats from a virus I got about tuesday/wednesday. TBH I've had 3 stomach conditions for years and since about last june it just seems to have gotten worse. Doctors can't find anything even with MRI's and Catscans, the works. I've had two tell me they see this sometimes and they say with abdominal pain it's tricky. They know I'm in pain and not faking, but sometimes they just can't fix it ever. Both said it's possible I may just have to live with it forever. I'm only 28. While this bug has put me in so bad pain I've slept one night in a week and only a few hours and eat about half a cliff bar a day. Even when I haven't had this virus the pain is less but it never, ever, goes away. I'd give anything to have like knee pain or something but this constant burning knife in my stomach is hard to imagine living with forever. That's really about 80% of the reason I was using H and stealing even while on probation which I've violated. There's only so much I can take. Recently me and my coppin partner/partner in making money how we can just haven't been able to make half what we used to and the 9/10 dope that used to be around just dissapeared. I was shooting bundles and giving the feeling a 1/10. I just got tired of being dopesick 50% so I quit. I don't even care about the one bag today I sniffed. It was just to get a couple hours of relief. I don't plan on going back on H.

I know this will sound weird but while my buddy is still struggling to get off the garbage dope, I started smoking crack which to everyones surprise helped me quick dope. I'm not really into stimulants and it's definitely not my drug of choice but theres so much chaos in my life right now even 5 minutes of a dopamine rush is bliss and I was attracted to the non physically addicting part.

My fiance dumped me almost the same day I quit H. She never found out about my addiction. It was other issues that caused the split. I still love her and avoided contact until wednesday which was a mistake. She acted happy as a peach(she was faking which I will explain later). That crushed me. My mom is sick of my addiction even though I don't live with her and now wants nothing to do with me. Literally the only family member who still had my back after I went to prison for felony assault which I got for fighting back when my brother tried to murder me. My state has no self defense laws.

Every day gets worse. This virus is 4 times worse than my dopesick was. I know its hard to believe because IV dopesick is bad but thats really how bad this virus is. Even though I should be in bed, mentally I can't sit in my room alone. So sick as fuck, I go around making money in non moral ways and buy crack while my friend gets dope.

I think the only person who gives a shit about me is that addict friend. In 6 months, even when I just met him as a middle man, he has never beat me out of a dollar. We split everything 50/50 and we trust eachother completely. I've pawned everything but my computer.

Last night I couldn't breathe in my room and slept downstairs. When i woke up 2 hours later, I went to take my meds. I've been prescribed klonopin for 10 years because I got a brain injury in a car accident and it just fucked my circuits. No non benzo helps at all. I should have had about 23 in my bottle and when I went to take it there was fucking 3. I had a problem in the summer and noticed a few were going missing here and there but never like this. I have to go to the hospital in the morning and hope they give me the 5/6 day supply I need until my refill. In the summer when whichever roommate stole a bit too much I was only 1 day short and the hospital was really cool and gave it to me based on my word and I was out in 20 minutes. I'm hoping since this is only the 2nd time they won't give me a problem but its also 5/6 worth of kpins instead of 1 and I really don't want to have to file a police report which is what my doctor requires if I go to her. I live with 4 people but it's a big house and I rarely see the 2 other renters. The other 2 are my landlady and her BF and I trust them and let them know the situation. One other renter is an ex addict and the other is just really weird. She thinks its the ex addict but hes been clean 8 years and I just hate to imagine him doing me dirty like that. Benzos are not a medicine to fucking take from someone considering the WD possibilities.

To top it off, my ex fiance texted me about an hour ago she tried to kill herself yesterday. She wouldn't tell me much but it sounds like she tried to cut her wrists and her brother just happened to come into her room at the right time. Instead of being supportive her family screamed at her and told her she was fucking crazy.

The breakup is so fresh and once I get my shit together she said there's a chance we could try again(this was wednesday). This is the second time I've been engaged. I tried to tell her to talk to me because I know that feeling of wanting to end it all very, very well and I would understand. She still wouldn't open up, said she wants to try again a different way and then cut me off the phone.

I've already had a hard time keeping it together lately. As it is, next month, because I have a nice PO, hes only recommending and increase in probation level instead of jail time even though I've gotten two charges. As long as the judge agrees ill get another year on strict probation which if i carry on the way I am now I'll violate very fast. I have 8 years backup time plus whatever they'd give me for the new charges.

I will die before I do that much time locked up. The time I did already broke me and made me a worse person. Jail hurts more than rehabilitates.

I think just hearing the attempted suicide tonight was my breaking point. I broke down and cried and could barely breathe. If i got a call she does it again and does succeed then I honestly don't know if I could handle it. I want to marry this girl and she wants to die at 23 because she's having a bad week?

The first initial push stung like a mofo but didn't really burn after that sting when I tried pushing it in very very slow to see if the sting would happen again. It is kind of strange because I kept puling the plunger back to make sure i was still registered throughout. I went really slow and injected the H probably over 60 seconds. 

1) I have hit an artery before (Or nerve) and it also stung and burned in those situations so I've had to pull the whole rig out. There was one time I was very naive (sometimes still am) and kept pushing the plunger in while it burned but whole area was so numb from it I didn't feel much pain when doing that. (1A) - but Do you guys think shooting into an artery would sting throughout the whole shot? (1B) And do you think it's possible that the needle tip was just partially in my vein and out at the same time where it could register blood, but also 'miss' partially if injected?

Not sure if it matters but the vein I used is really small. It kind of runs over the pink knuckle and is barely visible. 

2) After the shot, the area around it, about a 1 inch circumference, became alittle raised and random raised bumps showed up on my wrist and forarm also. Do you think that's an allergic reaction, or from a partial miss or definitely artery hit? Besides those raised areas, nothing else is puffy like when I hit an artery before. Also, nothing really hurts.

3) Random question I always wondered, When you guys put the cotton in the dope to draw up, how big of a piece do you use and do you actually stick the needle tip into the piece of cotton or just kind of push the tip against it and apply pressure while drawing it up? 

Thanks all! Enjoy the rest of the night. ",1518413101.0

I'll take 2 or 3 ex lax and all it does (with coke, without does nothing) is bring some out with much more still in there. I've been constipated for way over a week now doing this sometimes and I'm really concerned. I went to the ER for this issue a couple weeks ago and was given Golyte and it cleaned me out great. Nothing at all works now and the only thing I haven't tried is Movantik

I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow or very soon to try and get Movantik. How do I go about getting prescribed this? I'm worried I'll be rejected since I Use fent... was thinking maybe I could lie and say Im on methadone instead.

I just really need help with this problem will someone chime in?? This fent constipation  is so hard to deal with and I want to try Movantik

I can get regular Narcan, would that be like Movantik if I couldn't get it for withdrawal to make me go to the bathroom??? :((

 I'm a dope user, but I'm currently in the process of quitting (perpetually so). I was using basically every day, maybe a half gram to a gram or so, but it was pretty bunk shit, so take that with a grain of salt, it wasn't a HUGE habit or anything. So I went four days without using and my withdrawal symptoms were basically subsiding, RLS was subsiding big, I could actually get comfortable, still getting the chills and having diarrhea, but for the most part a mild day four. Well I used like 0.2 that night and went like two more days without using, but I was definitely experiencing WD symptoms slightly worse than I was on day four prior, but still not bad, just sweating like a mfer at night.

So yesterday I needed to work a job outside for 8 hours straight. I'm starting to umpire youth baseball. So even though the WD symptoms weren't horrible by any means, the last thing I wanted was to be having the chills and hot/cold sweats while being outside in the cold and wind for 8 hours straight.

So, I dosed about 0.25mg of sub, and it was enough to make me feel good, like I was completely clean. No euphoria or anything, just clean. Well it has now been 38 hours since I dosed that and I'm starting to get the chills again, so obviously I'm starting to WD from the sub.

I start a new job on Thursday the 15th and *really* do not want to be having any WD symptoms when I start. In y'all's experience, do you think I should be fine by then? Do you think the WD I'll experience up until then will even be that severe? I know sub WD is supposed to peak around 72 hours, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad since I'm half way there and only have minimal symptoms, but I also know that sub WD can last a really long time, and I'm worried about not being over it by Thursday, or worst case scenario, having the WD be so drawn out that I don't start feeling really shitty until the middle of the week.

I got prescribed Suboxone 8mg per day and am supposed to see a Sub doc on Wednesday. 

I also was taking 6 grams per day of Phenibut on average along with ~30 - 40 grams of Kratom before detox. During the 6 days I was in detox, they pumped me with a shitload of Phenobarbital for the Phenibut piece of the puzzle - 194.4 mgs for a few days, then a quick taper down to 64.8mg the day of discharge last Thursday. They then set me free with 5 32.4 mg pills as needed basically. I took two (64.8 mg on Friday), and on accident (seriously) took three yesterday 97.2mg. I meant to save the last for tonight but forgot I'd already taken two, to make the comedown smoother but whatever. I also was feeling incredibly anxious last night so I broke down and took 3 grams of Phenibut. Obviously I slept but this seems incredibly dangerous.  

Point is, has anyone else here taken Phenibut with their opiate of choice? I really don't see myself just not taking any more Phenibut suddenly just because I got a weeks worth of Phenobarbital tapered extremely quickly. I'm sure I can skip the day dose of Phenibut. I can prob go down to 1.5 or 2 grams of Phenibut at night and taper down. At detox they didn't seem concerned giving me a hardcore, long acting barbituate in high doses with 8mg Suboxone - they only monitored my vitals in the morning, and let me sleep on huge doses of it alone in my room. I was a fucking total zombie the first two/three days: no memory of what was going on. I'm with it now and trying to figure out a plan here.

Any thoughts? I don't know what to do exactly. I feel like they just staved off the Phenibut w/d with a barbituate and now I'm on an opiate that causes respiratory depression which Kratom didn't. Problem with Kratom was it was giving my tinnitus, and it was feeling unsustainable taking dose after dose since it had a short window of action.

Been off the shit for almost 2 years, consuming kratom daily.
Call me sober, call me relapsed. IDGAF I like kratom and I have grown exponentially since its use.

It is a sort of coping mechanism I'll give you that, but when you've stared the devil in its eyes, any sane person would need some help coping.

I used to be your plug, not literally, but I did supply about 7 counties in my metropolitan area with high grade h, e, pot, bars, psychs, whatever. I was ""the man"" 19 with more money than I care to admit, and was well known and respected by many.
All of that changed.

My PIC caught a federal trafficking case, and it just so happened I was supposed to go down with him. They had a case on me, and my lawyer told me to lay fucking low or I'm going down.

Well I quit dealing, but my dope habit sprawled out of control.

My girlfriend of 6 years began having physical arguements. Bitch wanted me to give her more spending money every month (AS IF 7k on bullshit every month isn't enough money).

Anywho, one day I lose it. My PIC called my mom from prison and told her I needed help. I'll never forget that day. I remember I smoked a blunt and prepped my shot, I stand up and look in the mirror.
I just see an empty skeleton of death.
I didn't want to die. I just wanted to have fun and feel good.

I know im rambling, I just need to vent.

So now fast forward 2 rehabs and 4 IOPS, I am currently a year away from graduating, my GPA is a 3.8 and I have a lovely ""normie"" girlfriend.

Problem you might ask? I'm still a junky. I occasionally slip myself some etizolam once every few weeks knowing good and damn well where it leads me.
I am not sure about you all, but our society is so fucked in the head.
I just had an altercation with a girl who told me anyone who uses drugs should be sent to a CONCENTRATION CAMP. It took everything inside of me to fight back what I really wanted to say to her.
God i dont know guys. I just feel like each and every day I am slowly losing it and eventually I am gonna snap and relapse, because thats what I know best.
My parents and I have never had a close relationship. Dad wasn't around until my teens, and was a huge factor in my drug habits.
The shittiest part? I tell my parents (divorced) everyday (well not so much anymore) that I've always wanted to have a happy family and be close with them. They never reciprocate.

My mom and I are decently close, and she never gave up on me, even when shit got rough so I know one day we will be in a good place.
but my dad? Everyday I debate whether I should block that side of the families phone number.
They never genuinely take interest in me, and when I seldom do go to their home they are quite honestly just mean people. I am part of a larger family and the way they treat the younger kids, and other people in general is just not something I want in my life.

But hey, I'm off drugs right? Thats all they ever cared about. They dont give a flying fladoodle whats going on inside my head. They just want that clean piss test.

Fucking christ what a rant. I don't have any support in my life, nobody to talk about this shit and if I learned anything its that I need to get this shit out and into the world.

So for anyone whos read this far. Thank you - I really take comfort in that, and I hope that things in your life are going well. If theres anything to take from this, I guess let it be to tell those you care about, that you love them. Because some of us didn't get to.

Peace

I also have a story a old friend  from back in the day told me. He says him and another were in the hood, ran into a guy looking to score like 5 buns/brick of H. Guy says to them ""listen I just got outta rehab about 3 months ago and been clean but I wanna find the best dope around so help me out and I'll throw yous a few $'s or a half a bun"". Dude I know says ok( but his plan with his boy is fucked up!), basically take him to grab stamps that are mostly fent so when dude falls out they'll dip his pockets and rob him of his dope, rigs,$, etc... So after copping they take him to an abando, shoot up. Dude falls out as planned, needle in arm. While dipping pockets grabs his phone and when he does the phone rings, it says mom calling(trying to find her son, so he answers the phone. Mother says hello where's ""whoever"" the sons name is? he tells her he's in an abando, and oh btw he's dying!!!! The abando is at (insert address here). Him and his boy take everything and leave him in the abando!!! Smfh 

I asked him if he knows if dude died, did his mom call 911, did paramedics come fast enough? He told me when they came back around from the store cops, paramedics were there. And the coroners were carrying the body out by that time... So he died! I said why didn't you just burn him and keep it moving? Why not just befriend him, or atleast call 911 for him? Still would of walked away with everything as planned?!?! He said ""I felt bad a little, but not that bad, I really don't gaf at this point...""

 We use to be friends and knew each other for years before his H use... Once he started H he turned into the biggest scumbag there is! I also use H at this point but would never even think to do anything like that and would like to think I'd never would!!!

A few people are scrutinizing me for posting this story saying I'm a scumbag, looser, piece of shit, etc...  I posted this for one main reason and that is to warn everyone to not be so trusting since I've read here quite a few times how people cold cop, and use middle men/strangers they meet on the street that'll do anything for a few $'s, a fix, and just a quick come up!!!",1518381742.0

Isn't the concentration of the substance always the same, so you technically can't overdose if you always take the same amount/dose of the substance? Or do people get carried away by the high of the drug and they shoot up too much just so they can enjoy the 'high' for a longer time? I am curious to know, because I have basically no idea how overdoses happen.

**EDIT**: I don't know if I made myself clear. I don't even know how to explain, since I literally know nothing about hard drugs. I want to know how people get to the point where they overdose.

I'm sure most of you know the song ""sex and candy"" by them but I don't look at them as being a one hit wonder band. You guys should check some of their songs out. Wave motion gun, poppies, opium, sherry Frasier, and hotter than the sun are amazing songs by them. Oh and deadly handsome man. I find it interesting they have 3 songs directly about opiates. 

Also the song ""pool shark"" by Sublime. He says ""tying on the dinosaur tonight, it used to be so cool"". I never heard of that before.

I hate that the world keeps on going I hate that we have to just move on and live our lives and that a lot of people get forgotten.

Think of all the mods JUST THE MODS that have passed I don‚Äôt know the number offhand of how many mods there have been but at least three have passed from opiates what other sub Reddit do you think has to deal with this r/cancer maybe?

Please if you‚Äôre in a bad place if you‚Äôre feeling sad and worthless and don‚Äôt want to go on please just remember that there is someone that cares.  I care.

If you need Narcan or even if you need clean rigs because its somehow impossible for you to get them which happens all the time, message one of the mods we‚Äôll point you in the right direction or send you some.

In a 5 pannel drug test that has no specific OXY test only a standard opiates pannel. Would I be right to assume that I would have to take a lot to fail the test. Generally it's only insufflating a 20mg or a 10mg of ox once or twice a week max. I'm assuming that given the half life and the cutoff for semi synthetics in a standard test that I would have to be extremely unlucky to exceed the detection threshold (which seems to be much higher without the specific Oxy pannel)?

It all starts at an unfamiliar house. A bunch of chicks are upstairs getting costumes on for some Halloween party. They invite me and offer me a costume, I refuse. I leave the house and drive for a while, park on the street in some faceless city and start walking.. I see a blonde haired, skinny dude walk out of a building. He's bobbing his head as if he's listening to music. I follow him. He reaches into his pocket for his phone and out drops a colorful mix of baggies onto the ground. He keeps walking. I pick up the bags and catch up to him, tap on his shoulder. He mutters something without looking at me and continues to dance down the street. I put the bags in my pocket to investigate later. I return to the building he came from and open the door. It's an elevator.

The buttons go in order of 1, 4, 5, 7. I press 1. The doors close slowly but then the elevator starts to rush downward, then sideways, then upward, then downward again.. Finally the door opens. I scramble out into a dark hall of elevators to be met by ghoulish creature. It looks like a thousand-eyed woman-centaur on a grasshopper's body. The walls are a dark, dried-blood red. The creature has a clipboard. She asks if I'm lost. I tell her I just want to go back home. She says I need to go to the first floor. I tell her that's the button I pushed. She says to try the ""F"" button. I'm nervous. I go back into the elevator and press the ""F"" and close my eyes. The elevator sways like a goddamn ship, then the door opens. I'm in a dimly lit bar that only serves coffee. Everyone stops what they're doing and looks at me. The bartender is another one of those freaky cricket-ladies. She asks me if I'm lost. I tell her yes. She asks if I'd like a coffee. I refuse and go back to the elevator. I press ""5."" Fucking roller coaster this time. The door opens and I'm on a grassy knoll in the middle of a sunny park. The elevator stands alone in the middle of the field awkwardly but I think nothing of it. I start walking. Time to check out those bags I scored on the ground! Fuck yeah - They're fat and full of dope! I need to find somewhere to do them. I start walking faster along a path into the woods. A group of guys spot me. It's the dancing dude that dropped his bags and his twin brother. They start questioning me. One of them trips me. I scramble to get away. Fuck, now I'm not going to get to do this bag! I swear it wasn't me..

And then I wake up.",1518518859.0

I hope, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I hope you can find God or something and want to get better. I hope you do get better. I hope someone loves you so hard like we did.

Get puppies and another cat. A huge house for all of these new lives. Cars and amazing jobs. I love you. And I always fucking will. I just can‚Äôt keep watching you do this to yourself anymore.

(And Although a job was offered, they never mentioned anything about a drug test, do you guys think I'm in the clear for that or 'Surprise Surprise, please give us your saliva/urine sample"" when I come in Thursday?)

So, I've read a lot of people attest to Kratom for taking away up to 90% withdrawal pain. I tried it once and puked it a few moments later. (I get nauseous, gag/heave when withdrawaing for some reason). I think I will try mixing it or taking it via capsules this time, if yall suggest it being better than Tramadol for H withdrawals. Does anyone have experience with Tram? Do yall think it'd be better than Kratom or both about the same?

I relapsed then and there. Free, friend or not, that's a relapse and unfortunately, it didn't even prevent an ER visit I ended up there later that night. Thus far I've taken 35mgs of the 100mgs I have in 3.5ish days. I hate myself right now so much for it.

I have been using kratom pretty much daily for about a year and a half, and that has helped keep my cravings at bay for the most part. today I decided I would try and chip knowing that I have an emergency stash of subs and a good amount of kratom to help keep some degree of control. 

anyhow, I very carefully took a dose earlier this evening (with the friend who helped me scored from a reliable plug) spacing out each tiny bump over 15-30 minutes increments. all told I had about 4 small bumps before I reached what I guess you could call a high, but it was mostly drowsiness and me staving off my paranoia about taking too much. I also had a dose of kratom this morning and I‚Äôm sure that also interfered with the ‚Äúhigh‚Äù to a large degree. 

my question is, if I was going to have any sort of adverse reaction would it be apparent by now? I feel fine albeit still drowsy, but I‚Äôm scared that if I lie down and go to sleep some reactive effects might creep up. I should note that I‚Äôve never OD‚Äôd before and want to take every precaution to avoid it (duh) even if it means not fully getting for and waiting till a day where I don‚Äôt have anything else in my system. also I‚Äôm transitioning medically right now (HRT) and on a dose of 2mg Estradiol and 100mg of Spiro, but I don‚Äôt know of any negative interactions. am I good to go to bed tonight lol? 

I just want other people‚Äôs read on this, it‚Äôs been so long and even though I‚Äôve been super intentional and cautious, I want to make sure I‚Äôm as safe as possible (without just not doing dope in the first place). I realize this will come off as reckless to some of you and I understand why, but there are a lot of reasons for my decisions and I‚Äôm well aware it‚Äôs not the best one. I‚Äôm not saying spare me the chiding but please know I‚Äôve considered the reality of my situation and I‚Äôm not thrilled about it.

So this is kinda opiate relates but maybe someone has experience here. 


Had a big time pill habit. Worst it got was around 150mg a day for 4 years. I stopped that by moving to Kratom for a year which obviously is similar to simply kicking the can down the road. Today I could proudly say I‚Äôm 7 months clean with no subs. Strictly lame ass sobriety. 

I still have PAWS, yanno the depression every now and then as all the physicals are gone. 

BUT I have a xanex and addy script I just got. I took about 2 mg of xans and 40 mg of addys. I feel so much better and way more productive. I‚Äôve takin this combo in the past when I was about 3 months clean and it made all the wd‚Äôs go away. 

My question is, once I go thru this xan and addy binge, u think it‚Äôll reactive some of my opi wd‚Äôs?? This may be an outrageous question but I‚Äôm nervous I may have mild wd‚Äôs similar to that of opiates. Anyone out there know, any help would be super dope.

Those who have had their share of heroin AND fentanyl withdrawals. Was one worse than the other? 
Say you've been a steady H user but suddenly the heroin in your city went ghost So you've been copping fentanyl (or vice versa). Do the WD's feel worse? come on faster? Last longer/shorter? 

I've been doing ONLY street fentanyl (not sure which analog) for about 2 years. I never tried heroin first, fentanyl was already full swing and H was/is hard to come by around here. Lately I've been getting an H/fent mix, I love it. It's a light-medium brown color, powder/chunky, vinegar smell. 

My question is: When it comes to withdrawals, Am I better off doing this mix rather than just fentanyl. Or would it actually be worse because it's 2 substances? Or would it even make a difference? Ideally I'd like to do pure H but that won't happen.

My question is, does anyone else get very intense tremors and muscle twitching while high? And even after they're high? It's really only happened during my last two uses, but I still find it very strange. I just sobered up maybe four hours ago, and I'm still shaking like a motherfucker. In fact, it is much worse now than when I was high. At least then it would only come in phases, unlike now, as I've been jittering and twitching non-stop for the past hour or so. A part of me is considering that maybe, just maybe it's some sort of mild withdrawal, but with the casual nature of my use (I went on a week long binge about a month and a half ago, didn't experience any withdrawal. Didn't do anything again until two days ago when I took 200 mgs of codeine, and then the same dose tonight), it seems very unlikely.

I had made a thread about this situation a few months ago. basically this 18 yr old girl hayley moore at this college near me (JMU) was dating this guy, joseph fondaco. they were doing dope and the girl ODs and dies. he doesnt get charged until her family runs a campaign to just ruin this kids life and they end up managing a way to get him charged with fucking capital murder!! the girls parents accept no responsibilty that their daughter was a junkie and blame this kid instead. sickeninig

well looks like he got a plea deal reduced to manslaughter, 25 year sentence all suspended but 6 months. hed been held without bail for about 4 months now so in a couple months he will be free

this goes to all parents of addicts - yes it is sad when a young person dies due to drugs. BUT IT IS NOT FAIR TO RUIN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BECAUSE YOUR KID WAS A JUNKIE AND YOU DONT WANT TO BELIEVE IT

here is a somewaht updated link regarding the case. http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Leesburg-man-charged-in-connection-to-the-death-of-JMU-student-Hailey-Moore-445906603.html

when i posted this last time you guys helped to flood comments to both WHSV, the Daily News Record, and JMUs newspaper The Breeze. both publications had biased, unfair articles which basically blamed Fondaco. would it be possible for us as a community to once again stand up for justice and write some letters to editors, emails, or opinion pieces? it worked very well last time and i was happy r/drugs can see the truth.

I am very happy he will be out of jail soon, fuck that girl's family is all i gotta say. sucks she died, but that gives them no right to crucify this kid. i hope everyone here can sympathize with this kid",1518487386.0

What gauge would you recommend for IV use? I'm also going to try IM ketamine, what gauge would you recommend for this? I have ordered 27g, 3/4"" and 23g 1"" needles.

When I previously tried to IV, it was stupid difficult because I used a 26g and I didn't want to shoot without registering, and making sure I could draw back blood. From what I've read, the reason why this was so damn difficult is because blood is usually too thick for a 26g and it was pretty much impossible to pull back the plunger.

But when I look at what people use to IV, I got the impression that most people use very high gauges, but this means you just have to be sure you hit a vein and shoot it slowly, right? 'cause with a needle that thin, its highly impractical to withdraw blood.

Should I use the 27g for IV, and after being very sure I hit a vein, push slowly and see if I feel it, and if I do, I'm good to go?

so I‚Äôve been using heroin daily nonstop for half a year and this last week I switched to opium (the form I cannot name on here) because I ran out and couldnt get more dope. Opium withdrawal‚Äôs peak symptoms last over 2 weeks, the longest withdrawal I‚Äôve ever experienced, with the absolute worst symptoms at day 3 or 4. Never been through heroin withdrawal but I imagine its shorter.

I‚Äôm planning on cold turkeying soon. When I cold turkey, am I going to go through opium withdrawal (long) or heroin withdrawal (shorter)? 

My logic is that since the heroin is out of my system, I‚Äôll go through opium withdrawal. If I go through opium withdrawal, will it feel like I was using opium for half a year (how long I‚Äôve been on heroin for)? ",1518477641.0

Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time. 

But before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us. 

The fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him. 

Eventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off. 

Then withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me. 

It's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol.

Bud and his running partner, aka ya boy right here, can hustle fine string instruments. Was that one of you guys though, or was Bud right and it was God? Because it worked out rather perfectly. 

By the way if you remember from last post about the guy who was supposedly dying but in such a way that it was not at all considered a medical emergency, here's the update. I totally fucked that off, didn't even see Bud until way later than initially planned. One of the things I had to take care of before going to that trap was with my homegirl, Flail-Bot 3000. She flailed and fuckin flailed and I tried so hard to work with her and ended up leaving her stranded in a rock quarry and way late to the dude who was supposedly dying. Could've lived could've died, I don't know. 

So last night Bud calls me. It was a discouraging day for the guy. If he didn't have concrete, verifiable progress to his moving out of the house by morning he was getting thrown out then and there. With for the most part just a cello to work with, and him and I being in the trade of hard drugs not string instruments, we weren't getting our hopes up. No cello sale then no reliable living, no necessary resources, no being a father to a son, no shelter until jail via racial profiling by the police, etc. Since he considered it his last night at the house and he was just alone in it, he wanted me to come over and spend it with him. I get there, we chainsmoke cigarettes while we have real talk, share stories and try to sell other smaller items for at least a little something. About 30 minutes in I have a sale for a watch I have lined up, another sale for another watch, and a trade, but then I a get *piiinggggggg* ya know, fb messenger? Some rando added me and asked, ""Hey man, how's it going? I heard you have a cello on the cheap I've been trying to get one within my budget."" 

Well fuck me sideways friend, you can bet your own toned taternuts that I sure do! I show Bud the message, he grabs my phone staring it right in the fuckin screen with his eyes lit up accommodated by a huge smile and says, ""Oh my God! Is this real?"" And I'm not fuckin around here, just then his phone gets a *piingggggg* ya know the Facebook thing, yeah. It was another rando contacting him about buying the FUCKING CELLO. Bud and I read it together and in the same tone as 3 seconds before he says, ""Oh my god! What the fuck is happening?"" 

You guys. Seriously please tell me if it was you or what, but within the next 50 minutes after the first ping, we had a total of 9 people hit us up for this cello. 3 hit me and 6 hit him, never met or heard of any of these people. From what we gathered, someone I know knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who mentioned a cheap cello at work where our buyer overheard it. We sold it to the first guy who hit me up 7 hours after he sent message, had the money in hand at 6AM this morning. 

So again. 

I'm not fucking kidding please PM or something because I've never believed in miracles and I don't want to start now. I'm going to see Bud out of state within the next 4 days, and I'm going to miss the absolute shit out of him, but I wouldn't try to chain him here or make him feel bad because he's actively pursuing what he greatly values, which is his 2 year old son. I've been in some horrible, some great, some hilarious some unmentionable positions in my time in the drug scene, but so far this has been the fiasco that I value the most.

For the record, on the way to sell this thing in the early hours of morning driving down the highway, I told him he can for real tell me the actual origins of this cello, it's about to be over so just tell me I absolutely must know. Period. Like it's a thing. All he really could say was, ""I already told you, it just kinda showed up."" I'm pretty sure there's a lesson to be learned from this little cello fiasco, like what they do at the end of South Park episodes, or King of the Hill? Is it persue your greater values even though you're pretty clearly just gonna fuck it up the more you try? I don't know. Either way I'm happy with the way it went. Love you guys and thank you for keeping tuned in with me, I appreciate it.",1518470862.0
