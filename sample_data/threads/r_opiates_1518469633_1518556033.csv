It all starts at an unfamiliar house. A bunch of chicks are upstairs getting costumes on for some Halloween party. They invite me and offer me a costume, I refuse. I leave the house and drive for a while, park on the street in some faceless city and start walking.. I see a blonde haired, skinny dude walk out of a building. He's bobbing his head as if he's listening to music. I follow him. He reaches into his pocket for his phone and out drops a colorful mix of baggies onto the ground. He keeps walking. I pick up the bags and catch up to him, tap on his shoulder. He mutters something without looking at me and continues to dance down the street. I put the bags in my pocket to investigate later. I return to the building he came from and open the door. It's an elevator.

The buttons go in order of 1, 4, 5, 7. I press 1. The doors close slowly but then the elevator starts to rush downward, then sideways, then upward, then downward again.. Finally the door opens. I scramble out into a dark hall of elevators to be met by ghoulish creature. It looks like a thousand-eyed woman-centaur on a grasshopper's body. The walls are a dark, dried-blood red. The creature has a clipboard. She asks if I'm lost. I tell her I just want to go back home. She says I need to go to the first floor. I tell her that's the button I pushed. She says to try the ""F"" button. I'm nervous. I go back into the elevator and press the ""F"" and close my eyes. The elevator sways like a goddamn ship, then the door opens. I'm in a dimly lit bar that only serves coffee. Everyone stops what they're doing and looks at me. The bartender is another one of those freaky cricket-ladies. She asks me if I'm lost. I tell her yes. She asks if I'd like a coffee. I refuse and go back to the elevator. I press ""5."" Fucking roller coaster this time. The door opens and I'm on a grassy knoll in the middle of a sunny park. The elevator stands alone in the middle of the field awkwardly but I think nothing of it. I start walking. Time to check out those bags I scored on the ground! Fuck yeah - They're fat and full of dope! I need to find somewhere to do them. I start walking faster along a path into the woods. A group of guys spot me. It's the dancing dude that dropped his bags and his twin brother. They start questioning me. One of them trips me. I scramble to get away. Fuck, now I'm not going to get to do this bag! I swear it wasn't me..

And then I wake up.",1518518859.0

I just want to say fuck heroin for stealing my first love away from me. He’s alive but the old him, he’s gone. He’s far from here. 7 years. We started dating when I was 14 and you were 15. You took my virginity. You were my best friend. Nothing could stop us. We’ve gone through it all. But you so much more. I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough for this. I’m sorry this is so hard and I couldn’t see it from your point of view. I’m sorry you couldn’t see it from my point of view. I’m sorry for all of the fights. I’m sorry for giving you money I knew I shouldn’t give you and enabling you then bawling my eyes out as soon as you’d walk out the door. I’m sorry watching you overdose on our anniversary ruined me. I’m sorry it ruined you. I’m sorry this is so scary for me and for you. I’m sorry for everything. I’m sorry this has turned me into a bitch. I’m sorry that I hate you when you’re high. I’m sorry I can’t stand this relationship anymore. I’m sorry I tried for so long and I’m sorry you probably feel like I’m giving up on you. I’m sorry that I couldn’t do more to help you. I’m so fucking sorry that I couldn’t do more. If I could give you the world I would. I’d give you everything if I knew it wouldn’t kill you. I’m sorry I want you to live so badly. I’m sorry that you have to play Russian roulette with yourself multiple times a day. I can’t even begin to imagine how scary this is for you. But it’s so scary for me too. 

I can’t wake up every morning wondering if when I walk into our living room if you’re going to be alive. I’m sorry that I make you shower with the door open. Im sorry that I’m so worried about everything you’re doing and if you’re okay warm fed and safe. Im sorry I’m overprotective. I’m sorry I just want my best friend back. I can’t keep cleaning up your vomit in the bathroom or your blood on the counters from your needles. The tape you leave everywhere from your bags. The tiny pieces of paper. 

I just want my best friend back more than anything. I’d give anything for our tickle fights again. For normal sex. For you to be able to finish again. To see you smile genuinely. For you not to be sad or depressed. I’m so sorry you’ve had to steal for this. For you to break your family’s trust and hearts. I’m sorry you feel like you have to hide your life. I’m sorry you have to go through this. I’m so sorry for you. I love you more than fucking anything and I just want you to be okay. 

Two different worlds and minds so far from each other. I’ve never tried a single drug and you’ve experienced them all. I’m just tired of crying myself to sleep at night terrified of the next day for you. This isn’t healthy for either of us and I know I’ve told you that a million times. And I’m sorry for repeating myself again. I just want normalcy and simplicity. I just want you to go to na or rehab again or try to even want to get better again, again. I want you to want to get better more than anything my love. I really do. 

I hope you do. And I hope you get to grow your hair out like you want and that you get to get more tattoos. I hope you get to buy the new electronics that you want. Some new shoes and games. I hope, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart. I hope you can find God or something and want to get better. I hope you do get better. I hope someone loves you so hard like we did. I hope she gives you the world. I hope we meet in another life and we can try this again. Make the babies we always said we’d have, grow old together, have grandchildren. Get puppies and another cat. A huge house for all of these new lives. Cars and amazing jobs. I love you. And I always fucking will. I just can’t keep watching you do this to yourself anymore.

So I started applying for jobs this past weekend and wasn't expecting anything but had a video chat interview today and was offered the job on the spot. I told them I could start next Monday but they said they needed the position to be filled ASAP and wanted me to come in Thursday, Friday and Saturday for training/regular work, 8 hours each day. I wasn't expecting anything so soon because I wanted to take this week to detox and start straight for work next week. However, being that I can't really leverage when I can start, if I accept the job, I'll be in for a rude awakening by Thursday/Friday with withdrawals. (I have 1 dose left of H I will take tomorrow morning). I don't have the funds to get more H, and even if I did, it's not enough to keep going this path so I want to get off. (And Although a job was offered, they never mentioned anything about a drug test, do you guys think I'm in the clear for that or 'Surprise Surprise, please give us your saliva/urine sample"" when I come in Thursday?)

So, I've read a lot of people attest to Kratom for taking away up to 90% withdrawal pain. I tried it once and puked it a few moments later. (I get nauseous, gag/heave when withdrawaing for some reason). I think I will try mixing it or taking it via capsules this time, if yall suggest it being better than Tramadol for H withdrawals.

I have been using kratom pretty much daily for about a year and a half, and that has helped keep my cravings at bay for the most part. today I decided I would try and chip knowing that I have an emergency stash of subs and a good amount of kratom to help keep some degree of control. 

anyhow, I very carefully took a dose earlier this evening (with the friend who helped me scored from a reliable plug) spacing out each tiny bump over 15-30 minutes increments. all told I had about 4 small bumps before I reached what I guess you could call a high, but it was mostly drowsiness and me staving off my paranoia about taking too much. I also had a dose of kratom this morning and I’m sure that also interfered with the “high” to a large degree. 

my question is, if I was going to have any sort of adverse reaction would it be apparent by now? I feel fine albeit still drowsy, but I’m scared that if I lie down and go to sleep some reactive effects might creep up. I should note that I’ve never OD’d before and want to take every precaution to avoid it (duh) even if it means not fully getting for and waiting till a day where I don’t have anything else in my system. also I’m transitioning medically right now (HRT) and on a dose of 2mg Estradiol and 100mg of Spiro, but I don’t know of any negative interactions. am I good to go to bed tonight lol? 

I just want other people’s read on this, it’s been so long and even though I’ve been super intentional and cautious, I want to make sure I’m as safe as possible (without just not doing dope in the first place). I realize this will come off as reckless to some of you and I understand why, but there are a lot of reasons for my decisions and I’m well aware it’s not the best one. I’m not saying spare me the chiding but please know I’ve considered the reality of my situation and I’m not thrilled about it.

So this is kinda opiate relates but maybe someone has experience here. 


Had a big time pill habit. Worst it got was around 150mg a day for 4 years. I stopped that by moving to Kratom for a year which obviously is similar to simply kicking the can down the road. Today I could proudly say I’m 7 months clean with no subs. Strictly lame ass sobriety. 

I still have PAWS, yanno the depression every now and then as all the physicals are gone. 

BUT I have a xanex and addy script I just got. I took about 2 mg of xans and 40 mg of addys. I feel so much better and way more productive. I’ve takin this combo in the past when I was about 3 months clean and it made all the wd’s go away. 

My question is, once I go thru this xan and addy binge, u think it’ll reactive some of my opi wd’s?? This may be an outrageous question but I’m nervous I may have mild wd’s similar to that of opiates. Anyone out there know, any help would be super dope. 

Thanks guys. Love this fuckin sub. ",1518490857.0

Those who have had their share of heroin AND fentanyl withdrawals. Was one worse than the other? 
Say you've been a steady H user but suddenly the heroin in your city went ghost So you've been copping fentanyl (or vice versa). Do the WD's feel worse? come on faster? Last longer/shorter? 

I've been doing ONLY street fentanyl (not sure which analog) for about 2 years. I never tried heroin first, fentanyl was already full swing and H was/is hard to come by around here. Lately I've been getting an H/fent mix, I love it. It's a light-medium brown color, powder/chunky, vinegar smell. 

My question is: When it comes to withdrawals, Am I better off doing this mix rather than just fentanyl. Or would it actually be worse because it's 2 substances? Or would it even make a difference? Ideally I'd like to do pure H but that won't happen.

My question is, does anyone else get very intense tremors and muscle twitching while high? And even after they're high? It's really only happened during my last two uses, but I still find it very strange. I just sobered up maybe four hours ago, and I'm still shaking like a motherfucker. In fact, it is much worse now than when I was high. At least then it would only come in phases, unlike now, as I've been jittering and twitching non-stop for the past hour or so. A part of me is considering that maybe, just maybe it's some sort of mild withdrawal, but with the casual nature of my use (I went on a week long binge about a month and a half ago, didn't experience any withdrawal. Didn't do anything again until two days ago when I took 200 mgs of codeine, and then the same dose tonight), it seems very unlikely.

Anyone got any ideas on what this could be?

I had made a thread about this situation a few months ago. basically this 18 yr old girl hayley moore at this college near me (JMU) was dating this guy, joseph fondaco. they were doing dope and the girl ODs and dies. he doesnt get charged until her family runs a campaign to just ruin this kids life and they end up managing a way to get him charged with fucking capital murder!! the girls parents accept no responsibilty that their daughter was a junkie and blame this kid instead. sickeninig

well looks like he got a plea deal reduced to manslaughter, 25 year sentence all suspended but 6 months. hed been held without bail for about 4 months now so in a couple months he will be free

this goes to all parents of addicts - yes it is sad when a young person dies due to drugs. BUT IT IS NOT FAIR TO RUIN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BECAUSE YOUR KID WAS A JUNKIE AND YOU DONT WANT TO BELIEVE IT

here is a somewaht updated link regarding the case. http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Leesburg-man-charged-in-connection-to-the-death-of-JMU-student-Hailey-Moore-445906603.html

when i posted this last time you guys helped to flood comments to both WHSV, the Daily News Record, and JMUs newspaper The Breeze. both publications had biased, unfair articles which basically blamed Fondaco. would it be possible for us as a community to once again stand up for justice and write some letters to editors, emails, or opinion pieces? it worked very well last time and i was happy r/drugs can see the truth.

I am very happy he will be out of jail soon, fuck that girl's family is all i gotta say. sucks she died, but that gives them no right to crucify this kid. i hope everyone here can sympathize with this kid",1518487386.0

Life here lately has just enjoyed throwing bullshit my way and I haven’t been able to catch a break. Haven’t been sick or anything, so that’s a good thing. Kept getting the run around on a lot of things, but what’s new. Anyways, this couple that my girl knows needed a ride to go pick up. Unless it’s worth my time I don’t fuck around with shit like that since it seems like I’m the only one around the area that still has a car and hasn’t sold it for drugs or some shit like that. Back to the couple. They said it would be worth my time and made sure it was going to be. Was still skeptical cause I’ve heard that before and it wasn’t, figured if it was something like that again, I’d just kick em out of my car. For one, it was midnight, going through smaller towns and then hitting back roads. Sketches me out cause cops are dicks and think if you’re out that late, your up to no good. Long story short, split 3 30s between 4 of us. Haven’t had anything but .5mg of a sub 28hrs before that. Got first pull and split it with my girl. Did the shot and waited....and waited and waited. Didn’t feel a damn thing. Other couple didn’t feel a damn thing either. Figured at least ONE of us would have felt a little something. Got to lookin at the other 3 pills and they were m box 30s. Wellllll, that shit was fake as fuck! Still wondering what the fuck I shot up. Obviously wasn’t something horrible cause we’re all still fine. Very first time I’ve ever come across a pressed pill, around my area. Its not common whatsoever here cause a lot of people haven’t even heard of presses and shit like that. Like I’ve said in previous posts, live around a bunch of redneck tweakers. Basically a shit post but just still in shock. The guy tasted one after we all realized it wasn’t what it was supposed to be and he said it wasn’t bitter at all. I guess it wasn’t too bad cause I got another 8mg sub strip for $10 from a buddy I went to way earlier in the day for rox 20s but ended up being phenfrazine or some shit like that. Wasn’t his fault since he doesn’t dabble in this game much but he felt bad for me coming and not getting what I was hoping to get and felt compelled to find me something. So yeah, this weekend was basically total shit except for not being sick, which I’m thankful for but cheese and rice this was some shitty bullshit. Rant over for now.

Anyway I'm planning on shooting amphetamine powder, and the process should be pretty similar to what you guys are shooting.

What gauge would you recommend for IV use? I'm also going to try IM ketamine, what gauge would you recommend for this? I have ordered 27g, 3/4"" and 23g 1"" needles.

When I previously tried to IV, it was stupid difficult because I used a 26g and I didn't want to shoot without registering, and making sure I could draw back blood. From what I've read, the reason why this was so damn difficult is because blood is usually too thick for a 26g and it was pretty much impossible to pull back the plunger.

But when I look at what people use to IV, I got the impression that most people use very high gauges, but this means you just have to be sure you hit a vein and shoot it slowly, right? 'cause with a needle that thin, its highly impractical to withdraw blood.

Should I use the 27g for IV, and after being very sure I hit a vein, push slowly and see if I feel it, and if I do, I'm good to go?

Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time. 

But before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us. 

The fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him. 

Eventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off. 

Then withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me. 

It's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol.

Bud and his running partner, aka ya boy right here, can hustle fine string instruments. Was that one of you guys though, or was Bud right and it was God? Because it worked out rather perfectly. 

By the way if you remember from last post about the guy who was supposedly dying but in such a way that it was not at all considered a medical emergency, here's the update. I totally fucked that off, didn't even see Bud until way later than initially planned. One of the things I had to take care of before going to that trap was with my homegirl, Flail-Bot 3000. She flailed and fuckin flailed and I tried so hard to work with her and ended up leaving her stranded in a rock quarry and way late to the dude who was supposedly dying. Could've lived could've died, I don't know. 

So last night Bud calls me. It was a discouraging day for the guy. If he didn't have concrete, verifiable progress to his moving out of the house by morning he was getting thrown out then and there. With for the most part just a cello to work with, and him and I being in the trade of hard drugs not string instruments, we weren't getting our hopes up. No cello sale then no reliable living, no necessary resources, no being a father to a son, no shelter until jail via racial profiling by the police, etc. Since he considered it his last night at the house and he was just alone in it, he wanted me to come over and spend it with him. I get there, we chainsmoke cigarettes while we have real talk, share stories and try to sell other smaller items for at least a little something. About 30 minutes in I have a sale for a watch I have lined up, another sale for another watch, and a trade, but then I a get *piiinggggggg* ya know, fb messenger? Some rando added me and asked, ""Hey man, how's it going? I heard you have a cello on the cheap I've been trying to get one within my budget."" 

Well fuck me sideways friend, you can bet your own toned taternuts that I sure do! I show Bud the message, he grabs my phone staring it right in the fuckin screen with his eyes lit up accommodated by a huge smile and says, ""Oh my God! Is this real?"" And I'm not fuckin around here, just then his phone gets a *piingggggg* ya know the Facebook thing, yeah. It was another rando contacting him about buying the FUCKING CELLO. Bud and I read it together and in the same tone as 3 seconds before he says, ""Oh my god! What the fuck is happening?"" 

You guys. Seriously please tell me if it was you or what, but within the next 50 minutes after the first ping, we had a total of 9 people hit us up for this cello. 3 hit me and 6 hit him, never met or heard of any of these people. From what we gathered, someone I know knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who mentioned a cheap cello at work where our buyer overheard it. We sold it to the first guy who hit me up 7 hours after he sent message, had the money in hand at 6AM this morning. 

So again. 

I'm not fucking kidding please PM or something because I've never believed in miracles and I don't want to start now. I'm going to see Bud out of state within the next 4 days, and I'm going to miss the absolute shit out of him, but I wouldn't try to chain him here or make him feel bad because he's actively pursuing what he greatly values, which is his 2 year old son. I've been in some horrible, some great, some hilarious some unmentionable positions in my time in the drug scene, but so far this has been the fiasco that I value the most.

For the record, on the way to sell this thing in the early hours of morning driving down the highway, I told him he can for real tell me the actual origins of this cello, it's about to be over so just tell me I absolutely must know. Period. Like it's a thing. All he really could say was, ""I already told you, it just kinda showed up."" I'm pretty sure there's a lesson to be learned from this little cello fiasco, like what they do at the end of South Park episodes, or King of the Hill? Is it persue your greater values even though you're pretty clearly just gonna fuck it up the more you try? I don't know. Either way I'm happy with the way it went.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I have always known that he deals with severe pain on a daily basis. He was born with a deformity in his hip that causes the joint and socket to slowly disintegrate over time. He will eventually need a hip replacement. He’s also been in two serious motorcycle accidents in the last 10 years. The most recent one was about 3 years ago, and he almost died. He had a punctured lung and shattered his kneecap along with injuring several vertebrae. He was in the hospital for about a week and out of work for several months. He was given pain medication in the hospital but when he got out he was drug tested before the doctor would refill his prescription and he failed for weed. So the doctor gave him Motrin which he never took. I know this is true because I read the paperwork, even I was like wtf. As far as I know he has no legitimate prescriptions for any opiates. 

He is the kind of guy that doesn’t like to show weakness and tries to be very masculine and macho in that sense. I know that he is in pain every day because I hear him whimpering in the morning when he thinks I’m asleep. He’s becoming more immobile and after work he just comes home and sits on the couch smoking weed until he goes to bed. He’s very stubborn and is terrified of the doctor so he just “toughs it out” and refuses to talk to me about it (which is another big but unrelated problem in our relationship). So when he exhibits the behavior I’m about to describe and I ask him wtf is up he just says he’s “fine.” 

Now I personally don’t do opiates, and I actually think I’m allergic because they make me feel really sick and weird and itchy every time I take them. However, I’ve seen people nodding off and have had friends that abuse them, so I feel like I know what it looks like. Over the past 3 or 4 months he’s been acting really fucking suspect and it seems like he’s fucked up for the following reasons:

He comes home from work and immediately goes into the bathroom for like 45 minutes. When I ask him what he’s doing he’s says he’s taking a shit and that I need to leave him alone. Ok, that sounds plausible, but still weird to me since it’s like the same exact time frame like 4 days out of the week.
 
He just passes out on the couch, like head back mouth open passed out. It doesn’t seem like regular “sleeping” and for someone that claims to only smoke weed (he never drinks) it’s seems really fucking odd to me. It gets to the point that I have to shake him and then he wakes up. Sometimes for a minute then goes right back to “sleeping” or is just awake. 

His mother is prescribed Vicodin and I know he “occasionally” takes one for his pain. He claims to only take it when it’s so bad that he can’t move. He frequently gets very defensive when questioned and says “I’m not a fucking junkie.” 

He’s a generally grumpy dude, but sometimes he just seems really high and way happier than usual. I’ve been chalking that up to the fact that he’s a pothead but my gut is telling me something else is happening. 

He’s also constantly broke despite working a full time job. It’s not a great job, it’s in a kitchen, but still. You should have some money and I don’t think weed and your car insurance costs your entire paycheck. 

His general demeanor lately has been really uncharacteristic. Like extremely angry and just not giving a fuck about me or anything really. This past weekend was my birthday and he passed out on the couch at like 8pm with his head back and his mouth open. I kept checking his breathing and waking him up because it scared me. I told him all of this and how I think he was on something and he laughed and said he was “tired.” Wtf.

I’m not a fucking idiot and I kind of think I already know this is what’s happening, but I would like some outside validation. Like I said, I don’t do opiates and idk if some people just sleep like that or if it’s indicative of being on something. I just want to say that I’m not judging anyone that does this, but I’m scared for him and I need to know if this is what I’m dealing with. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply. 

TLDR

Boyfriend passes out all the time, acts weird, has chronic pain issues and I think he’s abusing opiates but I don’t know for sure. ",1518467824.0

However, whenever I try to cold cop or cop from people I vaguely know, they usually ask for sex in exchange from product, which I just could not do and absolutely would not do, even in prime, severe withdrawal.

So yesterday was my birthday and I was calling texting around trying to find some 30s i already had some but wanted more. Anyways I called 2 of my main dealers but they were out for the month. So I text this one guy I use to deal with couple months back always did me right and when I sold to him I always did him right. Well I text him and see if he still had the 15s he texted me about Friday I was gonna grab them from him 4 for 50. He replied back and was like  ""I can get some 30s how many do you want?"" I replied and told him 3. Well we decided to meet up at a store that really busy all hours of the day right down the road from my house. 5 or 10 minutes pass and I'm waiting for my buddy i don't see him but I see this black guy walking down the road from my buddy's house (mind you my buddy is white I'm talking about). So this black guy goes in the store and is in there mayne 5 minutes then he starts walking to my car knock on the window and Is like ""you tyler?"" I was like ""yeah"" he said ""trey wanted me to bring you these he didn't want alot of traffic at his house"". So I'm looking at these and I can barely see a imprint it almost looked like they hit some water. He was telling me they were the real deal and shit but I was like nah bro I'm good but I'll give you a ride back up the hill to his house. So I head back home then my so call buddy trey text me and Is like ""hey I got some other ones you can read they are the E8s"" he sent a pic and everything they were the real E8s. I guess he thought he was gonna give them fucked up ones to me but I didn't want them cause I felt sketched about them.  Anyways after about 10 or 15 minutes I went up to his house actually which was a bad idea I should of told him to meet me at the gas station again. So this black guy comes back out gets in the car and the first thing I see in his hand is a baggie of the E8s my eyes are focused on them and not even him. All the sudden this black guy says ""just give me the money"" I said ""what do you mean?"" He then pulls out a glock shows me that there is a round in the chamber. Sooo at the point I was trying to stay calm, I also had my Ruger SR9 on my side and my CCW he could not see that at all. So I say ""you gonna shoot me if I don't give you this money?"" He said ""nah I ain't gonna do anything if you just give me the money."" So now I'm like fuck it I don't know this guy, I don't wanna get shot let me give this little $90 so he can get the hell out my car. I wanted to just get out the car turn around draw my gun and shoot his ass through the window but that would of looked like a drug deal gone bad or some shit plus the gun was still on me. So when I did hand him the money he was like nah that ain't all you got.. So I gave this other 10.00 in my pocket I also dropped my phone between the seat so he wouldn't try and get that and i left my wallet at home since I was just gonna be 5 minutes. So after he got that 10 he got out and started waking back into the house. I thought at that moment should I pull gun out and at least try and wound him in the leg while he isn't looking? I didn't want shoot him In the back as much as I wanted to I know that was a big no no. So honestly I just let it walk cause either way if I shot him and the police came wondering why I shot him I had no legitimate reason why i did other then he pulled a gun on me.. there's a always a reason. I also thought if I did shoot him and the police came I was gonna tell them I was meeting him to buy something off the App letgo, I had no messaging proof for that though.  I honestly don't know if i did the right thing or not. I wasn't gonna call the law after that situation.. Idk i was calm during the situation kind of but my mind was blank that's the first time anything like that has ever happened to me. My life is more valuable then a $100 cause I didn't know that guy I didn't know if he was gonna shoot me or not.. So idk if I did the right thing or the wrong thing.

I know there's people here who don't think lope has a withdrawal but it does.. and it's bad.  I dosed high one day when I was going thru another drug withdrawal and found that I felt pretty good, which was surprising.

Ever since then the doses ramped up pretty quickly. The sad part is I read the stories about people dying and all the heart problems and started doing this AFTER.

Think I was going ok for awhile and then I kept experiencing severe weakness and shortness of breath that lasted months, still not enough to stop me. My family thinks I'm sober, and I have put on a good impression for awhile but I'm broken.

Not broken enough of course to stop taking it, but broken enough to where I'm starting to avoid responsibilities more and more, so I know it's a matter of time before it gets bad. 

At least with my other addictions I eventually could come out about it after feeling defeated, but how the fuck can you tell anyone ""Yeah I'm addicted to this anti diarrhea drug and have been for the past year"".

But, opiates have completely ruined my life and i cant keep using! 

Ive tried all the typical things to help slow down my use.... but ive got zero control. Ive asked my wife to hide it, but i always go looking and easily find it.

I honestly dont know what to do. If i do t use, i cant work and spend most of the day in bed because of the pain. But, if i do use, i spend every single pennie we have on it. I have a good job, but every month its a race to pay all the bills before the disconnection dates. 

Sorry for the lomg post...im just rambling 

Edit* i forgot to mention that i own my own company and dont have insurance because every penny goes towards H. Besides, finding a doctor to prescribe me enough to help is nearly impossible. The few times i do find that doctor, my addict mind always does something to screw it up. Ill either act like an addict at some point and get shut off, or fail a drug test because i used H.",1518446678.0

I decided to take a 3 month break once I was feeling like reducing my tolerance a little. Prior to that I had been dosing like once a week for a month or two.

Now my hangovers have gotten terrible. I’m doing doses half of what I used to do, but I feel high throughout the next day. I wake up feeling nauseated and with a body high that lasts up to the entire day. Constipation isn’t all that bad because I usually make sure to eat fiber so I can shit comfortably.

Why is this? I never got hangovers like that before. Not even when I did bigger doses, and not even when I was more naïve.

Could it be something to do with the filler in the pills, changing from brand to brand? Is my tolerance just too low?",1518441308.0
