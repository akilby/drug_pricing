I remember watching this girl named Megan on Intervention who started the episode being released from jail - she scores heroin within 48 hours of her release. She says, “when you’re an addict there’s always a little voice in the back of your head telling you it’ll be fine to use when you get really low, and if you’re low enough, you start to believe it.” She’s right.

I’m just wondering if that little voice will ever go away. Being clean is so bittersweet.",1510327741.0

My kidneys still hurt but I feel much less pain and I am totally high again and now my life has a meaning again. I know that it is stupid to do dope again after I have gone through the wds but out of some restless feeling in my whole body and nearly only sleeping about 2-5 hours a night it is really stupid to start again but my life felt so horrible and empty without dope. But now I am feeling so great again as mentioned before. I am so thankfull that so many guys of you helped me and texted me such nice messages. But I am not ready to quit I am still in love with H. So guys stay as you are cause you are such lovely ppl and everyone of you who want to be really clean just do it. I thought too that I want to be clean in the last months but now I know that I am still not ready for it. Maybe because I can still handle my shit or maybe cause I am a stupid piece of shit. I wish all of you all the best. Stay safe fam. And happy nods bropiates. Love you guys. ,1510327302.0

Of course I relapsed. Went broke again. But this time was different. 

I made the jump.

Pills to H. Idk how I got here. I hate myself and this shit. I know of so many ways to stop, and why I should & how grossed out at myself I am. I'd do anything to know what the fuck those little blue pills actually were & what they did. I swear.  Everyday something shitty happens and I some how tell myself this is all OK to do. Numb the pain. It's alllllll good. 

 Now EVERYONES prices went up. $30 a fucking pill. I need 60 mg just to really feel something. Broke as fuck. Two weeks ago I found another plug for H. (My last one was a dick.. even if he was right. See my last post if you give a shit) But ""lucky"" me, it's still too far away to even want to grab it daily. I swear On that side of this shit hole area I always get shorted.

 I don't even remember why or how but two weeks ago some how I convinced my pill dude to introduce me to someone who sells H. Always on the block, the block only 15 mins from my work. Always on deck, always when I need it. Just the fourth time I bought he gave me extra (they never do that here). I wish being a ""beautiful"" girl they only know as baby (lol) didn't help so much but fuck yeah it does. Anyways, here we are. 

There's only BTH here. I can only bring myself to smoke it. I tried snorting it and I think I'm just doing it wrong. I can't bring myself to shoot it. like taking it any different way makes it any better. Ha

The only person who knew died almost a year ago so that didn't help. I swear we were both finally doing it. Now I'm alone. Anyone who kinda knew thinks I stopped. Which I did but only for 6 months at the longest. Whata joke. No one knows. Idk why I'm even posting this. I always leave you guys when I'm trying to be ""sober"" because it's so goddamn tempting. And I'm always right back here, usually worse than before.

 I know most of you probably don't give a fuck, have been there, here & back & probably stopped reading. it's always the same story. But it really fucking isn't. I know I'm not the only one who wonders how the fuck they got here. I know I don't want this to be... it. I don't want to die, or OD, or both. Especially have my family & friends find me that way. that would fucking end them. 

I know I'm capable of stopping. or at least getting on subs. I know I have support. I know I'll (fucking hopefully) never be homeless. I know I'm just being a big cry baby who can't get over losing my best friend & a boyfriend, especially to the same thing that is ruining me. People lose people everyday. What the fuck is wrong with me, my brain won't let me move on. It's killing me. 

I tell myself everyday I'd do ANYTHING if I could just wake up tomorrow and stop. Then there I am either with a pill broken down or a fucking piece of tinfoil. I thought I hit rock bottom before... lmao. I wish I knew what my purpose here on this dumb ass planet was. even just a sign that to tell me that I actually even have one. I don't know how much longer I can do it. Whatever the fuck that means. 

I don't even know why I wrote this. I only know why I did it here - because this is the only ""safe"" place I have to talk about this legit second life I have. The only place where hopefully someone else gets it. Most of you probably don't even remember me since I always come and go, but very many of you have helped me in a lot of ways. I wish I could thank those people. At least I can thank whoever tf might be crazy enough to read this post of me basically whining. Thank you. Hopefully someday I'll be able to post about doing the exact opposite.

Someday... Hopefully.  ",1510325554.0

Because of the Pregabalin, and not having eaten almost nothing during the day, I was extremely hungry, so I ate a BIG dinner based on home made French Fries and ""Milanese"" (aye, I am from Argentina). All was well with the world and eventually I went to bed. I tried to read a book but I kept almost loosing consciousness, so I decided to sleep.
I don't remember sleeping so fast and so well in months. I didn't get up during the night at all. My breathing was calm and everything felt all right.
Now, when I woke up, at 6.30am, I was almost dizzy of pleasure, I could feel it in all my body, it was too extreme too get out of bed, and also, it was so early, that I decided to sleep a little bit more.
I got up at 8.30am, still feeling a lot of pleasure, but thinking about the coming day, I still had more Tramadol for one or two more ""sessions"", Pregabalin, and some Lorazepam.

Point is, normally Tramadol gets bashed as an horrible drug -and might be it in some cases, I mean, an opioid that has to be metabolized to become powerful and it is at the same time a strong-instant SSRI? well, for some cases, it is awesome. It is better than other opioids or opiates that lasts a few hours, and it is definitely better than the ones that hits you so hard that all you do is nod (yes, I have tried ""real"" opioids in the past).
The key is having a very low tolerance, and not taking antidepressants. Then Tramadol+Pregabalin and some benzo throw there is heaven.

Well, today he saw me looking over at him so he strolled over to chat. Asked me what I was in for and so I obvi told him opi’s. So this slick motherfucker pulls out a fat shaving kit packed full of 0.1 bags of dope. He is selling them to “recovering” addicts in rehab for $60 A FUCKING POINT. I politely decline and he then offers them to me for half price. Again I decline.

What is your opinion on the scenario? I’m not asking for advice. Just wondering what you think. Plz don’t waste time telling me to sell him out. I’m not gonna be a snitch.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

(Who was my girlfriend at the time)  carried me to her car .she drove me to the end of my grandparents street and made a decision.  Too either kick me out of her car turn around and run. Or just turn around and take me to the hospital.  She ended up punching me in the face and drug me back into the car, spun around and did 100 the whole way to the hospital. I ended up needing three doses of narcan  to be brought back around. The first thing i remember is waking up to her crying on my chest with me having no recollection of what had just happened.  Fast forward to today I am almost two years clean. I have a wonderfully beautiful intelligent sixteen month daughter i have a great job as a chef in a very well respected kitchen. But me and the Ex became strained through everything I put her through as an addict and wound up resenting me . To the point of physical and emotional abuse. And we now share custody of our daughter and she moved back home with her family in PA. Given everything.  I love her for saving my life and helping me become the person and father i am today  but i hate her for everything else . Even though she is not around to see it . End rant.    ",1510283105.0

Well I lapsed after 8 days and used a few evenings until 50+ hours ago and I haven't used since but I'm struggling way harder this time and idk why. Last time it wasn't so bad bar some emotional difficulty, but that was it really. 

My anxiety has been dissociative since the start of the year and whadda ya know yesterday I start getting major Depersonalization/Derealization. Now the really annoying bit is this started after I woke up from an evening nap (which can be a bit disorienting) and physically I'm not horrible; my stool is alright, apetite isn't great but no nausea or vomiting, slept well last night. So either a) this is withdrawal anxiety manifesting via DPDR/feeling ** Really ** out of it or b) it's psychosomatic and I'm associating this experience negatively (which is why I feel so out of proportion to last week's attempt). Last night I was so anxious I had to sit down and accept the possibility of getting acutely anxious again and having to come out to my mum about my use..(which would not be fun at all, moreso for her), I did proceed to calm down following accepting this uncertainty but I'm overall struggling and feeling very disconnected (On TOP of all the guilt, regret and blah blah), arr this is shite and I don't even know if it's directly WD or not. The thought that a bit of H or Codeine would have me chill the fuck right down is a bit appealing but overall I'm just caught up in feeling extremely disconnected and mum has indeed noticed (though all that I'm exhibiting has resulted from my anxiety alone at times so she's not that shocked by it).",1510282531.0

7by57k,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7by57k/sub_taper_with_dope_interspersed_an_oxymoron_of/,2,https://redd.it/7by57k,horrorfannj,"Sub taper with dope interspersed- an oxymoron of sorts, yes, but I have a question.","So I've been taking sub since Saturday to try and taper, but of course things have been going well and my boy keeps throwing me buns and as an addict its hard to resist. But, I'm at the point where I'm just done, so I'm going to continue tapering and not using dope anymore.

But anyway:

I have been taking 1mg sub every morning since Sunday. So, Sunday I took 1mg sub and didn't use. The next day, I took 1.5mg sub or so in the morning, and I ended up getting some dope later on that day. It was good quality, I felt pretty high, and all was well. The next day, I really didn't feel sick even almost at 24 hours. Usually I would feel sick around 18 hours, sometimes less. But, I did not, and I took my sub in the morning after almost 24 hours, because I wanted to continue to taper. I ended up getting another bun, but it was shit quality, so I didn't feel anything. Whatever. 

Then yesterday, I took about .5 mg sub, but I wasn't even feeling sick at all, and I had just about hit 24 hours again. I used again, a bun of good quality dope, felt high, and that was that.

We come to today, and I was not even feeling a slight hint of withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours. I mean... no hints of achiness, no yawning, no watery eyes, no restlessness, no anxiety, not even intense cravings. I actually was in a GREAT mood, when usually I'm fiending hard as fuck when it's been 16-18 hours since I last used. And I took a very small piece of sub yesterday, and the dope I did was good, but if I had just done the dope, I would have been sick after like I said... 18 hours or so. The exact amount of hours is irrelevant I suppose; it's just that by a whole day later I KNOW I would be sick.

So, I didn't bother taking any sub today, because I knew I had to stop using dope in order to really commit to being clean. So I did what any good junkie would, and I did my last bundle today. I know everyone has said ""this is my last one"" plenty of times when it wasn't, but I finally have made the decision that I really want to stop. It's just not worth it anymore; getting high for a few hours, and then all you can think about is copping again tomorrow and how you're going to get the money for it. The high isn't fun anymore and I'm sick of hurting the people I love by using. It's just fucked. I want to save my relationship because my girl is basically on her last nerve with me, because I keep using. I can't do it anymore.

Anyway, emotional nonsense aside, I am wondering if using the dope after taking the sub and in between my doses has affected my sub taper at all. I am planning on taking 1 mg each morning for the next few days, and then .5 mg, and then just jumping off. 

Judging by how long I've been able to go before I felt sick, I feel like the sub stayed in my system, and I was able to ""cheat"" this system and get high, while still reaping the benefits of the long-lasting sub.

So, did I really set myself back with using the dope at all? Or did the sub remain in my system, and its just like I've been tapering and was lucky to get high? I really don't need a lot of sub to stay well. At this point, all I need is .5-1mg... I feel the hardest part with sub is the first day of induction, switching from dope to subs. Hitting the sweet spot is tough. But I always try and use a low amount so as to make the taper easy as possible.

Hope this wasn't too convoluted.

I really want to do this, guys. I've spent way too much time wasted on dope. It just isn't worth it anymore. I hope all of you can recover too once you're ready. Thanks for everything.",1510279594.0

Problem being the only vein I could hit was being super finnickey and I kept losing it and had to dig around a couple times so I wasn't able to shoot it as quickly as usual. I still got a good rush and a great fucking high, but just not what I'm used to when doing that much. I prefer to shoot it quick and feel it all at once and be on my ass for a few minutes. 

Anyway I still have some left and might grab another 40 bag for the rest of the night because of how early it is (8:20pm)  So I'm wondering how long I should wait between shots to feel the full effect each time (or at least close to it). Usually I don't wait long between shots and it feels like I waste most of it except the first shot which is why I always make it so big.

My favorite strain is red Bali. Also due to Kratom being hydrophobic it's hard to mix it into a liquid to drink. I recommend getting an empty water bottle and putting a small amount of either chocolate milk or eggnog in the bottle, about a gulps worth. Take a small piece of paper and fold it in half length wise creating a sort of troff. Spoon your Kratom into the troff and put one end to the top of the bottle. Tilt up the troff and lightly tap the bottom of it to help the Kratom slide into the bottle. Screw on the cap and shake like a mad man. This works much better then trying to stir in the Kratom with a spoon.

I live in an area know for drug problems and I walk my dog every single day.  I watch him like a hawk normally, but especially now.

If you choose to use opiates there is a high risk, especially now, of it containing fentanyl.  Fentanyl sticks to whatever it touches and that packaging becomes lethal to any person or animal that touches it.  

I have no issues if you choose to do opiates, but please dispose of your packaging into an appropriate receptacle.  Don't risk other people or animals lives because you are too lazy to throw your shit in a trash can.  

This sub is for harm reduction and spreading this info can definitely help reduce harm to innocent people and animals.  Please, I am begging all of you to spread this info to your fellow bropiates and dealers.


Edit-moral of the story is. . . And is clearly stated. 

Using opiates responsibly=fine
Being a littering POS=not fine.

A few of y'all completely missed that this is about reducing harm of others who are innocents in regards to the drug world.  If you don't ever litter than we are cool.  I think the ones that got upset by this post are possibly just mad because they are litterbugs.  I blast littering on every sub when it comes up.  

Drug use alone is not selfish and if you choose to live that way please keep yourself and others safe. . . It isn't that hard, man.",1510244407.0

For once they were sad, angry or defeated, but now they are empty, dark and muted. I once was an iridescent prism, reflecting every shade of light, once I believed in the fairness of the world and the goodness in my life. 

Still, I know my experiences are mostly good, but good doesn't feel the same anymore. If my skin tans it somehow feels just like a burn, then fades back to pale quickly, as if I never stepped outside. The rain clouds feed the grass, and it is green indeed, but the definition of green has changed to me- no longer fresh new possibility, rather bitter, dissonant melancholy that leaves a dark taste in my mouth akin to Indonesian coffee. What's really changed isn't the world I guess, what's really changed is me. 

I'm duller now, and sadder, heavier and hopeless. I smile like a fairy princess but it's all just a farce, I learned to play that character from A Midsummer Night’s Dream. In my mind's eye I see my younger self turn the pages quietly, so enthralled by the fantasy flavored story, convinced that the magic in the play existed in real life, just in a different way. What I've learned since growing up is that life is a tragedy, not a comedy, and the light that streaks in through the cracks in the stone prison roof (that we call a great blue sky) are only momentary distractions from the mundane and the unbearable.

Cut to tonight where we finally scored a ball after some unrelated hookup drama, and I'm cooking down my shot and smelling some shit I don't normally smell when cooking up. It smelled like dope, but it also kinda smelled like cat piss or something, which I actually attributed to the new cat that moved in, but when I smelled the cook and the D itself, it sure enough smelled like dope and... Cat piss i guess? I dunno, it smelled like something pungent that definitely wasn't my regular dope smell, but it definitely got me high so I don't know what the fuck is up. The consistency of the dope is a little off too. It's kind of crumbly and brittle in a way that the tar I've been getting doesn't really do. It cooked up a little weird too.

**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

We went over the ordered then he told me where to go and pulls up acting retarded about why it's only 11.5 not 12.5. I ask him about the free g, which we had just talked about 5 mins before, and he starts literally screaming from the front if the car to the back that I'm being greedy and ""stop being so greedy yo"".

Edit  [I was too cold to type the whole story, and above is the gist, but he was also screaming at me very loudly and trying to intimidate me. At this point I don't give a fuck and just want to leave, saying ""okay, fine, whatever"" and he was across the center console pretty much with his whole body over and in the back seat.

Alternatively, if I don't abuse it then I'm setting myself up for success.

OR perhaps it'd be better to have that final high and get it out of my system so I'm not thinking about it during the butrans patch period of time.

I watch a lot of documentaries about opiates, and I came across this one about the crisis in Canada. I have heard about safe injection sites in Canada before, but this was the first I learned of a really unique (and somewhat controversial) government-funded recovery program for long-time addicts. Basically, addicts in this program are provided with free, medical grade heroin. They are given restricted amounts and can use it safely at the clinic in which they receive it. This program reduces government costs, the amount of overdoses (mainly because addicts aren’t consuming heroin cut with fentanyl), as well as thefts and other petty crimes committed by people looking to fund their habits. It actually seems very innovative and successful. The program is only open to long, LONG-term addicts that have tried other means of getting sober. Basically, the idea is that these people are going to use heroin anyway, so instead of them obtaining/using it illegally and dangerously, why not regulate it and have them use it in a safer, more cost-effective way?

This is the first time I’ve ever heard about this. I think it’s a really great idea. This documentary was interesting as a whole, but this specific program is discussed at 35:25. Documentary goes into detail about the fentanyl crisis in Canada, and it was pretty eye-opening. Definitely worth checking out. ",1510348793.0

Long time lurker here. I've been browsing this sub on & off for a while - when I'm all out or just don't have as much drugs as I'd like to, I tend to torture myself by reading this board and looking at your beautiful stashes, and if I have enough heroin to get me to where I like to be I tend to be busy chain smoking, nodding out and/or smoking crack to go on Reddit, but I've always appreciated this sub - it's a nice counterbalance to /r/opiatesrecovery & seems to be the only sub where heroin isn't demonized, even amongst the other drug subs. 

I've been on & off & on & off heroin for four, nearly five years now. I smoked it for a little while but then graduated to I.V. use after a couple of months, and then in the last year I've been alternating between just heroin & mixing it with crack - either I.V. as a speedball or just hitting the pipe. As I'm sure many of you can relate to, I've been tantalized by the prospect of chipping but have failed at keeping my use at that level countless times. 

However, about four months ago I met a girl who changed my perspective entirely. I met her while she was using - she was taking heroin + crack, though not I.V. - and she told me that she used to be a junkie but now just chipped. Of course, I immediately assumed she was either lying to me or herself or both, as I've heard that many times but invariably they are either on a fast downward spiral on the way to being a full blown junkie, at the start of a relapse or just flat out lying, so I naturally assumed the same of her. 

However, afterwards I bought it up with a friend who confirmed that he's known her for over a year and she doesn't have a habit. I was still dubious, but have been seeing a lot of her, and in the four months I've known her I've met her many times, but she has only been high on five occasions. I haven't even had a tiny suspicion - it's obvious when she's high, she does it openly, & I've seen & experienced enough withdrawal to know what it looks like. She is a genuine chipper, and has been for *three years*! I was absolutely fascinated, and have spent the last couple of months picking her brain.

She explained to me the same old story that we all know, of starting out with the usual arrogant assumption that we will be the special one that doesn't get hooked and maintaining this delusion until heroin has kicked our ass, ruined our relationships, drained our bank accounts, lost us our jobs & totally derailed everything we held dear. She explained that she quit entirely for a few months, and then she decided that heroin was very valuable to her - the state of mind that it gives her (as it gives most of us) was so extremely pleasurable that she didn't want to let it go. She was determined to conquer it. She said she spent a few months trying & failing and slipped up many times, but then something clicked for her. She realized a large part of her failure to manage it stemmed from the deeply held yet partially subconscious core belief that each time she used she was destined to become hooked again. She realized that each time she lapsed she surrendered entirely to addiction again, and that she needed to stop lying to herself. She told me how she realized that the human spirit is incredible, & that the things that humans can achieve with determination & willpower are amazing, and that there is no reason why someone shouldn't be able to manage heroin, and no reason why it couldn't be her. 

Since that realization, she changed tactics. She internalized the fact that every time she used, for a while afterwards she would literally become mentally ill. Her mind would start lying to her, and she needed to treat herself after using as if she was psychotic, and not indulge in the thoughts that would try and drive her back to using. Since then, she only uses once a month at most, and she has never developed a habit again. 

During this time period, I weaned myself off subutex, had a relapse on heroin + crack, and then went through the withdrawal and emerged entirely physically sober. I then spent a couple of months entirely sober except for occasional drinking, but have now decided to try my hand at what she has accomplished, but this time trying to apply what she has taught me. So far, it has been successful. It's all in my mind. After using, I literally become mentally ill. For a couple of days afterwards, I know that my mind will start playing tricks on me. There is no use arguing with the thoughts that come, just as there's no use trying to argue with a paranoid schizophrenic. There's no point trying to reason with it or deny that it's happening - merely accept it, see it for the temporary mental illness that it is, and wait to emerge from the other side. Yes, those couple of days are not the most pleasant days I've ever had - it takes willpower, discipline & vigilance to continually reframe what your own plagued mind keeps telling you, but it's getting easier, and it sure beats the fuck out of withdrawals, full-blown addiction & abstinence for the rest of my life. 

The connection between using once and then using every single day needs to be extinguished. The longer you successfully chip, providing you *never* break or change the limit you set yourself, the stronger that connection will get and the easier it is to do.

Not because I want to stay clean but because I can’t find any. I have only one connect and he’s coming up empty every day. I was on a pretty low daily intake of around 20-30mg/day so I’m not feeling any significant physical discomfort from withdrawals but I am taking 3-6 2mg loperamide every 24 hours. 

This run with pills lasted about 9 months before which I had not taken any oxy/hydro for 4 years. I had been addicted to some type of opioid from 1998-2012. Started off with hydros after a rotator cuff injury which led to methadone maintenance from 2000-2008 then suboxone from 2008-2012. Switching from ‘done to subs was horrific. Getting off the subs was extremely painful physically and mentally so the memories of that experience fueled my abstinence from 2012 to early 2017. 

Alcohol became my substitute and I started to drink moderately to heavily during that period but eventually got bored with it so I decided I would try and dance with my old nemesis again. It only took a couple of months of having a relatively steady supply of cash and pills before I realized I was in trouble and in the early throes of physical/psychological dependency. Mornings are my trigger time as I absolutely love my dose first thing in the morning. I can get through the rest of the day rather easily and once that wears off I get busy with work, family responsibilities, etc. Not having that morning fix puts me in a rather melancholy way for the rest of the day.

This current dry spell probably came at a good time as I was at the precipice of spiraling into full-blown danger mode. I think the writing is on the wall for oxy/hydro aficionados/addicts though as the dry periods get longer and longer, the overall reaction to the “opiate epidemic” causing street markets here to dry up or be overpriced into the realm of insanity.

I live in the midwestern US near a large city and used to have a pretty wide range of contacts but after years of stability with legal maintenance drugs and then a few years of abstinence I just don’t know anyone anymore. DNMs look promising but also seem like a huge PITA and rife with peril. Kratom is not legal in my state and not very appealing to me though I’ve never tried it. Never going to try H. Briefly considered going back on the ‘done or subs but then I’d be officially fucked again (driving time, gas money, waiting in line, et al not to mention likely outed to my spouse hence another problem I don’t need and a situation she doesn’t deserve). Thought about shopping for a sympathetic doctor since I have decent insurance but those are roulettes odds these days. Hopefully my connect comes through with something today but if not I’ll be just okay.   

tl;dr - I passionately love oxy/hydro but she is a cruel mistress; I can endure long periods without her but can’t fathom never seeing her beautiful face again.",1510333295.0

I’ve just moved from weak ass **#3 afghan heroin in England** back to fentanyl, and when you know what you’re using and therefore dosing snd using it accurately and responsibly; i personally think it’s a really enjoyable and obviously  potent drug that delivers every time.

Ppl say it has no euphoria which i also disagree with, i feel great on it. The only downside i guess is that it definitely does have a shorter half life and generally doesn’t last as long as other opiates, like standard IV heroin..

My questions are: **Why does it have such a strong NOD to it?**

Is that just because of its potency? It feels different — it’s so strong that it’s almost like a benzo blackout, 40 mins go by and i don’t know where i’ve been... i don’t remember what happened, i lose chunks of memory... is if sleep or what? i swear i’m not around ppl so i don’t know what the fuck happens.
**i know this just reads like a typical opiates nod, but to me it feels diffeent to a classic opiate nod.. It feels much stronger**.

Does anybody know how synthetic opioids like fentanyl are synthesised to be so so strong? 
Ive read that some forms are **500-1000x more potent than Morphine**...

how is this done? What part of the synthesis makes it so potent?

I know there are many diff analogues of the Poppy plant that are very potent... but why don’t scientists just synthesise drug after drug after drug and make them really potent.. wouldn’t this just put Pills like vicodin and oxycodone out of business?

So J, R and myself set out on a trip to the city at around 11 o clock last night. We pick up from the regular dboy at the 7/11. We get beans/buttons here in the Midwest and just like everywhere else it seems to be fent is becoming the standard when it comes to the dope game here.

Dboy immediately says “be careful with these homie, they fire af and custies say they’re the best in the city right now” we hear his shit all the time so who knows but of course everyone’s like oh hell yeah some fuego finally, been dealing with shitty product lately. Lol

J is the DD to get home so he just sniffs half of one to get well and we head home. Me and R both bust one up each sniff those are nodding uncontrollably shortly after. We’re both fine though. We get back to Rs place and J immediately goes to the bathroom. He bangs the shit and neither R nor myself fucks with needles. We’re bumping some tunes just talking and bullshitting and here a thud from the bathroom.. I’m sure you can see we’re this going.. we go investigate to find J, pants around his ankles unconscious on the floor. Immediately R starts freaking out assuming worst case scenario that he’s now got a dead body in his apartment and not just that but this is one of our boys from way back. I propped J up and start trying to talk to him and see if he’ll come back to us. I get a wet was cloth and put it over his head/neck trying to do anything to get him to come too. I put my hand over his neck to feeling for a pulse and he’s breathing now! It’s slow and loud almost like snoring but breathing nonetheless. His breaths are slow and intermittent which alarms me but at least I know he’s breathing. It was at this point I had no fucking clue what to do next? I was just lost. Do I just sit here and watch dude for the next couple hours and make sure he’s good, he’s still unconscious but alive and breathing. R decides that J needs to go home now. We have to carry 200lbs of dead weight down a flight of stairs and put him into Rs car. We take him back to his house and explain to his ol lady what happened and she’s immediately pissed but I wasn’t going to lie about anything just in case considering the situation and someone’s life potentially being on the line. I end up staying over at Js just to make sure he’s okay. He woke up this morning with no recollection of the previous evening events other than him driving us back to Rs and banging 2! of the damn beans even after seeing how fucked up we were after snorting just one. I’m still annoyed with J but glad he’s alive. It was a very stressful evening to say the least. 

So I was wondering if you guys could help me out with tips on how to better handle a situation like that if it happens again, and with all the fent bullshit around I assume it won’t be the last time something like that happens. Also, no one had any Narcan and I’m not sure where I could get some even if I had the extra funds to do so. Thanks for reading guys.

It was like having gone through this process so many times had caused It to lose any of the freeing feeling it used to give me because I just know my life will come crashing down so soon afterword. 
I was kinda bitter cuz for everything that relapse caused I feel like I didn't get what I wanted out of it.

Heroin used to be a fair exchange- I give it my life and it gives me fleeting joy. Now it feels like it's a one-sided affair.

Its pretty long but I'm not going to include a TLDR because I feel the need to emphasise the importance of looking at the bigger picture in life rather than being stuck in the same thought process every day. For me, thinking like this has had a brilliant effect on my recovery.

In my recovery I have always found it difficult to find something to fill the time I used to use to get high. Since starting my Subutex program I have managed to find something I'm interested in (astronomy) and it has made me think about the bigger picture in life.

I'd just like to give an example of the power big picture thinking:

Every morning I walk along the same street on my way to work. I go to cross the road and look both ways before crossing the zebra crossing. As I look right I am always semi-blinded by sunlight (if the Sun's out) reflecting off of a window on a house somewhere up the road but this morning I had a sudden thought...

Light is made up of billions of photons, little tiny packets of energy that were created in the core of the Sun when two Hydrogen atoms fused together through EXTREME pressure to form a Helium atom. Those little packets of energy flew out then bounced around the inside of the Sun for tens of millions of years before they finally got flung out at 186000mph; transversing roughly 93 million miles to the Earth in about 8mins 20sec.

They then hit the atmosphere, got scattred downward towards the ground where they bounced off of that window and into these two fluid-filled sacs in my face that evolved photo-receptors billions
of years ago.

The only reason I was in that possition was because chemical-electrical triggers caused my brain and muscles to co-ordinate themselves into forward directional motion, leading to other muscles to move in the direction of that light - also evolved over millions of years. Those billions of photons then entered my eye and were absorbed by the same photo-receptors and turned into processable information by my brain thus - using chemical-mechanical triggers - causing me to feel pain and temporary vision imparement.

My point is that these amazing processes are totally un-thought of during every day life, the point is to occaisionally think about these things. Bigger picture thinking makes life a whole lot more interesting!",1510493332.0

Firstly; I freaked out 2 weeks ago and turned into an emotional wreck after doing some (frankly average) Heroin for the first time, really started wanting to stop using opioids, relapsed after 6 days and snorted up to .5 a night for 5 days till last tuesday. Again, wanted to stop, think I actually started to experience some minor withdrawal (relatively recent habit). Add on my dissociative anxiety/all the lies I had been telling my mum (whom knew something was up), this time **really** started getting anxious, massive dissociation, ended up telling la madre about my use and things have been improving in the few days since.

**Back to today**; finish work, 2 pints in me, 4/5 days since last use, in the city with money and open pharmacies. A 600mg codeine CWE couldnt hurt right?!


 *Only discovered opioids 4 months ago!*

*Only a couple stints of daily use!*

*Shouldnt put me back to day 1 right?!*

*Surely...*

I spent a good hour loitering around the city, smoking ciggies and pondering whether or not I should do it. **I had it all planned out as usual; pharmacy for codeine, supermarket for coffee filters and Id be in business**.

Then I thought of mum. And the potential worry that would ensue in me. The potential WD. And the simple question; **Would I rather wake up tomorrow having gotten high (filled with worry and regret) or not, either way I'll be sober as a pancake.**

I walked into that pharmacy, bought the benadryl that I needed while literally staring down those cheap asf codeine packs, walked out and now on my way home on the bus.

So I️ go pick some up get a nice gram and go home, load up probably .15 knowing that this was some fire my usually shot is around .2-.25 anyways.   So I️ register and boom, expecting this super super rush absolutely nothing and honestly I’m still feeling kinda sick.  So of course load up another bigger one probably .3.   Still nothing.  I️ think fuck it throw the rest in the spoon and finally I️ at least get well, eat a little bit and I️ decide I️ guess I’m kinda high,  lay around and eventually fall asleep.    


 Wake up this morning at like 5 am fell asleep at 12.  Sick as a dog.  Like the sickest I’ve been in a long time couldn’t compete a sentence with out sneezing.  Barley made it to the bathroom to shit.  Eventually get a hold of my one dude in the morning to see if he has any left over because he usually bought in bulk and made it last him the week.  But he said he quit and that he went to a 2 week rehab center.   I️ hadn’t heard from him in a while and didn’t know he went.   But he went to the same plug that I️ was going to(that was out for 4 days).  This plug always swore up and down that his was the purest and was raw h, and we all believed him because somehow this stuff was magic, I️ could do a small amount once a day and be high for a long long time, sometimes not even sick for the better part of 48 hours if I️ didn’t have any so I️t had legs for days.   So we get to talking for a little bit he said he doesn’t have anything but he can get me a sub.   But he was telling me thst when he went to the rehab center they took tox screens and what not and that the only thing that came up was fent.    He was telling me that before he went to rehab no other dope would work for him besides the one plug.   No matter how much he would do.   Now I️ was sitting here thinking to myself, fuck I’m addicted to fent and I didn’t even know It.   Stuff kinda starts to make more sense,  I️ grabbed a gram the other morning before I️ grabbed the raw, and seriously did the whole thing and was still sick, called the dboy up and accused him of selling me fake shit, but he said no one has complained about it but you so he wouldn’t do shit about it besides make my next bag stronger.  I️ knew he was adding fent to his stuff as he was honest about it.  His stuff usually had a decent rush to it, you would have to do a lot to nod out, and from the way he was adding it in, was actually safe.   He used volumetric measuring and what not, had a machine that would disperse the powder evenly throughout the mix.  He wasn’t fucking around.   So I️ grabbed a half from him this morning, he was kinda mad at me for yelling at him and accusing me of him selling me some fake dope, but he handed me the bag and said “you gotta chill man, I wouldn’t sell a bag like this to nobody but you, but I️ don’t sell fake shit and can’t be having a customer talking bad about my product” so I️ knew all he did was add some more fent to it.   I️ got Home and did a shot, and finally got myself well.   But too bad this stuff doesn’t have any legs, as it’s now midnight, I’m already sick again. 

So now I’m sitting here fucked.   Dopesick.  Know I’m addicted to fent. Pissed about it cuz there’s nothing I️ can do. Can’t get high on anyone’s dope but the two plugs I️ use. Not even if I️ put a half in the rig.  I officially don’t want to get high, I’m just so disappointed in myself.   And now I️ know it’s fent, I️ feel even more like a scumbag. Everything seriously happened soooo fast The last 4 months got out of hand, and the last month has been iv use, which got wayyyyyy more out of hand than I️ expected. 

 Here is a back story of my recent use. I️ relapsed because I️ hurt my shoulder at the gym and bought a few perc 10s thinking that my 4 years off dope would be ok if I️ was Using these really just for pain.  I️ did use them just for the pain but definitely could feel thst opiate relief and that amazing blanket feeling. So it took me about a month after that to finally ask someone, I️ asked if he had any percs and he said nah, not strong enough for me, I️ usually smoke this fent and showed me this pink powder.   I️ instantly decline not know anything about it besides it was killing all my friends. At first I️ was really skeptical but I was  always over at this dudes house because we would goto the gym together when we got out of work.   And I would see him smoke boat after boat and be ok not dead or anything and not too stupid where he couldn’t function. So eventually I️ was like fuck it man, I’ll take one hit.    First time smoking anything off of foil and I️ barely got a hit, but holy jesus did I feel amazing. So after that it was off the races, we would lift then go home and get high.   I️ would never bring anything home with me or anything for a few weeks, just toss him some money for a few hits. Then eventually I was bringing Home 20 bags, and it started getting worse and worse, it was crazy because we could get so much of it for cheap.   I️ eventually got to the point where I was getting sick, and stopped instantly and was actually doing good for a month,   But it brought back all the memories of when I️ was shooting dope, and I️ finally got a connection on some real heroin. 


After about a month or so off of the fent powder I knew what I️ wanted,  I️ really just wanted to expierence the iv rush of heroin one more time.  But I️ couldn’t bring myself to use a needle again.   So I️ started buying some of this h, and would snort maybe a line a day.   A half gram would last me a week and I️ could stay consistently high. This went on for a couple months with the habit getting slowly but surely worse.   I was soon snorting a g a day, but it was good dope so it had legs and I️ never expierenced a sickness just kinda was down when I ran out.  So I️ figured iv use would cut that at least in half, and I️ was right for like the first week I️ was probably only doing a point or two a day and I was ok.  But that’s when I️ really started to get sick, I’d wake up sick and have to do a shot before I even took a shit. Then it got to a half a week later, and the last week or two at least a gram a day maybe 1.5-2 if it’s from dude with the mediocre dope.  I️ was clean for 4 years before all of this so I️ know what I️ have to do.  I️ just have to cut all ties.   All my friends, when I was in the programs so they were real friends, all seemed to have relapsed too.   So I’m just sitting here thinking fuck I️ have to make a whole new support group and start all over again.     My life is actually going decently right now, getting back to work after a couples months of being off.   Work is great my Job is great.  I️ maintain, I️ can work through withdrawal if I have too.  But I have the next 3 days off and I️ figure I can get over the hump of the w/d and take a small piece of sub for Work And do the Robert taper plan.   


I️ kinda just went on a rant there, I️ apologize.  I️ banged some ice to get through some of the w/d tonight,  don’t know why But this works for me, I️ hate the stuff but it makes me feel ok while I’m high and I️ can actually function.    I think I️ just end up keeping myself so busy that I️ dont have time to think about being dope sick 

I️ have no problem saying no to any drug when I’m sober.   I️ just usually smoke weed, don’t drink, hate stimulants, kinda just lived the hippy life going from festival to festival.  And in those places everything you could want is around.   You can find it all out in the campgrounds, but I️ never would search for anything or buy it when the dealers came around.   I️ would occasionally take a dose or two and enjoy a day of music, but in my opinion i wasn’t doing anything hard, just things I️ believed were enhancing my life.    But the thing is now, when I’m on dope, I️ can’t say no to basically anything.   It’s turned into such almost a needle addiction. I️ Love the act of preparing and shooting up.   I️f I️ don’t have dope, idc I’ll shoot a small shot of ice or maybe some powder just to take away from the anxiety of wanting to use a needle.   I️ really think this relapse has beat me up a lot worse than I️ expected.  

But anyways, here’s my formal introduction to this community.    I love reading your stories and drooling over your pictures.    I️ hope I️ can get my life back on track and I’ll keep you all posted.  And as for the confused part of the title in my post,  how the hell did my dealer(the guy that was out for a few days) get such a long lasting relief from dopesickness, if it was all fent?",1510464708.0

Anyways, I've wanted to discuss people's opinions of being on opiates while at the movies regardless if it's a drive-in, Matinee or even midnight screenings. I've always enjoyed it, especially if it's an older movie on 35MM or movies with great cinematography and soundtracks, it makes for a more dreamlike quality to the movie.

Finally what is the antibiotic they give you so I could possibly just go to an urgent care and get script and start taking antibiotics...? Or do they have to lance/cut it open? I know I am probably freaking out over nothing and it may not even form an abcess but I want to be ready just in case. I only worry as I have no money to afford an er visit thats why I would rather do an urgent care. And finally what is your go to lie for why you have an abcess?

I started because of legitimate pain, but in 2012 I lost my best friend to an accidental morphine overdose and I lost my shit. Up until then I was selling 90% of my meds, but that stopped when she died. 
I've been a single mom thru all this.....my youngest daughter's father and I split because he thought I was cheating on him...I wish it had been that that I was hiding, instead of a blossoming heroin addiction. Would have been easier to stop an affair. For the most part my family knows nothing, especially my parents. My mom isn't stupid, she has to suspect something, especially since she's the one I hit up for money. She's also what's keeping me from asking for help. She found some rigs awhile back, and told me if she ever found out I was using drugs she wouldn't help me, she would take my kids from me.  My kids are the ONLY thing that has stopped me from just giving up and out to g a bullet in my mouth. Both of them have deadbeat absent fathers. I'm all they have. And that knowledge has kept me going until now, even thru horrible post partum depression. 
But now...I just feel like I have dug myself such a deep ass hole, and there's no way out in sight...no one to lean on for support even, just constant judgement from my family. I love my girls more than anything, definitely more than my own worthless exsistance, and I know if I don't stop soon I'm going to die. My kids have always been #1 in my life and I feel that slowly slipping away. 
I mostly lurk here, so I'm not even sure why I wrote this,or what if anything I hope to come from it. I just know that I don't want to become just another statistic lost to this bullshit.

So I'm parked on the side of the road in my car with my dog and girlfriend smoking some doobie and having a small argument. We were there for about 45 in a really nice neighborhood I know dumb AF. Well of course the cops roll up behind us and come and start talking to us I tried to feed him some bullshit like we're out of gas but he actually called my bluff and made me turn my car on. This is when I tell him that we live down the street with my girlfriend's mom and we were arguing about money so we decided to be respectful and leave her place total BS by the way. Well at this point I'd forgotten about the empty Tanqueray bottle in the back of my car so the cop uses that as probable cause to ask me to step out become detain and then search the vehicle he has my girlfriend grab my dog and sit on the sidewalk. At this moment I'm handcuffed a facing his Cruiser and he says there anything you want to tell me. so I tell him I've got a little bit of black tar in the driver side door not much mind you probably about a half a g. At this point the officer and his backup proceeded to search the entire front of the car and find might are some foil my Hooters some weed pretty much the normal Stoner junky car I don't use Rags so there was none of those. At this point the officer walks over to me and tells me that I should not be in such a nice neighborhood this late at night asked me to stand up turn around and uncuffed me and tells me to get out of there. My girlfriend and I get in the car wait for the cops to leave and start driving. I reach down for a cigarette and what do I find. My container of dope with the half gram chunk still in it.

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

My other major crush / female best friend of 3 years came out as a IV heroin addict.

Now I developed a crush on my female Co worker that I've known for one month. Like I never had sex with her, but her vibe just melts my heart and idk why. Well, the other day, another Co worker told me that she found her in her car railing a brownish white substance, more than likely heroin before she came into work.

This is super cre oy and weird. Why do I keep developing feelings for girls hooked on opiates? It isn't like I'm seeking them, and it isn't even like I know they're on them until after the crush is developed.

Years ago a buddy and I blew through his Oxycodone script. We were taking 60mg orally and feeling amazing. I could talk easily while feeling like nodding out and just melting into a chair. 

I'm just wondering what I should be expecting from 60mg of morphine. I've never tried it. Since the BO is so sniffing it up I'm just going to crush it up and swallow it. 

I've heard it does not give much euphoria as oxycodone or hydromorphone. Just more of a sedation effect. Will I still feel that pleasant body load and euphoria? 

I also heard that the nausea is intense with morphine. I have never felt nausea from high doses of hydromorphone or oxycodone, so do you think I should be alright?

A couple nights ago I got drunk, called my guy and paid double for him to deliver some shitty powder that i knew was killing me. 

The next day I spent throwing up, sick, nauseated and continued to powerful through smoking this poison. About 3:00AM I started to feel my limbs going in and out of being numb, and it was becoming clear that my kidneys were not able to process all the shit i was putting into my body. 

Between panic attacks I finally realized I was killing myself. It took me years to realize that this was actually life and death like they suggested in rehab. It seriously is. Until now I had been putting the side effects in the back of my head and making excuses that I was just ""Getting old"" and thats what happens when you're not 19 anymore. Life and death. My heart had been palpitating, I had gone to the ER once because i put me in Afib. I OD'd once and spent six days in the ICU, and further continued to numb myself because my ego couldn't cope with the fact that I wasn't in complete control, and that I wasn't invincible.

I just threw out all of my paraphernalia. I'm getting my house in order that I've been neglecting for months, and for the first time I'm willing to face the challenges of being bored or having to adapt to overcome cravings. I took the week of thanksgiving off from work, and I'm going to use the subs I have left to get me through the week, then I'm gonna withdrawal like hell and not dig myself any further into the hole I've been digging for 6 months. 

I know people make claims like this all the time and then they go right back out, and I'm not only hoping that doesnt happen... but I'm actually willing to take the steps and precautions I need to make sure I never get back to this dark depressing place that is addiction. 

Wish me luck.

My closest friend is addicted to meth, and has been for a few years. He's like my brother. I don't get to see him much, for multiple reasons; the current reason being that he's been trying to hide the extent of his drug use. He stopped for a few days a couple month back for me to come see him. He was trying to put on the illusion that he's getting clean. 

Skipping a bunch of details as not to type for hours, this is what its come to: he called a few days ago asking if he could stay with my wife and I for 3 weeks. This is something neither me or my wife are comfortable with. He has lied to us. He has been accused by his blood relation of theft (which i would not put past him...some things we lent him disappeared).

He refuses to take any responsibility for his drug use, and blames everything around him from stress to the city he stays in. He has it in his mind that he'll be able to get into a rehab facility at no cost.

On one hand, i want to help him. Like I said, he's like a brother to me. I don't have any blood family. We've been through a lot together.

On the other hand though, I know i can't trust him right now. I can't afford to feed another person. I know that within hours he'd walk the neighborhood and find a spot to cop some meth. There's drugs everywhere in my area. If he were actually trying to get clean, I'd feel terrible for having other drugs in the house, and for being high around him.

I have not yet told him the answer is no; i will be doing that tomorrow. But, I feel like I'm making the wrong decision either way. It's fucking me my head pretty bad.

I literally can't catch a break.,"So, I've been hella broke all week. Like, can't get my antibiotics for the abscess in my arm broke. Like, lucky my brothers care about me or else I wouldn't have cigs. So broke that I traded food from my job for bag of weed to help me get through because not only am I too broke for all of the above, but too broke to buy dope is definitely the biggest blessing *and* curse of the whole ordeal. My daughter had an incredibly bad but incredibly quick moving stomach nug two nights ago. Got her thru it, didn't think anything else of it. Until about 2 hours after I got home from work. For the last. 6 or 7 hours now, I have been throwing up violently, and being as I haven't had much of an appetite this week, its just straight stomach acid: yellow, small amounts, painful to throw up. And I'm literally pissing out of my ass, and I can NOT keep water down to save my life. All I want to do is just drink my big ass cup of ice water and sleep. So after about 3-4 hours of this hell, I started wondering if maybe this was tied to my WD. So u hit up a friend who doesn't really fuck with the black except for to get it for me. Homie is the best middle ever so far, and he brought me .6 on front to last me til I got cash. Stand up dude. After he dropped it off, I immediately cooked a decent enough shot, but the vein immediately, and as soon as the rush took over (took the shot while shitting water on the toilet and throwing up all my water into the waste basket) I felt better. Cleaned up a little of my sick mess, actually was able to smoke a cig without making me throw up again, I was even able to drink some water. Decided I wanted one more shot before bed to help me sleep. Melt down the dope, draw it up into the rig, hi to insert the needle into my vein, and the FUCKING NEEDLE SNAPPED OFF THE GODDAMN SYRINGE!!!! Luckily it didn't snap off inside me but, the only rig I had left broke while fully loaded with a dark brown shot. I thought about smoking some but I have never been able to smoke up without coughing real bad, and right now that will 100% lead to vomiting. 

tl;dr - been horrendously sick, not sure with what, dope seems to help calm me down (got two hours of sleep after I banged that one shot) and I broke my last rig, leaving me with something that will make me feel better that I can't use. Just shoot me.",1510575597.0

I may, I doubt it but possibly failed my last drug test. I do not and cannot go the sub route cuz then my work (I contract for the navy in finance) will know I was using again.

I go 2-3 days not thinking about it then on the 3rd or 4th day I just fucking want dope. I want the rush. I've lost interest in all of my hobbies like working out, hanging with friends shooting the shit. When I come home from work I just chill with my fam cuz I'm trying to establish trust so I eat dinner at my parents and watch tv and talk to my dad about work cuz he's in a similiar position but he works for the gov. Even when I'm with my gf I think about dope. She had a bad k addiction but is doing better though she did an 8 ball with me of K at a zeds dead concert last night (it was fucking nutssssss). I love designer drugs I did 4 caps of molly and a shit ton of k and fishscale last night but nothing compares to dope. I'm so scared I'm gonna get strung out again. Also, I have had a few really scary ODs recently. For one of them I was approx dead for 2 mins cuz my friend is used to seeing me pass out but this time my face and lips turned purple after a min so he had to hit me with Narcan (thank god he did I really don't want to die)

In college I was prescribed concerta 36 and Valium for my anxiety. My anxiety now is so bad that I have tremors and when I do dope half the time I have to have someone hit me cuz my hands don't function. I've always had struggles with ADHD and ADD. On Saturday I did some adderral and gabapentin while my gf was at work and that combo had me feeling normal. 

Should I see a psychiatrist? I've heard different answers from friends which have confused me.  I know it sounds pathetic but at this point right now I need a daily pick me up. I feel I'm so scared, anxious, and maybe even depressed to the point that I need something.

I've heard just quit the dope. When you're an IV user it's not that easy. I'm not strung out. I have been slowing down. I really could use your help guys and gals. Below are a couple recent pics of me. I'm healthy, at a good weight, I have a great family and Job. But trust me I've been to hell and back. No one can see the pain in my eyes. My life is one big facade. I feel terrible for my past and I know I'm going to hell for the things that I've done. I've seen murder, death, OD, the nastiest trap houses you could imagine. I've seen a lady put a bag over a dogs head because she couldn't afford to feed the dog (I saved the dog and took him to the shelter he has a forever home now). My good friend was murdered shot in the face sleeping. I've seen too much for being so young and living in a very rich part of our country. I want to feel normal and provide for my family and my gf and my friends. And I definitely do not want to die.

I *love* opiates, but I'm a weird heroin user. I get addicted, quit my addiction after a short while, stay clean for 6mo-1.5yrs, then pick it up again and repeat. I pick it up intentionally and I actually kind of view it as cleansing, like a little vacation. A reset button on life.

EDIT: I AM NOT ADVISING THIS. Know yourself, know your weaknesses, and be smart about them.

I've been doing this for about 9 years now. During that time I've graduated from college, went to grad school, had stable and fulfilling relationships, bought a home, and have formed a successful career. I have a savings, stocks, and a 401k. I've never been in legal trouble with drugs despite periods of heavy use.

Doing drugs in this manner has taught me *a lot* about myself and addiction. I sometimes make it sound easy but it *is not* easy. My success thus far, however, puts me in a unique position to hopefully be able to give some useful advice.

Successful quitting depends on a few key things in my opinion:

**Obtainable Goals:**

You need to set obtainable goals. If you've been a heavy user for 10 years straight you can't expect to drop the needle tomorrow. You'll likely fail, you'll get discouraged, and that might prevent you from trying again later.

Instead, set incremental, obtainable goals: Baby steps. At first, these shouldn't even be related to drug use (I'm actually against tapering). An example might be: 'Today I'm going to paint a painting. Tomorrow, I'll wash the floor.'  Get used to setting small goals for yourself and living up to those goals. This brings me to my next section:

**Train Willpower:**

* Your ability to quit depends on your willpower
* Willpower is a muscle
* Your addiction has weakened this muscle
* In order to quit, you must strengthen your willpower
* To strengthen your willpower: *do things you hate*

The best way to do this is to *set small goals* (meta) to do things you hate but are not bad for you. An example might be taking an ice cold shower, cleaning your apartment, or (if you can) exercise. If you hate carrots, go eat carrots. If you hate art museums, go to the art museum. Get used to forcing yourself to do unpleasant things. It builds willpower, and willpower will be needed to successfully quit.

Sidenote: Seems obvious, but if you start liking something it no longer counts as something you hate. 

**Test the waters:**

As you develop willpower, start testing the waters with your addiction. Most users have tried and failed to quit. Instead, quit for longer and longer periods of time. If you're a heavy user, start with a day. Moderate user, maybe suffer through a withdrawal cycle. If less heavy, quit for a week or two. Do this a handful of times and *accept that these are test runs and not your final sendoff*. This serves several purposes:

* Familiarizes you with the feelings you'll experience
* Avoids discouragement
* *Builds willpower*
* Lowers tolerance

Don't make the decision to fully quit haphazardly. Train for it and prepare for it. You should have tested the waters several times, and have a good idea of what you'll experience.

Sidenote: Be *VERY CAREFUL* not to OD if resuming usage. Start small!!

**Perform a ritual:**

When you finally are ready, perform a ritual as a sendoff. No, you don't have to dance around any fires naked (unless you want to). However, you should do something tying you to this moment. Consider burying (literally) some part of your life or lighting a sky lantern.

**Quit:**

Personally I've always found cold turkey to be most effective.

**Recognize that withdrawal is the easy part:**

Acute withdrawal is, in my opinion, one of the easier parts. Not only are you face-to-face with one of the worst aspects of the drug, but you haven't used up all of your willpower yet. 

The hardest days are the ones that follow. The hollow, empty ones where you have no friends, no-one to talk to, and you're pretty sure your family hates you. It is important to continue training willpower--these days are why we train.

**Replacement:**

Replace your addiction with something less harmful. Running and yoga are popular among ex-addicts, and for a reason. If you're worried about replacing one addiction for another: don't be. Baby steps. Worry about that in a year.

Hope this helps!",1510550810.0

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I have never run out before, and I have been having the most excruciating fibromyalgia flare up the past 5 days. I only get oxycodone 10mg 4 times a day, so not a big script and it just hasn't been helping enough during this flare up. 

I went to the urgent care yesterday, and the doctor told me she couldn't do anything for me and to go to the hospital because they'd most likely be able to help me with pain. She was a nice enough woman, and also recommended I tell my doctor to order tests for rheumatoid arthritis. Well, I can't afford to go to the hospital, and am already stuck with an urgent care bill. My deductible is very high and I have not yet found a different insurance provider during open enrollment. 

I have 1 pill left and I see my doctor tomorrow. Should I just tell him that I'm out (one week early) or just go through the WD and wait?

EDIT:
UPDATE:
So I go to my appointment, tell him about everything that went on this month and how I'm having a horrible flare up and my current meds just aren't helping. I didn't tell him I ran out, but every time I brought up medication he kept telling me to take this Tizanidine shit that makes me very nauseous, and even gave me refills on it. I've tried it and it helps but it really doesn't do shit when I'm in this much pain. Relax my muscles all you want, other parts of my body hurt too and all it's doing is making me sick more than anything. He didn't talk about the oxycodone once, and I really don't think he would give it to me at all if I hadn't been getting it for a few years now.

I'm extremeley disappointed because it seems like he brushed off everything I said. I wanted trigger point injections too, but it seemed like he just kind of rushed through everything. He also didn't order any bloodwork or tests for rheumatoid arthritis like that doctor at the urgent care suggested. He just doesn't seem like he cares about pain management.
 
I fucking hate this. This shit is what I dealt with for years and it's so fucking rare to find a pain management doctor that actually gives a shit if you're hurting. On my way out, I passed by an office with the door open where the doctor I just saw, the owner of the practice, and two CNAs were listening to a phone call ON SPEAKER with a patient explaining how badly she is in pain. I heard somebody say, ""Yes *name* you're just going through withdrawals. That's part of it,"" in a very dismissive tone. It made me both disgusted and thankful I didn't mention that I was out of meds because I'm pretty certain I would have been dropped from the program immediately. I fucking HATE the owner of the practice; he's a manipulative, sexist, judgmental asshole that tried to make me take a bunch of sample medication that could have killed me, all because he didn't look at my chart and see that these medicines are very dangerous when combined with some of the other stuff I was already on. He had such a condescending look on his face when listening to this poor woman on the phone, and how unprofessional is that to blast her when there are patients that can easily hear?

I really appreciate everyone's advice, and I wish I had a doctor that just put in the effort. I don't see him being there for long, simply because he's new and I'm sure he's just there to get experience until he finds a job in healthcare that he actually wants to do. Now I'm fucked for a week, don't have any connects around here, and am just going to have to suffer through.",1510538678.0

I've been lurking here for about 2 months now on and off and today something happened I'd never thought would happen to me. 

As a bit of backstory: I'm generally unlucky. I've once found 50 bucks on the street and that's literally it. I've never won any sort of contests or anything. My real life RNG (for you non MMORPG nerds that's luck) is essentially 0. 

Last night, me and my homeboy decided to celebrate me being clean off dope and pills for 2 months so we hit up my man and ordered a gram of coke. All goes well, we have a blast, smoke some weed and have a great time together till we run out and he has to leave because it's 5 AM at this point, plus my friend still had to walk for at least 30 minutes to get home. I go to bed and just chill and read 1984 and pass out.

Today I wake up and realise I'm almost all of out bud. As I start thinking of how I can fix this problem I start rolling myself a joint but I can't find my tips. After 5 minutes of scrambling around on my messy as fuck desk that I can't be arsed to clean I suddenly notice a pretty big, white and glistening chunk. I gently took a little taste with the tip of my tongue and it turns out I have enough coke left to last me the whole night. 

I've never had shit like this happen to me, not even after 7 years of daily opiate/benzo use. I am the happiest boyo alive right now.

I offered to a girl to talk to her and get her clean. She really wants to go to rehab and get off of dope, get off of coke, and not die. I said aight cool I will help you out with that. 

She has pain issues, has hyper anxiety issues, does have a medical need for benzos. Was on soma for pain management from a doc who cut her off after she dropped dirty. Got put on such a high dose of benzos by another doc- who I found out she was sleeping with- that if she goes without for 24 hours she will have a seizure. Keeps asking me to find her a place to go but no place will take her without going 24 hours without being high except a detox which can taper her. 

But she won't go to the detox since asshole doc who she fucked told her all the stuff she is on would take a 6month long detox in a hospital, but won't make the fucking recommendation because it is more convenient for him to just have her look crazy and die since he would lose his medical license and probably be charged.

So I have like a dozen different places set up, all ethical not insurance fraud joints. She refuses to go to any of them since she is convinced that if she goes off soma at all she would die. Even though they offer all a nice long taper and shit. But she refuses to even consider the option so I said well I can lock you up in a psych ward or in my basement or some shit but if you want to have a nice comfy taper with a nice comfy bed and docs watching you then you should probably be okay with going off the soma for 24 hours. Otherwise you don't get to go to a cushy rehab to kick.

I got this bitch scholarships, round the clock care, the promise of a month long taper so she don't feel shit, and she still doesn't want it. So fuck it. Do your thing but don't fucking bother me.",1510527552.0

Should I start going down to 1.5 instantly starting now?
 Or even 1g as my first step down? Then .25g each successive step? 

I'm not sure the best plan of attack is. Trying to save for a new phone. Been wanting the s8 since before it was released and it costs less than my weekly reup. I'll probably be getting just quarter pieces each reup instead of halves since my connect raised prices and it's not worth it at the current pricepoint. 

Felt I should also mention I'm not getting high at all with the amount of tolerance I have. Haven't in a long time. I basically need to smoke .5-1g in a sitting to feel something. Nothing better than waking up and actually feeling something since I'm able to sleep 12hrs. But after that just redosing all day leads to just staying well unless I trail an absurd amount.

Suboxone on the other hand, with my tolerance, it seems I could get 32 doses out of a 16mg strip. And a 16mg strip is $20. So that seems way cheaper. How is the high of suboxone though?

Kratom is also another thing I have thought about but I didn't really plan on buying it because of tolerance + it's more expensive and it's not a true opiate. 

My tolerance is low because I've been off of opiates for 3 weeks. Broke as fuck and I already went through WDs. I can get some sleep because I have lots of valium but I feel like shit all the time and can't stop craving. Not willing to use heroin yet.

Doctors should go on strike.,"The god damn DEA is probably one of the biggest reasons why doctors are too afraid to provide proper pain relief to patients, because they know it's very possible for their medical licenses to be revoked, or them going to jail and/or facing some big fine... all for being compassionate. But then again, when you have a group of fucking idiots who aren't even smart enough to dream of being a doctor one day, who work in the DEA and obv have no idea what it's like being a chronic pain patient or a doctor wanting to help them out. And it's been proven that like a tiny tiny subset of blatantly crooked doctors/pill mills provided the huge majority of the illicit or abused pills. Way to punish everyone for the fuck-ups of the few. 

So anyway, I just thought like... 'I wonder if like every non-urgent doctor, mainly ones like pain management ones, other specialists, primary care physicians, maybe even pharmacists too, went on strike until the DEA backed off and let them do their jobs."" IMO that'd be pretty effective, since tons of people want to see doctors, and with only like ER docs and ambulance EMTs around, people will start to hate the DEA real quick. Hopefully the average joe schmo idiot will then finally realize how fucked the DEA is, and public opinion/support for them will plummet. But then again I could see a lot of doctors being apprehensive in doing so, fearing repercussions, and, at least AFAIK, doctors aren't usually union employees, and don't have such protections for going on strike (as well as strike pay, but a lot of doctors seemingly have a good amount of savings to live on for the duration of the strike), or they're apathetic about the whole situation; maybe it doesn't even really effect them, and they don't care enough about compassion and preventing the govt./others in general from interfering/preventing them from doing their jobs, and wouldn't wanna be in on it. 

Idk, this just popped into my head, and I thought that this'd make a good point of discussion on here. Although I wouldn't be surprised if this is a sorta 'preaching to the choir' situation here, since I'm sure most of us on here are very much pro-individual rights, pro-government staying out of our lives, and anti-DEA/anti-drug war. But I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say about this. Anyone else here ever think of something similar? And yeah, I'm sure the success rate would probably be pretty low, due to many reasons, but one can dream, right? lol lmk what you guys think. Be safe everyone, and happy nods!",1510505057.0
7cg9dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7cg9dm/tips_on_opium_pills/,8,https://redd.it/7cg9dm,Toosome,Tips on opium pills," 
Hello fellow Redditors. I have in my possesion a pack of lamaline. Each pill consists of 300 mg of paracetamol (AKA acetaminophen), 10 mg of opium and 30 mg of caffeine.

Can I get high of this? I know that if you consume too much paracetamol  (AKA acetaminophen), you will damage your liver seriously and it's a very common incident unfortunately, but only if you reach over 4 grams per day (I think). But to do this, I would have to swallow more than 10 pills, which I think would be more than necessary to reach a good high. Maybe the paracetamol is disrupting this though? I don't know.

I've seen that you can perform CWE (cold water extraction), but is this really necessary?
I'd like to try it though, sounds fun but risky and I lack the tool to measure degrees.

I have never tried opium pills before so I don't know what to expect from this,but I have some experience with tramadol. Tramadol is a super great opiate in my opinion but is hard to get. I really love it but you have to respect it and learn how to handle it, it can be very dangerous.

A long time ago I had a very weird reaction from it. It turned my penis very swollen into a shape of a tennisball (I'm not kidding). But fortunatly there was no pain and nothing bad happened, I just had to wait a day to get my penis back again. I guess I had taken too much.

Thanks for reading this and I hope my writing isn't too bad or confusing! Share your thoughts and tips.

I'm not in any serious debt or bankrupt or anything like that, but it would be nice to save some money! It's frustrating the amount of money I make and yet can't seem to build my savings.

Yes, that's the cliche answer, but I think it's a cop-out answer, and probably just a widely accepted myth.

Is it safe to use a filter (rolled up end of a q-tip) twice for IV coke and is a ""proper"" hit similar to a hit of smoked crack in the sense that intense nausea is almost guaranteed?

First off this is rather long but imo the more info you know the better. Also, rather than opiates I'm using coke (some of the best I've had round my way for a minute) so I apologise for this not being opi-related, but I know some of us here snowball so it's kinda relevant in that respect and a lot of us here IV so I thought this would be the best place to ask! But I digress...

When I prepare a shot, I roll up the end of a cotton bud (q-tip for those of you across the pond) as tightly as I can to use for a filter. I then drop water onto the little ball to get it wet to minimise wicking (like you do to the filter used when you CWE) and proceed to mix my stuff, plop the wet cotton ball into the mix and draw up. 

Now here comes the main point with a few questions to follow: 

- When I prepare the next shot I do the same process but with the same filter. I press it down to ""wring"" out what's left from the previous shot in the plain water to minimise waste and try to get as much out of it as possible. Is it safe to do this considering I only use the same filter twice?

- As I have been very careful with my doses I now have an idea as to how much I need to use to get a good hit. When I used to smoke crack it used to make me feel really nauseous for a few minutes so will it be the same with IV coke?

I understand that I sound like a complete noob - which is semi-true - I just live by the mantra ""knowledge is power"" and harm reduction is top banana; I would just like to hear from seasoned users if I am doing anything wrong and whether or not I need to prepare for the violent ejection of my stomach contents.

Thanks everyone, stay safe and big love to all. 👌

Obviously it is well known that opioids induce euphoria within a good many who partake...a mellow relaxed high that many folks come to love, but I think there is sometthing more and deeper to the draw...

I was reading a novel (""The Devil's Bag Man by Adam Mansback, an absolutely killer book for anyone that loves to read), and something within the novel brought me to a what I feel might be some deeper insight and  understanding regarding the ""nod"" state so many of us lovers of opioids seek out...

I haven't heard this mentioned before, and though it's an original thought from my mind, it has probably been surmised before...

I don't know how other people feel about this, but I have always been fascinated by dreams...finding them awesomely entertaining and utterly fascinating, even when they are deeply disturbing...

I feel like achieving the ""nod"" state is synonymous with dreaming while awake...as someone who loves a great dream, and hates when the powerful emotions and feelings of a dream dramatically fade upon awakening, I feel like part of the insatiable appetite for the opioid high/nod has to do with yearning for the ability to be able to experience the state of dreaming while being more fully conscious then when asleep...

I'd love to hear what other folks have to say about this, I mean obviously when you are nodding it's similar to being asleep and dreaming, and consciousness is greatly diminished, but it seems like it allows one to keep one foot in the realm of dreams, while one foot remains in conscious awareness... you are able to toggle bac and forth and relish the dream state in a way where you are more conscious and able to enjoy it compared to the state it is experienced when one is asleep...

I hope this generates some interesting discussion... as a side not I have found things like astral projection and lucid dreaming to be utterly fascinating, and an area I would love to further eplore. I fond myself wondering if this facet of my interests might have anything to do with my draw towards the opioid high and the nod...

I loo forward to hearing what some of you folks might have to say about this idea, I've never really heard it discussed before, and would love to hear if I'm alone or not in this realization...",1510642102.0

This is due to many reasons, whether it be denial, anxiety, stress, you name it. I've finally come to terms with myself and my habit. I am an oxycodone addict. I'm a recent college grad who unfortunately spent my junior and senior years addicted to oxys. It's incredible how fogged up your brain gets when you are taking these damn pills... I need advice. I need help. I have no one else to turn to and after coming here and reading post after post from all of you kind individuals, I finally decided it was time to reach out. A little background info and I apologize for this wall of text... I have been addicted for roughly 2 years. It started out as a once a weekend thing, until before I knew it, I was up to 90-120mgs/day. In the past 2 years I have had one clean stint of 1 month long and 4 random weeks spread throughout the months due to lack of money, or a sudden realization of how much of a fuckup I am. Basically, it's time to quit. Should have quit months ago, but nows finally the time. I am ready. These past 6 days, I've taken a total of 35 oxy 30s and finally ran out tonight at around 10:30EST(also took 2mg xanax). I have 2 8mg suboxone to fall back on and intend on taking them sparingly and only on an ""as needed"" basis. The plan is to take 1mg tomorrow at 10:30 and hope that is long enough time to avoid PWD and is a sufficient amount to take away the withdrawals. Pretty much, I need advice from all of you. How should I plan this taper schedule? Can I actually taper off with 16mg of sub and have little to no withdrawal? Am I giving myself enough time in-between doing 30s and dosing sub? Any input is greatly appreciated. I really need to quit and I know I won't be able to do it alone. Nobody knows about this habit. You all are who I need most right now. I have spent close to $30,000 in the past 4 months on these damn pills.. The anxiety is crushing me. I'm so worried I am going to lose my job I have worked so hard to obtain and it kills me to reach out to you guys, because i know there are plenty of you who have it way worse than me and I am truly blessed to have not hit rock bottom yet. Please provide me with some sort of taper plan or any words of encouragement you can provide. I truly appreciate this from all of you. Much love and godspeed.

TLDR; 2 year oxy addict. 90-180mg/day for the past 2 months. Probably spent over 100k over the 2 year span. CC maxed out. Ran out of pills tonight, have 16mg of sub. Need any form of advice on how to approach this.

Thank you so much everyone.",1510637427.0

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

The winter is a junkies bane. The cold seeps into your bones and and twists them with pain. 

The phone ring, and it's who I'm waiting for. For a brief moment the excitment and anticipation take away the pain. But it comes back when he says it will be two hours more. I groan and roll into my bed. 

I think that this must be hell. My own personal hell. I roll over and over. I think about all I have lost, my family i have alienated and pushed away witb drugs and bad choices. 

I watch the clock for two hours and thirty minutes before calling him three times in a row until he answered. 

"" hey bro I'm outside, I-)

I didn't let him finish. I sprint outside and hop into the mustang sitting in my driveway. . He appears to be trying to eat his ear, as tweaked as I have ever seen him. I hand him 120 bucks, he hands me 4 blues. I tell him thank you. I could have kissed that possum eyes tweaker hillbilly on the lips I was so estatic. Before he gets a chance to start an endless rambling conversation, as he usually does, I tell him I'll hit him up tomorrow and sprint inside. 


I shake so hard drawing up the murky blue fluid through a cotton I strike the needle on the bottom of my trusty spoon. The needle bends. A thick burr is on the end. Its no matter. My arms are already beat and there is no way this shit isn't going in my veins.

The unsurprisingly dull needle pops into my skin with a little resistance, and then a little more when I slip into old faithful laying in the V between my thumb and forefinger. It hurts. 

I'm not too shaky to hit a vein, the blood that begins to fill the syringe looks like a mushroom clouds. I decide that is rather fitting and push the plunger.

Warmth. Relief. Stillness, inside and out. I feel what is close to pure joy, but not close enough.  A smile creeps into the corner of my mouth, I light a cigarette and close my eyes. The aromatic smoke fills my lungs, as I blow it out I think to myself, ""I have to get clean, because almost every day of a junkie is nearly the same""

So I tend to get dope in larger quantities (7-14g max or something like 50 Oxies) and WD in between with hopes of never getting back and crying in loneliness - aka ""the usual"". It's important to get it in large quantities much less frequently.

Now, when the shit comes, what I do, is I create few emergency portions and hide them well. From the perspective of me getting new shit, I don't care. I have more than enough for now, and I won't be running out anytime soon so it doesn't phase me at all. By the time I run out I don't even remember where and if I put aside anything at all.

Eventually when the inevitable comes knocking on your door to collect the happiness tax, you'll be damn guaranteed® to start searching in panic for any bit of dope left.

I’ve spent the last 8 years working in harm reduction from street outreach, to working at the second largest needle exchange program (millions of syringes a year!), to managing my own exchange site, working as a peer counselor, running harm reduction book club, phlebotomist at nx site, and finally HIV test counselor.

I’m not an active drug user (besides nicotine and occasional caffeine). 

I’d be happy to explain or answer any questions about how needle exchange programs work from funding, working with local government, managing and recruiting volunteers, HIV/Hep C testing, buying nx supplies at an institutional level, writing and distributing harm reduction literature, other HR interventions, how to do outreach, how to teach new outreach workers, wound care/providing medical treatment to underserved populations, Narcan distribution/programs, HR research/stats, ethics in HR, community organizations and public health policy and pretty much anything else HR related.

My friend said this subreddit might be interested, and I’m happy to help.

A nice little chunker of bth for a pretty solid wake up shot, and your boy, Mr. fuckin bitch ass fuck head boner (me haha) drops the shit on my desk and it bounces and I hear one click from an undisclosed location on my floor/maybe office chair and that's it. Done this a couple times, so im like shit, but no big deal I'll find it in a few seconds. Anyway not in immediate view and I scramble and scramble and no luck as the impending FUCKING DOOM creeps into the forefront of my mind minute after minute after second after fucking minute until I'm tearing apart my organized, clean ass baller lounge of a room I cleaned, remodelled, and organized last night, as hilarity would have it. No luck after 45 minutes and I'm SUPER FUCKING PISSED CUSSING myself out, etc. Finally, I get a smidge of an idea. Hey maybe it didn't hit the floor at all. Checked everywhere else and even though I ran my fingers where I could in the nooks of my office chair, it was to no avail. So, in last, desperate hope my junkie ass takes apart the center mechanics of the chair.. did that and shook the seat and what clanged out and hit my floor WAS MY SOLID MORNING CHUNK!!!! the heavens then descended and my morning is saved.

Many of the negative effects, especially those we experience as dependent individuals occurs due to tolerance, dose escalation and downregulation of the endogenous opioid system (fewer, less sensitive MOPs) and an increase in the level of signalling from other excitatory neurochemical pathways. 
Acute withdrawal is often the result of an upregulated overactive noradrenergic system combined with increased glutamatergic neurotransmission. These develop rapidly and are lost rapidly (although when withdrawing a week of the brain downregulating these upregulated systems in response to acute opioid withdrawal seems anything but rapid). 

It has been shown that many of the downstream compensatory pathways that are activated in response to chronic opioid use are triggered by opioid receptor internalisation.  Morphine, Heroin, Fentanyl all bind to the MOP causing its phosphorylation and eventual internalisation (as well as releasing a G-Protein from the complex leading to the positive subjective opioid effects. 

TRV130 is an opioid optimised for maximum G-Protein signalling (pain relief, sedation, euphoria) and minimal beta-arrestin2 signalling (internalisation, tolerance and physical dependence). 

It doesn’t feel like morphine to take, nor does it sedate as much as Fentanyl. I have used it to replace my entire Fentanyl and morphine usage for the last 2 days and have not suffered any WD or ill effects. Nor have I had to escalate the dose. 
I plan to continue the experiment for the rest of the week. 

Please take some time to read the [link](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/ChenetalJMedChem2013_TRV130leadop.pdf) to see how this opioid with unique and possibly very positive features for those dependent, in pain requiring excessive opioid doses due to tolerance and for those new opioid users in acute leading to chronic pain that may avoid rapid dose escalation and tachyphylaxis with this interesting almost licenced chemically unique opioid drug. 
There is also a Wikipedia article for TRV130 which contains less information but may be more accessible to everyone. 

(When licensed, if not before, this drug is bound for schedule 2, so any others interested in synthesis out there, the enclosed paper will also sure give you some ideas on how to modify TRV130, once scheduled, to produce legal analogs (until those get scheduled also), as it did for myself)

I lost the crooks of my arms, and I have a really hard time hitting other veins for no particular reason (I have really good veins too). I live in NJ so my dope is ECP (powder) and the veins in my forearm have a lot of scar tissue so they're pretty hardened and sore.

I couldn't hit any other vein so I went to my left forearm which I've left alone for a few days (really didn't want to use it but I'm desperate). I drew a tiny bit of blood, tried to dig around for some more blood and got some more to the point where I felt comfortable. I injected just a little bit - it didn't burn at all (it usually would, and I've missed a tiny drop with this same dope and it'll burn if I missed), so I kept going little by little until it was all gone. In the back of my mind I don't feel like I registered well enough, but it didn't burn at all, everything was fine after, and all was well. I didn't really feel the rush I usually feel, but I had also done a lot an hour prior to this one, and was just doing these 2 bags to get  as much of a nod as I could.

If I press to where the vein is, right before the scar tissue that I'm trying to avoid is, there is the tiniest of tiny bumps (where I IV'd). You have to press to feel it and it's barely noticeable. Doesn't hurt, isn't warm, isnt swollen, isn't red at all: nothing. But for some reason I still have some gut feeling that I missed.

So, the reason for this post is - can I still have missed even though I didn't experience any of the burning/symptoms of a miss? Does it always go the same way? Or did I just get lucky and I was registered enough to get it all in there without a problem?


TLDR ---- feel like I missed a shot but there wasn't any pain/burning, no symptoms, no redness, no swelling, no lumps/bumps, no nothing - I did register SOMEWHAT but I just kind of pulled the trigger on a whim because I was frustrated. Can you still miss without experiencing any symptoms? Would be the first shot I ever fully missed.",1510726917.0

It's crazy to think of how far I've come. Moved over 1000 miles away from my home state to a warmer land, winter has never been better. I weighed 130 pounds in May at my worst as a daily IV heroin/meth addict (6 foot 2 inch tall male) and I have gained 60 pounds !  I also have maintained the same job for 6 months and recently purchased a car registered and insured in my name. I'm registered for college in January and of course getting high still has it's appeal. But after going to an NA meeting tonight it just doesn't feel like an option.

Know that you can quit, it takes some courage and pain getting through the withdrawals, but in the end if you are REALLY sick and tired of being sick and tired, there are so many good rehabs in US, Canada, Europe, etc if that is an option. It worked wonders for me.

Not sure if I can do this but if anyone is in the American South West, there's a drug/alcohol treatment program I live at that is phenomenal. It's a ranch outside of town with animals and around 30-35 dudes at any given time that CARE a lot about their sobriety. The awesome thing is that it's a mere $700 a month which includes food and rent and treatment. Thats a steal compared to other programs charging thousands.

Or at least I thought.. If you dont Im about to really help you out!! Enjoy,"So I just recently saw a post somewhere with a picture of a pill and someone asking if it were fake or not, and I'm not gonna lie this kind of blew my mind.  First that people are still trying to detect if pills are fake or not by looking at it (which I guess can help sometimes but others its impossible and the fakes look better than the real ones) and the fact that by not knowing how to test for this and the current situation of the market these days that its ridiculous and I can only imagine how many times you've been ripped off and will continue to get ripped off, so I thought I'd share this method I learned, and hopefully it will help you guys out in detecting fakes just as much as its helped me.  Enjoy!

When purchasing prescription medication off the street's these days you at constant risk of purchasing fake or imitation shit, claiming to be one medication but in return getting a pill filled with a bunch of fillers and food coloring leaving you on the verge of withdraw and begging for anything just to get well.  So that's why I am going to let you in on a little secret I know, that someone taught me wayyyy back in the day and has been saving my ass ever since.  Because it might not be your dealers intentions to sell you fake shit but you never know when your going to come up on the shit and whether they knew or not you don't want to be the one getting stuck with the shit at the end of the day.  So use these quick couple of steps to test your medications before buying them and hopefully you wont be fucked and posting pictures like the kid mentioned above hoping that you have real shit when you and I both know if hes posting on here asking.. Its most likely fake shit.. 

So lets begin..

How to test if the medication is bunk or not.. 

When purchasing the medication what you want to do is take the pill itself and tap it lightly on your tongue.  I'm not talking slobber all over it, just one simple light tap on the tongue should do and you should be able to tell in a matter of seconds.  Also if done correctly the person your buying them from will have no idea what you even just did nor care because it wont affect the medication what so ever and if you end up not wanting it just hand the shit back and say no its fake and there's nothing they can really do in the first place.  

So don't ask if you can tap it on your tongue just ask to see it and take a few out at random and tap them on your tongue.  If the medication is real when tapping it on your tongue you'll immediately be able to tell.  The pill will have a sour, lemony, prescriptiony pill taste, that can be immediately' noticed and hard to explain but if you a prescription pill of some kind next to you (which I'm sure most of you have ;) ) grab that thing and tap it on your tongue and you will soon see what I am talking about.  Its almost exactly like what a fresh bottle of oxy smells like the second you get them from the pharmacy and open it up for the first time and inhale that beautiful chemical smell into your lungs.  Its that but in taste..


Now if the medication is fake or bunk and the guy is trying to rip you off.  The will will almost have the complete opposite affect once tasting it.  Instead of being pungent and sour and lemony, electric.  It will instead be so bland, chalky, tasteless, and seriously feel like its almost repelling the moisture off of your mouth and will taste like absolutely nothing, except chalk.  



You'd be surprised about how many real looking fakes are out there.  So much so that one time I got sold 1,000 fake pills back in the day and they looked so real that I used to take 2 out of 5 pills and replace them with the fakes and bet people that if they could pick the two fakes out of the group that I would give them the 3 real ones that were in there and let them look at it and examine them in any way possible, yet unfortunately no one knew this technique and no one was ever able to detect the 2 fake ones out of the group, but if they'd of known this method it would of been as easy as 123 and I would of been out of three of my shit.l haha

However, this method hasn't stopped me from buying fake pills since I learned it because honestly most of the time we are getting ripped of the con artist whose doing the deal knows whats going on and will distract you enough to the point where your going to hand the money over before ever being able to get the chance to look at shit.  So you've got to be smart when doing these things, and just remember when its to good to be true, or when you have the feeling you about to get ripped off.. Most of the time you are and you should just get the fuck out no matter how hard that is at times, but just try your best to get out of the situation and definitely don't hand over any money.

Because think, you and I both know that if someone if going to have a problem with you looking at the shit before purchasing it, most of the time its not a good situation.  You don't need to see them all.. Just one will do the trick.  So give it your best shot and just remember this the next time you buying your medication!

  So I've been in this really dark place fantasizing suicide and planning how to do it. Luckily I've already pawned all my guns or that would've happened already so it's slamming my car into a wall at 9o or taking a nosedive off my apartment building... I don't know if I can wait long enough to get my next check on Monday to just od and go be with my baby.... 

Im just lost man. Im sick of this rollercoaster of wheeling and dealing... I haven't slept for more than 20 min at a time for the past three days and needless to say I've already taken advantage of my family one to many times for them to give me cash... So im stuck in a constant state of hell... 

What is the process to getting Suboxone? 

How much does it usually cost? 

Please don't give an outpouring of ""hang in there man's"" BC that's not what im looking for. I just need help cleaning up my act so I can live for the both of us. 

We both lurk on this sub everyday and love the community.... But yeah what will I expect going to dr",1510715523.0

Search result -The noun recovery refers to the process of healing after an illness.

-----For me, kratom has definitely allowed me to heal.

Search result -Recovery is sometimes used as a synonym for ""being in remission""

-----For me, kratom has definitely helped my addiction to heroin to be in remission. And then in turn my mind and body.

PSYCHOLOGY TODAY: In most of life, ""being in recovery"" means a person is making progress even though she/he isn't ""cured."" -Lance Dodes M.D. Addiction Doctor

Someday Kratom may not be available for you to try, so if you ever wanted to try it for opiate addiction, the sooner the better.

And for those of you that tried it and did not feel anything you have to do it kind of like subs, you have to wait till you are in withdrawals to start, it is very light compared to the other stuff we take: ie-subs, methadone, heroin

Saved my life and want your life saved too. Whatever it takes..

I am an addict. I accept that fact. I am in extreme pain from a broken metatarsal fracture on the pinkie side. 

I asked for pain medication, as I am on suboxone trying to fix my life. The buprenorphine does not provide pain relief.   

I care about my life and I talked to my pain management/suboxone prescriber and he said it was alright to stop the suboxone to get pain medication to be effective for my broken foot. 

They refused any pain medication of narcotic nature. I was not looking for a high. I'm in extreme pain and needed help, and was refused. 

I am not angry. Just upset that I'm labeled as a drug seeking addict and refused help for my pain. 

Thank you for inquiring

So I decided it would be easier to give her a more powerful laptop from the trash heap. Nonetheless, I spent time and I did some good work so she got me a sub. Later that week she's bugging me on a friday evening after a long day and I'm just like ""I need to wind down, I had a long day and I just found out that I need to wake up at 6AM tomorrow.""

That evening she bought it up a couple of times how she helped me out last week but she didn't bring up much detail. Two nights later after a twelve hour work day I bought her an HDMI cable. Although it was free, I indicated that it cost me money. She asked me to bring it for use with a blu-ray player. So when I handed it to her she asked me if I could come up to help her with it.

&nbsp;

Upon explaining to her how simple it would be to plug the HDMI cable into her blu-ray player she explains she wanted help with the cable TV web app which I had already told her I'd address the following day. 

I explain to her that I'm currently setting up a new laptop to give to her and she brings up the fact that she already helped me and I'm like ""I got you, and you already have the HBO apps on your fire stick, use that for now..""

She then bugs me more. Brings up how she helped me the week prior with Suboxone and I'm just trying to shut her up because I didn't tell her brother that I got a sub that day. 


&nbsp;

Why would I withhold this info from my friend? When I need him to get subs, he'll give me dope or pills and assure me that he'll get subs then often fail to get them. Last time I needed him to get subs he lied about being in contact with someone who had subs and never got subs when I needed. In times of the past, I've had WD from fent laced dope and had to suffer through work so it's important that I get subs when I ask for them and am willing to pay for them.

I've shared subs with my friend before but this time around I wanted to have something that he wasn't aware of so that I'd have it on deck when I would otherwise be in a bind. As a result, I now have a half a sub left when I otherwise would've been dope sick at work on a cold day.

&nbsp;

So now, when I deliver her laptop I still gotta be nice because she may be my only easy sub connect. I'll pay cash so she can't hold it over me. I'll also carefully explain to her how she's an asshole for saying that she helped me get a sub when I needed it in front of her brother when she knows damn well that I didn't share it with him while he was under the weather.

&nbsp;

For the work I've done I should get multiple free subs from her for fuck sake. She likely bought it up in front of her brother get me to hustle since she was putting me in a bad and awkward spot. I was forced to explain it away in some busllshit way which I managed to do effectively.

&nbsp;

Once I give her this workign replacment laptop tonight she better shut the fuck up. I'm also installing the same OS to a spare hard drive in case the hard drive currently in that laptop stops working. Why would it stop working? The other day when she pissed me off I dropped the laptop and side-kicked it in my frustration right after she left the room. So I expect the HDD to be unreliable and possibly to stop working. The plan is to be prepared to swap in a working replacement immediately after she calls me when it stops working. This'll allow me to expend the most minimal effort when that time comes.",1510693861.0

I think that this question is born of the type of thinking that keeps people away from treatment...i will explain:

If addiction is a medical issue (I don't believe it is a disease, but I do believe that the only real way to deal with opiate addiction is medically), then why is it so scandalous to bring ones children to the clinic?  We would never say it was inappropriate to bring a child to the urgent care with us if we have a sore throat.  The fact that we feel this way doesn't bode well for the future of treatment in this country.

Take it a step further:  how many people avoid the methadone clinic (which, along with suboxone/subutex, is the gold standard in opiate dependence treatment these days, much more effective than fancy rehab or 12 step programs) because it makes them look like ""a junkie""?  I suspect that is why so many people avoid treatment for so long...as long as your addiction is a secret, you never have to face it yourself.  This attitude will kill several people in the US today, and will kill hundreds this year.  

We need to drop all the stigmas.  Sure, there are people who are former or current criminals at the clinic, but would they be criminals if the drug war was ended?  If their drug was available to them in a clean, supervised place, and at a non-prohibition inflated price?  The vast majority would breathe a sigh of relief that they could now get this drug without fear of violence and poisoning at the hands of black marketeers, and then, most importantly, find legitimate work.  This is not theory.  It's what has happened in Portugal.  It's happened in Switzerland and the UK.  It's about to happen in Canada.  

It can happen here.  We just need to be vocal, and not waste any time or energy fighting each other, claiming that I ""may be in the methadone program, but I'm one of the GOOD ONES"".  Fuck that.  We deserve to have health and happiness like any other American.  ",1510683344.0

I figure there's no better person to ask than users themselves.

I recently started staying with a family friend to take care of him. This guy let a couple of people stay the night a few months back and they never left, they offered to pay him $100 a month per person for rent if he would let them crash on his floor. Since I've been here only one person has paid anything towards rent and it was only $30. He makes $700 on social security though he's not disabled, he's just a heavy amphet user and he's only 29 years old. Last month the disabled home owner called him on his shit and told him that he knew he was doing meth and that rent came before his drugs or he would be out on the 1st. The first came & went and he paid $30 in rent and the rest of his money went to pay a methamphetamine debt that he accrued during the month. These two individuals don't work, they constantly rob, lie, & steal. They scream and fight 24/7 and it's over the smallest most petty shit. I caught them in the shower getting busy and they were screaming & fighting while fucking each other, I don't understand it. I can't bring my son here out of fear that these people are going to bring down legal hell on this house. Another family member lives here and her young daughter sleeps in the same room that these people crash in and they're up all day & night screaming at each other in front of her and they're exposing her to things she should never be exposed to. We have all told them to get out by xXxX date and when that day comes they always have some shirty excuse about how they're waiting on their ride to get here or ""we're getting our apartment next week and we'll be out."" But next week never comes. I have helped pack their items and taken them to the porch, but they always play this mentally disabled individual and make him feel so bad that he stays up crying at night. I've confronted them about their use and actions but they refuse to listen. They both actively and regularly lie about their use (DAILY) and tell us that they're not using while they can't sit still, they're talking so goddamn fast that they choke themselves up, and it's beyond obvious that they're using. I put my foot down and told them this shit doesn't happen here anymore, if they're going to use they can do it elsewhere as they're endangering everyone in this house and opening them up to legal repercussions. The police are very aware of who they are as one is being investigated for robbing a restaurant on Halloween. I work 2 jobs and I have a son that I can't bring here because of their use & behavior. Every night we are all awoken by them screaming at each other in front of our rooms (or walking in our rooms) and turning the lights on and off like a goddamn light show. It's like experiencing night time & day time 100 times an hour. These people weasel their ways back in by playing the disabled home owner and he's so sick of them, along with everyone else, that it's affecting his physical health and has put him in the hospital for chest pains & anxiety. Calling the police to evict them is less than ideal as we have no idea what they've hidden or what they've done, they would no doubt try to pin their drugs/contraband on someone else. 

How do we go about getting them out when they're horribly manipulative and refuse to go willingly or with help.

TL;DR I need an Amphetamine users perspective on how to deal with 2 users who refuse to work, lie, steal, and bum off of everyone they meet. They scream & fight every minute that they're awake and it's affecting the household & the children. They're extremely toxic & refuse to leave or even try to help out.

For me it was those old Oxycontin pills that you could just straight up smash up and snort. I think it was a 15 if that's a thing? Only ever done oxy a couple times but I'm nearly certain it was 15mg pills. 

Sat in my front room, crushed up two and split them into lines with a mate of mine (who funnily enough was trying DMT for the first time). I remember being particularly careful as I was worried about overdosing and had been told it was common to spew the first time on opis. 

I still remember that first ever buzz coming on, it was nice and mellow and I just felt fucking fantastic, not a care in the world, watching this dude have his mind blown to pieces by the DMT. 

After that I walk him into town to get his bus and he looks like he's been skullfucked by a freight train. 

All in all a decent time and thankfully wasn't sick!

I was mentioning how much i love Percocet. and my boyfriend asked “what’s percocet?” i was...SHOCKED and FLABBERGASTED !!,"i asked how on earth had he never learned about one of the greatest drugs on this earth. He said he “couldn’t see the appeal” when i tried to explain it to him. Granted he’s very straight edge, has never even touched a cigarette. 

Anyway, i’m clean now and my poison was heroin, but something about perc will always have a special place in my heart. I think it’s because that was the first drug i ever “had”. 

I was like 14? And i had just gotten 2 wisdom teeth removed and because i had shitty insurance at the time it would not pay for anesthesia so i had to be very painfully awake while they pulled my teeth and i remember feeling the nerves being pulled from my jaw and wondering why it felt like sandpaper. Anyway, the doctor felt real bad about that so he prescribed me a BUNCH of percocet i’m honestly surprised the pharmacy let the order go through. (Then again, this was 9 years ago) 

I remember coming home and my jaw hurt so bad, the doctor said i could take 2 at a time. The strongest thing i had ever fucked with was extra strength Excedrin so this really was a shock. 

After they hit me, i remember thinking “wow, so **this** is drugs? Cool, i want to be doing that *always*.” That was the greatest 2 weeks of my life, then they all ran out 😔. I only got to do them once or twice a year when i, or a family member got hurt, or a friend would spot me. Fast forward 7 years later someone tells me that there’s stuff that’s *stronger than that*. I was like “Absolutely, hell fuckin yeah, sign me right on up.”

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I'm a finance major in one of the top 10 undergraduate business programs in the country (not trying to brag, just trying to set the stage for how out-of-place this was) and I had an absolutely BRILLIANT idea today.  Since I had an exam, I decided that I would mix the last of my dope into a large shot and bring it with me to the business school building where my class was, and boot up in the bathroom beforehand.  I've never shot up in a school building (and never will again) and I had just finished lifting, so I was wearing a pair of old sweatpants.  I walk into the building, and about halfway to my class I put my hand in my pocket and realize the rig I loaded is not there.  I check the other pocket in bewilderment, but it's not there either, and I'm SURE I put it in my pocket.

I presently break out in a cold sweat as I feel a small hole in the pocket of my pants, and realize that somewhere on the 5 minute walk from the parking garage, past the campus police station, and into the business school, I have shedded a syringe loaded with what is unmistakably heroin.  Of course I turn around and begin to retrace my steps.

At this point, I feel it is necessary to point out that the building which houses our business school is one of the newest buildings on our campus, and is basically where my school pours most of its money.  To set the scene, we're talking marble floors in a huge atrium with a giant statue of one of the famous politicians who attended the school standing in the middle.  In short, this is not the type of place where you find drug paraphernalia.  Yet as I'm retracing my steps, I spot the orange cap to my loaded syringe sitting just inside the doors of the main entrance to the building.  I'm immediately struck by extremely conflicting emotions: on the one hand I am happy/relieved to have found it so fast, and I know it must have only been sitting there for a minute or so.  On the other hand, I realize that if I can see this loaded syringe sitting DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE of this nice marble floor from 50 feet away, just about anyone else can too.

It is here I know that Junkie Jesus was looking out for me, because despite this rig falling somewhere it could not possibly have been more visible, which also happens to be the area of the business school which sees the most foot traffic, not a single soul walked through those doors between the time when I dropped it and when I saw it.  I mean, it could not have been any more obvious.  There is a desk where a receptionist sits just inside the doors to direct visitors and help people, and had she been sitting at her desk, this rig would have been in the middle of her field of vision.  But mercifully, nobody saw it.

As I walked over towards it, I actually debated (for all of 3 seconds) whether I needed to just leave it, because I was worried someone HAD seen it, and was simply waiting to see who would come back to pick it up.  But then I realized 1. This is the last of my dope and I am not leaving this super-dank shot sitting on the floor, and 2. There will be a fucking shitstorm if someone comes and finds this thing sitting there.  Thinking fast, I went and picked it up, and then went outside, reached into my bag, and threw out a used rig I had in my backpack as discretely as possible, so that if someone actually was looking, I would look like someone who found a loaded syringe on the ground and decided to do the good thing and throw it out.

From there, i quickly went into the bathroom, did my shot (was slightly ruined by the fear the cops were going to swoop in at any moment), and then threw out every stitch of paraphernalia I had with me or on me.  I am never bringing anything with me on campus again.

Job is going terrific. 3 places want me to work for them right now because of what I can do. My arm is infected right now from being in the ocean w a cut and I guess I got some bacteria in it, so I took the day off work. I got SO MUCH accomplished. I was just writing in my diary how good everything is going and how good it feels to get so much accomplished in one day. So many little errands that I’ve been meaning to take care of. Back when I was junkin’, even if I made a fucking phone call that I had been meaning to make, I felt accomplished. Was thinking to myself how nice tomorrow will be now that I got all of this shit done and I can just chill all day and watch movies and whatever. 

So job going good. No drugs for 6 months (yay). Getting stuff done in life. Been working out like a motherfucker and feel fit as fuck. Looking really good. My best friend today also just asked me to be his best man at his wedding, something I never thought anyone would want me to do...

Also- been banging this HOT AS FUCKING FUCK girl lately... I showed one of my buddies a pic of her and he didn’t even believe I could get a girl like that. He thought I was lying. Kinda felt good man. Anyway, girl wanted me to get an std check. Now, I honestly don’t have that much sex with different people and I was just checked (clean) last year, so STD check wasn’t super high on my priorities... I’m not showing any symptoms or anything. The girl just wanted us both to get checked so we could bang without condoms. So, getting checked was not even on my fucking radar until she brought it up the other day...I was just gonna do it more as a courtesy to her than anything else. 

So I’m out doing my errands. Finish the last thing I wanted to do that day. It’s late in the afternoon and I happen to be like directly across the parking lot from the clinic and I think “fuck it, one last thing for today then I’m going home”.  

I walk in. It’s a free clinic. I just checked the boxes of the shit I wanted to get checked for and waited a couple minutes until they called me back. Pissed if a cup. Pricked my finger for blood. As we were waiting for the “instant” blood test thing to show a result I did more paperwork. As we were doing paperwork I saw the nurse guy glance at one of the strips that had blood on it and I noticed his demeanor change a little bit. He was kind of stern when I first walked in. Very terse and short. I was probably his last person for the day as it was almost 5 and he probably just wanted to get the fuck out of there. After he glanced at the strip his voice softened. His eyes became kinder. He said nothing and continued with questioning for his paper work. I dismissed it as me being paranoid. In a couple seconds he was gonna tell me that I was all good and send me on my way....

After the paperwork was done he looked at me and said “ok...let’s talk about your results”

Me “...k”

Him “so this strip is for HIV....you are negative”

Me “praise Jesus”

Him “this other test is for hep C....”

Me “....”

Him “i have some news for you...you are positive for hep C”

I was waiting for him to smile and tell me he was fucking with me and that I’m good and free to go. He didn’t. 

Fuck. 

God fucking damnit. Are you fucking kidding me?

He says there’s a 20% chance it was a false positive and they would have to draw actual blood instead of doing finger prick to know for sure but since my veins are totally fucked they were unable to do it. I’m gonna have to pound water and go for a run then go in tomorrow to have blood drawn to know for sure. 

You guys are the first to know. I haven’t even told my mom yet. I’m extremely upset about all of this.

So there I was, fantasizing about how great it’s gonna feel to get ALL my errands done and actually be able to chill on my days off instead of running around doing shit... and now I gotta go give them blood and probably get treated for hep fucking C. Not to mention break the news to this girl. 

I just can’t believe it. I mean, I even went and got a fucking flu shot today just because that’s the type of shit normal adults do! I mean, FUCK!

Fuck me, fam. 

Ain’t that some shit? 

As always, thanks for reading. 

Also- let this be a fucking lesson for everyone out there. Even after you get clean as fuck and you have your life back together... the life still has a way of catching up to you. One way or another, the piper gets paid. ",1510805375.0

I have transverse Myelitis ( similar to MS ) and I am in pain throughout the day. I've tried everything and the only thing that seems to help is weed, fenatyl patches, and oxycodone. I was using the patches but the price for them got out of hand, 400-500$ for a months worth of patches (tf?). Oxycodone is cheaper and I am able to go throughout my day unlike weed which I only use when I am going to sleep. I was told to go to Pain Management to get my script back but I'm unsure on if I'll get the amount I was getting. I'm a female, 4'11"", and weigh around 81 pounds. I haven't had insurance in a while and I've just got it back again so I've mainly been relying on Kratom for a whole year. I've tried to use mainly Kratom but I've gotten fired from three different jobs solely because they would no let me sit and I would be in tears crying because the pain would get bad. Not to mention I have to wear a diaper my whole life because this disease messed up my bladder and I'm only 22. I went to a general practice doctor a week before and he's known not to give any pain pills but he was understanding of my pain and didn't give much but gave me ten 10mg oxycontin. I'm worried about pain management mainly because of my age, height, and weight so they wouldn't give me any or even close to my script. I also went to the ER a month before and they even gave me a script for 12 10 MG Oxycodone ( which again they never give pain pills but still was understanding of my situation ). I thought my tolerance would go down but because of the Kratom, one or two did nothing for my pain. I could take 3-4 10 MG Oxycodone and it would manage to bring my pain down to where I can function a bit normally. I honestly don't know what to do, I still live with my grandparents and they want me to get another job but it's too hard so I'm unsure on if going to Pain Management will even be beneficial. Not to mention, because I smoke weed, they would probably turn me down because I live in Georgia and weed is illegal here unless you have a medicinal marijuana card but even if you do have it, you can only carry CBD oil with 5% THC. Does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone tell me how a first appointment with PM will go? Worrying about all of this especially when I'm only 22 is just too stressful and I honestly wish I could just have my disease cured and never go to a doctor again. Sorry for the rambling, but anyways thanks for any help!

EDIT- Its funny because of a few things I mentioned all of a sudden people think im rolling in thousands of dollars of cash so let me clarify, firstly I went to a saudi arabian rehab center thats literally a fucking ""jail rehab"" if you can call it that and stayed there for 30 days. Yes I live in a house with maids but please please please dont assume I have thousands in CASH in my wallet, I had to sell my phone to get money to buy dope. Maybe I did not explain it well enough my situation at home is so unbelievably strict, extremely controlling that it feels like my self freedom is taken away, im literally in jail at home, FYI i am not allowed to close the bathroom door. I cant make a step or move if my mom is not home without calling my mom and letting her know, all phone records are looked at, all money is accounted for.. think about collecting money here and there over a months time to go buy? forget about it because EVERY SINGLE DROP OF CASH is accounted for. and ya those two maids alot of you keep mentioning are basically my moms general and lieutenant they watch my every move, not even a fart is made without my moms knowledge. I honestly dont understand the hate I have received just because my mom has two house maids, just like you I slept in the back of a shitty car. This lifestyle at home has drained me, and has made me nothing but a soulless human being. I came here looking for help because I have no one to talk to and everything is bottled up but it seems some people have envied me instead.

EDIT2- I did not steal or sell anything of my moms",1510801049.0

But then I always stop myself. Because I remember what it was like to listen to that kind of bullshit.

More specifically, I remember how I felt when I was still using, and would stumble upon some insufferable blow-hard touting his new sober life, urging me into the light with his own personal brand of aggressive positivity. Somewhere up there, I’d imagine, high upon his towering soapbox, there were an abundance of good intentions. And I guess to be drunk on sobriety is better than the alternative. But, personally, I’ll pass on that lecture. Good for you, high-five, two thumbs up.

Fuck, man. I knew my life was shit. I knew there was a better way to do it. You didn’t exactly need to be an enlightened yogi to tell me that.

Regardless, whether I was reluctantly squatted in a metal chair at a 12-step meeting or browsing r/opiates (or, god forbid… r/opiatesrecovery) this kind of method in egging people toward recovery did not sit right with me, and still to this day, does not. 

So, rather than go from the familiar bad life / good life dichotomy I’d rather attack this a different way, and merely bring to light a certain concept I learned through my struggles. One that I would never have had the luck of learning without suffering through my addiction to opiates. And my hope is that it can help someone regardless of whether they are trying to quit or not.

Long before my addiction, and even before I had even used any drugs at all, I was a sophomore in high school sitting in spanish class. I was lucky enough to have one of the coolest teachers around, Mr. Durazo. From students to staff, everybody loved Mr. D. 

He had a very sly talent of bestowing some solid life advice on his students. And in retrospect, his main goal may not have been to teach us Spanish but to prepare us for real life. Anyway, one day the topic of drugs came up in class. There was a recent weed bust at the school, and a several kids got expelled. It was such a hot topic at the time that no teachers were even attempting to graze the subject with a 10 ft. pole. But not Mr. D, he took it head on and had an encouraged open discussion about it. 

Sooner or later the topic delved into harder drugs, and before long, heroin came up. I am going to paraphrase here because it was a long time ago, but he said something to the extent of: 

“Yes, of course, there’s all the standard reasons to not use a drug like heroin, like overdose, needles, health reasons, etc. But, in addition to all of that, I’d imagine it would also leave somewhat of a... ‘longing,’ if you will. Like a hole that could never be filled again. That is to say, I’d be worried that the experience would be so good and so pleasurable that no other future life experience could even compare. Just think about it! It’s not like your brain would just forget how heroin felt! Every single fun, happy, or pleasurable experience thereafter might only be judged in comparison to that one amazing time I did heroin, and thereby making that experience relatively less enjoyable.”

Pretty god damn insightful for a person who has presumably never used heroin before.

At the time, I remember not thinking too much into it. I had hardly started getting into pot at that point in my life so my opinions about drugs weren’t a priority. I don’t know why it even stuck with me after all these years. So, I didn’t really give it much thought, but I understood what he meant.

Basically, this kind of suff:

“Wow, that sex was great… well...I mean, it wasn’t like heroin great, but it was still good.” 

“What an amazing hike that was, look at the view! What an experience! Ya, not a heroin experience, but still great!”

“This movie is pretty enjoyable, it would be better with a side of opiates though.”

“Man! What a relaxing shower after a hard day’s work, ahhh nothing could make this any better, well… aside from heroin.”

I think you get the picture. Mr. D was looking at repercussions a different way. In essence, he expected there to be an asterisk next to everything good that happened afterwards, denoting, “Well, not as good as heroin.”

At the time, I did think he had a good point, but I didn’t think he was entirely correct. I thought someone who tried heroin could probably compartmentalize each life experience afterwards and judge each experience on it’s own merit rather that how it fared compared to heroin.

Only problem there was that I was wrong.

It absolutely can diminish some of my more relaxing or pleasurable activities I do today. For example, maybe after a tough day laying in bed the idea creeps in “this would be way better opiated.” Or the glow after sex, “this is kind of like a heroin rush, but heroin would last way longer.” 

Before I proceed, I just want to be clear that these are very minute, fleeting, subconscious feelings of “it could be better.” They aren't actually thoughts that I’m saying to myself in my head. That would make it more like a craving. I can’t express enough how different this is from a craving. There’s no emotion or urges tied to it.

A long time ago, I watched a CNN documentary about a guy was about to die from a heart complication. He had only a matter of hours or days left. Then one doctor came out of nowhere and was willing to do an experimental surgery on him, and it ended up saving his life. The guy said he went into that surgery expecting he was never going to wake up. And then when he did wake up and realized he was going to survive, it was the happiest and most exhilarating moment of his entire life--which means a lot coming from a 70 year old.

When I saw this I was like, “Damn, I get that feeling several times per week. Sitting in my car, hardcore withdrawing, desperate, panicking. Literally feeling like I’m going to die. Then I get the “come thru” text and I am on top of the fucking world.”

Whether it’s that or simply shooting up, that kind of euphoric exhilaration is absolutely unparalleled. I have yet to find a thing, person, place or thing that can instantaneously have me believing that all my problems were gone and I was on top of the world like these kind of instances did. That kind of instant gratification just doesn't exist outside of chemical manipulation of your neurotransmitters, in my personal experience at least. 

I sometimes do miss those times. But I am glad they’re gone, because with the highs come the lows. But, funny enough, the lows in my addiction are what help me the most now.

Which brings me to the flipside of this concept--in the same way that my addiction has been able to make certain things comparatively less enjoyable, it has, to an ever greater extent, made almost everything in my life comparatively less worrisome, troublesome, and unpleasant. This has helped improve my life drastically. I’m more comfortable in my skin, more confident, less fearful and anxious.

It’s hard for anything to really phase me like it would have before my addiction. Anything, and I mean anything, I might have to struggle though today is exponentially easier in comparison than the shit I had to endure in the worst of my addiction. 

Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain? Meh, I'll suck it up and get it done, no biggie. 
Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain… in withdrawal?! Fuck. That. Noise. 

Have to walk down the street to get the mail? Minor inconvenience, possibly even enjoyable.
Have to walk down the street to get the mail, while you know there’s people out there looking to fuck you up because you haven’t paid them back yet? Ah, yeah, i’ll wait ‘till it’s dark. 

Get pulled over by a cop for busted tail light? Whatever, take the fixit ticket. 
Get pulled over by a cop for a busted taillight, with a quarter ounce of freshly copped dope under your seat.? Time to start panicking.

These are just a few easier examples. This idea even extends to things that don’t have a direct situational comparison.

Boss yelling at me for something I had no part in? The world will not end. It won’t even ruin my day now.

Loosing my job? That would freak me out before, that shit wouldn’t even affect my sleep now. I lost more jobs in my addiction than I can count. And if I got through it then, I can definitely get through it now.

Can't pay rent because my shity minimum wage job is cutting hours? Eh, not ideal, but I can handle it. I’ll crash at my sister’s or just sleep comfortably in my car for a bit. Nothing too bad. What’s bad is living on the streets in the winter with no money, dealing with cops, having to steal to get drugs, having to look over my shoulder.

The ups and downs I went through in my addiction have had the unintended effect of centering me, insofar as the relatively minor ups and downs of my life today seem so god damn insignificant. And if you've never felt that way before, let me tell you, that feeling is empowering as fuck! I feel more like a rock now and less like a feather. I feel more solid, my emotions are not subject to whichever way the wind blows.

So all in all, there are some negative consequences from my drug use that have persisted, but they are far outweighed by the positives I’ve taken away. There was a point in my life, when I was living in a small walk-in closet of a trap house, in withdrawal, out of money, no health insurance, freezing cold, fleas everywhere, trying to sleep and failing, anxious, desperate, and demoralized. I had lost everyone who ever cared about me, no one would talk to me anymore. When I felt beyond lost, at an impasse, with only one more option available. For the first time in my life, I thought to myself, “Being dead wouldn’t be so bad.” 

When it comes down to it, fear is useful for us as humans because it helps keeps us alive. But what if we no longer want to be alive, what then? Well, then fear loses its main purpose, and it feels a bit lighter. I felt comfort in that. Looking back, it was in this moment that I learned fear was more a condition of perception rather than something intrinsic. It was optional. And nothing but going to the deepest, darkest place would have been able to show me that. 

No longer in my addiction, there is no outside circumstance in the universe that could make me feel the way I felt that night. All of life's problems seem so insignificant in comparison to the time that was so bad that death was a better alternative to living. There is no person, no situation, no circumstance today that could rival the utter hopelessness of what I felt that night. And the fact that I survived that makes me feel like I can survive anything.

You are the only one that can decide if your life will be better without opiates. I’m not here to tell you my life was bad, now it is good, and you're stupid if you don't live the way I do. I just wanted to share with you something I learned along the way, something that has had a positive impact on my life. And the cool part is that it’s just a perspective--not a program, or a step, or a self-help booklet. Just a different way of looking at the struggles you may be going through. It doesn't have to be that you are broken because of what you've been through, it can be that you  are stronger because of it.

Strong swords are forged in fire. Keep that in mind.

But it got me noddin so fast (with a heavy tolerance to dark here) and I instantly fell in love. I know you're all thinking fent.

Smoking it gave such a rush and instantly felt a warm blanket surround me, after time of smoking it wouldn't effect the same so I smoked/snorted but once a few days off of it smoking would give a similar first time experience. Unlike fent, the withdrawls do not come until around 24 hours. Do they say white China on the east coast isn't smoke able because people just don't do that or does it literally not burn/cause smoke? Lately I've been hearing about down the boarder they have been making white, and slowly it's getting around the west coast... Could this just be some complete different kind of white they made that is smokeable? Basically I want to know what I got, so I can know what I'm looking for.

I'd vowed to never do one without the other, but I fail that every time I try to quit opiates but that combination is a total match made in heaven. 

What confuses me though is the sheer contrast of it all. For example, I distinctly remember trying, buying and then smoking a new brand of cigarettes (idk if you guys have Winston Blues there)  that seemed really good while I was all fucked up on Oxy, but the next day all out of drugs I had a puff on one of my final Winstons and it was fucking gross. I ended up giving the rest of them away for a single Marlboro, I couldn't bear the taste of them. 

This has been something that's happened to me many times. Don't get me wrong either, I am not at all a picky smoker - I'm not one of these ""I only exclusively smoke Lucky Strike and will go through nicotine withdrawals before taking a puff of anything else"" assholes. On heroin, good cigarettes & tobacco tastes like the pussy of the holy spirit, and even awful tobacco & cigs will taste fine. 

So it's not just the fact that they feel better or that the nicotine buzz is enhanced and has a lovely synergy with opiates - although by god that is all correct - but its honestly as if the actual physical taste of the things change. It's weird because IME for everything else my sense of taste is slightly dulled on opiates, but the taste of cigarettes changes radically for the better.

Save all of the ""don't do it"" responses I have tried several (pharmaceutical) opiates before but would still consider myself ""opiate naive"". As far as becoming addicted goes I don't think it will be an issue for me. I know how dumb this sounds. I say that because in the past when I dabbled with oxy I would purchase 100 at a time and do them daily until they were gone without any desire to purchase more. The only notable WD symptoms I would experience are a couple sleepless nights and some irritability. It has been about a year since Ive have done any opiates and I would like to try something different this time. Any opinions or advice from experienced users would be greatly appreciated.

It has been gruelling, exhilarating, rewarding, punishing and not as big a deal as people would have you believe. I just need to get some shit off my chest and whose collective shoulder to cry on could be better than my fellow rejects' ? I'm hoping to demystify the billion-dollar industry that is recovery with this post, and who knows some of you might get inspired to turn your lives around or at least try (because Lord do I know that my shit is far from fixed).


First thing I noticed is that the key to sober life is basically dividing your day into little segments, carefully balancing responsibilities and leisure time. It doesn't have to be rocket surgery, you're in recovery so treat yourself to whatever hobbies you'd like to indulge in. Don't overburden yourself with a million goals, like losing weight, getting swole, fixing your legal and financial shit all at the same time. It's paramount to happiness that you set attainable goals (fucking Anthony Robbins over here, I know). I just read a bunch, listen to lots of music and watch lots of TV. I socialize at work, do some online dating and that's that. It's hilariously uncomplicated in comparison to shooting dope and coke daily, but this leads us to the next lesson.


Life is gonna get boring. How could it not be? There simply are no better feelings than shooting hard drugs. So you really need to come to terms with the fact that you'll never get the same peaks of unadulterated euphoria again. This pissed me off to no end at first, but after a while, I settled in. The highs may not be as intense, but they're more sustainable. I love reading, and no it will never get me as happy as a shot of good coke, but it won't break me as a person as much either, not by a long shot. So you need to visualize how a mediocre, content life (by junkie standards of course) can be made appealing to you.


And finally. FUCK COCAINE. If you have a coke habit as well as a heroin habit, I got good and bad news for you. First, you won't crave dope as much as you're afraid you might. However, the coke cravings are *real*. Every now and then, I'm overwhelmed by the immense need for a bellringer. Some trivial things which triggered this feeling:

- the vague smell of fuel
- bouts of nausea
- glass tubes
- any white powder period
- ringing/pressure in my ears

All this shit takes me back to last year: sitting on my bed, geeking so hard I'm unable to move, breathing hard, my heart about to give out, vomiting and loading a new shot of girl every ten minutes. Oh I'm still suffering the consequences: my veins are fucked. I never had a problem finding places to hit until I started fucking with coke.


So yeah, fuck cocaine. It's the real devil to beat, at least for me.",1510782692.0

I'm currently almost 6 months sober living in a recovery house. I was using heroin everyday for a few months (sniffed) and got up to about 1-1.5 g's daily because I didn't do anything but use. I didn't work (stole to fund habit) didn't go out just simply sat and used. I have a job right now, 50 hrs week as a cook and about to get a raise so I'd be getting close to 500/week. I'm really bored all the time, I have found some comfort in AA but i feel like it's not enough. Now maybe that's just my brain saying it would like endorphins and that I shouldn't be living a regular life, but i just don't see myself staying clean long term. Not because I can't do it, but because I just don't enjoy it especially once I move out of my recovery house and have a lot more responsibilities and bills.

 I have been talking to my old plug because I really want to use, but I've been torn due to my newfound stability and my family talking to me and stuff is nice. That's really it though. My plan would be to use every once in a while(I don't get drug tested so I'd just have to get high at night when no one would notice in my room) so like once a week or so. I have two back up plans in case I do get caught which would be to go to a detox for 2 days and come back to recovery house (house rules, not an Oxford house) or to move in with my plug who said I can if I have to. The rent at his place would be 350$ a month which is nothing and it would be easy to pick up lol. Anyway that's all the info. What should I do?

Tl:Dr - thinking of relapsing (would only chip) I have two backup plans to go to detox for 2 days and come back to recovery house (house rules) or to move in with plug which he said I could do for 350$/month. What do?

I got 7 more hours before I refill my script (90 Oxy or 10 mg & 30 oxycontin 10 mg). I know that's low dose to many of you, but I am fairly new PM patient who's learning to jump through all these hoops. However, I do know the path to become an opiate Rx'd PM patient. It took me a full year working with a PCP, physical therapy, orthopedic spine specialist, spinal neurologist, and all the xrays, MRIs, and CTs they put me through. This went on for just over a year before I was referred do PM so I know what it's like to need opiates for pain relief and to do what it takes to get them today.

 Aside from the social stigma, There was so much about her DAILY struggle and routine that made her feel completely alone and ostracized. As can be expected, I've been thinking about her a lot in the past few days. I guess my question is: what about your own story--and I mean anything-- with opis would make you feel less lonely and alienated if you saw it reflected back in someone else's story?

Post an ad on casual encounters and say you're a woman looking for a man (w4m) because a guy most likely isn't going to help another guy get their hands on anything. In your post simply say that you ""need H elp finding some party favors etc...."" Just use that as a base and type whatever else you think might work. Within 5 min I had over 15 people emailing me trying to help. The first thing I replied is ""sorry but im actually a guy but do you think you could still help?"" A lot of them didn't even reply after that because they were just trying to use the desperation of people to get laid but there's always that solid reply that looks promising. Work a little magic and make people trust you and eventually one of those people replying will come through. I met a really cool and normal ass white dude with all the goodies 5 min down the road at a Whataburger and was on the way home within a few minutes. I wouldn't even attempt finding someone posting about selling something because 99% of those are just bad news. I've been trying to score on CL for a week now by trying to find ads posted by other people but none of that shit ever worked and its sketchy.

First five years i managed wihout opiates but then a second injury made me turn to opiates to help. Heroin worked, but when fentanyl came around got too dangerous. I also got infections and health problems from unclean street shit. 

I have mental problems, not interested in anti depressants. Not long ago i got ahold of not even a dozen dilaudid pills, a bunch of kratom, and some liquid methadone. I would switch between maintaining on methadone and kratom and once a week when my pain got real bad, shoot a dilly. Would micron filter it and everything. But ive run out. The kratom and methadone keep me well, i take such a tiny amount, 6mg of methadone or like 15g of kratom a day. But the dillies were the best. Theyd wash away my intense sadness.... let me relax and feel less pain for a few hours.

Now im conaidering buying dnm heroin and micron filters and shooting that instead of dillies which i cant get. Im afraid of weird diseases and viruses that even a sterile micron cant filter out. Im paranoid some ISIS al queada taliban fuck is gonna chemical weaponize the junk, theres case reports of people in Vancouver getting strange brain infections from dope in the 2000s. Theres also been a case where they had cut it with bone meal and it gave junkies mad cow. 


I can try to see a pain specialist for some pharma shit... its probabaly unlikely ill get fuck all because i tried to get treatment for addiction awhile back, ots on my public record.so im fucked, im considering travelling overseas to a more liberal doctor if one exists. 

I dunno, any suggestions or anything? I cant see myself wanting to live life without a regular release that a strong fast acting opiate gives me. Its just too painful. Ive suffered alot. I wat to cry and scream sometimes because i feel like nobody will help me. 

Back to heroin? My source is good, its uncut and as pure as can be. I just hate the idea of putting non pharma drugs inside me.... i will probably order it and a milligram scale and try my best to keep it under control. We all know how that goes.

I also got extremely lucky that there was no fent in the dope cause this area is notorious for it. While we were waiting on the plug the dudes let me smoke some crack with them. I had never smoked crack before but it was definitely an experience lol. I can see why people fiend for that shit. Just wasnt for me.

Basically I was walking down to this gas station right by where i work to get a pack of cigs and some snacks. I saw this homeless dude who i see pretty often while walking to work and usually help him out with a cig or some change. He came asking for 1.25 for some beer. I was like you know where the dope is at? ""what you need"" etc etc. I told him and i offered to buy him $10 worth of crack as requested. Luckily his plug delivered so after getting some cash at CVS we chilled in a Pollo Tropical parking lot smoking crack and ripping cigs. The guy pulled up in about 20min which was wayy faster than expected. Everything went super smooth and a did a test bump of both bags and was very pleased. 

I was quite surprised at how well it worked out but i know im very lucky as a lot of shit can happen when cold copping. I was wondering if anyone had some good cold copping stories.",1510892923.0

Some taste like baking soda, some taste like cornstarch and some taste extremly bitter. 

I recently discovered the inactive ingredient section on drugs.com and I noticed this...

""Disintegrants facilitate the breakup of a tablet in the intestinal tract after oral administration. Cross-linking allows enhanced bioavailability of the drug through superior drug dissolution. Without a disintegrant, tablets may not dissolve appropriately and may effect the amount of active ingredient absorbed, thereby decreasing effectiveness.""

It's crazy to think that. 
But in this last year things have admittedly gotten worse once I ""graduated"" to dope.

But aside from my crippling mind state and chaotic home life, there's been one positive despite this all:
My career. 

It's strange to think that huh? 
How does a junkie keep excelling within their career path while descending into the darkness? 
Well..

I'm a cake decorator. 
I have a cool ass job and I'm good at it. I've never excelled so fast at something in my entire life

I'm a pastry chef and have been doing cakes for 5 years now.
Drawing and art is my specialty. It's the one GOOD gene my parents passed on 
(Makes up for all the other issues I get from them!)
And I find that I can channel the creativity through my cake decorating. 

In the last year alone I've gotten a vast raise, developed a name for myself and I'm now getting moved to a position in which I'll be working on the companies wedding cakes which is something I've DREAMT of. (We do cakes for some pretty big venues in the city I live in) 
Basically, it's a big deal and I developed pride in this 
(*hey I'm allowed to brag about this considering it's the only good thing I got going*) 
The bakery I work for is family owned and I feel as though I'm truly accepted as one of the kin. 
This place is more of a family to me then my actual family. 

This job is everything to me. It really is. 
And let me tell you, this industry..the culinary/restaurant/bakery industry is HARD af to manage working when your in active addiction, specifically when your withdrawing
(*the worst!!*)
There's been many times where I've thought I was so close to loosing this because I'm so heavily addicted to this damn substance and I can't function without it. 

So that being said..
My appreciation for this job and my work is becoming so important it's making sobriety more appealing each and every day. 
I can only imagine how much better I could be if I didn't have this monkey on my back.
I want to get clean and really focus on my talent, especially before heroin destroys my love for this 
(Literally one of my biggest fears...all my other hobbies are squashed) 
So like what the fuck am I waiting for?? 

Eh..it's just such a weird parallel ya know? 

That's all. 
Just wanted to share. 
And I hope I don't come off as cocky or anything? I just really genuinely love what I do and I realize how rare this is. 
They say if you do what you love for a living, you'll never work another day in your life. 

So Fuck you heroin..you are NOT taking this away from me!!!! 
 
Let me know if any of you guys can relate?

The occasional bend

Undoubtably though, we shall further descend

My lover has gone, she has sent me away

I look at the gun, though tempt me it may,

I’d rather battle the demons, that led me astray

My mission being harm reduction. I couldn't hide any more that I had switched from snorting to experimenting with shooting (for about a month).  My girl, somewhat understanding, I would share some H with her very occasion (helped her with that womanly monthly cramping).

Asked the pharmacist about Narcan.  He seemed confused and just didn't know the procedures to selling Narcan OTC. (The sheer lack of knowledge about this harm reduction to the lead pharmacy tech just shows how neglected addicts are on this side..) So, 10 minutes and several pages of reading, and 2 phone calls later he comes back with 2 small off-orange boxes, then proceeded to let me know that I had to buy 2 of them at a time, and sign some paperwork.  Each of them 2mg so 4mg total.  I'm wanting to keep one for emergencies.  Obviously...

Being how wonderful this community is, and how y'all have been there for me, I'm willing to ship this IV dose of Narcan to whomever needs it most...

ive been clean of all opiods (including kratom maintence) for about 2 weeks now, and had my 'final hit' yesterday-- the warm rush was nice sure, but the rest of the day spent unconscious and vomitting... i started drugs because i felt i was hardly living-- couped up in my room with little sources of pleasure/excitement/contentment.

now i realize opiates are the opposite of living, the escapism is seductive for sure-- but they dont make life better; they partially remove you from it; at least for a little while. Then the return to earth is a living hell, with every physical or emotional feeling like a kick in the teeth...

i think im done with this viscous cycle of one foot in one foot out of heroin addiction. part of me is very controlling and my runs never go on for more than a few months before i detox and start up again... its probably the most damaging usage pattern i can think of-- no stability whatsoever...

im ready to move on, after yesterdays binge i decided life has more to offer. Wish me well guys-- 'choose life' xD 

i plan on getting through the days on aderall, and some weed/hash in the evenings with valium used sparingly (for example i tapered off them over 10 days when i last quit, but just took one now as the anxiety of the thought of withdrawals returning was killing me-- fortunately i have 0 symptoms, 1 day didnt seem enough to set me back)",1510855930.0

Part of me is proud of not having pain meds for 3 weeks but I feel horrid.  I'm not happy, I feel like punching walls.  The days just seem to drag on and on.  
How long does it last?  The whole reason I started taking pain meds was to stop this pain and dread... I just feel lost.  I wait to sleep and wake up wishing the day was already over.
I'm sorry to be a bummer - but I wish I could find a balance of normal.",1510854176.0

I’m visiting a sick family member, so I’m away without my supplier for two weeks and I just ran out of what I brought with me.  11 days to go...

I have a few 30mg Morphine ER, but not enough and I’d like to just go ahead and face the detox anyway.

I have: 
weed
Xanax/Valium
Kratom (28 red maeng capsules, but I can order more)
Imodium 

and I already have some things from the Thomas Recipe: L-Tyrosine, multivitamins, vitamin B6, access to jacuzzi/hot bath, bananas. 

I’m about to do my last run to the grocery store (I’m in a small town, so limited resources) and going to get a lot of water, Pedilyte, ginger chews, dark chocolate…

I was basically going to try a combination of the Thomas Recipe and Kratom to combat the withdrawals.  Does that sound like a good plan?  

I can lay low for 5-6 days.

I’ve only detoxed once before - cold turkey, and it was such an awful experience so I really want to avoid as much of the awfulness as possible. The main reason I’ve still been on Oxy is because that detox was so rough.",1510853961.0

7ddjxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7ddjxb/bathroom_safety_question/,44,https://redd.it/7ddjxb,TheSnootchMangler,Bathroom Safety Question,"Hey y’all, I’ve got a question regarding bathrooms and needles and whatnot. I’d appreciate any feedback you can give. I work for a city government parks dept. We have an issue where the restrooms at one of our pools has become a homeless person magnet. The pool is open all year, does not charge an entry fee, and has individual rooms where you can lock yourself in and shower/get cleaned up. In hindsight, this was a bad idea. Homeless people frequently use these rooms as a place to shoot up, have sex, and smear shit all over the walls. One dude goes so far as to take the liner out of the trash can then shit in the trash can. I guess to make it more of a hassle for the staff cleaning it up. The lifeguards frequently find needles stuffed in the drains or hidden under the sink. This pool is also 100 feet from an elementary school. 

My questions are:

1.  What do you think would be the effect of installing sharps disposal containers in these rooms?  Will that signal we are cool with what’s going on and result in more people showing up to shoot up/blast shit on the walls?  

2. Does anyone have a suggestion for how to reduce the frequency of this undesirable behavior?  We’re about to just lock up the restrooms for good and make everyone use the other restrooms on site, which don’t provide any privacy/door locks. More of a locker room type situation. 

Anyway, happy nods and I’d appreciate any thoughts on this subject. 

Thank you. ",1510850123.0
