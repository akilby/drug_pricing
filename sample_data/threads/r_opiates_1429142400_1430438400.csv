This might not be a typical post for this sub but I decided to give it a try. My husband and I have taken a 15 yo foster daughter who will be 16 in 3 months into our home. She came about 5 weeks ago and as soon as she came she got sick. At first she suggested she has the flu but when we insisted on taking her to a physician she said she was in heroin withdrawal and refused to go. We let her sweat it out for 2 weeks and then she started going to school.

We immediately assumed that the kid was addicted due to the withdrawal, but we are not sure how mentally addicted she actually is. She told us she had been using for 5 months and addicted for 2 months before she came to us. She calls it addicted for the last 2 months because she got really bad physical symptoms when not taking it. Yet, if she didn't have a clean needle she didn't shoot up. If she was properly addicted, would a clean needle really have mattered?

I have recieved advice to lock the kid up and hide all medicines because she is an addict and will take anything she can to get high any opportunity she gets. I was told she is probably hiding pills in her room and that she might not be staying in the library after school to study after all, but could be out doing drugs. I searched through her room and found nothing, and my biological daughter who is in the same year says that our foster daughter does sit in the library after school. When we let her go to a party hosted by a senior boy last weekend we asked her not to drink (she wanted to, but said she it wasn't important and that she wouldn't if we didn't want her to) and when she got home I smelled her breath. I smelled no alcohol. 

Our foster daughter ran away from a group home and had been living on the streets for 2 years before we got her. She tells us she started using heroin because she wanted to die and figured she might as well get a couple of highs before the final overdose. However, she fell in love during this time and says the feeling of love gave her a reason to live. When her boyfriend turned 18, though, he was able to get a job and an apartment. He left her a note one morning saying he would turn his life around and then he was gone. She was heartbroken but decided she will also turn her life around. She submitted herself to the social services because she wanted to go back to school and needed somebody to sign the papers. 

I wonder if the kid's heroin addiction is more related to her circumstances than an actual desire to take the drug. She tells me that every day is painful because she hates waking up as herself, having her life, just being her. What she loved about heroin was that it made her feel good and made it so that nothing mattered. I ask her if she is tempted to take it again and she says that she doesn't want to go down that path and have that life back. She says this is her chance to finish high school and get a career. She knows what homeless is and however tempted she may be she has already made her choice to stay away from it, because that sort of life is painful. She says she has to wade through this pain and do her work for her life to turn out better in the long run. 

The kid is quite private but we are slowly getting to know her. She works incredibly hard and her room is always clean, her homework done the same day as it was assigned. She always offers to help cook or clean at home. She is very polite and seems afraid we will kick her out. Our biological kids age 13 and 11 get along really well with her. Since she has been living on the street for the past 2 years she had to start freshman year in high school and is the same year as our biological daughter. Our foster kid is 1-2 years older than her classmates and she is having a hard time relating to the other kids. She doesn't being any friends home. All she has really done socially is gone to that one party, which she said was alright.

We suggested she go to therapy but she doesn't want to. She is willing to go a couple of times anyway since we think it could be good for her, but asked for some time to settle down first. She is still busy catching up in school and getting to know us and making new friends. 

I am conflictee because I get advice to lock the kid up because she is addicted when the kid is making good choices and claiming she won't take any drugs. It seems to me she is doing fine although I recognize it is very painful and a lot of hard work for her every day. Does this kid seem addicted to you? What would you do to support her? She tells us that she likes keeping busy to keep her mind of the drug, and that she is very busy, so it really isn't that hard, but still hard.

Thanks so much for input on this from people who actually have experience with this drug and might know a thing or two about how multi-faceted I assume addiction can be.

I just don't get it, r/opiates.  There are times I post in this sub and get some really wonderful responses! Positive answers! Innovative outlooks! Insightful and power advice is something I can almost always find here. But it's 50/50.  I might write a comment, post a picture, or tell a story and it will either be received with joy, up-votes, and tons of positive replies OR it'll be the complete opposite. Negative commentary, unnecessary insults - and not just to me but to many other subscribers and commentors. 

I'm not saying everyone in this subreddit is like that, but it seems like when I come here to pour myself out anonymously and honestly about my drug-use I am either going to get one of 2 results:  Positivity or Negativity. Which one is /r/opiates going to be today? Are they going to like the story I wrote about a long weekend adventure? Or are they going to answer that user's question with honesty and compassion? Or are they going to nick pick and call people names and poke fun because they're using hydrocodone and not ECP. I just don't know how to please you /r/opiates! It seems you are just so finicky and I never know what you consider a decent post! I try to be honest and keep it witty and creative but I just don't know how it's going to be received until after it's posted.

/END RANT - I apologize for the bitching. It's just something I've wanted to get off my chest for some time now.  People praise this community as accepting and having a sense of family, but honestly when I come here and comment or write I feel like a total outsider.

Ill give you all a quick run down of how the months have progressed. I'm 19 y.o., I dab almost every day, and I do not drink alcohol. 

>**November**: Dislocated shoulder in November got *3 shots of fentanyl/midazolam* combo in the E.R. and prescribed *25* **10/325** *Norcos*

>**December**: Wisdom tooth removal prescribed *40* **5/325** *vicodin* and got *five 4mg Dilaudids* from a friend as well which i insufflated some days along with the Vicodin. This is when I started using the CWE method quite a bit.

>**January**: Started taking Suboxone regularly, around *2-3mg Buprenorphine twice weekly* i'd say for the majority of January. 
^(I know many people don't see the use of recreational subs, or advise against it, but personally i had a great experience)
>**February**: Cleaned up from opiates began using Benzos more:, averaged about *1mg four times per week* for the majority of february

>**March**: Surgery to restructure my shoulder socket. Received *60 Percocet* **10/325**, *40 Somas* **350mg Carisoprodol**, and *60 Norcos* **5/325**. At this point I had FOR SURE developed a strong psychological addiction, but little physical dependence. -sigh- now comes april..

>**April**: So far, since March 15th, I've gone through about 5 grams of BTH (black tar heroin). The progression was fast, vicious, and now has me by the scruff of the neck. I use about .2 per day average, and this is 6/7 days of the week. I've been able to force myself to take one full clean day (although I still smoke weed)

If you are on probation and get a motion to revoke warrent, will it show up when you search for warrants online? Or will they hide it so that they can arrest you the next time you come in, unsuspecting, for your next probation visit?

If you fail a UA, will they ALWAYS tell you that you've failed? Or will they sometimes tell you that you've passed so that they can arrest you when you come in, unsuspecting, for your next probation visit?

If you fail a UA, can they arrest you right there on the spot? Or do they need to get a warrant filed first? And send it off to the lab first? (I've heard they will only send it to the lab at your request/if they can't get you to admit you have been using?)

My girlfriend and i have been together about 8 months but weve known eachother for 7 years. We reconnected last summer and pretty much immediately moved in together. I knew she was a big drinker but im a decent drinker myself so i didnt really put much thought into it at the time.


Until she drank a bottle of vodka that my dad had been saving (i live with him and she moved in here) and lied about it, finally admitting that she drank it in a fit of anxiety about visiting her mother whom she has issues with.

Okay, thats kind of fucked but ive done stupid shit we talked it out, she apologized to my dad and talked with him about it. Alls well for awhile then i get a call from her while shes supposed to be at work saying they pulled her for a random drug test. Turns out it wasnt random and she had drank 1/3 of a liter of whiskey before work, she blew a .247 which i only know because i snooped through her stuff while she was asleep (because she cannot or will not talk to me about these things).

That was pretty rough but once again we talked it out and she told me that she has self-control issues, blah blah blah. I let her keep living here even though roughly once a month we would have an issue with her sneaking around drinking (which i asked her not to do because of the aforementioned and the fact that she was in work ordered drug counseling) and lying to me about it.

She has never been able to tell me why she sneaks around like she does, ive told her over and over that i just want her to be honest with me, that is the most important thing to me, and that we can work through this together.

So we keep having these issues, she keeps lying and i keep enabling by not throwing her ass out. Until tonite when i came home from a job i just started, im all excited we were gonna watch the new game of thrones, and shes plastered. She claims she didnt drink anything but shes visibly drunk. My dad said there were 5 beers when he left the house and when he came back 30 mins later there was 1. Because she slams the beers to make it look like she didnt drink much but she still gets a buzz. I know this because she told me she was taking a shower and i walked in to pee, she was sitting in the bathroom with 5 empty bottles around her.

So i kicked her out, in the middle of the nite, she took a cab most likely to her cousins house. I dont know what to do, ive wanted to marry this girl but tonite i came seriously close to hurting her out of sheer anger and frustration. While she was waiting for the cab i explained how everytime this happens it breaks my heart and thats why she has to go that she has made me feel used and awful on so many occasions that i cant let it go on. She cried and said she was sorry and i told her if she was really sorry she wouldnt do this to the next guy because it hurts and its a shitty thing to do to someone you claim to love.

And she left and im sitting here typing this thinking about how bad it sucks and how much i want her here to watch GoT and eat the dinner i made us. And i still really want to help her, i still love her, i loved her when we were friends and i loved her when we were lovers and i love her still now even though i kind of hate her.

So how can i help? What can i actually do to help her? I cant let her live here because i dont trust her but i want her to cope with this and be able to talk to SOMEBODY about it. Maybe down the line we could try again but right now i want her to get help and im the only one who knows how bad her problem is.

Im sorry this is kind of a jumbled mess but you guys understand im sure (thats why im here). Thanks for reading and any advice you can give.",1429156376.0

32qjhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/32qjhx/yet_another_overdose/,60,https://redd.it/32qjhx,FashionablyFake,Yet another overdose.,"I saw an old friend of mine today who sold me a bag for about half price for ""old times sake."" I was obviously psyched because I can very rarely get high. I didn't do a test shot because it was a pretty small bag, although I considered saving 2/3rds of it for later but I didn't because like I said, it was small. 

Well, I ended up falling out in his house. So they had to narcan me. I woke up on the floor with 5 strangers plus my friend all staring down at me. I felt like such an idiot and I'm pissed that I didn't save some of the bag because obviously it would have been enough for another shot later tonight. 

Here's the thing, though. I'm really glad that I didn't die in my friends house because that would have been fucking awful for him. But I've been incredibly depressed and suicidal for a few years now and part of me is disappointed that they brought me back. I sort of wish they hadn't. I would probably never *intentionally* kill myself, but I wish I could make some sort of ""do not resuscitate"" order for situations like today, with a waiver for whoever is with me so they won't get in trouble if I die in their house. 

So, I'm still alive and no longer high and I wasted a good opportunity and the last of my money. 

Sorry for the morbidity. It just drove home for me how utterly fucking hopeless I feel. ",1429136549.0

Last week a chick OD'd and now plain clothes is walking my streets?  Man...Look at those pigs over there.  Who the fuck walks around here dressed in khaki pants with a tucked in brand new A's t-shirt and baseball cap?  Shit.  This Giants territory asshole.

And the fucking college kids...man they so look like freaks and shit.  Guys wear makeup on their eyes, color their hair like cartoon girls.  All those spikes and leather what a joke!  They wear that look on the outside but have no guts on the inside.  Girls are OK though.  Dig that slutty black depressing look...Plus college students are money.  They get those student loans and rich parents to float that lifestyle.  So I'll go to their parties and their clubs.  I'll shake hands with the assholes and I will definitely take their money.  Everyone needs to eat.

I clock in at 3pm so I miss the morning rush but most of my clients are students so fuck it.  I'm 16 so I can do this a couple more years before I have to worry.  I don't carry a gun and never keep drugs on me.  I use the burrito bag method I got from Caesar.  Get a burrito, just beans and rice no salsa and take a few bites.  Shove the buns inside.  You get popped you shrug because you got no gun and who knows who left that burrito in my car Mr. Officer?

Caesar is the boss man.  We all listen to Caesar because that dude is 100% down.  He is always strapped and ready to go.  Wild stories about that fucker.  If only half of them are true it's best you stay on his happy side.  And only money makes Caesar happy.  

I'm one of the H dealers for our crew, other guys roll out the buds, we got X, coke and meth.  Caesar spends most of his time with the gambling side.  He is supposed to be on supervised release at his grandma's.  She lives above La Llorna - the bar where Caesar works.  Anytime a cop shows up he just goes upstairs to visit his abuelita.  

La Llorna is quiet.  Its a tiny, hole in the wall bar.  A hangout for gangsters but not a party one.  They watch TV and drink beer but nothing rowdy.  Caesar's grandma may be old but she still has good ears.  Caesar is checking out some rings, a necklace and a watch when I walk in.  The guy he is talking to nods and leaves as I approach.  Caesar slides the jewelry in his pocket and pushes the watch out to me.

""Take it man.  Maybe you'll learn to be on time"", smiles Caesar.

It was a solid silver watch.  Heavy and shiny.  I never saw anything like it.

""Damn!  You sure?"", I asked.

""Yeah man take it."", said Caesar.

""Thanks!""  

The watch feels solid and powerful on my wrist which has only known cheap rubber watches.  I have to remember to take it off at home though because I know what my dad will say if he sees it...  

Caesar slid over my quota in a magazine which I take without a word.  I was still staring at the watch.  I look up and he was studying me.

""Any problems or shit I should know about?"", he asks as he reclined back into his chair.

""Well that guy in the dorms keeps upping his orders.  Think I may give him a break if he pushes more for us on campus.  Oh and they want coke too.""

Caesar nods.  Coke was not my thing but I added 2 routes in a month and am pulling in good money from the college students.  Who knew those fuckers liked heroin so much?  They snort it so we have to turn our tar to powder which Caesar has started doing to keep up with demand.  

""How much coke?"", he asks.

""Same as the buns."" 

Caesar grunts and smiles.   ""This is a big order.  You keep pulling numbers like this and you will need your own little crew to help.  Anything else?  Who's not paying?""

""Well Uncle Santino..."", I began but Caesar shakes his head.  Uncle Santino owns a grocery store and runs the phonecard operation.  Caesar uses his market at night for card games and stores shit there. 

""Leave him.  Who else?""

""Just that college student Jason.  Never around."" 

""Let me tell you about people like that.  You gotta catch him with his friends because he doesn't give a fuck about himself.  He is too far into this thing to care about threats.  But if you kick his ass in front of his friends-someone will probably pay.""

""Alright.""

""You know what?"", smiled Caesar broadly.  ""You have a lot to do and don't have time for this.  I'll take care of it.  How much does that bitch owe me?""  ",1429117733.0

I used it for a few months half a year ago, but I just didn't like how I felt on them (12mg). The last 3 months I've been trying to kick dope, but every single time I made it a week or more (longest was 15 days) I relapsed. That happened about 4 times. I was detoxing at my parents, and very understandably, they couldn't deal with this shit anymore. 

I also tried to commit suicide by OD 2 times. One time I even checked into a hotel for a night. I wasn't in the mood for partying or doing crazy shit like people say you should if you have nothing to lose. I just grabbed a beer from the minibar, wrote a couple of letters as fast as I could, and slammed a half gram of decent dope with no tolerance. I woke up 4 hours later, just like as if I had been sleeping. I still wish I'd never woke up that day, but I guess I'll give life another chance.

Back to the subs. For me they're not just blocking heroin, but suicide as well ha. I don't have a gun (Europe) and I'm too scared to do it any other way than that or OD. So maybe I'm one of those who actually will benefit from it. But it doesn't feel like it.

There was this girl who used to run with my clique, she contracted hep c. When she learned this she not only decided to keep it a secret, but then the crazy bitch went miles out of her fucking way to infect her boyfriend;really tho, bitch went full on HAM with the sole purpose of giving her boyfriend (of 2 MONTHS) fucking hep! The couple were very good friends of mine at the time, well, he was at least. And i had been telling him since before they even started dating that I thought she was a crazy hoe. Well my hypothesis was proven correct when we learned, from the evil cunt's own mouth no less, the evil deed she had done. She had taken the remaining 2 or 3 clean rigs from their shared stash, and proceeded to stab herself with each one until she found a vein and registered, then drew back 20 units of blood, and you guessed it  injecting her blood back into her arm and rinsing them back out good as new. And how crazy is this bitch? Well, in the end she was fucking admitting to it! Like, not a guilty admission either. Like someone would expect after such a dastardly deed, but like a, ""yeah I sure as fuck did so why don't u go cry about it"" type of attitude. In the end she said that he would have left her if he found out she had it and that he himself didnt, so she infected him purposely with hepatitis in hopes that he would stay with her because they shared a communicable disease I guess. Ironically though she was promptly thrown out of the bfs house(they were both living  with HIS parents, that were also informed of the ENTIRE story, by me, while my buddy sat crying into a pillow ), so she  ended up homeless and couch hopping in 0° F weather for what I'm positive was at least 3 days until she was finally  arrested for none other than felony possession of one of her hep c infected rigs. Oh and burglary. She's still locked up and he's still got hepatitis. Some people. Geez

Side note: it was not found out until it was far too late that the girlfriend even contracted hepatitis in the first place.  The only way we all found out to go in for testing was because the doctor that diagnosed her happened to be the same family doctor that mi familia visits. He saw my scarred tissue and basically told my parents that I had been iv'ing drugs and that I needed to be tested for the big C as he had already diagnosed more than one patient with the shit.  Turns out most of the crew (that actually went in for  testing) got lucky, and it ended up becoming no more than what I would call a ""semi-isolated incident"".  I myself was only tested by blood, along with a tissue sample from my mouth;the two covered hep and HIV at least, and I was not about to get my cock swabbed from the inside, fuck a bunch of that(think I'd rather have an STD lol seems like it would hurt less.) Getting off topic again, moving along.

TLDR : Don't ever trust a hep-c carrying, jealous fuckin thot. Because she might just draw her blood into all of your new rigs, rinse them out, and put the bucket back over the plunger. And give yo punk ass the hep son. 😈👩💉😧<-- do not freight this is just a reenactment of what really went down.    😎  <-- this smiley is playing  me, looking all cool and shit.

The mornings are bright and sunny, my drive into work is just awesome.  It's a completely different experience going into work on just a little oxy.

I've also noticed it takes less to get that happy go lucky feeling when I'm working.  I get so motivated, energetic, time goes by fast.  It's just an incredible experience and the only change is the fact that I took a pill.  I'm at the same place, doing the same shit.  So weird. 

Anyway, split a dose tonight so I have a 5mg waiting for me to have with my coffee and protein shake. haha   TGIF!",1429243310.0

tldr: cold copped for the first time in town, bought needles at walmart for the first time (no id, no question), shot up, feelsgoodman.png, stoked, success


&nbsp;


  
  
Question first: So since I first started shooting, I wanted to ask this question... I am always using clean rigs every shot, disinfecting my arm area with soap or alcohol swabs, using clean water, etc.... but.... Is it possible to contract Hep A/B/C or something worse from tainted dope? In other words, if I am safely and sterile injecting is there still a risk of contracting infectious disease from bacteria/viruses being on the dope itself? Sorry if it's a dumb question but I can't stop thinking about it

  Long time lurker, first time poster.
I recently went on vacation with no opiates, which normally would be an ultimate bummer but a super cool, friendly, and rad redditor (shoutz, you know who you are) hooked me up super hard with some fire gunpowder tar. This guy went above and beyond, even had points, cookers, ties, etc from the needle exchange. All in all it was a real blast shooting up for the first time (er, rather being shot up for the first time).



  &nbsp;
  


  After things calmed down and I was in a relaxed place by myself I took a read through the ""manual for safe injection"" on here. I quickly learned the ins and outs of my arm veins and how to register. 



  &nbsp;


  Vacation came to a close, I fixed my last shot and jumped on an airplane home. Once home, I was able to cop seven 30s but eventually blew threw snorting them.



&nbsp;


  I've been chewing on bits and pieces of sub strips but today the cravings completely overwhelmed me. I couldn't think of anything but getting high (and for some reason, I still feel weird asking my pill connect if I can have our mutual heroin/misc drug friend's number). So with this stupid heroin-stigma floating above my head, instead of making the correct decision and hitting up someone I know who would deal safely, I decided to increase my risk, drive downtown and walk the streets. 
  

&nbsp;



  The first 2 homeless ppl I hit up only had ice. I don't use speed (save for adderall now and again, utilitarian use only) so I kept on the search. Literally the next 2 people I hit up tried to sell me a bus pass, and then this speeded out girl needed a ride across town and knew 2 dealers that could hook it up. We walked and talked, everything seemed on the up and up. Turns out she just got out of prison (..... ""for stupid stuff, for a long time, long story"") and was staying at the dealer's house until she got herself settled again. It was really chill when we arrived, nothing dangerous thankfully.... but.... Turns out the dealer only had a dub...... but I just fixed and now I'm sitting pretty.

I never thought I would have any success cold copping downtown (or breaking out of my introverted shell to ask people for drugs).

I have been addicted to Roxies for about half a year now. I started taking opiates about 10 months ago taking Hydrocodones (About 20mg), and gradually kept going up until I was taking an average of 120 mg of roxy per day. Me and a friend of mine both decided it was time to quit. His habit was worse than mine and he was taking about 5-6 30mg Oxy's a day while I was taking 3-4. He already started his subs about 5 days ago. He took 8mg the first 2 days and dropped down to 4mg every day since then.

It's currently been about 12 hours since my last Oxy dose and I feel mostly fine, but am starting to get the initial withdrawl effects (runny nose, tired feeling). Before you ask, I've tried quitting cold turkey with kratom (didn't work), and I've tried tapering down my oxy dosage (didn't work) and I think subs are the way to go, at least for short term. They seem to be working for my friend who is pretty much in the same situation that I am in and who I would buy the oxy with. 

I don't want to be on subs for too long, and I don't really want to feel any withdrawls. I'm done with opiates for the forseeable future. I don't really have a reason to quit other than the fact that it's starting to get expensive and I'm sick of being dependant on a drug. Until 2 months ago, I was taking max 45mg of Roxy a day. (but the minimum would be 30mg every day) It really only got out of control the last two months or so. So here's my questions:





1. When do you think would be best to take the first Sub? I'm waiting at least 24 hours and probably until I can't take it anymore (which not gonna lie, I'm a pussy so it probably won't take too long). After reading about PWD though, I'm scared shitless of that happening.




2. How much do you think I should initially dose at?




3. How quickly will I be able to taper off subs enough to not feel any withdrawls?

Thanks y'all",1429235991.0

I called them first, to make sure they were actually there before I drove the half hour across town, and I noticed over the phone how friendly and helpful she was.

When I get there, I see a pretty drab looking building with a hand-painted, graffiti-style sign that said ""HRS"" (Harm Reduction Services). Walking in, there's a counter/glass case right by the door, with a barrier that read ""Staff only beyond this point"" separating off the rest of the large room, which had a large table and a bunch of chairs, one of which was occupied by a middle aged woman staff member. An old man behind the counter asked what I was looking for, and I said to exchange needles. He directed me to a black wooden container with a sharps logo on it to dump my old needles into; it was 3/4 full. He asks me for my zip code, and my age, and if I used opiates or stimulants (95***, 26, and heroin). He then asks if I want 50 or 100 unit needles, and I say 100, and 27 gauge if he had it. He didn't, but he offered to gimme half 100 unit 29 gauge and half 50 unit 28 gauge, and I agreed, saying I was only able to buy 30 gauges at the pharmacies I buy rigs at, and how my small, deep veins make the small needles more difficult to use.

This got the attention of the lady worker behind the barrier, who grabbed a notepad and walked over, asking what pharmacy I buy at and how I found a pharmacy to sell to me. So I told her about the Non-Prescription Sale of Syringes program I'd found, and how they had the list of participating pharmacies online. She was psyched about this, and asked how expensive the rigs were and how I went about asking for them. 

After this, I turn back to the counter, and the old man had gathered together an entire care kit for me: not only 50 rigs, but two little metal cooker cups, a tourniquet, a bunch of alcohol wipes, and a bag of like 100 little cotton balls with a small hole in them, designed specifically to be used as filters (I'd never seen these, they're awesome). As I'm going over the supplies, going ""Oh wow, filters, and these little cups. And alcohol wipes!"", I hear a little chuckle to my left. I turn, and an old black man with short white hair, a scraggly beard, and a big smile, obviously another patron of the exchange, goes ""Yup, it's pretty damn cool to be able to get all this so easy, isn't it?"" Yes, yes it was, and I agreed with him, smiling. Then I thanked them and left.

I'd never been to a needle exchange before, and this whole experience blew me away. I mean, just being in an environment where I can discuss my use openly and freely is awesome, not to mention getting all my supplies restocked for awhile for free. I dunno if all exchanges are like this, but if they're *anything* like this, I'd definitely recommend them.",1429225380.0

I started following this subreddit a few years ago, mostly out of curiosity, partially as a research. I had a friend who was very much addicted to Roxies and my friend group was having a hard time dealing with his addiction. We had a lot of questions and none of had much extensive experience with opiates (most would pop an occasional pill or two but never had any chronic use). Well we thought our friend was doing better, he went home and boom, he was gone. Broke my heart, as we had gotten close, but I hurt from the loss, I wasn't angry with him, and tried to be as understanding as possible in my grief. 

Fast forward a year and one of his roommates had moved into my place, and had apparently picked up the Roxie habit. Didn't give it much thought at first, mostly just said we didn't want any of that around our house. He continued his use and started to sell a little pot here and there, probably to support his habit. Things got progressively worse and he began to sell harder and harder drugs. Then one night we get broken into, by another dealer trying to steal his wares. Cops come to the house, etc. It was quite the scare for all of us, especially my user roomie. We told him absolutely no more drug selling around our house or he would be asked to leave. Shortly after he went home to get better. When he came after a month or two, looking much better and told us that he was completely honest with his parents and that he had been clean for a month. 

After he came back things were better for a short period of time, but quickly regressed back into his funk, mostly because of a mutual friend who is an encourager in both the selling of drugs and the use of them. It had gotten so bad that at the beginning of the year I finally broke down and called his family and told them I was concerned while he was at home, a week later he came back and his parents told us ""they didn't believe he was on drugs, just depressed and needed more exercise"", after things stayed the same we had all decided he needed to move out ASAP. 

Earlier this week we found him passed out, nodding out on the floor. My roommate texted him to tell him he needed to get out. A day later a shipment of syringes came in the mail for him. He told us he understood and packed a small bag that day. He said he would continue to pay rent through his lease but that he wanted to talk, which is going to happen this evening. What do I even say or do at this point? I had decided that after a week or so I would text the same family member I got in contact with the first time sending him pictures of the syringes and him passed out, telling him we kicked our roommate out because of his persistent drug use and having no regard for our personal safety. Please and help or words of encouragement are welcomed. I know that this is not as simple as most people see it, I'm just trying to help my friend. ",1429222546.0

I can't really run or jump with out feeling a sharp pain in my nose. I have trouble sleeping at night because the weight of my head is enough to cause discomfort in my nasal cavities when I lay on my side. 

The plan is to eventually come off of opiates eventually. Even though with my extended use I do not get sick when I don't use. I am just very unmotivated or as my mom puts it ""stuck on low gear"". Something stupid like putting on my socks in the morning has taken 20 minutes just because I'll be sitting there to dull to go though with the process of putting on socks.

This is kinda long, but I feel it is beneficial for some to read. A little about me: I've been doing opiates (pills) for about 5 years and been doing heroin for a little over a year.

I feel that moderation is important. Something else that doesn't seem to be brought up enough is knowing the drug you're doing. I'm not just saying know what cocaine or heroin is, but know your tolerance, know the strength of your drug and try not to push it, because that's what I did. I ended up putting way too much in my shot but felt I would be okay, just super fucked up. After banging it I knew that I had done too much and tried to vacuum my apartment to keep me from falling asleep. All I remember is putting my dining room chairs into the kitchen so I could vacuum around the table, but that's all I remember.

Apparently I went into my room and literally passed out. My fiancee found me face down on the floor, my glasses broken, and my lips were purple. Luckily she was able to arouse me and I begged her not to take me to the hospital. Believe it or not, I actually work in healthcare at a hospital and that was the last thing I wanted to do. If the people that I work with knew about my other life my career would be over. I know I'm playing with fire as far as that goes, but it's hard to give up. My hobby is to get high every now and then when I'm not working. And due to my profession I don't work a 9-5. I work 12 hour shifts 3 times a week on specific days, so I have a lot of the week to do what I want.

I don't spend most of my days getting high. I take my daughter to school, pick her up from school, work on homework with her and I cook or take my family out to eat when I don't cook.

Most people would be very surprised that I have this other life. Like I said before, I get high in moderation. It's not every day, but I definitely enjoy doing it when I get the chance. It helps me wind down and relax. When I do do it, it when my daughter is at school or at night when everyone is asleep. I also don't have to hide from my fiancee anymore. We're very open with each other.. I'm not saying that she's perfectly okay with me getting high, but she has her vices too. She's a school teacher, but enjoys smoking weed when she gets home or at night to wind down. I find nothing wrong with that either. To each is their own. I wish cannabis was something I was into, but it's not. Ever since I served in the military and went to Iraq a couple times, cannabis actually gives me panic attacks. 

Doing opiates such at oxycodone and lately heroin is my choice. I also am prescribed adderall and i find doing those with adderall or other types of speed is wonderful. It works better than any antidepressant I have ever been put on and has helped me get off of effexor. If any of you know anything about effexor it's a bitch to just stop taking. A lot of these antidepressants, in my opinion, are dirty drugs that do nothing but mask symptoms of depression and anxiety.

But I digress. So the other day I got a hold of some really good dope. Luckily, through work, I have plenty of access to clean diabetic syringes, micro-filtered syringes, alcohol wipes, and normal saline flushes to mix heroin with. I sniffed a little bit of it to gauge how strong it was. What I do is I'll make out a line of heroin and sniff it and if I get a pretty good buzz I'll then know to use about half that line to shoot an go from there. I had some pretty good #4 heroin and placed my amount in the spoon, drew up about 40ccs of normal saline and mixed it up with my gear. It mixed perfectly. I then switched the needle from my diabetic syringe to the mirco-filtered needle and drew up my solution. And from there everything was perfect, I felt great. But what fucked me up was when I thought ""I could probably do a little more"". Fast forward through the prep and a banged another one out. That's when I knew I fucked up.

I didn't just feel fucked up, I felt like, damn, something ain't right. I knew if I nodded out and went to sleep, I might never wake up. So that's why I started to to clean, to keep myself busy and awake.

Next thing I know is I'm in my bathroom puking my guts up. It's still a little hazy from there. I did all this before noon, so I wouldn't be all fucked up when I picked my daughter up from school at 315. If you're shooting heroin, the high doesn't last terribly long. So I knew I should be good to drive and get my daughter because it would have worn off by then. 

There's no telling how long I was out and if I ever stopped breathing all together. I don't know why I'm still alive to be honest. It's really fucked with my head the past couple of days. I am so lucky that my finacee came home from work early or I feel that I would've been dead or brain damaged. All for a high; but that's the life we choose I guess. And I don't wanna hear someone preach to me about stopping unless they've walked in my shoes. 

I'm so upset because my daughter was waiting for me to pick her up from school and I never showed. Luckily, when that happens, they send the kids to the afterschool program. If it were up to her, she'd do that everyday anyways, because she loves her school's afterschool program. Like I said, luckily my fiancee came home early and was asking where my daughter was (she's not her mother, but basically is her mother since my daughter stays with us majority of the time) and she couldn't get an answer out of my because I was so incoherent. So she made sure I was going to be okay and I was breathing and went to get my daughter. She just told her that ""daddy was really sick"".

I really just found out the details of it all yesterday. She told me she knew something was wrong when she walked into the bedroom and I was face down not moving and my glasses were broken as if I just totally passed out. She's not in the medical field so she doesn't no what to look for, so I asked her if my lips were blue or purple and she said she remembered them having a purple color to them. Which meant if I was breathing I was only breathing maybe 4 times a minute at the most. I know I've had to give narcan to patient's who have had the same exact symptoms.

IMO, God wants me alive, at least now anyways. I shouldn't be alive. I truly OD'd. That was my first time OD'ing. I've had other close calls with death while I was in iraq but nothing like this. 

Am I going to stop? No. I know that may sound arrogant and stupid, but I don't want to stop. I feel that I am smart about using for the most part. I'm not doing it every day; I don't ever let it interfere with work, and other than this last time, it's never affected my family. I just need to stop being so greedy in terms of the high. I need to respect the drug and not push it or I will die. Luckily I can talk to my fiancee about it and she passes no judgement. I know that I should probably always let her know when I'm going to use or use only when she or someone else mature is around in case of an overdose. I know that I am going to invest in some narcan, either from work, or ordering the nasal spray so that my fiancee would be comfortable using it on me if this ever were to happen again.

I just wanted to share this experience with you all. I hope this can shed some light on somethings. Even if you feel that you are smart about your drug use, if you do not respect the drug and what it can do, then it does not matter how smart you think you are, the drug will eventually win. If you all have any questions in regards to my overdose, please don't hesitate to ask. Thanks!

TL;DR: got a hold of some good heroin, shot up, felt great. Shot up again to maintain high and ended up OD'ing. Fiancee found me in bedroom facedown purple around lips and was able to arouse me. Always respect the drug and what it can do or it will kill you.",1429215156.0

32txtf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/32txtf/the_new_miracle_pill/,30,https://redd.it/32txtf,morbo2000,The New Miracle Pill,"There was a fight in the street.  Actually it was more of a beating.  3 high school aged kids kicked a waiter who rolled up into a ball as they unleashed on him.

""I'm calling the cops!"", screamed the owner of Far Cafe.  

This had little effect on the scene.  Sunny faced children laughing beneath a cloudy sky...angelic expressions with murderous intent.  Two cracks to the skull and the waiter went limp.  One spit on him, yelled something in Spanish and then they all casually walked across the street, got into a car and drove away.  It was Tuesday in the Mission.

In the window of Far Cafe I could see Kym sipping a bowl of soup.  Turkey Minestrone and a Half Sandwich for $6.00! - proclaimed the billboard outside.  Though sunglasses hid her eyes from me, the glazed over expression and mechanical movements spoke volumes.

""Hey"", I said sliding onto the stool next to her.  Kym slowly looked over at me and smiled her dreamy high on something good smile.

""Hey babe...back from school?"", she asked.

""Yeah.  Just a break though.  I need to research a better model for my stability of matter paper.""

Kym stared at me blankly.

""Are you speaking Chinese or something?"", she asked seriously.  Soup dribbled out of the corner of her mouth.  I took a napkin and wiped it off.

""I need some inspiration.  You got anything?"", I asked.  She fished through her purse and handed me a box of mints that held no mints.  Instead there were these pills I had never seen before.

""What's this?""

""Perks.  Ari got me some.  Said its like prescription heroin.  I don't know about that but its pretty fucking good...""  She spoke slowly as if deep in thought, shrugged and went back to her soup.

I popped 2 and drank it down with her Sprite.  Kym stared at me with her mouth open.

""I said go snort it babe."", she said.

""What?  No you didn't.  You asked me if I was Chinese or something.  I should snort it?""

""Yeah.  Go.  Use my bullet...""

So I did.  15 minutes later I sat next to Kym eating her half turkey sandwich and watching all the cops outside.

""Whoa this is like TV.""

""Yeah those kids kicked that guy's ass for weed.  Can you believe that?"", said Kym.

""Shit that will be Jason soon if he doesn't stop messing around.""

A plain clothes cop walked in with the owner and looked at us.  

""You guys see anything?"", asked the cop.

""No man.  We just got here"", I said.

""You sure?"", asked the cop again obviously not believing us.

""Yeah.""

""Terrible!"", said the owner going back behind the counter.  He handed the cop a diet Coke.  ""The fucking drugs are killing this neighborhood!""

Kym looked at me, put her two fingers to her head like a gun and whispered, ""Bang, bang baby.""

I mentally classified those pills as an OK high.  But Kym must have ate a lot.  She was floating a good 3 feet above her body wearing that feral cat grin she gets when she's really feeling it.  We reached the corner and I was going to walk back to the bus so I could finish my papers.  But  Kym started shouting some Persian gibberish at a homeless guy who asked us for a dollar.

""Yanno fuata morrarai!"", she growled at him while stalking forward her chin thrust out and teeth bared. ""Quetah?!  Quetah modo mastaka?!""  Her head snaked back and forth like a cobra as she advanced on the baffled looking homeless man.  

""Get away you fucking demon bitch!"", yelled the man falling backwards.  

I dragged her away and she started giggling like a little girl.

""What the fuck Kym?"", I asked.  ""What the hell are you saying anyways?""

""Oh I don't know.  Don't you ever speak the languages of all your dead ancestors that walked before you?  Hmm..?""

""Ok I'm taking you home"", I said.

I forgot about the library two blocks later as the pills entered my bloodstream.  Time slowed as a euphoric wave washed slowly over me.  Huh.  Well that feels nice.  

""Like honey dripping over your bones..."", said Kym to the trees and the sky and the city.  

At home I cleaned up the mess from a party a few nights ago and drafted my research paper.  Kym had a bong hit and played PaRappa the Rapper.  This damn game annoys me to no end but right now the music didn't bother me at all.  Kym was amused and hell, I felt perfectly fine.  In fact, I felt great.

""Hey Kym?  What's Ari's number?""

I knew Ari in the dorms.  He is a med student but a chemist at heart.  Ari was a great source for clean LSD.  I got Ari to sell me a bottle of perks and went downtown to meet him at McDonald's.

""Yeah my cousin can get boxes of this stuff"", he said between bites of fries.

""Boxes?""

""Yeah.  Also a lot of guys I know get free samples man!  Fuckin' Berkeley medical program YEAH!"", yelled Ari pumping his fist like an annoying frat boy.

""What is this stuff?""

""Its called OxyContin I read the papers on it.  Its a opioid alkaloid they synthesize for mass production.  A new pain relief product.""

""Like what?  Morphine?""

""No better buzz.  Maybe heroin?  I don't know.  Every douchebag has their opinion but man it feels good eh?  Plus its waaay safer than heroin.  That shit will kill you bro.""

""This won't?""

""Well if you took the whole bottle anything would kill you.  But these perks are easier to control.  Take 1 or 2.  Mellow out, chill.  Maybe another later?  But that shit you guys snort and smoke?  Who knows whats in there?  These little babies are blessed by the FDA.""  

""Wow.""

""Hey you drink beers with this stuff yet?  You get a little energy buzz like coke but with a sweet body high..."", sighed Ari.  ""And they are great for coming off psychedelics.""

""Kym looked pretty wasted.  She was snorting them...""

""Oh yeah?  Snorting?  I gotta try that.  Hey I gotta go.  Anatomy in an hour.  But no worries man!  Like I said I read the FDA statement.  This shit is safe!  Enjoy my man!  Enjoy!""    

Note: Before pill finder or the collective wisdom of the internet some people called oxys -Perks.  Now I am beginning to think it was probably short for percocet which was quite popular and considered strong.  So calling an unknown drug after an established one makes more sense but hell, I always thought it was Perk - Like Perk you up buttercup.",1429207768.0

I started when I was 23, fresh out of the Marines. That was six years ago. I'd say in those 6 years I have been clean for 2. On again, off again, you all know the drill and I am no stranger to the agony of that perpetual cycle of withdrawal life.

Things have not really been going great as of late. Lost the job, racked up debt, driving on a suspended license, girlfriend of 8 years has had it with the bullshit I put her through and the negative energy I constantly project onto her, parents don't trust me, I never have cash in my pocket, sober fun stuff is not fun unless I'm high, I'm depressed, I lack meaningful direction, and basically feel utterly useless to the world and myself. Ya know, typical life in shambles (granted I know I could be much, much worse off) type of bullshit.

Anyway, this evening I copped a dub sack (around 2 points of some pretty good Pacific Coast Washington tar. Lately I have been chipping since I quit the needle around October. This time around my ROA is smoking with maybe 5 needle  uses because I am super pale and I bruise/get tracks no matter what size needle I use even if I don't miss. 

Well tonight I was out trout fishing at the local park so I couldn't go home and grab foil without arousing suspicion from the SO, so I decided, since this dope was hard and pretty close in consistently to powder already, I would try snorting.

I took my bag of goodness to the local 7-Eleven and grabbed me a straw (my smoking tooter is a little large for the job) and headed down the road to a spot I usually go to behind a Shell station that had a secluded back parking lot surrounded by embankments and buildings almost all the way around. I chopped everything to a fine powder in my dimly lit car and divided out four equal lines of brown delight. My tolerance isn't what it used to be so I only railed the first two lines, kicked back, browsed Reddit, and waited for the euphoria train to come to town. Ten minutes later in snort the last two lines. 

It was all gravy until all of a sudden, I hear some commotion and I see a car come back to the parking lot im in. Which mind you was not a large lot, two rows, maybe 100 feet by 30 feet. I was parked in the middle with my engine and fortunately my interior and exterior lights off. The car stops and I peak out the back window to see a kid in a backpack running in front of the cop car, the officer yelling for him to stop and drop what is in his hand, and the heart stopping sound of a narcotics dog barking with purpose. Oya, I failed to mention, I just started on my two years of probation for a bullshit felony marijuana possession along with criminal conspiracy charges (that is another story in itself). All charges will be dropped pending good behavior/fines/yada yada. Of course under the probation terms, I obviously can't get any criminal charge or the probation charges come back in full ass pounding force. 

All that raced through my mind was, ""Oh boy, this is it, I'm fucked. I'm sooo fucked. The car is gonna get impounded, I'm going to be in waaaay more debt because of the fines, I will undoubtedly have a real criminal record, the girlfriend will leave me for sure this time, and I am 100 percent sure I won't be able to explain this one away to the parents.""

Fortunately I had the window open a little when I parked just in case of a situation like this, so I could hear if someone was walking up on me or whatever. 

After my current life flashed before my eyes, I went straight into junkie survival  mode and lowered my seat to make it look like I was taking a nap if I was approached. I threw everything in my glove box and locked it up. I then laid down in my seat and awaited judgement. 

About ten minutes later, the cop car drive off and must have thought my car was just a parked car with no one in it (thank science I have tinted windows) and paid me no attention. ""Holy fuckin' shit!"" I muttered to myself. Dodged that bullet. 

I have had this feeling for a little while now that something shitty is bound to happen soon. Murphy's law ya know? If it can happen, it sure as shit will happen... eventually. I am taking this as a sign from Junkie Jesus or the universe to get the fuck out of this game. My life is already screwed up enough as it is. There is no fucking point to make it worse. Summer is coming and I am scared/excited about doing it sober but it is something that has to be done. One can only have luck that keeps them out of trouble for so long. In the end it always runs out. 

Be safe out there and listen to your instincts, they are the only thing that truly has your back in this game. Happy nods.",1429351187.0

Chemistry and physics papers loomed over me.  The semester was drawing to a close and it was time to deliver.  So how I am preparing?  Jason shot me up for my second time ever on my hand.  A bandage discreetly covers this from Kym.  

I did H and coke bumps with Kym before we went out to see some band.  How was the band?  Who was the band?  Hell if I know.  Then more drugs.  Mostly coke but I am faaading.  I melt in this chair guarding Kym's purse while she gets drinks.  Kym always gets the drinks.  Busty thin girls wearing corsets get great bar service.  Whoa I am nodding...so I pull out my Gameboy and start playing Pokemon to focus.  Must level up my Abra.  Psychic pokemon are the best.

A beer slams in front of me and I look up.

""Hey Kym...""

""Don't hey me!  Who the fuck was that?"", she demanded.  I have a vague recollection of an old childhood friend...Oh yeah.  Did that just happen?  Yes it did.

""You mean Jenny Svoboda?  I knew her in high school..."", I said.

""Did you see her chatting him up in front of her boyfriend?  And what's up with that hug?"", piped in Jason smiling evilly at me.

I shook my head at him.  

""Now Jason...""

""I gotta take a piss man.  Just keep watching Kym's purse and playing your Gameboy hotshot"", he laughed as he walked away.

I looked up but Kym was gone.  So I went back to Pokemon and thought about life.  Pathetic.  3 years of school and now I am failing AND becoming a junkie?  I have 2 quizzes tomorrow and I'm playing Pokemon in bar while high on heroin?  What kind of a man am I?

""Hey relax bitch!"" came an angry male voice.  

I looked over.  Kym was menacing my old high school friend and she had one hand in the pocket of her black leather jacket.  I got mesmerized by the graphic on her leather for a second - A woman staring through a glass and half her face was a skull.
 
Jenny's companion was a tall, nordic looking clean cut guy.  The kind of guy that looks like a tourist from Kansas compared to the freaks in a San Francisco bar at 1:30am.

""Yeah please take it easy ok...?"", said Jenny meekly trying to smile.  

""Bitch I'm going to carve your fucking face off and wear it while I stomp your skanky ass!"", screamed Kym. 

Crap.  I looked in Kym's purse and her little black combat knife was gone.  So I stood up.

""Whoa!  Who's this guy?"", exclaimed Jenny's friend as he zeroed in on me.

I stood there helpless.  Staggered under the sheer weight of the shot and the bumps...heroin is not a good fighting drug.  I needed way more cocaine for this shit.  My mind raced.  Save me brain!, I commanded.  Defuse this situation...the guy's fist pulled back and CRACK!  

Jason sucker punched him.  Quarters fly through the air leaving beautiful silvery trails before they bounced and splashed across the bar room floor.  The guy collapses into a table knocking it over as drinks and ashtrays spill across the dance floor.  Now there is much screaming and yelling.  

""Fuck my laundry quarters!"", says Jason.  Then he shakes his hand, ""Fuck my fucking hand!""

People circle around us staring.  Kym grabs Jason, pulls him towards me.  ""Grab your Gameboy and my purse we gotta go!"", she says.

The guy Jason hit with the roll of quarters was unconscious and bleeding.  The bouncers tried to make us stay but we bolted out the door.  Running was amazing.  I felt like I was flying above the pavement...

""HEY!"", yelled Kym, ""Come back and get in the car!""

Kym peeled out and floored it across two side streets and made for the bay.  We pulled over into a Denny's parking lot to get high.  But I was already floored.  

""C'mon babe!"", said Kym still ignorant about my new shooting habit.  She laid out several bumps on a Bauhaus CD case.  I felt guilty.  We don't have many secrets between us.  So shooting up with Jason?  This was an ugly future fight but please not now.  I'm way too high.

""Naw..""

""Well I want some"", said Jason helping himself to a bump.  Then he dumped more coke out and added to the piles.

""Why not?"", said Kym, ""We didn't have much.  Or did you guys sneak off without me...?""

""Here take it with some coke"", winked Jason, ""It will even you out.""

So I did.  My heart felt strange.  Rather than beating, it now wobbled and THUMPED.  This was the heaviest I have ever felt.  I freaked out for a moment...and then bliss cascaded over me with a sigh.

""Ohhh fuuuuuck..."", I moaned.

Then the car was moving.  As I came back into focus I heard the Eagles Greatest Hits.  With her purple mohawk and pierced nose, Kym did not look like an Eagles fan yet she knew every song by heart.  Life is contradiction.

Streetlights shot by like celestial bursts of star struck madness.  Billboards glowed like galaxies.  I flowed through this cosmos.  A timeless creature made of love.  I looked at Jason.  He was curled up in the back seat.  Great guy.  I love Jason.  I looked at Kym.  Kym is all my love.  All.  My whole being aches for her smile.  Watching her now fills me with love.  Watching her dance and sway both hands in the air as she hypnotizes me with her ancient erotic charms is...Wait a second.  How the fuck is she steering the car?!

WHAM!

And we kept going.  Suddenly I was totally awake.  Jason kinda groaned and twitched.  

""Did you hit something?"", I asked looking around.

""Yeah"", shrugged Kym.  Now both hands were on the wheel.     

""What did you hit?""

""Car.""

""A car?""

""Yes I hit a fucking car!  Shit!""

""Shouldn't we stop or..."", I asked.

""Yeah thats a great idea"", said Kym sarcastically, ""Lets wait for the cops.  We'll exchange info!  Oh but I have a suspended license!  Jason has warrants, oh and we have felony drugs were probably ID'd for that bar assault...""

Jason pulled himself up and croaked, ""Kym you are the Devil's daughter.""

""Go fuck yourself Jason. We need to get home.  Now.""

She swerved around around a van waiting to make a left turn, narrowly missed a car coming the other way and gunned it straight down familiar streets towards home.

Home.  Inside Jason disappeared into his room.  He winked at me and I knew.  The needle.  This was sad.  We all used to snort or smoke and talk in the living room.  Now needles changed the ritual.  Needles were dirty.  Private.  Things to hide from the light....I went in our room and collapsed on the futon.  My soul was heavy as Kym walked into our bathroom to wash her face.  Fuck it.

""Kym...""

""Yeah babe?""

I sighed, lit a smoke and she walked over and looked at me.  I looked away and took a drag.

""I shot up twice.  Sorry I never told you..."", I sighed.  

I looked up and her eyes were studying me, searching.  So I met them.  Our souls connected and this was not the drugs.

Without a word Kym started stripping.  First her tight jeans.  Then socks.  She shrugged off the heavy leather jacket though our unheated room was barely 55 degrees.  She unfastened the corset, tossed it aside and slipped out of her silk panties.  She stood before me nude.  I marveled at her perfection.  This is why the sculptors in ancient Greece used young girls when they created a goddess.  For a goddess stood before me.  

And then I saw.  Her arms...her hands.  Pin pricks.  Red tracks cursing her perfect skin.

""When?""

""Don't blame Jason ok?  I made him promise.""

""Its OK Kym.  But..how?  Did Jason get needles?""

""No!"", laughed Kym, ""I went to the park to meet Dev and Melo for some weed and the needle exchange van was there.  Dev gets her shit there so I went in and this nice hippie guy hooked me up.  Tiny ones for hands , bigger for arms...Sorry babe.  I wanted to tell you...""

""But how long...""

""A month?  More?  Fuck are you pissed or what?"", she asked.  Tears framed the Egyptian mascara design around her sea blue eyes...

""No.""

We hugged and she cried.  Relief.  Truth is so liberating.  But another truth loomed.  Needles were an inevitable end of all things good.  

""What do we do?"", I whispered in her ear.

""Do?"", she sniffled looking up at me.  ""We enjoy.  We push it to the wall like always.  We go all the way...But when it's time to come home - promise me you will take me with you?  Ok?""

""What?"", I asked confused.

""You are strong enough to stop.  You do it all the time.""

""Kym we can't be like this forever...""

""I know I know.  I want more too.  Maybe even kids I don't know..."", sighed Kym.  

Then she slid out a box of tampons from her drawer and took out a makeup bag.  Inside was a surgical tubing, rigs and empty bags I had never seen.  I sat down next to her.  With practiced ease she cooked up some tar, tied me off and gave me my first arm shot.  Fuck...I sagged into the pillows of the futon.

Kym was still naked as she cooked up the next shot.  Her eyes were fixed on the concoction she brewed within the silvery spoon.  Her eyes did not waver as she tied herself off.  Tubing clenched in her teeth she stared at me.

32zlob,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/32zlob/still_addicted/,10,https://redd.it/32zlob,Drabbstep21,Still Addicted.,"My overall use of opiates has declined over recent weeks/months. Mostly because of no connections and infinitely bad geographical location. If I'm lucky I'll score opiates once every two weeks. 

Without opiates, I drift toward the next readily available option, methamphetamine. Before coming here I never really did it that much, In fact it was taboo in my hometown. We all looked down upon meth while, at the same time, became heroin addicts. 

Now that I'm older and more experienced altogether, I no longer discriminate against any drugs or the people who use them. To me using any substance is the same as another. The end results are different, but for me, I'm just looking to get high. And I'll take what I can get.

Last week I went on my longest binder with crystal. When I finally came down my urge for opiates was as strong as A multiple week heroin WD. I couldn't stop thinking about it, I had the feelings of dread and despair, and I was getting extremely desperate. I just couldn't accept the fact I wasn't getting any opiates, and getting more crystal wasn't going to solve any problems. I had no urges for more meth, only opiates. 

Then I came to the conclusion that I'm still addicted to opiates and I'm blatantly wasting my time hoping doing meth will fill that gap. The sad part is almost every time we end the binge, I come away saying I need to quit and how much I hate it. 

This has been on my mind since last weekend, and just wanted to share. Maybe one day I'll find what it is that can cause satisfaction and content. I'm just hoping it's not a chemical leading to my demise.

And i don't stop doing methamphetamine.",1429321321.0

I could just use some clarification on a few things.
1cc syringes?
How much (weight) BTH do you do in a shot?
Distilled water? How much?
Cotton ball?
How do I make sure there are no bubbles in syringe (lol)?

Well, the paper towels didn't work cuz when I get out of the car the pool is covering half of the seat and is dripping down the back. I sprint upstairs and get some 409 and a whole roll of paper towels with my ass still leaking down my pants and finally get his car clean.

The next time I experimented I did 15, then, 20, then 25, then 30, then 35, and now I'm at 40. Each time I dosed there were months in between so it's not like I took them and developed a tolerance. I've taken them with an empty stomach, a full stomach, and still nothing. Until today. So, at 40mg I finally felt something and all I got was a little tired and itchy and had minimal euphoria. I had to pretty much lay down and stay still to even notice too.  From what I've read that's not a normal starting dose for opiate naive people. Why did I have to take so much?

He made us both sit in the back so he could keep his lunch on the passenger seat while we drove around.  ""Jesus are you wearing makeup?""

""No"", I said but then I thought about it.  Kym was doing something to my face while I was laying on the couch but I was too high to care.  ""Maybe?""

""FucknA bro"" said Carl after a whistle.  Then he turned around and gave me a serious big brother look, ""Your lucky mom's not here to see this.""

I sighed.  This was going to be a long day.  

""Why do you guys dress like that?  Like biker queers?""

""I'm bi actually"", said Jason raising his hand.

""Don't talk to me.  If your dumbass knew how to lock a fucking door it wouldn't look like I'm taking two faggots out for a Sunday drive."", said Carl gnashing a bite from his Togo's pastrami sandwich.

""Carl why are so macho?"", asked Jason in his innocent guy voice.  I elbowed him to shut the fuck up but naturally he couldn't help himself, ""I mean you ARE the sexy buff guy that always takes his shirt off in public.  Not me Carl.  Is this a cry for help or maybe...attention?""

""I take my shirt off for surfing and fighting!"", growled Carl, ""And shut the fuck up.""

We were an odd trio driving down 26th Street in Carl's 1971 Mach 1 Mustang.  The universe may seem like a random chain of events but there is always an underlying current of logic and order.  Or so I thought.

I borrowed mom's car because I had study group meetings all over the bay including peninsula suburbs unreachable by BART or Muni.  This was legitimate and mom sanctioned it.  But Jason also borrowed the car to steal things, buy things and sell things.  Jason stuff.  But I find it is best to stay out of his affairs so I never ask.  

Regardless, on Saturday morning around 3am - Jason parked mom's blue 1983 Dodge Dart on our street.  We spent Sunday HIGH and when we looked out the window...the car was gone.  We filed a police report like good citizens and then I called mom.  

There is no God because Carl was there mowing her lawn.  He grabs the phone from mom and tells me to ""Grab your faggot ass friend and gear up!""

""When we find the car we go as a team ok?  Just follow my lead.  Oh and I have a bat, golf club and a shovel for weapons.  None are illegal yet all kick serious ass"", said Carl.

I don't need this.  My high was long gone.  Jason was coked out so he could banter with Carl but fuck I was getting sore and twitchy.  I didn't bring anything because if Carl caught me with drugs he would take them away and then punch me.   

""Ooooh!  Oooh!  I get the golf club!"", said Jason raising his hand again.  ""It's only fair.  I was on varsity golf!""

I stared at Jason with deep loathing.        

""Right on Jase!  Good call"", said Carl seriously belching beer fumes, ""I want the shovel.  It's like a bat with a metal skull slapper.  Bro you get the bat.""

Carl gunned his muscle car engine at a bicycle messenger that dodged and weaved through traffic.  The Mustang engine sounded like a dinosaur growling low and then BELLOWING as the tires started to screech.  I hate this stuff but Jason got into it.  He whipped off his shirt, leaned out the window waving his golf club screaming, ""THE DARKNESS COMES!""

""Shut the fuck up!"", said Carl.  

We drove around.  It was useless.  I knew enough about the city to realize mom's car would either be chop shopped or ditched by now.  Chop shop was for good cars.  A 1983 Dart was not a good car. 

""Fuck I gotta piss"", announced Carl.  

We were in Hunter's Point by the waterfront park.  This is not the place for white people in a muscle car.  Carl parked like an asshole across 3 spots, told us to relax and went off to piss in the park restroom.  As soon as he was gone Jason pulled out a bag of heroin.

""Oh hell yeah"", I said as he chopped lines on Carl's Black Sabbath cassette tape cover.

I got four good snorts when I heard Carl burst out of the restroom.  So Carl.  Never open a door when you can KICK it open.  Good eyes on my big brother.  No way he could have seen it but when he saw Jason staring as my head was down snorting heroin.  Oh he knew.

To his credit, he kept his shirt on.  But he was on us in an instant.

""Out!"", he barked yanking the back door open.  

Why didn't we pretend to pee and do this in the restroom I wondered as I staggered out.  But fuck...who cares.  The Pearl Dragon powder is best in tiny bumps to allow maximum absorption...I had 4 bumps right before Carl punched me.

""Junkie fucks!  Losing mom's car!  I bet you fucker sold it for drugs!""

I was used to this.  The beating would be savage as brothers never pull punches but I knew he would not kill me.  I took a couple shots and went down gasping.  The throat punch was the worse.  But Jason...Dumb bastard ran.  Carl surfs every day, works construction and can outrun a deer.  Baseball bat in hand he caught Jason by the edge of the shore and thumped him.  I was content to lay in the broken glass of the parking lot but Jason's screaming made me get up.

""Carl!  Stop!"", I coughed.

Jason was floundering around the mucky shoreline in duck shit and weeds.  He held his face and his ribs as he limped back to the car.  Carl made him dump the heroin into the muck.  Then he found a hose on the side of the building and washed Jason off who cursed and yelled.

""Shut the fuck up!  You're lucky I don't leave you here."", said Carl aiming a blast at Jason's muddy black leather jacket.

I looked down on the ground.  Almost 3 grams.  I felt sick inside as my mind wondered how much duck poop, cigarette butts and broken glass can you eat to get high off of some of that?  

And then we went to Taco Bell.

""Hey I've been hit with a bat...like once I think in Little League.  Its not that bad right?"", he said eating some nachos.

Jason's head was swollen from Carl punching him and probably only the narcotics pumping through his blood allowed him to sit upright in front of his uneaten taco.  Even from the parking lot I heard the crack.  Broken ribs are a bitch.  Jason glared with his good eye but had the sense to nod.  He had learned the hard way about my brother.

""Fuck I guess this was a bust"", sighed Carl sipping his soda.  ""Poor mom.""  

I wiggled my loose tooth, spit the blood into a napkin and shrugged.  

""Maybe the cops will find it..."", I said.

Two months later Carl found mom's car.  It was parked at Tower Records.  He called mom, got the spare key, opened the door and drove away.  The new owners took great care of the car.  The muffler rattle was gone, new brakes and a stereo with a CD player.  Oh and a baby seat, diaper bag and stuffed animal raccoon.  Carl that big sensitive guy threw all that stuff in the garbage before he drove away. ",1429297180.0

Hey guys, it's been a really really long time since I've been here. I cleaned up! After two ODs and losing my job and pretty much everything, I stopped. About a year ago, around February I was running out of money, my brother had been arrested(my PIC) and I met a really nice sheltered girl who had smoked weed a few times in her life. For about two weeks I took zoloft which really helped with my mental cravings, but my dick didn't work and I hated that.  I got a new job and a new place and haven't looked back. Sometimes I still get this pit in my stomach, and I stop feeling like a person worth value, or worth loving, and that makes me want to go back to doing black tar. It fades though, and I also remember what the withdrawals were like, and that mostly keeps me away. I thought about this place because a co-worker of mine gave me a norco yesterday for my back pain and then started freaking out when I told him I used to do heroin, he was worried I would relapse. The norco helped my back but I don't have a desire for another one. I guess I just wanted to say I did something I never thought I could do and I'm proud of it. Those three years I was on it all seem like some faded distant Nightmare now, it was really fun at the time though haha.

GETS MONEY 0_0 OUT OF THE BLUE,  FUCK.
Shoots most of a full point, minutes later goes on to shoot the rest after rinsing the cotton and grabbing what's left.....the guy who gave this user the previous cash injection calls and wants enough hash to buy another point of D.

User buys the next point of D.
Would this user be better off using the next point, either all of half of it.
OR
Using half or none of it tonight and saving half or all of it for Sunday night.

Has the user totally fucked himself? Will he need lope to avoid more WD? He feels like he was using just as the WD was reaching the hump, feeling like the worst was over and he was on the downslope.

Can he ""get away""with using for such a short time?
Can he push it further and even save this other point for tomorrow? Could he actually use two days in a row after nearly 2 full days off and only experience mild wd cause the worst was seemingly over when he decided to use? Did he reset everything? Will he be pushed into needing some more LOPE really bad?

People ""shotgun"" hits to each other all the time, right?  And most of us have cleaned resin from our pen tube/straw/tooter/etc at least once.  

My idea is to either have either a cigarette (without a filter at least to begin with), a joint, or a small tube/pipe with weed/tobacco in it that would be used as a ""discard"" tube that you blow your smoke through each time you take a hit.  IDK how long it would take (it would vary based on a lot of things like the size of the ""discard tube"", the amount of weed/tobacco contained in it, how often it is used, how long your hit was held in each time, etc), but theoretically over time it'd become resinated and you could smoke it on a rainy day when you have no funds for dope.  

Like I said, just a half-baked idea at this point.  I welcome suggestions, comments, and sure, even some of the inevitable ""oh that won't work because bla bla bla"" bitching and moaning.

My artistic proccess has two parts: The 'creative' part, where I write my song/lyrics, and the 'performative' part, where I sing live in front of an audience.

I've never had stage fright, even in my sober years, but heroin and benzos def. helped me in both stages of my artistic process.

For one, when I write lyrics, heroin and benzos allow my brain to write lyrics that come from very personal places, but become universal. 

Sober me, usually achieves only one of the two. High me, manages to extrapolate my experiences as a gay junkie, into universal ones. Even straight + sober people like my lyrics, because -in a twisted way- they relate to them.

As for the performance itself, my voice, my lungs and my diaphargm are more relaxed, and I reach my full singing potential, without hurting my cords. Cocaine user singers tend to stretch their limits (and their vocal cords) with prime example Adele. On another note, I am more myself onstage, giving 0 fucks, and being more creative.

I have a 15 yo foster daughter addicted to heroin who has been clean for 5 weeks now, for as long as she's been living with us. She had told me she'd like to see her 'street family' she 'lived with' for 2 years before coming to us. I asked her if it was too soon for her to be around drugs and she said no, so saturday morning her, myself and my 13 yo biological daughter set out for the city. As soon as we got on the bus I noticed a transformation in my foster kid. She looked so at home, so at ease on the bus. I wasn't the person in control, telling the kids what to do anymore, she would tell us when we had to get off and where we had to change for our next connection. It was like seeing an animal kept in a cage being set free in their home environment. As we arrived my 13 yo and I went looking for a pair of jeans for her, since she'd already outgrown the pair we got her for Christmas. Foster kid went the other direction to see if she could find her friends, saying she'd call and let us know when to meet again. I thought about reminding her one more time to please not give into temptation, but decided I'd be so overbearing she might never come back if I did. Instead, I just handed her the bag of sandwiches and chips I'd prepared in case her friends were hungry. 

Two hours later she texted she'd found her friends and they were enjoying the sandwiches. I was glad I wasn't there, that I'd let her see her friends alone. A couple of hours later, when my feet were aching from walking through too many shops, she called and asked where we were so she could catch up with us. I listened carefully for any signs of intoxication in her voice, but couldn't find any. Then again, I didn't know what I was searching for, having never listened to her high. She caught up with us in a small crowded shop and I immediately asked her how it was, trying to not be obvious about studying her eyes, but of course she knew I was examining her. I could tell my biological daughter was doing the same. It couldn't be helped. 

My foster daughter was contemplative when she came back, a contrast to the elevated mood she'd displayed in the morning. Perhaps she was trying hard to appear sober, perhaps she had a lot to think about, probably both. She showed us a restaurant to eat and asked for a specific waitress. A girl looking just slightly older than her, perhaps barely 18, came out and greeted her with a hug, speaking Spanish so fast I couldn't follow the conversation. As we sat down to eat my foster daughter told us about the visit, how she'd had found her friends squatting in a building, and how they'd spent their time just lying on mattresses, doing nothing. She hadn't been tempted as much by the drugs, as she had been by just lying down on that mattress, feeling their body heat, staying there and forgetting about all new things she had to do. She said she felt like a free bird in the city, there was no structure and there were no expectations. She could wake up every day and occupy herself with finding food and fun, no questions asked. Then she pulled up her sleeve and showed us a tattoo she had gotten just now, small black letters saying ""no excuses"" on her wrist. It occured to me that it had probably not occured to her that perhaps she should have talked to me about getting a tattoo in advance. My 13 yo daughter looked at me, anticipating a reaction, but I let it slide. It didn't matter. I asked her what the tattoo meant to her and how she paid for it. She told me that a friend working in a tattoo shop did it for free, and that it's a reminder that she always needs to put in the hard work to get what she wants, no matter what. Fair enough, I thought. 

We ordered ice cream desserts at the restaurant. I didn't want to embarrass her, but I was secretly celebrating that she hadn't gotten high with her friends. We tipped the waitress generously, as my foster daughter explained she'd eaten there for free many times. As we were about to hop on the bus back home my biological daughter, who had been waiting patiently for an opportunity to turn the attention of the conversation to herself, asked me if she could get a few more piercings in her ears. She didn't say it, but I knew she was thinking that her new sister just got away with a tattoo. My foster daughter immediately offered to take her to the tattoo shop, saying her friend would pierce them for free. At this point, my feet and my back were aching, so I gave my daughter some money just in case, and told my foster daughter to go get her pierced while I took the next bus home. I wanted to give my foster kid the chance to be the one who knew how to get things done, the one who knew were to go, one more time. This was her city. 

Sitting on the bus back home, all I had to worry about was how to explain the tattoo and the piercings to my husband, I trusted the kids.",1429433772.0

My knees carry the entire load of my body, and have been extremely weakened and injury prone. I walk and move like an 80 year old man.

My question here is, would I fuck myself by seeing a pain specialist? I do not want to go through opioid addiction again, mostly due to the financial impact and often lack of supply. If I were to start any form of opioid treatment, I would pretty much have to be 100% that I will not get cold turkey'd by the doctor (for any reasons including the dea taking away his practice, lots of that happening in texas right now.)

the goal would be to organize the contributions and discussion between the 'experts' here, so that the best simple/simplified answer will be the top of the next tier, which will satisfy most people. Then for clarification and more detail, we can figure out a consensus through more detailed answers and corrections further down the tree.

I'd like to see any response cite their sources in some way that they can be reviewed and not use non-academic sources (like sites about addiction, pamphlets etc. unless there's some original research being done). 

There's enough good scientific discussion that happens in here that the content should be more centralized and accessible- usually the best stuff ends up being deep in an old, forgotten thread in a back-and-forth between two people.

Now that that is out of the way, I have used opiates very seldom. Over a year ago, I took 20 mg Vicodin and had me feeling I guess the max high. Extreme euphoria and locked to the floor nodding, waking up high and such (Im a sensitive guy)

Before that I used vicodin like 5 times or something spread out through the year. I also smoked black tar once and smoked crushed up roxi. the roxi was by far my favorite.

But yeah Anyways the main point is: If I take say, 5 grams of kratom pills, will I get the same euphoria and shit? I say ""non addicts"" because I know people use it for withdraws, but I have no tolerance.

So, in short

opiate tolerance = 0

vicodin = 20mg

kratom = x grams

solve for X

I love how comfy it makes me feel. Lately though I've gained access to hydromorphone which is supposed to have the best rush ever. I've always preferred snorting my OC over eating it due to the faster and more intense onset so I thought HM might be a good idea. I've got second thoughts though...

First, snorting HM is wasteful right? I heard BA is only good when you bang it. There's my problem: never IVed before and don't know any users who could teach me either. Shit, I don't even know where to get a syringe, which fluids to use, if I have to cook it or not...would you even recommend it to a newbie to try his first injection by himself?!

Also, wouldn't I be crossing a line into addiction here? So far, my life is pretty good, going to college, doing fine socially and academically. Oxy is not ingrained in my daily routine, it's just a weekend thing. But I feel like a good HM rush might very well throw me off my path and make my priorities shift...still I'm so damn curious.

So I stuck to heroin as my main drug and binged on that, doing stims on the side and other stuff.  Then 4 months ago I decided I had enough so I quit all drugs, out of fear.

I don't know what happened but I became scared shitless of all drugs and all forms of entertainment/anything exciting.  I had it set that I was going to become a buddha.

Well that lasted about 3 months of feeling like shit and I figured depression wasn't going to get any better.  So I finished off the remaining H I had all this time (talk about self control right?).  The high was just ehh... it wasn't as I remembered.  But it was a nice week long escape.

So after that H ran out I went back to feeling like shit and empty.  Did a little bit of stims here and there to keep the mood up and do shit.

I thought my brain was broken forever and I couldn't feel anything else other than shit even with drugs.  Ex: take meth and feel good for a few hours then feel like shit, take H feel good for a few hours and feel like shit.


Then 2 days ago decided to drop a tab.  I was so afraid it would turn out to be another horrible trip. But it was beautiful!  I felt all kinds of emotions and now I wanna do more of it.  Typical addict behaviour.  Lol.

So one of the ""insights"" that I got while tripping regarding heroin/meth/any drug is that they are one dimensional.  Like they only give one type of feels.  Not that its a bad thing.  But LSD... man.. soooo many feels.

Obviously I'm still in the afterglow.  Idk, I'm just ecstatic to have felt emotions other than apathy or stimulated.  I can remember just a few days ago every thing I think about.. I felt humility and shame.  Like every thing I did in the past is bad.  Now I think about them and, it's like whaaaat??  There was nothing wrong with them.

Another example.. I'd feel sorry shit I may have done to people but now it's like.. man they probably moved on already.

What the hell was I thinking??

But that's depression for ya.  Perception is all negative.

T -1:00 - 40mg omeprazole

T -0:45 - 1L tonic water & grapefruit juice 1:1 (.5L each)

T -0:35 - 600mg cimetidine

T -0:20 - 3x size 00 capsules black pepper

T +0:00 - 24mg loperamide

T +0:30 - mild withdrawal symptoms disappearing fast. feeling drowsy. nothing noticeable yet.

T +1:30 - moderate sedation. not much euphoria, but it's there. definitely feels like an opioid, just lacking the strong euphoria. energy restored, cramps relieved. heavy feeling in the gut (probably from all the liquid + pills).

T +2:15 - heavier sedation, pretty noticeable respiratory depression. mild euphoria. characteristic opioid high & side effects.

T +5:00 - the experience hasn't changed much if at all. Haven't come down yet, but haven't experienced a truly 'recreational' high, at least compared to traditional opioids. pupils constricted, tone of voice changed. 'heavy eyelids' feeling. same as any other opiate, but with significantly less euphoria, however it exists. maybe this would be truly recreational for someone opiate-naive, or at higher doses. Be careful if you try this.

T +24:00 - withdrawal symptoms reappear


#Day 2

T -1:00 - 40mg omeprazole

T +0:00 - 24mg loperamide

T +0:45 - withdrawal easing, no sign of psychoactivity yet

T +2:30 mild sedation & respiratory depression. not as strong as yesterday, maybe 60% of the strength. no euphoria whatsoever. withdrawal symptoms erased completely.

T +5:00 - no changes. 

T +12:00 - laxative kicks in, shit my brains out. (if you are using lope remember to keep yourself regular)

T +24:00 - withdrawal symptoms reappear

T +7:00 - no changes. cramps in stomach / abdomen, taking another laxative.

T +24:00 - withdrawal symptoms reappear


#CONCLUSIONS

Loperamide has realistically, almost no recreational value for opiate veterans at this dose. I would not suggest pushing the dosages much higher, as it's not guaranteed to be safe at all, but you can try it. Remember to take a laxative if you don't shit within 2 days. 


*The most effective potentiator of loperamide is omeprazole, based on my experiences. Cimetidine is also very effective. The least effective potentiator was black pepper, having almost no real significant effect.*


While it's possible that this could work recreationally for someone opiate-naive, even then, the effects are lacking the strong euphoria that traditional opiates provide and will leave most opiate-lovers feeling unsatisfied. However, this being said, loperamide is phenomenal at combating withdrawal, especially when potentiated and when P-gp is inhibited. 


Be careful using potentiators & P-gp inhibitors frequently as this can cause it's own slew of issues. Please be careful if you decide to try this on your own. ",1429555794.0

She opened up to me yesterday and is having a hard time,"First of all I want to apologize for posting a lot lately. It's not my intention to hijack this sub. I realize its intended use may not be this, although I've seen some other post about recovery, relapses and addiction as well. I suppose I like posting here because I can't talk about it with many people in real life given that my foster daughter wants it to remain private. I gained some new insights into her addiction yesterday, and I am curious about how other people have felt, how it's been for you. Since I have recieved so many encouraging comments here previously, I will share with you again. 

So yesterday, she opened up to me, saying she's feeling very low and exhausted from using up all her mental power staying away from heroin. She told me it is harder now than week 1-2 of being clean. The first two weeks when she had physical withdrawal she kept telling herself that it will be over in a matter of days, the time aspect being essential, and each day it got significantly better for the most part. Besides, the physical symptoms were almost a distraction from the mental symptoms. Week 2-4, she said, had still been alright because she was constantly stimulated by new things, fascinated by how productive she could be, and felt hopeful about her future in a way she hadn't before. We went out buying items for her and her room, she started a new school, was introduced to new people, started studying. Week 3 it became tougher. She no longer feelt that her mood was improving, she had gotten used to school, the novelty had worn away, and she found the other students boring. I asked her what kept her motivated then. She said that she had made a deal with herself on the street. She couldn't possibly expect her life to be good just because she quit heroin, it wasn't good before she started heroin, so she had decided that she wouldn't use until she is 18. That doesn't mean she will start using again when she turns 18. It means she will have over 2 years to improve her life before she re-evaluates, and when there is a time-limit this whole thing is less overwhelming, do-able, she said.

I reminded her it should really start improving in just a couple of months when her brain stabilizes chemically, and asked her if she had any thoughts of breaking her deal and using now. She said no. I asked her how come, it only seemed natural she would consider it when her brain was craving the drug. She said that of course the idea popped up in her head initially, but she blocked it out immediately, giving it no place to live in her head, a zero tolerance of sorts. So she never even considered changing her mind then? No, the decision had already been made. I asked her what she thinks about instead. She told me that in her thoughts she tells herself that she can handle this, and reminds herself of her ""no excuses"" policy, explaing that she used to come up with lots of excuses for her choices before. She used to be angry with everyone who abandoned her and blame her situation for her choices, and people let her get away with it. They'd even help her make up excuses for her behavior. Eventually she decided her excuses were no excuses, only explanations, and stopped making the easy choices that would provide instant relief, but hurt her in the long run. 

I asked her what she does to cope with the low mood and irritability. She told me that she will have conversations, play loud uplifting music, masturbate, read, watch series, and do school work. She said school work sucks because she feels so behind, but that each time she completes it she feels a slight dopamine boost, and, she doesn't feel as shit about herself when she's done it. It becomes easier being in her body. She resents herself less. I asked her if there is anything we can do to help her improve her life so she'll decide to stay heroin free when she turns 18. She said we're already doing it, and that soon she'd like to start some type of physical activity to get a dopamine boost, as well as a healthy body. I asked if she'd like to try out for a school team and she said sure but she doesn't know if she'd be good enough. I said that perhaps her and I could try some physical activity together because I am in terrible shape myself. She actully got a little excited when we started googling activities, opting for the more extreme ones, such as rock climbing (I think she is in the risk zone of becoming an adrenaline junkie). I had to remind her I am 40 years old, but I'd be happy to sign her up for a course. She said that she'd like taking a summer course because she is afraid she will be bored during summer, given that she hasn't made any friends in school yet, and might not have a group to hang out with. I got out my calender and told her we can plan a trip during summer too, so she'll have something to look forward to.

Do you have any ideas for what else she can do to keep busy and elevate her mood? What are your coping mechanisms? Do you have any ideas what she can do during summer when she won't be busy with school and might not have any friends to hang out with? She likes spending time with my 13 yo daughter and they have actually bonded really well, but she needs more. I am thinking that she might enjoy being part of a some sort of extreme sports community because she seems quite drawn to that sort of stimulation. Perhaps doing some therapy during summer when she has the time would also be a good thing.

Thanks for reading!

Typically 40mg of Oxy doesn't do much to me, 20mg of Methadone has me feeling good and 300mg of codeine does almost nothing. 100mg of heroin has never felt anything other than numb to me. 

I've used opiates once in the past 6 months, 200mg of Morphine 5 days ago. It was the first nod I have ever had but I took it across 3 hours and ended up spewing a bit and worrying that if I fell asleep I would stop breathing. It felt as though I frequently forgot to breath. 

Ok, so after reading that 200ug was a starting dose I took 600ug of Fentanyl in blotter form 25 minutes ago. I put it under my tongue, held it there for 10min then swallowed. Out of curiousity I googled the dosage again and this time found people acting as though 200ug alone for an opiate naive person is insane and certain to kill them. 

Whats the situation? Will the effects have peaked by now? I want to smoke some pot but don't want to get really paranoid. I just opened a beer and was planning on some alprazolam but am going to hold off until I get my bearings.

I used Kratom to ween off and was doing well.  Ran across my old Roxi guy's number and picked up a few times from him and used intermittently over the last few weeks.  He hit me up today and asked if I wanted to get any blues so I left him some money at my house since I was working and he went to go pick them up.  No word for several hours and then I get a facebook message with this long story about how he got robbed at gunpoint and all of his money and phone was taken.

I know what you're thinking.  First of all, never give anyone the money without seeing the drugs first.  And second of all, he's probably lying about getting robbed.

Both of those things are very true.  I thought I'd be angry and upset, but it's actually kind of a relief.  It's a wakeup call that I don't need to be doing opiates anymore, particularly since it involves dealing with sketchy people.  I feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulder.  My mind and gut have been telling me this for the last few weeks, but I still had the urge to use.

I'm going to try to use this as a learning experience and wakeup call.  I'm 4 days clean now and through the brunt of the WDs.  It's a mental battle from here.  I'll be using /r/opiates and /r/opiatesrecovery when I need a supporting word.  

I could use some reassurance on one aspect.  I'm nervous that his phone (which apparently got stolen) has texts from me about getting blues/80s.  I figure if he made up the story, then I'm in the clear in terms of any law enforcement problems, but I just have this irrational fear that if somehow the people that robbed him get caught, there will be incriminating texts from me on his phone.  However, I keep telling myself that if the phone was stolen, the people will wipe the phone to resell it and that law enforcement would have no interest in me anyways.  However, I am anxious by nature (one of the reason opiates were such a nice getaway for me), so I could just use some objective reassurance that I don't really have anything to worry about assuming that I cut off contact from my middleman (and I have zero clue who the person he was picking up from and they don't know me).  I told the guy to remotely wipe his phone.  Dunno if he'll do that.

In today's case, my org is totally in the right. The opposing side thinks they are, obvs, but they're just wrong. On top of that, rather than work through the case as toe parties trying to resolve a problem, they've chosen to be rude, condescending, unreasonable, and generally stupid. And I have to respond in short sentences saying only ""ok. I understand your position"". I'll fight our case in my briefings and keep my mouth shut on all these side issues. 

And Come home and get high af. The End.

I've attempted recovery many times. I told myself that this was going to be the last.

I'm about a month in, 8 mgs twice a day. Today I ran into an aquaintace who gave me 2 morphine 30s for helping her out a while back. I almost turned them down but that fiend brain of mine took em. I took em home and stared at them for about 5 minutes, then crushed em up and railed them. This is about 12 hours after my last dose of sub. I got a tiny tingle with a few kpins. Yay.

So, of course I regret it. Now I'm worried that i fucked up my whole suboxone regiment. When am I safe to take my regular dose again? I know this is asked repeatedly, but I've been on 8 mgs twice a day for a month with no slip ups until the 60 mgs of morphine 12 hours after my last dose.

I figure since theres still so much sub in my system I would probably be okay to take it at my regular time tomorrow, possibly even tonight.... what do you guys think?",1429657712.0

Free from all the anxiety, depression, and utter fear of life..  Free from your OWN internal voice bringing doubt and negativity into your very own being.  Some where during your time here on earth, someone or something made you feel inferior, stupid, not worthy, some SO broke your heart, some losses and experiences have happened to you that have left you traumatized, and you haven't found a way to let go... It's sad, but a lot of people probably judge and don't even realize that you're a smart cat..  You have found a way to cope with life, and not kill yourself, through the use of opiates..  They fuckin work..  And the fucked up thing is.. Society, your friends, family, some of these people that gave you these scars, judge you in a negative light for doing the only thing you know how to do to remain happy.  You have these scars you can't digest, and people leave you with more scars for doing the only thing you know how to do to try and stay alive, and stay on their emotionally positive and social level.   Somewhere along the line someone told you that you were no good...  that life sucked or that you sucked... that you can't do certain things or be a certain person while being clean.  That you're not worthy of love, or of a good life..  and you believed it.. You may have even developed some defense mechanisms like I did and say that you don't even give a fuck about anything that happened in your past or about anyone else..

As I think more about how I can help my foster daughter new questions pop up. Right now we have a problem that she isn't really making friends in school and feels lonely. She's only been a month in school, but high school freshmen generally make friends fast, and it is concerning that she doesn't see any potential friends in her classes. 

First of all she is 1-2 years older than her classmates, and secondly, she is more experienced than they are. She tells me that being in school is surreal, she feels as if it is all a joke, that she is not really part of the school, just a fraud, faking it, pretending. When she interacts with her peers she doesn't disclose much about herself because she says it feels that would distance them from her even more. That's also perhaps part of why she feels so fake, she's not sharing her background much, and they appear to assume she's just like them, but she thinks they are sheltered, naive and entitled. The conversations she listens to in school can be about a teacher grading them too hard and therefore being an idiot + a cunt. They'll continue this topic for an hour, mocking the teacher, discussing the teacher's looks and private life, and apparently they put up notes ridiculing teachers in their lockers. They'll also talk about sex, boys and gossip, because that's what girls that age talk about a large percentage of the time. My foster daughter says most of them don't even know their boyfriends, are almost too shy to talk to their boyfriends at all, and don't even have sex with them. 

My foster daughter doesn't enjoy conversations shittalking teachers or other students (apparently they talk about other students just as often, making up rumors). She has had a boyfriend she lived with on the streets for months and their relationship appears to have been a deep one. She can't relate to her classmates at all. She says that it's like they don't even have their own thoughts, it's as if they're brainwashed and just reflecting the thoughts of society. And the ones that do have their own thoughts don't say anything, either because they realize they'd be talking to walls, or because they are too shy, or too afraid of being bullied. 

It seems to be that being outside of the system has given my foster daughter a sense of perspective few young teens have. She finds it ridiculous that she can't go to the bathroom during class without getting a ""bathroom pass"" from the teacher. She thinks it is ridiculous there are men with weapons standing in the hallways. She thinks it is ridiculous that she isn't allowed to be there if her bra straps show. One of the first days her bra straps did show so she got told she had to go home and change. Instead, she went into the bathroom and removed her bra, and then the outfit passed, despite the fact that she was wearing less cloth now. She also hates the sexual ed class she is forced to take, calling it moralizing, just a bunch of opinions she doesn't care for. 

Do any of you feel similarly upon rejoining the rest of society after being lost in heroin for some time? Are there any specific non-opiate-related venues where you tend to meet non-addicts who you can still relate to well? 

Yestersay when my foster daughter was studying in the library after school, her lab partner in one of her classes, walked up to her and asked her on a date. She said that his voice was trembling and his eyes didn't know where to look, so being put on the spot with no time to think up a polite no that wouldn't make him feel horrible, she said yes. Last night his dad called me and asked if it is alright that they pick her up on Friday, taking the kids to a reataurant for a supervised date, the parents eating at another table. My foster daughter seems to not know whether to cry or laugh regarding the date being supervised. She got a ride with them home from school and the dad had been asking her quite formal questions about her favorite subjects in school, etc. It's weird for her. She said he acts as if she is a little kid, so she pretends to be one, but in reality she feels like an adult. 

Any ideas? How have you made friends when leaving heroin?

33kcpx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/33kcpx/great_party_except_the_blood/,8,https://redd.it/33kcpx,morbo2000,Great Party Except the Blood,"We were at one of Mr. Maru's parties.  We saw him earlier dressed in a white tuxedo with a tropical orchid boutonnière.  His entire head was hidden in a white beekeeper's hood.  He smoked through the veil with his 2 foot long silver cigarette holder.  Though I have been to many of his parties and bought drugs from him I have only seen his face twice.  

""Do you like art and color Kitten?"", asked Mr. Maru who always called Kym Kitten.

""Sure"", smiled Kym.

""Then please enjoy the punch at the buffet"", he said with a slight bow.  If you listened closely you could hear a trace of a Japanese accent in his English.  

The vegetarian buffet was staffed by Hare Krishnas in apricot colored robes.  No shoes in the hall so we tossed our combat boots into the pile of dress shoes, loafers, high heels and sandals.  You had to be purified to enter so we washed our hands and feet in silver vessels.  The monks serving food both answered any questions you had about food and blessed you.  At the end of the line were 2 crystal kegs of fruit punch.  Both had ice and chunks of sliced tropical fruit.  The only difference was the keg on the left had a rainbow painted skull and crossbones sign.  We drank from that one.  

We sat with all the other guests on thick, Persian rugs.  Ornate silver hookahs stood as conversation pieces.  Trays of flavored tobacco and hash were available.  As a poor student I could not believe this.  Kym caught me eyeing the hash and gave me a look.  

""We're guests"", she said while grimacing after a swig of the rainbow punch.  ""Show some class.""

Chandeliers with real candles and gaslight torches illuminated the space.  I sipped my rainbow punch.  Nasty.  Bits of fungus and god knows what else went down rough.  Barefoot waiters in tuxedos came by taking drink orders so I ordered a Mai Tai and Kym asked for a root beer float.  This was turning out to be an amazing date.  Kym's face framed in the illumination of flames was a mystical sight.  The psychedelics kicked in.  

But there was a third wheel on this date.  Addiction.  We shot up before we came over.  This no longer felt dark or mysterious.  Shower, shave, shoot and put on clothes.  We were high as we wandered into Mr. Maru's Victorian mansion.  After dinner we walked in his tea garden.  3 people dressed as ninjas stood beside a pagoda in the middle of his koi pond.  They blew huge marijuana bubbles that wafted towards a crowd of delighted guests.  Kym followed the crowd trying to suck weed bubbles before they floated away.  

I saw Neela our neighbor.  She wore an emerald green sari with orange trim and looked like an exotic flower from a land far far away.  She winked at me as she stepped behind a gazebo decorated with strobe lights.  I followed.  In this flashing madness she offered me a spoon of Mr. Maru's fine white Dragon Pearl.  The rush burst over me.  For a second I felt myself peeling away from my body...I shivered and sat down on the grass.  Fuck.  Heroin.  Good.  More.  

When I was able to form the words I looked at Neela and asked, ""Can I buy some?""  

I wandered around the warehouse looking for Kym.  Some maniac was welding a metal cyclops and people were gathered around the flying sparks cheering.  Across the floor past the giant graffiti murals I saw her.  She stood at the entrance of a bright green Chinese dragon.  Sculpted from paper mache, the dragon was over 8' high and it snaked a good 30 feet through the warehouse.   Inside it I could hear demented, cackling laughter.

""Don't go in there"", whispered Kym leaning in to kiss me. ""They go in but no one comes out...""

I stood there by the dragon's mouth and looked at Kym.  I forgot why I was here.

""What's in your hand?"", she asked.  Oh yeah.

Went into a bathroom to do lines.  Whatever was in that punch made me slow and sloppy.  Powder was everywhere.  Some of it coke, some heroin.  We should do more coke.  Wait?  Is this coke?  Or heroin?  Kym smiled at me as I scooped up the whole mess and dumped it in a bag.  Time out. Do over.  The coke bag had a twisty tie and the heroin one Ziplock...I measured out more coke but no more heroin.  No more heroin.

The coke animated our bones as we propelled ourselves like underwater creatures through Mr. Maru's fabulous mansion of delight.  In a theater room we watched some old black and white horror movie.  After awhile we realized many of the people around us were fucking.  We ate popcorn and ignored them.  The movie tripped us out.  The punch made everything warp and grow rainbow bubbles.   Colors bled into the black and white film.  I realized my mouth was hanging open when Kym poked me.

""I have to leave.  I'm freaking out...""

We found a room and did some more lines.  I wanted only coke but I think we did the mixed bag because I could feel a nod coming.  It galloped from the nether worlds growing larger and more powerful...Kym's voice sounded far away and sleepy.  I woke up and realized she was still talking.

""...the part where she slept in the bed holding the ghost's hand was wrong Babe...just wrong.  And all those people humping during that weird movie.  Why?  Bodies like clay dolls, faces like gargoyles...""

I nod out.

Next the door opened.  Light pours in.  I nod out.  Next a voice.

""You two should leave.""

And I nod out.

A sigh.  Eyes straining to open.  Something is happening.  But I am in the Other World.  I can't get back.  I can barely see the Real...and this is what I see:

I see a man in a sparkly purple cocktail dress.  The sparkles from the desk lamp create a maroon 3 dimensional galaxy around him.  This man is sad.  He seems far away sad.  That distant look in his eyes as he stares at the ceiling.  I nod out.

My eyes open.  I see him.  He is slowly putting on lipstick.  When he is done he purses his lips together.  He lights a cigarette and puts away the lipstick.  Then he holds up a gun as he leans back in the chair.  The gun points at his head.

""No!"", I croak.  My voice is thick and garbled but my wits start to return.  ""No man.  Nope.""

He looks at us.  We have nodded out on a couch.  Kym's head is in my lap and I am sitting upright.  And I nod out.

I wake up.  I look and he is staring at us.  He is talking.  I concentrate and hear:

""I'm gonna light those motherfuckers up...""

The guy stands up with the gun but the door opens letting in more light.  A man dressed in a black suit appears.

""Reginald!  Fuck!  Put the gun away!""

""I'm gonna light those motherfuckers up!""

""Don't do this!""

And they wrestle.  A man in an Armani suit and a man in a sparkly purple cocktail dress fight.  With a gun.  I squeeze Kym.  Fuck.  I shake Kym.  The Armani suit guy rears back and clocks the the guy in the dress.  Then he grabs a thick glass ashtray and proceeds to pound the guy's skull.  Fuck.  I shake Kym.  She wakes up for a second.  Her eyes focus on a guy in a suit cracking an ashtray into the face of a man wearing a purple dress.  Then she looks at me annoyed.  She flips over, buries her face in my chest and goes back to sleep.  And I nod out.

""Did that happen?"", I asked while fishing out a lighter from my jacket and igniting a cigarette.

""No"", said Kym shaking her head slowly as she leaned over and took a drag, ""No way that happened.""

Kym exhales.  The smoke drifts over chunks of broken glass from an ashtray, cigarette butts and blood.  By my boot is a clump of yanked out hair and an earring with a tiny piece of pink meat still attached to the hook.  The smoke drifts across the room to a closet door.  Beneath the door crack purple sequins spill forth.    

I grab Kym's hand and pull her up.

Not your typical question),"This is going to be shortish. I'm on mobile. Please read this, I'm concerned for my health. 

I've been clean from heroin for ~96 hours. The whole time, all I used was a handful of lope and maybe 4mg of bupe to curb the worst of w/d. 

I was just having some really intense cravings and some minor w/d. After I let it pass, it came back 15 minutes later in force. I decided that to sate my needle fetish, curb my desire, and hopefully enable me to sleep, I would shoot some Suboxone. I know you're not supposed to do this, but fuck me I did it. I injected probably .75mg of a sublingual film. Filtered once through a cotton. I didn't feel anything for maybe 2 minutes, until I sat down for dinner and started to feel weird. 

I felt like I was going to have diarrhea, or throw up, but I did neither. My pupils didn't pin or dilate, but my face became very flushed and my eyes became semi-bloodshot. I quickly ate and then laid down, and on my way to bed, my kidneys started to hurt incredibly bad and I started feeling my airways close up. I know I'm not allergic to anything, because I've successfully taken subs dozens of times, but the pain in my kidneys is really what worries me. My heart rate didn't increase much, but my blood pressure did quite significantly. 

I decided if my air constriction became any worse that I would call for paramedics, but it settled down and my kidney pain eased. My lungs still feel sluggish and heavy, and I have a slight headache. Blood pressure is back to normal, but I don't feel any more well than I did before the shot. 

I feel safe enough now to just let this pass, but I'm not a medical professional and my quick Google search didn't return anything helpful. I'm less frightened than I was when I began typing this post, but I would really, really appreciate information about what the fuck made that happen to me, and if there are any signs I need to watch for that would necessitate medical attention. Thank you for reading.


For clarification, have you ever woken up having to piss so fucking bad, that it actually hurt to pee, and your kidneys hurt afterward? Kinda like they were either imploding or just being mangled completely? That's how the pain was. But much worse. Nearly debilitating. My poor fucking kidneys have been through so much. I really hope this isn't as serious as they tried to make it seem it is. Because they were not happy. ",1429755925.0

He's had a lot of other changes in his life recently and has been depressed for a very long time. He told me today his heart has been broken one time too many and he doesn't really see a point in living. He said if he did it, he wouldn't tell anyone, he would just do it.

Well I've been talking with him about it and begging him over the past couple hours to just at the very least call me before you do it just to talk. I also said if he doesn't want to talk to me or I don't answer, he should at least call his ex or another friend or at the very least, the suicide hotline. That's all I want.

He said if he does it, he knows exactly how he's going to do it and I can pretty much guarantee it'll either be an overdose of dope or a whole bottle of 30s he gets to sell for a lady with a script.

So I'm really trying to get Narcan on hand for at least me and his ex gf so we can make it in time if he tries anything stupid. I'm just hoping he'll call :/

Over the past few weeks, i've become VERY dizzy/light headed after about 3 hours since my initial dose. My initial assesment was that I was taking too many, but immediately dismissed this as tolerance only works in one direction. So, I thought this being a symptom of ""coming down"", I would increase the dose with the same effect. Very dizzy, almost about to pass out at any moment.

I've tried switching to roxy to avoid to acetomenaphen contained in the perc, but the same problem is happening. Does anyone have any advice as to what I should try? I tried going to hydro, but the problem persists there as well. Basically, my timeline goes like this:

Dose>High for about an hour>Dizzy/Unsteady 3hrs>Off

I eat regularly, and this only started to occur about a month ago. I do not take any other medications or have any exotic diet which would cause this that I can think of.

I DO notice that if I force myself to be very active (exercise or do manual labor at the office) it seems to go away. However, if I sit down I begin feeling very dizzy.

Fucking idiot. I got my cash, and I got my dope, thank Jebus. 

In an effort to make my threads more enjoyable you'll notice I'm going to ditch the details that irritated me and would be no fun to read. 

So, it's late here and I didn't need to turn off the ringer, but am I the only one doing that? Isn't it lame sometimes when you're right about to shoot up and someone calls out of the blue? ***SURELY YOU GUYS AND GALS HAVE SOME INTERESTING AND HILARIOUS STORIES OF GETTING CAUGHT OR INTERUPTED WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SHOOT UP/GET HIGH***

So please, SHARE 'EM. Even if I'm the only one reading them I will be coming back to this thread to read them.

Lastly my question, I used MOST of this point for a shot, and I have a friend that's used ,a little but long story short(jettisoning boring details again)he's not usually cool about using at his house...he lets me use there but he bitches and even tho he's going to help me get some money that's being wired to me-via his bank acccount- if I go right into well I got the cash time for dope he might give me a good deal of grief. It will still happen, but I was thinking of literally letting the cotton(or the cotton could be washed and I could use just the liquid) dry out. 

I've done this as of late with good results(just liquid) let the liquid dry out for the next day instead of loading another rig. I was wondering what you guys think about this. it's stored in a cool dry place, but it is in the open air.

It's not sitting long but is it stupid to leave a small amount of dope liquid sitting in a cooker overnight. My plan was to let it dry out and wet it and slam it right before he picks me up to go to his place tomorrow after work. This will avoid his bitching and I can get my dope later after I leave his house(even tho I'll want it right away) I know it's not going to full on destroy my goodies, but does anyone have an opinion as to how much it could damage the goods?

Should I just slam the rest tonight and deal with his shit?
Or even slam the rest and avoid using until I leave his place, maybe take a couple of lope with me. 

I don't really need help on whether or not to use, that's opinion, what I'm more interested in is how damaged will the dope be. THANKS GUYS/GALS. 

I really kinda want to slam what's left, another part of me feels as tho it will feel extra special when I slam it right before he picks me up.

First time I was so naive.  ""Alright man, alright alright.  $40.  $40 man"", said the nice young man wearing a sleeping bag poncho while licking his dry lips and snatching my two $20 bills.  ""Wait right here ok?  Be right back man...""

Hah.  It's funny.  But Kym saw him a week later.  She called him out.  Now I knew I blew it.  I was over it.  Portland hippie street kid got me.  Me.  Dumb fucking college jerk.  Live and learn.  But Kym?  Walked right up to him and shoved him.  That one has fire in her veins.  She pulled me in.  When he denied her I had to crack him one.  My friend Stan joined and whacked him with a skateboard a few times.  He bled as he limped away but to what effect?  I was still the asshole.  Now I was just a violent asshole.  Ahh lying.  Part of our game eh?

Yesterday was payday.  Kym and I converted our meager checks into cash at the Indian liquor store.  That fucker lies.  Unlike Kym or most of my friends, I posses the power of math!  I caught him more than once ripping people off with his bullshit 3% fees.  He likes to round that 3% to about 5% if you aren't paying attention.

Most of that cash went to our roommate Paul.  Paul is an awesome force of nature in the city.  Want to know where the party is tonight?  Ask Paul.  Best clubs to get your 20 year old girlfriend in with her cheesy fake ID?  Ask Paul.  Need some weed?  Coke?  How about HEROIN?  Ask Paul.

This is the same plan I have been following all semester.  It's a fucking great plan. 

I jog up my stairs and can feel the excitement building like 2 tectonic plates colliding.  My addiction is waiting for what's behind this door.  It feels like the doorknob will explode when I grab it.  Hey...What the fuck is this? Suitcases and boxes near the door.  Paul peers out nervously from his room.  My stomach sinks into nausea.

""Hey..."", he says meekly.  

Fuck.

""What's going on?"", I ask.  But I don't really care because the answer is not going to be heroin.

""I gotta go.  Lets sit and talk for a second...""

I follow him in and he hands me a beer.  I ignore it.  He knows what I want.  He knows between me and Kym is about $400 worth of heroin.  Paul rubs his face.  His eyes are red like he's has been crying.  With a shaking hand he lights a smoke.

""Look man...remember that guy I was dating?  The older guy that was married?"", he asked.

""No.  Well, kind of...the guy who got us box seats to the Warrior's game?  He's the guy you get X from right?""

""Actually cocaine.  It was coke and rocks and meth.  But I uh fucked up.  Bad.  I owe you and I owe Kym and I am so sorry..."", he said and he breaks down and cries.

This is weird.  On the one hand I was 21 and Paul was the first gay friend I ever had.  A real eye opener.  Things like how he would bake us cookies or cry during movies was bizarre to me.  But on the other hand he was a hell of a nice guy.  So much fun hanging out out with Paul and following him in the city.  People loved Paul and the world just opened up whenever he went out.  Drinks flowed, everyone danced and his suave party like there's no tomorrow happiness was contagious.  Eternal debauchery and many many awesome stories.  But on the other hand, Paul was a junkie like me.  And this junkie had $400 of my money.  

And now comes The Story.

""As you know I spend a little more than I bring in"", sniffled Paul.  ""I was always floating this sum of like $1000 dollars.  I can always move the drugs to cover but I got too deep.  I blame the meth.  Fucking shit drug!"", he growled.  Then he pointed at me, here's a tip, ""Keep Kym away from the meth.  She likes it a little too much...""

""Ok"", I nodded.  This was bullshit.  Kym hated meth.  She loved X.  The thing that blew my mind was Paul was my age and actually HAD a $1000 to blow.  I never had more than $500 and every penny was always spent.

""Anyways I was in for around $2000...""

""What?  Two grand!""

""Yeah.  Moving coke and heroin is expensive.  To get my cuts which I SHARED with you guys...I had to move more than a few 8 balls and many many grams.  All those clubs and bars...its not just a party.  Business too"", said Paul stubbing out his cigarette.

""So I owed.  I figured the best way to get paid right away was to...fuck I feel so ashamed!"", Paul moaned covering his face.

""What?""

""Jeez why do you think I slept with that old man?  He was a cheap fuck.  Ugly, smelled bad and nose hair.  Ewww.  He used me...""  

More tears.  I wished Kym was here.  Maybe this was a performance maybe it was truth but it was definitely weird.  If I cried in front of my brother Carl he would either slap me or put me in a headlock until I choked out.

""So I came up with an idea.  I would blackmail him.  He was married.  He had kids and that precious job at the airport.  So I left him a message on his work line.  I asked for $5000.  Cash.  I can make your life hell!, I told him.  It can all come crumbling down you coked out faggot!"", snarled Paul.  ""All you need to do is pay me and we both move on.""

He lit another cigarette and stared at me as if challenging me to say this was bullshit.  And he was smiling like a crocodile.   

""The part I screwed up was where he got his coke from..."", said Paul.  ""This is why I have to go back to Florida.""

Paul told me left his threat and an hour later the guy called and said he would pay.  He didn't want any trouble.  So Paul was happy.  They made an arrangement for an airport drop.  Public place...Paul felt safe.  This guy was married and secretive.  He never came over to our place.  Paul always met him in motels or in cars.  

So Paul was shocked when he came home and found a man sitting on our couch.

""Right where you're sitting"", said Paul.  ""Everyday looking dude.  Jeans, polo shirt, jacket and a Yankees cap.  Just sitting there.""

The man acted like he lived here and was drinking our beer.  He invited Paul to sit.  Paul was so shocked he sat.

""Hi Paul Sylvester"", said the man.

""Who are you?"", asked Paul.

""I am a friend of some people who like to keep things status quo.  Do you know who I am talking about?"", asked the man.

""No"", said Paul defiantly.  

Paul was ready to call the cops when the man pulled out a handgun and pointed it at him.  

""Jesus I have never seen a real gun!"", said Paul shaking his head.

""Do you know who I am talking about?"", asked the man again.

""Yes"", answered Paul in a small voice.

""Good Paul.  Now I was sent to let you know we don't like your threats"", said the man putting the gun down in his lap.  ""I was tasked to make sure you know people are not happy.""

""I'm sorry...It was a stupid.  I won't-""

""Oh I know Paul Sylvester.  I know"", said the man picking up the gun and using it to scratch the side of his head.

""Please..."", begged Paul.

""Our friend wants you out of San Francisco.  In fact, it would be best if you left the state.  Go home Paul.""

""Ok"", agreed Paul.

""You know I can find you anywhere Paul"", the man said casually.  ""So no more threats.  No more calls.  No more nothing.  You see our friend anywhere...you turn around and you fucking RUN.  Understand?""

""Yes!  I understand.""

""I knew you'd understand Mr. Paul Oliver Sylvester from Pensacola, Florida"", said the man.  ""Well, I've said my piece.  We're done.  Say Hi to your sister Kathy and your mom Janice Mae.""

Paul nodded.

""Oh but Paul, you know travel expenses on the west coast are high.  I'm a little light.  How much cash do you have on you?"", asked the man.

""So yeah"", said Paul to me shrugging, ""The cash is gone.  That creep took it all.  I had to give it up!  And I have to leave...fuck!  But he is threatening my family..."".  

I stared at Paul.  On one hand he was genuinely scared.  He wasn't faking that part.  I know San Francisco is where Paul wants to be.  He thrives here.  He burns like a neon sign and draws in all the moths to party and love him.  He is in his element in the city by the bay.  

But on the other hand...I am starting my shaky cranky withdrawals.  My heroin connection roommate says he is leaving right fucking now.  Oh and he gave $400 of our money to some thug? Bye bye?  Fuck this.

""How about our rent and me and Kym's cash?  What about that?"", I asked.

Paul shrugged and looked annoyed.  ""Well I'm sure I'm sorry!  I was afraid for my life!  And I was robbed...""

""Look man"", I said standing up, ""You have ALL our money...""

Paul acted defeated.  He pulled a bag of H from his shirt pocket.  Maybe $50 at the most.  Maybe.

""This is my personal.  Take it.  Here have some coke too"", sighed Paul tossing over 2 skinny bags.  ""Oh and...""

Paul pulls out a checkbook.

""I have enough for half today but don't cash the other one until next Tuesday ok?"", said Paul scribbling off 2 checks.  Each one was for $200.

""Uhm thanks..."", I said holding the tiny bags and checks.

""No thank you.  Good bye and good luck my friend"", smiled Paul hugging me.  His cab came and he was gone.  Forever.

Kym laughed when the first check bounced costing me $15.  She warned me not to cash the second one but I did...it bounced.

I've been trying to kick over and over with very little luck!. So I've sort of given up at least for now but want to limit use away from bangin. I did almost a month with no H and now I've picked up 6 grams and I decided to try out monkey water.

So I mixed up .5 of some good tar into a visene container half full of water. I let it drip into my nostrils until I feel a burn in each one. Hold that for 20 second or so then repeat 3x ...so four doses up each nostril. 8 total and this used a negligible amount of the visene bottle.

I feel very laid back! No rush but I'm pretty damn high and guess at most .2 went up my nose. I can use 2 or 3 grams in a day if I have enough dope.

**Disclaimer** *I am* **not** *some condescending douche; I have many friends in the South and the following has always racked my brain since I lived there from late 2006-2012.*


I lived in Alabama for a while a few years ago and during that time I went to Florida a bunch. During my time there I noticed that the types of people that frequent those areas are ^quite strange to me but, this phenomenon of pushing **absurdity to a new level** that *seems* to be **ingrained** in the fringe constituents centralized in this area *still* astounds to me.

Does *anyone* have a theory of why the Southeast portion of America seems to have an *abundance* of outlandish behavior? I understand, from living there for a time, that poverty could play a factor but this **cannot** be the solitary reason since indigence is not exclusive to this area.

This type of erratic behavior is what led me to relocate back to my origins in the North East because on any given day, I could get caught up in a scenario that while unorthodox to me, seemed *acceptable* to my using buddies there. Maybe, due to hardships being common in Alabama, the desperation is on a whole new level, but **rarely** did these tactics end well.

The Southeast drug scene is an oddity that is *interesting* indeed. I found out the **hard way** that it is **better observed** than experienced, IMO. While I was involved in it for a while, and left me with *many* stories, the whole experience left me **baffled** without *any* insight into the workings of these ingenious strategies and the frequency and *seemingly* one-up-man-ship nature of it all.


*Looking forward to some interesting theories!*

It happened in our county. I just posted a comment about this on the original post but.... there is and was no legitimate reason for a gofundme to pay for her medical bills. since it happened in California, she is eligible for Medi-Cal health insurance. When she awoke from her coma hospital social workers would have helped her apply, it owuld have processed within two weeks, and been retroactively applied to all medical bills going back three months prior to the time of application. I used to work in this field and know the system in and out. Medi-Cal covers every penny of hospital treatment. I feel sorry for anyone who donated thinking they were helping pay for treatment. Even if you dont apply for Medi-Cal, hospitals will work with you to reduce bills and make them manageable. It is federally illegal to be denied life saving treatment because of ability to pay.

Then around Christmas last year I started getting into them pretty heavily and about mid january I don't recall the last time I have gone more then a day without other then one week straight where there was absolutely nothing around( Well there was something but my so called friend had his own stash during this time, therefore he did not need help so would not help me. He will only help me when he is hurting). 

Anyway I have tried to mostly stick to a 12 a day(Dillies) but of course there are many times I will end up doing a 30 or more a day. Problem is now, (In the words of Trainspotting) I might as well shove em up my ass for all the good they do me. 

Seriously all it does for me now is I get a very MINOR rush for about ten seconds and then I am just.. not sick. 

I do not get high anymore, I miss the feeling of the rush of what felt like a warm wave of water rushing over my face, then the itchyness for about half an hour or so. I understand dillies dont have much legs but I used to feel a mild buzz for a couple hours. Now its nothing.

Do you think I just built my tolerance up? If i were to do like 80mg in one shot, would I possibly get a buzz then? Of course I couldn't afford that all the time but perhaps I may try it?

Or is it just that opiate build up thing I have heard about where your body just stops getting high. I am going to try and force myself clean for a couple weeks starting right now. . Think that will help? 

Never had this problem before with heroin(Though I never used more then a few days a week) and always got a high even from dillies until I started doing them daily, then the high got less and less. ",1429829850.0

Please help me shed some light on this subject by posting stories, articles, links, personal biases and opinions. 

**For those who want my definition/idea of so called DOPE RAGE, well it goes a lil something like this:

Dope Rage is rage, ofcourse, or anger that occurs more frequently and with harder magnitude because of the use of opiates, both occasionally and recreationally when users or dependent. Although it happens a lot more when the person is dependent on a opiate, it can and will occur in a user that uses opiates/opiods in a less frequent manner (once a month lets say).
It doesn't occur all the time, but when it does it usually happens when the user had dosed enough so he or she feels the opiates but isn't sedated enough to the point where they are nodding but they are high. **NOTE*** they can be super fucked up nodding or super dope sick and suffer for DOPE RAGE.

So basically it happens to everybody that uses that I have seen, and I deal with a lot of addicts and occasional opiate/opiod users.

Well today I attempted contact for a second time, this went a hell of a lot better.

There is a gas station at the corner of the road I live on in suburbia and its the only one that is close to all these housing development areas that I live in. So everyone in the area goes there for milk and bread and those ""run and grab some...."" deals. I am in there a lot. I chat with the clerks from time to time and buy some scratch off tickets. Well today I stop in and I get behind this guy who is buying rolling papers....I think shit this is it! I found someone that is at least smoking something they have to roll! So I casually follow him out to the parking lot and start talking. He is completely open about what he has, what he can get, and everything. I am literally jumping from excitement (on the inside of course). So he gives me his number and I shoot him a text. We part ways and I head back into the station (got a winning ticket $5). The clerk that I know asks me what I was talking to that guy about and asked if I knew him or something. The store was empty so I just came out and asked him too. At this point I am feeling pretty confident. He said he knows someone but doesn't have their number so he calls over another guy over and I have no idea if this guy is cool or not, I don't talk to him much. To my surprise he motions for me to come to the side because people are coming in. He calls his guy and gets the ok, I now have two hook ups in a matter of minutes  from each other. The second guy only has weed or so this clerk guy says. I get home and get a text from the first guy.... Hey, I can get you whatever you need weed, pills, boy, girl, crystal, anything and I even have an escort if you need a lil something else. 

I feel pretty good about my second attempt at contact and as soon as I get some extra cash we will see how well these new friends are at what they do. ",1429959640.0

In order to avoid a confrontation in front of a fucking probation building with legal workers inside, I gave him four subs that he's gonna sell to make his money back.

33ssx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/33ssx9/lost_my_heroin/,26,https://redd.it/33ssx9,morbo2000,Lost My Heroin,"""Call me Daddy you freshmen fucks!"", bellowed Robin who was our crew chief in charge on this fine, filthy morning.  Robin was from India and majored in electrical engineering.  In the bowels of the dishroom, the mechanical whirring drowned out our voices so we could scream and curse as much as we pleased.  Robin enjoyed this.  He had a low opinion of dorm kids.  

""Spoiled little cunt fucks the lot of you!""

It was true.  2 years ago when I was in the dorms I never thought twice about cafeteria or cleaning up after myself.  Swipe your student ID, load up on Peanut Butter Captain Crunch, coffee, toast and eggs.  Steal a donut for later.  When you're done, dump the remains in the trash and place the filthy tray on the conveyor belt.  You never thought twice about the the poor, downtrodden slobs in the dishroom.  

Now I am a poor, downtrodden slob in the dishroom.

""What is wrong with you spoiled, rich godless motherfuckers?!"", yelled Robin, ""Dump your fucking trash!""

I ended up in the dishroom like all the other poor bastards slaving away in the filthy, greasy, chemical laden steam.  Desperation.  You don't have to make payments on your student loan if you worked at the university.  

""I hope you didn't need this you stupid cunt!"", mocked Robin as he threw some poor dorm kid's ID into the trash.

I work between 2 spinning wheels with a conveyor belt running between them.  Trays full of half eaten breakfast slide at me for 3 hour shifts.  Dump any garbage, grab the washer and spray shit down.  Dishes and bowls on one wheel, plastic cups and trays on the other.  The wheels spin in opposite directions so when you're hungover it induces a demonic form of motion sickness.

But unlike half of the crew this horrible Saturday morning I am not hungover.  I am worse.  I am fiending.  Last night we ran out around 9pm or so.  Smoked the last trails of foil and held it in...even passed it back and forth with my girlfriend trying to get the most.  Fuck, maybe the naysayers are right.  Maybe we are wasting it.  Maybe we should get some needles...

So we tried to get drunk and coked out to forget about it...but my body has a great memory.  I woke up Stan on the way to work.  

""C'mon!  I always help you out.  Just a little.  I have to go to fucking work and feel like shit man...""

So Stan relented.  Probably just to get me to go.  He groaned as he fetched his stash while still wearing the same clothes he wore last night at the club.  I made a mental image of where Stan kept his stash- the Italo Calvino section of his bookshelf.  Fucking Lit majors.  

In a crumpled up cigarette wrapper I have what was supposed to be 1 point for $10.  But I only had $7.65 cash.  Fucking Stan taxed me.  Barely enough for a couple lines but I took a tiny bump before I clocked in.  

Yes sir!  I went to work with a smile.  

But now its wearing off.  To soothe myself I sometimes thump my pocket with my rubber gloved hand to feel the plastic crinkle.  Soon...yes.  Then some ungrateful dorm rat SHOVES his tray in.  All the backed up trays get rammed forward dumping garbage and dishes all over our feet.

""You fucking little twat!  You'll never graduate!"", screams Robin.

I grab a smoke break.  Most of the guys and gals in the dishroom smoke so smoking is sacred.  You do not deny a dishwasher a smoke.  Outside I puffed with some Russian transfer students.  Surly, silent bunch but a sign of the times.  No more CCCP or USSR.  Now our enemy scrapes filthy dishes side by side like a swell comrade.  I wonder if they can get good drugs in Russia?

Back on the line.  Only an hour more to go.  Before I eat my free breakfast (best part about working this shit job) I will hit the restroom and do a bump of H.  Maybe I'll save some for Kym.  Maybe not.  Maybe I'll fake sniffle, snot and ache like she does sometimes.  

""Next fuckface that spits gum on a tray gets my slip resistant footwear up their motherfucking ass!"", yells Robin.

I whack my pocket with my gloved hand and hear NO plastic crinkle.  What the fuck?  Panicked I leave my station to take off the glove for a more thorough search of my pocket but Robin screams, ""No more breaks!  Back to your station!""

Everyone looks at me.  They sense my weakness with less than 45 minutes left on the clock.  We are a team and almost done.  I get back to my station.

When the last tray goes through the belly of the beast I tear off my glove.  Fuck!  Paranoia was right.  The tiny cigarette wrapper plastic is gone.  I walk around like a zombie searching the ground.  Nothing.  OK.  Relax, breathe.  Why is it so fucking hot in here?!  Ok lets backtrack...Fuck me!  My smoke break!

I skip the free breakfast and search the back area alone.  This is where we compact trash, recycle boxes, cans and glass.  My eyes search and search.  Nothing.  Fuck.  But any trash by now would be in the compactor.  The industrial square pit of doom.  All trash ends up here.  At the end of the shift someone would close the double doors and fire up the machine to grind up the trash.
  
But now it was open.  Nasty.  All the morning cafeteria and kitchen trash just starting to stink with last weeks rotten remnants.  But I was not alone.  A young Mexican girl used a cardboard box to sift through trash.  

I looked inside.  Could I find a crumpled, plastic wrapper with a tiny sprinkle of heroin amongst all the egg shells, milk cartons, half eaten bagels and coffee grounds?  I had to try godfuckingdamnit.

I walked past the girl who was obviously disgusted by the rank smell.  I was less squeamish after a shift in the dishroom and jumped right in.  Inside the filth I gave the girl a slight bow of acknowledgment.

""Good morning.  What are you looking for?""    

""I think I left my student ID on my tray"", she said.  

I laughed.

""Well fuck you!"", she said, ""What'd you lose?""

""Heroin"", I answered truthfully.  

I grabbed an empty egg carton and used it to prod through the filthy contents.  Needle in a fucking haystack.

""Whatever"", said the girl searching through a stack of goop near my feet. 

And lo and behold.  Though my eyes were hardwired to seek a crumpled plastic bag from a box of Marlboro Lights, I saw the corner of unblemished white plastic in the muck.  I held my breath because Ice Cream Bar Saturday was still rotting inside as I plucked up the student ID.  Yolanda S. Luna. 

""Oh my God!"", shrieked Yolanda.  ""You found it!  Oh my God I LOVE you!""

I shrugged and tossed it to her.  Then I went back to digging through trash.  I could feel her staring at me as I searched in vain.

""What are you really looking for?"", she asked.

""Heroin"", I answered again.  

Then I cursed and punched the wall.  Useless.  I would not have to fake withdrawal symptoms with Kym.  

""I can get Oxycodone.  That's not heroin but a medical grade opiate.  You do like opiates don't you?"", asked Yolanda.

I dropped my egg carton shovel and climbed out.  This girl was speaking my language.

""I'm pre-med.  I specialize in chronic pain maintenance.  I want to work in a hospice care system for elderly cancer survivors"", she said.

""I double major in engineering and astrophysics.  I want to work for NASA and understand the Universe"", I replied.

Yolanda was cool.  She brought me into her dorm where I stuck out like an open sore.  I smelled awful, wore filthy stained clothing and had a really bad mohawk.  My pierced eyebrow was swollen because of the black eye I received from a disagreement at a bar.  Yolanda gave me a bottle of Oxycodone pills.

""These are 30s.  Instant relief so you can eat them or snort them.  We snort them"", giggled Yolanda.  ""I don't do heroin but I would imagine these will do.""

""Yeah?"", I took the bottle.  

Kym and I had done what our friend Ari called Perks.  But it was Oxycodone.  And it WAS good.  Yolanda was the second pre-med major I knew that said Oxycodone is Great!  I think heroin offers a richer body high than Oxycodone but if people like Ari and Yolanda keep passing out these pills then we may be entering a New Age.  Heroin is a bitch to get.  Not just the crime, violence and death but black tar is everywhere now.  Smoking off foil sucks.  The purity from Mexican tar is weak too.  

I brought home the pills and Kym was bitchy in the withdrawals from the previous night.  She had to go to work in an hour and my story pissed her off until I got to the part with the pills.

""Give me some pills"", she said.

We crushed 4 and Kym created a field of bumps on the table.  It looked like tiny grave plots in Lego land.  I played video games as Kym walked around nude and did bumps.  Then she showered, changed into work clothes and had more bumps.  Makeup, peanut butter toast, tea, some more bumps and then work.  I did homework.  No complaints or withdrawals and more than half the bottle left.  Maybe Oxy will save us from the needle.

I know that I shouldn't be complaining because he's doing me a ""favor"", but seriously, if you wanna kick it, ill fucking come back to pick you up.

The kicker might be knowing that although ive let my money walk, the middle man hasn't run off with it. At least then id be on edge if I got fucked or not, now im just without reason. 

The worst of it all though is the fact that despite how long ive been sitting here, listening to streetlight, bitching on reddit, tripping over headlights, none of this will matter once I score. 

I find some twisted pleasure in that thought. The dope man will roll around the corner and ill be chipper as a fucking hummingbird. The past two, three hours will melt away as he slumps listlessly into my passenger seat and mumbles, ""here, its hooked up, can you break me off a piece?""

Usually it's nothing, but not today. My fiancee's brother had committed suicide and was just found.

He was an addict as well, and for the past year life had turned into a shit storm for him. 

He had been living with my SO and I for the past couple of months. He had lost his marriage, his kids, his $25/hour job, and his home in the past 6 months to a year. The Whole time that was going on he stayed strong and said he wasnt  going to stop till he got his kids back. 

Now he was one of those people that tried way to hard to get you to like him, He would always give people drugs with the promise of getting paid back, and would constantly get fucked. 

Now I'm not saying this stuff to down him, I loved that kid. He and I spent a lot of time together, And he would open up to me about his pain for losing everything. We had all kinds of fun, but fought like cats and dogs I thought of him as a brother to me as well.

So he had gotten kicked outta our apt because he lost his job and lied to us about it. So he went back to his parents house to stay. 

Now I said earlier that he tried way to hard, this was the final straw, yesterday he had finally got some money and wanted to get high. I was still mad at him for lying (I'm a hypocrite I know cuz I lie to, please don't remind me) so I kept ignoring him about helping him out. So later on I find out, he had went to another girl, bought a gram and she took off with everything and left him sitting at a random ass laundry mat. He kept calling me for a ride, but I kept ignoring him. 

Now all this random babbling I've posted is to get to this point, FUCK this disease, and how much it fucks with brains. I was to selfish yesterday to go help him cuz I was worried about getting high myself. God, I could've talked to him or something. 

I feel like yesterday was his breaking point, everybody in his life that was important had given him the proverbial middle finger. 

He made me so mad sometimes that I wanted to rip my hair out, but he also had one of the biggest hearts and was such a good guy deep down, but he was so deep in his addiction that everybody gave up on him.

I'm so pissed at myself for being a cunt to him yesterday, I'm pissed at him for giving up, I'm just pissed.

Now if you have something to say that is calling me a bitch or something douchey just please keep it to yourself. I'm beating myself up enough. 

I just wanted to let out all my feelings here with the people who understand. My heart is broken, and I'm in shock. 

If you've read this whole post, thank you, and I'm sorry it was such a clusterfuck but my mind is in a 1000 places tonight.

While I was waiting, a lady was there trying to recruit people for a university-funded study on opiate use, genetics, and response to MMT. I used to be a psych major and I remember what a bitch it was to find participants, especially if you had a niche study, so I gladly volunteered. The study involved bloodwork, a series of questions (about your drug use as well as tests for various psychological disorders) and a follow up one year later over the phone.


First she started me with the bloodwork. I was a little worried because after 4.5 months clean, I recently relapsed after discovering my piece of shit boyfriend (who got me hooked on the shit to begin with, but that's another story) has been cheating on me. In the past 2 weeks, I've used 10 times. I have really small finicky veins that have always caused me problems. I've never been able to hit myself - that used to be reserved for my boyfriend - but recently I found a friend who is a wizard with my veins.  Anyways, both arms were super bruised from having used so much recently and the lady immediately noticed this and asked if I had recently used. She didn't care when I said yes (quietly because I was planning to lie to my doc about the frequency and recency of my use...), just asked where the best spot would be. I warned her I often had a hard time and told her my veins roll and are super shallow. But she's a nurse so I figured she could do it. After fishing around for a minute the first time, she takes it out and decides to try the other arm. We switch sides and again no luck. For some reason she feels bad even though I keep telling her I'm used to it and have a high tolerance for needle pain,  and she says we'll skip the bloodwork this time.


We do the survey portion and when we're done I tell her I don't mind trying again and that we might as well while I'm here. She tries using a different tourniquet that she ""likes better"" but still no luck. I laugh and tell her next time I'll bring in my friend who can miraculously hit me on the first try without me even feeling it.

I have never been able to talk about any of this with anyone, and I am having a hard time finding words and giving myself permission to let my guard down. I have deleted several paragraphs already, re-reading them and thinking “there is no way anyone will believe this,” or, “I can’t say that, it will only hurt whoever’s reading this.” And that is my first inclination: to protect myself and others, from myself. 

I am chronically depressed. I have a chronic heroin addiction. I am chronically incapable of telling anyone about what really happens in my head, and so I have stayed chronically mentally unwell. I have hidden myself so well and for so long that the truth feels overly dramatic and self-serving and completely unbelievable. But I have this funny feeling that something is going to happen soon and I am going to die, and I am at peace with that, and there are those who need to understand why. 

All of the darkness has stayed inside of me and there isn’t any room left. I don’t know where it came from. I sometimes feel that I can’t find even one memory that isn’t tinged with loneliness, or fear, or shadows. All of them whirling inside of me and turning into hate, and loathing, and anger—towards myself. I was—I am—so afraid of what might happen if I lose control, if I am no longer able to contain it, to internalize it, to hold it in. Terrified of giving in to my compulsions of self-harm. I am my own worst enemy, and half of me battles the other, and I am in the middle, and I am not winning this war. 

I can remember feeling this when I was less than 10 years old. 

And now, years later, I am still lonely and afraid and I have no self-esteem and I alternate between intense feelings of self-loathing, and self-pity. There is screaming in my head and sometimes the need to hurt myself is so intense that I can barely keep myself from giving in. I have visions of my body bashing itself in and shredding its own skin, and I am only partly horrified.

Drugs, for me, have been the only source of comfort, and they will most likely kill me. I can barely drag myself out of bed in the morning, or afternoon, or sometimes evening, if I am sober. I have nothing to look forward to but pain and misery (and yes, I know this sounds melodramatic and ridiculous). I literally cannot leave the house unless I have to, because I’m so anxious and depressed. I am in such a deep, dark hole and I do not have the skills or motivation to do anything about it. So why not get high? Why not get drunk? Why not stay up all night shooting heroin, always half a grain away from an OD? I have lost the energy to give a shit. What a waste of intelligence, of strength, of heart. I could have been a great addition to the world. ",1429916405.0

It started when I was 16 and I found my mom's oxycontin. I had no idea what opiates where but I was just knew I should take them (at the point in time I would have some drinks at highschool parties and smoke a little weed here and there though I never cared much for it cause it made me paranoid). I took the OCs and that was the end of it, until I turned 18 and started a 5 year daily heroin binge. I got clean from that, and that lasted two years until I relapsed. I wanted to stop the heroin use and try to get clean. I discovered Poppy Seed Tea, and figured I could use that to tapper off. Of course that didn't happen and I used PST daily for a year and a half, that is until I discovered that my source has abruptly stopped carrying the seeds. Well at this point I figure the jigs up and I am exhausted from it all anyways. In the end I was using 3.5 lb batches and wasn't feeling anything, just preventing withdrawals and I did that for 5 months.


Now I have tried every withdrawal remedy out there. None have done the trick in my opinion. The only thing that came close was a special blend called Elimidrol, but it is super expensive.


I am 8 days clean now, and I have not felt a single withdrawal symptom. This is how I did it:



First loperamide. A lot of people say it doesn't work, my body says other wise. I took 50 mg of the 2 mg tablets (it's a fucking mouth full). That right there kills off the aches and restless legs etc.



Next up is colanzepam. This may be risky business for some users, because it could lead to trading one drug for another. For me, I fucking hate the feeling of benzos. That said, it totally eliminates the hopelessness and anxiety and awful psychological feelings, and even aides in the aches and restless legs. I take half in the morning and half at night for sleep. I got my hands on just enough to get through the withdrawals and have no way to get more.



Gatorade. Keep your ass hydrated with electrolytes.


Like I said, I am eight days clean. I stopped taking all this stuff on the 6th day. Like I said I am on the 8th day. I have energy. I feel good. I still have a mental tick here and there, but this has been the easiest and in my opinion most successful way I have gotten through the dreaded withdrawals, and I have gone through countless withdrawals.




Disclaimer: for those with an affinity for benzos, this method may not be for you. Trading one drug for another is not the point of this but rather it is designed to help those who it is applicable to.








I really just hope this helps some one the way it helped me.

He has done opiates in the past but said he hasn't used in about 3 days (he doesn't get sick). I gave him maybe 50-100mg of #4 H. He IV'd half then said he wanted to do the rest. He does the rest and goes into a room with his girlfriend. All the sudden she starts screaming me name. So I go in there he isn't responsive and he was breathing maybe 3 times a minute. Hos lips were blue. So I call 911. I tell them that I found him like that, unconscious and not breathing. The paramedics arrived and I told them he had done too much heroin. By this time he was more alert and able to answer questions. They did not give him narcan. I feel awful for giving him that much and telling him to do other half. I wish I had some narcan to give him. Luckily the police did not get involved, but I do live in a state that has ""good samaritan"" laws, that make you immune to drug related crimes (unless you're selling). Anyways just a wake up call for me and everyone else that when you do a substance or give it to anyone else, tell then to wait at least 30 minutes to an hour after you dose to wait to redose.

this is mostly while KNOWING i have a drug test this next coming monday, exactly 72 hours after my last dose. call me an idiot if you will(i already know i am), but this addiction has been damn hard to overcome, and i really am trying my best.. ive got some subs to keep me okay through withdrawals, but im still VERY worried about this drug screen.

its a 10panel(?), NOT sent to a lab. its a little clinic nearby that handles drug tests for the court.. anywho.. im planning to drink an ass ton of water until monday. take B12 vitamins monday morning, and make sure i only put my mid stream into the cup.

IN YOUR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, has this worked for you? am i completely fucked? whats the chance i will pass with this method?

from what i read, 72 hours is obviously cutting it super close for my level of use. i figure i have a about a 50/50 chance of passing if everything is in its ideal condition.

any advice greatly appreciated.. thanks!

So our little corner of the city was suddenly overrun with tie dye refugees.  The park was filled with tents and every inch of city parking had a VW bus, van or crappy car illegally parked in it.  The little Mexican grocery store where I bought my morning tortilla, beans and eggs was filled with spacey people.  The smell of unwashed pubic hair, patchouli and sage smoke overpowered the Mission.  Señor Noe had to police his store.  Lucky for the hippies Noe was a mellow stoner unlike some of his vicious gang banging cousins.  

Noe catches a chick smuggling out handfuls of dog food in her pocket and he stops her, trades her the dog food for weed and a shiny Steal Your Face sticker.  Mushrooms for Pepsi and a 40oz of Olde English.  Free burritos for a promise the Rainbow Family members will not only stop stealing shit - but actually police the store.  Agreements are made, hands are shaken and at the end of the day Señor Noe is high as fuck on Snoopy acid wearing a t-shirt that says Air Garcia. His last name is Garcia so he thinks this is as funny as hell. 

Not all our neighbors agree but I love the influx of weirdos.  I feel like them everyday when I'm high on pills, lines or inhaling smoke trails of black tar.  Like this: What?  Huh?  Trippy...Heeeyy...Yeah...Oh yeah man!  Ha ha!  Whaaaat...?

Exactly.

But after the gypsy vanguard arrives soon come the suburban hippies.  They come for the party and merchandise.  Everyone following knows this and rolls out the tie-dyed red carpet.  Come all ye high school stoner kids or Pink Floyd college dudes.  Drugs, fashions, vegan cuisine...everything for a price.  Oh and the Grateful Dead are playing too.  Wear your new t-shirt, wave your freak flag, eat some microdots and smoke some buddha.  And spend, spend, spend!

Jason hates the invasion.

""Its like my parents are skull fucking me"", he muses after a bong hit from a Rainbow Family lady that makes excellent vegetarian lasagne.  She nods sympathetically and counts his money for the bags of peyote buttons he is buying.  
""Organic?"", Jason asks.

""Sure"", shrugs the hippie lady.

But Jason also likes money.  Sure the deadheads have their own economy but the suburban kids have nothing but cash and dreams.  So we pool our money to Jason who buys 5 ounces of bud.  Mendocino skunk weed so definitely above the Mexican brown weed bricks that circulate through the city...but more expensive.  A top shelf niche product he brags.  The older hippies appreciate this and the suburban kids are tired of Mexican brown weed.

We sat on the sidewalk between a head shop and an Italian cafe across from the park.  From our spot we could see bongo circles and illegal venue tents.  So when the tourist suburban kids left the park to get some coffee, food or visit a headshop - There we are.  Slinging weed.  $45 for 8ths and $15 for dimes.  

 Kym and I were nodding but Jason insisted we keep doing coke to stay humming for business.  And we were doing good.  Hell great.  Only Jason wore a tie dye because Kym refused (""I don't wear clothes that make me look fat or stupid"") and I did not get the hippie memo as I came from my chemistry lecture on Fractional Distillation.  But the deadheads noticed.  Hell, they were buying us out.  They bartered and spent cash.  Never mind the summer of love - many of them had heroin or coke too and so we traded.  Good H too.  Obviously they were in on the biker gang heroin trade which was pricey but better than the Mexican shit.  The deadheads loved local connects and sat with us to torment the suburb kids.  We all did a lot of acid.  A LOT of acid.  Too much acid...Like wow man.

The geometry of psychedelic love HALTED my nod.  Suddenly I was staring at architecture and my brain was firing.  I took out my HP 48 calculator (20 bit processor), my graph paper notebook and started contemplating angles.  

I finished my homework as Kym and Jason enjoyed themselves and ripped off high school kids.  Cocaine is a wonderful drug but in the hands of jerks selling weed to suburban mall kids you get shit like:

Kym: Hey handsome!  Love your shirt!  Did you mom buy it for you?

Kid: Thank you!  Uhm...no.  Hey do you guys know where we can buy some weed?

Kym: No.  Do you have any naked pictures of your mom?

Kid: Huh...what?  No....

Kym: Would you like to buy some?

Jason: Haha!  Funny!  Weed?  Why yes!  Yes we do.  Ohh...wait maybe we are out.  Hey!  (pokes me)- Any weed left?

Me: Almost out man...but it's the Mendocino.

Jason: What?  Mendocino?  Really?  Fuck I need those for my friends...sorry guys.  All out.

Kid:  What?  But c'mon!  We have money!

Jason:  Yeah but this is Mendocino!  You try this shit?  No?  Well it is off the charts...Pricey

Kid:  How much?

Jason:  Mendocino?  Shit way beyond you guys.  Its $60 an 8th...

Kid:  We have that.  Can we buy it?

2 days later when the acid started to wear off Kym pointed out we had all this heroin left.  Our usual Bell Curve weekend usage model was abnormally tweaked.  This Jerry Garcia effect was noted and filed away.  Soon the old habits filled in again and the scent of incense sandalwood faded.  When my depth perception returned and I stopped seeing trails off of everything I dipped back into the opiates with a vengeance.  But the Dead will return in summer.  We can all make some money and take another break.

Of course, that would seemingly make no sense.  I know there are (or are going to be) ER formulations with naloxone in them.

Finally they re-up and now I'm faced with a new problem. I work at 5am(get picked up at 5am) and I've been shooting a whole point as of late, such a better rush and I'm not using too much water anymore. 

I used to be fine with half a point at a time, but it got to the point where I'd shoot half a point and then shoot another half a point like an hour or 2 later, WHY? just to be high longer ...I guess. But after shooting a full point a few times OH GOD THAT RUSH. as of late the stuff has been really, really good. As I said ""turn off the ringer-good"" fucking revel in the rush good. 

So in a way I want to wait until 4am, then shoot a full point and get picked up at 5am. But I'm torn....feel like shooting MOST of a point now and shooting just a little just before my ride comes and taking the lope with me to work(more of a security blaket than anything. 

I will admit the relief of just knowing I have dope(and lope..that I wont need thank fuck) puts me at greater ease. 

ANYWAY, THE FUCKING WAITING IS THE HARDEST PART. I have all this good TV to catch up on and I just want to jump to ""Real Time"" and shoot up. 

What's worse, waiting for dope in the first place or waiting to take a dose cause you know you need to space it out? 

Hope you're all enjoying your night. I shot a point at 5pm, and it's now 10:30pm. It will be oh so much better if I wait till like 3-4am to use...I know it. But part of me says...no no, shoot half now half later....

But I am going to try and wait it out, and I'm giving myself an hour to enjoy my high before my ride comes. I'm a light user(I think) so I can shoot this and make it thru 5-8 hours of work. And I have no bills and shit to pay so I'm getting $100 worth of dope after work, and it's been this bright white super strong shit as of late. They said ""the pieces will be bigger cause we kept everyone waiting"" when he said that I was pretty high cause I saved a piece from yesterday,  lol 

And he was right, this point looks so fucking good.

I NEVER, a day in my life, have ever had to ""fuck the plug"" and I've never been treated with the utmost respect from my men, and always get more free shit than anybody else around. Now of course they all WANT to fuck me, and I'm not saying I don't let them think what they want, but to physically lay down with someone just for drugs or money? Never. My fiancee and I are both attractive, she's an amazing dancer (stripper), and they all want her just as bad, sometimes worse, than they want me too. But she too has never had to be made to feel uncomfortable or let a grab slip here and there for ANYTHING. And the fact those three things may make it easier for us, but we don't even have to really try? 
Can anyone tell me why this is?! I mean it literally never fails that we walk into a house and the actual dealer or dealers will come straight to where we are, or we go straight to them, to hang out while everyone else is forced to the basement to do their shit lol? And why do all of their girlfriends always have to hate us whenever were the last (mostly only) girls around that AREN'T fucking their dudes...? We are very blatantly together, both very obvious lesbians. (My fiancee wasn't always, I kind of turned her out, I was the first and only girl she had feelings for. Since then, five years ago, during our only one month from each other, she only got interested in girls)

We both can ask my main dope boys for anything. For food, for money, a place to stay, fronts, free drugs, dinner (totally free), a night out at the club (totally free), an-y-thing, and never be turned down. It's so nice and I just wanted to voice all of this as I sit here and witness all these other people being treated like dogs, since I would never say this shit to the people around me. Mostly because, I don't need to. But also because I'm not that type of rude person..anymore.",1430018494.0

I used to be real big into smoking crack, and I still do every now and then. Every time I inject coke I am very underwhelmed. I have injected coke and then cooked up and smoked the same batch of coke and smoking gave me a much better rush than shooting the same coke did. I know the coke is pretty good because of how it cooks up and smokes. When I prep it for a shot I just throw it in some water, stir it up really good and draw up and shoot it. I have tried heating it a little bit as well with the same results. I have done a pretty good amount at once too, much more than I would need if I cooked it up and smoked it instead, and I just don't get that good of a rush from it. I have yet to experience a bell ringer from shooting it where I have gotten them from smoking it many many times.  Does anyone know why I am not getting that great of rushes from shooting it? It doesn't seem to make sense to me especially if I can cook and smoke the same coke with much better results. I don't understand why it wouldn't be blowing my fucking head open if I am doing more than enough, it just doesn't make sense to me. I feel it and can taste the coke in the back of my throat, but it's not nearly as intense as smoking crack is for me.",1430018223.0

i have recently got some quality Heroin #3 via the deep web.

Snorting it gives a little buzz / clear high. maybe my dosage is not enough? i put always some little creamish orange/brownish poiints on my finger and up to my nose.

anyways, lets come to the main point.

is my #3 heroin smokable? i dont like the chasing the dragon tinfoil/method and will def do it in my meth pipe.

so i put some little rocks into my pipe, added a bit water and caffeine (small amount). read that i have to do that. now all i noticed was smoke buzzzling and i took a shit.

Ok, so for most of this week I was in the hospital for a chronic disease issue (crohns). They know I get dilaudid scripts from my pain management doctor that is currently at 3 4mg pills a day. I told them I was still hurting, so they were generous and were giving me 4mg pill every four hours. I couldn't tell them that I take up to 12 a day and run out early most weeks. So they thought they were being super cool. Thursday afternoon they put on a 75mcg fentanyl patch (no the gel kind, damn) as my whole body was in pain on top of my monstrous temp. So I get sent home the following day. Apparently all that pain and high temperatures was due to a bacterial infection...I need a break...

**story time**
OK so after getting discharged I get home and from 4:30 pm to 10:00 pm I bang through 10 4mg dillies. I also took 8 benedryls during that time frame, I swallow the first 2 while mixing 1 benedryl in a 4mg shot of dilly. Closer to 10pm and I just just want to sleep. I had an awful roommate and slept maybe 4 hours during my 5 day stay. So I prep an 8mg shot with 1 benedryl in it, and took 4 more orally. The next thing I know is I wake up on the sofa, vaguely remembering a few dreams that were all over the place. In one I check my backyard after hearing a weird noises, I turn the corner to walk down the side of the house. I then see 8-10 alligators just chilling there. I remember running and that's it. Another dream has my parents out of the country for a week. I get home from the hospital and I'm locked out of the house, the garage door beeper isn't working, the gate to the back door is wired shut from behind, and none of the windows are opened. Then because its a dream, bam, I'm inside the home and grabbing my spare key to hide outside in case that ever happens again. So after waking up around 8 I go for a quick walk and think about what I have to do. So after cleaning a bit its close to lunch time and I decide that Chik Fil A chicken nugs sound really really good. So I get dressed and soon realized my keys aren't on the bar in the kitchen where I left them last night. Its literally a carabiner with my house key, key fob, and regular car key on it. After looking for about 30 minutes i start getting really angry while also realizing I haven't seen my new plain white mesh fitted ball cap is. I sit on the couch an go through what I did the previous night step by step, and still nothing. I then I actually start talking out loud to myself while kind of laughing and also calling myself a frigging moron.  I go back to my dreams. The first one I remember vaguely includes me being locked out of the house, and my parents being out of the country for a few days. My parents are actually out on some lake out of the state with some of their friends right now. The reason why I am a moron? well I go out the front door and lift up my step dads rock that says ""welcome"" or something like that in Hebrew. I just start laughing in disbelief as I see my carabiner with my key fob, house key, and regular car key. apparently I was so far gone that a lot of what I thought were dreams, were things I actually was doing. So me walking around the side of my house in just boxer briefs, yea that wasn't a dream. In another dream I was enjoying watching the sun come up from our patio furniture. It was about 69 degrees out and we keep our a/c at 72 so I went around opening a few windows and leaving the sliding glass door open. So when I woke up this am and saw that my sliding glass door was wide open I almost called the cops. I guess I had already woken up around 6 or 6:30 and the dream about me watching the sun come up and opening windows and such was not a dream at all, it really did happen in the last hour or two.

I have had experiences where I have nodded off for a few seconds here and there, but this shit takes the damn cake for me. I had actually forgot that i was wearing that 75mcg fentanyl patch as well, meaning it still had 48 hours or so until it ""runs out"". So after today I'm NEVER going to mix up stuff like I did last night. I had taken so much benedryl on top of banging 40+ mgs of dilaudid, and a fentanyl patch, that I was just a little opiate zombie. It scares me that I can walk around and function like that. I was also wondering why a framed picture of my mom and my three nieces was lying on my floor? well as I was just typing a few sentences back I noticed a frame hook all by its lonesome. Apparently I went into my moms office, took the framed photo down and put it in my room.

Wow...I need to take it down a notch or two.                                         ",1429985139.0

I'm in my early twenties, messed with oxy twice then heroin around 17. I was extremely depressed/extremely anxious. I lost all hope and opiates gave me the tool to safe medicate.

Over the past 5 years, I have been using heroin pretty regularly on and off, however. I did have long periods of clean time although I thought about it regularly. I have been on suboxone maintenance for a while. 

Last Fall, I had a huge relapse. My longest period of clean-time (8 months) I broke-down and caved in, not out of depression this time, but out of boredom. I was sick of the status quo of things. 

I started using heroin daily for a few months till my family found out. I have had about 10-20 relapses since. devastating them each time whether I tell them, or I let them know. I used to be very open with them about it and help them understand, it terrified them even more lol. 

Anyways, I went into a detox, relapsed shortly after, then went to IOP. At the IOP, they drug-tested me regularly and I got discharged for some bullshit unrelated to opiates... but anyways hydromorphone and codeine metabolites were in my system 5 days after heroin use which is pretty fucking insane if you ask me. It is like the GC-MS sort of test where they can pick out what kind of opiate you took and the levels of the metabolites...

So the addict in me decided to buy something called butyr-fentanyl, a dangerous analogue of fentanyl, in order to not let it show on a urine screen... Man this shit was addicting and I recommend nobody try it... my tolerance is fucked. I went through 3 grams in less than a month smoked just recently... I started at <1mg doses, then gradually started smoking 3-5mg every 5-30 minutes at a time. I would go through like 100-150mg in a day... it was bad. My tolerance was off the charts and some days I really wondered if I was alive or dead... I have never overdosed.. but it frightens me that I take those doses to feel a sense of normal or some euphoria.

 After I ran out, I decided to call it quits. I couldn't live like this anymore. However, I was able to get in touch with 130mg of fentanyl citrate... pure powder. Not tested, but after snorting 1mg the first time I knew it was the real thing cause I woke up nodding out... No euphoria at all... just the opiate feeling without the lovely feeling. I went through that in FIVE FUCKING DAYS. This was right after the butyr-fentanyl run. I don't understand. I was expecting it to last at least a month, seeing how fentanyl doses are in like the 100-200 microgram range and I had over 100 milligrams of it. I ran out of that last friday, and took some sub few hours later... put me straight into some nasty w/d and was kicking and RLS. I never experienced horrid withdrawal but this was bad. The next day, I woke up in a pool of sweat. But right now, I somehow feel somewhat okay now, day 2-3ish without any opiate agonist... just suboxone, xanax, and some vitamins... I don't understand. I hope the withdrawal has passed, I am guessing due to the short half-life nature of fentanyl and the fentanyl analogues it went away quick... but still... yuck... I hope I'm over the worst of it.

I don't IV, only snort/smoke, but I was starting to consider it. Now the question is, do I go out looking for more or end my cycle now? It was not worth it in my opinion. I was dosing every hour at the bare minimum to feel well because the duration was so short. I was never into fentanyl, the idea disgusted me, until I found out I was required to get drug tested randomly and found an escape route to prevent getting caught pissing dirty. it wasn't worth it. I would rate heroin much better.

For now I don't crave, but I know I will and I'm terrified when that will be. My dealers are everywhere I turn... and it's getting harder to hide this habit. Anyways... I just thought I'd share my story. And hopefully I won't relapse. It is hurting the people that love me much more than myself and that's the worst. I'm still depressed. I'm still unhappy. I hope this changes.",1430107301.0

So today I was on 40mg of Adderall; I took that around 11am. Then I had a bunch of caffeine. Around 6pm, I did a TINY bump of heroin. I just got this stuff today and have never tried it before. I was told that it was very strong, and I have no tolerance at the moment. 

A few minutes after taking the bump, my heart rate shot up to 140. It has been a couple of hours and it's still over 100. I know this stuff works because my pupils are tiny and I can kind of feel it, but I feel like the stimulants are overpowering the heroin right now and I feel really stimulated. Maybe it's cut with something that increases heart rate? Or is it the combination of uppers and downers? I have honestly been destroying my body with stimulants lately. Still, I was surprised that this happened today since I did the H like 7 hours after the stims. I assume that taking more would just cause me to die or something, but I wish I could because I feel really on edge right now.

Any insight/help/conversation would be cool.
Thanks guys. ",1430105862.0

Trying to cold cop in the burbs,PANIC, the wrong shit, ask for DOPE GET FENT and SO ON WTF 0_0(WARNING, long read, and I'm dead tired cause I couldn 't sleep before work)","This isn't a great story, just a series of fucked up events. With hopefully a happy ending and two new connections?

So... my regular guys seem to have their phone disconnected again...just when I've worked all fucking day and I'm going to just one point under a fucking gram! 

The FIRST GUY IS SEE WHEN HUNTING FOR THE MAIN GUY ON THE CRE I KNOW , call him K. I ask him , you know K. NO. He has fent. He can get dope tho, ""just around the corner""

I'm starting with $160, worked all day, HARD and really want to keep my money. But I risk $40 for just 2 points instead of 3 for 50$. I panic, feel like the guy isn't comig back and I've now ""bought"" his ugly and dirty hoodie and pants. He actually comes back. Wants a clean rig. Suddenly we're up in my apt, he says ""I'll smack you if you do the whole thing"" one shot of some of the fent. but it's so little and I've had nothing all day. I assume it's  not going to work like the last (and only other time I did fent, purely cause I couldn't get anything) nope, it hits hard. I did some more just a bit ago and that hit hard too. I'm glad and I'm not back down to earth right away like I feared. But it's the ""crack"" of opioids like people say...but they're right, I'm kinda high and the rush was strong and short...but it's not nearly as good as down. 

So...later I go out looking for my guy again. Their phone is off but if I find K...maybe I can pick up. I ask another guy who looks ""cool"" if he knows K. NOPE. But he's ""about to get a half ball of speed anyway"" and he knows and older lady ""in the tower"" but then he goes to the building beside my place? and gets me to wait across the street. I wait, and wait, and watch him. Finally I panic, and think he's got his own money taking back mine changes nothing. right?

""I'm about to go in""
""Sorry man I want to wait for K, or ask my friend who lives in poco(town over) or an older dude I know...I'll give you a 20 bag just for your trouble, take my number""

He hands me back $40, ""no man I gave you $60""
""Opps"" he says as he fucking rips my bill, thankfully not the serial number. 

I just didn't want to risk it being low quality, plus I don't get to mee the lady?

The first guy was on speed for 7 days, and he gave me barely anything but I got 2-3 good shots(got one more) out of it but tho this time I got fent that actually worked I really just want down. And I know he took more than he said and gave me less than 2 points.

KEEP IN MIND, I asked for DOWN and said I would give him a clean rig, hash for his trouble AND free weed in the future when it's dry. and he comes back with his DOC ""sorry there was only fent"" after I told him ONLY GET DOWN or NOTHING. 

The second guy seemed more down to earth but I was so tired and high and was thinkin what am I doing...I know a guy who I sell TONS of HASH to who seems like he's into more than pot, he's an older guy and worth asking, and I've already pissed away $40 on a small questionable amount of SOMETHING I DIDN'T EVEN WANT. So as much as I kinda feel bad about the second guy I panicked, and I'm glad I did. Now I still have my $120, not just $60

I have a friend who has massive hookups. He's been a dealer for big time guys before, I've seen bricks of coke at his place, a freezer full of GHB etc.

So I ask him. But I'd have to take the bus out of town if I want down. So I've got him working on finding me a new connection...I'm in the burbs of Vancouver and I don't want to go downtown if I don't have to.

The old guy I sold over $100 in hash to recently(gave him a smoking deal , well over $100 worth hash $20 quarter ozs) is MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP ME, and I'm going to give him a ""4 gram 1/8th"" 4 grams basically :P when our weed is dry and I get paid some, and he's going to BRING ME TO AN ACTUAL DOPE HOUSE when I call him after a shower.

I really hope this works out, I'm going to get 3 points for $50, same thing I was going to get with the second guy but I was unsure of him cause I just didn't want to take the risk with someone I don't know who's leaving me outside, and he wanted half a point...not bad for a middleman but WHY was he so angry? if he's got his own money for all this speed what does me backing out change exactly?

I'm going with the friendly old hippie I sell hash to, he - right from the start was fine with introducing me to someone, just asked if I still had some hash and I volunteeered giving him weed for an introduction and said I'd give him hash but I gave the first speed head hash. 

FUCK. Two speed heads. One that gave me barely any fent when I asked for 2 points of down, then tells me about ESP, ""new tvs and their signals"" how he can't work cause  he ""was seeing faces that we're not there"" and so on. 

It's been a rough, fucked up evening. 

Hope you're all having a good night. 
I'm going to have a quick shower then go try and find a new dope connection. I really just wish my guys had their phone on. When I go to buy the biggest bags, this often happens, days later the phone is working. It's no busy it's giving a disconnected signal of some kind.

It is a fentanyl analogue commonly known as **Butyr-Fentanyl** (N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylbutyramide) that is around *¼ potency* of **Fentanyl** (N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylpropanamide)

Fentanyl is EXTREMELY potent, and users with no opiate tolerance should stay away from it and its analogues. 

Now onto the experience. 500mg of Butyr-Fentanyl powder was obtained through a RC group for research purposes only. Because BF is active in the 250microgram to 1mg range, the common way to prepare BF is to use a solvent such as Propylene Glycol, Water, or Alcohol to better measure out doses as opposed to eyeballing a jar of powder. 

>60mg BF powder was weighed out and mixed into 30 milliliters of 100% propylene glycol, rendering a 2mg/ml solution. This preparation method allows for exact dosing orally, sublingually, or on a RDA vape. Each of these methods is somewhat effective, sublingual probably being the most effective. 

Another method I experimented with, was to weigh out 10mg of BF, and split it into 5 evenly sized piles. THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A TOLERANCE TO OPIATES. If you get floored off of 20mg Hydrocodone, this drug is not for you. But insufflating 2mgs (which is a very small pile of the powder) renders a wonderfully euphoric 2 hours with a satisfying onset of about 2 minutes. 

**AGAIN.** 

The danger of this substance must be stressed. If you don't own proper equipment (scales, solvents, syringes for measurements, etc.) or you are not experienced with opiates **PLEASE** do **not** attempt any type of preparations with Butyr-Fentanyl, or its cousin Acetyl-Fentanyl.

So opiates/H have caught up fast with me.  It all started Dec.1st 2014 when I HARDCORE broke my ankle.  The hospital introduced me to the beautiful side of opiates.  For the 5 days I was in the hospital I was allowed to request IV dilaudid every 4 hours.  I set my alarm every 4 hours to get as much as I could.  Sent me home(to my parents house for rehab) with TONS of Percocets and low dose Oxycontin but it was ER not IR.  At first 15-20mg of the percs would shoot me into AN amazing buzz.  My tolerance grew rapidly to the point I needed 10 pills(i used CWE) to get that desired high I was after.  So as I got better and my pain pills were slowly dwindling I decided I didnt want to quit opiates at that time.  This is when I decided to give H a try.  And I loved it!!  Ive done most any drugs in my lifetime but at the point of this I was only smoking herb.  H seemed so cheap at the time when 2 points at 10 a piece was plenty for a whole day, and I sniff only.  Well fast forward a couple months and I do about 10 bags a day and spend about $100 per day.  This drug just makes me not care about all of my problems.  Well that kind of habit is hard to maintain.  Me and my hookup discussed the benifits of methadone over Subs.  Well I got some surprise money that I had been owed for years.  So pictured here is my last dance with what I love sooo much.

After these bags are gone the next morning I am headed to a methadone clinic.  Which is going to suck because you have to go every single day and just in general shitty.

In the bags are 15 points(pills) of some quality H.  The guy puts his stuff in pills for some reason, but the stuff is great.
14.5 one milligram Klonipin, and 11 Ambien 5mg.  So it will be a fun day or two but then reality is going to smack me right in the face and I dont look forward to it.  Man I hope this methadone stuff is easy to get your mind and body used to!!  I am very nervous about the methadone for some reason.",1430200674.0

344dch,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/344dch/robbed/,20,https://redd.it/344dch,morbo2000,Robbed,"BOOM.  

A far away sound.

BOOM.

I have that falling sensation.  Plunging through darkness......and jerked awake with a gasp.  I groan as oxygen struggles to fit into my bloodstream through the massive, hazy drug induced weight.  This toxic fuzziness crushes me.  I'm weak and helpless.  Like a worm.  And like a worm, I struggle forward.  Around me is the blurry scene.  Some sort of fucking junkie hovel.  

BOOM.

That sound again godamnit!  

BOOM.

I struggle across the stained carpet over cigarette ash, toenails, crumbs and fast food wrappers that still reek of burger grease.  I pause near a coffee table covered with empty beer cans, pizza boxes and a pile of half eaten donuts.  Garbage is everywhere.  Ashtrays filled with stale beer and butts, cigarette burns on the furniture and tables.  The only area clear of trash is where people did drugs.  2 burnt spoons, some torn baggies, discarded needles and toilet paper wads spotted with blood.  

BOOM.

Is someone knocking?  Whats wrong with my senses?  Everything comes from another dimension.

BOOM.

Empty prescription pill containers and cough syrup bottles cover the couch.  The curtains are shut and the only source of light is the TV.  I stare at bare chested males and girls in tiny bikinis cavorting on a beach in front of some white rapper who hops up and down like a fucking frog.  What is this shit...

BOOM.

I look up right as the door explodes inward.  Instinctively I fall to the floor as 2 men burst in with guns.  One spots me and bellows so I freeze while the other lunges past me and kicks open the bathroom door.  ""Clear!"", he yells.  More men pour in with more guns.  I find myself face down in the burger wrappers unable to move.

""Any weapons?  Needles?  Drugs?"", says a man going through my pockets.

I shake my head and say No.  I feel sick.  I feel fear.  These men are policemen.  As my rights are read I start to think about jail and suddenly have to puke or shit.  Maybe both.  

""Can I please go to the bathroom?"", I ask.

""Just sit tight"", says the guy searching me.  I hear my name come back over his radio.  Another man walks in and they look at me.

I sit on the couch while the guy who searched me pulls out a notebook.  I have my first clear view of the room.  It's a motel room that has been trashed by junkies.  I am shocked.  Not one damn thing looks familiar.  A complete blank spot in my memory.

""My name is Detective Tom Loren.  Can you tell me about Shane Pedergrass or Shelly Kowalski?""

""I don't know who they are...wait the biker couple?""

""Yeah them.  We're looking for Shane.  Can you tell me anything about Mr. Pedergrass?  Where he is?""

""Uh, you know I have no idea where I am or-""

""Kid!"", says the other cop staring at me, ""We could take you to the station and let you sit in general custody for a couple of days but all we want is some cooperation.""

""But I swear I have no idea who they are!  Really.  I was partying with these guys-""

""What guys?  Where?""

Fuck.  I had never been in trouble before.  Not like this.  The shitty part was I am telling the truth.  I have no idea where I am.  Everything is a blur of meth and heroin and probably other toxins as well.  This hangover is like sand filling my skull, weighing it down and wiping all thoughts clean.  I can feel new holes in my arms.  Tiny, angry bruises.  Did I do this?  Fuck, were the needles shared?  

Cops walk around the filthy room collecting receipts and poking through the trash.  Finally they let me go puke but I have to keep the door open.  After another hour they get ready to leave.  I stand there unsure.  What's happening?  My heart pounds.  I'm still handcuffed.  I felt like I was going to shit myself or puke again.  They stare at me as if deciding my fate.

""You're friends are dicks"", says the detective as he puts his coat on.  Then he turns me around and uncuffs me.

This was not what I imagined would happen.

""Excuse me?""

""They pulled a runner asshole"", chimes in another cop.  

""We get these calls a lot"", shrugs Detective Tom Loren, ""Junkies party for a couple days and sneak out.  They think its funny to leave some jackass behind to pay the bill.  Looks like you.""

I open my wallet, ""Hey!  I've been robbed!""

""Yeah that's usually part of it too"", grins the cop.      ",1430197564.0

I'm a normal 27 yr old guy with a normal desk job and just a bit of a habit. I make decent money so supplying my $150/day habit isn't much of a problem. So my dealer (Let's call him C) knows I pick up a lot every day so today he throws me extra. So I have a few friends who dabble in the boy also so I decided to hook them up for cheap and not make any profit just my money back that I spent. So driving home from making a drop I saw a elderly homeless lady standing In front of a McDonald's with a bunch of bags and torn clothes. So I decided to pull in and to do something nice and ask her if I could buy her some food. She accepted my offer and almost cried that someone of my stature was so generous (27, tattooed, gauged ears, shaved head, stereo-typed a lot). So I took her inside and bought her what ever she wanted, she got 2 chicken sandwiches, an apple pie, and a vanilla milk shake, sat down with her and listened to her story. She was a navy Vet who just fell into some bad luck after her husband died and lost everything cuz of her disability. So after about an hour of talking to her I had some other things to do so as I was walking out side with her she asked me for a cigarette. Handed her the rest of my pack of smokes and a 100 dollar bill. Now this time she almost started crying and thanked me up and down and had the biggest smile. She asked what she could do to repay me and I just told her to pay it forward and make someone smile today. Moral is People like us are normal people who do good deeds sometimes. It's just a bad wrap cuz of what we're into. Sorry for the wall of text just thought a happy story could brighten some days. Happy Nods!

I made a lot of progress in being able to walk again (broke 18 bones, 7 surgeries, ruptured organs) and when I visited the pain specialist in Oregon he just referred me books and a group therapy. I've been on a steady taper and currently am at 93 5mg oxys every two weeks.

The dose isn't working for me and I'm not able to walk and back in the chair. He kept reiterating ""these medications will fail you, and we need to prepare for when they do"" essentially he won't give any additional medication even though I desperately would like to really walk again. I've done all the routes outside of pills to accommodate my pain. I have an appointment in Washington this time on Wednesday hoping they are more lenient in that state, all I know about the doctor is he is soon to retire. 

I am on a contact and I just need more medication to be able to walk. I asked about alternatives with medication and all he gave me was books. I'd be interested in nonopiods as well such as tramadol. 

What do I need to say or do to get the proper dose of medication without just being given books and group therapy. Also between the two states which is more strict with their opioid laws? 

Should I just keep trying different pain specialists until I find one who is willing to prescribe? Emergency care? Try to sway my stern primary care physician?

Im not using these recreationally, I just want to live a normal life like I was just a couple months ago.

Looking for some advice about entering a part of this community I'm not familiar with. I know it's long but please take a sec & read.","Today I may have done something stupid. When I woke up, I was just expecting some etizolam in the mail. Which doesn't really do anything. Or at least it doesn't feel like that. So after a while I find out I can get 8 hydro 10/325 for free for helping out a buddy before. When I get home I realize there's a 10mg Ritalin too. Psyched, I just down them all, & this is including the 6- 1mg etizolam.  Now I normally have a high tolerance to Ritalin & hydros, but not combined with that much etizolam. I honestly thought the etizolam was all I was getting today. 

Now, I wanna make the most of today. Bc idk how long I've got to wait before I can score anymore. (I'm a girl in her 20s in a new city & I've never had to do anything like cold cop so im scared about all of that. 

My question though is, am I going to be alright, mixing all of that? I've got 4 more 1mg of etizolam. I wanted to save some for the next day but if i get the chance to have a straight up awesome day, I take it. I'm sure this sounds newbie, but I assure you I'm not new to opaites or benzos. Just because I don't post doesn't mean I'm not here. I'm just always worried about people finding out to much about me & will take advantage of that. 

Anyways, I know yall are an awesome community & are usually into helping new posters. So if you could help me, give me advice, I'd really appreciate if.

I used to just get my drugs from Drs, bc I do have conditions that warrant these. But with living in a new town plus being broke & all, i usually get laughed at when they see my medical history from a dr I've had for years. So I guess it's time for me to take this to the street. & you guys seem like the good crowd to turn to for such things. 

Sorry for the typo, typing fast already lol. If anyone has any questions, if I can ask this, could you post them on here? That way if it's not appropriate & I don't understand, make others could help us out. Or you could PM me, I just need someone that understands this to hell or give advice. Nobody know what I do.

They gave me a 1mg shot of dilaudid in the ass, amazingly enough, and 15 7.5/200 hydrocodone/ibuprophen. This didn't even hurt that badly.

Anyone else do this before?,"Hey guys. Fairly long time opiate user(for my age lol). I started light when I was like 15, used more and more(on and off though, sometimes i'd be high for a week straight and then not touch an opiate for 3 months) until I became a full fledged heroin addict about 2 years ago. Typical story, started off with trams and hydros, moved onto percs and oxy for the longest time, then it was too expensive so I switched to dope.

However, I need to throw in the towel. For now at least, for a while. I simply can not be spending this much money on opiates. I was able to balance my addiction and my life because I was making more money than I knew what to do with, but that isn't the case right now.

I have ""quit"" since I became an addict 2 years ago about 4 times. I quit, was clean for prob 2-3 months, and then relapsed. I ""quit"" again, clean for 3 weeks. ""Quit"" again, clean for a week. ""Quit"" again clean for 3 days. Since then, I have been high near every day, except maybe like 10 days total spread across the years. 

I have quit cold turkey, I have quit with the help of subs. I recently tried quitting again with about 40mgs methadone, that shit lasted 2 days.

However, I need to quit, for real, for an extended period of time. Shit, I want to, I just don't want to experience the withdrawls of a habit thats usually .5g-1.5g/day of BTH cold turkey.  So, I decided i'm gonna try the methadone clinic route. It's about $50/week. Fairly cheaper than what i'm used to.

Anyone here quit via methadone clinic successfully? I have heard good stories and horror stories. What i'm mainly scared of is becoming addicted to the 'dones and having to taper off for weeks on weeks. I have read that methadone WD's are beyond terrible. I want this shit to take like 3 weeks max, pref 2 weeks. Maybe I could do a ""flash quit"" type thing where I start off with a methadone dose thats enough to stop my heroin W/D's(lets say 40mg), take that dose for another day, then go down to 35mg, then the next day to 30, then the next to 25, then the next to 20, etc, til I get down to 0.  Is this realistic? I am mentally ready to quit without relapsing, as in I don't want to do this shit any more. But I am NOT mentally ready to quit because of withdrawls, hence the methadone route.

So yeah, anyone thats done the methadone clinic thing, could you share your story(if you don't mind) and maybe any tips you have? Advice? all that good stuff.

Thanks guys.",1430278070.0

We made arrangements to hook up again this Sunday. This time, I wanted 2 grams. I swooped by and picked him up, took him to his dudes, and have him an extra $20 before he went in for him hooking me up.
When he handed me the bag, I could smell vinegar immediately. This time it was a chunk instead of powder, with a small amount of duff in the bag. When I got home, the bag weighed 1.3
I sent him a message as soon as I weighed it and he said he didn't watch his dude weigh it out and there was no way it was that short.
I was supposed to split this with a friend. So, after 6 hours in the car, and $160 dollars later, I ended up with .3. He hasn't sent me another message since. This was a huge mistake because I am an awesome customer and there was lots of money to be made from me.

As of late their stuff has been good however while I have enjoyed their dope I decided to give this new guy a try.

He really sold me on the quality arguement, because it wasn't just his opinion I've been shooting full points as of late but I decided to play it safe(new batch) and make two rigs out of a point of his stuff.

Their stuff is bright white and little tiny chunks and loose powder. The colour is great and I PERSONALLY FIND THAT TASTE OFTEN SAYS A LOT ABOUT QUALITY(I realize this can be faked etc, but IME the more bitter the better the dope) 

His stuff is far more bitter and much darker when mixed up for a rig. 

The pebbles are all light brown and it's nice to get a series of  small chunks with one of the points being just a solid piece and others are made up of two pieces etc.

I thought maybe I should still buy 3 more from my regular guys and 3 more from him if they turn their phone on but atm I'm sold on these dark pebbles and I'm going to get 6 more from him bringing my total for the day to 9 points. :) And I'll have 7-8 when I go back to using at night(if temptation doesn't beat me) tomorrow. 

All this took was some leg work to find my regular guys when one of their numbers stopped working(a blessing in  disguise!) and bothering to talk to a couple of homeless people who were chilling in a field to ask if they'd seen one of the workers for my reg crew. 

The guy with her suggested some lady and the homeless lady said ""yeah but her stuff is crap I'm going to give him X's number. 

And it's also nice that this guy works 7 days a week from I think he said 8AM to 1AM every  night? I can call the reg crew at  3AM and such but that's hardly enough of a selling point especially when these pebbles seem better and this guy has a car and I'll never have to wait for him to pass the phone between people or wait for him to re-up the way waiting for these guys all the time seems to happen. I can't even count how many times I've been waiting cause a guy ran out and another guy just didn't feel like reloading him or they're switching workers etc. They might have more customers than this guy but this guy was fast and he seems to have better product, enough said. 

While colour is usually something I pay a little attention to TASTE and the consistency of the dope are usually better indicators for me.
***QUESTIONS***

***WHAT DOES YOUR IDEAL DOPE LOOK , SMELL AND TASTE LIKE?***

***DO YOU LIKE PEBBLES?***

***WOULD YOU PICK FAR MORE BITTER TASTING PEBBLES THAT ARE LIGHT BROWN OVER DOPE THAT IS WHITE AND AT BEST CRUMBLED AND AT WORST POWER/CRUMBLED?***

This dope 'looks dirty"" as in it's light brown and sorta speckled. But the liquid it produces is uniform in colour , dark brown and so fucking bitter...easily the most bitter stuff I've had in a long , long time. I'm actually pretty eager to pick up more and I wish I wouldn't have shot just half but of course I couldn't risk shooting a whole point of a new batch, so I guess I get points for doing a lighter tester shot but I'm sure now I could have handled it. I'm glad I didn't give into temptation and just shot half tho, better safe than sorry. I don't have a sky high tolerance to dope.

I've seen some post about different medications taking the edge off of withdrawal. I just can't remember exactly what people have said.

If so what were your experiences.

I've dropped 10mg this week, then was going to do another 10 next, then just take to my bed and cut the rest.
I've had withdrawals a couple of times, after forgetting my pills when I went away, so know what to expect. I can deal with it for a few days (the pain condition I was initially taking them for was so bad that the withdrawals were very bearable, if just fucking horrible)
My questions are, is there any danger in withdrawing dead, how long would I be looking at before the worst of the symptoms go away, and should I take any supplements to help with muscle cramps, nausea and restless leg?

After a while the nod gets boring for some people, so we start mixing other drugs in. 

In your experience, what do you like with your heroin that increase it's potency, duration, function, etc?
On the flips I've, what doesn't work? Either making your fix a waste of money or posing a potentially fatal risk. 

I've always been a fan of heroin and meth but found that in order to get the most out of your high, there's a few different ways to dose to get the desired effect. 
My preference is to start with H to get well, as soon as I feel my high peaking, I take a few hits of meth that just send it soaring, after that I kind of just coast through the rest of the day. It seems to be the most cost effective for me as well because it's only 2 relatively small doses (about a point of h and. 05 of crystal). Whenever I feel too tired, more meth, whenever I need to come down a bit, more brown.

When I say more, I mean like a tiny bit more, otherwise you're kind of playing tug of war, wasting money left and right in addition to posing serious risk of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure. 

This is all just my opinion but I find it to be effective. What do you guys use?",1430389707.0

We all know we're slaves and I'm sure many of you have at least considered quitting. Some of you may have even been torn between ending your life and quitting. We've all had some kind of realization that we cannot continue the habit forever. If you haven't even had that thought, this is not for you, please go.

For those of you that have considered it, how many of you have done it and for how long? A day? a week? a month? a year?

I've quit about 4 times now using the same method and the reason I go back is because I know I can do it again. I'd be lying if I said it was entirely painless; we all know it's not. I'd also be lying if I said that you won't crave it or that this won't test your will...because it most certainly will. 

I just want to help those of you who are ready. I am asking you to trust me. I know that is a hell of a lot to ask, I am not a medical professional, this is all from firsthand experience but I've helped at least 7 people quit with this method before and I know that at least for me, it works.

This is not cold turkey and it is not a long term suboxone maintenance program. This is a short term suboxone detox (the length will depend on you as the individual). The way it works is that suboxone will ease the wost of the withdrawals, it's long half life will remain in your system through acute stages of heroin withdrawal. Due to the short length, there will be no long withdrawal from suboxone and the slight discomfort you have will just be the very end stages of opiate withdrawal. In essence (and how it will feel) is as if you skip the first week and a half of feeling miserable without heroin (or your DOC). For some people, that's it! It's over, they're done! I've had 1 person report zero withdrawals whatsoever. 4 people reported discomfort, but managable. The other 2 struggled but pulled through anyway saying they couldn't have done it cold turkey.

I realize I probably sound like I'm trying to sell something at this point, but I'm not. If you're interested, leave a comment, I will personally work with each and every person 1 on 1 that leaves a comment here asking for my help.

This could be huge. This could be freedom. Ideally I'd like to organize this, get everyone ready and have everyone launch at the same time but I know that won't work for everyone with varying schedules. All you have to say is ""I'm in"" in a comment and we'll begin. You can also use this space for questions, comments and concerns, but I ask one thing. No negativity here please. Do not judge others for anything whether it's length of use, dose size, weak will to fight through the smallest symptoms of withdrawal etc.

To avoid rambling further, I'm going to end this post right here. 

TL;DR: I want to help you quit heroin. If you want to quit, comment ""I'm in"" and I will take it from there and work with you until you are clean.",1430385646.0

Like, 1.5 to 2 gram of tar IV'd a day. I got paid today, and was able to pick up a good amount, and still have money that I'm sitting on so I can buy some more when I run out. So, while I've been doing good at doing smaller shots and waiting longer between shots, I decided to treat myself and make my first real shot from this purchase a good one since I had it (don't worry, I did a small test shot when I first picked up). While I've been doing a good job of using less, that means that I haven't really been getting high, just the initial (mild) rush and I don't feel sick. Also, I've been using my hands and wrists recently, so I've been using what the needle exchange calls ""bee stingers"": 31 gauge short needles. I'd had no problems with them so far.

So, I make up my good shot, mixing ~5 points into 80 units of water, and doing what I normally do: draw it up with the last needle I used, then squirting it into a brand new rig to shoot with to, ironically, try to avoid clogging. But, as is not uncommon with my stupid small and deep veins, I had trouble hitting. After 15-20 minutes of trying, the rig clogged, so I had to tranfer it to a new rig and keep trying. I ended up having to transfer rigs like 4 times, wasting *too many* rigs. FINALLY, after nearly an hour, I see that wonderful plume of blood in the end of the barrel and tried to plunge it, but all that went in was the blood that flowed in, stopping at what was already in the rig. Pissed, I tried to transfer it again, but that's when I found out that the entire shot, after getting mixed with a small amount of residual blood that made its way in while trying to register, had *completely coagulated into a gel-like consistency*. There's no way I'd be able to shoot that, and besides, very little ended up in the new rig, since it immediately stopped up the end of the plunger's opening during the transfer attempt, causing the majority of it to miss the rig and end up in my hand and stuck in the clogged rig. I wasted *HALF A FUCKING GRAM* because my veins suck and it took too long to register. I ended up just swallowing as much as much as I could in an attempt to not completely waste it, and having to make up another, considerably smaller shot just to get well and sleep. 

I doubt many of you will care, but I just needed to vent a bit because I'm so pissed off, and you're the only ones I can talk to about this shit. Anyone else have something like this happen to them, or have any tips to salvage it if it ever happens again? FUCK what a waste.",1430381473.0

Some may say it's impossible but I know what came out of my mouth and that was something I've never experienced before and it tasted just like what shit would taste like which made me puke worse.  

How come I barely get sick anymore? Not like I'm complaining but it went from that to just having cramps and sweats and general uncomfort.   I just find it weird that the more I use the less sick I become. 

I know I'm a strange person asking strange questions, but i like having people I can talk to about this stuff and ask stuff I've always wondered.",1430354660.0

so i'm getting a chance to switch up my medication to be applicable for my current medical situation. i don't want to go too specific, but basically for the last 3 years or so, i've been scripted hydrocodone (starting at 30 a month, now to 120 a month). i plan on staying that for breakthrough pain but i'm going to be given a secondary, long acting opiate, to help overall pain alongside the instant release script.

now that being said, i do get a bit of a chance to sort of 'pick and choose' what exactly i want. of course i can't throw out something with the maximum dose - but what would you recommend for a long acting opiate that would work well with hydrocodone and also be beneficial for a little recreational fun?

big note: i do not use needles. so keep that in mind.

We were the only people younger than 25 in this company so we hung out.  She was a junior college stage actress.  I watched 2 plays and they were terrible.  Sera actually had no ear for music at all...But she was nice and my only real friend at work.  I was new to this city, new to this office job lifestyle, and new to wearing these suits.  I had to ask my landlord how to tie my necktie for the first day of work.  

But I hid a huge part of me from this new life.  The old me.  It still crept around, smirking, clever and forever high.  It hid behind this new twisted mask of civil responsibility and dress suits.  I had morphed into a new man.  My hair is short and neat.  No dye, leather or piercings.  I talk about sports, pretended to care about elections and learned how to fit right into their shiny little world.  

When I moved here I brought 120 oxycodone 30mgs.  This was my timer.  At the end would be only pain, sweating and the uncomfortable skin of depression.  I can't remember the last time I was sober and now was not the time to try...So one of my first tasks in this new city was to meet people.  Well, my kind of people.  And I found them.  Shirking from responsibility, skulking from daylight, roaming around in clubs, cafes and bars.  Dark clothing, dark music, needles, pills and powders.  My kind of people.

""You want some of this weed?"", coughed Sera holding a blue glass pipe shaped like a dolphin.  It looked like a sad little cock with a face on it.  

""No thanks"", I said.  We were on a lunch break and about to go into Olive Garden.

""Your loss"", smiled Sera.  ""Man, without a toke or 2 I'd never be able to sit in my cubicle.  Or deal with the boss man.""

Sera was sensitive about her weight and this came out right away when we met.  She would exercise but her back...Something about a car crash when she was a teen and crushed discs.  So she smoked a lot of weed.  She ate a lot of crap.  

""I bet you're saving your lungs for riding right?  All that biking keeps you in great shape.  Hey are you like a vegetarian?  They have veggie entrees here so-""

""No.  I eat meat.  Sometimes I even get high but I have 2 more meetings.  I need my brain.""

Sera laughed and took another hit and spewed a ganja cloud out her window.  Love that smell.  

""Aww you're so cute!  And so good!"", she giggled.

We went inside, got seated and I went into the restroom.  I took a coke bullet loaded with a powdered 30mg oxy and railed that love sweet love.  Bump, bump, bump, bump.  I checked my nostrils in the mirror and swallowed the other 30 mg.  Now I can eat.

""You know me and Christy thought you were a Mormon missionary..."", said Sera in between bites of pasta.  Christy was another admin but on aeronautic side of design.

""And why would you think that?"", I grinned.  Sera was silly when she was stoned.

""You know.  The suit, the bike.  All you needed was the book.  Like a Christian soldier"", laughed Sera.  ""How come you don't have a car?""

I shrugged.  ""I'm only 3 miles away.  Why not bike?""

The lie was casual and sounded so much nicer than revoked license, felony DUI or arrest warrants.

""Yeah we should all bike"", said Sera wolfing down another sausage.  

Man I loved watching this girl eat.  She ate like how most people fucked.  With lust and gusto.  

""Help the planet and cut back on pollution..."", she nodded as she pointed her fork at me, ""Plus you know I could use the exercise...""

She daintily wiped her mouth with the corner of her napkin and laid her big purple eyes on me...Ahhh a social cue!  The oxycodone in my blood smiled and took over.

""Why?  You look good Sera.  Quit beating yourself up.  We all need to eat.""  

Back in the office the swallowed pill caught up to me.  Now I can coast through the day.  Be THAT guy in the meetings, talk the talk and sit at my desk like a good worker bee.  

But then I check my phone text.  Fuck.  

no mo ox bru.  sry.  h?ecp?

It is Friday.  Tonight is the company holiday party.  I HAVE to go.  I dread this but this is exactly the kind of shit They do.  And only 5 more oxy in my stash...Fuck!  This was supposed to be a sure thing!  A feeling of dread creeps over me.  The coldness of opiate withdrawal.  I take a sip of water.  Like ice.  Like doom.  Like withdrawal.

But I know all about ECP.  I just don't know if I want to go there...I have been doing good tapering down my lust.  I haven't had any h for a month...

But I text him.  How could I not?  My little emo gargoyle friend who is the arcade attendant at his uncle's bowling alley:

Y ecp ok.  2.  good?

And we are cleared for takeoff.

This is not a date but Sera gives me a ride and treats it as such.  She looks resplendent in a green gown that shows plenty of cleavage.  I just wear another suit.  I realize how easy men have it in the world of office fashion.  You just need different colored ties.  Before we climb into her car I pop the last 2 oxys.  I munch one pill and swallow her sister whole for the good ol' one two combo.

The winter party is about as bad as expected.  Speeches from douchebags, a DJ blasting MC Hammer Cant Touch This and then Bon Jovi ballads.  An open bar which makes things interesting.  These people following the law...look how fucking crazy they get!  And I am high as fuck.  ECP bumps take me to the edge and I am definitely looking down a steep cliff again. 

This is before smartphones so the cellphone evidence is blurry.  The drunks get crazy on the dance floor.  People say incredibly rude things to each other.  Sera grinds herself into me and my skinny brain below the belt takes over.  We make out outside next to the Marketing Director who is puking over the balcony.  His admin is holding his jacket while he spews and waves at us.

I can't believe how much these people drink.  Then a sales VP comes out holding a bottle of Chivas, cracks a joke about the Marketing Director being a cheap Jew and then they all smoke a joint.  I excuse myself.  In the bathroom I hit a bump of ECP...fuck!  Hits so hard after oxy. 

Sera was too drunk to drive so I drove her home.  She insisted I come in and I thought about it for a second and said Why not?  But Sera was a mess.  Inside she went straight for her bong.  Then she blasted Journey and did an awkward air drum solo before she splayed out on the couch looking pale.  I asked if she was OK and she said, ""Water...crackers...""

After I got her water and crackers I went into her bathroom.  Old habits die hard and I instinctively opened her medicine cabinet.  Besides the usual arrays of dental care, ibuprofen and birth control sat Hydrocodone 7.5 and Morphine 20mg.  She had 2 full bottles of each.  Each still had refills.  Hmm.  I took 2 of each and swallowed them without another thought.

Sera was almost passed out at this point.  She still had her nice dress on plus her high heels.  I helped take off her heels and put a blanket over her.  She smiled sleepily.

""You want in?"", she asked opening the blanket.

""Sure""

I got next to her and she leaned on me.  It was one of those open moments where I could have made a move for sex or simply held her.  Probably could have gone either way but I am a junkie first and foremost.  

""Oww"", I sighed, rubbing my neck.

""What's wrong?""

""Oh.  I was in a car accident a long time ago.  Got a whiplash thing.  Usually I have meds but I haven't had time to look into my insurance yet.""

""Really?  I have pain killers in the bathroom.  If you want...""

""Are you sure?""

""Yeah.  I'm over that shit.  Makes me nauseous.  I'm all about the weed...au natural baby.  Take whatever you want.""

""Ok.  Thanks...""

I knew there was something special about Sera.  I hold her just to feel human warmth for she is passed out and snoring.  I call myself a cab.  While waiting I go in the bathroom, grab the pills and do another little bump of H.  I stand tall, fix my hair and straighten my tie.  I stare in the mirror and the demon stares back.  I smile at my old friend before I put my mask back on.  My mask whispers, I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE...",1430333141.0

I've stuck with him through everything so far: the lies, overdoses, withdrawals, rehabs and all of that. I love the guy more than anything and I wouldn't (at least would try my best not to be) angry with him if he does choose dope because it's his life and who am I to say his choices are any better or worse than mine? Still, I won't stay with him if he starts using again. He knows that and is seemingly encouraging of it. 



I don't really know anything about heroin and I'm trying my hardest to understand addiction. We don't really talk about his recovery except for me to say how proud I am of him and things like that. I've gone to several NA meetings with him and he insisted I have an app on my phone that shows me his location. He's offered a bunch of times to take a drug test or let me go through his phone but I've just said that I trust him and I'm his girlfriend, not a probation officer. 



I'm having doubts. He's on the shot so I know he's not using heroin. But last night his eyes were kinda red and glassy and he honestly looked like he was nodding but his pupils weren't pinned. I asked if he was okay and he got super upset and defensive which I thought was weird. Then today I saw this http://i.imgur.com/BrR3u4I.jpg on the floor next to his bed and when I asked him about it he said it was a tissue or a gum wrapper but it doesn't have the consistency of either. 


I feel like shit. No one deserves to be doubted by their girlfriend, especially not if they're actually clean. And if he did start using again, then we break up and that's alright. I'd much rather that than him having to live with shame and guilt and lying to me all the time. If anyone can offer perspective as to what he might be thinking/feeling and how I can be a better girlfriend that'd be so incredibly appreciated. ",1430331373.0
