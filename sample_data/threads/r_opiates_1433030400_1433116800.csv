Just wondering? I've been clean off heroin for a bit more now. I did take a total of 3 oxys since I've been home since late April. Just mainly to treat post acute withdrawal. As many of you know you go through mental withdrawal for up to a year after opiate abstinence. Usually consists of depression, anxiety, lack of motivation and energy, etc. This is your brain repairing its dopamine and opioid receptors.  Now I have a job so this can be a problem. But I do know how I react to Adderall, it's not really a high to me, I don't really get insomnia with it, and it's a good mood lifter. I think it's a more viable option than say alcohol and better than using other opiates and I'm not talking everyday use, I'm saying take 5mg when needed. And it's physically addicting like benzos would.

I was on Zoloft but then I realized it's not proper to get a mental health diagnosis when you just come off opiates, and it's not your regular state it mind. Plus getting off SSRIs can be a nightmare.

Thoughts?

My boyfriend and I are users. We use heroin. My boyfriend recently lost his job and has picked up another one but doesn't start until next week. I haven't had a job for about 6 months but just started a new job today. For the past months I haven't had a job, an ex of mine has been sending me large amounts of money. I send him pictures of myself, barely clothed and tell him sweet nothings to keep the money flowing. At first it was awesome and easy. But now I just feel like a whore. 

The guy lives on the other side of the US. My boyfriend knows about it and has asked me to ask him for money once in a while. 

Today we only were able to get $20 together for a bag and I offered my dealer a gift card we had. I asked my boyfriend 3 times if he was okay with it. He never gave me a clear response. 

We ended up with a $30 bag. Once we did it, my boyfriend was still very sick. He flipped on me that he wasted his gas, and he was mad that I sold the giftcard for less that what it was worth.

So I had to come up with money. I begged my ex, got money sent him a picture and felt disgusting. I have to pretend I'm okay with sending these pictures so I can keep money flowing. I can't tell my boyfriend I hate doing this because that money would stop and our use really wouldn't be affordable. 

Were about to pick up and all I can think, is I just want my boyfriend to get high and feel well, cuz then I can feel like its worth it. He has no idea how much I hate myself but I have to keep him happy. I love him so much. 

And this isn't a post to make people think my boyfriend is an asshole or something cuz he's not. He's really awesome and has us living in a nice house and he's a hard worker and does so much for me. But I can't imagine telling him I can't do this anymore. I feel like everything I do lately is wrong and this would be just one more thing. 

Ugh I'm sorry I needed to vent. I just feel horrible I keep justifying it as ""at least I'm not sleeping with him"" or ""at least I'll never see him"".

""Homatropine is an anti-cholinergic which serves the dual purpose of drying up mucous secretions like an antihistamine while supplying nasty side effects for anyone thinking they are going to get away with knocking back a mega dose of syrup. Each teaspoon contains 5 mg of Hydro and 1.5 mg of Homatropine. This small dose of Homatropine is considered a 'sub-therapeutic' dose, but if one takes several doses at once or too closely together the Federales will get their revenge on the syrup abusing public by sicking the nasty side effects of old homey atropine on yo ass.""",1433030574.0

So to cut straight to it, as the title says, I can't believe or understand how my WDs have been so bad the last 2-3 weeks, and any possible answers or tips or even just some sort of reassurance would be appreciated!

I'm absolutely not worried; more confused. I haven't been clean these past 3 or so weeks, but I've been gradually tapering with subs and trying to use smaller dosages less often, and my tolerance is currently the lowest it's been in about almost a year. 

To give some details: I usually stick to oxy and dilaudid (no IV'ing for me); I had a short stint, probably a week or two with gaps in between, with a couple of grams total of ecp insufflated (~100mg/day), but that was at least a month ago. 

Since then, I did a rapid sub detox and for the first time in a while, I was able to go through days where all I needed was small amounts of kratom, along with the other typical withdrawal tools (except lope; maybe I should try that, thoughts?). 

Since then, in the past two weeks, I've had nothing more than a two-day mini binge on dilaudid (I had 32mg total, and would sniff only 2-4mg at a time), and fucking codeine because that's all I could get. And I know my tolerance is the lowest it's been for a while because 60-120mg of the codeine could at least put a dent in the WDs.

So, here I am now, expecting to be dry for at least 2 more days, and I feel like I'm dying inside. There's this hole I feel in my stomach that feels like profound fear, anxiety, and hopelessness, and the only thing I can really do is distract myself from it for an hour or so at a time, mostly through exercise. 

My biggest symptoms besides the ""hole"" are crippling depression and fatigue, paired with a constant, mild nausea. 

Are these WDs what you would expect given a situation like mine, where I've been able to cut my tolerance down severely over the past few weeks but experience the worst WDs I've ever had? I know this is really specific to my situation, but I'm hoping that maybe some sort of answers or advice from all of you could be helpful not only to me, but to other people who may be going through similar things.

Thanks in advance for any advice you all can give! I know it seems like a dumb question and that I could just research, but I feel like I know a fairly good amount about WDs and am puzzled by my situation, and I know a lot of you have much more experience under your belts and could maybe offer unique perspectives on my situation, how I may be exacerbating it, and what I can do to make it better. Also, sorry if this is really sloppy. Benzos are a part of my survival kit, and they are currently doing the best they can for my body at the expense of my mind.",1433015059.0

I have been prescribed oxy for several years now and have been relatively fine at my current dose. Due to the same underlying health issues I had to quit smoking back when I was still just getting codeine. Lately I had been wanting nicotine again so I started using Swedish snus, and the buzz from that was quite nice so maybe I didn't notice it was shortening how long my oxy lasts, but now that I don't get a buzz from it anymore and just use it to stop nicotine cravings, I'm noticing that any sort of nicotine consumption is causing my oxy to stop providing both pain relief and that warm fuzzy feeling within like fifteen minutes. Even if I take twice my normal dose, it just seems to whoosh away. I know a lot of you smoke, so I was just wondering if anyone knows why this could be happening? Does nicotine normally counteract opiates? Does anyone here use snus and notice something like this? It seems to have gradually gotten more noticeable as my nicotine tolerance has gone up, and now I feel shitty because I have two competing compulsions that don't want to be friends. 

Thanks for any help",1433014735.0
