Like, lucky my brothers care about me or else I wouldn't have cigs. So broke that I traded food from my job for bag of weed to help me get through because not only am I too broke for all of the above, but too broke to buy dope is definitely the biggest blessing *and* curse of the whole ordeal. My daughter had an incredibly bad but incredibly quick moving stomach nug two nights ago. Got her thru it, didn't think anything else of it. Until about 2 hours after I got home from work. For the last. 6 or 7 hours now, I have been throwing up violently, and being as I haven't had much of an appetite this week, its just straight stomach acid: yellow, small amounts, painful to throw up. And I'm literally pissing out of my ass, and I can NOT keep water down to save my life. All I want to do is just drink my big ass cup of ice water and sleep. So after about 3-4 hours of this hell, I started wondering if maybe this was tied to my WD. So u hit up a friend who doesn't really fuck with the black except for to get it for me. Homie is the best middle ever so far, and he brought me .6 on front to last me til I got cash. Stand up dude. After he dropped it off, I immediately cooked a decent enough shot, but the vein immediately, and as soon as the rush took over (took the shot while shitting water on the toilet and throwing up all my water into the waste basket) I felt better. Cleaned up a little of my sick mess, actually was able to smoke a cig without making me throw up again, I was even able to drink some water. Decided I wanted one more shot before bed to help me sleep. Melt down the dope, draw it up into the rig, hi to insert the needle into my vein, and the FUCKING NEEDLE SNAPPED OFF THE GODDAMN SYRINGE!!!! Luckily it didn't snap off inside me but, the only rig I had left broke while fully loaded with a dark brown shot. I thought about smoking some but I have never been able to smoke up without coughing real bad, and right now that will 100% lead to vomiting. 

tl;dr - been horrendously sick, not sure with what, dope seems to help calm me down (got two hours of sleep after I banged that one shot) and I broke my last rig, leaving me with something that will make me feel better that I can't use. Just shoot me.",1510575597.0

The deal is for court if I don't fuck up probation violation goes away and I'm hit with a felony. No jail time is recommended but you never know since they gave me a chance.

I may, I doubt it but possibly failed my last drug test. I do not and cannot go the sub route cuz then my work (I contract for the navy in finance) will know I was using again.

I go 2-3 days not thinking about it then on the 3rd or 4th day I just fucking want dope. I want the rush. I've lost interest in all of my hobbies like working out, hanging with friends shooting the shit. When I come home from work I just chill with my fam cuz I'm trying to establish trust so I eat dinner at my parents and watch tv and talk to my dad about work cuz he's in a similiar position but he works for the gov. Even when I'm with my gf I think about dope. She had a bad k addiction but is doing better though she did an 8 ball with me of K at a zeds dead concert last night (it was fucking nutssssss). I love designer drugs I did 4 caps of molly and a shit ton of k and fishscale last night but nothing compares to dope. I'm so scared I'm gonna get strung out again. Also, I have had a few really scary ODs recently. For one of them I was approx dead for 2 mins cuz my friend is used to seeing me pass out but this time my face and lips turned purple after a min so he had to hit me with Narcan (thank god he did I really don't want to die)

In college I was prescribed concerta 36 and Valium for my anxiety. My anxiety now is so bad that I have tremors and when I do dope half the time I have to have someone hit me cuz my hands don't function. I've always had struggles with ADHD and ADD. On Saturday I did some adderral and gabapentin while my gf was at work and that combo had me feeling normal. 

Should I see a psychiatrist? I've heard different answers from friends which have confused me.  I know it sounds pathetic but at this point right now I need a daily pick me up. I feel I'm so scared, anxious, and maybe even depressed to the point that I need something.

I've heard just quit the dope. When you're an IV user it's not that easy. I'm not strung out. I have been slowing down. I really could use your help guys and gals. Below are a couple recent pics of me. I'm healthy, at a good weight, I have a great family and Job. But trust me I've been to hell and back. No one can see the pain in my eyes. My life is one big facade. I feel terrible for my past and I know I'm going to hell for the things that I've done. I've seen murder, death, OD, the nastiest trap houses you could imagine. I've seen a lady put a bag over a dogs head because she couldn't afford to feed the dog (I saved the dog and took him to the shelter he has a forever home now). My good friend was murdered shot in the face sleeping. I've seen too much for being so young and living in a very rich part of our country. I want to feel normal and provide for my family and my gf and my friends. And I definitely do not want to die.

I *love* opiates, but I'm a weird heroin user. I get addicted, quit my addiction after a short while, stay clean for 6mo-1.5yrs, then pick it up again and repeat. I pick it up intentionally and I actually kind of view it as cleansing, like a little vacation. A reset button on life.

EDIT: I AM NOT ADVISING THIS. Know yourself, know your weaknesses, and be smart about them.

I've been doing this for about 9 years now. During that time I've graduated from college, went to grad school, had stable and fulfilling relationships, bought a home, and have formed a successful career. I have a savings, stocks, and a 401k. I've never been in legal trouble with drugs despite periods of heavy use.

Doing drugs in this manner has taught me *a lot* about myself and addiction. I sometimes make it sound easy but it *is not* easy. My success thus far, however, puts me in a unique position to hopefully be able to give some useful advice.

Successful quitting depends on a few key things in my opinion:

**Obtainable Goals:**

You need to set obtainable goals. If you've been a heavy user for 10 years straight you can't expect to drop the needle tomorrow. You'll likely fail, you'll get discouraged, and that might prevent you from trying again later.

Instead, set incremental, obtainable goals: Baby steps. At first, these shouldn't even be related to drug use (I'm actually against tapering). An example might be: 'Today I'm going to paint a painting. Tomorrow, I'll wash the floor.'  Get used to setting small goals for yourself and living up to those goals. This brings me to my next section:

**Train Willpower:**

* Your ability to quit depends on your willpower
* Willpower is a muscle
* Your addiction has weakened this muscle
* In order to quit, you must strengthen your willpower
* To strengthen your willpower: *do things you hate*

The best way to do this is to *set small goals* (meta) to do things you hate but are not bad for you. An example might be taking an ice cold shower, cleaning your apartment, or (if you can) exercise. If you hate carrots, go eat carrots. If you hate art museums, go to the art museum. Get used to forcing yourself to do unpleasant things. It builds willpower, and willpower will be needed to successfully quit.

Sidenote: Seems obvious, but if you start liking something it no longer counts as something you hate. 

**Test the waters:**

As you develop willpower, start testing the waters with your addiction. Most users have tried and failed to quit. Instead, quit for longer and longer periods of time. If you're a heavy user, start with a day. Moderate user, maybe suffer through a withdrawal cycle. If less heavy, quit for a week or two. Do this a handful of times and *accept that these are test runs and not your final sendoff*. This serves several purposes:

* Familiarizes you with the feelings you'll experience
* Avoids discouragement
* *Builds willpower*
* Lowers tolerance

Don't make the decision to fully quit haphazardly. Train for it and prepare for it. You should have tested the waters several times, and have a good idea of what you'll experience.

Sidenote: Be *VERY CAREFUL* not to OD if resuming usage. Start small!!

**Perform a ritual:**

When you finally are ready, perform a ritual as a sendoff. No, you don't have to dance around any fires naked (unless you want to). However, you should do something tying you to this moment. Consider burying (literally) some part of your life or lighting a sky lantern.

**Quit:**

Personally I've always found cold turkey to be most effective.

**Recognize that withdrawal is the easy part:**

Acute withdrawal is, in my opinion, one of the easier parts. Not only are you face-to-face with one of the worst aspects of the drug, but you haven't used up all of your willpower yet. 

The hardest days are the ones that follow. The hollow, empty ones where you have no friends, no-one to talk to, and you're pretty sure your family hates you. It is important to continue training willpower--these days are why we train.

**Replacement:**

Replace your addiction with something less harmful. Running and yoga are popular among ex-addicts, and for a reason. If you're worried about replacing one addiction for another: don't be. Baby steps. Worry about that in a year.

Hope this helps!",1510550810.0

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I have never run out before, and I have been having the most excruciating fibromyalgia flare up the past 5 days. I only get oxycodone 10mg 4 times a day, so not a big script and it just hasn't been helping enough during this flare up. 

I went to the urgent care yesterday, and the doctor told me she couldn't do anything for me and to go to the hospital because they'd most likely be able to help me with pain. She was a nice enough woman, and also recommended I tell my doctor to order tests for rheumatoid arthritis. Well, I can't afford to go to the hospital, and am already stuck with an urgent care bill. My deductible is very high and I have not yet found a different insurance provider during open enrollment. 

I have 1 pill left and I see my doctor tomorrow. Should I just tell him that I'm out (one week early) or just go through the WD and wait?

EDIT:
UPDATE:
So I go to my appointment, tell him about everything that went on this month and how I'm having a horrible flare up and my current meds just aren't helping. I didn't tell him I ran out, but every time I brought up medication he kept telling me to take this Tizanidine shit that makes me very nauseous, and even gave me refills on it. I've tried it and it helps but it really doesn't do shit when I'm in this much pain. Relax my muscles all you want, other parts of my body hurt too and all it's doing is making me sick more than anything. He didn't talk about the oxycodone once, and I really don't think he would give it to me at all if I hadn't been getting it for a few years now.

I'm extremeley disappointed because it seems like he brushed off everything I said. I wanted trigger point injections too, but it seemed like he just kind of rushed through everything. He also didn't order any bloodwork or tests for rheumatoid arthritis like that doctor at the urgent care suggested. He just doesn't seem like he cares about pain management.
 
I fucking hate this. This shit is what I dealt with for years and it's so fucking rare to find a pain management doctor that actually gives a shit if you're hurting. On my way out, I passed by an office with the door open where the doctor I just saw, the owner of the practice, and two CNAs were listening to a phone call ON SPEAKER with a patient explaining how badly she is in pain. I heard somebody say, ""Yes *name* you're just going through withdrawals. That's part of it,"" in a very dismissive tone. It made me both disgusted and thankful I didn't mention that I was out of meds because I'm pretty certain I would have been dropped from the program immediately. I fucking HATE the owner of the practice; he's a manipulative, sexist, judgmental asshole that tried to make me take a bunch of sample medication that could have killed me, all because he didn't look at my chart and see that these medicines are very dangerous when combined with some of the other stuff I was already on. He had such a condescending look on his face when listening to this poor woman on the phone, and how unprofessional is that to blast her when there are patients that can easily hear?

I really appreciate everyone's advice, and I wish I had a doctor that just put in the effort. I don't see him being there for long, simply because he's new and I'm sure he's just there to get experience until he finds a job in healthcare that he actually wants to do. Now I'm fucked for a week, don't have any connects around here, and am just going to have to suffer through.",1510538678.0

I've been lurking here for about 2 months now on and off and today something happened I'd never thought would happen to me. 

As a bit of backstory: I'm generally unlucky. I've once found 50 bucks on the street and that's literally it. I've never won any sort of contests or anything. My real life RNG (for you non MMORPG nerds that's luck) is essentially 0. 

Last night, me and my homeboy decided to celebrate me being clean off dope and pills for 2 months so we hit up my man and ordered a gram of coke. All goes well, we have a blast, smoke some weed and have a great time together till we run out and he has to leave because it's 5 AM at this point, plus my friend still had to walk for at least 30 minutes to get home. I go to bed and just chill and read 1984 and pass out.

Today I wake up and realise I'm almost all of out bud. As I start thinking of how I can fix this problem I start rolling myself a joint but I can't find my tips. After 5 minutes of scrambling around on my messy as fuck desk that I can't be arsed to clean I suddenly notice a pretty big, white and glistening chunk. I gently took a little taste with the tip of my tongue and it turns out I have enough coke left to last me the whole night. 

I've never had shit like this happen to me, not even after 7 years of daily opiate/benzo use. I am the happiest boyo alive right now.

I offered to a girl to talk to her and get her clean. She really wants to go to rehab and get off of dope, get off of coke, and not die. I said aight cool I will help you out with that. 

She has pain issues, has hyper anxiety issues, does have a medical need for benzos. Was on soma for pain management from a doc who cut her off after she dropped dirty. Got put on such a high dose of benzos by another doc- who I found out she was sleeping with- that if she goes without for 24 hours she will have a seizure. Keeps asking me to find her a place to go but no place will take her without going 24 hours without being high except a detox which can taper her. 

But she won't go to the detox since asshole doc who she fucked told her all the stuff she is on would take a 6month long detox in a hospital, but won't make the fucking recommendation because it is more convenient for him to just have her look crazy and die since he would lose his medical license and probably be charged.

So I have like a dozen different places set up, all ethical not insurance fraud joints. She refuses to go to any of them since she is convinced that if she goes off soma at all she would die. Even though they offer all a nice long taper and shit. But she refuses to even consider the option so I said well I can lock you up in a psych ward or in my basement or some shit but if you want to have a nice comfy taper with a nice comfy bed and docs watching you then you should probably be okay with going off the soma for 24 hours. Otherwise you don't get to go to a cushy rehab to kick.

I got this bitch scholarships, round the clock care, the promise of a month long taper so she don't feel shit, and she still doesn't want it. So fuck it. Do your thing but don't fucking bother me.",1510527552.0

Should I start going down to 1.5 instantly starting now?
 Or even 1g as my first step down? Then .25g each successive step? 

I'm not sure the best plan of attack is. Trying to save for a new phone. Been wanting the s8 since before it was released and it costs less than my weekly reup. I'll probably be getting just quarter pieces each reup instead of halves since my connect raised prices and it's not worth it at the current pricepoint. 

Felt I should also mention I'm not getting high at all with the amount of tolerance I have. Haven't in a long time. I basically need to smoke .5-1g in a sitting to feel something. Nothing better than waking up and actually feeling something since I'm able to sleep 12hrs. But after that just redosing all day leads to just staying well unless I trail an absurd amount.

Suboxone on the other hand, with my tolerance, it seems I could get 32 doses out of a 16mg strip. And a 16mg strip is $20. So that seems way cheaper. How is the high of suboxone though?

Kratom is also another thing I have thought about but I didn't really plan on buying it because of tolerance + it's more expensive and it's not a true opiate. 

My tolerance is low because I've been off of opiates for 3 weeks. Broke as fuck and I already went through WDs. I can get some sleep because I have lots of valium but I feel like shit all the time and can't stop craving. Not willing to use heroin yet.

Doctors should go on strike.,"The god damn DEA is probably one of the biggest reasons why doctors are too afraid to provide proper pain relief to patients, because they know it's very possible for their medical licenses to be revoked, or them going to jail and/or facing some big fine... all for being compassionate. But then again, when you have a group of fucking idiots who aren't even smart enough to dream of being a doctor one day, who work in the DEA and obv have no idea what it's like being a chronic pain patient or a doctor wanting to help them out. And it's been proven that like a tiny tiny subset of blatantly crooked doctors/pill mills provided the huge majority of the illicit or abused pills. Way to punish everyone for the fuck-ups of the few. 

So anyway, I just thought like... 'I wonder if like every non-urgent doctor, mainly ones like pain management ones, other specialists, primary care physicians, maybe even pharmacists too, went on strike until the DEA backed off and let them do their jobs."" IMO that'd be pretty effective, since tons of people want to see doctors, and with only like ER docs and ambulance EMTs around, people will start to hate the DEA real quick. Hopefully the average joe schmo idiot will then finally realize how fucked the DEA is, and public opinion/support for them will plummet. But then again I could see a lot of doctors being apprehensive in doing so, fearing repercussions, and, at least AFAIK, doctors aren't usually union employees, and don't have such protections for going on strike (as well as strike pay, but a lot of doctors seemingly have a good amount of savings to live on for the duration of the strike), or they're apathetic about the whole situation; maybe it doesn't even really effect them, and they don't care enough about compassion and preventing the govt./others in general from interfering/preventing them from doing their jobs, and wouldn't wanna be in on it. 

Idk, this just popped into my head, and I thought that this'd make a good point of discussion on here. Although I wouldn't be surprised if this is a sorta 'preaching to the choir' situation here, since I'm sure most of us on here are very much pro-individual rights, pro-government staying out of our lives, and anti-DEA/anti-drug war. But I'm curious to hear what you guys have to say about this. Anyone else here ever think of something similar?

7cg9dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7cg9dm/tips_on_opium_pills/,8,https://redd.it/7cg9dm,Toosome,Tips on opium pills," 
Hello fellow Redditors. I have in my possesion a pack of lamaline. Each pill consists of 300 mg of paracetamol (AKA acetaminophen), 10 mg of opium and 30 mg of caffeine.

Can I get high of this? I know that if you consume too much paracetamol¬† (AKA acetaminophen), you will damage your liver seriously and it's a very common incident unfortunately, but only if you reach over 4 grams per day (I think). But to do this, I would have to swallow more than 10 pills, which I think would be more than necessary to reach a good high. Maybe the paracetamol is disrupting this though? I don't know.

I've seen that you can perform CWE (cold water extraction), but is this really necessary?
I'd like to try it though, sounds fun but risky and I lack the tool to measure degrees.

I have never tried opium pills before so I don't know what to expect from this,but I have some experience with tramadol. Tramadol is a super great opiate in my opinion but is hard to get. I really love it but you have to respect it and learn how to handle it, it can be very dangerous.

A long time ago I had a very weird reaction from it. It turned my penis very swollen into a shape of a tennisball (I'm not kidding). But fortunatly there was no pain and nothing bad happened, I just had to wait a day to get my penis back again. I guess I had taken too much.

Thanks for reading this and I hope my writing isn't too bad or confusing! Share your thoughts and tips.

I'm not in any serious debt or bankrupt or anything like that, but it would be nice to save some money! It's frustrating the amount of money I make and yet can't seem to build my savings.

I know most people will say, ""well, duh, if you're a junkie of course you're gonna be broke."" Yes, that's the cliche answer, but I think it's a cop-out answer, and probably just a widely accepted myth.

Is it safe to use a filter (rolled up end of a q-tip) twice for IV coke and is a ""proper"" hit similar to a hit of smoked crack in the sense that intense nausea is almost guaranteed?

First off this is rather long but imo the more info you know the better. Also, rather than opiates I'm using coke (some of the best I've had round my way for a minute) so I apologise for this not being opi-related, but I know some of us here snowball so it's kinda relevant in that respect and a lot of us here IV so I thought this would be the best place to ask! But I digress...

When I prepare a shot, I roll up the end of a cotton bud (q-tip for those of you across the pond) as tightly as I can to use for a filter. I then drop water onto the little ball to get it wet to minimise wicking (like you do to the filter used when you CWE) and proceed to mix my stuff, plop the wet cotton ball into the mix and draw up. 

Now here comes the main point with a few questions to follow: 

- When I prepare the next shot I do the same process but with the same filter. I press it down to ""wring"" out what's left from the previous shot in the plain water to minimise waste and try to get as much out of it as possible. Is it safe to do this considering I only use the same filter twice?

- As I have been very careful with my doses I now have an idea as to how much I need to use to get a good hit. When I used to smoke crack it used to make me feel really nauseous for a few minutes so will it be the same with IV coke?

I understand that I sound like a complete noob - which is semi-true - I just live by the mantra ""knowledge is power"" and harm reduction is top banana; I would just like to hear from seasoned users if I am doing anything wrong and whether or not I need to prepare for the violent ejection of my stomach contents.

Thanks everyone, stay safe and big love to all. üëå

Obviously it is well known that opioids induce euphoria within a good many who partake...a mellow relaxed high that many folks come to love, but I think there is sometthing more and deeper to the draw...

I was reading a novel (""The Devil's Bag Man by Adam Mansback, an absolutely killer book for anyone that loves to read), and something within the novel brought me to a what I feel might be some deeper insight and  understanding regarding the ""nod"" state so many of us lovers of opioids seek out...

I haven't heard this mentioned before, and though it's an original thought from my mind, it has probably been surmised before...

I don't know how other people feel about this, but I have always been fascinated by dreams...finding them awesomely entertaining and utterly fascinating, even when they are deeply disturbing...

I feel like achieving the ""nod"" state is synonymous with dreaming while awake...as someone who loves a great dream, and hates when the powerful emotions and feelings of a dream dramatically fade upon awakening, I feel like part of the insatiable appetite for the opioid high/nod has to do with yearning for the ability to be able to experience the state of dreaming while being more fully conscious then when asleep...

I'd love to hear what other folks have to say about this, I mean obviously when you are nodding it's similar to being asleep and dreaming, and consciousness is greatly diminished, but it seems like it allows one to keep one foot in the realm of dreams, while one foot remains in conscious awareness... you are able to toggle bac and forth and relish the dream state in a way where you are more conscious and able to enjoy it compared to the state it is experienced when one is asleep...

I hope this generates some interesting discussion... as a side not I have found things like astral projection and lucid dreaming to be utterly fascinating, and an area I would love to further eplore. I fond myself wondering if this facet of my interests might have anything to do with my draw towards the opioid high and the nod...

I loo forward to hearing what some of you folks might have to say about this idea, I've never really heard it discussed before, and would love to hear if I'm alone or not in this realization...",1510642102.0

This is due to many reasons, whether it be denial, anxiety, stress, you name it. I've finally come to terms with myself and my habit. I am an oxycodone addict. I'm a recent college grad who unfortunately spent my junior and senior years addicted to oxys. It's incredible how fogged up your brain gets when you are taking these damn pills... I need advice. I need help. I have no one else to turn to and after coming here and reading post after post from all of you kind individuals, I finally decided it was time to reach out. A little background info and I apologize for this wall of text... I have been addicted for roughly 2 years. It started out as a once a weekend thing, until before I knew it, I was up to 90-120mgs/day. In the past 2 years I have had one clean stint of 1 month long and 4 random weeks spread throughout the months due to lack of money, or a sudden realization of how much of a fuckup I am. Basically, it's time to quit. Should have quit months ago, but nows finally the time. I am ready. These past 6 days, I've taken a total of 35 oxy 30s and finally ran out tonight at around 10:30EST(also took 2mg xanax). I have 2 8mg suboxone to fall back on and intend on taking them sparingly and only on an ""as needed"" basis. The plan is to take 1mg tomorrow at 10:30 and hope that is long enough time to avoid PWD and is a sufficient amount to take away the withdrawals. Pretty much, I need advice from all of you. How should I plan this taper schedule? Can I actually taper off with 16mg of sub and have little to no withdrawal? Am I giving myself enough time in-between doing 30s and dosing sub? Any input is greatly appreciated. I really need to quit and I know I won't be able to do it alone. Nobody knows about this habit. You all are who I need most right now. I have spent close to $30,000 in the past 4 months on these damn pills.. The anxiety is crushing me. I'm so worried I am going to lose my job I have worked so hard to obtain and it kills me to reach out to you guys, because i know there are plenty of you who have it way worse than me and I am truly blessed to have not hit rock bottom yet. Please provide me with some sort of taper plan or any words of encouragement you can provide. I truly appreciate this from all of you. Much love and godspeed.

TLDR; 2 year oxy addict. 90-180mg/day for the past 2 months. Probably spent over 100k over the 2 year span. CC maxed out. Ran out of pills tonight, have 16mg of sub. Need any form of advice on how to approach this.

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

The winter is a junkies bane. The cold seeps into your bones and and twists them with pain. 

The phone ring, and it's who I'm waiting for. For a brief moment the excitment and anticipation take away the pain. But it comes back when he says it will be two hours more. I groan and roll into my bed. 

I think that this must be hell. My own personal hell. I roll over and over. I think about all I have lost, my family i have alienated and pushed away witb drugs and bad choices. 

I watch the clock for two hours and thirty minutes before calling him three times in a row until he answered. 

"" hey bro I'm outside, I-)

I didn't let him finish. I sprint outside and hop into the mustang sitting in my driveway. . He appears to be trying to eat his ear, as tweaked as I have ever seen him. I hand him 120 bucks, he hands me 4 blues. I tell him thank you. I could have kissed that possum eyes tweaker hillbilly on the lips I was so estatic. Before he gets a chance to start an endless rambling conversation, as he usually does, I tell him I'll hit him up tomorrow and sprint inside. 


I shake so hard drawing up the murky blue fluid through a cotton I strike the needle on the bottom of my trusty spoon. The needle bends. A thick burr is on the end. Its no matter. My arms are already beat and there is no way this shit isn't going in my veins.

The unsurprisingly dull needle pops into my skin with a little resistance, and then a little more when I slip into old faithful laying in the V between my thumb and forefinger. It hurts. 

I'm not too shaky to hit a vein, the blood that begins to fill the syringe looks like a mushroom clouds. I decide that is rather fitting and push the plunger.

Warmth. Relief. Stillness, inside and out. I feel what is close to pure joy, but not close enough.  A smile creeps into the corner of my mouth, I light a cigarette and close my eyes. The aromatic smoke fills my lungs, as I blow it out I think to myself, ""I have to get clean, because almost every day of a junkie is nearly the same""

So I tend to get dope in larger quantities (7-14g max or something like 50 Oxies) and WD in between with hopes of never getting back and crying in loneliness - aka ""the usual"". It's important to get it in large quantities much less frequently.

Now, when the shit comes, what I do, is I create few emergency portions and hide them well. From the perspective of me getting new shit, I don't care. I have more than enough for now, and I won't be running out anytime soon so it doesn't phase me at all. By the time I run out I don't even remember where and if I put aside anything at all.

No luck after 45 minutes and I'm SUPER FUCKING PISSED CUSSING myself out, etc. Finally, I get a smidge of an idea. Hey maybe it didn't hit the floor at all.

Many of the negative effects, especially those we experience as dependent individuals occurs due to tolerance, dose escalation and downregulation of the endogenous opioid system (fewer, less sensitive MOPs) and an increase in the level of signalling from other excitatory neurochemical pathways. 
Acute withdrawal is often the result of an upregulated overactive noradrenergic system combined with increased glutamatergic neurotransmission. These develop rapidly and are lost rapidly (although when withdrawing a week of the brain downregulating these upregulated systems in response to acute opioid withdrawal seems anything but rapid). 

It has been shown that many of the downstream compensatory pathways that are activated in response to chronic opioid use are triggered by opioid receptor internalisation.  Morphine, Heroin, Fentanyl all bind to the MOP causing its phosphorylation and eventual internalisation (as well as releasing a G-Protein from the complex leading to the positive subjective opioid effects. 

TRV130 is an opioid optimised for maximum G-Protein signalling (pain relief, sedation, euphoria) and minimal beta-arrestin2 signalling (internalisation, tolerance and physical dependence). 

It doesn‚Äôt feel like morphine to take, nor does it sedate as much as Fentanyl. I have used it to replace my entire Fentanyl and morphine usage for the last 2 days and have not suffered any WD or ill effects. Nor have I had to escalate the dose. 
I plan to continue the experiment for the rest of the week. 

Please take some time to read the [link](http://www.trevena.com/pdf/ChenetalJMedChem2013_TRV130leadop.pdf) to see how this opioid with unique and possibly very positive features for those dependent, in pain requiring excessive opioid doses due to tolerance and for those new opioid users in acute leading to chronic pain that may avoid rapid dose escalation and tachyphylaxis with this interesting almost licenced chemically unique opioid drug. 
There is also a Wikipedia article for TRV130 which contains less information but may be more accessible to everyone. 

(When licensed, if not before, this drug is bound for schedule 2, so any others interested in synthesis out there, the enclosed paper will also sure give you some ideas on how to modify TRV130, once scheduled, to produce legal analogs (until those get scheduled also), as it did for myself)

I lost the crooks of my arms, and I have a really hard time hitting other veins for no particular reason (I have really good veins too). I live in NJ so my dope is ECP (powder) and the veins in my forearm have a lot of scar tissue so they're pretty hardened and sore.

I couldn't hit any other vein so I went to my left forearm which I've left alone for a few days (really didn't want to use it but I'm desperate). I drew a tiny bit of blood, tried to dig around for some more blood and got some more to the point where I felt comfortable. I injected just a little bit - it didn't burn at all (it usually would, and I've missed a tiny drop with this same dope and it'll burn if I missed), so I kept going little by little until it was all gone. In the back of my mind I don't feel like I registered well enough, but it didn't burn at all, everything was fine after, and all was well. I didn't really feel the rush I usually feel, but I had also done a lot an hour prior to this one, and was just doing these 2 bags to get  as much of a nod as I could.

If I press to where the vein is, right before the scar tissue that I'm trying to avoid is, there is the tiniest of tiny bumps (where I IV'd). You have to press to feel it and it's barely noticeable. Doesn't hurt, isn't warm, isnt swollen, isn't red at all: nothing. But for some reason I still have some gut feeling that I missed.

So, the reason for this post is - can I still have missed even though I didn't experience any of the burning/symptoms of a miss? Does it always go the same way? Or did I just get lucky and I was registered enough to get it all in there without a problem?


TLDR ---- feel like I missed a shot but there wasn't any pain/burning, no symptoms, no redness, no swelling, no lumps/bumps, no nothing - I did register SOMEWHAT but I just kind of pulled the trigger on a whim because I was frustrated. Can you still miss without experiencing any symptoms? Would be the first shot I ever fully missed.",1510726917.0

It's crazy to think of how far I've come. Moved over 1000 miles away from my home state to a warmer land, winter has never been better. I weighed 130 pounds in May at my worst as a daily IV heroin/meth addict (6 foot 2 inch tall male) and I have gained 60 pounds !  I also have maintained the same job for 6 months and recently purchased a car registered and insured in my name. I'm registered for college in January and of course getting high still has it's appeal. But after going to an NA meeting tonight it just doesn't feel like an option.

Know that you can quit, it takes some courage and pain getting through the withdrawals, but in the end if you are REALLY sick and tired of being sick and tired, there are so many good rehabs in US, Canada, Europe, etc if that is an option. It worked wonders for me.

Not sure if I can do this but if anyone is in the American South West, there's a drug/alcohol treatment program I live at that is phenomenal. It's a ranch outside of town with animals and around 30-35 dudes at any given time that CARE a lot about their sobriety. The awesome thing is that it's a mere $700 a month which includes food and rent and treatment. Thats a steal compared to other programs charging thousands.

Or at least I thought.. If you dont Im about to really help you out!! Enjoy,"So I just recently saw a post somewhere with a picture of a pill and someone asking if it were fake or not, and I'm not gonna lie this kind of blew my mind.  First that people are still trying to detect if pills are fake or not by looking at it (which I guess can help sometimes but others its impossible and the fakes look better than the real ones) and the fact that by not knowing how to test for this and the current situation of the market these days that its ridiculous and I can only imagine how many times you've been ripped off and will continue to get ripped off, so I thought I'd share this method I learned, and hopefully it will help you guys out in detecting fakes just as much as its helped me.  Enjoy!

When purchasing prescription medication off the street's these days you at constant risk of purchasing fake or imitation shit, claiming to be one medication but in return getting a pill filled with a bunch of fillers and food coloring leaving you on the verge of withdraw and begging for anything just to get well.  So that's why I am going to let you in on a little secret I know, that someone taught me wayyyy back in the day and has been saving my ass ever since.  Because it might not be your dealers intentions to sell you fake shit but you never know when your going to come up on the shit and whether they knew or not you don't want to be the one getting stuck with the shit at the end of the day.  So use these quick couple of steps to test your medications before buying them and hopefully you wont be fucked and posting pictures like the kid mentioned above hoping that you have real shit when you and I both know if hes posting on here asking.. Its most likely fake shit.. 

So lets begin..

How to test if the medication is bunk or not.. 

When purchasing the medication what you want to do is take the pill itself and tap it lightly on your tongue.  I'm not talking slobber all over it, just one simple light tap on the tongue should do and you should be able to tell in a matter of seconds.  Also if done correctly the person your buying them from will have no idea what you even just did nor care because it wont affect the medication what so ever and if you end up not wanting it just hand the shit back and say no its fake and there's nothing they can really do in the first place.  

So don't ask if you can tap it on your tongue just ask to see it and take a few out at random and tap them on your tongue.  If the medication is real when tapping it on your tongue you'll immediately be able to tell.  The pill will have a sour, lemony, prescriptiony pill taste, that can be immediately' noticed and hard to explain but if you a prescription pill of some kind next to you (which I'm sure most of you have ;) ) grab that thing and tap it on your tongue and you will soon see what I am talking about.  Its almost exactly like what a fresh bottle of oxy smells like the second you get them from the pharmacy and open it up for the first time and inhale that beautiful chemical smell into your lungs.  Its that but in taste..


Now if the medication is fake or bunk and the guy is trying to rip you off.  The will will almost have the complete opposite affect once tasting it.  Instead of being pungent and sour and lemony, electric.  It will instead be so bland, chalky, tasteless, and seriously feel like its almost repelling the moisture off of your mouth and will taste like absolutely nothing, except chalk.  



You'd be surprised about how many real looking fakes are out there.  So much so that one time I got sold 1,000 fake pills back in the day and they looked so real that I used to take 2 out of 5 pills and replace them with the fakes and bet people that if they could pick the two fakes out of the group that I would give them the 3 real ones that were in there and let them look at it and examine them in any way possible, yet unfortunately no one knew this technique and no one was ever able to detect the 2 fake ones out of the group, but if they'd of known this method it would of been as easy as 123 and I would of been out of three of my shit.l haha

However, this method hasn't stopped me from buying fake pills since I learned it because honestly most of the time we are getting ripped of the con artist whose doing the deal knows whats going on and will distract you enough to the point where your going to hand the money over before ever being able to get the chance to look at shit.  So you've got to be smart when doing these things, and just remember when its to good to be true, or when you have the feeling you about to get ripped off.. Most of the time you are and you should just get the fuck out no matter how hard that is at times, but just try your best to get out of the situation and definitely don't hand over any money.

Because think, you and I both know that if someone if going to have a problem with you looking at the shit before purchasing it, most of the time its not a good situation.  You don't need to see them all.. Just one will do the trick.  So give it your best shot and just remember this the next time you buying your medication!

Luckily I've already pawned all my guns or that would've happened already so it's slamming my car into a wall at 9o or taking a nosedive off my apartment building... I don't know if I can wait long enough to get my next check on Monday to just od and go be with my baby.... 

Im just lost man. Im sick of this rollercoaster of wheeling and dealing... I haven't slept for more than 20 min at a time for the past three days and needless to say I've already taken advantage of my family one to many times for them to give me cash... So im stuck in a constant state of hell... 

What is the process to getting Suboxone? 

How much does it usually cost?

Search result -The noun recovery refers to the process of healing after an illness.

-----For me, kratom has definitely allowed me to heal.

Search result -Recovery is sometimes used as a synonym for ""being in remission""

-----For me, kratom has definitely helped my addiction to heroin to be in remission. And then in turn my mind and body.

PSYCHOLOGY TODAY: In most of life, ""being in recovery"" means a person is making progress even though she/he isn't ""cured."" -Lance Dodes M.D. Addiction Doctor

Someday Kratom may not be available for you to try, so if you ever wanted to try it for opiate addiction, the sooner the better.

And for those of you that tried it and did not feel anything you have to do it kind of like subs, you have to wait till you are in withdrawals to start, it is very light compared to the other stuff we take: ie-subs, methadone, heroin

Saved my life and want your life saved too. Whatever it takes..

I am an addict. I accept that fact. I am in extreme pain from a broken metatarsal fracture on the pinkie side. 

I asked for pain medication, as I am on suboxone trying to fix my life. The buprenorphine does not provide pain relief.   

I care about my life and I talked to my pain management/suboxone prescriber and he said it was alright to stop the suboxone to get pain medication to be effective for my broken foot. 

They refused any pain medication of narcotic nature. I was not looking for a high. I'm in extreme pain and needed help, and was refused. 

I am not angry. Just upset that I'm labeled as a drug seeking addict and refused help for my pain.

7cytvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7cytvq/deal_with_the_devil/,21,https://redd.it/7cytvq,sloan_fitch,Deal with the devil..,"Last Sunday I was summoned while in light WD to fix a wifi problem for my friend's sister. They wanted to use a streaming web app and they had some trouble. So I installed a range extender (which I will be taking back after I run a long Ethernet cable to their bed room with a shittier AP) and configured official premium channel apps to work on her fire stick.

The cable TV web app that lets you get the channel line-up without a cable box was not working so well because the laptop was shitty. It was given to her out of my trash heap as a birthday present from her mom and siblings that I configured for her.

So I decided it would be easier to give her a more powerful laptop from the trash heap. Nonetheless, I spent time and I did some good work so she got me a sub. Later that week she's bugging me on a friday evening after a long day and I'm just like ""I need to wind down, I had a long day and I just found out that I need to wake up at 6AM tomorrow.""

That evening she bought it up a couple of times how she helped me out last week but she didn't bring up much detail. Two nights later after a twelve hour work day I bought her an HDMI cable. Although it was free, I indicated that it cost me money. She asked me to bring it for use with a blu-ray player. So when I handed it to her she asked me if I could come up to help her with it.

&nbsp;

Upon explaining to her how simple it would be to plug the HDMI cable into her blu-ray player she explains she wanted help with the cable TV web app which I had already told her I'd address the following day. 

I explain to her that I'm currently setting up a new laptop to give to her and she brings up the fact that she already helped me and I'm like ""I got you, and you already have the HBO apps on your fire stick, use that for now..""

She then bugs me more. Brings up how she helped me the week prior with Suboxone and I'm just trying to shut her up because I didn't tell her brother that I got a sub that day. 


&nbsp;

Why would I withhold this info from my friend? When I need him to get subs, he'll give me dope or pills and assure me that he'll get subs then often fail to get them. Last time I needed him to get subs he lied about being in contact with someone who had subs and never got subs when I needed. In times of the past, I've had WD from fent laced dope and had to suffer through work so it's important that I get subs when I ask for them and am willing to pay for them.

I've shared subs with my friend before but this time around I wanted to have something that he wasn't aware of so that I'd have it on deck when I would otherwise be in a bind. As a result, I now have a half a sub left when I otherwise would've been dope sick at work on a cold day.

&nbsp;

So now, when I deliver her laptop I still gotta be nice because she may be my only easy sub connect. I'll pay cash so she can't hold it over me. I'll also carefully explain to her how she's an asshole for saying that she helped me get a sub when I needed it in front of her brother when she knows damn well that I didn't share it with him while he was under the weather.

&nbsp;

For the work I've done I should get multiple free subs from her for fuck sake. She likely bought it up in front of her brother get me to hustle since she was putting me in a bad and awkward spot. I was forced to explain it away in some busllshit way which I managed to do effectively.

&nbsp;

Once I give her this workign replacment laptop tonight she better shut the fuck up. I'm also installing the same OS to a spare hard drive in case the hard drive currently in that laptop stops working. Why would it stop working? The other day when she pissed me off I dropped the laptop and side-kicked it in my frustration right after she left the room. So I expect the HDD to be unreliable and possibly to stop working. The plan is to be prepared to swap in a working replacement immediately after she calls me when it stops working. This'll allow me to expend the most minimal effort when that time comes.",1510693861.0

So, I've done dones with kpins, I've done dones with xanax, but today it came to a doubt, should I cut the done by half and add a 0.5mg xanax to the mix? Is this mix worth it? Yeah, I know its pretty dangerous, but my tolerance to both is high, I popped 190mg of morphine oral, with 1mg xanax and a bunch of promethazine, like 125mg, it barely did a really good nod, so my question is, methadone+xanax worth it? or better stick to the dones and let xannie away?

I think that this question is born of the type of thinking that keeps people away from treatment...i will explain:

If addiction is a medical issue (I don't believe it is a disease, but I do believe that the only real way to deal with opiate addiction is medically), then why is it so scandalous to bring ones children to the clinic?  We would never say it was inappropriate to bring a child to the urgent care with us if we have a sore throat.  The fact that we feel this way doesn't bode well for the future of treatment in this country.

Take it a step further:  how many people avoid the methadone clinic (which, along with suboxone/subutex, is the gold standard in opiate dependence treatment these days, much more effective than fancy rehab or 12 step programs) because it makes them look like ""a junkie""?  I suspect that is why so many people avoid treatment for so long...as long as your addiction is a secret, you never have to face it yourself.  This attitude will kill several people in the US today, and will kill hundreds this year.  

We need to drop all the stigmas.  Sure, there are people who are former or current criminals at the clinic, but would they be criminals if the drug war was ended?  If their drug was available to them in a clean, supervised place, and at a non-prohibition inflated price?  The vast majority would breathe a sigh of relief that they could now get this drug without fear of violence and poisoning at the hands of black marketeers, and then, most importantly, find legitimate work.  This is not theory.  It's what has happened in Portugal.  It's happened in Switzerland and the UK.  It's about to happen in Canada.  

It can happen here.  We just need to be vocal, and not waste any time or energy fighting each other, claiming that I ""may be in the methadone program, but I'm one of the GOOD ONES"".  Fuck that.  We deserve to have health and happiness like any other American.  ",1510683344.0

I figure there's no better person to ask than users themselves.

I recently started staying with a family friend to take care of him. This guy let a couple of people stay the night a few months back and they never left, they offered to pay him $100 a month per person for rent if he would let them crash on his floor. Since I've been here only one person has paid anything towards rent and it was only $30. He makes $700 on social security though he's not disabled, he's just a heavy amphet user and he's only 29 years old. Last month the disabled home owner called him on his shit and told him that he knew he was doing meth and that rent came before his drugs or he would be out on the 1st. The first came & went and he paid $30 in rent and the rest of his money went to pay a methamphetamine debt that he accrued during the month. These two individuals don't work, they constantly rob, lie, & steal. They scream and fight 24/7 and it's over the smallest most petty shit. I caught them in the shower getting busy and they were screaming & fighting while fucking each other, I don't understand it. I can't bring my son here out of fear that these people are going to bring down legal hell on this house. Another family member lives here and her young daughter sleeps in the same room that these people crash in and they're up all day & night screaming at each other in front of her and they're exposing her to things she should never be exposed to. We have all told them to get out by xXxX date and when that day comes they always have some shirty excuse about how they're waiting on their ride to get here or ""we're getting our apartment next week and we'll be out."" But next week never comes. I have helped pack their items and taken them to the porch, but they always play this mentally disabled individual and make him feel so bad that he stays up crying at night. I've confronted them about their use and actions but they refuse to listen. They both actively and regularly lie about their use (DAILY) and tell us that they're not using while they can't sit still, they're talking so goddamn fast that they choke themselves up, and it's beyond obvious that they're using. I put my foot down and told them this shit doesn't happen here anymore, if they're going to use they can do it elsewhere as they're endangering everyone in this house and opening them up to legal repercussions. The police are very aware of who they are as one is being investigated for robbing a restaurant on Halloween. I work 2 jobs and I have a son that I can't bring here because of their use & behavior. Every night we are all awoken by them screaming at each other in front of our rooms (or walking in our rooms) and turning the lights on and off like a goddamn light show. It's like experiencing night time & day time 100 times an hour. These people weasel their ways back in by playing the disabled home owner and he's so sick of them, along with everyone else, that it's affecting his physical health and has put him in the hospital for chest pains & anxiety. Calling the police to evict them is less than ideal as we have no idea what they've hidden or what they've done, they would no doubt try to pin their drugs/contraband on someone else. 

How do we go about getting them out when they're horribly manipulative and refuse to go willingly or with help.

TL;DR I need an Amphetamine users perspective on how to deal with 2 users who refuse to work, lie, steal, and bum off of everyone they meet. They scream & fight every minute that they're awake and it's affecting the household & the children. They're extremely toxic & refuse to leave or even try to help out. Calling the police is less than ideal in this situation.",1510680287.0

For me it was those old Oxycontin pills that you could just straight up smash up and snort. I think it was a 15 if that's a thing? Only ever done oxy a couple times but I'm nearly certain it was 15mg pills. 

Sat in my front room, crushed up two and split them into lines with a mate of mine (who funnily enough was trying DMT for the first time). I remember being particularly careful as I was worried about overdosing and had been told it was common to spew the first time on opis. 

I still remember that first ever buzz coming on, it was nice and mellow and I just felt fucking fantastic, not a care in the world, watching this dude have his mind blown to pieces by the DMT. 

After that I walk him into town to get his bus and he looks like he's been skullfucked by a freight train. 

All in all a decent time and thankfully wasn't sick! 

Funny to think that it was simultaneously the first time he had a full blown spiritual experience that he still speaks of and the first step on my road to addiction. Now I'm sat smoking a gram of H a day... Good times!

Anyway, the doctor felt real bad about that so he prescribed me a BUNCH of percocet i‚Äôm honestly surprised the pharmacy let the order go through. (Then again, this was 9 years ago) 

I remember coming home and my jaw hurt so bad, the doctor said i could take 2 at a time. The strongest thing i had ever fucked with was extra strength Excedrin so this really was a shock. 

After they hit me, i remember thinking ‚Äúwow, so **this** is drugs? Cool, i want to be doing that *always*.‚Äù That was the greatest 2 weeks of my life, then they all ran out üòî.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I'm a finance major in one of the top 10 undergraduate business programs in the country (not trying to brag, just trying to set the stage for how out-of-place this was) and I had an absolutely BRILLIANT idea today.  Since I had an exam, I decided that I would mix the last of my dope into a large shot and bring it with me to the business school building where my class was, and boot up in the bathroom beforehand.  I've never shot up in a school building (and never will again) and I had just finished lifting, so I was wearing a pair of old sweatpants.  I walk into the building, and about halfway to my class I put my hand in my pocket and realize the rig I loaded is not there.  I check the other pocket in bewilderment, but it's not there either, and I'm SURE I put it in my pocket.

I presently break out in a cold sweat as I feel a small hole in the pocket of my pants, and realize that somewhere on the 5 minute walk from the parking garage, past the campus police station, and into the business school, I have shedded a syringe loaded with what is unmistakably heroin.  Of course I turn around and begin to retrace my steps.

At this point, I feel it is necessary to point out that the building which houses our business school is one of the newest buildings on our campus, and is basically where my school pours most of its money.  To set the scene, we're talking marble floors in a huge atrium with a giant statue of one of the famous politicians who attended the school standing in the middle.  In short, this is not the type of place where you find drug paraphernalia.  Yet as I'm retracing my steps, I spot the orange cap to my loaded syringe sitting just inside the doors of the main entrance to the building.  I'm immediately struck by extremely conflicting emotions: on the one hand I am happy/relieved to have found it so fast, and I know it must have only been sitting there for a minute or so.  On the other hand, I realize that if I can see this loaded syringe sitting DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE of this nice marble floor from 50 feet away, just about anyone else can too.

It is here I know that Junkie Jesus was looking out for me, because despite this rig falling somewhere it could not possibly have been more visible, which also happens to be the area of the business school which sees the most foot traffic, not a single soul walked through those doors between the time when I dropped it and when I saw it.  I mean, it could not have been any more obvious.  There is a desk where a receptionist sits just inside the doors to direct visitors and help people, and had she been sitting at her desk, this rig would have been in the middle of her field of vision.  But mercifully, nobody saw it.

As I walked over towards it, I actually debated (for all of 3 seconds) whether I needed to just leave it, because I was worried someone HAD seen it, and was simply waiting to see who would come back to pick it up.  But then I realized 1. This is the last of my dope and I am not leaving this super-dank shot sitting on the floor, and 2. There will be a fucking shitstorm if someone comes and finds this thing sitting there.  Thinking fast, I went and picked it up, and then went outside, reached into my bag, and threw out a used rig I had in my backpack as discretely as possible, so that if someone actually was looking, I would look like someone who found a loaded syringe on the ground and decided to do the good thing and throw it out.

From there, i quickly went into the bathroom, did my shot (was slightly ruined by the fear the cops were going to swoop in at any moment), and then threw out every stitch of paraphernalia I had with me or on me.  I am never bringing anything with me on campus again.

Job is going terrific. 3 places want me to work for them right now because of what I can do. My arm is infected right now from being in the ocean w a cut and I guess I got some bacteria in it, so I took the day off work. I got SO MUCH accomplished. I was just writing in my diary how good everything is going and how good it feels to get so much accomplished in one day. So many little errands that I‚Äôve been meaning to take care of. Back when I was junkin‚Äô, even if I made a fucking phone call that I had been meaning to make, I felt accomplished. Was thinking to myself how nice tomorrow will be now that I got all of this shit done and I can just chill all day and watch movies and whatever. 

So job going good. No drugs for 6 months (yay). Getting stuff done in life. Been working out like a motherfucker and feel fit as fuck. Looking really good. My best friend today also just asked me to be his best man at his wedding, something I never thought anyone would want me to do...

Also- been banging this HOT AS FUCKING FUCK girl lately... I showed one of my buddies a pic of her and he didn‚Äôt even believe I could get a girl like that. He thought I was lying. Kinda felt good man. Anyway, girl wanted me to get an std check. Now, I honestly don‚Äôt have that much sex with different people and I was just checked (clean) last year, so STD check wasn‚Äôt super high on my priorities... I‚Äôm not showing any symptoms or anything. The girl just wanted us both to get checked so we could bang without condoms. So, getting checked was not even on my fucking radar until she brought it up the other day...I was just gonna do it more as a courtesy to her than anything else. 

So I‚Äôm out doing my errands. Finish the last thing I wanted to do that day. It‚Äôs late in the afternoon and I happen to be like directly across the parking lot from the clinic and I think ‚Äúfuck it, one last thing for today then I‚Äôm going home‚Äù.  

I walk in. It‚Äôs a free clinic. I just checked the boxes of the shit I wanted to get checked for and waited a couple minutes until they called me back. Pissed if a cup. Pricked my finger for blood. As we were waiting for the ‚Äúinstant‚Äù blood test thing to show a result I did more paperwork. As we were doing paperwork I saw the nurse guy glance at one of the strips that had blood on it and I noticed his demeanor change a little bit. He was kind of stern when I first walked in. Very terse and short. I was probably his last person for the day as it was almost 5 and he probably just wanted to get the fuck out of there. After he glanced at the strip his voice softened. His eyes became kinder. He said nothing and continued with questioning for his paper work. I dismissed it as me being paranoid. In a couple seconds he was gonna tell me that I was all good and send me on my way....

After the paperwork was done he looked at me and said ‚Äúok...let‚Äôs talk about your results‚Äù

Me ‚Äú...k‚Äù

Him ‚Äúso this strip is for HIV....you are negative‚Äù

Me ‚Äúpraise Jesus‚Äù

Him ‚Äúthis other test is for hep C....‚Äù

Me ‚Äú....‚Äù

Him ‚Äúi have some news for you...you are positive for hep C‚Äù

I was waiting for him to smile and tell me he was fucking with me and that I‚Äôm good and free to go. He didn‚Äôt. 

Fuck. 

God fucking damnit. Are you fucking kidding me?

He says there‚Äôs a 20% chance it was a false positive and they would have to draw actual blood instead of doing finger prick to know for sure but since my veins are totally fucked they were unable to do it. I‚Äôm gonna have to pound water and go for a run then go in tomorrow to have blood drawn to know for sure. 

You guys are the first to know. I haven‚Äôt even told my mom yet. I‚Äôm extremely upset about all of this.

So there I was, fantasizing about how great it‚Äôs gonna feel to get ALL my errands done and actually be able to chill on my days off instead of running around doing shit... and now I gotta go give them blood and probably get treated for hep fucking C. Not to mention break the news to this girl. 

I just can‚Äôt believe it. I mean, I even went and got a fucking flu shot today just because that‚Äôs the type of shit normal adults do! I mean, FUCK!

Fuck me, fam. 

Ain‚Äôt that some shit? 

As always, thanks for reading. 

Also- let this be a fucking lesson for everyone out there. Even after you get clean as fuck and you have your life back together... the life still has a way of catching up to you. One way or another, the piper gets paid. ",1510805375.0

I have transverse Myelitis ( similar to MS ) and I am in pain throughout the day. I've tried everything and the only thing that seems to help is weed, fenatyl patches, and oxycodone. I was using the patches but the price for them got out of hand, 400-500$ for a months worth of patches (tf?). Oxycodone is cheaper and I am able to go throughout my day unlike weed which I only use when I am going to sleep. I was told to go to Pain Management to get my script back but I'm unsure on if I'll get the amount I was getting. I'm a female, 4'11"", and weigh around 81 pounds. I haven't had insurance in a while and I've just got it back again so I've mainly been relying on Kratom for a whole year. I've tried to use mainly Kratom but I've gotten fired from three different jobs solely because they would no let me sit and I would be in tears crying because the pain would get bad. Not to mention I have to wear a diaper my whole life because this disease messed up my bladder and I'm only 22. I went to a general practice doctor a week before and he's known not to give any pain pills but he was understanding of my pain and didn't give much but gave me ten 10mg oxycontin. I'm worried about pain management mainly because of my age, height, and weight so they wouldn't give me any or even close to my script. I also went to the ER a month before and they even gave me a script for 12 10 MG Oxycodone ( which again they never give pain pills but still was understanding of my situation ). I thought my tolerance would go down but because of the Kratom, one or two did nothing for my pain. I could take 3-4 10 MG Oxycodone and it would manage to bring my pain down to where I can function a bit normally. I honestly don't know what to do, I still live with my grandparents and they want me to get another job but it's too hard so I'm unsure on if going to Pain Management will even be beneficial. Not to mention, because I smoke weed, they would probably turn me down because I live in Georgia and weed is illegal here unless you have a medicinal marijuana card but even if you do have it, you can only carry CBD oil with 5% THC. Does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone tell me how a first appointment with PM will go?

EDIT- Its funny because of a few things I mentioned all of a sudden people think im rolling in thousands of dollars of cash so let me clarify, firstly I went to a saudi arabian rehab center thats literally a fucking ""jail rehab"" if you can call it that and stayed there for 30 days. Yes I live in a house with maids but please please please dont assume I have thousands in CASH in my wallet, I had to sell my phone to get money to buy dope. Maybe I did not explain it well enough my situation at home is so unbelievably strict, extremely controlling that it feels like my self freedom is taken away, im literally in jail at home, FYI i am not allowed to close the bathroom door. I cant make a step or move if my mom is not home without calling my mom and letting her know, all phone records are looked at, all money is accounted for.. think about collecting money here and there over a months time to go buy? forget about it because EVERY SINGLE DROP OF CASH is accounted for. and ya those two maids alot of you keep mentioning are basically my moms general and lieutenant they watch my every move, not even a fart is made without my moms knowledge. I honestly dont understand the hate I have received just because my mom has two house maids, just like you I slept in the back of a shitty car. This lifestyle at home has drained me, and has made me nothing but a soulless human being. I came here looking for help because I have no one to talk to and everything is bottled up but it seems some people have envied me instead.

But then I always stop myself. Because I remember what it was like to listen to that kind of bullshit.

More specifically, I remember how I felt when I was still using, and would stumble upon some insufferable blow-hard touting his new sober life, urging me into the light with his own personal brand of aggressive positivity. Somewhere up there, I‚Äôd imagine, high upon his towering soapbox, there were an abundance of good intentions. And I guess to be drunk on sobriety is better than the alternative. But, personally, I‚Äôll pass on that lecture. Good for you, high-five, two thumbs up.

Fuck, man. I knew my life was shit. I knew there was a better way to do it. You didn‚Äôt exactly need to be an enlightened yogi to tell me that.

Regardless, whether I was reluctantly squatted in a metal chair at a 12-step meeting or browsing r/opiates (or, god forbid‚Ä¶ r/opiatesrecovery) this kind of method in egging people toward recovery did not sit right with me, and still to this day, does not. 

So, rather than go from the familiar bad life / good life dichotomy I‚Äôd rather attack this a different way, and merely bring to light a certain concept I learned through my struggles. One that I would never have had the luck of learning without suffering through my addiction to opiates. And my hope is that it can help someone regardless of whether they are trying to quit or not.

Long before my addiction, and even before I had even used any drugs at all, I was a sophomore in high school sitting in spanish class. I was lucky enough to have one of the coolest teachers around, Mr. Durazo. From students to staff, everybody loved Mr. D. 

He had a very sly talent of bestowing some solid life advice on his students. And in retrospect, his main goal may not have been to teach us Spanish but to prepare us for real life. Anyway, one day the topic of drugs came up in class. There was a recent weed bust at the school, and a several kids got expelled. It was such a hot topic at the time that no teachers were even attempting to graze the subject with a 10 ft. pole. But not Mr. D, he took it head on and had an encouraged open discussion about it. 

Sooner or later the topic delved into harder drugs, and before long, heroin came up. I am going to paraphrase here because it was a long time ago, but he said something to the extent of: 

‚ÄúYes, of course, there‚Äôs all the standard reasons to not use a drug like heroin, like overdose, needles, health reasons, etc. But, in addition to all of that, I‚Äôd imagine it would also leave somewhat of a... ‚Äòlonging,‚Äô if you will. Like a hole that could never be filled again. That is to say, I‚Äôd be worried that the experience would be so good and so pleasurable that no other future life experience could even compare. Just think about it! It‚Äôs not like your brain would just forget how heroin felt! Every single fun, happy, or pleasurable experience thereafter might only be judged in comparison to that one amazing time I did heroin, and thereby making that experience relatively less enjoyable.‚Äù

Pretty god damn insightful for a person who has presumably never used heroin before.

At the time, I remember not thinking too much into it. I had hardly started getting into pot at that point in my life so my opinions about drugs weren‚Äôt a priority. I don‚Äôt know why it even stuck with me after all these years. So, I didn‚Äôt really give it much thought, but I understood what he meant.

Basically, this kind of suff:

‚ÄúWow, that sex was great‚Ä¶ well...I mean, it wasn‚Äôt like heroin great, but it was still good.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat an amazing hike that was, look at the view! What an experience! Ya, not a heroin experience, but still great!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis movie is pretty enjoyable, it would be better with a side of opiates though.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan! What a relaxing shower after a hard day‚Äôs work, ahhh nothing could make this any better, well‚Ä¶ aside from heroin.‚Äù

I think you get the picture. Mr. D was looking at repercussions a different way. In essence, he expected there to be an asterisk next to everything good that happened afterwards, denoting, ‚ÄúWell, not as good as heroin.‚Äù

At the time, I did think he had a good point, but I didn‚Äôt think he was entirely correct. I thought someone who tried heroin could probably compartmentalize each life experience afterwards and judge each experience on it‚Äôs own merit rather that how it fared compared to heroin.

Only problem there was that I was wrong.

It absolutely can diminish some of my more relaxing or pleasurable activities I do today. For example, maybe after a tough day laying in bed the idea creeps in ‚Äúthis would be way better opiated.‚Äù Or the glow after sex, ‚Äúthis is kind of like a heroin rush, but heroin would last way longer.‚Äù 

Before I proceed, I just want to be clear that these are very minute, fleeting, subconscious feelings of ‚Äúit could be better.‚Äù They aren't actually thoughts that I‚Äôm saying to myself in my head. That would make it more like a craving. I can‚Äôt express enough how different this is from a craving. There‚Äôs no emotion or urges tied to it.

A long time ago, I watched a CNN documentary about a guy was about to die from a heart complication. He had only a matter of hours or days left. Then one doctor came out of nowhere and was willing to do an experimental surgery on him, and it ended up saving his life. The guy said he went into that surgery expecting he was never going to wake up. And then when he did wake up and realized he was going to survive, it was the happiest and most exhilarating moment of his entire life--which means a lot coming from a 70 year old.

When I saw this I was like, ‚ÄúDamn, I get that feeling several times per week. Sitting in my car, hardcore withdrawing, desperate, panicking. Literally feeling like I‚Äôm going to die. Then I get the ‚Äúcome thru‚Äù text and I am on top of the fucking world.‚Äù

Whether it‚Äôs that or simply shooting up, that kind of euphoric exhilaration is absolutely unparalleled. I have yet to find a thing, person, place or thing that can instantaneously have me believing that all my problems were gone and I was on top of the world like these kind of instances did. That kind of instant gratification just doesn't exist outside of chemical manipulation of your neurotransmitters, in my personal experience at least. 

I sometimes do miss those times. But I am glad they‚Äôre gone, because with the highs come the lows. But, funny enough, the lows in my addiction are what help me the most now.

Which brings me to the flipside of this concept--in the same way that my addiction has been able to make certain things comparatively less enjoyable, it has, to an ever greater extent, made almost everything in my life comparatively less worrisome, troublesome, and unpleasant. This has helped improve my life drastically. I‚Äôm more comfortable in my skin, more confident, less fearful and anxious.

It‚Äôs hard for anything to really phase me like it would have before my addiction. Anything, and I mean anything, I might have to struggle though today is exponentially easier in comparison than the shit I had to endure in the worst of my addiction. 

Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain? Meh, I'll suck it up and get it done, no biggie. 
Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain‚Ä¶ in withdrawal?! Fuck. That. Noise. 

Have to walk down the street to get the mail? Minor inconvenience, possibly even enjoyable.
Have to walk down the street to get the mail, while you know there‚Äôs people out there looking to fuck you up because you haven‚Äôt paid them back yet? Ah, yeah, i‚Äôll wait ‚Äòtill it‚Äôs dark. 

Get pulled over by a cop for busted tail light? Whatever, take the fixit ticket. 
Get pulled over by a cop for a busted taillight, with a quarter ounce of freshly copped dope under your seat.? Time to start panicking.

These are just a few easier examples. This idea even extends to things that don‚Äôt have a direct situational comparison.

Boss yelling at me for something I had no part in? The world will not end. It won‚Äôt even ruin my day now.

Loosing my job? That would freak me out before, that shit wouldn‚Äôt even affect my sleep now. I lost more jobs in my addiction than I can count. And if I got through it then, I can definitely get through it now.

Can't pay rent because my shity minimum wage job is cutting hours? Eh, not ideal, but I can handle it. I‚Äôll crash at my sister‚Äôs or just sleep comfortably in my car for a bit. Nothing too bad. What‚Äôs bad is living on the streets in the winter with no money, dealing with cops, having to steal to get drugs, having to look over my shoulder.

The ups and downs I went through in my addiction have had the unintended effect of centering me, insofar as the relatively minor ups and downs of my life today seem so god damn insignificant. And if you've never felt that way before, let me tell you, that feeling is empowering as fuck! I feel more like a rock now and less like a feather. I feel more solid, my emotions are not subject to whichever way the wind blows.

So all in all, there are some negative consequences from my drug use that have persisted, but they are far outweighed by the positives I‚Äôve taken away. There was a point in my life, when I was living in a small walk-in closet of a trap house, in withdrawal, out of money, no health insurance, freezing cold, fleas everywhere, trying to sleep and failing, anxious, desperate, and demoralized. I had lost everyone who ever cared about me, no one would talk to me anymore. When I felt beyond lost, at an impasse, with only one more option available. For the first time in my life, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúBeing dead wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.‚Äù 

When it comes down to it, fear is useful for us as humans because it helps keeps us alive. But what if we no longer want to be alive, what then? Well, then fear loses its main purpose, and it feels a bit lighter. I felt comfort in that. Looking back, it was in this moment that I learned fear was more a condition of perception rather than something intrinsic. It was optional. And nothing but going to the deepest, darkest place would have been able to show me that. 

No longer in my addiction, there is no outside circumstance in the universe that could make me feel the way I felt that night. All of life's problems seem so insignificant in comparison to the time that was so bad that death was a better alternative to living. There is no person, no situation, no circumstance today that could rival the utter hopelessness of what I felt that night. And the fact that I survived that makes me feel like I can survive anything.

You are the only one that can decide if your life will be better without opiates. I‚Äôm not here to tell you my life was bad, now it is good, and you're stupid if you don't live the way I do. I just wanted to share with you something I learned along the way, something that has had a positive impact on my life. And the cool part is that it‚Äôs just a perspective--not a program, or a step, or a self-help booklet. Just a different way of looking at the struggles you may be going through. It doesn't have to be that you are broken because of what you've been through, it can be that you  are stronger because of it.

Strong swords are forged in fire. Keep that in mind.

Unlike fent, the withdrawls do not come until around 24 hours. Do they say white China on the east coast isn't smoke able because people just don't do that or does it literally not burn/cause smoke? Lately I've been hearing about down the boarder they have been making white, and slowly it's getting around the west coast...

I'd vowed to never do one without the other, but I fail that every time I try to quit opiates but that combination is a total match made in heaven. 

What confuses me though is the sheer contrast of it all. For example, I distinctly remember trying, buying and then smoking a new brand of cigarettes (idk if you guys have Winston Blues there)  that seemed really good while I was all fucked up on Oxy, but the next day all out of drugs I had a puff on one of my final Winstons and it was fucking gross. I ended up giving the rest of them away for a single Marlboro, I couldn't bear the taste of them. 

This has been something that's happened to me many times. Don't get me wrong either, I am not at all a picky smoker - I'm not one of these ""I only exclusively smoke Lucky Strike and will go through nicotine withdrawals before taking a puff of anything else"" assholes. On heroin, good cigarettes & tobacco tastes like the pussy of the holy spirit, and even awful tobacco & cigs will taste fine. 

So it's not just the fact that they feel better or that the nicotine buzz is enhanced and has a lovely synergy with opiates - although by god that is all correct - but its honestly as if the actual physical taste of the things change. It's weird because IME for everything else my sense of taste is slightly dulled on opiates, but the taste of cigarettes changes radically for the better.

Anyway, I'm still having a considerable amount of pain so my dr switched me from fyntanyl to morphine today. My question is...do I need to take the morphine directly after I remove my patch or wait a certain number of hours before taking it? I forgot to ask the dr & am hoping someone here knows.

I have an extensive drug use history, it would be easier to list the ones I haven't tried. Save all of the ""don't do it"" responses I have tried several (pharmaceutical) opiates before but would still consider myself ""opiate naive"". As far as becoming addicted goes I don't think it will be an issue for me. I know how dumb this sounds. I say that because in the past when I dabbled with oxy I would purchase 100 at a time and do them daily until they were gone without any desire to purchase more. The only notable WD symptoms I would experience are a couple sleepless nights and some irritability. It has been about a year since Ive have done any opiates and I would like to try something different this time. Any opinions or advice from experienced users would be greatly appreciated.

It has been gruelling, exhilarating, rewarding, punishing and not as big a deal as people would have you believe. I just need to get some shit off my chest and whose collective shoulder to cry on could be better than my fellow rejects' ? I'm hoping to demystify the billion-dollar industry that is recovery with this post, and who knows some of you might get inspired to turn your lives around or at least try (because Lord do I know that my shit is far from fixed).


First thing I noticed is that the key to sober life is basically dividing your day into little segments, carefully balancing responsibilities and leisure time. It doesn't have to be rocket surgery, you're in recovery so treat yourself to whatever hobbies you'd like to indulge in. Don't overburden yourself with a million goals, like losing weight, getting swole, fixing your legal and financial shit all at the same time. It's paramount to happiness that you set attainable goals (fucking Anthony Robbins over here, I know). I just read a bunch, listen to lots of music and watch lots of TV. I socialize at work, do some online dating and that's that. It's hilariously uncomplicated in comparison to shooting dope and coke daily, but this leads us to the next lesson.


Life is gonna get boring. How could it not be? There simply are no better feelings than shooting hard drugs. So you really need to come to terms with the fact that you'll never get the same peaks of unadulterated euphoria again. This pissed me off to no end at first, but after a while, I settled in. The highs may not be as intense, but they're more sustainable. I love reading, and no it will never get me as happy as a shot of good coke, but it won't break me as a person as much either, not by a long shot. So you need to visualize how a mediocre, content life (by junkie standards of course) can be made appealing to you.


And finally. FUCK COCAINE. If you have a coke habit as well as a heroin habit, I got good and bad news for you. First, you won't crave dope as much as you're afraid you might. However, the coke cravings are *real*. Every now and then, I'm overwhelmed by the immense need for a bellringer. Some trivial things which triggered this feeling:

- the vague smell of fuel
- bouts of nausea
- glass tubes
- any white powder period
- ringing/pressure in my ears

All this shit takes me back to last year: sitting on my bed, geeking so hard I'm unable to move, breathing hard, my heart about to give out, vomiting and loading a new shot of girl every ten minutes. Oh I'm still suffering the consequences: my veins are fucked. I never had a problem finding places to hit until I started fucking with coke.


So yeah, fuck cocaine. It's the real devil to beat, at least for me.",1510782692.0

I'm currently almost 6 months sober living in a recovery house. I was using heroin everyday for a few months (sniffed) and got up to about 1-1.5 g's daily because I didn't do anything but use. I didn't work (stole to fund habit) didn't go out just simply sat and used. I have a job right now, 50 hrs week as a cook and about to get a raise so I'd be getting close to 500/week. I'm really bored all the time, I have found some comfort in AA but i feel like it's not enough. Now maybe that's just my brain saying it would like endorphins and that I shouldn't be living a regular life, but i just don't see myself staying clean long term. Not because I can't do it, but because I just don't enjoy it especially once I move out of my recovery house and have a lot more responsibilities and bills.

 I have been talking to my old plug because I really want to use, but I've been torn due to my newfound stability and my family talking to me and stuff is nice. That's really it though. My plan would be to use every once in a while(I don't get drug tested so I'd just have to get high at night when no one would notice in my room) so like once a week or so. I have two back up plans in case I do get caught which would be to go to a detox for 2 days and come back to recovery house (house rules, not an Oxford house) or to move in with my plug who said I can if I have to. The rent at his place would be 350$ a month which is nothing and it would be easy to pick up lol. Anyway that's all the info. What should I do?

 Aside from the social stigma, There was so much about her DAILY struggle and routine that made her feel completely alone and ostracized.

I guess my question is: what about your own story--and I mean anything-- with opis would make you feel less lonely and alienated if you saw it reflected back in someone else's story?

Post an ad on casual encounters and say you're a woman looking for a man (w4m) because a guy most likely isn't going to help another guy get their hands on anything. In your post simply say that you ""need H elp finding some party favors etc...."" Just use that as a base and type whatever else you think might work. Within 5 min I had over 15 people emailing me trying to help. The first thing I replied is ""sorry but im actually a guy but do you think you could still help?"" A lot of them didn't even reply after that because they were just trying to use the desperation of people to get laid but there's always that solid reply that looks promising. Work a little magic and make people trust you and eventually one of those people replying will come through. I met a really cool and normal ass white dude with all the goodies 5 min down the road at a Whataburger and was on the way home within a few minutes. I wouldn't even attempt finding someone posting about selling something because 99% of those are just bad news.

First five years i managed wihout opiates but then a second injury made me turn to opiates to help. Heroin worked, but when fentanyl came around got too dangerous. I also got infections and health problems from unclean street shit. 

I have mental problems, not interested in anti depressants. Not long ago i got ahold of not even a dozen dilaudid pills, a bunch of kratom, and some liquid methadone. I would switch between maintaining on methadone and kratom and once a week when my pain got real bad, shoot a dilly. Would micron filter it and everything. But ive run out. The kratom and methadone keep me well, i take such a tiny amount, 6mg of methadone or like 15g of kratom a day. But the dillies were the best. Theyd wash away my intense sadness.... let me relax and feel less pain for a few hours.

Now im conaidering buying dnm heroin and micron filters and shooting that instead of dillies which i cant get. Im afraid of weird diseases and viruses that even a sterile micron cant filter out. Im paranoid some ISIS al queada taliban fuck is gonna chemical weaponize the junk, theres case reports of people in Vancouver getting strange brain infections from dope in the 2000s. Theres also been a case where they had cut it with bone meal and it gave junkies mad cow. 


I can try to see a pain specialist for some pharma shit... its probabaly unlikely ill get fuck all because i tried to get treatment for addiction awhile back, ots on my public record.so im fucked, im considering travelling overseas to a more liberal doctor if one exists. 

I dunno, any suggestions or anything? I cant see myself wanting to live life without a regular release that a strong fast acting opiate gives me. Its just too painful. Ive suffered alot. I wat to cry and scream sometimes because i feel like nobody will help me. 

Back to heroin? My source is good, its uncut and as pure as can be. I just hate the idea of putting non pharma drugs inside me.... i will probably order it and a milligram scale and try my best to keep it under control. We all know how that goes.

I also got extremely lucky that there was no fent in the dope cause this area is notorious for it. While we were waiting on the plug the dudes let me smoke some crack with them. I had never smoked crack before but it was definitely an experience lol. I can see why people fiend for that shit. Just wasnt for me.

Basically I was walking down to this gas station right by where i work to get a pack of cigs and some snacks. I saw this homeless dude who i see pretty often while walking to work and usually help him out with a cig or some change. He came asking for 1.25 for some beer. I was like you know where the dope is at? ""what you need"" etc etc. I told him and i offered to buy him $10 worth of crack as requested. Luckily his plug delivered so after getting some cash at CVS we chilled in a Pollo Tropical parking lot smoking crack and ripping cigs. The guy pulled up in about 20min which was wayy faster than expected. Everything went super smooth and a did a test bump of both bags and was very pleased.

Some taste like baking soda, some taste like cornstarch and some taste extremly bitter. 

I recently discovered the inactive ingredient section on drugs.com and I noticed this...

""Disintegrants facilitate the breakup of a tablet in the intestinal tract after oral administration. Cross-linking allows enhanced bioavailability of the drug through superior drug dissolution. Without a disintegrant, tablets may not dissolve appropriately and may effect the amount of active ingredient absorbed, thereby decreasing effectiveness.""

It's crazy to think that. 
But in this last year things have admittedly gotten worse once I ""graduated"" to dope. 
In fact.. FUCK this year. It's been one hell of a rollercoaster. 
But aside from my crippling mind state and chaotic home life, there's been one positive despite this all:
My career. 

It's strange to think that huh? 
How does a junkie keep excelling within their career path while descending into the darkness? 
Well..

I'm a cake decorator. 
I have a cool ass job and I'm good at it. I've never excelled so fast at something in my entire life 
(Peep my history if you want to see pics) 
All the negative shit in my life, this skill...this talent..
It keeps me going man. 

I'm a pastry chef and have been doing cakes for 5 years now.
Drawing and art is my specialty. It's the one GOOD gene my parents passed on 
(Makes up for all the other issues I get from them!)
And I find that I can channel the creativity through my cake decorating. 

In the last year alone I've gotten a vast raise, developed a name for myself and I'm now getting moved to a position in which I'll be working on the companies wedding cakes which is something I've DREAMT of. (We do cakes for some pretty big venues in the city I live in) 
Basically, it's a big deal and I developed pride in this 
(*hey I'm allowed to brag about this considering it's the only good thing I got going*) 
The bakery I work for is family owned and I feel as though I'm truly accepted as one of the kin. 
This place is more of a family to me then my actual family. 

This job is everything to me. It really is. 
And let me tell you, this industry..the culinary/restaurant/bakery industry is HARD af to manage working when your in active addiction, specifically when your withdrawing
(*the worst!!*)
There's been many times where I've thought I was so close to loosing this because I'm so heavily addicted to this damn substance and I can't function without it. 

So that being said..
My appreciation for this job and my work is becoming so important it's making sobriety more appealing each and every day. 
I can only imagine how much better I could be if I didn't have this monkey on my back.
I want to get clean and really focus on my talent, especially before heroin destroys my love for this 
(Literally one of my biggest fears...all my other hobbies are squashed) 
So like what the fuck am I waiting for?? 

Eh..it's just such a weird parallel ya know? 

That's all. 
Just wanted to share. 
And I hope I don't come off as cocky or anything? I just really genuinely love what I do and I realize how rare this is. 
They say if you do what you love for a living, you'll never work another day in your life. 

So Fuck you heroin..you are NOT taking this away from me!!!! 
 
Let me know if any of you guys can relate?

I did my research on them and in china itself they do sell them under the translation of tailening and you can even order them online but they will not ship to the US. Makes me think they are all the more legit because of that.

My mission being harm reduction. I couldn't hide any more that I had switched from snorting to experimenting with shooting (for about a month).  My girl, somewhat understanding, I would share some H with her very occasion (helped her with that womanly monthly cramping).

Asked the pharmacist about Narcan.  He seemed confused and just didn't know the procedures to selling Narcan OTC. (The sheer lack of knowledge about this harm reduction to the lead pharmacy tech just shows how neglected addicts are on this side..) So, 10 minutes and several pages of reading, and 2 phone calls later he comes back with 2 small off-orange boxes, then proceeded to let me know that I had to buy 2 of them at a time, and sign some paperwork.  Each of them 2mg so 4mg total.  I'm wanting to keep one for emergencies.  Obviously...

Being how wonderful this community is, and how y'all have been there for me, I'm willing to ship this IV dose of Narcan to whomever needs it most...

in the beginning the drugs are great, they make life better-- but then after some time the negatives start to out-weight the positives...

ive been clean of all opiods (including kratom maintence) for about 2 weeks now, and had my 'final hit' yesterday-- the warm rush was nice sure, but the rest of the day spent unconscious and vomitting... i started drugs because i felt i was hardly living-- couped up in my room with little sources of pleasure/excitement/contentment.

now i realize opiates are the opposite of living, the escapism is seductive for sure-- but they dont make life better; they partially remove you from it; at least for a little while. Then the return to earth is a living hell, with every physical or emotional feeling like a kick in the teeth...

i think im done with this viscous cycle of one foot in one foot out of heroin addiction. part of me is very controlling and my runs never go on for more than a few months before i detox and start up again... its probably the most damaging usage pattern i can think of-- no stability whatsoever...

im ready to move on, after yesterdays binge i decided life has more to offer. Wish me well guys-- 'choose life' xD 

i plan on getting through the days on aderall, and some weed/hash in the evenings with valium used sparingly (for example i tapered off them over 10 days when i last quit, but just took one now as the anxiety of the thought of withdrawals returning was killing me-- fortunately i have 0 symptoms, 1 day didnt seem enough to set me back)",1510855930.0

I‚Äôd appreciate any feedback you can give. I work for a city government parks dept. We have an issue where the restrooms at one of our pools has become a homeless person magnet. The pool is open all year, does not charge an entry fee, and has individual rooms where you can lock yourself in and shower/get cleaned up. In hindsight, this was a bad idea. Homeless people frequently use these rooms as a place to shoot up, have sex, and smear shit all over the walls. One dude goes so far as to take the liner out of the trash can then shit in the trash can. I guess to make it more of a hassle for the staff cleaning it up. The lifeguards frequently find needles stuffed in the drains or hidden under the sink. This pool is also 100 feet from an elementary school. 

My questions are:

1.  What do you think would be the effect of installing sharps disposal containers in these rooms?  Will that signal we are cool with what‚Äôs going on and result in more people showing up to shoot up/blast shit on the walls?  

2. Does anyone have a suggestion for how to reduce the frequency of this undesirable behavior?  We‚Äôre about to just lock up the restrooms for good and make everyone use the other restrooms on site, which don‚Äôt provide any privacy/door locks. More of a locker room type situation. 

Anyway, happy nods and I‚Äôd appreciate any thoughts on this subject.

My friends DOC is speedballing cocaine and heroin intravenously, and while he's generally well educated on harm reduction methods, I was very concerned with how ignorant he was on this particular subject. You can't protect yourself from the many dangers associated with (especially intravenous) hard drug use if you don't know what the specific dangers actually are, after all. I already know the general public, as is typical, is incredibly ignorant when it comes to the dangers/risks of these drugs, but if there are any users on this thread like my friend, as I suspect there are, I hope this brings clarity to the issue and allows for continued use for as long and safe as possible.

The biggest misconception I always hear is that because cocaine is a stimulant and because heroin is a depressant, the mixed signals that are sent to your system/heart are confusing and place significant strain on the organs causing them to work much harder than normal. In actuality, as far as the heart is concerned, having a depressant helps balance the effects of the cocaine and minimize the stress caused by a rapid heart rate. Coke can cause the heart to beat way faster than is healthy, especially in higher doses, often exceeding 200 bpm. When used with heroin, a person's bpm will be much less extreme, minimizing the negative impacts on health while also lowering the chances of an OD. On the flip side, cocaine has a similar relationship in regards to heroin and it's effects on the system; a person is much less likely to OD on heroin while the effects of cocaine are still active.

Ironically, the characteristics that can have positive impacts on safety are the same that make this combination so inherently dangerous. The juxtaposition of effects these drugs have allow for, and often promote, unusually high dosages of each. In particular, cocaine allows one to ingest much more heroin than they would normally. In a situation where only heroin is ingested, depending on an individual's opioid tolerance, there is a point at which the heroin will cause the user to ""nod out"", preventing further use (even if so desired). When cocaine is also ingested, it allows the user to go well beyond this dose, however. Over the course of many hours it's not uncommon for someone to have ingested 2 or even 3 times that of their normal dose of heroin.

Problems arise when the effects of the cocaine begin to wear off. Heroin can last anywhere from 3 - 6 hours while cocaine will typically last only about 45 minutes, rarely exceeding an hour. As the stimulating effects from the cocaine wear off, the effects of the heroin remain undiminished and will persist for a significant amount of time. If the amount of heroin in one's system is at lethal levels when this occurs, an OD is imminent. Luckily, this occurs gradually giving the individual some time to react, however, the cessation of effects is rapid. This is the case for the majority of OD's attributed to the combination of cocaine and heroin.

It is also possible, although less frequent/likely, for the same scenario to occur only with cocaine as the primary cause of the OD. Heroin allows one to tolerate much higher doses of cocaine, and although it helps minimize the stress placed on the heart, exceptionally large doses of cocaine are still going to cause damage and will eventually lead to an OD regardless.

I hope this helps some of you to better moderate your dosing when it comes to speedballing. It can be hard to tell where you're at in regards to your heroin dose while in the middle of this combination. Periodically allowing the effects of the cocaine to completely subside before redosing will help in measuring the safety of your heroin dose.

Cheers! May your nods be safe and plentiful.",1511014417.0

I would like to send out some care packages to a few people who genuinely do not have access to clean supplies for whatever reason. I really want them to go to those who truly cannot get to an exchange or buy online, so please keep that in mind when commenting.

I would like to send out 20 packs to 20 different people. Unless you have a specific request for your pack, each pack will contain:

- 1 10-count package of syringes (choose from 29g/0.5""/1cc or 31g/0.25""/0.3cc)
- 10 alcohol prep pads
- 5 cookers
- 2 tourniquets
- 1 package pre-rolled cottons
- 1 lighter
- 1 fun size package of SPK

If you need any of these supplies minus the syringes, let me know. I can send out as many of those as I want. The only item that is limited are the rigs. I have two boxes of those, hence the 20 packs. I cannot send out Narcan at this time, but I'm working on how I can do that. 

These care packages are absolutely 100% free, no exchange of funds required, but I would obviously need your address to send you one, so you must be okay with that. I will choose the 20 recipients on a first come-first serve basis, but keeping in mind those with a genuine NEED will be first on the list. Packs will ship out before Thanksgiving via USPS in plain, unmarked mailers. **NOTE: At this time, I can only send care packages within the continental United States. I sincerely apologize and hope to have international packs available soon.** Comment below or inbox me if you would like to be added to the list! Be safe out there, fam!

UPDATE 1:30 PM, 11/18 : I've gotten a LOT of responses already! I will be going through comments and messages later today and begin making a list. I will inbox everyone to get their address and preferences for their packs as well as letting you know you will for sure be receiving one.

UPDATE 1:19 AM, 11/19: **As of right now, I have one (1) spot left on my list for someone who NEEDS a care pack!** I have made a secondary list for those of you requesting packs without rigs. This list has unlimited spots. I will be sending a message to every single one of you to confirm your address, special requests and letting you know that you will have a pack coming your way.

I get home which was about 7 minutes after I first put it under my tongue, and I was absolutely smashed off the raw (H, that is), so my pupils were pinpoint.

But I knew from allll my past experiences that it takes at least an hour and 20 minutes for it to *start* kicking in. Again, at least w/ my experience. 

So, I get in the house and my friend and I are just chilling, but he doesn‚Äôt talk much so both of us were just sitting listening to Led Zeppelin. 45 mins after I put the tab under my tongue, dude had left, I put music on on my tv, was listening to Patsy Cline, and I was GONEEEEEE!

Constipation is one of the most common problems good ol‚Äô opiate addicts face and if you‚Äôre like me you have tried just about everything to solve it. 

Whether it was swallowing some pills or some mysterious promising powder, all the way to sticking something or somethings up your butt hoping to finally have that empty colon feeling once again I promise you I‚Äôve been there. It wasn‚Äôt until one time where I didn‚Äôt go for 2 weeks that I said enough is enough there has to be a better way!


Now before I share the secret I must warn you this should be used a last resort or for people like myself who are using enough opiates everyday to bring down a herd of elephants!


What you will need:
Naloxone (Narcan) 
Stool softeners
Fiber gummies
A nasal squirt bottle that can be filled
Some kind of Stimulant I use adderall(optional)
A GOOD AMOUNT OF YOUR FAVORITE OPIATE PREPARED TO BE IMMEDIATELY SNORTED OR INJECTED
Somewhere with a toilet that you can flush many times without being bothered for atleast 20-30 minutes. 



Since you are tranquilizing that elephant in your head everyday(opiate agonist receptors) or so you are also tranquilizing the receptors in your colon that tells your body you need to poop and also gets your colon moving and the stuff inside. 

Now we are going to reverse this process and give it a little push. 

Step 1:
Take 2 of your stool softener of choice(sold for very cheap otc at any pharmacy) 12-24 hours before you decide to go through with this complete bowel clearance. 

Eat 4(chew thoroughly) fiber gummies 12-24 hours before the emptying as well. 

Step 2:

Fill your nasal squirt bottle with about 20-30ml of water depending upon how big the bottle is so that it is about half way filled. 

Step 3:

Take your Naloxone(for me I get the 4mg nasal one shot spray version but any kind will work) and shoot, pray, or pour it into your designated nasal spray bottle(usually some kind of glass vial with a squirter head on top). Try to only put 4 mg. 

Now you should have about 4mg of Narcan diluted in 20-30 ml of water. 

Step 4(optional):
 
1-30 minutes before you want to go poop depending on stimulant used and method of use. Just make sure it is kicking in at the same time as STEP 5. Take your stimulant of choice. 

This is optional as Step 5 should make the average person empty just fine but for heavy users like myself this step is needed. 


Step 5 :

This is the most important and careful step. 

10-15 minutes before you are going to empty squirt about 5-20 squirts of your naloxone water mix into each nostril. The amount used it dependent upon multiple factors such as how much opiates you have in your body at the time or how sick or not sick you are currently. Basically you are going to make yourself just sick enough to get your bowels moving for long enough to have a great poop. But don‚Äôt worry you are going to be well immediately after with step 7. 

Step 6 THE POOP:

Once the naloxone( and stimulant if used) are kicking in, your stomach should be kicking begging you to go at this time. Get on the porcelain throne! I recommend a poop stool, and stool will work to prop your feet up on it really helps.  

Then just give it your best push, my best tip is when something is coming out don‚Äôt stop pushing until it stops because that is your best opportunity to get as much out as possible. 

Don‚Äôt get up yet though flush what you did and wait because there will be more! Usually for me it‚Äôs all out in 2-3 drops. 

Step 7 THE REBOUND:

Now then you are probably feeling pretty horrible at this point if you did this right because of the Naloxone and if you‚Äôre like me praying for death but do not worry ! Soon you will be back to your good old junkie self. 

Once you feel that you have sufficiently emptied your bowels grab the opiate you have prepared hopefully somewhere right next to you and use it! You might need about 50% more than you normally do to get well to completely negate the narcan. I use H snorted and 2 decent sized lines has me feeling back to normal within 5-10 minutes if you shoot you will probably be better even faster. Obviously take care not to do too much no ODING!

Step 8:

Sit on your porcelain throne until you feel good enough to get up and admire your flat tummy and empty feeling colon. 


BONUS IMPORTANT THINGS/TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND:

1. There is no exact amount of narcan or stim. So the first time you do this take it slow just use maybe 5 squirts in each nostril and wait to see how it affects you. Also just try the normal amount of stim you would do don‚Äôt take it overboard until you see how this all effects you. 

2. There is no exact amount of opiates needed to rebound for everyone. Usually you are gonna need a bit more than you usually use but don‚Äôt go overboard if you are not feeling better in 5-10 minutes use more and then again in 5-10 if still not ok. At worst you will be normal in an hour. 

3. DO NOT TRY THIS WITHOUT A GOOD AMOUNT OF OPIATES AT THE READY YOU ARE GOING TO FEEL TERRIBLE DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE IT. 

4. If you sniff your opiates immediately put your tray or whatever it‚Äôs on down because you most likely are going to start sneezing because your nostrils are extra sensitive just like the bowels you just emptied. 

5. Flush after each drop/wipe because as the sickness kicks in the last thing you want is a flooded toilet. 

6. Usually I recommend doing this method no sooner than 3 days apart because you want to build up as much poop in your colon as possible to empty it effectively(the more that‚Äôs in there the easier it is to go trust me). 

7. This is an advanced technique don‚Äôt do it the first time but if you feel you‚Äôre not completely emptying with the pre stim and narcan right before you sit down to drop use 1/3 of the amount of pre stims u used. Again I use adderall. So that by the time you are nearing the end it kicks your stomach one last time to get it all out. 

8. Keep a towel near by you are going to have a little bit of a runny nose and might be sweating. 

Good luck my fellow junkies make the force be in your colon. 

Let me know if you think I missed anything or should change anything this was done on mobile after an adderall induced great shit so I will check it on my computer later.

7drujc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7drujc/cold_copping_my_story/,45,https://redd.it/7drujc,9Lives_1Problem,Cold Copping - My Story,"Wanted to share my story, from when I was brutally sick and had cold copping miracle. It‚Äôs long, but worth it. I‚Äôll certainly never forget.

Back in 2013, I was in Washington, DC for 48 hours on a business trip. One of our larger clients in NYC referred us to a local real estate developer- I flew down with Al, our operations manager, to get the face time needed to lock down a contract. 

My regular dealer in Brooklyn was from DC- when I told him about the trip, he hooked me up with two of his friends in ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù, Frankie and ‚ÄòT‚Äô. Both responded immediately when I texted a week in advance, and I touched down at AIRPORT late Sunday evening feeling like my ass was covered. 

‚ÄòT‚Äô had stopped responding, so I set up a meeting with Frankie near my hotel early the following morning. He never showed... Good to know that dboys are the same, no matter what city. 

**8:30AM**
I didn‚Äôt have time to screw around- the first meeting started in 30 minutes, so I decided to cut my losses and pick up Al from the hotel. Maybe they‚Äôd get back to me in a few hours, I hoped.

**1:00PM**
Al and I walked out of the developer‚Äôs lobby after a morning of fairly dry, but successful presentations. Al was psyched, it seemed like we had gotten the project. But my head was somewhere else.
No good news on my phone- I had even trolled Craigslist in between meetings and not even those scam artists were replying. *Nothing*. 

I dropped Al off at the hotel and parked near the Mall, thinking I‚Äôd grab something to eat and solve this rapidly growing disaster.

The dboy wasn‚Äôt responding, nobody on Craigslist, just *nothing*. Brooklyn hookup said he couldn‚Äôt help. My phone had 1% battery- we both needed a plug, badly.

**1:30 PM**
Like a Christmas present full of dogshit, I had wrapped my junkie body in a suit that morning. People see what they want to see, what they need to see, and passersby did their best to help the sad young man dabbing at his eyes with a handkerchief.

‚ÄúUm... Sir?‚Äù A middle-aged woman in a pantsuit tried to get my attention, walked over with mock-concern and a nasal twang:
‚ÄúSir, do you need help? Maybe directions?‚Äù

*Yes, please die immediately*, I wanted to say. This woman was wasting my precious time- I needed to scour this city for heroin and it would get drastically harder as night fell.

She probably had a half-full bottle of Norcos in the bathroom cabinet from knee surgery two years ago. They made her feel dizzy, she probably said and a few Motrin always did the trick.

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt going away.

I shook my head, pushing away daydreams about this busybody‚Äôs imaginary Vicodin stash. It would take the whole bottle to soothe this headache.

‚ÄúUm,‚Äù I mumbled, benign-but-confused look on my face, ‚Äúwhere is the Lincoln Memorial? I want to go... Pay my respects...‚Äù

Well, that sounded stupid, but I could hardly think. A nice, obvious tourist question. Now she could point me in the right direction and go home, smugly satisfied with herself. And I could get the fuck away.

The Memorial? I knew where it was, about a 3 minute walk- my car was parked nearby. The plan was: drive away, charge my phone and regroup.

Sue (let‚Äôs call her Sue) was pleased. What a poor soul, lost in the nation‚Äôs capital! How lucky, to run into such a helpful, selfless woman! 

She swiveled and pointed, the nascent traces of another question started to spill from her mouth. 

But I was already gone, speed-walking toward the Lincoln Memorial. 

*Fucking Sue*, I thought, pulling at my tie knot.

**2:20 PM**
Heroin was urgently yanking my leash as I approached Abe‚Äôs shadow. A herd of cattle was mulling about aimlessly, disguised as people- but I knew better. *People aren‚Äôt shaped like that*, pointlessly reassuring myself, knowing the truth would only make this sickness worse.

**2:32 PM**
DC was a wash- the 40 miles to Baltimore would be cake in my bitchin‚Äô Chrysler Sebring, courtesy of Hertz. I‚Äôd never been to Baltimore, but knew it would be easier to cop there. Tripadvisor for Junkies, why isn‚Äôt that a thing? I guess nobody would pay for it.

Crowds still stood between me and my rental. Scowling, I blearily scanned the area for an easy exit- suddenly making eye contact with a security guard. The ill-fitting black suit was tastefully accessorized with a dangling earpiece, and humorless expressio... He was probably bored out of his skull. I meekly looked away and moved around the herd‚Äôs perimeter. 

Oh, *fuck.* Two more guards were putting up barriers between the columns at the monument‚Äôs entrance. Another seemed to be pushing the crowd back, away from the road that separated me from my rental. Not good. What the fuck was going on?
The more I looked, the more earpieces I noticed. Barriers. Secret Service? Why?

**2:42 PM**
My dark suit jacket concealed a shirt soaked through with sweat. The path behind me was already blocked. If I didn‚Äôt move quickly, I could be stuck here for hours as these bovine masses showed each other pictures of their grandchildren. That couldn‚Äôt happen. Not now, not today. 

I walked purposefully toward the Lincoln Memorial‚Äôs top steps- the crowd thinned out up here and I didn‚Äôt see any barriers. A group behind me had their phones drawn, happily taking pictures with expressionless captors. Yep, definitely Secret Service and they had their hands full. 

Was there a terrorist threat? Did they think someone was smuggling a pipe bomb in their fanny pack?

Any concern for national security paled in comparison to how badly I needed heroin in that moment. So I made my move, slipping behind a column, and waited for some armed patriot to knock me out.

**2:57 PM**
Nobody came. The din outside faded as I crept deeper into the dark Lincoln Memorial, nose dripping and eyes fully dilated, streaming tears. Looking for an exit, some kind of back door. I‚Äôd sprint to my car, never return to DC. Fuck my job, fuck this business trip... This was beyond what I could handle, I thought, standing behind Honest Abe‚Äôs massive stone chair.

**3:00 PM**
But then I saw him. Standing serenely with his eyes closed, lips gently moving.

President Barack Obama. *Shit.* No security detail. Alone with a dope fiend inside a legendary monument. 
I was overcome with fear. *What the fuck do I do?*

Then his eyes snapped open. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not supposed to be here.‚Äù He murmured gently, seemingly at ease. I shook my head, *no*, totally overcome with fear.
Barack smiled. ‚ÄúRelax. You‚Äôre safe. What‚Äôs your name, kid?‚Äù

I told him and he repeated it slowly, extending his hand, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Barack,‚Äù the president said, ‚Äúnice to meet you...‚Äù he trailed off, staring into my eyes with concern. ‚Äú... hey, are you alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúN-not really, sir,‚Äù I was at my wits end. ‚ÄúNo. I was trapped out there. I can‚Äôt get to my car, I‚Äôm sick and need my medicine.‚Äù Medicine, yeah right.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look so great, kid,‚Äù Barack stepped closer, ‚Äúwhen was your last fix?‚Äù

My jaw fucking dropped. I did what any of us would do: stand there, fully catatonic.

‚ÄúNot good, my friend.‚Äù He grinned, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI always tell folks, always stay a step ahead, because that plug will always fail you one day.‚Äù

Now hang on a *fucking minute*. Barack Obama is a *junky?* No. No way, it wasn‚Äôt possible.

I shivered and nodded weakly.

Without breaking eye contact, Barack felt around in his suit pocket and raised his eyebrows. ‚ÄúWell, how much you got on you?‚Äù 

Was he serious? ‚Äú$200... But. Well. Um.‚Äù I looked at the ground. 

‚ÄúForget it. Take this- I‚Äôm assuming you pay your taxes,‚Äù said the President of the United States, handing me a bundle, ‚Äúand this doesn‚Äôt leave the Lincoln Memorial. Michelle would kill me if she knew.‚Äù ",1510996189.0

I have not taken an opiate in one year and a few months.

First prescribed ops when I was approx 11 years old.   Dealing with increasing physical and mental pain, I began to take more and more as I grew physically.

All throughout my life from 11-22 or so I was taking them, averaging a few times a week.  Sometimes more, at some times less.  Starting with 5s at a young age, eventually getting into over 100mgs.  


So it is now, over a year without them.  I have tried many many things working with my therapist(s), and recently my Dr brought up the concept of suboxone.

  While some medications may have helped for a week or so, I was/am constantly met with the emptiness feeling - BUT not an emptiness of activity or purposef, I have a good job, a fair amount of friends, and in the ""reality"" world I am doing well - I mean emptiness in the sense that I really just miss the feeling the ops gave me, not necessarily the ""high"", just the overall mental feelings of... feeling right, almost like my brain ""needs"" just a little bit to function. This part is hard to describe as I am aware that this could simply just be the demon that is opiates trying to confuse my brain. 

 HOWEVER, due to the very early age of beginning the ops I have been questioning if this ""emptiness"" is in fact a neurological ""necessity"" of some sort of opiate.  Hence my questioning of suboxone.


I wish I could just forget the feeling, but it is too
o late for that.

You guys told me I should quit while I'm not too far into the wabbit whole. So I'm making this post to let you guys know how my life is going since then. In my post I said I don't get paid till next week but I had a few dollars laying around to spare, and I also got $20 for fixing my buddies pc.

So how am I now? Well, I'm currently high, and feeling great.

Now I know what y'all are about to type, ""It'll get you eventually cough syrup druid"" or ""Quit now"" or ""You're a fucking retard and/or homooosapien. and you're probably right, but I plan on quitting opiates for good right before the new year as starting early next year I'll have to give it up to pursue life/career goals anyway, but I'm enjoying myself for now. The way I use I don't go into withdrawal, and I haven't had issues with prioritizing other monetary responsibilities over dope (or other opiates since I first started many moons ago). Also I only go through an acquaintance of mine who is a middle and I don't have any dealers numbers, among a few other precautions to help me not go overboard. 

Also ODB, and some other gentle sir/lady made a remind post for 1 year from now and I will be giving an update then. So if I do get addicted I'll let you guys know. Peace love over and out.

I've given thought to making a post which would serve as an anthology of the meanest comments from my last post. Heck, would've even given positive credit for logical responses where applicable. Instead, I'll focus on the empiracal shit and of course a literary experience for those who wish to indulge in such minutiae. 


&nbsp;


I'm not here to argue the merit or the folly of my actions. Anybody who says, ""go to a real doc and get a prescription"" is right and reasonable. Can I get insurance without all of my ID's and such in order? I suppose there is one way to find out. Perhaps I shall this weekend as I am reaching wit's end. It has been argued that I am a tool and in all fairness my actions do jive with that assessment. Some weeks things go well and I get what I am owed. Other weeks I lay out money and get utterly screwed with nothing to show for it but a story. Some folks enjoy these stories, others get sick of them but oviously read them anyway because they complain about having ""wasted all this time reading.""


**To all of the naysayers:** if you don't like my posts, don't read them. If you feel they're not relatable to this community... go complain to a mod and tell them to revoke my posting priveleges. 

(apologies to mods if some morons inundante your inboxes requesting an end to my right to engage in discourse 'round these parts.)


**BTW, do I write like a young aristrocrat?** I think someone was trying to express a negative attitude in a comment on my last post but it sure felt like a compliment to me :)


&nbsp;

**TL;DR: 1mg sub strip eliminated chills, emotional negativity, and the shits.**


Let's start with something I learned today that can be shared with this commmunity. Yesterday I had two bags decent H and roxy both snorted. Did fine, got thorugh work and had a good night's sleep. Prior to that I was using opioids for at least three consecutive days.


I had a 1mg square of sublingual suboxone so I cut it in half and dissolved it after a light breakfast. Over the following hour I messaged my using ""friend"" to see if he got the bulk order of subs that he was supposed to get at 7AM. No bueno, the goal post keeps getting moved. He even asked if I had any of the sub left. I said no then dissolved the second half of the 1mg strip reamnant. 



&nbsp;


In short, what was learned? That you can get away with using 1mg of suboxone for a mild withdrawal. Not everyone would call it ""mild"" but I believe if you're not IV'ing and you didn't snort 2 buns of fent laced stuff the day before that what you expereince the following day is inded mild. 


Now of course I laid out money so my friend could get subs in bulk. The deal was quite sketchy. It consisted of buying two buns for this other guy's brother so that the sub connect would give us subs on his way to work in the AM and pay some moeny too. Instead, the guys brother picked up the H at 7AM and the sub connect stopped responding to messages at 2pm. 


&nbsp;


Oh and my using friend ""found"" $20 so I fucking snatched that shit up. I'm more likley to succeed in using it to procure more subs but if not at least I have some fucking cash. I was able to confirm bits and pieces of my using friend's story but I'll always be paranoid of being lied to unless I see 30 subs appear on his desk upon my arrival.


&nbsp;


**Take-aways:**


* Listen to your instincts and don't fall for enticing opprotunities. 


* 1mg of sub is enough for mild WD. Past experiences show that 3mg is the most I've ever needed and even then it probabl wasn't ""needed"" in the strictest definiteion of the word.


* Suboxone is a very strong and potent medication, your milelage may vary but there is a lot of mis-information about subs. Some of it comes from doctors and is only applicable to the patient it was given to.


* If you've read this whole post and and are full of haterade, shut up because I gave plenty of opportunities to stop reading and included a ""tl;dr"" statement.",1510962440.0

Edit: Getting my first big test immediately. One of my very best friends died (OD'ed on god damn fent pressed blues) this past week while I was in rehab and the funeral is tmrw at noon CST. On one hand, I'm glad I got out of rehab in time to be there to say goodbye to him. On the other hand, I absolutely was planning on laying low and avoiding most all of the people we ran with in the dope game in our area. I know that I could easily just stay home and have good reason but I know if I don't go it will always bother me deep down. So I will 10000% accept any good vibes you want to send my way tmrw.

I would say it all started this year when at the beginning of the school year I got a bad cold and was prescribed codeine. Basically i feel like it diminished my fear of medicine because i then associating feeling like that with the stuff in my parents medicine cabinet. After a few days of abusing codeine my mom hid it cause I didn't have a cold anymore. Next thing I knew I was looking for more medicine with similar effects. What's funny looking back on it, I was so scared to go over my recommended dose; when I wanted to ""get fucked up"" I would literally add a ml extra. Anyways, my parents are divorced so I go to each one evenly on halves of the week and this was Wednesday so I was going to my dads. As I showed up, i was curious of what he had in his medicine cabinet. One the bottom shelf I just see allergy stuff( and something i used later on called dxm) so then I look at the top shelf. First thing I see is Codeine in the liquid form and thought ""sweet dads got it too, time to party"" then I looked to the right not know what I saw next would control my entire life(not really, it's not morphine or heroin lol). But i saw around 4 bottles; Tramadol, codeine,hydrocodone, and some blood pressure meds. I went straight for the codeine. Did some research online on the starting doses and proceeded to take 2. Felt amazing that night so did the same the next night but added 2 more. Felt great once again. 3rd night, didn't do shit. 4th no reaction to 5 pills. At this point, a lot were missing so I gave up(and around this time I tried the hydros and thought they were as boring as the codeine was). After my experience with codeine I was just looking for something different. I remember looking up Tramadol and immediately seeing ""Snorting tramadol to get high"" and my face lit up. So I grabbed maybe 2 pills put them in a bag and crushed them up in my garage. Then in the garage I set up a line and tried it out. Not really a rush and nothing too cool but it was definitely something omg. So I took to more line before I left and really started to feel it. My face felt a bit numb, my mind heavy, but my head wasn't, and the waves of warmness were very relaxing when sitting still. This lasted maybe 30 minutes to an hour and when it ended I just did another line. Fast forward until Friday. I have band and I take 4-5 pills, crush them up, and put them in my bag so I could have fun at this game. I ended up doing a line in the bathroom before we got on the buses and my friend could tell i was high. On the bus I sat next this friend and she asked for some. I told her you had to snort it but she took a pinch and just put it in her mouth and I did the same a bit later. When it kicked in she was very obviously high and we were both laughing together but then it stopped after 10 minutes and she because a little sick. We tried to redose but found out that it didn't work. Football game sucked and when I got back to the bus I got a fare bit more than before and ended up getting super sleepy but happy. The next day I was very sick all day and then took a weak break. The only reason I got off this easy is because it was very small amounts. The day I started again, I don't really remember. I think it was another football game and instead of crushing the pills, I took 3. This. New. Feeling. Was. Amazing. I decided that day, that ""this was my new drug"". The 3 got bumped up to 5 on the bus and I was extremely sleepy but super happy during the game. Then bus ride home where the 5 was bumped to 7 which was 350mg. That weekend I felt the worse sickness i've ever felt in my life. But the feeling was so great that I started taking them at school. I took at least 3 each day from what I though was 1 week which was actually 2. Now, when I quite, which I have tried, I can not sleep, I don't eat, and I become extremely depressed.

In co-operation with the Federal Criminal Police Office, drug traffickers of the detention center in Ingolstadt, Germany were able to arrest a 19-year-old last week when he was sent a package containing narcotics.

In connection with drug investigations by the Federal Criminal Police Office, investigators of the Ingolstadt Criminal Police Office were informed that an initially unknown person in Ingolstadt should receive a delivery of narcotics by parcel delivery.

Last Wednesday (08.11.2017), the drug detectors then hit. The 19-year-old recipient of the parcel was amazed when immediately after the parcel courier and the detectives were in his apartment with him.

The package included about 5 kilograms of marijuana and 100 grams of amphetamine. During the subsequent search of the rooms, another 1.5 kg of marijuana, about 70 grams of cocaine, numerous LSD trips as well as various merchandising utensils and around 13,000 euros in cash were secured.

As it turned out, the detainee was no stranger to the Ingolstadt Drug Investigators. He is suspected to trade drugs since mid-2015. The investigation continues.

At the request of the public prosecutor's office in Ingolstadt, the investigating judge ordered on the following day on suspicion of commercial trade in narcotics in no small amount the pre-trial detention against the accused.

I guess I'm just curious if anybody knows any kind of answer... like if cartels ship certain things from Mexico so its tar and on the East Coast it's coming from Europe so it's powder is my rough guess. ",1510941566.0

It all started with the passing of my mother in 2013, we were best friends.. I was always so scared to lose her... and my worst fears came to life at the young age of 17.. I found my whole world dead... gone... at 42. After it happened I moved in with my dad and was pumped full of aderall and anti-depressants until I graduated Highschool...Once i stepped out into the real world i found a good paying job and eventually moved out at 19... far to young.... well as the crippling depression set in while sitting in my one bed room apartment I picked up the bottle... that was my first vice but i never loved it... it was febuary of 2016 that opiates entered my life for the first time... In the form of Hydro-Met (cough syrup with hydrocodone).... I was nervous at first but i thought fuck it im going to see if i can get high... i poured an ounce into a sprite and that was all she wrote.... i was getting 16 ounces a week and it would be gone in 5 days max.... Finally my GP caught on and called me out on it and said i have to take a break... but i went to another doc and kept on chugging... Once I looked up it had already been a year and I cant remember any of it... well the new doc caught on as well and cut me off...And now the one thing that numbed the pain and made me feel wonderful was gone.. i actually got sober for about 2 months and was doing good... Until my wisdom teeth... hello hydro... it was a fucking full on nose dive after that... i moved back home...quit my job... found a oxy plug and spent well over $8,000 in 3 months on oxy.... well once the money went dry i began doing what i will never forgive myself for... i was pawning my grandfathers guns, any jewlery... basically anything with value to my family.... well it wasnt long until dad found out... and literally beat my ass... He carried my ass to every pawn shop and got all the stuff back and that was my rock bottom... hurting my only parent like that... he was devestated and cried for days asking for his son back... my sister doing the same... well i guess it snapped me out of it... i told my dad to get ready for the fight of a lifetime because these next few weeks will be hell.... it was the worst thing next to losing my mom... i litterally just turned my familys whole world upside down... well 90 days sober today and i experienced the highest highs and the lowest lows all before the age of 22... cost my family over $5,000 and of course payimg it back slowly because i turned my life around so drasticly that im now a Corrections officer...

I didn't. 

We're explorers, we have so much courage. Sure being a drug addict isn't ideal and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. We have a lot to work on. However, the personality traits that got us there aren't necessarily character flaws. In some ways we are fearless. In other ways we have a big ego. But ultimately we cannot simply be summarized down to a 'bad person'. 


You are not a junkie. You're a dopamine dare-devil. 


PS: Heroin is the worst decision Ive ever made in my life. This post in no way glorifies drugs. It's just nice to have a small break from the constant feelings of guilt and shame and low self worth. If you're reading this and you've never done an opiate, get in touch with me and I can tell you the sad harsh reality of how much this drug has cost me.

First ever opiate habit,  since early september; high dose codeine at least 2 and up to 4/5 times a week until late october/early november where I went through a bit of oxy but more importantly just under 10 evenings of sniffing H in two consecutive binges. Had 5 days clean in there. I was sniffing between .3-.5 a night. 

By my very conservative estimates (30% H purity) I sniffed 150mg at least per evening. 

Prioir to the last binge I seemingly got off scott free but mentally the second H sesh had me far worse afterwords, particularly mentally.

I Lapsed yesterday on the evening of **10 days clean** with 430~mg of codeine and the same this evening after work.

My tolerance seems to have reverted back to near-beginning/pre-october levels. I know I shouldnt push this and i dont intend to (managed to convince myself that since the codeine is being upscheduled a last taste would be passable).

So my question is what do you reckon about any potential impact on WD/rebound. 

With an also conservative (higher rate) metabolism of codeine I consumed two doses equiv to 65mg oral morphine ish. Is this a very small fraction of my very conservative estimate of my nightly consumption of H back in early Nov? I know one night of this likely had no impact but given the two day (two doses, so does this count as similar to a day ish?? Am I overthinking this? Probably) lapse what would you reckon I expect.

Thoughts/advice much appreciated.",1511092824.0

Lifting. Yes, yes I know it's wrong and illegal and I'm a shithead but we stick purely to big chains that can afford to lose it. Not trying to justify what I do but I'm usually flat broke, usually have $3 to my name. I personally believe there's a big difference between stealing from personal people and their hard earned things. I never go that route, no matter how bad I need a fix or how sick I am. I won't even touch non chain, mom and pop type stores. I know it's hard enough for them to compete with monsters like Walmart without shoplifters so I'd feel like a sack of shit going into any place like that and boosting. Anyway to the point.

I used to do LP for the majority of my career and it helps and gives me a lot more inside information than most lifters. I have a general rule that I don't fuck with a place if I know nothing about their security or shoplifting policies. I fucked up out of convenience and broke my rule about a week ago. Didn't know much about the place, but it was a small pharmacy type store of a well known chain. I never have problems at Walgreens and know they don't have LP. I was only going in to get two very very cheap things for personal use, not exactly boosting and low and behold, even though there was not a camera in sight on the sales floor, no one stopped me at the door but 3/4 employees came outside(where there are cameras in the lot) and eye fucked me. 2 hours later a cop comes to my house and gives me a shoplifting court summons and said I was caught red handed on type. I call bullshit and think a sneaky worker saw me at just the wrong moment and either one of them or the camera got my plate number.

Anyway to the REAL point. (Sorry I tend to ramble on posts, especially when I'm high). Said partner and I had plans to wake up early and hit one of the big chains I actually used to work LP at. This place probably brings me 80% of my dope money. You'd be surprised but some of the best stores to hit are the ones who have LP, but even though when I worked there, we were supposed to be there one day a week right at 6am to throw off shoplifters and not make it look like we worked bankers hours. Thing is, it's not really enforced and even if they are on duty(plain clothes) they do on foot surveillance and even if they're good, it's not terribly hard to realize you're being followed. So they open at 6am. We normally hit between 630-645 so at least some other people, mostly contractors, are there. If it's been a while since we've hit said store, sometimes we come back to the car and go back in and hit em twice. It's not until 10am until the pawn shop is open and even though we always hit two separate stores, even if we double dipped in the first store twice, so it's common to come out with 3 loads of concealed mercy. To kill the rest of the time till pawn is open, I'll drive my buddy to clothing stores. Before we met, this was his area of expertise, hardware being mine. Pawn won't take clothes but his dealers take them as a straight trade for dope and usually gives him 30% of the retail value. These guys always want new clothes. 

So between the pawn and the clothes we were looking at a good 6-8 bundles a piece. I had slept 90 minutes the night before and didn't leave myself enough time to get a good nights sleep last night to compensate. Mix lack of sleep with dope, and the fact I'm getting some type of sickness, both of my very loud phone alarms failed to wake me up. I keep in close contact with my mom and since I hadn't heard her texts and responded, I finally woke up when she called...at 210 in the afternoon. Even if we hit the hardware stores that I know have no LP( only 5/11 of the stores in the district are manned by one person), wed never have the time for me to drive 20 minutes to get him, least another 20 to hit the closest store without LP ( since it was the afternoon and the manned stores would have their guys working by now), we'd never make it in time to pawn before it closes st 3pm on Saturdays when they close, and they're closed Sunday. This left us with only with clothes lifting options which nets us less than the hardware alone by far. We decided to take the drive to the king of Prussia mall where he can hit many stores in the area without us driving all over the north of the state hitting separate stores at random. The goal was to get at least 2-3 bundles each as opposed to the 6-8 if we'd done the early morning plan and I'd have fucking woken up, still kicking myself in the ass.

We each got 1.5 buns tonight and will pick up the last bun to split tomorrow. I'll take one my subs tomorrow to conserve dope. I go through at least 2 buns or more a day so with one and a half and getting back late, I could do a good bit tonight and save about 6 stamps to shoot before we lift next chance we get since it'll have to be soon since today we didn't get nearly enough.

Anyway I guess that's my shitpost and end of my rant. I hate switching back to my subs and the longer I've been using dope the worse I feel. I'm sure many know what I mean but in case you don't it basically feels like this. You take your first subs after being in dope and 5-6 hours later (for me) I feel like I HAVE to go to bed. I'll sleep for at least 6-8 hours even in he middle of the day. Might stay up fir about an hour if I need to then I can sleep a whole nights worth. So basically the first day is spent with an almost required sleep and about the first half of the second day. Once you're done sleeping you feel like shit mentally. Yes the subs will make sure you don't get the physical WD but you do feel god awful mentally. Even when you wake up, you don't want to do shit. I can literally be in bed with my tv remote within arms reach and j have no interest in it. I can't be bothered to go to my computer and game, which is usually my favorite thing to do and all I do when I'm home with free time. This lasts a good 3 days before I'd say you're semi back to normal, meaning you can get up and out and do things but it's at least a week, 2 to feel completely back to normal and at least semi content with just being on subs. So I'll get High tonight. Take subs in the morning to conserve and if I'm lucky only have to do that for tomorrow and get back to the boosting Monday... Tuesday if I can't cancel this colonoscopy which I know is going to be useless.

Anyway, hope you all had better days. End of too long rant/vent and shitpost.",1511063561.0

just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. 
thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1511061656.0

7dxlsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7dxlsz/thank_you_jj/,8,https://redd.it/7dxlsz,woahcotrez,THANK YOU JJ,"Just had the scariest moment ever. We picked up before going to thanksgiving/grandma's birthday party.

My grandma's fat ass dog was chewing on something and my aunt asked what it was. I originally wasn't going to do anything about it, but just to appease her I put my hands in his mouth and made him drop what he had. To my horror a cap drops out. She immediately states, ""What the heck is that? Medicine?"" I hurriedly grab it and wrapped it in my hand to throw away. I said, ""yeah it looks like a medicine capsule, I don't know how in the world he got it but I'll throw it away.""

Of course at this point my entire family is interested and wanting to see it. There was still a little bit of product in it but I kept saying it was medicine and then threw it away. Then of course another one was found on the floor, I hurriedly grabbed it and set it in the trash on top of a plate. Hoping I could go back later and grab it discreetly.

Of course at his point my parents are side eyeing me because they've found caps before. No one will drop the subject wondering how in the world the dog got medicine. I go back to where he was and THANK JJ there was my grandma's empty medicine bottle on the floor. So my family agreed that is 100% where he got the caps.  I go back once more and do another look so no one else will and find one more untouched cap, and pretend to throw it away.

We leave and look at the cap I saved and it was 100% what we had picked up earlier. I don't think the dog ate any, and even if he did it wouldn't touch him. 

I try SO hard to be careful. This time it was my SO who had them in his pocket. Our dude must have gave us extra cause he said he had all of the ones counted from earlier still on him. ",1511057543.0

Is this normal?,"I submitted a post a week or so back i believe stating i was starting opiate replacement therapy for the first time. I was initially put on 4mg but was quite sick from it and with my 2nd follow up was put on 2mg and for about a week or so i felt great. I had motivation, no cravings, my depression was improved, even my anxiety was lessened to the point where i was in utter shock. I am now no longer feeling good at 2mg. I get slight relief from my dose but it doesnt seem to be doing the trick anymore. Really any positives i just mentioned are slowly but surely slipping away. I see my Doctor early monday morning and im assuming that i am now ready to go up on the medication. Is it normal to go from feeling so great and stable to a drastic decline overall? I know there is a matter of finding the ""right dosage"" but im scared that this will be an on going thing and i truly do not want to exceed anything further than 6mg as i know less is more & the higher the dose the more difficult the journey off it is. On one other note side effect wise ive experience very low libido and inability to maintain an erection which is tough considering my age (im 23 years old), urinary rentention, dizziness, slight nausea & severe constipation.

So I came up with this idea, in the link above, I mentioned that ""opioid hunger"", that urge to redose/take a sniff is my biggest concern and long time ago shrooms helped me to break a habit (not correlated to any drug, not that serious - I mean not very big, like a lifestyle change, but big enough), then I thought maybe it will help me this time.

Another aspect is privacy. I don't want to go to my family doctor or anything like that. I am on a separate insurance plan from my parents now (have a new job! big part of wanting to quit) so not worried about that but would rather pay cash and avoid insurance depending on price...

Can someone tell me where to start, what it was like, etc? I know I could just end up on subs, but even that will be saving me a ton of money over H. I just want to be able to save money again.

7dxbmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7dxbmm/my_specialist_appointmentsecond_opinion/,8,https://redd.it/7dxbmm,dori_88,My Specialist Appointment/Second Opinion,"Heya Bropiates. After meeting with the 2nd opinion pain management appoint last week I flew over 400 miles a week later on short notice to be seen by the addiction specialist.

The specialist wanted me to start a Buprenorphine patch which I am 100% willing to do and want to do despite the potential for a seizure. 

I had a seizure once when I tried a 2mg/0.5mg suboxone film. They think the 0.5mg naloxone in the Buprenorphine and the high dose of Buprenorphine caused me to have a seizure along with the potential of other drugs in my system.

They think microgram dosing of the Buprenorphine in a patch would be perfect for me. At first I was nervous about doing this but after meeting with the addiction specialist she recommended a few things:

1. USE THE PATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CURRENT 30MG NARCOTIC DOSE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES EXCEPT ADDING THE LOW DOES PATCH.
2. DO IT ALL INPATIENT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL SEIZURE
3. EVENTUALLY WEEN OFF THE NARCOTIC AND JUST BE ON THE BUPRENORPHINE PATCH
4. GET OFF EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BUPRENORPHINE WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT 1.5-2.5 YEARS FROM NOW. 

I do eventually want to be off the drugs, but it's hard you know.

I was so surprised she recommended to keep me on the narcotic, 30mgs of oxycodone. She said if I do it that way I'll most likely eliminate problems with breaking through the suboxone on my receptors for the pain problems. 

Then when I have pain flares if I could use an at home script I'd be able to stay out of the hospital and have 24/7 pain relief instead of this yo-yo*ing* effect and nightly withdrawals I've been dealing with. 

The specialist seemed to think staying on the microgram dosing wouldn't block the opiate the way it does in 2mg+ doses. It'd be like a 20mcg dose so it'd be easier/simplier to breakthrough the pain 

She alaso said later on down the line once I get stability I could switch to just the patch alone and then from there potentially come off of the patch entirely.

***I'm really happy about this.***

Unfortunately, my parents aren't on board and accused me of lying to the doctor about things, when I was brutally honest. I don't think I've ever been this honest with doctors before and this was her professional opinion. 

I'm upset with my family they keep calling me a street junkie and belittle me over my use of drugs in the first place and they say a lot of deeming things, but it's rough because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm  just trying to do the right thing for my pain and it just seems like my parents are unsupportive and it's really upsetting me quite a bit.

Support would be warmly welcomed! Here's to hoping things go well and I do better now.",1511054526.0

I'm doing fine with it, even though it's pretty hard to feel emotions and physical ailments unfiltered. I've been branching out in terms of everything, social life, music, books etc. which keeps me busy and offers at least a modicum of excitement.


I don't feel cravings towards heroin at all. That is surprising to me, since I had been shooting up daily for two years without major interruptions. Cocaine is a much bigger issue though. I crave a bellringer so badly. In a perverse way I feel a strange tingling of nostalgia when reminiscing on my coke days. Just sitting on my bed for hours, fixing a shot, yakking, heart beating out of my chest, sweating bullets. My entire life was condensed into one thought: how do I obtain more coke so I can rush hard again? It's completely fucked, but I would kill to smoke some rock/shoot some soft, regardless of the damage it did.


And it did inflict a great deal of damage upon me, my entire life spiralled away during the Speedball Summer of 2016. My veins are shot, my finances are fucked and my dopamine household is out of whack. I often feel like neither Heroin nor Crystal are the big bad ones in terms of drugs. IV cocaine/crack is so much more destructive.


So anyway, just needed to vent. I can't really do that on the cocaine subreddit, since they look down on any ROA that isn't snorting. That's retarded to me, snorting coke is like buying a 5000 dollar, water-cooled gaming machine to play solitaire.",1511048042.0

 I have been on methadone for years and at my clinic they have posts up all over the place about getting your free Narcan kit. I have lurked in this subreddit for forever and have seen just way to many post and comments about how you people wish you could afford or get your hands on Narcan and I know that there are a few people on here that are amazing and send packs of all sorts to ppl in need and for free and I think that's just amazing. Ok on to my question do you think or does anyone know if I can ask for Narcan multiple times. I don't use anymore so really the ppl that work in the clinic would wonder why I want more then one kit even if I spread out the times of when I ask for the next kit. I live in a city that has almost zero heroin use and it's mostly pills and I haven't heard to much about the pills here being laced with fent but also because of that I feel like asking for a few kits and sending them to those who really need it isn't a big deal here. I obviously don't want to tell the clinic my real reason but if I can get my hands of even just a few and mail them out it's better then none. Just wondering if anyone in Canada has asked for multiple kits and what did they say? I want to help if I can and I thought that might be a start. In Ontario kits are paid for. At least where I am it's free. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I just want to help if I can. It should be free to everyone!

When I was 18 I began having several period pain. I ended up in Emergency Room and they sent me home with a script for a pain reliever they called ‚ÄúSeverdol‚Äù 100 little blue tablets. At first these made me vomit and itch but I stuck at it and I began to enjoy them. After a week I would take them after school just to take a good nap. I told them the pills made me nauseous so they also prescribed cyclazine , which I found when I combined them with the Severdol I had an even better time.  

I eventually decided to go to the GP and ask for a repeat of these , as I was running out. The doctor laughed in my face and told me that those are morphine pills and no I could not have them. I had no idea I had been taking morphine , I had been driving on them and everything. 

I started to really stress out when the pills dried up and ended up going to ED again , I would usually get a few shots of morphine and sent home with another script. 

I finally got my life together at age 20 and was clean for 5 years , until last year I broke my leg. The GP gave me 100 30mg Codiene with 3 repeats. I didn‚Äôt think they would do anything for me but if I take them with the cyclazine they are pretty nice. It‚Äôs now almost 2 years later , the doctor renews the script for 100 30mg codiene every 3 months and gives me another 3 month supply , he thinks I take it for period pain but I honestly take it because I have to at this point. I don‚Äôt take more than the recommended dose 60mg up to 3 times daily but as soon as I don‚Äôt have it I feel so much pain. I think this is going to be harder to kick than the morphine was.

One of the best feelings I‚Äôve ever felt (even over heroin) was when during my early days of getting clean that I realized ‚Äúholy shit I haven‚Äôt thought about heroin in days‚Äù.

It used to be wake up -> think of heroin, get heroin -> then think of how ill get more heroin once I come down, repeat.

It‚Äôs such a fucking relief to no longer feel that cycle or daily thoughts anymore.

Another one of the most important things ever said to me was when I went to visit my good friend after not seeing him for months that his mother said that ‚ÄúI look like I‚Äôm doing much better.‚Äù That really fucking stuck with me because I never felt my use would be that noticeable to where someone would ever say that.

figured I'd post this & see where it went. I don't know anyone else who messes with ops so I'm talking here.

for a about a year I've been pretty heavy into drugs. I've always been interested in them & smoked weed quite a bit since I was 17. I lost my mother when I was 17 in a car crash & just turned 22 on the 4th. 
around this time last year my great grandmother passed whom I was very close to and it hit me hard. I think the next week I randomly hit up a dude I knew and asked if he had any H. 
I had done more than my fair share of pills & (stupidly) was sure I wouldn't get addicted. after a few weeks of just buying points & loons, I was hooked. I did it every chance I got. sold some cool shit I regret blah blah blah you guys know how it goes.
i had tried coke a few times before & one night I wanted to get some after my first payday at my job I started as some sort of twisted celebration I guess?? long story short, I got arrested that night for possession of coke (1g).
I started my 3 year probation in February this year. I have quit doing H since all that happened last year but I'll still hit it if it's around for whatever reason I don't know.
in the past month I've got my first job I have ever actually been proud of. my first job learning a trade. however in the past month I've also been buying coke. like a gram every 3-4 days. (I definitely stretch it out.) it helps me at work & makes me more confident which is something I've always had a lot of trouble with.
I've never been one to admit I need to go to a therapist or whatever but I'm confused & was curious about a couple things. 

-I've never been a fan of uppers but I've grown very fond of the one mentioned above.

-I feel like I subconsciously switched dependency? I was happy to finally not be dependent on opiates.

-I am supposed to be taking drug tests for my probation. why can't I shake this hopeless feeling & make myself care more? I find myself pushing meetings back.

-why can't I be happy with the good life that I have? I've been asking this for too long. /:

7e7k5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e7k5s/questions_on_oxynaxolone_pills/,5,https://redd.it/7e7k5s,OstoFool,Questions on oxy/naxolone pills,"I'm from Australia and doctors are generally just prescribing Targin now. Brand names might differ from country to country, but they are extended release oxy/naloxone blends at a ratio of 2:1.

What we know: naloxone is added to prevent abuse and help relieve constipation. It does help with the latter, but you absolutely cannot take Targin with any other ROA other than oral to minimize the naloxone exposure. You can crush the pills up and parachute them for IR, however the maximum prescribed dose of 40/20 has been successful in limiting abuse. I'm prescribed 15/7.5 pills, and I can catch a quick high with potentiators (DXM and GF Juice) if I bomb 3 at once. 45/22.5 is the maximum dose I can take before the nax starts to pull the oxy away in noticeable amounts. Even though oral bioavailability is less than 2%.

What I can't figure out is the naloxone half life. Apparently it's only 30-80minutes, regardless of ROA, so hypothetically, I should be able to stack oxy doses two hours apart and get higher. I've even stretched this to 2.5 hours, but I swear additional pills only seem to sober me up due to naloxone concentration, when the original dose should have metabolized out of my system by that point.

These abuse-proof pills are getting rolled out in other countries apparently, so surely it's something that other users have had to experiment with. It's going to affect all pill users eventually.

So, for those that have been using oxy/nax blends...

What is the max dose of oral oxy/nax you can do at one time before getting diminishing returns from the naxolone?

How long between doses can you get high from without naloxone concentrations building up and killing it?

This is unlikely, but has anyone found a way to filter out the naloxone from pills, or found an enzyme that can motabilize it faster?

I'm convinced that high oral naloxone concentrations increase the half life of the drug considerably, because I can take another 40/20 parachuted two hours after a previous dose and I feel straighter than had I not taken it at all. And according to all literature, the original dose of naloxone should have passed by that point.

I gave it four hours yesterday between bombs and still felt very dimished returns. I'm wondering if it's just me and I don't metabolize naloxone as fast as others do, but it's killing my high in a big way. I absolutely cannot stack oxy doses and basically can't get high anymore.

I swear I could get higher off one 30mg IR oxy than a 50mg oxy/25mg nax bomb that I'm doing these days. Tolerance aside. The naloxone is not only capping my ceiling dose of oxy, but I find it reduces the effectiveness by at least 30%.

This is gonna affect all of you soon. Apparently the oxycontin manufacturer is going to roll it out globally to try and hold a monopoly on the ER oxy market since the patent is expiring soon.

It would be great if a redditor with some experience in pharmacology could comment on how to remove or at least metabolize the naxolone quicker.

Or provide some insight into possible extended oral half life of naloxone in high concentrations, because the pharmacology on it that's well published doesn't make sense. The half life is extending well beyong the 80 minutes!

Someone tell.me they are in the same boat. Apparently Targin are flooding the dark net too, because that's all doctors are prescribing in many countries.",1511167897.0

Sketchy as fuck. My ""friend"", Cliff convinced me to spend my last $190. That the following day his friend would deliver 30 subs + give him $85 that would go right back into my pocket. I've asked four times and I still don't remmeber why the guy was supposed to pay us $85. If the story was true, perhaps he was lying about the price of a bun to the guy.... Oh yeah and part of the deal would be that we would buy two buns of H for the sub connect's brother. The sub connect doesn't use dope anymore but his brother does.

&nbsp;

First on Thursday night the goal post kept getting moved forward until I was on my way home with the understanding that the subs would be delivered by 7:30am. Cliff texted me at 7:30 stating the guy was not called into work and would come around later. 

Later that afternoon Cliff says ""the sub connect left his house at 2pm."" After that no he alleged that he got no more message responses.

Around 5pm that day Cliff text me that he made a mistake. Upon arriving at his house he explains that, the sub connect's brother came by his house at 7:30 am to pick up the two buns. That the sub connect stopped answering his phone after 2pm and now the phone is off. 


&nbsp;

Great so now I'm out $190, and have no way to get my anxiously awaited subs. Oh wait, Cliff found $20 in his other pants. So he gives that to me, I go to find his sister but she's out so I can't get subs through her at that time.

The following morning, he calls my cell and house phone. Explains that the dboy is willing to credit a bun if we give him the $20. I fucking snap, like damn it all to hell. Fucking have some damn patience or something and wait.. splitting a bun between two people gets them well for a night and a day but a sub can last much longer especially the way I cut them up. 

Well, I gaveh im back the $20 because I'm a junkie and wouldn't mind one last hurrah of getitng high.. plus wishful thinking, maybe he's not lying about his friend with 30 subs and maybe that guy will miraculously show up. 


&nbsp;

So I snort some fent powder (the dboy literally said it was fent) mixed with what seemed like salt and I was quite faded that night and well for up to 16 hours after my last does. Even after that I didn't feel ill effects until the cold air started getting me and eating dominos pizza didn't help. My ""friend"" didn't rob me of half a bun as I thought he might. I was expecting him to say ""dboy only delivered half a bun... here's two bags."" So if he was truthful and honest about splitting a bun with me, maybe he wasn't lying about my $190 going towards subs?


Fuck, I'm making my own head spin. I think it's likely I was scammed... That's why I already made a doctor's appointment on my next pay day. I need to separate myself from this shit, I'm too easy to manipulate and take advantage of. I'm sick and tired of going to work dope sick. 


As for the money, without insurance I'll still come out ahead going to a psyciatric professional.

&nbsp;


**Long story short:**
tl;dr:

I managed to borrow $20 from another friend, bought two subs and provided some services the person who walked to the sub connect and who successfully procured subs. I thanked my ""friend's"" sister profusely and helped her patch a hole in her air mattress, and ran a long CAT5e cable so that her computer would no longer be plagued by wifi issues when streaming TV. 

When I indicated I was gonna give half a sub to her brother she detested the idea. ""Those are for you.."" she said in addition to platitudes about her brother being a lazy con artist which are somewhat true but who am I to judge?

I told my friend Cliff that I'd try to get the subs in the morning before work.. moved the goal post forward a bit as he often does to me.

**Question:**

Do I give Cliff half a sub tomorrow or say fuck him? I can technically part with half a sub based on my taper plan, but it never hurts to have extra. 

Sometimes he has helped me stay well but other times he has lied to me and left me in a vulnerable position such as going to work outright dopesick after counting on a lie from him.

So i've been chipping for >2 years now starting with hyrdos >> oxys >> U47700 >> Dope and as of the last year my tolerance has gone to shit and/or my body just sucks at metabolizing opi's << morphine. It seems ever since I reached the 80-100 mg oxy for a good nod my tolerance has peaked, I still get mildly high / somewhat disassociated but it lacks the warmth / euphoria. Last shii'te I got did almost nothing but I have a suspicion it was #3 dope as it was more of a brown then tan / off white and I don't shoot, only ever snorted / boofed. What gets me is taking a tolerance break should reduce your overall tolerance over time, but I can go 1-2 months with no dope whatsoever but my tolerance never seems to back down? I do my best to practice safety / harm reduction but even redosing after 20-30 min just seems to extend the weak effects i'm getting. Of course the first few times we're heaven and ya im chasing the dragon but with breaks like this you'd figure i'd get some kind of tolerance reset, yet it seems like nothing... I've never main lined (not even medically) and would like to avoid for as long as possible. I've tried tagament as a potentiator and have access to hydroxizine which I believe works as well.

I'd like to get  views and personal stories of current or former opioid users, while protecting your identity in off-the-record interviews, about mediocre or fragrantly terrible or fraudulent treatment you've received in the past or currently. I'm also interested in understanding why there is increasing counterfeit fentanyl use and your views about why dealers are selling product that kills their customers? Also, I'm interested in understanding any illegal or improper use of Suboxone or other medication-assisted drugs while you continue to abuse opioids. Is it because Suboxone and related medications are so hard to obtain, expensive and so few doctors offer it? Is it commonly used or abused as a street drug?

 You can contact me via personal message here and let me know if you're open to being interviewed off the record,and the best way to reach you. If anyone wants to go on the record, that's appreciated, but not necessary. I'd prefer a phone interview, but live chat is acceptable, but hardly preferred. Most people on reddit currenly don't have access to its brand-new chat function. 

I  had a cover story recently in Newsweek about VA fueling the nation's opioid crisis and killing thousands of veterans through accidental overdoses, then a draconian turn-around that's needlessly cutting off chronic pain patients of opioids, increasing suicides. That cover story and related articles can be found here:

Until one night I'm with him in his car and I forgot my prescription bottle of 38 Xanax bars inside it. I proceed to blow up his phone to no avail. At this point I'm fucking livid and ready to curbstomp this fucker. So I go home and sleep it off and wake up still ready to kick ass but I have nowhere to find him, even went to his house but there were no cars there.

Anyway, a good friend of mine from back in the day calls me today saying he hit a lick on S. Apparently my boy was buying some dab rigs from S but when S gets in the car he gets a Glock with a 50 round drum in his face and gets told to run his pockets. So he takes everything from him from his phone to his car and leaves him in Sacramento without any shoes on and tells him to walk home. As I'm hearing this I busted up laughing because I knew karma would get him back.

Everything is perfect!,"For a long time, my routine used to be one half gram shot shortly after I woke up, and that was my dope for the whole day until I went to sleep, woke up, rinsed and repeated. 
Lately, though, I‚Äôve been doing very small shots (half a .1 to one .1) throughout the whole day so I can satisfy my needle fetish and collect more cottons. 
If you go through my post history and look at my most recent post before this one, you‚Äôll see I had a shitty night tonight, on top of all the shitty bullshit-ass fucked up problems going on in my life lately. So tonight I said ‚ÄúFuck it!‚Äù and loaded up about .6 to .7 in a single shot. I registered and blasted off. 
I haven‚Äôt gotten a rush or even gotten high off dope in probably a month or so because of my tolerance and the fact I don‚Äôt let myself buy more than a $20 half g each day, and that‚Äôs not enough to feel it even if I do the whole half g in one shot. 

And HOLY GODDAMN FUCKING SHIT, man...! That rush!!! 
I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to hit me so strong, but as soon as that rush hit me, it was so strong that I had trouble seeing straight and focusing my eyes. Goddamn have I missed a true, full-strength heroin high. This is why I fell in love with Mistress Heroin. 
I feel like I‚Äôm on top of the world, invincible, like everything is perfect. Now I‚Äôm just riding that beautiful, beautiful high and smoking a cigarette on my back porch with my husband. I‚Äôm not particularly physically affectionate, but I feel so fantastic that I asked him for a big bear hug and a bunch of kisses. (Which made my husband very happy. üòçüòçüòç) 

On a final note, I hope my whole r/opiates family is doing as great as I am tonight!
 Everyone who‚Äôs using, I hope your high is as amazing as mine. Remember to stay safe. You can always do more but you can never do less. Keep Narca around and make sure you‚Äôre with someone who knows how to administer it. 
Everyone who‚Äôs sober, or trying to stay sober, you can do it! Just take it one day at a time, sometimes even just minute to minute. Stay strong! 
And to everyone, stay safe and have a great night!!! Love you all! I feel like I belong here and (for the most part) everyone here is so accepting and positive and helpful. It really feels like a family here, albeit a fucked up, disfunctional, addict-ridden family. I love each and every member here and am glad to share a space with you all. Anyone who ever wants/needs to talk, about anything at all, is more than welcome to PM me anytime and I‚Äôll listen and give advice with absolutely no judgement. I promise.

Three days ago my mother accused me of being ""stoned"" or snorting coke, when I was not even high. I had been around her high the day before, and she didn't say a word. She lashed out and attacked me, so I decided that there was no way I could go home. I called my grandmother, and she said I could stay with her. Well, when my mom found out I was with my grandmother, she lost her shit even more. She said that she would never talk to me, or my grandmother again. She said that I betrayed her. My father then proceeded to call my grandmother and bitch her out for taking me in. So now I have created some huge ass problem within my family. Holy shit. How could my father bring my grandmother into the problem like that? I feel terrible. Next, the only friend I had pulled some bullshit on me. We have been friends for years now, and he has suddenly declared that he's madly in love with me. He knows all of the bullshit I've been going through, and yet he decided to throw that on me. I feel yucky about it. The past week or so he made me feel like I owed him something, or like I was his property. He seems really delusional, and thinks that I'm secretly in love with him. I have to cut the friendship off now, because it's just sick and unhealthy. He is incapable of being someone I can chill with or talk to. When I say I'm alone, I really mean it. How am I supposed to stop when I have absolutely no support? I'm going to the clinic on Tuesday, but I just don't know. I feel lost and alone. How can I stop when there doesn't seem to be anything to live for anymore?",1511138714.0

I was cleaning trucker cum off of showers when suddenly this ragged older hippy lady confronts me as guests (we're trained to call them that. how lame.) often do. She was asking me if I knew anything about the credit card machine for the washing machines, a situation which arises more often than I'd like. I don't have time to deal with this shit.

 Well, this time I did for some reason. 
I call my manager back there to speak with her through the radio, and go about my business. As I'm folding piss, mucus, shit, vile fluid-stained towels, I overhear her talking about some top secret scheme the government has going against us. I keep at it, cleaning showers as usual. I've made up my own routine by now. The shortcut way, the efficient way, and probably not the most sanitary way is what I've adapted to using since time is always of the essence. If there are two guests waiting, I'm fucked otherwise. 
Well, she was once of the previous guests apparently. She stopped me again to tell me what a nice job I had done on cleaning the showers. They were ""beautiful"". 

Of course she saw everything that way. This woman was either on heavy amounts of drugs or just straight batshit insane. She went off on rants about ""the man"" basically, trying to shut us down with this shit jobs and prescription drugs, etc. (which I partially agree with, but that's a different matter). She went on to say how she was traveling with her friend who was a ""sensitive"". I asked what that is and she said he's someone who can actually sense events before they happen and such things. Apparently, they were traveling in a van together and stopped by my store because ""you guys always have clean showers"". She went on and on rambling about some wild shit about vibrations and feelings and sounds and various topics. Conspiracies mostly. Then she ended by telling me I'm a gem and capable of much more than cleaning showers. 

For a moment there I pondered over her statements to me, wondered if it was a sign, and thought seriously about getting my life together. Then I probably went home and took more xanax, bupe, and vaped dank. Such is (this) life. I'm so over and done with trying to bring an early end to myself. I have someone in my life who makes it worth living now. So, with her help I'm tapering one drug at a time until I'm off it all. Except some medical weed. If I have to jump in a van with hippies and live life on the road, then I will. Until next time, peace out opiate family.

A little background:

I am a victim of domestic violence, and for years now my partner has been pilfering my strips for his own abuse problems. Seeing as he pays for my treatment, every time I confront him about it, he threatens me with not paying anymore. I live in a rural area and there is only one seedy cash clinic nearby. Despite having 90/10 insurance, they won't even hear of taking it. 

I can usually work around this and mete out my doses out for the month but things just got out of hand with my partner's need to get high, and my refill isn't for another 10 days. My bottle is empty.

My usual dose is one 8/2mg strip 2x per day. Now, to my question: If I take a hefty dose of maeng da kratom, will that stop some of the withdrawal effects? I am calling my doctor tomorrow first thing, but for now this is my only option. 

I took the kratom on an empty stomach, along with 1 mg xanax (prescribed for panic disorder). According to the kratom bag, I took 6 grams. 

Thank you all for any help you can provide. I am actually going to escape this relationship within the week, and have received overwhelming support from my family.",1511129869.0

7e3nce,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e3nce/for_those_heavily_addicted_i_now_somewhat/,6,https://redd.it/7e3nce,Mr_J111,"For those heavily addicted, I now (somewhat) understand and fear I may end up going down that road.","For starters, I am dependent on Kratom (20g a day) for depression and knee pain. It does serve it's purpose for depression and body pain. Since it does have a binding affinity to the mu opioid receptors, technically, I guess I am already a (lightweight) mild opiate addict.

I suffer from PTSD and chronic anxiety (my ""excuse""). I am heavily addicted to benzo's (was a very heavy drinker but found benzos to be the lesser of 2 evils). I know that I would be in severe trouble if I was suddenly out of benzos...Anyway, to my point about which drugs do what for me.

Benzo's - My mind tends to race 1000 miles an hour. I over analyze every situation and expect the worst outcome. Wherever I go,  my mind is constantly scanning for potential danger and creating an exfil/ fight or flight plan if one of these scenario's do occur. Benzo's are not fun for me, they simply allow my mind to tell me ""woah, relax a bit bud, you don't have a bunch of people out to kill you"".


Psychedelics (particularly tryptamines) - Allow me to escape to another dimension and kindly explain to me what is wrong in my life. It will then tell me how I can go about fixing it and what it will accomplish.
 Purely educational for me and have been beneficial for giving me the courage to seek help and/or make the necessary changes in my life (which is still a massive work in progress).


Alcohol - I rarely ever drink now, but when I did, it was similar to benzos for me. Numb the pain and slow down life. I was never drunk, I drank steadily around the clock. Just enough to drown out the anxious feelings but enough to make me quite physically ill. I am convinced that had I not switched to benzo's, I would not have a liver. Sure I have had bouts of complete sobriety from everything for up to 4 months. It was honestly the worst 4 months of my life.


Stimulants - I am very fond of this class of drugs because they allow me to keep up with the pace of life and enjoy it (diagnosed adhd as well but suspect it is a co-morbid symptom of ptsd). I quite enjoy the often terrifying situations that come about and not only do I get a huge dopamine rush, but I also get shit done.


Weed - Allows me to relax a bit but I can't get anything done. I become creative and sex becomes much more enjoyable. I have only recently started smoking again (mostly indica) because it is a powerful tool that allows me to lower my benzo usage a great deal.


Opiates - I was always one to grab some percocets or oxy's when they were around. It was a nice way to spend the day kicking back and relaxing. It was very occasional and I never became addicted (unless Kratom counts).


Now the part that scares me.... About a week ago, I got some strong prescription opiates (I do not want to post exactly what atm) but it was enough for a weekend of nodding.


WOW! I was nodding for the first time and it was heavenly. For the first time in many years, I felt at peace, no worries about anything.
Sure, benzos help me slow down to a walking pace, but this.....This feeling allowed me to completely stop running or even walking. Instead I was able to just lay in the grass and relax without a care in the world.


I hit one state where everything seemed to be made of gold and my mattress was like lying on a heavenly cloud. I thought to myself ""this is it, this is the nod everyone talks about, it's quite possibly the most beautiful thing I've felt"". 


I continued dosing through Saturday and Sunday all day, it was absolute paradise. I did not have to worry about eating, work or doing anything. I even brought a big empty jug next to my bed to piss in because getting out of bed was work that was interfering with my nod.


That feeling; once it hit while smoking a cigarette and I could barely keep my head up: I can only describe as the brightest golden ray of sunshine warmly embracing me. Then, I knew it was time to go back to my cloud (bed) and not give a fuck about anything - Just enjoy the heavenly warmth of everything...Everything that is safe, beautiful and sacred around me. Music took on a whole new direction for me and was indescribably serine. I am now hooked on ""The Revivalists - Wish I knew ya"" because it was the most beautiful hymn to come from the heavens while in my golden state. Listening to it almost brings me back there.


As an addict, I already know how my addict brain works. It will do everything in it's power to have that feeling again and if I am not careful, I will be chasing the dragon everyday severely addicted to another substance. I know where that road leads and to become addicted to another substance will surely result in my demise.


After a week, my brain is somewhat trying to reason with me. It is telling me to go after that feeling again. It's the kind of feeling I want to have every 2 months when I have a weekend to do nothing. Sounds reasonable enough to me if I were to only use for a couple of days every 2 months right? Well...I guess I just fear my addict brain will take over. Those 2 days every 2 months will become 3 days every month eventually leading to every weekend and before I know it, the claws of addiction will once again have full control over me.


I can honestly say that I am not craving that feeling (well, maybe a bit) and can wait a few months to try again. Perhaps it's my addict brain trying to trick me. I guess I am not asking any questions, I am just posting my feelings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but hell. I can't wait for another couple of months to go by so I can have that feeling again.

TL;DR - I'm a poly substance addict (mostly benzo's and stims) and a recovering alcoholic with PTSD. I had my first taste of strong opiates and it was a better feeling than any drug I have EVER tried. Better than high quality coke, methamp, MDMA, ketamine, DMT, xanax, sex: It did not matter, nothing came close to that golden paradise of nodding.

I have a big sack (250g) of Red Bali Kratom from Gaia Ethnobotanical. I also have a tiny bit of Gold MD but that's literally a gram worth. Can I mix the Gold MD with Red Bali?

&nbsp;

I'm fifteen hours from my last dose of dope. I feel surprisingly fine right now but expect to feel worse between tonight and tomorrow. I'm really surprised that I'm not being assailed by the cold chills but I expect that to occur eventually.

&nbsp;

**Should I wait until I start feeling stronger ill effects of opiate withdrawal before I start consuming Kratom?** I'm thinking of eating two grams straight at a time and no more than four or five grams in one sitting. I really hate the taste but I'm willing to get it down if it'll prevent me from feeling like total hell.

&nbsp;

Personally I'm more comfortable with 1-2mg doses of Suboxone but I'm willing to give Kratom another chance. I remember it worked one time for me before a work day. Another time I was using Kratom over the course of two days when I started getting intense stomach pains. It was suggested that I make tea out of it. The time I got the stomach pains, I was consuming Kratom inside of vegetable  gelatin capsules so I guess eating ten capsules in one sitting wasn't the best idea.

At first I expected just to see everyone talking about all their drugs, or what they were gonna take next (do see this some but no as much as I thought) but I saw kind of the opposite. 

You guys actually encourage each other to quit, and when someone posts here that theyre X days clean, you guys congratulate them and tell them to keep going. I'm not sure why I expected to see comments such as ""nah come back man. Heroin awaits!"" Or some shit like that, but I haven't seen that once.

She brought her shit over and was prepping a shot for herself while we were talking and started pushing me to have some. I wasn't in my right mind because my boyfriend had been choking me the night before and I was trying to figure out what to do, but I did have experience with opiates. I used to take at least 25 Tylenol with codeine a night, and I figured if anything shooting one hydromorph would be safer than all the shit in the pills. So I let her talk me into it. I didn't like it much, didn't feel much either so really all it did was make me more curious. So I kept doing it.

I knew if I did keep it I'd be doing it on my own, but my mind was made up. I'd decided I'd do it and I'd make it work because I already loved that little bean inside me more than I thought possible and it had only been a couple weeks.

Fast forward a few weeks and I just don't feel right, seems like my pregnancy symptoms have almost gone away and I'm getting worried. So I spend that day in the ER. They told me they couldn't come to a conclusion because I was only about 8 weeks but they couldn't find a heartbeat (although they said that could be positioning of the baby) but my HCG had also dropped by 8000 since the week before. I was told to return in a few days. I got home and six hours later I was stuck in the bathroom because I was bleeding so damn much, passing clots the size of my hand. I knew then for sure that I'd lost the baby. It was hard but I handled it alright, until 4 days later when I pulled my pants down to pee and there was a recognizable fetus sitting on the pad I was wearing. I just about lost it. In some ways it was good because I had my minute with the baby, in other ways it was really bad. Despite passing the fetus I continued bleeding for three weeks. All during this time I started using daily. At first for the pain, then to forget. 

Then at the three week mark I start having those big rushes of blood like I did that day I got home from the hospital with the big clots and everything except it was happening like every 15-20 minutes. I looked like a ghost. I couldn't even stand up anymore. There was something really wrong. So I was rushed to the hospital, they didn't even do an ultrasound they just looked at my blood work said I wouldn't make it through the night if they didn't do something and did an emergency d&c. This was kinda traumatic for me, and I got so angry at my body. The two things it's made to do are carry a child, and when it can't then get rid of all the products of conception. That's what my body is built for, but it couldn't do either of those things properly. I felt like less of a woman. I was so disappointed in myself, so angry at everything else too. 

I'd picked up heroin once before I went into the ER, a few days before and not much and I knew I'd get back on track, and I started to. But after being in the hospital and having the D&C I feel like I'm back to square one and have to come to terms with losing my baby all over again. All I've done since I've been home is use. I've picked up heroin multiple times, done more hydromorph than I can count. Today I even missed my methadone so I'd have an excuse to use more. So I went and spent $100 on heroin, and also picked up a hydro 12, and 4 8mg hydros. I know it'll all be gone by like maybe 2am at the latest but probably much earlier. I'm just really disappointed in myself. I'd come so far. But at the same time, I want to allow myself to grieve however I need to.

One fell through, the other I did 1 day and he hasn't called back (not sure why, I thought it went pretty well...) and another wants me to start tomorrow.  
The money is pretty good - usually around ¬£10/hr, you get a combination of cash on the night and weekly pay, and really it's just spending a few hours driving round listening to podcasts.

Then I used way less but after a while I felt like I was going nowhere and aimed for total sobriety. I thought I was going to get more support and the lack thereof in any kind of progress made me want to use more. So now I‚Äôm pretty much back to the basics: shitload of benzodiazepines, dope and a lil coke here and there.

So my question is: do you think we have to embrace our addiction fully in order to hope reaching sobriety?(basically getting rid of any guilt about using is what I mean)

It might seem counterintuitive but as I‚Äôve never wanted so much to be sober I‚Äôm fucked up all the time and when i let go I seem to use way less...
