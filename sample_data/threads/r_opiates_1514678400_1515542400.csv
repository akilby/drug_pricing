Got clean over 30 days then started chipping for a couple more months.  As we all know how that goes it started getting out of hand where I was using more days than not.

Anyways I am clean again now for 25 days today.  Long story short I've found 15 oxy 10/325s.  40-50mg used to hit the spot when I was using daily.  So I'm sure 20-30mg would work now.

Question is what kind of price am I going to pay for this WD-wise.  Let's say I use 20-30mg twice a day for 2.5 days.  Are my withdrawals back at square 1?  Bad hangover for a couple days?

Sidenote:  Believe me I know the dangers of relapse but all my sources are gone at this point.  This just happened to be a lucky find (that's why they're free).  So this will really be a one time deal.",1514730550.0

- Started using Oxy about 2.5 years ago. 20mg would have me in heaven.
- Would go weeks or months between uses at first. 
- Over time this progressed to 4-5 day binges once a month, every month. The reason I didn't use more is because I'm out of the UK a lot and have no access then.
- 20mg doesn't do anything for me now, even with weeks off. 40mg is what I need to feel good but there are many days I've taken 120mg in a day. 
- I don't know if I've ever been physically addicted. I've felt absolutely terrible at the end of binges but not sure if that's just from binging on oxy and coke. That said, a couple of days after binges I've felt terrible, then taken an Oxy and magically felt completely better. so it seems likely I was in withdrawal. 
- I think about Oxy every day, for multiple hours every day. I'm about 70 days clean at the moment. My thoughts are still, 'Maybe if I just go back to using once a month I can get the lovely effects without the downsides'.
- Work couldn't be going better, have a good marriage and am in great physical shape. 
- I visit this sub every day. Almost salivate when I see some of the pill porn.

I should never use opiates again, right?",1514721199.0

been getting a bunch of bullshit lately. it sucks. i got beat for 80 fuckin dollars tonight while i was sick, ended up with a dub of very low quality tar. some sad shit. i'm not really doing anything special tomorrow night but i wanna have a nice time w my girl and that's not gonna be so easy if i'm as sick as i was earlier today. i managed to save about 4 puffs of this garbage for the morning, but that won't hold me for long. i should be able to get ripped off and end up with a miniscule amount of dope that can sort of keep me off sick for a few hours tomorrow. i really don't see myself not getting fucked in the ass by the universe like usual tho. 

so, i'd like to try to get a little bit high tomorrow night. i have a few T3's laying around. think that's my best chance at getting a little buzz on tbh. so, 330mg codeine phosphate, approx. equivalent to 45mg morphine (possibly as much as 75mg actually tho? i'm seeing diff info). i have ~100mg dxm, bunch of dph, and two boxes of lope. i've never used dxm for potentiation. is it actually worth bothering? i'll prob skip the dph, makes me too drowsy. i do also have a few grams of some red vein kratom as well. even if i get some dope, i'll need all the help i can get.

*****************************************************
so i guess my questions are...

any problems with kratom + codeine? i'm hoping the combo of the two super light highs might produce one mild high. god i'm desperate lmao.


i'm a heroin addict. am i gonna feel this shit at all? thing is, my tolerance really isn't that high rn. the tar i've been getting is such low quality, i might make a G last me 2 days or more, but there's no way there's more than like 50mg of any actual dope in there. i swear. so if i've been dosing like 10mg diamorphine at a time and getting some relief, maybe even a little buzz, maybe 330mg codeine will get me somewhere.

is there any place for the lope here? will the effects ""stack"", will it block the effects, will it do nothing at all? 

boofing codeine is a dumb idea, right? i've never boofed anything but i'd totally start now if it was worth it. 

thanks for reading lmao, hopefully i can actually get a slight buzz going tomorrow night, we'll see.",1514715976.0

7n7ezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7n7ezi/my_story/,33,https://redd.it/7n7ezi,nopulseoflife77,My story...,"It started when I was 18. I grew up with a very liberal but very anti drug family. The first hard drug I ever tried was ecstasy. It was amazing and I thought what else is everyone lying to me about. I felt like drugs were keys to doors to feelings and thoughts that you can’t experience any other way and I wanted to try and experience everything. Coke was the next thing I tried and I loved it. But my mom found out and put me into rehab. 

When I got out I went down to FL to live with my dad and immediately went looking for coke. I found it and then one day the guy I was getting it from said that he couldn’t get anymore blow that day but asked me would I like to try some oxys, they were cheaper and felt amazing, I was in love . That got me on opiates. Back then in FL they still had the pill mills so my guy set me up with a fake MRI and script history. I went to two mills and each one wrote me 250 oxy 30s. It got really bad when I would run out of my scripts before I could get more the next month. Then one day they passed a law that everyone had to check all the patients history’s and I was cut off. 

So I decided to leave and move in with my sister in Baltimore. That’s when I was introduced to heroin. If you have ever seen The Wire then you know what my life was like in Baltimore. That show is 100% accurate. This whole time I am not shooting up just sniffing my dope which I think saved me. That lasted 2 years and then my sister found out and kicked me out. 

I got lucky and got offered a job out west at a ski resort.  A friend let me crash on his couch and and detox. Then I moved out west. I couldn’t find  coke or heroin out there so I started using mushrooms, LSD and DMT. I wasn’t using psychedelics to expand my consciousness, I was using them to get fucked up as much as could. I took so many shrooms one night that I broke my ankle and didn’t even feel it till I got to the hospital over an hour away. The paramedics were in shock how calm I was. I then got a connect in CA and started moving blow back and forth making a good amount of money. I must have stepped on the wrong toes because I only made a few trips before I got robbed at gunpoint. 

I decided to cut my losses and moved to Key West where I started using lots of coke again. I only lived in the Keys for a few months before my mom offered me a job in her company as a sales rep in AL. I got completely clean. I started exercising and really started making the right choices.  I met the love of my life and prepared to ask her to marry me. With in a couple months my girl dumped me, my grandmother died and I was diagnosed with pancreatitis. 

It was just too much and so I started using heroin again and I quickly turned from snorting to shooting. Didn’t take long for my mom to find out and fire me. So that’s my story, I am going into rehab next week and hopefully I finally get my addiction under control. But for the first time In my life I don’t have any hope. I don’t know if I’ll make it and I don’t care if I do. Sorry to end on such a depressing note. I hope someone reads this and decides not to go down this awful path. ",1514707625.0

[(https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7n3xr2/everett_wa_needle_cleanup_behind_a_home_depot/drzew10/?context=10000)]

**I'm giving you all fair warning now, it's a bit of a wall of text, so if you don't like reading - turn around now.**

Sorry for the wall of text - you don't need to read any of this if you don't want. It was cathartic just to be able to type it all out.

I speak from experience and one of the big problems I've had is the fact that drug use (especially harder drugs like heroin or meth) is (or seems to be) looked down upon. People tell you ""Why don't you just quit?"" (can't count how many times I've heard that). You feel (or at least I do) so guilty about your choice to use drugs and you feel afraid to tell people because of what you think they might say or that they won't understand.

I will say, the one time I went to detox, I felt very welcomed and understood. None of the nurses seemed to be judging me, they all seemed to want the best for me (genuinely). A lot of the nurses I talked to had kids or loved ones who battled with or were still battling with addiction and it gave them an inside look at what it's like. I think that really helps, parents with kids who battle addiction I think is the closest you can get to experiencing withdrawal without actually going through it. I remember when I was trying to quit cold turkey one time at my Dad's house and he came into my room on day 2 and he was beside himself... he kept telling me he just wished he could take all the pain away from me and let him take the burden. I know he would if he could too... that's just my Dad. I love him to death.

So many times when I'm talking to people about addiction, specifically opiate (heroin) addiction, they bring up ""just quitting"". I've always wished so badly that I could give them a day of what I feel like on day 2 or 3 of intense withdrawal. I've never experienced anything like it, it's hell on earth. People can try and compare it to the flu x 10 or whatever, but unless you've FELT it.... it just isn't the same. I would take any flu over bad heroin withdrawal.

I will say, in detox the process was the most comfortable I've ever been when detoxing. I was able to eat and even sleep due to the meds they were giving me. I've been wanting to go back because I need to give it another try... lest I end up dead from complications from IV use, broke and homeless, or worse. I'm just nervous, I know this is a totally paranoid thought, but coming back to detox I'd feel like a failure in their eyes. Like they tried their best with me once and I fucked it up.  I know this is irrational because I knew guys in there that were on their 10th+ times.

I don't think it helps that I'm already social anxious to begin with, so when you couple that with heroin use... well, it's not pretty. I'm already super high strung and up in my head about a lot of things. I always have been. Anxiety and depression run in my mom's family and I'm sure I've got a bit of that.

Then, once detox is over, I feel great for a week or two while the drugs slowly come out of my system and then it's back to boredom, restless legs, inability to get any good sleep. Boredom mainly. I've been using for so long, it's all I find fun anymore. When I was a kid I used to play PC games religiously (it was an addiction of it's own, no doubt) but when I try to go back to them when I'm sober, the interest just isn't there.

I'm not sure what the answer is for me or others, but I hope someone finds some kind of miracle cure. Wishful thinking, I know. I'll keep thinking of ways to help and if I ever get clean, I want to make it a mission in life to help other addicts. I know the pain all too well and if I could help just one other addict get and stay clean, it would make me so immensely happy.  In order to do any of that, I need to get clean first myself, I know this.  I'm just not sure when or how it will happen.  I've only been to detox once and after that I went to a rehab, which I promptly left after 4 or 5 days.  It just didn't feel like it was for me.  I'm shy by nature and that environment doesn't benefit people who are shy or timid. 

I'm not a bad person, I'm really not... I've done things I'm not proud of, but I still try my best to make the world a better place - even while in the throes of addiction.  I do believe I still have a moral compass and it leads to me getting scammed, ripped off, betrayed by so called friends.  Even strangers I see that are struggling, maybe sick, I've broken them off pieces in the past expecting nothing in return... just because I know that feeling all too well.  Granted, this isn't something I do all the time and I have to have extra, but still.  How many other junkies can say the same?  I tend to believe 99.9% of addicts are only out for themselves but there are the rare few I've run into that surprise me.  For how long, I'm not sure.  But that's why I want to get clean - if I was clean and had my desire under control, I think I could help these people.  I'm sure they've had much worse lives than I have and if I can be a friend to them without the constant idea of heroin lingering in both of our brains, I think I could help.  Obviously, this is much further down the road, if ever.  Just wishful thinking on my part.

Try not to tear me apart too much - I know some of these ideas are a bit loony and I'll get shit about more than a few things.  I guess I just wanted to say exactly what's on my mind.",1514705760.0

Are you guys operating under the idea that less water = hit you harder? Unfortunately, when you push it in, it's diluted in liters of blood so that can't be true other than placebo (which can be strong to be fair.

Perhaps under the idea that the less in the rig, the less likely you are to miss some of the shot? Fair enough, but the reason I use as much water as possible for how many shots i want to do is so that even if I miss a little bit, it won't be much due to dilution as well as adding all that water makes it MUCH LESS LIKELY TO ABSCESS!!

Anyway, I just wanted to share my 0.02c regarding this issue in the name of Harm Reduction. Using more water to get to 80-100 units instead of 20-40 won't kill your buzz, but it'll make life a lot easier on your veins. Please share your thoughts.",1514693406.0

Ive done this once before without issue, im wondering other than the risk of infection from tap water and non sterile fitering, if the binders and fillers in the pill can still harm my lungs and heart etc? I know never to IV pills without micron filtering, but is subq safer?

I believe since it isnt directly into a vein, that the drug is absorbed and the filler powders get left behind. Is that right? And if so what happens to that material? Does it get broken down or absorbed? 

Im just not sure about what risk im taking


As a side note, tylenol 3 and 4 are the stupidest pills. I stopped shooting dilaudid as needed for pain and switched to eating 4 t3 pills instead, the buzz is ok, but the tylenol wreaked havoc on my gut, i seriously feel these pills hurt my health that id rather shoot dillies lol.

It seems that all the Fent mixer that was going around is gone. This is all in the wake of a dealer named Manny getting busted here. Apparently, Manny was number 1 or 2 in the Los Angeles supply chain. Candidly, it has flushed all of the Fent out of the market and I am enjoying that. For months I was concerned about getting mixer or “scramble “ by accident. Also, it’s been ages since I have seen dope this old school: straight diacetylmorphine.

Every time I come on here and see ECP I can only think, “looks like rocks of Fent scramble.” I’m fortunate to have old school dope and black coffee with pastries for the holidays.

Can I melt down or refine H, specifically Bth/black into a form that I can put in the oil vape pen and effectively smoke it? Is this possible, if so how would you do it? Thank you","The title pretty much says it all. I have a Thc/Cbd ""oil"" vape pen, the kind with a disposable cartridge and rechargeable battery. An actual pen not those big ass vapes people get at vape shops or anything like that. I can post photos if necessary.  I want to refine black/BTH and then mix it in a cartridge or put it in an empty cartridge and smoke it out of the pen. 

Is it possible for someone to do this? I'm guessing in order to do so you'd have to melt it down and/or refine it to some degree. Which is cool because that'd be removing some of the impurities out and create a more potent substance. To melt it down Would it be similar to prepping a shot before shooting up? (I don't use needles and never have so I'm not too familiar with this)

Has anyone tried this before?


Some other questions If this is possible:
-So once it's melted down/refined and ready to be put in the cartridge would I need to mix it with the Thc/Cbd oil for it to properly work and smoke correctly? Or can it be a empty cartridge?

-is there any reason this shouldn't be done? 

I feel like it could be a good idea if you're a smoker considering you're melting it down and refining it getting a lot of the impurities removed so It could be a more potent substance and more discreet to smoke. And if mixed with the Thc/Cbd oil could be a hell of a combination lol

Would it be wasting any product or ineffective to go this route? If so, why/how?

If anyone has done this, has experience doing this, or other knowledge related to the subject please let us know your thoughts, experiences, instructions, etc please.

I’ve tried a forum search on this topic but have not found anything relevant - sorry if this is asked often!

In a month I’ll be flying into Bogata and staying within the country for 28 days - likely taking a number of domestic flights over that time.

I’m sitting on a long term, prescribed dose of 4mg of oral bupe (subutex) p/d as part of a substitution therapy scheme. While this has declined from 16mg p/d and I am shooting for 0, you might understand why I am reluctant to rush a 4-0 taper prior to leaving! Especially when trying to stay emotionally stable holding down this job.

Does anybody else here have experience with travelling internationally - ideally into Columbia or other areas of South Central America - with a legal bupe prescription? Any advice on what is needed to cover myself of this - a doctors signature? A copy of the prescription? Etc - would be *greatly* appreciated!

It’s an oddly specific question to google, but if anyone knows of any info sites out there that cover the rules for different counties or something like that, that would also be awesome.

I have no one else to spill it to so figured id spill it here. A little over a week ago I had over 8 months of sobriety under my belt. Everything was great and being sober and away from the madness was amazing. I don't know why I slipped up there was no reason to do so, but I did and unfortunately addiction won me over once again. So I picked up a couple packs and a few more packs as the week went on I was still flying under the radar. As Friday came around I decided might as well get some coke and go all out since ive already lost all that I worked for the past 8 months. So between coke and h, I had and up and down weekend, no harm done. Christmas came around coke is gone but still doing h. I got my hands on some xans. Christmas night I was feeling great had some xans in me and was going to pick up some more h with an old ""friend"". while picking up the h the dealer had some crack so I said fuck it lets get that rolling as well. between the h, xans and crack I was on top of the world and bound to fall off. I made it home that night. and last thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital with my family around me in tears explaining to me that without my sister finding me at 4 in the morning gargling in my own vomit I wouldn't be alive.....Just like that 8 months clean and sober and within a week addiction almost took my life. Now sitting here typing this a few days later I'm still using just h. my family looks at me like I'm an alien and I cant just see the disgust in their eyes. I'm alone and feel worse than I ever have in my life. But I guess I can be thankful I'm still alive... Thanks for listening.

I have real chronic pain. I was in pain management. I left on my own .. just felt it was hurting more than helping me. My oxycodone dose worked it’s way up to about 360MG daily. I just felt sick all the time. I usually took 90mg 4x daily. I decided to go the sub route to get off and hoping that I would get some pain relief from the sub. To my surprise it actually has been working well. I am RX’d 16 mg daily. I have never taken more than 6mg at one time and never more than 12mg in a day. I took my last Oxy on 10/28/17 after being on opiates for 8 years. I am going to start cutting the sub down. I figure the quicker I can get off , the better. 

So now that you have the background ... I want that warm feeling .. that oxy heaven feeling. I know I am doing well and I know it’s dumb .. but if I break down how would it work. I want to be able to take some oxy in between some sub doses. Reduce it a little , take some oxy for 1/2 a day and go back to the sub. I do not want to risk any precipitated WD so there is that. I’m not gonna lie .. I have real pain .. but you and I know that’s not why I want the oxy. Any suggestions?

Sorry if it’s not the right place for it, but it’s Sunday again. Time for my 50mg of hydro ritual. Out in my trailer in 17 degree weather with only space heaters and blankets to keep me warm. And opiates. Gonna smoke 2 cigarettes at midnight to ring in the new year, should be right at the peak of the hydro by then. Gonna stop using cigs at all 2018. Of all the drugs to start using at 25, cigarettes are the most stupid. You start smoking young, not a quarter of the way through your life. Gonna focus on getting a new job this upcoming year. I hate where I’m at with my current one. I’m a cashier/server at a burger place. Really nice place, cool company that runs it and cool coworkers and it’s actually a really fun job that I like a lot, I just hate that I feel stuck in it. My social anxiety and mood swings (probably undiagnosed bipolar disorder, we’ll find out on Friday for sure) prohibit me from becoming a bartender let alone a manager which I would like to do. Problem is I hate all the guests. All of them. Always. Sometimes. Not as often as before, but often enough and unpredictably enough to keep me from moving up. Some days are great though and I love everyone who comes through the door but I’m gonna be 25 next month and I have a college degree that’s gonna be a year old come summer in something I don’t even want to do anymore. I live at home with my parents and hardly have any ‘real ’ bills (weird complaint I know) or responsibilities. I have almost no friends outside of work save one and she’s really the only person I hang out with outside of work but of course I’ve gone and fallen head over heals hopelessly, helplessly and haplessly in love with her.  She was the first person in forever who had gone out of her way to be my friend back in a time when I had no business having friends cause I was such an angry, pissed off jerk. She’s beautiful and sweet and lovely and good hearted and likes me and wants to spend time with me (baffles my mind that she does but lol) and is everything I want in a woman. I’ve known her for years; but she’s married. Happily. With a kid. And he’s good for her.  (despite the occasional difficulties she’ll tell me about). I can never have her. And fantasizing about calling her mine involves wishing something terrible to happen to him or their relationship which I would never want to see and so makes me a bad person for wanting her. Im stuck in a rut and I don’t know how to move on with my life. I love her. If I get a new job we won’t be able to bae as close as we are now. I feel stuck. That’s what’s driving me insane lately. I’ve been experimenting with drugs and shit, especially opiates and I’m running steroids all because I can’t cope with where I’m at right now. I don’t love myself at all and so I don’t see myself with a future or anything. The funny thing is that despite that, i steadfastly believe in god and that he is good, that he is love. That he is all powerful, infinite and eternal.  But I don’t know where he is in all this. I don’t know what his divine plan is for me. I have a loving family who care about me and pray for me. They do everything in their power to help me but I go nowhere and I feel like I’m failing them, disappointing them.  Tonight I just want to feel good and forget about all of that. I don’t know that 50mg is gonna do very much though. My tolerance has gone up some which sucks.

You know when you can't pee? Here are some tips to get flowing.,"Any time I've had trouble peeing there has been a psychological component, especially before I discovered opiates. Sometimes it's just being in the same bathroom as someone you are uncomfortable being around, having to pee without a door or someone outright talking to you while you try to pee.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I just have to think about happy things. That new graphics card you bought... fixate on it mentally. That girl you hooked up with last month that you stopped talking to on good terms but gave great head... evoke that thought. 

That time you took command of the fleet and subdued the empire? Yeah, that can work.

The time you went to the soup kitchen and felt really pious about your actions, sure you can use that too if you're a smug prick who's prick won't pee. To each his/her own.

&nbsp;


Aside from successful past sexual experiences, recent financial successes, recent acquisitions of material posessions and memorable ""good energy"" moments being recalled there are other tricks to get peeing. 

&nbsp;

Before we continue, just last week I was visiting my friend and his wife and for some reason they did not have the TV on for the entire evening. We just sat there and talked and worked on our respective tasks. 

When it came time to use the bathroom there was no background noise except for their conversation and I just couldn't pee. I tried three times but just wasn't happening. Surely the suboxone I consumed that morning was contributing. 

Finally after leaving, I went down the block and behind a bank or insurance broker's building and found a nice cold yet cozy corner to offload my fluidic waste. In that case it was evident that it was mostly psychological but it is possible the at the cold air helped the process along.

&nbsp;


Finally, another more recent time when I was visiting my friend and his wife with the TV off I did do something else to get the flow started. Didn't bother blocking my ears shut... simply put on a movie and skipped to a favorite scene. Shortly thereafter the flow started.

* Sc-Fi series scenes work

* Anime--- all the cool shit that happens in any given Gundamverse.

* Stand-up comedy

* Even scrolling through instagram (doesn't always work).

* Letting the phone generate background noise of any kind from videos or music.


&nbsp;


I've tried sitting with a low success rate. The aforementioned tricks have worked best for me and even when we blame our opioids we can still leverage the psychological element of the issue to get pissed off (pun intended).",1514754159.0

I'd tried heroin once or twice about a year ago and enjoyed it but only bought it a few times as I was trying to get better (still am). I'm on methadone now and I rarely use but when I do it's almost always heroin. Just for the past two months or so. I had been dealing with only one connect for a month and a half, but recently met another one that I'd much rather deal with (always on time, friendly, gives deals when I buy in bulk, etc). For the first two weeks she actually had the same, if not similar dope to my last connect. It was a very dark brown, almost purpley when you looked at it under the light. It wasnt cut at all, and it was so good. But this week, her dope has been a different color and I notice when I hear my spoon and mix the shot there are small black specks on it sometimes. Whatever that is, it gets filtered out. But with the old dope it always free up brown, usually so dark it was almost opaque in the needle and it was hard to see the blood come into it. Now with this new dope, it draws up almost clear even when the shot knocks me right on my ass. It has a brown tint but the product itself is a lot lighter, doesn't seem to be cut more by her after she gets it from her guy, I usually meet her at her house as she gets home from picking up and she takes it right out of her own and weighs it out, and it's more of a tan colour. Once it's in the rig it looks like a light kinda murky brown, sometimes I can hardly see the brown and it looks almost clear. Now my question is regarding fentanyl. I know for a fact that the stuff she was selling before this didn't have fent in it, but I'm starting to think that this does and that it may be a lot. I meant to take pictures but woke up and did my last shot without remembering to take it. But based of my poor description would you assume that it's fent? If so, would it just be laced or would it be more fent than dope at this point? I'm beginning to think that it's mostly fent just because I've never seen any dope draw up into this colour.

So what do you guys think? Your input is highly appreciated lmao",1514744553.0

Just have a question regarding the extended release version of Nucynta (Tapentadol). 

My father has chronic Lyme Disease and is on a TON of meds for it. For those of you that don't know, it's a crippling illness that makes everyday activities next to impossible due to pain, cognitive issues, and other symptoms. That's a little besides the point, but he's the reason I have access to Nucynta. He doesn't like them and is about to switch meds, but he has a ton left... so before he flushes them, I grabbed one 200mg Nucynta ER for myself to try.

Now I'm by no means a frequent opiate user, but have tried some different ones throughout the past couple of years. Besides already trying my dad's Tramadol and initial release Nucynta, I've also tried Vicodin when my friend offered me some (he had them for a bad back injury), and I think I tried Percocet maybe once. They made me feel pretty good. If I had to compare, I think I liked the Vicodin the most, but its effects didn't last long. I did however also really enjoy the effects of the immediate release version of Nucynta (think it was 100mg). 

So anyways, today I have the opportunity to take a 200mg Extended Release Nucynta, and after plenty of research of safety and interactions with my other medicine (I also take 100mg of Wellbutrin for my (thankfully) fleeting depression and 30mg/day of Propranolol for anxiety). There were a few interactions, but nothing I was concerned about. Does anybody have any experience with the extended release version of this Nucynta medication? Is it a similar high to the immediate release version? I know it lasts longer obviously, but just looking to see what effects I'd get from this. 

Looking forward to taking this and am curious to hear your opinions about it.

It's like once I got the first one (which was from a missed shot) my body is just prone to getting them all the time. So in the past couple of months I have had 2 from missed shots, and I've noticed something bizarre I'm wondering if anyone else has had this experience. K so of course I miss a shot and it's like sore and infected and building up for a week or two until it is 'ready'. Finally when it is I open it up and drain it (all new, sterile tools of course) and proceed to drain it every night for a couple days. On like the third day I see something black like clogging up the hole... I press and press but it is stuck it's backing things up so I end up having to grab with my other hand and pull. And out comes this black, gelatinous, substance almost like a worm, and of course the remaining infection just oozes out behind it. Once the wormy thing comes out the infection seems to come out really quickly and easily, and it seems to clear up and start to heal right after that. This has happened twice now. I'm pretty sure that the black stuff was the actual missed shot of BTH but I don't know, has this happened to anyone else? I know it's so nasty but I'm curious if anyone has seen the same weirdness come out their body.",1514904206.0

so im curious about prepping this little pill, how is it done? do i just dissolve it in water? how much? should i just try to use as little as possible so i can dissolve it all into enough water to fit into the syringe?

i read up on plugging and unerstand that so all good there. just not sure about the prep of the pill. its a maroon or purple looking bad boy with 30 on one side and m in a box on the other. 

i am also curious how it will feel for me. my usual dose of oxy is 30mgs and that feels very nice three times a day. sometimes i might double the dose and that has me very very noddy like its almost too much. sometimes makes me sick to my stomach. i would probably try to ween down for a day or two to get my oxy dose down and lowered so i could enjoy the morhphine better.

But I can't find any conclusive information on how long this effect actually lasts, or even which chemical(s) contribute to it (naringin, naringenin, furanocoumarin... research basically says it's something to do with them but not the mechanism or how long it lasts)

7nkbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7nkbpc/my_story/,5,https://redd.it/7nkbpc,pillsonpillsonpills,My Story,"Bored outta my mind, figured it couldn’t hurt to write something down. The following is my story with opiates. Fast forward to my senior year of high school, my best friend introduces me to roxy 30s, this is 6 years ago. I pop one, we chill at his place, didn’t feel nothing and thought it was the biggest waste of $25 and would of much rather a “dub” (this is when I was starting to get big into maryjane). My background is white upper middle class I would suggest and my friends family had a lot more money. I get my wisdom teeth out, I get a script of Perc 5s. Same day I got them out my mom gave me 3 of the perc 5s and a xanax. That was the first time I ever got high off percs and right away could tell why people got addicted and liked them. Thinking about it, my mom easily finished half the script. That was my first ever taste, I wouldn’t do oxy again until my third year in college. I had a party  for my high school graduation and that same best friend before asked if I wanted to get some roxys for my grad party And i said sure. Gave him the money, never saw him again. Was only ($50) but he just kinda threw away our 6 year friendship over some stupid petty shit. As you might be able to tell, he was in the deeper stages of addiction. Third year of college comes and one of my coworkers brings up roxy, talks about how he has a connect and he loves them. I threw college parties often and he was kinda nerdy so I would always invite him to them, he would always ask if I wanted to get roxy with him and I said yes. This is where my first ever trips to go to a dealer would begin. They’re $$30 a piece..fuckk but ok buying 2 cya later. This small but consistent dosage of 2 a week would just increase maybe to 4 a week. Idk how but I told my mom I had this roxy connect( I didn’t have him directly I had to hit up my coworker who always made me front him) I didn’t mind fronting him, I liked him, he helped me out, and he always paid back on time. This connect had roxy all the time, and I have no idea how but I never had to worry about fakes with him either. He was 24 white male. I started picking up more like 15, most were for my mom who at the time had “back pain” and back surgery so I felt like I was helping her out. And she loved me!! Of course she did right. My coworker one night gets arrested for possession of heroin. What I think he was doing was getting me to front him, he would get me pills and use his money on dope. Anyway, he gave me the connects number and the connect saw me enough to the point he was cool meeting me alone. I started slowly spending every dollar ever on them, and my mom too. My mom has a very upstanding career as well as my dad, but we were quickly spending a combined $1000 a pickup. When I started running out of money my mom would say you going to see him? “No I don’t have money for them, but if you get me 2 I’ll go” (I said 2 because this was kind of a hassle, the guy lived like 45mins-1hr away depending on traffic. My mom gave me 2 every time and that year I got the best grades I ever got. Going into ever night class every day of the week, snorted 60mg of roxy before every class and got As and Bs, first time ever in college(before I partied hard and smoked weed all the time and never went to class) but I somehow learned like a champ bc I was totally ok getting high at school and learning. Whatever it worked. I get a gf, and she’s so straight edge, never seen pot before yada yada does good in school nerd type girl. I really loved her, but kept my love for roxy a secret. Only my friends knew but all of us hanging out she started to hear stories of me snorting pills and crazy shit happening. One dAy she wanted to try some. She was TINY. 5 foot, maybe 90 pounds. I was hesitant on letting her try it  bc I was starting to learn the bad path it could lead you on. I let her know that these aren’t a joke and they’re dangerous, like probably all of us, she took on the challenge. Oh yes, the beautiful drug relationship requiem of a dream shit began. As any normal human she loved it. Started buying some with me, she would stay a lot lower in dosage tho, maybe 15mg for her when at this point I was idling around 45-60mg. The good thing about pills is that they’re so expensive it kinda limits you out. My dosage never really went beyond 60mg bc they were so expensive and couldn’t afford a more expensive habit. My gf, my mom, and I are buying pills people. I’m keeping this dealer dude in fucking business. Paying across the board $30 a pill...

One day, hm dude doesn’t answer me. Again no answer later on in the day, next thing you know, I am experiencing withdraw for the first time. Wow this is actually ass haha. Come to find out dude got arrested, and the guy who he was with narc’d on him. He gets out like in 7 days, hits me up immediately. I’m his money maker yanno. Boom, like clockwork we get this train rolling again. Maybe a few months go buy, life’s great, my mom, gf, and I are all high and happy, we’re both getting good grades, working making money...the good life. 

Again, one day no answer from dudey. Immediately I’m like ugh not again, and yes it was again. He gets arrested and I would never talk to him again even still. I only found out bc I searched and found him in the jails database. I am curious whatever happened to him and where he’s at. I no longer have a connect, withdrawals again, lil rough patch no big deal.

How fast did you guys break your new years resolution haha 

So last night a couple close friends and I had a get to gether to end the year off with good times.
Having a few beers, plenty of whiskey sours and enough bud to go around, we had a blast. Singing punk and folk songs around the camp fire, conversation filling the air. 

Starting to get a bit drunk, I decited to ask my friend if she could get me a 100mg Morphine. 
She hosted the party, and I know her mom has the motherload of medicine cabinets. 
Iv barked up this tree for years and its almost a joke now. As usual she doent comply lol

Being a bit drunk and confident, i took it upon my self to ask her mom. 
Im really close to the family and felt i could do it with out much repercussions. 

At first she was a bit shocked I even knew she had any opiates to begin with. But after a bit of sweet talking a making a shit load of popcorn she said ""ill see you inna sec"" and sent me on my way.

Out side for about 5 minutes, her mom comes out and stands away from everyone by the table. I get up and proceed to throw away my beer. 
""Come inside"" she whispered. 
I followed her into the kitchen and she explained ""I dont want to give you a 100mg because they are too strong, but I have this 30mg roxi and 30mg ir morph"" I couldint thank her enough. I offerd to pay, but she laughed and said to just wash her car...Fuckin DEAL! 

I get home and the drunk is wearing off as im preping both the roxi and morphine for IV. 
Iv never iv'd morphine but always wanted to. (I always plug) and dont think oxycodone is all that great iv unless you have alot imho. 

I figured this combo would be great since I love it so much with other ROAs
As soon as im swabbing my injection site my roomate comes home. 
Hes a opiphile aswell but doesnt iv, soo im lowkey about it. 
He brings home a half grizzy of blow. So i hold off on the nodd to enjoy some slopes with him;)

Today i wake up with a preloaded rigg 30mg of oxy and 30mg of morph. :):):)
I wake up with a ear to ear grin. 
Make coffe, take shower, play some vidya and call family. Now im ready...

Swabb site. And were off to the races. 
I push slow and steady and by time im half way through i start to feel eye pressure.
Befor i pull out the needle the pins and needles flood the lower half of my body and my legs are melting. 
Wow..... Just.. Wow
Iv never experienced a sensation like this. 
I have iv'd dilaudid and that was all a head rush with no legs. 

This, this was a new beast. 
Slowly the oxy began to take effect giving a pleasent euphoria to add but the morphine really stole the show. Great combo i might add. 

I melt in my seat, take a rip out the bole, spark a cigg and feel the eye pressure take over to a semi nodd state. 
Im in heaven. But do not take it for granted, i bask in the opiate soaked blanket that was once my skin.... Beautiful just beautiful. 

Though my tolerance was super low, and i could have enjoyed a bit stronger of a dose. All in all I enjoyed the hell out of it. Probably exactly the dose i needed since i had family dinner a few hours after and didint want to be all doped out...



Thanking the opiate gods for blessing me with this gift. These only come around so often... So thank you. 

Peace...

I really do want to quit. I know that I won't be able to until I start school tho because I just get so fucking bored when I'm sober it's miserable. I do love heroin tho, but I am just ready to make something of myself. 

I do tell myself that once I'm older, have money stacked, and kids are gone I will probably start using drugs regularly again. I mean I do really like drugs. At this point they're getting in the way of me becoming a better person, but when I die I'ma die happy and doing WTF I want lol.

I am nodding off. So, my gear seems to be getting the job done. I mentioned I was in the market for better (smokable) dope not Fent scramble. 
I told this guy Fent was cheap. He proceeded to tell me he pays $1500 for 20 grams; this seems a bit high to me. Anyhow, dude offers me a free bag whenever I want it. I told him I’m not in the market for anything beyond my best abilities to get diacetylmorphine. Moreover, I mentioned where he might find his Fent cheaper; he explained he is delving into getting a sprayer and putting the Fent in the soluble solution (like people do with benzo powders). 
Clearly, people aren’t even bothering to make Fent scramble anymore, they are just selling it as is. It’s good because at least people don’t try to pass this shit off as #4.

I got clean one year and two months ago. I was laying on a mattress in my living room, just staring at the wall and fucking hating myself. I did a massive line of dope and realized that self-loathing never went away...it was just was hiding under an opiate haze. I had an absolute moment of clarity and realized that I was going to die if I kept going--I checked myself into rehab the next day and never looked back.

My only real point is this: Being clean actually stops fucking sucking. It was really hard for the first few months...if for no other reason than having to re-remember how to be person and talk to people about things that weren't horror stories and really fucked up drug jokes. Having feelings again was super awkward; I honestly stumbled through a period of time where I felt like a robot learning to act human. I met some great people and some terrible ones. *But* my brain settled down and it didn't feel so weird anymore. I don't think about wanting heroin at all. I have a great job, an apartment, a boyfriend and I can actually afford nice things when I want them.

I'm not here to brag, or to tell you you should get clean--do your drugs if that's what you want to do--but if you want to quit and feel like you can't, I'm here to tell you that it's totally possible. It's a new year, people are making some bullshit resolutions...but it wouldn't be the worst to follow through with getting off your DOC this year, if you feel like it's eating away at you.

And if you're going to keep getting high, FFS get some Narcan and be smart about it. I've lost *so* many good people over the past few years and this subreddit has lost even more. Nod as safely as you can and stay on this Earth longer.

So basically I'm an IV heroin and coke addict who's been in and out of recovery for the last few years. I recently got kicked out of a halfway house and cut off from my Suboxone doctor, so I thought hey I'll just take bottles of immodium until I can get back on subs in my new area to stave off my withdrawals. Well, I basically became addicted to loperomide, and I was taking about 150 of them a day, constantly fucked up from them, never got back on my sub dose, and eventually started using heroin heroin again on top of the lope. So all of this has been going on in the last few months, and between the anxiety, the lope, and heroin and cocaine I realized that I hadn't shit in AT LEAST 10 days. I couldn't even remember when the last time I shit was, but normally I'd give myself  enough time each morning to shit  before I took all my drugs for the the day but with a lot on my mind recently it  just slipped from my thoughts. Well I realized this and freaked out, started reading about bowel compaction and getting even more scared. So I told myself I wouldn't take any opiates until I got this shit out, waited a day, nothing, day 2 nothing and the anxiety is really getting up there, plus I can't eat or drink anything without throwing it back up almost immediately. Day three which was yesterday, I spent literally the whole day sitting on the toilet trying to force myself to go, and nothing. I drank a whole damn bottle of milk of magnesia, and even gave myself a fucking enema with no luck. So basically last night I said if I couldn't shit by the morning I was gonna get gloves and pull that shit out with my hand, and by this time I was three days into full blow withdrawals with piles of opiates sitting in my drawer calling my name, but I stuck to my word, and FINALLY early this morning after three entire sleepless days of withdrawals, and spending my whole New Years completely alone and freaking out I got up and sat on my toilette and over the course of an hour and a half gave birth to what had to be at least 6 pounds of shit. It was one of the most painful experiences of my life, that even dopesickness couldn't chock itself up to, but I didn't care because the amount of relief I felt after that was practically enlightening. And on top of that I had myself a nice little 3 day tolerance break, and you can bet your ass that I ran straight to my stash and banged, sniffed and smoked everything I could immediately after I took that shit, and cried from the euphoria of it all. Anyway this was my first post and I read through the rules but let me know if I did anything wrong.

I’m feeling much better and was wondering if this would be okay to try again today only in a lower dose of course 20-25mgs combined with some of my promethazine.

I dont know if i can relive that hell again. Ive been debating getting a week of carries of methadone mixing with 10 or 20 xannys  and hoping thats enough to make me OD. I'm not afraid to OD anymore. Its happened 7 tines. Calmest way to die. I cant take the stress and unknowns anymore. I hope everyone else's 2018 is treating them better so far. Mine bent me over.

Raids and heavy crackdowns in the area have made getting our usual favorite dope a pretty big hassle. Yesterday we ended up with shit that was half assed packaged and wasn't up to the normal standard. Today we hit up his makn dude and he had us come a bit further than where we usually go to him. We also had to wait a bit in a shit part of the city. He had the same stuff as yesterday which at first was disappointing but then he surprised us by handing over not 5 but 16 bundles. He explained this is what's currently going around and while he'd normally not hook us up to that extent, we'd now be getting more for our money as these bundles are less potent and have less in them than the standard. So even with that in mind , him giving us 16 instead of 5 more than made up for the drop in quality and quantity.

I got 10 more grams because I love the stuff and used to use it maybe every other night for a few hours before bed to have some fun and it stayed a non-addiction the majority of the time.

Now, after getting my hands on it after wanting it for so long, I ended up taking a small dose to feel chill at first and then every hour I kept dosing and dosing and dosing and loving how careless, social, and euphoric I was. I was eating lunch in a coffee shop with my two close friends and I was so fucked by that point one ofnthe was talking straight to me and I was looking back at them not realizing I was being talked to. 

I'm on it currently to sleep because I actually have transient pain and don't have a script for real pain meds, but I already crave more and more and know how good it feels and how amazingly it cures life's ails but I don't want to get addicted and no offense to those who use dope but I'd rather keep my use to Tianeptine and keep it recreational but I fear that I won't be able to.

I tied it around my neck and figured if I shot myself and didn’t die, I’d at least be unconscious enough to still hang myself. I had the gun cocked and in my mouth. 

Then I suddenly got really tired. I had spent the last 7 or so months with no job after a shitty experience making me hate what I love best. I felt like a waste of heroin money sucking life. I figured I was better off dead to everyone than the burden I can be on and finding drugs. I thought it would make my boyfriend of 5 years less stressed. He calls me from work to make sure I’m not dead, a lot of times. 

I woke up to a phone call from a man I’ve been stopping in to see since April. I went to him for a job. He came looking for me... physically drove to my boyfriends workplace to ask if I’d work for him... bc I was so depressed I wouldn’t answer my phone. I ended up going away to a 40 day rehab and missing my opportunity. I felt worthless, coming home sober and jobless. I relapsed a few weeks later. So I get this call, it’s John. He needs someone to fill in tomorrow. Can I come? It was seriously like one of those moments where you don’t know what to do but just sob.

I got on methadone the following week. I haven’t held a gun or exercise band in my hand since. My boyfriend hasn’t found paintings of nooses in my sketchbook. I hope 2018 can look 2017 in the eye and say “fuck you”. 

My life has gotten infinitely better, though internally I feel infinitely worse— yet at least useful. That’s really all I wanted to say tonight. At least I’m here to say it, I suppose. ",1514938627.0

I am coming up on a BENZO ONLY induced euphoria.,"I know this isnt the benzo sub but im active here and know many of you dabble.

So I used the last of my opiates last night, and given my abundance of benzos (no massive tolerance but been using them the last 10 days or so), I thought I would give a bit of a cocktail a go.


T - 2 hours: 20mg omeprazole (inhibits CYP3A4, enzyme that breaks down many benzos, and also great with morphine, tramadol and codeine)


T - 1 hour: 200mg cimetidine (another CYP3A4 inhibitor but also inhibits CYP2D6 so dont use this one with your opiates)


T - 30 minutes: Two double expressos.


T = 0: 200mg Tetrazepam (a rarer, weakish benzo lacking hypnotic properties but has some anxiolytic and significant muscle relaxant action)


T + 10 minutes: 0.5mg alprazolam (xanax)


T + 15 minutes: 6mg Bromazepam (The god benzo) **and** 1.25mg lorazepam.


T + 30 Minutes: Climbing body warmth and everything feels cozy, significant anxiolysis, **cognitive euphoria** (that fuzzy, penetrating euphoria you get in like the basal center of your head, which I associate strongly with opiates, not quite as wholesome but its there).

Will be sublingualling 3mg bromazepam at the predicted peak and sipping on a half shot of rum+ iced tea. Will update.

*EDIT: T + 1 hour: 3mg Bromazepam + 0.5mg alprazolam sublingual.*

*T + 1.5 hours: wow I'm feeling as good if not better than 40mg of plugged morphine (low/mild tolerance).*",1514926865.0

I'm in Day 3 (more like 3.5) of withdrawal, and I'm hurting. Mentally a wreck. In 10 days I have a refill. And I'm debating going on this week and asking for an increase in dose, potentially fucking the whole thing up.

Do I risk it? Or just suffer through. 10 days seems like a fucking eternity. I'll get a bunch then.

I know the answer. Kratom is helping. Kpins too. Sleep is easy. Xanax is great for that.

When will the withdrawals stop so I can just be ok waiting a few days?

Also, question 2. I've gone to same doctor for 2 years. Never asked for an increase. Always same dose. I am on these meds long term. Could I have an honest talk and ask for a small increase? Explain that tolerance after 2 years has taken a toll and the pain is building. I take 3x10 a day. Would asking for 4, after never asking, never missing a pee test etc, set off any red flags?

Thanks community. Just need a little help. Had to step out to my car, had a little emotional breakdown. 

TLDR - just tell me that time is gonna go quick. And is asking for a small bump in dosage after 2 years a bad thing?

So I have been using off and on for about 8 or 9 years. I have gotten clean several times, the longest being a 2-3 year stretch. This last go round I had been using opium for about 2 years before switching back to H (my DOC). I have been on the H again since September, so about 3 months now.




Here's the odd bit. I've been going through 1 g of pretty decent #4 H every 2-3 days. I have been trying to cut back so I have been doing *slighhhtttly*, and I mean just slightly smaller shots. When I do these shots I will get the rush and the nods, but the euphoria is lacking and immediatly following the rush I get a wave a of anxiety and depression that lasts about 15 min. After it fades it's business as usual. It doesn't happen when I take a proper sized shot.  This kind of thing has never happened and seems quite odd. Anyone else have experience with this?

I still look forward to sharing past tales about Cliff but I do not want to forge any new experiences. Last year I learned how is easy it was to get burned. I've come out of this year having better protected my interests but there is folly in hanging out someone like Cliff. I shouldn't have to always be on high alert when doing business with a ""friend"" in order to ensure he doesn't get one-up on me. I'd be so much better off if I just cut Cliff out of my life like so many suggest upon reading my tales.

&nbsp;

On odd weeks Cliff gets a benzo script. His hustle is to trade them up for dope. It seldom works out and in the past I used to pick up his benzo script from the pharmacy. One time he said ""would you pick it up if there was a good chance you'd have something before work?"" At the time I was nearly dope-sick so I was like hell yeah... Instead in that scenario Cliff consumed a bunch of benzos, was in and out of consciousness and mumbled through any conversations.


Most recently, I covered my ass. Bought subs and did not go through Cliff to get them because he's super unreliable for that. He did offer to get subs and I told him that's great, and that I would be happy to give him the money the minute I saw those subs in front of my face. He stopped mentining that sub connect a day later and re-focused on his hustle to get dope.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I was off from work but told Cliff I was working because I didn't want him calling my house phone or kocking on my door. He eventually texted ""text me back asap"" but none of his messages indicated why he was messaging me. Maybe I'd jump if there was a guarantee that he would give me some money he owes me but in all likelyhood he'd ask me to bike to the ATM to get his money because he's fat and lazy. 


Bottom line, I'm to run errands for him when it's 15 degrees outside. Plus there is a codependency thing going on here and it needs to be broken. I've taken steps in the right direction because I was sick of going into withdrawal. We all know that counting on Cliff's word to stay well often ends in me writing sad tales.

&nbsp;

Can I just keep avoiding him? Probably not and will have to confront him soon. I left an old MacBook at his house, I'd like to maintain pretenses long enough to get that back so for these days where I avoid him... perhaps I'll just make up a story like he usually does. ""I was sick"" or ""some bullshit came up""... 


I dunno.. I'm just glad I took steps to keep myself well and held on to my cash for my own purposes as it should be. Worst case hte old.

oral bioavailability of morphine is around 25-30% (as i know) so hwow much i need to take to feel.. you know, great?
i could sniff that, but not sure if it's possible with these pills, and IV isnt for me, yet.

Iv also wondered how quickly your body metabolizes Fent, and how much builds up in your system at any given point. (For example, if my body moves through it at a rate which allows 4 hours of the drug to build up, I would have 44mcg active in my system during the duration of the patch.)

any advice for how to use one of these guys safely? Iv gotten quite lucky with past fent use, and I fucking love the stuff, and I know that this is the smallest dosage available, but im still not trying to fuck around with something im not prepared for and end up dead.

I did binge on a bunch of hydro I managed to snag for a few days a couple weeks ago and I used kratom to deal with withdrawals from that but again, it was a couple of weeks ago. My question is basically what do y’all think I should do to improve the high? Take more? Try a different ritual to avoid learned tolerance? Take a long break? I already potentiate my opes with hydroxizine, Benadryl, Tagamet, tums and sometimes grapefruit juice/tonic water with quinine, but if y’all have any other suggestions on that front I’m all ears.

no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.

no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.

no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type. this appears to be less of a problem with the new chat app.)

For whatever reason (I guess I get sloppy sometimes no matter how careful I try to be), I've got a bunch of very small puddles and chunks of black that have melted from being small and subjected to room temperatures. It looks like I could probably salvage a shot out of it, which I'm *well aware* is desperate, ""carpet crawling"" level junkiedom, but what can I say? I'm a frugal junkie, and sometimes you find yourself in desperate times with no dope. 

So, my question to you, dear reader, is if anyone has any ideas on how I can possibly put together a shot from these disparate little bits of dope on the top of a table, I'd be much obliged (and no, scraping them off the table isn't an option, they're like little dried droplets or melted microchunks of tar). 

I've had a similar quandary with bags of tar in powder form where the sticky powder has dried all over the inside of the bag, and Im sure there's a decent little shot there somewhere, but collecting it all together into a shot has proven difficult to engineer.

I'm posting here because I really don't know who to talk to or where else to turn. I'm a heroin addict and have been for a few years now, I went in and out of rehab a few times and the last time I got clean I was living in a sober house. Long story short I ended up getting kicked out, and I had to move back to my old city. As this happened I also got cut off by my Suboxone doctor. I started getting sick and I remember hearing about how loperomide helped with withdrawals so I started taking it. My plan was to just take it until I could get set up with a new Suboxone doctor but I basically ended up getting addicted to immodium. I'm really scared honestly, because I don't want to be on it at all, and I know about the damage that it can do to the heart, the stomach and the body. I've been living in constant fear and anxiety because no matter what I do I can't seem to wean myself off of it. I have a few Suboxone strips but they don't seem to fully suppress the withdrawal from immodium so I always end up going back to it. I'm not getting high on it at all, I'm purely doing it to keep myself from being sick. It's been about a month since I started using it daily in large doses. I can't do this anymore. I did not come this far to die from a heart attack from fucking loperomide. I don't know what my options are, I don't know who to turn to. I have a doctor and insurance but I haven't gone to them yet because I thought maybe I could wean myself off alone. Please if anyone has any advice or has been through something similar, I need help. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to die. I just want to be clean and living my life and I'm terrified. Any help or advice at all would be helpful.  And again I'm aware of the effects this stuff will have on the body, so I'm not really looking to be scolded or made more scared than I already am. Just please help me figure out how I can get off this shit ",1515032404.0

Calls me again at about 3. I'm thinking, ""Jesus dude, you know what's up."" I answer anyway and he said ""get your ass outside.""

I don't really have strong cravings to take the Oxys while I'm on the Kratom. I mean of course the Kratom isn't as good as Oxy but it's better than I thought it would be.

But the Oxys are just there. I regret buying them but I can't bring myself to flush them. I'm leaving the country in a few days and won't be back for a couple of months at least and will have no access while I'm away. Guess that helps me justify using them.

I did feel a little bit high after about an hour, but no come up what so ever. I know the pills weren't bunk (they're prescription) so what could it have been? Here are some variables... 

- I took them at 7pm, and I did eat something small at about 4pm... Is it possible I ate too soon? 

- I did do Kratom that day, about 9 hours before, and it was a longer lasting Kratom than usual... Could that have affected it? 

- My lowest dose IS 22.5mg, and I started with 20mg and added 5mg about 15 minutes later... Could the staggering of the dose be why I didn't feel a come up or rush? 

I'm going to try again tonight. What do you suggest? Not eating for 4 hours beforehand? Waiting longer than 9 hours after Kratom? (It would be 11 hours by the time I'm planning) Would taking the whole dose at once help?

Its okay to fail a few times, if you're failing you're trying. Just be careful with the dose when relapsing because your tolerance will be lower and shit can get dangerous.

Think of something to do with your free time instead of getting high, i would recommend something outside the house but i didn't had many options and instead opted for gaming.

Years ago when the company I worked for changed health insurance, we were stuck with an HMO that seemed to be against young-ish patients treating chronicle pain with narcotics, so I was cut off cold turkey. I panicked, had no clue what to do. I grovelled at the feet of my doctors, begged, then got pissed and decided to figure out how to treat my own pain. I had heard about online pharmacies so I just started scouring the internet and eventually found the forums. Anyhow, that was my start of online drug communities.

So anyhow, how I came to find this place was just me missing my online friends and the comradery of the old forums. 

I quickly realized this place was different than what I was used to in an online forum geared around pharms. Here folks are doing heroin and talking about it openly. I hate to say this but being honest I had a preconceived notions about heroin addicts because I had never been around it. Society had me scared of heroin addicts and homeless people. I was even freaked out about giving folks flying signs any money because they'd have to come near me. That was before RO 

Y'all, let me tell you how being here (mostly reading, commenting occasionally and posting a couple times when I needed your insight) has done for me as a person...

I see you and by that I mean I understand you. My struggles may not be anywhere close to what you have to go thru but I get it now. I'm no longer afraid. I no longer see homelessness and/or people holding signs as something to be afraid of. Being here has truly opened my eyes and heart in such a good way 💛

I've seen so much compassion flowing around here and a general caring for each other that I've not seen before. Sure there's the occasional burst of troublemakers (trolls) but I've seen folks try to give even the most belligerent/rude folks benefit of the doubt and a chance to change their behavior. But for the most part the level of caring and helpfulness overrides the negetive that creeps in occasionally. 

Just wanted to share how being part of this community has enriched my soul.

Stay safe 💛💛

At this time i have never really done any ""hard drugs"" besides tripping on acid/ shrooms a few times. of course, i smoke weed every single day. 
So i tried this per 10 and had a good experience, i really enjoyed the high it gave me but i didn't really have a desire to do it again. 
months later, the same friend who introduced me to the perc 10, offered me to split the price with him on a blue 30mg roxy. I was nervous about trying it because its basically medical grade heroin but we still got a hold of it.
We split it in half and i broke a tiny chunk off of my half and crushed it up and snorted it. WOW. AMAZING. I LOVE THIS.
The high i got from sniffing an very small chunk of a 30mg roxy was one of the best feelings I've ever had, up there with sex, and tripping on acid/shrooms, except this shit is addicting.
fast forward a few months and here i am buying my own roxys. i went from doing a quarter of a quarter of the pill to sniffing half of it, to sniffing the whole thing, to sniffing 5 in one day, (5 was the most i did in one day) 
HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART
i have been doing at least one blue a day since august, maybe only a few sober days here and there but for the most part i have been addicted to roxys since the summer and i want to stop.
I am expecting withdrawal symptoms of course but i was wondering if anyone can predict how bad they are going to be/ how long they will last if i quit cold turkey. I spent at least $3000 on these pills and i just want to be done with them. I told myself that i would quit on jan 1st but that went out the window. I still have 4 blues left to try to taper myself off of them. anyone got any advice for me?
I cannot let my parents know about this, they are extremely closed minded and strict about me even smoking weed, so they would have a meltdown if they found out i am addicted to Roxy
I just don't want anything bad to happen to me. Thanks for reading this ramble jamble of words that describes my down falling life.i just wanna be happy without using hard drugs !

I have been taking 10mg norco for a while now. Norco is 10mg hydrocodone and 325mg acetaminophen. I take 3 to 4 per day. I know it's an issue, not here for it.

Anyway, sometimes when I can't get Norco, I will buy Oxycodone 30mg. I'll take a 4th of the pill at a time: 7.5mg oxycodone. I do get happy and high when I take them, but I notice I am not as carefree as I am with Norco. I almost WANT to be mad. I almost WANT to complain, I WANT to find things about people that are wrong in my eyes and then berate them about them. Of course, I don't do this. But this is no where near the kind of person I am. 

Sometimes when I take too much Norco, if I take one then forget and take another, taking double my dose (20mg), I do get a little irritated because I feel like I am overwhelmed with the high and I can't focus on what's going on around me, so I get flustered. This is much different than the irritability that oxycodone makes me feel. 


TLDR; Hydrocodone makes me happy while Oxycodone makes me angry. 10mg Hydro, and 7.5mg Oxy taken at a time. Anyone else experience this?

Size of problem - up to 3-400 mg per day

Duration - ~16 months

More context - on SSRIs for anxiety and depression already, so I know where I’m about to get kicked. 

Prior to quitting, I was able to switch to kratom for a month or two (or three, who knows), which is every bit as addictive. I think it should remain legal, since it’s pretty much impossible to OD on it and I’m more of a choose-your-own-adventure kinda guy, but the K advocates arguing it’s not addictive should tell that to my toilet.  Kratom is extremely addictive and withdrawals will be hell, kid (I’m talking to a kid now). 

Nonetheless, I tapered for about two weeks prior to quitting.  I officially logged Dec. 28 as Day 1 & I’m going to be clean for 2018. 

Day 1 & 2 weren’t bad, with the help of some pregbalin.

Day 3 is when shit hit the fan (& everywhere else). Despite flying myself to a beach before doing this, I didn’t crawl out of my room starting here until Day 6 (even then it’s hard). RLS was the worst and most persistent symptom. Tylenol, Xanax, and loperamide helped with the rest. 

Day 4 & 5 were the peak but same symptoms as Day 3.   Yes, I wanted to die. But you’ll get through it. My advice is to take what you need, within reason, to get past this point.  2 dose of NyQuil, OR Lyrica, OR benzos.  Just don’t mix meds that do the same thing in the same day.   I wish i had clonodine, too. Just be careful- that shit affects your heart rate and you don’t realize how much you’ve had until your hands are cold. 

Day 6 was my first day where my head almost felt normal but I was overwhelmed by the butterflies seeming to start at my belly and taking over the rest of me. Pregbalin helped a lot with this (& this is the first day where I imagined how easy it would be to have a Lyrica problem). 

Day 7 I was able to stay off the benzos & I went for a full body massage. The RLS lessened But was still bad enough to keep me up at night, to an extent.  This was the first day that beta blockers were enough to help with my anxiety. Before, they couldn’t cut through at all. 

Day 8 was more of the same but the butterflies have reduced each morning since Day 5. I went almost the entire day with nothing but knew I’d need the pregbalin to sleep. Reduced my dosage to 75 mg from a peak of ~6-900 mg. 

Day 9 was almost almost close to normal outside of the sometimes bad anxiety but I popped a 150 mg pregbalin anyway. I shouldn’t have. Not taking this shit tomorrow (it’s now Day 9).  I don’t want to trade addictions. 

The amount of crying I’ve done over television story arcs today is a testament to the amount of suppressed emotion I’ve had over the past year and change. It’s not the worst thing, by any stretch. Legs are still kicking but it’s manageable. 

I’ve worked out most days, somehow. It hasn’t helped give me any kind of relief yet but a lot of others have found it useful. It does keep my mind occupied for an hour though. 

I have not had any problems eating. I have, however, had problems keeping it in me. 


Updates::

Day 10 - So far so good. I have more moments of clarity and less anxiety. I know I’m passed the worst of it. Popped some loperamide but nothing else, so far. That may change tonight if I have trouble sleeping. I need to get off the Lyrica. It’s already stopped being effective, which I can recognize intellectually, but i can see a future where I’m popping it anyway. Besides, it’d be nice to preserve these for episodes, etc.  I have to go to a giant social thing in New Orleans, of all places, for a few days next week and even the thought of it gives me anxiety. Going to head to the beach and try to focus on the now for a bit. Main symptoms are moderate anxiety, bathroom stuff, and a lot of random emotional bursts, which have only really served to get my gf to stop returning my texts. 

Day 11 - up for two hours and haven’t eaten. Did not sleep well after my first long period of no Lyrica. RLS was moderate and more intermittent last night. Also on my first day after feeling the rush of initial moments of clarity, where the boredom of sobriety serves as an effective counterweight. Whether it’s Tylenol, or Aleve, or whatever, I just constantly want to take something to help any errant symptom. Going to go force myself to eat something small and then try to take a nap. That should help. 



Postscript From Original::

I also have zero support system. One person knows what I’m doing and she doesn’t seem much interested in the process. Hoping this writing helps myself, at the least. When I get back from the beach in a few days, I’m going to look up meetings or something. 

Happy to post updates or answer any Qs if anyone is interested. 

Answering my main question prior to starting — Day 6 was the first day I could see a light at the end of the tunnel. 

My second question was when I’d feel “normal” again. My hope is it’s Day 10. Wish me luck :)

I'm looking to start my detox from oxycodone either today or tomorrow. I've been on and off oxycodone for about a year, so I've done this a few times- not proud.

Anyway I have 1.5 Subs (the pill form). I also have xanax and kpins to help- I never take either really, just not for me.  Anyone have the best way to go about this?  My main concern is possibly having seizure and possibly ending up in the hospital. I am definitely scared about this possibility. Should I stay away from the xanax and hope I'm good with just a sub? I usually prefer the sub strips as I think the pill form sucks. Will the xanax put me at  risk?

I was thinking about most likely starting Saturday morning. Waking up, taking a quarter xanax, and see how long I could make it without a sub. Is this a bad idea? I am aware of taking subs too soon about precipitated WD but intend  to only need 12 hours for subs. Seriously just want to do this safely and ensure I don't end up having a seizure or end up in the hospital, or worse case dead.


I'm taking anywhere between 180-240mg a day to give you an idea. In the past, once I make it to day 3 I usually turn the corner and feel much much better.

Thanks you all!!!!",1515136443.0

I cold-copped for myself for the longest time, but a couple months ago I decided not to renew my lease (I was in the downtown [other smaller East Coast area with a huge dope market] area) and so now I've been staying further out in the suburbs and just have NO way of making it out there.

I realize you've already gone through both sides of the vein. But if the syringe fills with blood as you pull out, and you push down, is there a chance it'll work? Or is it destined to fail at that point no matter what since you already poked a hole in the other side of the vein?

hello everyone first post been lurking daily for a few months and love the discussion/content. anyway i created this account to ask this question. i have the typical story took percs here and there from a teenager til about a year ago when my son was born. that makes me sound like a scumbag i know and i kinda am but ive been an alcoholic daily drinker since 16 and knew i couldn’t be drunk all the time with a newborn (im late 20s now btw). So I drank rarely but started taking percs more often at first, justifying that i didnt like to nod and i only like the energetic euphoric side to opiates and i wasnt addicted to them because my problem was alcohol. i still didnt think i was “fully” addicted until i tried to quit on January 1st for 30 days (no alcohol included) and only take kratom, after 2 months of both opiates everyday and alcohol almost everyday. on the 2nd (about 36 hours in) i woke up in a pool of sweat after a rough nights sleep.  yesterday was the same and i realized i was in withdrawal. today i woke up about the same but not quite as bad and was feeling optimistic. i hung out with my son and started making breakfast for my wife who was out getting groceries and felt ok, and just feeling ok made me feel happy. then she came home and freaked on me a little bit because i left her credit card in my wallet and she couldn’t pay for the groceries at checkout, which she was justified in doing but it triggered this insane manic episode in me. i turned off the eye of stove i was heating up, put the eggs and shit back in the fridge and said i was sorry and started heading upstairs and she got a little more pissed because she thought i was being a dick. i collapsed on our bed and started crying, then sobbing. i started hyperventilating and shaking and thinking about how much of a worthless pile of shit i was. what a weak pussy i was, how i couldn’t do anything right, how she didnt want to fuck me anymore and why would she im disgusting (we have sex everyday) how my son didn’t need me no one did and i should kill myself. how i never tried to accomplish any of my dreams and how i never would, and just let everyone down. how i secretly did heroin on christmas while hanging out with them, on my baby’s first christmas. and if i hadn’t i wouldn’t have enjoyed it. how the only reason i enjoyed watching a Charlie Brown christmas with my little baby and my wife was cuz i was high and that made the memory worthless anyway. i punched myself repeatedly in the head and face telling myself i wasn’t strong enough to leave a mark or protect my family (Now face covered in bruises). she tried to come upstairs and apologize even though it really had nothing to do with her or what she said. i called my guy and got him to front me five 20mg percs. 85 dollars gone before pay day. she picked them up for me, i told her she didnt have to and i could call him back and cancel. she said she was over it/me and got them. 

we talked for awhile and we’re good again. she’s asleep on the couch, baby’s asleep upstairs. i am scared for my future and don’t want to be this person, i wasn’t like this before. my baby deserves a good dad. i dont want my wife to tell them someday i killed myself or overdosed. i have now almost fully come down from the hundred millis and don’t ever wanna be in that mental state again. I need to be happy for my family, and not a fucking junkie or an alcoholic. 

For those that have stopped and powered through that depression from such, how did you do it? what did you change? or do u just have to be insanely sad for awhile and hope it goes away? maybe if i had kratom that morning it wouldnt have happened, but that would have just prolonged the inevitable right? im sorry for rambling and if this doesn’t even make sense. Im mentally exhausted and feel pathetic for making it not even 4 days in. and just to clarify I don’t think I would ever really hurt myself intentionally besides the punching thing I did today.",1515125957.0

Well, my psychiatrist has also been prescribing me TEN 5mg tablets of Diazepam every 30 days. Just to help with sleepless nights as my body rests it's pain scores in the next 30-40 days. I don't & haven't been taking it daily but today I needed it and was out of it and due for a refill.

So, my Dr called it in and I picked it up. I got home and took what I thought was a 5mg tablet because I had been having muscle spasms and needed a little sleep. However, I slept for 5hours so when I woke up I grabbed the script and checked it out. 

Turns out the pharmacy prescribed me WAYYYY more than they should have. They did THIRTY 10mg diazepam tablets!!! I was shocked. It's like Junkie Jesus is trying to drag me back into hell.

So, I called my doctor and was like, ""uhhhh yah I have way more pills than I should"" He advised I take 5 out for the month, and give the rest to my parents to give me 5 tablets every 30 days for the next 6 months. Since I now basically have a 6 month supply of it. 

The instruction now is to break them in half to make them 5mg tablets. Knowing me I'll probably make 2.5mg tablets by breaking them into 4ths.

Anyway, my dilemma now is that even though I've been honest about it with my doctor IDK if I really want my parents holding onto them. In the past, they've denied me access to medications (opiates) that I've needed and its always a fight. I don't want to get back into counting pills with them either. So, dunno.

I remember there was one guy on here from Ireland who found a bag with like 3 ounces in it.

I ordered 14g of gunpowder on the DNMs last week for $800, and when the vendor didn't ship it out before the weekend, I opened a dispute, because the world revolves around me and I found it wholly unacceptable for him not to structure his life around feeding my drug habit.

I wasn't even looking to get a refund, I was just pitching an e-tantrum because I am a dopesick brat, but a day or two after I had opened the dispute the vendor sends a message to the effect of ""I can't find your tracking number, so here's your money back.""  My dope arrived today, and it is fire.  So I got half an ounce for free by being a spoiled cunt.

Other than that, the best I can think of was when I ordered a ball of ECP from a vendor and he accidentally shipped me the same order twice.  I actually handled this one in an honorable fashion and told the vendor what happened, and I was getting ready to send him $300 for the extra dope, but before I could do it he got banned for scamming people.  So I don't feel bad about that one.

To be clear I'm not talking about withdrawals, obviously those are terrible. 

I find is semi-enjoyable, obviously not as good as the peak but still pretty chill and I tend to nod, even on the comedown.

I'd be interested in the neurophysiology of this. Do opiates deplete dopamine? While the comedown is fine, I do often feel pretty bad the next day and assume it's down to this, although a fair few people have said it's more down to dehydration.

**Entry 28** - Friday, 4:58 PM

Relieved to say we survived the storage closet. Chloe, Ben, Spooner, and I made it to the nurse’s office in the detox ward. I really thought we were goners there for a minute. I was actually praying, which is not something I do. It sounded like the people were piling up outside the door, finally about to break through. Out of nowhere, we hear a lot of commotion, things breaking, lots of grunting. Slowly the noise volume got lower and lower, until all that remained was a fragile silence. 

We cracked the door open as quietly as possible. There was Ben, in all his glory, standing in the middle of the hallway. He looked at us excitedly through his messy hair. Bruised and bloodied, he fell to his knees with a metal pipe in his right hand and Spooner, unmoving, slumped over his left shoulder. 

He had seen us go into the storage closet but was busy trying to wake up the unconscious Spooner so they could come rescue us. Spooner wouldn't wake up so he just bludgeoned his way to us on his own, with Spooner in one arm and a 3ft. cast-iron pipe in the other. 

After the rescue, we began to hear more bodies coming from the stairwell so we quickly darted past the double doors into the detox ward only to find about 30 of them in the next hallway. They all stopped and slowly turned to look at us in unison. We made a dash for the first door which happened to be the nurse’s office, which is where we are now.


**Entry 29** - Friday, 5:37 PM

It feels like we will be safe for the time being. We have in front of us the strongest door in the building with double deadbolt locks and a steel reinforced window. The walls are made of cinderblocks, with tile flooring all around. So, the entry point is heavily secured and is the only way in. But, it’s also the only way out. There is no food in here, and the only water is a nearly empty water dispenser used when people take their meds.

Ben hung up a cloth behind the windows to prevent the things out there from looking in. They seem to get more agitated when they can see us. The doctor and one of the orderlies that had harassed Chloe were out there, along with Joey and a few other familiar faces. It's a mix of residents and staff, and couple people I have never seen before.

Chloe is working on getting Spooner to come to. He is hardly breathing and his lips are turning blue. We are pretty sure he overdosed.


**Entry 30** - Friday, 6:16 PM

Still in the nurse’s room. We splashed the rest of the water on Spooner’s face to try and get him to wake up, but it did nothing. We will keep trying anything we can.

It’s probably starting to get dark outside, and the emergency lights in here are beginning to dim. We have been discussing whether or not what’s going on in here is also going on out in the city.

Before he rescued us, Ben was in a room that had a window facing across the street. He said it looked like a hurricane had come through the town. Windows busted out, debris all over the street, no cars driving in the street, and no people walking around. 

What Ben had seen plus all the eerie signs in the previous few days--police/ambulance sirens, tense staff, mom not answering phone, no visitors--leads me to believe this may be going out there as well. 


**Entry 31** - Friday, 7:02 PM

Spooner is finally awake. Ben broke through the lock on the med cabinet and Chloe found narcan within it. She must not have ever had to administer narcan before because she did it Pulp Fiction style. She jabbed that damn needle in his neck and he rocketed upright, eyes wide. I told her if she ever needs to do that to me, if she’d politely stick it in my thy instead.

Once Spooner got his bearings, he started freaking out once he realized where we are. He claims the “junkies” are attracted to the opiates. That’s why they are accumulating outside, from all the opiate medication in here. He says that even if it’s in your system, they can smell it.

I write this as the bitter orange taste of the suboxone still lingers under my tongue. I couldn’t help myself after Ben opened up the med cabinet and I saw boxes upon boxes of 8mg strips. I also threw a few bottles of 1mg alprazolam in my backpack for good measure. In the midst of the situation, I didn't think this was timely to be coming off meds completely. Although, if Spooner is correct, I will come to regret that decision while the suboxone remains in my system.

Oh, and Spooner *did* overdose--on carfentanil that he had snuck in on the back of postage stamps. Which, apparently, means that it was not the Narcan that brought him out of his OD because, “Naloxone isn’t strong enough to push carfent off the receptors you idiot.”

So I guess it was just the lucky neck punch chloe delivered that shook him out of it.


**Entry 32** - Friday,  8:40 PM

From what I can see by peeking through the makeshift curtains, there are more of them amassing outside the door. It’s hard to say for sure, because the smoke doesn’t allow me to see very far, but I would guess that there are at least 40 out there. It’s clear they know we are in here. 

They all seem have similar attributes: enormously dilated pupils, rough skin covered in goosebumps, stiffly raised body hair, plenty of sweat, and an awkward  gait.

Chloe's is calling them zombies.

Spooner has dubbed them either simply “Junkies,” or, my favorite, “Stringers,” because that’s what he calls people who don't care about looking strung out.

Ben just calls them crackheads.


**Entry 33** - Friday, 10:04 PM

We are preparing to leave the room, we’ve been trapped in here for about 5 hours and the crowd outside is only getting bigger. The smoke is in the room with us now. It must be a large fire but no one has seen any flames yet. Ben is removing the tiles to the roof so we can escape that way. A few days ago, I had stolen a diagram of the building layout from Doug’s office to aid my escape. So, if we get up above the ceiling I believe I can lead us out.

I’ve packed everything that could be of use to us--a few first aid kits, some sharp tools, all kinds of meds, and a couple of granola bars. Our goal right now is to make our way to the dinning hall, so we can have food and water if we need to wait this out. Or, at worst, we can steal some car keys from one of the offices over there and get off the property all together. We are just going to have to play it by ear once we get out there and asses the situation. That is, if we make it that far.

During those 5 years I did a lot of drinking, a lot of molly, and a looot of psychedelics. I could eat a tenstrip and people would barely even be aware that I was tripping face.

Once I got back into doing blow and opiates on the regular though, I noticed that I couldn’t trip like I used to at all, and could barely even handle two tabs without taking at least a klonopin before and after. I had a series of really bad trips and only drop L a couple times a year these days.

I stopped doing blow regularly too in the past year or so cause my comedowns were getting way too harsh. I also see shadow people and get really bad brain zaps whenever I do more than like 1 cap of molly so I only do that on special occasions as well.

I know for sure that my issues with blow are a result of my lacking dopamine, but could that also be the reason why I can’t trip like I used to? I never reach that place of euphoric understanding and connection to the universe anymore. Even with benzos I still feel anxious while tripping when I do.

Update from yesterday,"A sincere thank you to everybody who offered assistance or kind words to me yesterday, it really meant a lot to me after not having anyone answer a call or text all day to have complete strangers offer to get me there by any means. Seriously, thank you.

 IM SO FED UP WITH THIS SYSTEM! So after freezing my ass off and a two and a half hour journey with no money, in 12 degree weather, i arrived at the assessment center. Ostensibly, to sign the one release THEY FORGOT TO HAVE ME SIGN DAYS AGO when i got the assessment done. Simple right? nah of course not, r/opiates knows how its goes!! Anything that can go wrong will.

 To give a little backround to set the stage, Im 24. been doing heroin since 16 but didnt get really bad until my mom died at 20. I've been through the wringer with this addiction. Rehabs,halfway houses, recovery houses, outpatients,cold turkey in jail, you know how it goes. I'm on probation right now. Anyway, I've been home from jail and living with my dad since July, got a new PO who is honestly pretty great (as far as cops go) she seems to be sympathetic to the cause and wants to help me and not lock me up. Great! The day after Xmas she calls me in. FUCK! hot urine for sure. i was high when she called me, BUT I decided to go against ALL my junkie instincts this time. i didnt run, or lie, or fake the piss test. I walked into her office and admitted that I was using and I needed help. Was expecting to go right to jail, she says you need to go get an assessment and be in rehab tomorrow.(Last wednesday)So that's what i do (prolly the 5th time ive been through the process at this assessment center) they say we will call you when we get a bed for you. Normal stuff so far. HERES WHERE THE FUCKERY BEGINS.

Last friday my dad comes in snapping ""why arent you in rehab yet"" ""youre lying"" ""you prolly never got the assessment"". So i called my insurance company to see when I would have a bed. they said ""We're just waiting on your paperwork to get faxed over from the assessment center SHOULD BE LESS THAN AN HOUR"". Well, the never sent it over and left for the weekend. My PO and My dad are flipping out thinking I'm playing games and stalling for time (not true but I understand their POV) Monday comes and they call me and tell me they messed up and forgot to have me sign some bullshit release form and to come in wednesday(yesterday) and they're very sorry for the mistake but its just as simple as I sign the paper, and the rehab would pick me up......Obviously you guys know what i went through yesterday to get there. I WAS SO HAPPY TO MAKE IT THERE against all my junkie thoughts, and shitty weather and logistical problems. I was proud. Anyway, I ask to see the woman who did my assessment but she refused to see me and had me sign the paper at the front desk. Weird but w.e. I sign the paper and ask when i can expect the rehab to pick me up. She gives me a side eyed look and closes the partition in my face and eventually sends out some other lady who said ""we're sorry but they no longer have a bed for you BECAUSE YOU TOOK TO LONG!!!"" (I'm mildly dopesick at this point and exhausted) I kinda snapped a little and asked for the supervisor or whoever was in charge and sat my ass down, explained the situation and told him I wasn't going to leave unless it was to the rehab lol Had him call My PO and my Dad and explain that I'm doing everything humanly possible to do the right thing and THEY were the ones causing the delays and bullshit. and that if they did what they were supposed to, that i would have gotten into rehab a week ago....Eventually They tell me to go home and they'll call me when the next bed opens up..... So I went home, now fully dopesick... AND WAKE UP THIS MORNING TO SIX INCHES OF SNOW AND NO UPDATE ABOUT REHAB. This got way longer than i wanted it to be but i just had to get it off my chest. IM SO FUCKING FRUSTRATED IVE BEEN FUCKING BEGGING FOR HELP, DOING WHATEVER THE FUCK IT TAKES. they've wasted a fucking week of my life, almost my freedom, a full fucking trek through the artic blast. AND treated me like someone who doesnt matter, who doesn't deserve respect. IM SICK OF GETTING JERKED AROUND BY THESE PEOPLE.

 ""(hEy KeNZo MaYbE YOu ShOULdnT bE A DoPEfIEnD tHeN YoU DoNT hAVe To DeaL WiTH tHIs) ""... Fair point. This situation is 100% my fault, I relapsed, THAT is the root cause of all of this bullshit. I take full responsibility for that. Accepted the consequences, and made the effort to get help. My point is, WHEN SOMEONE BEGS FOR HELP, WHEN ITS FUCKING LIFE OR DEATH. and I PROMISE you it is very much life or death for me right now, the system NEEDS to be better than this. I feel like im in the twilight zone! My dboy never gave me the run around for 8 fucking days, but my county did. I know i sound like a whiny bitch and that this is an absurdly long rant at this point, but this is my life. And if i fucking die before I get help, nobody will lose their job or even bat an eye, or remember my fucking name. WE DESERVE BETTER. I love you guys, thanks for the support.

7o57dr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7o57dr/as_requested_spider_story_ie_how_i_fell_off_my/,9,https://redd.it/7o57dr,Cujuabled,As Requested - Spider Story. i.e. How I Fell Off my Meth Hustle Because Some Bitch's Mom is Afraid of Spiders,"I know I'm atrociously late and I apologize, things have been busy to say the least. The events I'm about to describe happened several days ago now, but the effects still have me in a much worse position than before. How I lost my cash and product is going to sound pretty fucking insane and astronomical in its occurance, but that's only because it is. Still 100% bitter, still no chance of getting any of it back from that tweaker ass hoe.

So basically I was runnin around in the skanky city just over the highway doin my thing. At this point I have a horrible predisposition to this city, definitely experienced more trauma than wonder here. It's notorious for immense trap houses and car thievery. Like everyone there is a car thief and there was this big multi-car-jacking case like 9-10 months ago that my homies were involved with and it was fucking nuts, so I'm considering telling that one from for the most part an outside perspective, we'll see. Anyway. I was just going to trap houses, going to people's houses, meeting at 7/11, selling meth, making calls, getting people in touch so I didn't have to do the work, making trades, etc etc. It was very busy at this point, and I was powering through with no sleep on the past 60 hours and maybe 700 calories. I was very light headed, my lips and hands kept going kinda numb, and at one point I thought it safe to assume I was going to pass out. Before going into a trap house I made the connection that these people don't give a singular fuck about me, just my drugs. That's fine by me, but if I do have the misfortune of passing out then these goons are going to run my pockets and throw me out the door. So I stuff my cash and my product in my sock. I've never done this before in my life, but I've seen plenty of people do it. So I go about my excursions and don't pass out. 

After a couple hours I get a text and am being invited to dinner by this family I know. I mainly know the daughter and her cousin who's in town for holiday, her cousin and I go way back and she's leaving town tomorrow. I would like to see her and a change of environment is always nice. So here's the thing about this family... they're like a house whose frame is rotted. Looks great when you're walking up to the door step, step inside still wonderful, but so much as dig a measly fingerpoke in the wall and you see the rot and smell the stench of what it really is. At first glance they look drug free, middle class and happy, but look longer than a first glance can hold and their facade crumbles, and they get angry about it. It's kind of heart breaking honestly. The reality and truth of it is that they all do hella meth, their actions and reactions are entirely based on off the wall, unstable emotions and a construed sense of instinct. They are entirely unstable and unpredictable which can often lead to pointless arguments getting physical. There are two boys who the youngest, the rest are girls. With that context laid out, naturally it's one of those houses where you have to take your shoes off and shit, even though they have hard wood floors so wtf? Not gonna get into that. 

I walk in, hug people, talk loudly to greet whoever isn't in the entry way, and take my shoes off. Well oh fuck wait there's a wad of cash and a bunch of fucking meth sticking out of my sock like the best tumor you could ask for. I have one arm that I can use efficiently and people looking at me, so as subtly as I could I slip those valuable into my shoe while I'm bent down taking them off and moving them, my pocket would have been much too obvious. So we get to the table, eating and bullshitting, mom is runnin around being a Flail-Bot 3000, she's fuckin everywhere clearly gacked out of her mind. Whatever though it's dinner, what do you expect? She leaves the dining room a few times, her constant changing of locations and tasks to not fully complete are beginning to be a background focus to the rest of us. About 45 minutes we hear her call to us from the entry way, she informs she has to go to a bumfuck city in a different county and it's a little over an hour away. It's about 10 at night and she suddenly needs to go this fucking instant. Before anyone even has a chance to respond we hear the door shut and she's in her car. Uuuuuhhhhh. Okay. Right. Sure. What the fuck? 

Now I know this is a fatty wall of text, and I promise I'm sober as I'm writing this, but up in the beginning I used the phrase, ""astromical in occurance."" This is what I mean. The rest of us begin brainstorming/joking about why she would have to leave so suddenly and to that place. The daughter I know best says, ""maybe she found a spider when she was doing her shaking and didn't want to walk past it, so she turned around and went out the door."" I don't know what the hell that means so I ask for elaboration. It turns out when momma gets gacked she starts shaking people's jackets and shoes for fucking spiders. Not even kidding. She doesn't want any in the house and goes to extreme efforts to make sure it is that way. She shakes people's shoes for spiders. I fucking repeat, SHE SHAKES PEOPLE'S SHOES FOR SPIDERS. THAT'S WHERE MY GOD DAMN MONEY AND METH IS. My cash and my Meth is quite literally my lifeline, you can't fuck with that, but she took it all and dipped. I don't even know if I believe what I was told, maybe she knew I had something in my shoe, I don't know, but my god what an unlikely misfortune. Like are you fucking kidding me with that. Yes, it all should have been on my person, that's on me, but this consequence is just overkill. Lesson learned I suppose. She actually has yet to come back to town is what I've been told. I've driven by a few times and her car is never there. 

So yeah there's the spider story. For those who were present for the conversation in which this story was requested, I'm happy to share that my Favorite Lesbian Tweaker Duo is in fact together again, they just needed an adjustment of living arrangement. Which they got. 3 times in one day actually, I didn't help unpack at the new living quarters at the end of the day because at that point it was just excessive.",1515092742.0

These aren't days in a row, but just different days.) 

Day 1: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 8 hours, take five 5mg Hydro. Feel nothing. I assume I didn't wait long enough. 

Day 2 AND 3: Take Kratom at 9am, but instead wait 10 hours. Take five 5mg hydro's. Works perfectly. 

Day 4: Take Kratom at 9am, wait 9 hours, take two and a half 10mg hydro's, feel nothing.

Day 5: Same thing as Day 4. 

So clearly there is SOME antagonist effect of Kratom, but what exactly can I do tonight if I am planning on using the same dose of Hydrocodone, but I took Kratom this morning? Should I wait longer? Is there anything I can do to clear out the antagonists and lower my tolerance? (Magnesium, tumeric, tagament, etc.) 

Should I add a potentiater to the hydrocodone? Should I try crushing up the 10mg hydro's? Should I try fasting before taking the hydro? 

I realize Kratom has antagonists, but as you can see on Day 2 and 3 the hydro worked fine and I took the kratom in the morning, but I took 5mg tablets instead of 10mg ones. So could that have something to do with it? 

Is there ANYTHING I can do to get rid of the Kratom in my system for when I plan to take my hydro tonight?

I went on this big oxy binge last year in like october-november, for like almost 30 days i bought at least one Roxi 30 and just straight ate it no snorting no bullshit. but towards the end i’d buy like 2 cause one was still getting me high but not high enough. and towards the very very end i’d buy half an OP 80 just to not be sick for the whole day which would also somehow get me high. at this point i had final projects and shit so i wasn’t too worried about catching big nods and stuff like that cause i had shit to do also. 

But at the end the roxi man ran out and i literally had to stop cold turkey against my will. So for like 4 days i kept throwing up bile (i’m assuming it’s bile or stomach acid it was yellow) and i was dry heaving like a motherfucker nonstop. Also i felt like it would never stop. I had cold sweats and I would be hot and cold at the same time.

Thankfully my girl took care of me or i might have tried to jump out my window but this shit was so fucking painful. There was like a long rectangle down the front of my stomach that also would not stop hurting and i could barely stop breathing fast and shallow the whole time, it felt like i could never catch my breath. When i went to take a shit it was damn near liquid each time. I couldn’t even keep down water and I didn’t feel like eating shit. but the MOST confusing part is that I didn’t think eating a roxi would fix anything, if anything i thought i’d probably yak that up too. 

So my question to you fellas is, how the fuck do i know this was withdrawals or not? Was that just some fucking Flu? Have I still not experienced withdrawals? What the fuck could possibly be worse than that? Just give it to me straight , doc.. 

Naw fr tho that was fucking tough but I can rest 100x easier knowing that that’s what withdrawals are and that I’ve already experienced them. Cause i’m the type of dude who if he does it once, he can do it again and if that’s all they are then might as well go OD as fuck on the oxy’s next semester lol. ",1515090053.0

I know over the past year I’ve been on and off posting harm reduction questions that concerned a lot of you. I just wanted to start this by saying I’m tapering down on Bupe to hopefully leave me 4 year stint of On and off opioid abuse behind me.

THAT BEING SAID (here comes the concerning question) I’ve been in Italy with my family for the past few weeks visiting extended family. About a week into the trip my anxiety can back in full swing and began spiraling out of control. So basically I’ve been taking low dose (.1-.5) of benzo (lorazepam). 


[skip to here]
Today I found a small piece of a quarter bar and took it with my subutex. That was about 3 hours ago. Now I’m in a van with my family and I’m feeling like I’m hyperventilating, getting light headed, my breaths are shorter, and of course, panic attacks. Is it possibly with someone with a high tolerance to subs (10mg for 4 months, 8mg for 6 month’s daily) could get respiratory depression from adding that low of a dose of Xanax? I also did smoke a few cigarettes before getting in the van so that might have something to do with it. 

Basically I’m wondering if there’s a good way to monitor my respiration. I don’t want to make my family pull off and go to a hospital if it isn’t 100% necessary. Thank you guys, hope everything’s well.

Fucked off and got a felony, along with losing my license, and now I'm 37, nothing to my name, living with my homie and his mama, in life stasis.  This life is typical Norman Rockwell routine and it drives me fn nuts!

I do roofing, but work is slow and oxy is above $1mg, so I never get to satisfy my drug urges.  I see this whole fentanyl issue and know that even if i found dope, I'd be scared to try it, plus I hope I wouldn't put my family thru dope issues.

What's the general consensus on how long? Almost 40, decent shape. Only use benzos for these situations (withdrawal)

But fuck has my tolerance shot up quick. If I take my last dose tomorrow and stop cold turkey, I should be good right

I wouldn't say its bad, its just very noticeable to the point where I have to actually remember to take breaths that are not shallow. I tried to sleep the other night at the tail end of a 15mg dose and was struggling to get enough air to be comfortable in bed. So this made me mildly paranoid so I got up and did some stuff until my breathing was back to normal.

But is this normal though? From what I've read people don't get super shallow breathing until they're in the 20 mg's or 30's, but I do suppose everyone's body reacts to opiates differently. Just wanted to know if there are any methods to reducing or eliminating respiratory depression. It's not that I'm super concerned about it with the doses I'm doing, it just honestly gets pretty annoying after a while and would definitely prefer not to deal with it if possible.

So I was feeling especially self-destructive and decided that it would be a good idea to do a whole gram of decent ECP in an evening. I insufflate, so it was spread out over a couple of hours as that is quite a lot of powder to get up in me. My tolerance is pretty shot, so it takes me quite a lot to feel anything beyond getting well, and it's a delicate thing where it's hard for me to not overshoot the sweet spot of euphoria and just nod the fuck out. Needless to say, I did just that this evening. 

For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to do the dishes. I start running the water, waiting for it to heat up before I fill the sink, and that's when I nod into total oblivion. Unfortunately, there was a cereal bowl in the sink completely covering the drain. I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

I have no idea how long I was out, but I wake up (still standing right in front of the sink like a fucking retard) to a sink full of water running like a waterfall off the countertop. As I start to come to, I realize that there's about a half inch of water on the kitchen floor. I live in a one bedroom apartment, so I realize that I have flooded almost the whole living area too. 

I freak. the. fuck. out. 

Start running around grabbing every towel in the house. I get down on the floor using towels like squeegees, just trying to corral all the water into the kitchen, where it's tiled instead of the parquet flooring in the living area. I line up towels like dykes at the two doors of the kitchen. As I start getting the water off the floor and wringing towels out into the sink, I realize that all the cutlery and kitchen tool drawers have filled up with water completely. I'm absolutely hysterical at this point. I have to empty the drawers of their contents, bail some water out so I can get them off their tracks without dumping litres more water on the floor. I think I dropped a bunch of cutlery, which woke up my (sober) girlfriend. She was not impressed. I told her I started filling the sink and then fell asleep on the toilet. She would kill me if she knew I was standing right there the whole time nodded out. 

It took me over an hour to get all the water off the floor. Then I had to wash everything that was in all the drawers, hang up all the towels, and run them through the laundry the next day. The wooden drawers have swollen considerably, so they're insanely stiff now. I feel like such a fucking pathetic piece of shit, I swear I almost jumped off my balcony when I realized what I had done. 

The one silver lining, that I honestly can not fucking believe, is that it seems that I didn't flood my downstairs neighbour's apartment. I simply do not understand how that didn't happen. There was water running for at least an hour (no idea how long exactly, this happened in the middle of the night too) on the tile and parquet floor, I thought FOR SURE I was going to be completely fucked when my neighbour / management realized what happened. I guess it's possible that they are away for the holidays and I'm going to get a rude awakening in a few days when they get back, but so far so good. It would have been hard to deny any wrongdoing if maintenance knocked on my door at 8am the next morning to see a thousand soaked towels hanging to dry all over the apartment. Now the only evidence is my stiff, swollen drawers. 

Holy shit, do I ever feel fucking terrible. I've fucked up a lot in the last 3-4 years that I've been an addict, but this is big. I'm barely affording life right now (not just due to use, getting fucked over for hours at my work since it's the winter), so if I were to get slapped with a few grand of damages to the apartment building I'd probably just off myself.

Since I started using Kratom twice a day, I have found that whenever I use hydrocodone, I can not feel the hyrocodone. 

I assumed this was because Kratom obviously raises tolerance with an agonist effect, but further reading came across a big debate on whether or not it also had an antagonist effect. This intrigued me, so I did a test... Well, a few. Here they are! These are not consecutive days, and I hope someone finds this info useful.

Please note: in all these days I drank a lot of water with the Kratom and Opiates, ALWAYS do this. Never forget to drink water. I also drank a coke with the DOC on Day 2 and 5, so that may have something to do with it! 

Day 1: I took 4 grams of Red Bali at 10am and waited until 7pm that day, and took 25mg of Hydrocodone. I felt NOTHING. I still assumed it was my tolerance. 

Day 2: I took 4 grams of Red Bali at this time 8am and waited until 7pm again, this time, not eating after 3 oclock until 7pm, and taking magnesium oxide twice that day, as long as vitamin C. I took 25mg of hydrocodone, and BOOM! IT WORKED! Not very much, but it worked. 

Day 3: I woke up late this day, so I had to take Kratom at 11am. 6 grams this time due to a very bad headache. I took magnesium, did not eat after 3, and also took vitamin C, but strangely enough I did not feel a thing... 

Day 4: It was about the same thing as Day 3. Except this time, I added 2 grams of maeng da, and I took the Kratom at 10am thinking if I left at least 9 hours, it should have an effect. I took the magnesium, vitamin C, but again felt absolutely nothing. 

Day 5: This time I decided to push the Kratom earlier, and took Kratom at 7am. I took magnesium, vitamin C, and didn't eat after 3. At 7pm (well, actually, this is tonight!) I took, again, 25 mg of hydrocodone, and felt it perfectly!!!

These weren't consecutive days, and I'm sure the kratom and hydrocodone would work TOGETHER, but if this is useful to anyone, I definitely found that once the Kratom (Red Bali) wears off, there is still a bit of an antagonist effect until around 10-12 hours after you take it. I am not sure what causes this, and am not sure if it is like this for everyone... 

So what is your experience? I know there is a lot out there, but it's hard to find multiple days testing like this. So if you are wondering why you can't feel your DOC after 9 hours, try waiting 2 more hours!! That might help :) 

Peace and be safe

I wanted to find out what it feels like to be a *real* junkie.  Being a long time denizen of this sub, I think I know how to do it, in theory.  

Anyway, I microwaved 1 mL of water to boiling and dissolved half a strip of suboxone in 0.4 mL.  After everything dissolved, I slapped my arm until the vein (cephalic vein?) popped up.  Stab one: damn it hurts!  Pushed and pulled the needle but couldn't register no matter what.  A tiny drop of blood appeared after I withdrew.  After waiting for the bleeding to stop, stab two.  Ouch.  But this time, I felt a 'pop' after pushing the needle in about 1/4 of an inch, and bingo!  I pulled back and blood filled the barrel and mixed with the orangey color of the suboxone.  I pushed the plunger down -- no resistance.  I withdrew the needle and blood immediately started gushing out.  Made a mess on my pants, oh well.

I started feeling lightheaded and opiatey pretty fast (within a minute), but it was underwhelming.  Totally not worth stabbing myself twice for.  I now have more respect for nurses who do without making it hurt so much.  Does it ever get better with time/experience?

In April 2017 I ordered 2g furanylfentanyl from darknetmarkets. I received 2g of furanylfentanyl and 2g of 1:10 furanylfentanyl:manitol  (not sure why the vendor added the diluted furanylfentanyl).

I had a two suicide attempts, which made me black out for 3-4 hours, but breathing didn't stop.  But I knew I needed to push myself more to get it done. So I decided to myself addicted to ""corner myself"" so that suicide was only option.

I got addicted after 18 days starting in October (at first I used just once a day, then twice...peaking maybe at 8 times a day). After those 18 days I woke up with first major withdrawal, all burning up and feeling thousands of needles pinching everywhere. Tried to OD several times, with largest dose of >= 500 mg furanylfentanyl orally (estimated 10-30x fatal dose based on LD_50 of chimpanzes) + I snorted bunch to go with that. Every time I OD'd I blacked out for 3-4 hours, but breathing never stopped.

The only really unexpected thing was something I experienced in the major withdrawals twice - I'd call it **""god's light""** (I'm not religious by the way, but I had ""god delusions"" before because of my paranoid schizphrenia + bipolar disorder). First it appeared after those 18 days when first major withdrawal appeared. It ""told"" me that the suicide won't work. By ""told"" I mean a thought appeared in mind that I knew it was true. But I thought that those were just those god delusions (not sure what it actually was but fact is that I couldn't die).

Second time it appeared when I started the get-clean withdrawal. It lasted maybe for 8 hours. Everything was immensely white and colorful and beautiful, I could hear every molecule of water boiling in kettle...all while in staggering pain and feeling that holes were forming in my bones.

I've had all kinds of psychedelics many times before (LSD, MDMA, psilocybin, salvia divinorum, ...) but I never before saw anything like that. It was like really strong really painful trip. It was actually kind of fun while it lasted despite the pain. After the ""god's light"" subsided, it was just pain (+ all the other symptoms like diarrhea, throwing up/dry heaving until I couldn't breathe, sweating...). I tried to sleep which was a mistake because instead of sleep my thoughts got twisted and lost. I tried to fight it for several hours, but it broke me.

Then I sent a friend to a doctor with whom I made an arrangement before that he'd prescribe suboxone. It took 3 hours for him to get there and back, which was like half an eternity. Then, as I said, it took the 8 mg suboxone 12 hours to work. After 3 hours I was at least in a little bit less pain. But before that if I had any opiate (even heroin) I'd do it just to stop the pain.

After another 8 hours the suboxone slowly wore off and I was again in full withdrawal. This time I noticed that if I was talking or doing anything and was fully focused on it, the pain was brutal, but I could hold it on a level that was manageable. So for the next 30 hours I was doing anything to keep occupied (reading, writing journal, watching videos, sorting old memories). I was astonished how many things from over 20 years ago I could remember.

That was the worst phase, then it took a few more days of shitting water and some vertigo (but the world was spinning so fast...). At least I lost some weight :)",1515196324.0

Shit went south when I overcame my needle phobia and I OD'd twice on dope/benzos in 2016 as well as a coke overdose-almost-stroke type deal in early 2017.

Well I reached my breaking point this summer. I went to detox and inpatient rehab later. I'm currently in a sober living facility which is going pretty well, I've also found a satisfactory career. It gives me something to which I can work towards.

As of today, I've been completely sober for six months (not counting detox because I was on a taper). I wish y'all the best of luck. I don't wanna sound like a hallmark card but it doesn't have to be like this, this strung out shit is for the birds. Sober live has a lot to offer once you brave the first few weeks and even after the pink cloud comes crashing down.

For example I got money for random stuff now! I splurged on PC parts and I'm currently saving up for a flight to the US to visit my friends over there. It feels good to be independent, I no longer am at my dealer's mercy nor do I have to panhandle/shoplift/resort to other grimy shit.

Anyone looking to get clean, here's what I've observed:

- Don't overwhelm yourself. There's no need to become swole, fuck Emma Roberts, read Joyce and Pynchon and Heidegger, found your own religion, or do any other outrageous stuff within one week of achieving sobriety. Set small, attainable goals and work towards them. This is easier said than done and if you feel depression is encroaching upon your problem-solving abilities, see a psychiatrist.

- Reward yourself. Shooting dope is Russian Roulette, especially nowadays, and you made it out! So do stuff that is fun to you and feel out different hobbies.

- Surround yourself with others willing to stay sober or normoids. This is essential, because loneliness often leads to boredom which leads to intrusive thoughts which leads to relapse. That was my experience during previous attempts at sobriety. I use every chance I get to socialize, support groups, therapists, work outings, etc. If you have to force yourself to do that stuff, DO IT!

I didn't want to sound like a Hallmark Card, but at the end sobriety is all about having some greater goal that you value more than Heroin. So stumble through the world wide-eyed like a kid, find your calling and put the plan in motion. If I can get sober, literally everyone can.

Best of luck to y'all, sober or not!",1515194717.0

So I’ve always been a lurker since I discovered this community of people supporting each other. So I had been smoking weed for ibs for a long time pretty much all day. When I don’t smoke I throw up and have cramps. One day I found kratom and it was like I didn’t have ibs anymore. It allowed me to take a t break for a drug test which would have been impossible without it. But I never stopped taking it when I started smoking again. Now I’m just spending too much money and kratom is potentially going to become a banned substance while weed is on its way legal in my state so I’m quitting. I was dosing WAY too often. Pretty much every two hours. I want to say I hope you guys don’t think I think this is as severe as withdrawing  from a serious opiate habit but combined with the return of my ibs and general anxiety (I have general anxiety disorder) symptoms I think it’s gonna be bad. If I don’t dose after 2 hours I get cravings and start to get cramps and anxiety. 

I haven’t taken it for 6 hours now and I can feel diarrhea happening and I’m getting really annoying restless legs. I’m basically just smoking a ton of weed but I also have gabapentin prescribed (for the anxiety disorder). Does anyone know how much of this I can safely take in a night? I’m not trying to get high but I want to hit the restless legs if I can. Any help is appreciated sorry if this is a mess. I have a very frantic feeling haha 

I respect all of you so much and I always have but I now even more so. I can’t imagine what really bad withdrawals feel like. I know mine will get worse but even so I can’t imagine this is all people who have bad opiate habits feel.

Long story short, I stole a pricey tablet convertible from work. It was actually a defective unit that is supposed to be sent back to the manufacturer but I thought what a shame if it's easily repairable at home, which it is.

The first day I felt a little paranoid but day two my heart was racing before bed.

&nbsp;

Now I don't even need the deice. I don't plan on selling it. Perhaps I'd buy something just like it if I didn't have so little excess cash to be spent on such things. Hard to save money when getting material for Cliffposts :p

&nbsp;

So I took it home because other people disappear with shit like this, why can't I? Aside from paranoia from repercussions of my actions if caught there is one more concern.

My immediate supervisors put up with my shit because I'm a good worker who comes in for my scheduled shifts. They mainly tolerate my frequent late arrivals for my shifts.

&nbsp;

My logic is that if my supervisors put up with me and haven't fired me yet.. I shouldn't pay them back by creating issues for them. Once this device is noticed to be missing it's a $900+ hit for the department. 

It could jeopardize my supervisor's job or advancement. They don't deserve that... **I think I've made my decision while writing this. I'm bringing it back once and for all tonight.**

At the beginning of the post I wasn't certain and was fishing for advice and recommendations. Maybe looking for someone to compel me to just keep it. One person might say ""you already have it in your home"" but that fact does not mean that my supervisors wont get hell for it.

I really need the money but if I take the job I lose my Medicaid and won't be able to see the doctor. But if I take the job I can buy kratom and maybe opiates if I decide to travel down that road again. 

I got to figure this shit out do I worry about paying the electric bill and buying kratom/dope, or do I continue trying to fix my health. The logical answers my health but if I don't get this 600$ + light bill payed I'm going to freeze to death any way. I don't know.

I've been trying to quit and peak of wd I gave up because I suck. I pull together every bit of money I have to cop and then go to the pharmacy for syringes because I threw mine out because I thought I wouldn't need them anymore. The pharmacy I go to is downtown and always busy but I go because they never hassle me about buying needles.

I wait in a long line and it's when it's finally my turn my card gets declined. I have change in my pocket that's probably enough and the guy checking me out said its fine. The person in line behind me says something like ""some of us need to be here"". She might be right maybe they're picking up medicine for their sick kids at home. I feel like an asshole holding up the line so I tell her I'm sorry I'm almost done. She rolls her eyes and as I count my change I can hear her and the other person in line talking shit about me. I buy my syringes with pocket change and go to walk away and as I do the first women behind me tells me ""Kill yourself junkie"".

I don't let that crap get to me but I was in the stage of wd where everything makes you cry and disappointed in myself for giving up and that statement shattered me. I can't get it out of my head maybe I should've killed myself but I don't know why a stranger who knows nothing about me other then I was buying syringes want to tell me that.

Anyway, as all shitty stories start out “...so I met this guy....” and it’s true. Started talking to someone on here and fell for him like I’ve never experienced before... through an (old) marriage and plenty of other stuff... never has been like this. He claimed the same on his end. 

Anyway, as of a few months ago I was a half intelligent person working and finishing my training in medicine and parenting my kids and just living. Then I started having trouble with an infection in the hardware in my leg from an old injury. Got seriously ill and septic and ended up hospitalized a bunch. Odd being constantly on the other end of treatment . Here’s where the story goes bad...

I left the hospital against medical advice because I had to move... was going to return to the hospital that night but I just had some stuff to take care of that couldn’t wait. Good plan and all but like 2 hrs after leaving the hospital I got arrested on a bench warrant for missing court (for being in the hospital and they didn’t send the notice until after I was already hospitalized so I don’t know). Anyway long story short the judge was a dick and decided to make an example of me and threw me in jail. I remained there for two months trying to straighten it all out. While there I had no way to contact ANYONE except my ex husband since I had to know peoples numbers by memory and I don’t memorize anyone’s numbers anymore. So I had literally no way to contact him. 

I spent the entire 64 days freaking out because I know he was assuming I was dead since the last I spoke to him I was sooo sick. If there would have been any way to get a message to him I would have. I don’t know if all jails are like my county but there were zero options. I was beyond sad, worried, anxious... there isn’t even a word to describe it. Longest 64 days of my life... not because I was in jail but because I couldn’t contact him. 

Upon release literally the first thing I did... before I even had a chance to talk to my kids, etc, I reached out to him. Explained (or attempted to) the situation.  No response for a few days. Made me feel like an ass since those few days were torture and I know I put him thru that for two months. Finally he responded and basically told me to fuck off because I put him through hell in the time I was gone and I should have contacted him. Ouch, but I get it I guess. Several days later we talked and it was actually pretty good again, and then he just stopped responding. Clearly making a point, I get that. 

So here I am, like a dick head, still wishing every time I get a text that it will be him. It never is. Obviously he’s telling me he’s moved on and so should I but ITS NOT THAT EASY! I understand that I hurt him but I feel like I deserve maybe a little understanding that there was NOTHING I could do and that I’m equally as hurt. 

I guess I need to just forget about the time we had that was perfect, but it’s difficult considering I wasn’t looking for a relationship (nor was he) but we kind of just ended up that way. I would do virtually anything (beyond stupid stuff like harming my kids) for him. Ugh. Help, someone say something to make me feel better (but nothing anti-him because a) he doesn’t deserve it; b) he will possibly read this at some point.)

My question is, have any of you ever had that weird idea, imaging that you go in and sit down and have a big meal, leaving you with no money and the inability to get something for a high? And now you're withdrawing while full on greasy food.

I was snorting for a year before that. I'm not an every day user, and sometimes I will go months without using (by choice). I don't even think about it every day.

As much as I love getting high, I just can't deal with withdrawal. From what I understand I only go through very light withdrawals no hurting bones, no RLS, very little sickness, but BAD depression with suicidal thoughts to the point where I isolate myself for days and stop all communication with anyone I know or care about. The solution would be to just stay high, but I refuse to become a full time every day user. That is definitely not what I want.

I don't even really know where I am going with this post, but I guess this is me admitting I have a bit of a problem. If I can't stop those impulses, that is a problem. Isolating myself from loved ones for days every couple of weeks is a problem. Having suicidal thoughts is a problem.

I've been using heroin for 7 years now. Switching between suboxone for a majority of time time, and only being being sober for about six months max a couple time before eventually relapsing.

I've been using for a while again now and after taking my last dose I got bored and decided to clean up some videos on my phone that were taking up storage space. I came across something I hadn't known existed. It was video I had made of myself, to myself. I must have made it while at the end of a bad binge. I was telling myself to not continue this lifestyle, while seeing a sadness I've never seen in myself before, about how this just wasn't worth it. I didn't watch more than 15 seconds into it before I stopped it. I sat and thought about things for awhile. 

For the first time I think I am starting to grasp onto the fact that it's not worth the binges anymore. I know the pain at the end but I seem to block it out before starting another. I obviously knew they were bad, but now I feel as though I need to take a more serious approach. I know I can do it. I've never doubted I was an addict and that I will always be one whether I'm using or clean. I just want to change my ways with a little help from people like myself. I know I can do it on my own, as in without rehab, and by talking to people on here. 

I have suboxone and xanax to help me get through this like usual, which is why I seem to repress the negative outcomes of prior binges, but depression plays a major role into my relapses. I just get bored I guess. What makes it hard for me to understand is that I had a normal childhood and I am in a good situation right now, have a good job, and a loving and supportive family. This just makes it harder for me to understand where my negative thoughts come from. I feel as though it makes it harder for me to grasp onto. Knowing that there is no obvious reason for the way I feel. 

Kratom isn't something I'm interested because I can and have detoxed myself many times to complete sobriety by tapering so the getting clean part isn't an issue for me. The issue is staying clean and refrain from taking that wrong step that eventually leads another relapse. 

You know how you can't help someone unless they are ready to be helped? Well I feel now is a time for me to take a shot at it. I am very independent so meetings and stuff like that are not for me. So while appreciated please don't suggest that. I am only looking for answers to my question. I'm just giving a bit of background for those who care to read, and can relate.

I know replacing one thing for another isn't a good idea, but I've got nothing to lose. No matter how many times it takes I'll eventually find a way out. I am just looking for some experiences and suggestions from others who may have been helped by my questions below, or have some insight on what may have helped them. 

****NO SOURCING****

*So here is my question*

I've heard ketamine and other disassociatevs have helpes others with withdrawal and depression or similar symptoms. I know there are different types or chemicals similar to them so I am curious which ones should I look into? I do not know a whole lot about them other than what I've read about positive experiences from people who are in similar situations as myself. If there are other recommendations of drugs that are different from the ones mentioned above that help in the same way I'd love to take a look into those as well.

Basically everything someone could do wrong I did and I OD’ed. I started throwing up, sweating buckets, falling in and out of consciousness, and my entire body itched intensely. I’m lucky to be alive considering I didn’t go to the hospital, I just passed out, woke up the next morning and went to work like nothing happened.

Anyway, I feel incredibly stupid and guilty. I have a whole new appreciation for everything I have, for my family. I almost destroyed their lives after one reckless and stupid night. I’m definitely done with opiates for ever. I’m especially afraid of how my father would react seeing as he himself is an ex heroin addict.

 I only have this on my mind because my girl and I are not living together and the place she is staying at a woman recently died of an ""accidental overdose"". Of course if something were to happen at that residence again they'd start sniffing around and I'd end up killing dude, but it get's me worried knowing that she maybe living with some nut job.  

Dude is already careless letting someone pass away his home, but now I just have this gnawing itch in the back of my mind as to just tell my girl I love her everyday.  She got no job and this dude is supporting her and I know it get's to the point she has to pan handle to shut the dude up for a day or two. 

I know she ain't fucking dude cause he anti-depressants totally killed her libido along with the 130mg methadone, plus she is 40+.  I feel like that guy is going to want he to open her legs soon because she is already pan handling to shut him up.  Anyway. This is out of my hands and just got MY gears turning as to how many people have flew under the radar as murderers and killed people with overdoses.  

Ok, I call her my girl as we are recently split and I kind of fucked things up by being a baby and shit accusing her of shit she ain't doing and going from living with someone 24/7 to nothing now and coming back to r/opiates cause of my ever growing loneliness.

I actually have tramadol 50.mg/paracetamol 500mg. The highest dose I've ever took was  700mg of tramadol (taken during a night between 10pm and 4am) but I've read that the maximum dose anyone can prescribe you is 400mg per day because otherwise it's very dangerous, is it because of the paracetamol ? Is it only dangerous in the long term ?
And one last question, well... 2 last questions, I'm almost sure snorting tramadol is useless but is it morphine ? If you put tramadol powder in a cigarette paper ( for rolling, sorry for my bad English) and just swallow It, does it works? And with morphine?

Yes, neither Travs or chasing-d0pamine are on the mod team anymore, but they are both quite alright, they just have a lot going on in their personal lives right now. We were hoping that they would have been able to come on here and say something themselves, but understandably reddit takes a backseat to real life. 

I am not going to go into personal details as to what is going on, so do not bother to ask. I will say that I have spoken to both of them in the last 24 hours on the phone and they are both doing just fine. Sometimes we just have to take a step back and get our priorities in order and catch our breath.

I know that a lot of people here have gotten pretty close with both Travs and/or chasing-d0pamine, and if you do know what is going on in their personal lives I ask that you keep it private. I know I wouldn't want someone putting my life on blast in a public forum. Thank you ahead of time for everyone's cooperation in this matter.

I have been a opiate user since I was 17, my first opiate experience was snorting an og oc60 back in 2007, it resulted in me puking my brains out and feeling better than any human should feel followed by a heavy nod, I was immediately in love. My father is a cpp, and taught me about snorting those little red beauties as well as giving me my first pill. I wasn't a full blown addict until I was around 22 years old and shortly after OPs came out. I then told my dad about opana (the stop signs at the time) so he switched to them from the shitty OPs. I am and always have been a very high functioning addict working for one of the largest retail auto parts stores in the United states my entire adult life. Fast forward to 2018 and I'm still working in the retail auto parts business in the geographic center of the United States. I started dabbling in BTH roughly 6 months ago which scares me but what can you do, it's the progression of this disease most of us share in this community. I did start MMT 3 days ago as I am trying to better myself and get somewhat of a grip on my addiction. Worst case scenario it merely gives me a nice tolerance break.

Sorry for the wall of text.

TLDR; I am a long time lurker, and decided to become an active member of this community and introduce myself and say hello.",1515278678.0

It seems like on every single post where someone is expressing their woes over being broke and in crippling withdrawal, someone will chirp up with ""get some kratom brah.""

For all you people, I would like to tell you that kratom is not a wonder-cure for anyone and everyone who has an opiate addiction.  Putting aside the fact that many of the people I have seen who talk about what a miracle drug kratom is are either addicted to hydros or oxy (no hate for non-dope users, but fact is it's a much weaker substance), for some people, myself being one of them, kratom does precisely fuck-all.

I have tried 4 or 5 different strains of kratom, so all you people who are thinking of piping up and telling me that I ""just need to find the right strain"" can settle down.  Putting aside the fact that it's kinda ridiculous to expect people to buy and try 5 or 6 different strains if kratom searching for the right one, it just does nothing for some people.  Last time I had gone 24 hours without using, I parachuted 3g, 2g, 3g, and 2g of kratom in 15 minute intervals.  I experienced literally zero relief from my withdrawal symptoms.  I don't know how some of you people actually manage to take an ounce of this shit every day, but even tabling that issue, all the people talking about the wonders of kratom need to understand there are some people for whom it provides zero relief.  I see people recommending that guys in withdrawal spend the last of their cash on a couple ounces of kratom, and this is a terrible idea.

For all you people who can experience relief from ingesting an ounce of that vile plant, I congratulate you.  For me, it's plain gross and it doesn't do anything.  Period.",1515268852.0

There's no such thing as careful.,"She's got 3 boys and she was all they had. Their Dad wasn't any help, not lately anyway. He relapsed hardcore after he had to bury his oldest son a few months back. He's been numbing the pain with heroin. Not working, not even leaving the house. Not caring about anything but 'getting well'. 

See, most of the young people around here overdose and die. His son's death was the other side of the coin. He was shot and killed, they took his money and dope. He was 25. 

So she fought everyday to stay clean. Because the boys needed her and she needed them. I was so proud of her. She was doing so good. Sure, she was overwhelmed and needed a break, a buzz. I begged her not to. I OD'd in July so I know first hand how easy it is...to die. To underestimate the drug, overestimate your tolerance. To think you're being careful as you beat on deaths door. I've never been so grateful for modern medicine. BC of Narcan, I'm still here to tell my story. And the stories of those that aren't so fortunate. I hope that one day her boys realize how strong their mom was. 

That's how the story could've gone. It could have easily been the end of hers. Thank God they didn't have any rigs. Or her 6th month old would've cried out to deaf and dead ears. Like a surprising number of infants have done. 

There's a reason she didn't have a rig. There's a reason that the baby cried and somehow her BF came to. 

There's a reason they brought her back. Whatever that may be, I'm so glad that she called me. And not her mom. ",1515268050.0

Of course I couldn't wait until I got there. So I went to a restaurant a asked if I could use the restroom. It wasn't a minute since I locked the door when it knocked the first time. At first I played dead, took a shit and started prepping my shot. 



Then it knocked again. I yelled that I had cramps and needed another minute. Still, there was a woman outside rambling that one shouldn't block the restroom for that long. Luckily there were a huge party of girls, celebrating a birthday or something that argued in my favor.




I was so afraid that an employee would show up to open the door forcibly. Already my mind played out how they would open the door to me sitting on the capper, pants down, actually crapping and a needle in my bruised and swollen arm. It would've been the end of me.




When the lady resorted to knocking and lamenting even harder, I finished up whilst assuring I was coming out as loudly as possible. End of story was that she found it too smelly anyways and left. Imagine it hadn't been smelling legit like shit! The girls were super nice and do you know that, when someone gives you attention and you're stressed out you just start crying? When they assured me that she was the crazy one and that it was perfectly okay to take your time to poop, I was just done. Damn, that was close. What if those girls hadn't been there and that crazy bitch would've had the door opened? My heart is still beating like a mf... (could be the coke tho).

Hadn't used Oxy for two months (or any opiate). Took 80mg on each of Thursday and Friday and nothing since. Felt ok Saturday, tired but nothing worse. Sunday and today I have severe anxiety and depression. No real physical symptoms.

Could it be withdrawals just from two days use? Or just an 'oxy hangover' or dopamine depletion?

Have no access to Oxy now and even if I did I wouldn't take it. I've had this depression/anxiety before after binges but they were normally 4/5 day and I'd be doing coke as well. Didn't expect to feel this bad after two days use. 

This doesn't feel very 'usual'. Really hope I feel a bit better by tomorrow. Am using benzos to keep the edge off but don't want to push that much beyond 3 days so am going to try to go back to running tomorrow.

I don't think I can use opiates at ALL in the future, not even 1/2 days every couple of months. They made me feel pretty good but honestly nowhere near worth what I'm experiencing now. ",1515416410.0

Just people trying to live, and being radically honest about where they're at.

I love the compassion I see here. I love the lack of judgment. The support.

Maybe I'm trying to understand how I lost her. I don't know.

We all did the same shit, we all got sent away to rehab, we all kept going. Sure, we'd stop every now and again for a couple weeks, maybe a month. We'd always relapse. We'd relapse every fucking time. We all lost our old friends and found each other. It was beautiful in a way, we lost our old friends and found people that understood each other. Maybe they didn't understand though, maybe all they wanted was another fucking hit for free.

At some point the hits stopped coming for free. The love stopped coming at that point too. We all seemed to have a really good ability to make the wrong decisions at the worst times. When did everything become so shitty? When did we stop getting high and start getting just ok? Why the fuck did this happen to us?

We were good kids, but at some point people stopped seeing that in us and we stopped seeing it in ourselves. We were worthless. We weren't going anywhere other than the streets for another bag. When the fuck did we start lying? I mean, we always lied to our parents but why the fuck did we start lying to each other? We were embarrassed about what we were doing with people that were doing the exact same shit.

We all started stealing money from each other. We all started stealing anything from each other. When the fuck did we pick up needles? None of it made sense.

1. Is there the same dangers as opiates with cutting and mixing other drugs (like fent for us)? Or are most of the edibles legit and safe

2. Is there a lot of risk? Are LEO focused on the edible weed market as much as opiates

3. How's the experience? I could buy weed, easy in the greater philly area, but too lazy to figure out how to make the shit. Do they actually work?

So I'm debating the dnm to buy some so I have something to chill on when I'm not popping oxy.

This relapse lasted about 5 months. Just enough time that a full 8mg of suboxone strip isnt enough to feel normal.

Now, I had this international flight booked and I figured I'd induct onto suboxone during the flight because although subs dont make you feel 100%, the state they put you in isnt too horrible. Being on an airplane with no access to my dealer will force me to commit to the induction.

Also, I had read about this method of inducting where you take suboxone and then you use your DOC, and 24 hrs later you take more subs and do more of your DOC as needed until you gradually build up bupe in your receptors. This being the case, I took 4mg of suboxone, smoked some tar on top, and hopped on the plane.

While i was in the air, i started to feel antsy. It had been about 12 hours since my last sesh and I already had a bunch of bupe in me already, so i dosed 1mg of suboxone.

Fatal mistake. I suddenly started to feel a cold sweat and my heart started to pound. Ive felt this feeling before. This is precipitated withdrawal onset. The last time i felt this, i woke up my friend early on the AM and gunned past red lights to borrow some tar from him to get well. PSA: This actually works. They say nothing can take you out of precipitated withdrawals, but doing your DOC actually takes you out. Although, I hadnt taken a large dose. I never take more than 1-2mg of suboxone at a time for just that reason.

Anyway, so im in the air, and the withdrawal symptoms start kicking in, and theres still 2 hours left in my flight. And then a 1 hour layover. And then another 6 hour fucking flight.

Theres actually not much to say about what happened next, because i was just in excruciating withdrawal for 8 hours, while in a cramped seated position, on a latin american airplane. Just kicked like a fish nonstop. Nausea but no vomitting, so i wasnt as bad as i could have been. Extreme thirst, but every sip of water made me nauseous. Bowels fuckin throbbing. Cant fuckin get comfortable. Wanted to lay down so bad but had to remain in a seated position. Every second of every minute went by so slowly. I thought I would never fuckin end. I was praying for the plane to crash. Wanted to stand up and shout ""does anyone have any fucking opiate on them please god?""

It was such a desperate helpless position to be in. Took so much out of me.

Waited as long as i could and continued taking more and more .5-1mg doses of sub but the sickness wouldnt go away. Pure torture.

I cant believe some of you go full blown cold turkey like that or kick in prison... infinite respect. I 1000% would have called my dealer and hooked if i could have. Fuck that shit.",1515392060.0

I played dumb and was like “what do you mean??” They responded with “you know what I mean!!”  Then they found a prescription for 100mcg fentanyl patches in my pocket that I hadn’t yet filled. So they start asking me if i have any on me. I told them I was wearing one. They started going off about how I must have chewed it (nope), and asking how many I had, not believing when I told them just the one and forced me to show them, at which point they ripped it off my body (illegally again). Grabbed my license and ran my name (fine, don’t care, but wtf). It was insane. The whole time I had a pump with iv dilaudid hooked up to my line which they didn’t even ask about haha.

Press Release

China announces scheduling controls on two fentanyl precursor chemicals
 

WASHINGTON – China’s Ministry of Public Security last week announced scheduling controls on two fentanyl precursor chemicals – NPP and 4ANPP, substances that can be used to make illicit drugs. The scheduling controls will take effect on February 1, 2018 and is the result of the ongoing collaboration between the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Government of China and their shared commitment to countering illicit fentanyl-class substances.

“Fentanyl compounds significantly contribute to the current opioid crisis in the United States.  By stemming the chemicals used to make these substances, this latest Chinese scheduling action will help save lives,” said DEA Acting Administrator Robert W. Patterson. “This scheduling action is an important step and a testament to the progress our countries are making together in addressing this epidemic.”

DEA and Chinese officials maintain frequent contact to collaborate and share data on the threat from fentanyl-class substances and their impact on the United States.  Information-sharing includes scientific data, trafficking trends, and sample exchanges. This dialogue has resulted in improved methods for identifying and submitting deadly substances for government control.

The Chinese Government previously controlled four fentanyl-class substances – carfentanil, furanyl fentanyl, valeryl fentanyl, and acryl fentanyl – which took effect on March 1, 2017, and another four new psychoactive substances/fentanyl-class substances - U-47700, MT-45, PMMA, and 4,4’ DMAR – which took effect on July 1, 2017.",1515367924.0

So the past two days have been kinda dry for me. Haven’t been able to come up on anything for a few days or get any cash for dope, up until last night. Last night out of the blue someone who owed me some cash paid me back and so I went and hit up my middle and told him I wanted to get a G. While on the way to meet the dboy with my middle, my middle calls him to make sure he’s got the same old fire dope he usually has and he confirms he does. After the wait of what seemed like forever, middle comes back and give me .8 of my g and he keeps the .2 for the meet. Well, at this point I’m pretty happy I’m gonna be well for a few days. So I decided I’d do just a little bigger shot than usual. I normally do a .1 shot, but last night I decided to do a .15-.2 shot to celebrate. After taking forever to hit like usual, I push down on old faithful and blast off to nodsville. I could tell instantly that I had done to much. At this point I was almost out of fuel so right after the shot I pulled from the parking lot I was in, to the gas station next to me. While driving over I told my middle I didn’t feel well and that I think I did to much. After parking at the gas pump I don’t remember a thing. My next memory is waking up in the back of an ambulance with an EMT telling me that he gave me narcan. I was so freaked out, this wasn’t supposed to happen to me right? This is shit only those crazy mofos on r/opiates post about right? Well I guessed wrong. When I get to the Er they start doing blood tests and shit, and next thing I know there is a state trooper beside me. He tells me that they charged me with a dui of drugs takes me to county after they release me from Er. Well I posted bond this morning from county and I’m still in shock about everything. I’m just not sure where I stand about it really. Part of me is telling me fuck heroin it almost killed me! But the other part wants to go right back and get more. I’m just at a loss for words really...

I always snorted my dope, and I remember there being SO many times where I was so physically sick that I would just set up shop and do a line in my car immediately after picking up. I had my own routine of doing my lines, and doing them in the car was never as good and easy as when I would do it at home; however, there were many times that it was totally necessary to do a line and get well before driving the 30 minute trek home. 

Now, my question for the shooters (and I’ve thought about this *so* many times but never knew anyone who did it to ask) - do you/have you ever done shots in the car immediately after picking up?

Before switching to Vivitrol I was on sub matinence for about a year. 

My last relapse was about 6 months ago, luckily it only lasted a couple weeks and I promptly got back on the shot. Long story short I’m currently at a crossroads. I really feel like the Vivitrol isn’t working for me. It’s not curbing my cravings and is also causing my depression and anxiety to worsen.

I’ve been thinking about asking my doctor to take me off of Vivitrol and to put me back on suboxone. Have any of you ever done this? While it seems like an ass-backwards decision, as most people would transition from subs to Vivitrol, I think i would be better off.

The question is would he will be willing to do this? While I feel like it’s totally my choice, the fact I’m opiate free might mean I can’t just go back on suboxone. I guess all I can do is ask but sadly I feel like the only way to switch would be to skip my apt, relapse then go back and ask for a sub induction.

I should be getting my hands on 50mg dihydrocodeine soon(I know it's not a lot) and was wondering if I should take it orally or rectally. I won't be getting more anytime soon so I want to make this one count.

I have no opioid tolerance so that shouldn't pose a problem, however, I have learned from past codeine and tramadol experiences that I am a poor metaboliser in regards to cyp2d6.

And lastly I was wondering if I were to take it orally, would a cyp3a4 inhibitor be beneficial?

So that's kinda wierd. Last time i took 2mgs, then another 2 mgs about 3 hours later. This time i took 2mgs and another 2mgs about am hour later. 

I guess what I'm getting at here is that even the same person, me, can have different timelines when it comes to sub induction. if i waited to follow the timelines exactly I'd probably not be feeling as close to normal as I feel now. 


I just wonder how long I can keep going back and forth between dope and subs before something stops working. I think my dope didn't work as great last time as i didn't wait long enough to dose after taking the subs. Part of me is scared that I like this bullshit back and forth, it's like I found a way to skirt the system and i wonder when i will be getting my comeuppance.. Nothing can work like this forever. I will either run out of subs or my tolerance will skyrocket to where I'm going to need to spend much more money to get high.

So I got my hands on some liquid methadone about 45mgs and suboxone.  I was going to Ailey take the suboxone but I think I ended up taking it to early and I wasn’t about 11mg of sub with little to no relieve.  That’s when I stumbled on the methadone and immediately took 30mgs yesterday around 4pm.

I took 10mg this morning so I am now left with 5mg which I plan to take in the AM tmrw.

I know methadone has a long half life but do you think this quick taper might allow me to skip H withdrawals all together or will I start to hurt and be forced to take the suboxone.  Which wouldn’t be that bad but I just got zero relief when I tried to induce myself on Saturday.

I am kicking .75-gram of ECP.  Should I try to get more methadone or will I be able to switch to suboxone pain free or will I sick w/ds all together?

He's been doing that for about eight months, but something different happened. I don't know a ton about suboxone, but I know you can't just stop taking it and be fine, especially on the 8mg he was on. Over Christmas I saw him and asked how it was going and he casually said he wasn't taking them anymore. I didn't really question it because it didn't hit me until today when my mom mentioned he was stopping by to pick up the money for his suboxone doctor appointment. I can't think of any other way these pieces fit together other than he is using again. I have never been addicted to opiates or a substance at all, so I don't know the exact signs.

I just feel so gloomy, so dead, everything is just pointless and I can't even shower. I feel like this is gonna last forever.

It's not that terrible as I am holding a good job but I'd rather have spent that on heroin. I have a bunch of bumps and scrapes that are painful and fuck I just want my dope already.

I'm so pissed off at myself for trying this shit. Snorting heroin isn't even that profound and I got stronger effects from oxy, but it's so much more... tantilizing. I can't explain it but I'm sure you know what I mean. Ever since my first dose, my every second thought has been about heroin. I'm worried I'm wasting a lot by snorting. 

Sorry, this is just turning into a rant in order to take my mind off the gloomy feelings of shit.

But on a whack ass, week Ass, dumbass rinse that didn’t do shit you registered like it wasn’t nothing. Work hard doing cash returns at Walmart for a $40 gift card and you still gotta bed the dboy to throw your ass a measly Ass tenth. And you can’t even hit your mofucking self, mane.

7p571d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7p571d/going_to_attempt_a_heroin_taper/,8,https://redd.it/7p571d,raviopi,Going to attempt a heroin taper,"I know, I know. Everybody is going to tell me it won’t work. Well I’m going to try my damndest. I’ve been on a binge for about 3 weeks. I’ve gotten back to my old gram a day of tar smoked on foil. So here’s what I have to work with:
I have about 0.35 left of a bag I bought last night to last me until Thursday (the next 2 days.) I know for certain that this will be enough to hold me over until then. I won’t really be high at all, but I certainly won’t be sick.
On Thursday I get my check. I am going to buy a gram (the last one) and continue to only smoke when I feel the withdrawal creeping in, and only smoking a very small amount to keep me well enough to function/work and sleep. 
After I run out of that gram, I’ll have two options (considering I haven’t given into temptation and I’ve been following the taper.) I can buy another gram and extend the taper, using even less over time, or I can drop off at that point and call it quits. I have an unlimited supply of loperamide and clonidine for free, so that’s what I’ll use for a bit when all is said and done to make the end as comfortable as possible. 
So what do you suggest? Do you think the taper will even work? Do you think I should taper with one gram, or go for a longer taper with 2? I need to be as comfortable as possible throughout this process, because I have to work in public (as a customer service manager) through the process. Help me with this situation if you have any input. Thanks.",1515478334.0

Bruising without even pushing plunger down.,"Hey all so this is a first for me... I having trouble finding a spot to shoot on my left arm. I looked in the mirror and could see my veins easier so I outlined/circled a few spots that I couldn't see just looking down on my arm. It's on my bicept.  I am all out of 31 guage needles so I bust out my clean new 29 guage ones. Stuck in wayy easier than re using the same 31 guages. 

So I pulled back on the plunger after poking it in and didn't register so I pulled the needle out of my arm. And immediately blood did come out(normally only happens after I get a shot in the vein) and that spot on my arm bruised and theres a lump like I missed a shot.  But I didn't injext into that spot at all.  I ended up only getting a partial in the end...  My left arm really needs a break but I never saw these veins on my bicept before looked clean and fresh until this bruise... I think it's weird how there's a lump and a bruise and I didn't inject anything.  Is this a sign of something worse? 

Thanks ahead of time. 

Also I did the same things in my hand where I didn't register but when I pulled out blood would come out like I did register. Like I said I never see blood come out unless it's a hit. ",1515474091.0

12 weeks and sex still seems like a chore to me.

My doc said she faxed all my records, but I still was afraid that the MRI wouldn't convince the pain doc that I needed anything.  Well, it turns out that she didn't send much of anything to the new doc and when she said that I figured I'd be fucked for at least another month till I could get the MRI faxed over.  But no, she basically gave me the same thing as my pcp.  Well, she dropped the mgs down from 20s to 10s.  The main reason I was getting 20s was cause I pay out of pocket and the lower the pill count, the cheaper the script. My pcp gives my half the number of pills at twice the mgs, so it's a lot cheaper.  I was so happy that I was getting something that I totally forgot to mention it, so my script was almost 70 bucks.  And she still wants the old MRI and a new one and an x-ray.  But I'm happy as hell that it went as smoothly as it did.

I'm more costly than diamonds, more costly than gold - the sorrow I bring is a sight to behold.
And if you need me, remember I'm easily found.
I live all around you, in schools and in town.
I live with the rich, I live with the poor, I live down the street, and maybe next door.
My power is awesome - try me you'll see.
But if you do, you may never break free.
Just try me once and I might let you go, but try me twice, and I'll own your soul.
When I possess you, you'll steal and you'll lie.
You'll do what you have to just to get high.
The crimes you'll commit, for my narcotic charms, will be worth the pleasure you'll feel in your arms.
You'll lie to your mother; you'll steal from your dad.
When you see their tears, you should feel sad.
But you'll forget your morals and how you were raised.
I'll be your conscience, I'll teach you my ways.
I take kids from parents, and parents from kids, I turn people from God, and separate from friends.
I'll take everything from you, your looks and your pride, I'll be with you always, right by your side.
You'll give up everything - your family, your home, your friends, your money, then you'll be alone.
I'll take and I'll take, till you have nothing more to give.
When I'm finished with you you'll be lucky to live.
If you try me be warned this is no game. 
If given the chance, I'll drive you insane.
I'll ravish your body, I'll control your mind.
I'll own you completely; your soul will be mine.
The nightmares I'll give you while lying in bed.
The voices you'll hear from inside your head.
The sweats, the shakes, the visions you'll see.
I want you to know, these are all gifts from me.
But then it's too late, and you'll know in your heart, that you are mine, and we shall not part.
You'll regret that you tried me, they always do.
But you came to me, not I to you.
You knew this would happen. 
Many times you were told, but you challenged my power, and chose to be bold.
You could have said no, and just walked away.
If you could live that day over, now what would you say?
I'll be your master; you will be my slave.
I'll even go with you, when you go to your grave.
Now that you have met me, what will you do?
Will you try me or not? 
Its all up to you.
I can bring you more misery than words can tell.
Come take my hand, let me lead you to hell.""

I got some H, and had snorted maybe half the bag a few days ago,  and got a needle and stuff because IV smack is meant to be some of the best euphoria you can get out of a drug. So anyway, today, I cooked up, had the needle in my vein, and had a fucking epiphany about my life, saw that I needed to turn things round. For the first time in my life, I had the willpower to not do a drug.. it's made me really happy.

Sorry if this is a pointless story, just really needed to share it

I in short spammed her on occasions, but I never meant to creep her out or make her hate me or make her feel anxious.

But occasionally I see people get on their junkie high horse and have this unhealthy superiority complex. And I just feel like it's up to us who have been around the block a time or two to educate these people so they don't make the same mistakes instead of insulting them and making them feel stupid for not knowing any better. I feel like the majority of the community here is good about educating instead of insulting, but this is more directed towards the minority that aren't so good about it.

I wanted to binge during the holidays, wanted to get a clear head for a week and start working again tmrw. But I binged until now. Yesterday I stayed awake forever, shooting speedballs and overslept until 4pm today. I overslept a date that should've brought in 300 bucks, that guy won't meet me again I guess. That's shitty. Since a new law came last year, I can't use online platforms to look for customers without running the danger to pay at least a fine and be registered as a prostitute. So I've been meeting only guys I know and like which are exactly 2. One of those 2 doesn't live in Germany and only comes around every other month for business trips. I mean, I study, my career is a thing that could happen. I did everything right until now and never slipped up so bad that my addiction was suspected. But limits are being pushed I think. 




 I'm as broke as I can get right now. Can't draw money with any of my cards and now I'm sitting here, waiting for the man, hoping he'll front me enough to get through the day. 




I overslept my maintenance doc, too, didn't pick up my script for tomorrow and now I don't have money, don't have drugs and have a miserable coke hangover. I hate myself. How am I supposed to get through work? How am I going to get through that oral exam on the 23rd? Haven't studied enough by far. How can I be so stupid? I wish I would die before I gamble away everything... When I think about getting clean, I just don't see it. Of course atm I'm not in the best mood, but if today wasn't my last free day I would've missed work without calling in sick. It. Wouldn't have been the first time and excuses last only so long. Hope you guys are having a better day. 




PS: I got my dope, managed to not fiend for coke and hope that I can get home and fall asleep in time to get up punctual tomorrow.

They threw everything they could at it, Torodol, Ativan, Zofran, Reglan, Benadryl, Bentyl, Zanaflex, Pepsid, and so forth before finally having to give me a 1mg dose of Dilaudid by IV. 

I felt and still do feel like I've been defeated. However, I had the following text conversation with my mom:

>Me: They're gonna try reglan and benadryl and call [pain doctor]

>Mom: Okay sweetheart I am hoping that works!!! 💖🙏

>Me: It didn't work they called [pain doctor]. They're gonna do a one time dose of Diluadid. They made the decision for me. Then they're gonna discharge me. I see [pain doctor] tomorrow and [GI Doctor] tuesday.  ... I think it'll prevent an admission at least.

>Mom: Oh wow sorry it didn't work

>Me: ***I'm not going to reset my sobriety counter either. Cause this is legitimate I tried so hard to avoid it. too.***

>Mom: you worked hard and ***this is not recreational. I agree.***

>Me: Thanks ya. Definitely not recreational. Thank you. That alone means a lot. I'm so bummed to be in this situation. I was just hoping it would improve ya know?

>Mom: 💖🙏💖🙏

So I think that sums things up. I'm currently getting IV Hydration at my doctor's office and attempting to avoid more pain medications/going back to the hospital/ER. I guess this is my reality.
