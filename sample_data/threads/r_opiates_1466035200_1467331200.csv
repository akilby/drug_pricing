4oe0cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4oe0cn/too_much_pst/,10,https://redd.it/4oe0cn,The_Dawkness,Too much PST?!?!?!?,"Ok, so, one day about 6 months ago I was on like this binge of poppy seed bagels. I mean, they were good. This local deli I live near does these bagels that are like, 90% poppy seeds 10% Jewish Flour or whatever they're made of, and I started getting this real buzz after eating like 4 of them. So, smash cut to a month later, and I'm out back of the deli every few days buying bags of their poppy seeds for 20 bucks a point and making that shit into a fire ass tea, just like the guys in this thread say to do. Needless to say, for only like 100 bucks I was FAAAAAAAKED up most of the time. I would put the half gram of poppy seeds into a blender, then pour what came out in a coffee cup and put in some Dr. P***er (didn't want to put the full name as it might be sourcing) and like, 10 minutes later get SOOOOO high up. I would like, listen to music or maybe work out or whatever. It had been a good run, but as I am only a lowly high school counselor I didn't make enough money to keep that habit going as long as I stayed around at my job talking to these drug addict pieces of crap that I have to talk to on a daily basis. Well, after 6 months of my habit I started going broke. 

Yesterday I decided to take action. I have a history of being able to handle myself in tense situations. One time at the high school I work at these two kids were talking crap to each other and I heard it from my office. Me being the responsible adult I am I ran to the scene of the fracas and put myself in between these two guys with a circle of ranting children around them and said, ""Hey kids, shows's over, everybody go to your classes!"" Which was by far the coolest thing I've ever done and definitely shows that I am the man you want in your corner in a sticky situation. 

So, to make a short story long, I walked in to the local Bank of America in my area and pulled out a pellet gun I had confiscated from one of the students at Timothy Leary Memorial High School and put that badboy to the neck of the security guard standing right inside the doors. I said, ""Listen, little man, I'm here to rob this here bank, and there's nothing you or the fuzz can do about it, so walk up to the tellers and tell them to put all the money in this bag!"" Then, I handed him my favorite North Face bag and he proceeded to get the money. All the employees dropped to the floor and the customers ran out so fast they could have won the blue ribbon in our annual TLMHS 100 meter dash. Anyways, the guard had the audacity to say that my gun wasn't real so I shot him 11 times in the throat and face with my .17 caliber pellets and he went down. Then I reloaded and threatened two of the bank's employees who were refusing to put any monies in the bag, but they didn't listen, So I had to shoot them around 18 times each, with 3 reloads, and they finally went down. 

So now I've been standing inside the bank with around 4 thousand dollars in cold hard cash, ready to exchange for nearly a whole ounce of those sweet poppy seeds that have been getting me so high, but I've been on the phone on and off for the last 8 hours with the cops outside, and they don't sound happy. I've only killed like 1 and a half people and I've got this money but I've got to get out of the bank before I go into WD's.

Any tips?",1466092267.0

So, i thought maybe we could do a weekly thread type of deal where people can bring there hardships and feelings and lay it all out there. The rest of the group can respond how ever they feel fit. Offer advice, encouragement, or just let them know they are listening. The things don't necessarily have to be opiate related, recent or anything specific what so ever, just anything you wanna get off your chest.

I want to try out Exalgo (the ER version of hydromorphone), probably around the 36mg + probably 2 4mg dilaudids per day (at first, then up to 8mg twice a day).

Does anyone have any experience between the two? I know that the new Opana ERs are complete shit, so does anyone know if the Exalgo is the same or better? 

Also, as for ROA: the Opana IRs nasal BA is 43%, where the Dilaudids are 52-58%. Given that Opana oral BA is 10%, the hydromorphone is 30-35%.

Im still so depressed and im so alone. Idk what to do. I miss college. I realize I was also so co dependant. Heroin was the only thing that made me okay with being alone. I remember in college I had a thing going of always having at least 3 fwb always going at a time. That way I could always have someone to just sleep with every weekend but not get too attached or show them how crazy I was. Whenever I tried to have just one girl I became obsessed with them to the point they needed space. 

I had an amazing relationship with a girl so far out of my league while I was on pills and she was happy and I was high all the time and in love. But after 4 months I confess I was an addict then only to Oxy so it was easy to hide. She helped me get clean thinking it would be good for us. After that she became my drug. Sex became my drug and so I tried to use her to fill a hole inside me that drugs have filled. I know I need to work on my issues but im losing it. I NEED to find some girl and fuck. 

Since quiting dope I feel like a 15 year old it driving me wild. Idk how to handle this sex drive. While high I could get laid so easy. 1 I was in college and it's easy and 2 I didn't care about sex so I was cool and confident. I would talk to girls to just talk and end up finding them hitting on me and me playing it off pushing them away made them want me more in a way. 

Now that I'm going around the bar trying to fuck anytging I fail terribly and its ruining my confidence and just makes me want to numb my feels and go back to drug where I didn't care about sex or how I looked or cared about anything but getting high. 

Idk what im looking for maybe just people that can relate and have been there before. Im sorry for this shit post and im sorry if I come off like a shity person. I think I am a pretty shity person sober. I feel like I was much more caring and compassionate using drugs now I tell myself im clean so I think im better when I go around being selfish as fuck.

Hopefully done for good, and a warning to any newbies","Hello all- I've mostly been a lurker on this sub for a while, posting on occasion. last month I posted a thread about how I was planning on using some ECP as landing gear for coke.

how it went down was that before I went out that night, I railed a point of some very nice ECP. and then proceeded to do way too much coke all night long with some friends, all while still pretty strung out on the ecp. when I got back home that morning, I railed another point as landing gear and passed out.

I then woke up in a hospital bed three days later. turns out my mother came home from work to find me laying in a pool of my own vomit and blood, pale face and blue lips, the works. I received narcan and immediately  went into surgery, and then into the ICU. I was clinically dead for 10 minutes and I had a heart attack, and I probably have some permanent heart damage.

The day after I was discharged from the hospital I was sent to a 30-day inpatient recovery center. it was located in a very upscale place (it was in a renovated mansion). it was a brand new facility so we had a small, close knit group of some of the absolute BEST people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. the genuine love and care we had for each other was something I never thought was possible. I laughed more there than I had ever while using! the nights spent watching netflix, smoking cigs, shooting the shit.. the rules were super relaxed and all of the counselors were super nice (most were former addicts themselves). we all got along great, and I plan on keeping in touch with them for the rest of my life. of course there were some intense group sessions that went to dark places, but we always had each others' back.

I just got out this morning and I'm excited to start working a program and getting my life back on track. I'm lucky to be alive. hell, I'm lucky to not be on a feeding tube right now. overdoses can happen to anyone.
I'm not trying to preach to you guys, I just want to send the message that YES you can overdose by snorting. if you think you're doing too much, you definitely are and should chill out.

(You Know You're a Junkie When...),"A long lost thread from year ago on a forum that has gone the way of most forums since Reddit came along had a hilarious thread that always cheered me up called 'You Know You're a Junkie When...'

I was hoping to revive it here, so feel free to shit post to your hearts content all the crap we end up doing and dealing with on a daily basis when you're an opiate user.

Let me get the ball rolling.. (or the blob flowing, the beetle burning..)

YKYAJW... you have to correctly time the entrance to your own home in order to avoid being seen by the nextdoor neighbours, the flat above you, below you. in fact, anybody with a line of sight to your door because you owe them all money.

YKYAJW... the crime statistics for your zip code seem to indicate you live in a crime hotspot.. weird. I can't think why.

YKYAJW... Pharmacists know you by name and have your takeaway ready by the time you reach the counter - not because you;re a polite and regular customer, but to get you out of there as quickly as possible before you nod out in the waiting area.

YKYAJW... getting that bag you lost in your car is more important than the interior lining of said car.. hence the reason you've taken a screwdriver and a blade to your seats, the air conditioning, the carpet... you found the bag, but your car looks like it was attacked by a Velociraptor. And..... worth it.

YKYAJW... Despite using all the lamps and lights in the room, there still isn't enough illumination to get your next shot because your pupils are just too tiny.

YKYAJW... You've got a nickname that the local paper uses whenever you appear in it (The 'Purple-Poppy-Poacher' strike again - after making off with half of several old ladies entire gardens in area of the UK with Victorian architecture and purple poppies were fashionable several hundred years ago. Prolific amounts of opium grows in summer in these old house gardens)

YKYAJW... You think about Yesterday-You (who you constantly curse!) and Tomorrow-You, who you're about to fuck over so that You-right-now can get a fucking hit!

YKYAJW... The very real possibiity of death doesn't even slow us down and when we discuss what any normal person would consider serious physical abuse or even torture if it were inflicted on somebody else - yet we willingly do it to ourselves - these discussions are so commonplace we don't even notice any more.

YKYAJW... due to your vast hands on experience with the human circulatory system, you could probably make money by hanging around hospitals offering to take exams for vascular surgeons and phlebotomy students.


YKYAJW... quitting is made even more difficult by knowing just how boring real life is compared to the insanity of the hustle.",1466032785.0

I was so dumb - I emptied out all my blister packs into one jar. Also the jar is big and for this reason there is lots of air in the jar, even though it is airtight.

Normally one 10mg capsule makes me feel something but I've just taken 30mg and NOTHING.

quick note: i'm typing this with one hand so please excuse the shitty punctuation and possible typos

So two days ago, Monday night, as usual, I was getting high and listening to music at the computer. Took about 50 or 60mg of Oxy, quite a few lines of H, and my daily benzos (the benzos are prescribed, and i took less than i usually take). NOTE: This would be a risky combo for many many people so please dont do the same. But I do this often so in grand total the amount of depressants in my system was on the smaller side than it often was/is.

I rarely catch a nod these days but i had woken up too late that morning to take my RX'd Vyvanse (amphetamines) so i was feeling drowsier and sleepier than usual. Around 10:45pm, the drugs mixing with the shoegaze were really starting to hit their stride, and I started to nod. I'm thinking ""fuck yes!"" because I always loved the nod, so I roll with it, close my eyes, and drift off while sitting/slumped in my computer desk chair. I came out of the nod about an hour later, at 11:45pm and I notice my left arm feels funny. I can't raise my hand. My arm must have fallen asleep, right? Wrong... I shake the hell out of my hand like it owes me $12 but something isn't right. My hand still won't ""wake up"". My wrist is completely limp and flopping over, and I can't get any feeling into my fingers. It's feeling completely dead.  I start panicking, google the symptoms, freak out more, tell myself it will go away in the morning, and go to sleep.

Guess what? Yeah. That shit didn't go away in the morning. Turns out I now have ""radial nerve palsy"", also known as ""saturday night palsy"". It's what happens when you go to sleep with your arm in a position that pinches/compresses your radial nerve. if you're not drunk or on drugs, most people will roll over and untrap their arm. but if you're messed up on depressants you're less likely to move out of that position.  I must have had it happen when my arm was squashed against the hard plastic edge of my arm rest while I was nodding. My case of RNP isn't as bad as some people I've come across in my research, as now I can move my fingers alright, but it's no joke. I can't type, I can barely tie my shoes, and for all intents and purposes I have lost 50% of the function in my left hand. Radial Nerve Palsy can take months to heal, too. This sucks.

Long story short: if you're starting to nod, make sure your arms are not in a weird position where they are crushed against a wall or trapped under your body or against a desk chair..etc. make sure your arms are free from hard surfaces and/or dont have a lot of weight/pressure on them.

 You really, really, don't want this to happen to you. I was nodding with my arm in a weird position for an hour tops, and now I'm looking at weeks to months to regain motion and feeling in my hand. I can't even hold a cup of coffee without spilling it everywhere. please be careful y'all. I just wanted to post about this in a harm reduction sense, maybe someone will see this and subsequently avoid getting RNP, like my crippled ass.",1466011034.0

Years... Whatever. Either way it was always to get me some IR oxy, whether it be oxynorm or endone, just anything that I could take and feel within an hour. 

After realizing I was hooked, I went to my family doctor, the actual GP I grew up seeing as a kid. He was totally cool about it, even gave him permission to ring Medicare and get my prescription history, he doesn't judge. 

So anyway. We decide on a taper plan that consists of no immediate release oxycodone. He's also put me on the drugs of dependency watch list (I can't get oxy or any other schedule 8 medicine from anywhere except one pharmacy, and if I try the computer fucking explodes and the pharmacist politely denies filling the script. 

Ok, that seems fair, I thought. After all I had come to see him with complete transparency and try to get off these drugs. 

So he starts me on 30mg Oxycontin (prior to this I was taking 70-100mg of immediate release once a day and normally after work), and he says take three or four all at once in the morning. 

How does this compare to immediate release oxycodone and what are the pros and cons of doing this instead of 90-120mg in one go? He says it lasts all day, I don't think it will quite match what I was doing previously but that's what I'm here to ask you guys. 

Oxycontin - is it any good? Is extended release a good alternative to immediate? Etc etc. Anybody with advice or info please share. :)",1466164250.0

I had to go to rehab twice use suboxone and then quit that with tramadol  which took me 3 years now some day i just take 50 mg of tramadol or 300 depending on my back aches. But i can't wait for thanks giving so i can shoot up ( of course im not gonna plunge the whole shot at ones and OD i do it super slowly and have some one their with naloxone)  . So i call my friend in juarez and he tells me that the heroin trade is still holding ultra strong that i should not worry cops still ignore even fighting it . They moslty just arrest junkies but not dealers because the dealers are super hard core know where the cops family lives and stuff like that . However some times the federal police do manage to scare of the dealers and some federal police will arrest them . But then again the heroin trade always stand strong ! :))))) they should just make it legal and tax it ",1466163061.0

I made a post a few days ago about sobriety sucking major balls. Literally minutes after having finished replying to all the comments (thanks for everyones encouraging words by the way, didn't really work though obviously), I discovered I had some surprise money on my account. So what to do if not buy some bitcoins and order some dope. So, I've been clean for like 5 weeks now but I've been waiting on my relapse since wednesday. I've tried to convince myself to flush it when it gets here but lol that's not going to happen. 

Anyhow it's Friday, the mail was just delivered and the fucking dope hasn't arrived yet! Should have been here by wednesday according to the vendor. I mean yeah it might arrive next week and if I knew that I'd be fine. Now I'm just sitting around praying to JJ that there will be a second mail delivery for some reason. I'm stuck in junkie limbo and I'm not even in withdrawals! Fucking fuck this is bullshit.

Sorry I just needed to vent I'm going fucking insane just sitting around waiting. At least now I know that I won't get high this weekend and won't have my hopes up. So yeah, now I'm drunk before noon and I'll probably stay drunk til sunday night. Alcohol is so lame when you want dope. It's like having a cracker when your fiending for pizza.

I don't have a car so I was walking and taking the bus from 8am til about an hour ago, 7pm...... the first place I found gave me the wrong info, had two workers arguing with each other, they sent me to the needle exchange that I usually go to.... they don't do wound care. The exchange gave me about 5 numbers to call, all of them either told me they couldn't help me or it'd be at least $130 up front, no payment plan. It also seemed like every number I called had someone else to recommend, who would just recommend someone else. After getting back home around 1pm or so I started calling every health place there was.... and to my surprise the best one was the local University's ER! Because I'm unemployed and don't have insurance (I'm quite the catch, ladies) I was able to qualify for some kind of government aid, I haven't paid anything yet, and I don't think I will have to because of my lack of income. I'll get my scripts for free, too. Couple different antibiotics. Turns out it was cellulitis in my vein. So an infection. Either I forgot to swab or something got in after I hit, or something wasn't quite as clean as I thought it was. The only pharmacy within walking distance is closed already so I'm gonna have to continue this trek to heal my poor veins via bus. So now I guess you know, (unless you already knew) if you're un(der)employed and uninsured you can get ""emergency access"" I guess it's called.  PS the dude testing my blood fucked up the vein on my other arm.... you'd think the mofo would know how to hit a vein.**

 I know this is /r/opiates, but more of you guys use needles. I was shooting very high quality cocaine, I thought I found a new spot so I wouldn't add to my track marks. I tied the tourniquet about 6 inches up from my elbow, and felt for a vein in my bicep. I felt one, hit, registered and drew blood, pushed, I did not miss, I've missed plenty of shots before and know what they feel like.

I always thought as long as you drew blood is was ok to IV even if it's in a ""muscle-y"" area? I did the whole warm massage for hours, no luck. I've unnecessarily freaked out about missed shots and raised bumps/marks/histamine reactions before, but they always go away after an hour or two. It's been over 24 hours now and there is a tender, raised, red mark 2-3 inches long starting where I hit. I'm starting to freak out some.

I don't have insurance and have very little money. Are there ""free clinics"" that are actually free and won't judge an IV user? Where do I look? I tried searching in my area (city USA) but most require payment, and an old friend that used to work at such a place told me that the owner refused to help remove a broken syringe tip from someone's arm. Please help me, I don't want to lose my arm. Everywhere online says if it lasts more than a day to seek medical attention but I can't afford it. Any help?



**EDIT:** Thank you all for your help, sorry to freak out on you guys. I found the literal IDEAL place, they specialize in homeless outreach/HIV/behavioral/substance abuse, don't need insurance, same day appointment, sliding scale payment plan, HIPAA, a quick bus ride from my apartment, the works. Thank you all for your help, I'll be able to make an appointment for sometime tomorrow at 7am. Many thanks to you guys and the universe. I guess even using new rigs, sterile water, and alcohol wipes you still run a risk. Stay safe brothers and sisters, you're all loved. If you're not already aware you can order diabetes syringes for your insulin online for like $0.20 each, and there's probably at least one exchange in your area. I've always greatly appreciated needle exchanges and free HIV/Hep C/STD testing but never had to utilize other community social services. I'm grateful there's help available for people that need it.

I've got one of those 7-day plastic pill holders, but my concern in using that is that someone will want to see scripts and I don't have any. Also since kratom is legal where I'm at, would it be fine to just take those in their unopened packs or in their over the counter bottles? I've also read here that tsa doesn't care about otc bottles but customs does, and I've read some conflicting info about whether this stuff should be in the checked bag or in the carry on.

4ogelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4ogelz/welpim_screwed/,54,https://redd.it/4ogelz,kara_t_chop,Welp...i'm screwed.,"Today I got fired.

There is nobody in my life who I can tell the truth as to WHY I got fired except for the people on this sub.  Because I know you guys might be able to see why.

I have been working at this restaurant for almost a year.  I'm a waitress.  It's a good place, the money was decent for a while.  But recently, the money has started to suck.  We are getting less and less customers, and my manager has had it out for me since day 1 that I began working there.  He makes comments towards me that are incredibly hurtful, constantly singles me out, etc. 
I live on my own so when the money started getting really bad, I was having difficulty paying rent and my bills along with keeping my head above water and not drowning in withdrawal.  I had a semi-large H habit, however I cut it down a lot because I sniff and I started not getting high *anyway* so there was really no point to snorting a shitload of stuff in one sitting.
So i cut myself down to about 2 bundles a day (i dont know what that translates to in grams--I get ECP). Soon, that was not even affordable.  
I found a way to manipulate my checks, I'm not going to get into the whole process, but by using coupons I was able to get an extra $10 here and there.
Well, they followed my activity on the POS system computers at the restaurant and caught me. 
Today, I came to work to begin my shift, and the manager says ""(my name), don't clock in.  We have to talk"". I immediately knew I was caught and that this was the end.
Now I have no fucking idea what to do.  Yes i can start applying to more restaurants which is what I began doing the second I got home.  I feel like a piece of shit as it is, so please save it if anyone wants to lecture me.  I'm really upset right now.  I was always able to balance a job and a home with this addiction, but now I'm seeing it affect my life.  And I think it is time i figure out what to do to quit.
I'm gonna have a lot of free time for a little bit.  Was thinking of cold turkey detoxing.  But I can get my hands on a few subs if I want, at least I'm pretty sure, as I just met somebody who mentioned they have subs for sale.  So I just don't know if I should do this cold turkey, use subs, or not quit yet because I don't even know if I'm ""ready"".  I just hate seeing this addiction affect my life.  For so long it was just something I did on the side that didn't make an impact on my regular life.  Now it is.  I'm just so fucking upset.  Can anyone please just give me some sort of advice or counsel?  I feel like a moron, not to mention im SUPER embarrassed because knowing this manager he definitely told the entire staff, some of them whom I have grown pretty close with, and now all these people definitely think I'm a piece of shit, too.
Makes me just want to break myself out another giant rail and lay down and cry.


TL;DR  I got fired from my job for manipulating coupons and essentially stealing money from the restaurant.  I dont know what to do anymore.  ",1466120616.0

I've rarely used reddit before, but my boyfriend was on it often, especially this subreddit. I'm looking for advice and stories to help me figure out what to do next.

I met him eight months ago at a party friends of mine were throwing. We left and went somewhere quieter and talked for hours about our lives. He told me about his drug use in previous years. I saw his track marks then, but said nothing, choosing instead to wait for him to address them. Two days later, he told me about IV heroin. He talked about it with difficulty, clearly wanting the truth to be out there, but ashamed at what he was saying. The next day when I saw him again, I told him that I could not share him with heroin- I would support him in getting clean, but I wouldn't let someone I cared about (and even that early into the relationship, I knew I already cared about him immensely and could feel myself already loving him) share me with the drug. He thought about it, and he said okay.

For four-five days, I held him as he went through withdrawals. It was terrifying- I had known him around a week, and he was letting me hold him through what has to be the most supreme type of pain imaginable. And then, we were through. He had made it, and there was such a spring of life in him that I hadn't seen before. 

From what he's told me now, he was actually clean for a very short time after that before he relapsed. At some point, it wasn't as much as a relapse as it was simply using. He would periodically tell me about a 'relapse'- a mixture of needing to commit to some shred of truth in order to create a convincing cover for his continuing drug use and the occasional and unlikely overwhelming of guilt over apathy. All the while, he told me of how important truth was and how he was finally free the lies and the darkness in which he had lived for so long. At that point, he had been a polysubstance abuser for around four years, culminating in mostly opiate use for the past few months. I was naive to the game and took his word for nearly everything he said.

He was sober for a week and a half around Christmas. Not out of choice, but out of circumstance. He soon had access to his drug of choice again and continued to use. 

Throughout this time he stole and lied constantly- nothing I need to go into detail about. They are the same stories many of you probably know or have experienced at some point. 

At one point, I thought he had been clean for 10 weeks. Of course, I understand now that this was not true. I wasn't blind to the symptoms of his drug use: he was nodding off often and money was disappearing, but there was always an excuse and a reason. And I always believed. Questioned him, but believed.

One night I found foil in his bathroom in which he had wrapped powder. The next few days were hell as he unraveled what had been happening- still not sharing the full extent. At his own deciding and not at my request, he told his parents about his addiction and asked to go to rehab once the semester ended (we are both students at a midwestern university). He later told my own parents about his addiction and his plans to go to rehab, as well as one of my sisters with whom I am especially close.

In the last week before I drove him to the airport, he stole another  $800 from me. He stayed high and I was oblivious. The day before he entered his program, he called to tell me everything: how he hadn't been truly sober since Christmas, how he had stolen more than I could ever know, and other secrets he had kept. He talked about how he finally felt the pain he had caused and that he ""couldn't do it anymore"". He told his parents that it was IV heroin and not pills, and that he had lied and broken my trust (I am a recent victim of a sexual assault, so this was particularly volatile). 

He is nearly halfway through his 10 week program. His parents and I haven't had any contact with him except through emails screened by a therapist. We don't know what the next step will be once this program is over, but he is not returning to our school in the fall. 

I love him more than I ever thought could be possible. I was told that it was a miracle that he loved me in the first place- that I could reach through the drug and guide him to emotion.  I want him to be well and I want to be able to spend my life with him, as we had planned.

This might be the wrong venue for sharing this story, but I hope that someone out there can help me. My silly sort of blindness towards all of this is probably extremely evident here- but is there anyone who can offer some sort of guidance? 

Thank you xoxo",1466097658.0

I have stumbled across the opiate forum within reddit and have been reading posts tonight -- thought I mise well ask some questions I am looking for answers too..

I have been struggling with Heroin addiction for the past 8 months (snorting) ... I could go into all of the details blah blah, but I really am just looking for some input on my WD's...

Before 10 days ago I have been averaging .2-.5 of a gram a day of H..About 10 days ago I took a Wednesday, Thursday, Friday off work and stopped the H wednesday -- stayed off for 6 whole days and went through the worst of the widthdrawal .. like all of you understand I caved to the cravings, and have been back on for another... 5 days.. but this time only using about .1 of a gram a day.. 5 days..

My question is.. are my widthdrawals going to be a little easier than the last if I start tomorrow? (I know each day I keep going its going to be harder and harder of a widthdrawal.. but for some reason I feel like these might be a bit easier than the last because I did have that 6 day stint away from it) I have a script for clonidine, and gabapentin, I bought some L-tyrosine and vitamin B6 to load up on ..  I have some immodium (i've read 25MG - 50 MG a day for a few days might help too).. 

Really I am just scared again shitless that the WD's will be bad and wondering since I havent been back on that long (even though I didn't really give myself long enough in the first place) my WD's might be easier?? 

BTW.. i also just got done reading the survival guide which helped.. really just wondering since ive been back on these last 5 days, am i going to experience a typical bad WD or did my 6 days clean help at all to make this a bit easier???

4onbxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4onbxq/cold_copping_success/,14,https://redd.it/4onbxq,jadefaux,Cold Copping Success !,"Hey there! I've been lurking for awhile and I posted about asking for cold copping advice and it was removed because I mentioned the city name. But today was a success....somewhat! I've been using bth for a couple of years in CA and always had a solid connect and backups if needed! The connect was like no other I've ever come across. It was literally a dispatch service run by Hispanics. You call and place your order and they have a driver meet you in less then 20 minutes every time! The quality was always consistent and never cut with fent. They opened at 7am and closed at 8pm, seven days a week! It was horrible for my habit because it was to easy to score. Well I flew out a few states over for the summer to visit my Dad and his new family. I had a decent amount of clean time under my belt so I was far past WD's and all that jazz. 

Well a few days after I arrived here I decided to go on a bike ride and explore my summertime playground! I carried no cash on me because I wasn't planning on picking up anything just a carefree stroll through the town. Well I landed in the heart of downtown and almost immediately was approached by a corner boy when we locked eyes...I explained I had no money but was interested further down the line. He promptly gave me his burner cell number and I was on my way. The days to come I was overwhelmed with desire to cop bth or any strong opiate at that! 

So today I decided I was going to get high no matter the odds! I hop on my bike and call the dboy who's number I recently acquired. No luck...the phone doesn't even ring and the call is ended abruptly. The day I received it I made sure to check it was him and everything was legit. But the day I have money and the motivation there is no answer. So I say fuck it I will ride through the city and collect my prize somehow! 

And so the journey begins...it was a three hour bike ride there and back. Not counting the down time. I casually stroll out of the town and with must haste begin pedaling to reach my destination as quick as possible with my new found excitement. I reach downtown in record time 55 minutes instead of 90 minutes like before. 

As I am strolling through the city I instantly become aware of the heavy police presence. Was it like this last time, or is it just because now I have intent to commit a crime? I race to the spot where I met the corner boy a few days back...no luck he is no where in site. I ride around for about an hour in a 5 mile radius looking for him or any other dboy...No luck....then I began to fiend as if I was dope sick! I rode all the way down here and was starting to realize this cold copping dream may just be a fantasy for today. So I decide to ask the local homeless and the obvious addicts. The homeless engulf in shock when they realize the black or Chiva I was asking actually meant heroin. I didn't want a lecture if you can't point me in the right direction then have a nice day man! I ask the younger addicts and one girl says yea but the connect is far away let's take the train. So I lock my bike up and hop on the train with this random girl. And as fast as that adventure began it ended with her just running off from me and ignoring my yells. Oh well back to get my bike...I ask about a dozen people when I return and have no luck...right as I decide this was a failed attempt and maybe it was like this way for a reason...I get flagged down by a younger addict trying to trade his phone for my bike. I explain to him that's not going to happen but do you know where I can score I will shoot you some money. ALAST, he says someone in Mickey Dee's behind me has what I need! Excitement devours all my current emotions! And the Dboy walks out. He asks the usual how much I need and I said a gram...he gives me a puzzled look and explains he only has 20$ worth. At this point I didn't mind a little dub I was literally on my way home and had given up. He reaches for the baggy and out comes the dope! He hands it to me and I open it to smell it and confirm this is actually bth and not some gimmick. And you bet your ass it was! About 0.35 to be exact and I gladly give him my money and we part ways. He wouldn't give me his cell after telling me he is reupping soon but he asks for mine. Pretty sure this kid just wanted to sell the rest of his personals to reup! I have no problem with that as long as we both get what we need! I give the kid who flagged me down for my bike 10$ and some cigarettes. I was in a generous mood! I rode home as quick as I could and smoked the second I arrived! The quality is 5/10 compared to my hometown connect but I'm not complaining! This bth is definitely that harsh sugar tasting bullshit but with months of clean time on my belt prior it very well does the trick! 

I plan on cold copping a lot this summer! Hopefully original corner boys phone will be turned back on because I'm back in the saddle again!

I was attempting to get my shift at work tomorrow night covered so I sent a group text to two people I work with looking for another lady's phone number.  I was texting with my girl at the same time and sent the following text to my coworkers instead of my girl on accident:

""Hey, so I'm just going to work my shift tomorrow night.  Make some money.  Do me a favor though and pick those up for me and hold them until Sunday or else I'd take them.""

Almost everyone at my job is in recovery so they will most likely be able to read between the lines on this.  My question for you manipulative, creative and quick thinking boys and girls is what could I say that I was asking to be picked up?  Opiates are a HUGE no go at this place and I'm hoping that their first thought isn't  that I'm talking about  dope.  I am not adverse to telling them, if they bring it up that is, that I was talking about more socially acceptable prescription drugs like Adderall however if one of you fine folks can come up with something that doesn't involve any kind of drug abuse I am all ears.

Bear in mind that I did refer to it as ""them"" so it'd have to be more than one.  Also, keep in mind I mentioned that I'd be worried that I would take them before Sunday...

 Most of us here are professional fibbers and some of us are professional downright liars.

I used to chew the old patches or smoke the gel in small amounts. I dont really have the patience for any prolonged extraction method unless its absolutely necessary. Anyways does anyone have any experience with this particular make, and if so what is the easiest way to get a concentrated dose of fent off of these?

So the material used is glassine, right?

Second issue, I can find those bags here in online shops only in bigger dimensions like 10 x 16 cm. The length is fine but they are always to wide.

Here is a photo of the ones I can get here:
http://i.imgur.com/i3OrB38.png

They are called 'bottom bags' (obv. because they have a bottom when unfolded and are not flat :D)  Are these similar to your stamp bags?

Could someone provide me with the dimensions of one of those bags and / or a close up photo with a lighter or something beside to it for comparison? Maybe an unopened and an opened one, if possible. Perhaps I'm imagining them smaller as they are.

I know there are lots of photos around but it's hard to tell how big they actually are. When I've got more information on them I might have a chance to find them in some online shop.

It sounds right up my alley to alternate between  pst, then tramadol, then kratom, then norco. I'd like to get to where I could use a different opiate every day to help stave off physical addiction.

So I want to be safe doing this I've read it can be a bit dangerous if you're not careful or get over zealous . Also aware potency varies.

Here's my current tolerance. When I take hydros (maybe once a week if I'm lucky) it's usually a 100mg dose divided into 50 and 50. And I yet high. Like really really high. This has been my prefered dose for years. I try to keep it under that 90mg spot where respritory depression gets dangerous.

When I take tramadol, if it weren't for the seizure risk I'd prolly take 500mg. But daily I take 200mg divided . And I'm barley high at all . I feel it, but warm and fuzzy I ain't (trams get weird at high doses anyways. But they are really good for chronic bone pain).

I'm a kratomsaurous rex. I usually take kratom everyday (unless I know I've got some agonists in my future that day) usually about 20g to 30g a day. Imo that's a maximum dose.

With said tolerance in mind. What quantity of seeds should I use to be safe. I want to do a tester dose firat to test quality, and I'll be in ohio so I'll have narcane (no prescrption needed there) avaliable just in case.

So what would be a good tester dose? What would be a good starter dose? What's too too much and dangerous?

While I did find some great ideas and answers, truth is it still sucks.  I am over majority of the physical symptoms with exception of a few days of continued diarrhea (nothing like first few days) which Imodium clears up quickly. I also still have no energy or drive to do anything at all. The main problem now is being alone with my own thoughts.  I am finding right now that is a bad place to be.   I try to stay busy during the day which helps. I have also started exercising which has been a life saver.  Some days it takes every fiber of my being to even put one foot on the floor to get my ass out of bed.  Its a viscous cycle.

I seem to have this almost paralyzing anxiety - gets much worse at night again while its quiet and I'm alone in my dam head again.  I still have insomnia - horrible and so far has been the worst symptom.  I pray this improves soon. I literally stare at the clock and the minutes drag on.  I keep thinking that eventually I have to sleep from pure exhaustion right???  Wrong. Its amazing how many days one can go with little to no sleep.  Who knew?  I also have RLS which makes me want to punch my self in the face repeatedly.   I have 2 amazing kids that i want to be with and have fun with.  Right now its hard to even fake it and makes me feel awful.  I have the most amazing supportive family which has helped. Especially my husband, not sure how he does it but he is sweet, patient and encouraging.  It would almost be easier if he was pissed off and mad at me but he isn't.  He actually feels bad for me and wants to help me in any way he can.  Which brings me to the next part I'm having trouble with.  I have this sense of guilt, embarrassment, humiliation.... you get the idea.  I just cant shake it.  SO bad that i cannot face anyone yet.  I cant shake these thoughts of how horrible I was, all the bad things i did to get high, all the people i lied to and stole from to get high.  Basically i am a selfish piece of shit.

I have not slept since 4:00 AM Friday. I don't know why I've got such horrendous insomnia, but here we are. Usually, when sleep eludes me like this, it's because I'm dope sick.

Then I have to sleep there for the next two weeks. This is longest I've ever gone without sleep without being either dope sick/super high. Jesus Christ I couldn't be more stressed. At least I haven't been sick for the last three days.

And, seeing as how 2.5 hours of sleep won't really do me much good except make me groggy and angry, I think I'm gonna do my last shot, cuddle with my wonderful fianc√©, and keep reminding myself that all this stress is worth the roughly $3-$4K I'll make doing it, which will provide enough financial help to get our first real apartment.

I have used drugs consistently since I was 18 years old, 46 now.  Mostly alcohol and weed but I have enjoyed blow, acid, mushrooms, pills both up and down as well as meth.  I had been Immune to addiction (at least physical addiction).  Then came oxycodone.  I came across a situation where I have an unlimited supply of 30mg roxys.  In the beginning I tried one and they made me sick.  I thought fuck these, you are puking and head spinning.  Who wants that?  Later I hurt my knee and took one and Presto, no more pain and a very nice buzz to boot.  Fast forward a year later and I was eating 3 to 4 a day and felt good about life.  I went on a vacation with a buddy and I knew we would have unlimited blow and weed so I left my pills at home.  Big mistake!!  The first night I thought the hotel bed sucked.  The second  night I thought it was food poisoning.  After I got home I ate one more little blue pill and suddenly all better.  That is when I knew.  I bit the fucking bullet and quit for about 4 months.  It sucked but fuck it if you cannot handle your high then  don't do drugs.  Of course I still have the unlimited supply of this drug.  So after 4 months of no pills  I give it another go and I'll be damned, I went on a month binge and withdrawals again to quit.  Since then I only chip as to make sure I do not have physical withdrawals.  I will probably maintain this manner of usage at least until I get a terminal diagnosis.  After that straight to the needle to see what all the hype is about.  I guess the moral of my story is I opened a door that cannot be shut.

Part two goes into most euphoric opioids.

Part one. I find heroin to be quite a bit like dilaudid in regards to rush, very clean head high, almost makes me feel dizzy, closest IV opioids to cocaine IV. Of course obviously the heroin high has longer legs. 


Oxymorphone seems much more like morphine, heavier body high, more pins and needles, almost painful tension around the neck and shoulders. Just wonder if anyone else experiences it this way. In this sense I almost feel like opana is overrated, with dilaudid and heroin having a better more euphoric high.

My understanding of the science is weak, but I would think the morphones would be more similar, and that Oxymorphone would be lighter and speedier than its codone sibling oxycodone. I would also expect heroin to be heavier like morphine, especially considering that's practically what it is, where instead it feels much cleaner and lighter like hydromorphone (it can't all come down to the 6 mam, can it?). Anyone with insight or speculation as to why this might be, id love to hear it. Also I'd love to hear if most others experience it this way, or if it's just my body's unique response to these drugs.

Part 2, obviously morphine, heroin, Oxymorphone and hydromorphone are probably considered the highest abuse potential opioids, due to the euphoria they generate. Does anyone know of any uncommon opioids, or think any will be discovered, with euphoria and abuse potential that would blow those big 4 out of the water, and make them seem like a child's play thing, kinda like how one would compare heroin to hydrocodone?",1466312682.0

So keep it short and simple, I beat my hands up nicely. Missed a few shots of cousrse in the binge. The wrist photo that is almost black and blue with the couple red specs is from me registering in those veins (hospital put an IV in there once Idk how that worked), but as soon as I pushed 2-3 units or littlest force it stung.

Otherwise the rest is just from me trying to locate a vein, or running to the bottom of the box of 100 and not replacing it till morning leaving me with some heavier damage / bruising.

The seeds were sown in high school and college, when I first experienced the joy of opiates from pilfered Vikes from parents/college roommates.  However, it really started with me ordering British OTC codeine online two years ago.  As a worker in the natural sciences, I should have known better...  I lived for science, but gradually realized my life had voids in it that science could not fill.  And this stuff made life a little more livable.  Soon I was downing 600 mg a day and codeine wasn‚Äôt cutting it.  Flash forward two years -- I‚Äôve now settled on PST and recently starting playing around with U4.  These days I wake up sweating and in pain and am barely functional without my tea at least twice a day.  I go through a 10 lb bag per week.  Today, I did 100 mg of U4 within an hour and had a close call with respect to respiratory depression.  I spent the afternoon puking and sleeping it off.  Later in the evening, I had to attend a work party, only to realize I was going into withdrawal after not dosing on tea for the day and had to make up an excuse to leave early.  (Evidently U4 has no legs, even in excess).

But no, I put it on the counter and press it with a coin and bam, I have a nice pile of beige powder probably weighing a quarter gram. I am elatef, stuff like this NEVER happens to me, I was so happy, I figured with my tolerance all the way down I could easily stretch it into 3 shots.

But then it sets in. The guilt. The apprehension. The motherfucking consideration of the long-term consequences of my motherfucking actions  I haven't been high in an eternity, I deserve to be able to have one night of fun.

But deep down, I knew it wouldn't just be one night. It is NEVER ""just one night."" If it had been, I wouldn't have becone a  dopefiend in the first place. So I threw it in the toilet before I could change my mind and do something stupid. I smoked a blunt and beat off, but I still feel like garbage, mentallly and physically. It's like being close to dope suddenly like that caused a psychosomatic reaction and I'm in withdrawals again, because I'm sweating like a pig and my body is all tingly. 

I'm writing this partly because I want to whine and bitch about how life isn't fair and other assorted spoiled-little-brat, wah-wah-wah shit. But I also want to demonstrate that this sobriety bullshit IS possible. I detoxed totally cold turkey with nothing but vitamins, exercise, the Good Lord's love and guidance, and a shitton of weed. I have ALWAYS had incredibly poor impulse control as a result of having ADHD, I have an obsessivr/addictive personality, and I first developed a physical dependence on opiates at age 17 completely by accident because I was in the hospital for 2 months after 4 of my vertebrae were crushed in an accident. I have several screws in ny spine and I'm in mild-to-moderate pain every second of the day. I'm not supposed to lift anything over 50 pounds, but I lift 5-6 times a week, which definitely exacerbates things. I'm telling you all this because, if I can string together a couple months of clean time and turn down free dope, I have supreme confidence that any one of you can do the same. I have zero self-control and I am a massive baby. If I can do this, literally anyone can. So if any of you are struggling or on the fence, I urge you to take the plunge. Give it a couple months, the dope isn't going anywhere, and I guarantee you won't be laying on your death bed saying ""I can't believe I wasted those months giving sobriety a try!"" And for those of you with no desire to quit, I hope that you're all having good weekends, you've got fire shit, and you're relaxing. I hope that you've managed to find a level of balance in your life while using, I certainly couldn't, and I applaud any and all of you who can. So wherever you are and whether you're clean, high, or god forbid withdrawing, I hope you're happy, and you're safe, and you're at peace

If I know I'm gonna have to re-use my rigs, I immediately thoroughly rinse them out, use rubbing alcohol/bleach if I have it, let it sit for a moment, rinse again with water, then set all the separate parts air dry until I cycle it back into use. Rinse and repeat until the exchange is open. Round here there's a 6 hour period once a week where you can swap out your gear. So like two weeks of this with 20 rigs. Sorry I'm rambling, unimportant details and debate-ably bad grammar/spelling. . On xanax and IV'd cocaine right now.

Anyway. I realized something was wrong (I'll occasionally have to re-use rigs every once in awhile but it's always been completely fine, this was obvious something was wrong). I went to the ER, they gave me some antibiotics, and told me it was mild cellulitis of my vein. They gave me 2 different antibiotics and one of them is actually a combo antibiotic, so like 3. That was yesterday. I'm already feeling a lot better, just a little fatigued. The swelling has gone down tremendously and it's not bright red anymore, just looks a little bruised.

My partner knows about my IV use, and is understanding. However we're worried it'll spread to him if we get it on (oooh yeah). The ONLY penetration would be me penetrating him with a condom. Is that safe for him? What about just hand or mouth stuff, would that be safe (what is this, high school?)?

Would we have to swap blood for him to get it, or could he get it from what I just wrote? Couldn't really find anything decisive on the internet.

just finished off about 2.5 grams of Fu-F over 6-7 days via IV. 

Leaving the remainder of the fent bags (have som 4-fibf I only tried 2-3 times and an extra fu-f bag from a different source) with my significant other tonight and embarking on the journey of each level of hell.

i have pretty much everything except for gabapentin and pregablin available to me..

i've never sucesfully used immodium, but i've only tried it once in the past. when i tried it, i didnt take a huge dose, it mgiht of been the pills with more then just loperamide, and I got super bloated and began puking a foul taste I'll never forget.

Also, I know about torsade de pointes/ sudden death and prolonged qt-interval because of methadone and other pharmaceuticals. As loperamide ultra high dose is cardiotoxic, I'm a bit anxious riden.

Kinda hoping someone can lay out some sort of dosing schedule and all....

My tolerance is literally 25-30mg IV fu-f 20-30 times a day. 

Last year I managed to raise my ace fent tolerance to 60mg, and then quit via methadone, something I am not willing to do again.

As this was only 5-6 days though I am noticing my withdrawal symptons arent as severe.

PS, dealing with some pains on my frnt left and front right going to the back, hopefully my organs are all fine. I was concerned about rhabdomyolysis but I've been drinking plenty peeing clear.

I have unlimited clonidine too. And some onandesteron. 

In my memory onanadesteron + gravol always helped alleviate the stomach a bit. But I remember clonidien seeming like a bunk ass sugar pill (even tastes like nothing) until one withdrawal I mega dosed. Literally took like 7-8 0.1mg pills at once. Got quite low BP, and wasn't really able to stand for long or get up quickly without orthostatic hypotension laying my ass back down. But I did effectively feel fatigued enough to sleep my brains off

Is it safe / legit of me to dose clonidine high again? I am thinking clondiine + benzos + some immodium + onanadesteron and marijuana would be an easy and readily available stack?

If I don't want to be crazy with the immodium and face potential cardiotoxciity, what's a dose that would be effective to some extent, but not be a full blown recerational opiod dose? I know this is very hard for anyone to answer as it is technically / does not (fuck I am not loperamide Ph.D lol)  cross the blood brain barrier.

worst case, I have a handful of 100mg morphines, and like 100 30mg morphines,

any idea redditors what type of dosing for these drugs would be sufficient to get me through the 47-96 hours of hell?

i know my gaba receptors are nice and fresh, I wa susing a valium every 48-72 hoiurs (just 10mg) prior to this week long binge, so at this point I am in some mild benzo withdrawal and know my next dose will hit very nice. benzos available are  alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam",1466298075.0

So yesterday she said she was going to kick me out, but we talked a little bit and I was able to sleep at home one more night. She thought over that night and gave me the ultimatum: I can leave to where I was originally planning to go (My Grandmother's in Oregon) without my car, or go to an inpatient rehab. I chose the latter because I am honestly ready to get clean after the whole situation with my love of my life. She let me get another 20 sack today, she was reluctant but the inpatient I am going to admissions' person said to do it, which is weird I think but I digress. I got 3 points and am ready for this to be my last sack and move on to a sober life. I figure I would share with my bropiates since I probably won't be around/posting much.

My situation is this my mom, my father, my sister,step bro, cousins, and all my friends are also heroin addicts. However my mom, sister and father depend on me to get them dope everyday which I've done reluctantly because I know what dope sickness feels like. About 2 months ago I am leaving the projects for the second time that day as I had already got myself well and plus some for the day but my dad was sick and wanted something so I went for him.. When walking out task force jumps on me and I'm caught with a little bit of dope ..more than a normal using amount. So now I am looking at felony charges and what has been amazing to me is how my family I went back in for that day has turned on me.. The county sent me to rehab and the day I got home on the 26th of last month I get told how I fucked them and they couldn't get what they wanted while I was gone and I'm a basic piece of shit for trying to get help, mind you this is as soon as I walked in the door from rehab. So I also come to find out my dad who I basically took a charge for has went to our shared job told them I'm a heroin addict, that I was arrested, and all kinds of other stuff.. On top of this he has told everyone in town including talking loudly at the local convenient store about how I always have a needle in my arm and this and that without knowing my friend is in the store and heard him. After hearing all this I felt betrayed plus the fact I have guilt that I am the one who gets it for them, the fact my own mother asks me to shoot her up daily, and I am just generally not feeling good about myself.. 

So I started to use again about 2 weeks ago after I found out that the county had put a warrant out for me while in rehab because I had court even though they told me it was pushed back because I was in there... They told me I have to sit 3 days to see a judge plus after that I can sit 72hrs to be released..so I did what they wanted me to and the right thing but they are going to punish me for it by making me sit in jail for around 5/6 days. I honestly said fuck it ... When I use I go a little harder than most like I see what alot of user on here use daily and think I wish that was my problem, or I hear I was using 5 bags a day..shit id walk off 5 bags a day.. I am pretty much back to shooting crazy amounts of dope/coke everyday cause I won't do just dope alone as it doesn't satisfy me.. I feel like I'm all alone and I'm only good for anybody when I am getting them dope or doing them a favor. My father has yet to come see me or talk to me since I've been home from rehab other than asking me to get him dope once. I am unsure what to do at this point as it seems everything goes bad for me.",1466402024.0

I managed to get down to 4 30mg Roxi per day and j should have used that as a point to keep going down but of course I didn't. 

So now my tolerance shot back up to around 10-11 per day and sometimes a 60mg OP chewed up in there somewhere. And I am not going to buy any more since I can't really afford it anyway, so I picked up some lopermide and couldn't find any Quinine which I read is helpful with it but it seems to have been banned by FDA. Also have 2 subs laying around which I know isn't much but the more the merrier. 

First question is if I take lopermide in the morning and for some reason it doesn't work for me like I hope, can I still take the sub late tomorrow night?  I want to make sure the ""lope"", in its opiate-like properties, won't throw me into precipWD if I take the sub after taking lope.

2nd question. Lope dosage?? I'd prefer to have the lope be my answer because easier for me to acquire and dropping 3-5 pills per day will probably be easier then trying to cut down the strips of sub, plus I wasn't too crazy about how the sub made me feel when I took it before, mostly tired and headaches. So knowing my daily intake of Oxy is around 270mg-330mg per day, what dosage of lope would you recommend, when to take and how often. Also is there anything I should take with it like vitamin C, zantac?

I've yet to decide if once the 30 days is up if I'm gonna just keep at it, just use every now and again, or belly flop right back to a .5- 1.0 or more a day habit. 

Obviously, I'm not going to do a lot the first time due to not knowing just how much, if any at all, my tolerance lowered. This ""break"" so to speak has been rather easy tho... it's weird, at least IME, I've had some times where I've kicked for a short time and it's like I never did any drugs and other times I've kicked and it's some of the worse feelings I've ever felt in my life... I can only hope the ""big kick"" when I *DO* finally stop for good will one of the easy times.

But, enough about that and on to my question for once I delve back into the world of the walking dead ;D I'm sure it varies depending on what state you're in (IL here) but, say you're walking around town and a cop was to search you (I'm on felony probation so they're completely within their rights to do so) can you still be charged with paraphernalia if the rig has been cleaned out of all blood and drug residue and the needle broken off and safely disposed of? I mean technically at that point it can't be used for IV drug use and in turn isn't paraphernalia anymore right? It's just a barrel and a plunger and IMHO no more than an oral syringe at that point... opinions? Experiencs? Thanks 

TL;DR: Im over 2 weeks clean. And can a rig with no needle and no biological evidence in it still catch you a paraphernalia charge? ",1466390175.0

I'm an occasional user of opiates/opioids for a few years now.

Here and there I enjoy 3-4 days binges followed by fairly large breaks in between, in order to maintain my tolerance low.

What I have found lately is that whenever i start a binge, either by codeine, heroin, oxy, fent-derivates, you name it; The first and second day I get really high and itchy as hell.

However in the 3rd/4th day I don't get any itch at all and still get high as fuck.

Do you guys have the same reaction? Is it some kind of histamine adjustment of my body?

I find it strange since it's only been happening lately, in earlier days I'd get itchy the whole time, literally had to take a fair amount of Hydroxyzine to support the itchiness (and to be frank, the pair synergizes quite well).

Does anyone has an explanation to it? I find it strange since I can get really high with the same doses but without the itch. 

Anyone else has the same experience?

I'm thinking back, and every time I've been in my most absolute despair, something random has helped. May it be a bath, or a walk, or benzo, or mega dosing clonidine, I have seen light in those dark dark moments.

What has helped you? Am I the only one who finds since day one withdrawals manifest extremely psychological? To the point, my vision looks gloomy. Everything feels dead around me. It is like I have entered a apocalyptic dystopian reality. 

Funnily enough, Im one of those people who rarely vomits or shits themself in withdrawals, yes, my bowels loosen up and I use the washroom, but I've only ever had one binge where I vomitted at the end and I think it was just cut and the dope itself.

The way some people have nutritional deficiencies even though they eat well - because their body has problems absorbing nutrients. Just wondering what you think about this.

I can't snort as I have many problems with my nose due to multiple fractures, I don't even breathe through my nose anymore.

I'm not interested in IV-ing or plugging. I guess I don't mind waiting for the oxy to kick in. I'm just curious whether any of you have experienced something similar and/or you think it may be to do with my body having problems absorbing the oxycodone.

This question will have no doubt been asked before but I couldn't find previous answers so am asking anyway.

I never feel a need to take oxycodone. I just sonetimes use it as a distraction from feeling depressed.

It never makes me feel happy or euphoric. It just makes me drowsy and so less aware of my sad thoughts.

I've always felt this way. You know how hard it is to get motivated to do anything right? Well, as you grow older, the one thing you realise is that you cannot sit around until you feel motivated. You cannot wait for that flash of inspiration to come in order to do something; but this is something that people just never learn. You just have to do it no matter how miserable you are. Here lies the Crux of it all.
Opiates teach you this in a very real way -you see the importance of time when you're addicted, and you know that if you don't have the cash for your next fix then you're dead. 
This is why you fucking bust your ass no matter how fucking well or unwell you are and you keep working until you have the cash for your next fix. This is where opiates can make you. This is what made Dave Mustaine who he is today. But there is a flipside: if you fall behind the same opiates will break you and you'll surely be dead. This is why I think of opiates like making a deal with the devil, it's like a coach and it keeps you going harder than you ever you thought you could go.

For the original thread. Bruises are beginning to heal, just the hand hurts like hell where i jabbed the one very solid reliable vein like 30 times in two days, never had used it prior to then, a juciy new gatway I found..

Anyway as per my original thread, I did my ""last shot"" of fu fent at 12:30 or 1 pmish yesterday, which is now 34 hours later. I was using heroin IV (0.25g strong quarter g held me over a few hours, beter then 40mg opana iv surprisingly) but I used in the 34 hours 1.1 gram of tar and 0.15 g of 4, 0.13g of 3, and 50mg opana iv + 24mg hydromorphone iv (pills didnt do much at all :/), no rush from anything, but it made gtting through the peak much much better.

Now I woke up in such bad withdrawals I didn't have the thoght or energy to go downstars and search the boxes and stash area for morphine pills or an oxy to swallow. So my dumb ass went and shot fu-fent, I put about 1/2 or less then what my usual size shots had been at the end, and it got me fuked at the moment.

Not going to dose more, but I hope this hasn't set me back too much. What do you guys think? Tommorow I get 2 grams of uncut 90%+ heroin from  a darknet vendor who ships south east uncut from the source country, so I'l be abel to use that for the next 48 hours and I hope then the fent wds are fully done. 

I hope this isn't going to set me back to hour 0, or anything. I was trying more to lower my tolerance back to my original dose of 200-300 mg mscontin for pain, and maintence (dont expect or get small pupils or high, just analgesia and normal), the fact that half the fu fent works and that today the last shot of black tar I waited 8 hours to do when I was really sick actually constricted my pupils a lot and it was only a quarter gram (I know that's a lot and i mnot familiar with tar but I understand that seems to be not that much, considering when I was expecting having to take truckfulls.)


PS, yeah, it was probably stuppdi to leave myself with am emergency 100mg, but I figured god forbid something insane happend and the life of me broke, I didnt want to be calling my s/o whos out of town to drive a few hours to bring me it lmao

anyway, I was just curious why tapering doesn't work. If you need x-units of dope, just to avoid feeling sick, why can't you lessen it by gradually reducing it to x-1 daily units, or even 9/10ths as much per day, go a week or two at that dose, then reduce it by just a tiny bit more ? It seems like this way you wouldn't have to fear withdrawal, and all you would have to concentrate on is managing at a steady level (i.e. just concentrate on feeling ""normal"" and use any remaining willpower to avoid trying to get high).

I know tapering doesn't work, but logically it seems like it would. So I just wanted to ask why that is. Best of luck to all of you. ",1466485455.0

Lana has spent the last hour talking down to Thomas and myself.  Basically berating our existence and just being crazy as she always did but today was different. Today I was dope sick and not in the mood for her shit. 

   Earlier I'd walked my drug deprived body up to this hell hole known as Llittle Skeezers and extracted my measly check from the hands of the same nappy headed viper. I ran to the Publix next door and cashed out my $183. Clammy hands unlock my phone and frantically dial the one person who could get me well. Clone.

I laughed as well. His vernacular always seemed to crack me up because he's so hood and I'm so white. Him being a seventeen year old black high school kid me a twenty two year old white GED recipient junkie didn't really matter much to this place but we liked to talk anyways. I was getting close though.

  ""Man who is you talking to like that? Thomas says while turning to face her. "" You need to lose the attitude 'fore I come over there an slap da fiii outcho ass!""

  ""And I don't appreciate the vulgar language! I'm A Christian!"" I said. I'm not but I said it anyways. My phone start ringing violently in my pocket while she yells some more curses. ""Fuck this I'm going outside to smoke."" 

I step out the door and answer my phone.

""Bud(the owner) said after tonight your suspended for the week for taking so many smoke breaks"" She says with a smile. 

I proceed to take off my apron and hand it to her.  

   ""I quit. You can shove that suspension up your ass but thanks anyways."" I walk to the front and grab some cheesy bread and a thin crust pizza they were cooking for the crew. ""Fuck you. I'm out.""

I made it about twenty feet and I hear the door open behind me expecting it to be her for some reason, but I look back and Thomas comes running out after me. 

  ""Hey you still wanna match it up?"" He says. 

 ""Yeah. I'm guessing you quit too?""

  ""Hell yeah bruh!""

   We get to my house and proceed to get high as fuck and eat all this pizza and I completely forget about my dope sickness. I'm eating a slice of pizza and my phone buzzes for incoming text.

 Clone: Be careful. Better than last time.

  ""Oh shit. I have dope!"" I think to myself. ""I'm about to go change real quick."" I tell T.

I go to my room close the door and produce my kit. I extract a half of a point and blast off. I feel the rush coming and I put away my rig and such. I get up to open my bedroom door and then. Darkness. I come too with Thomas yelling at me. And then feel my body being pulled backwards threw my front door. 

""You gone be alright man!"" He yells at me. ""Ambulance on it's way!""

""Nah, I'm good dude."" I slur.

""Nah man you fell out."" He says now facing me as two emts pull up. 

  ""What happened?"" Emt one asks while he puts a blood pressure cuff on me. I'm still do dazed to resist. 

""He gasped real loud and hit the ground and when I found him he was blue."" T said back. 

"" I need water. Ice water."" I said while nodding. Thomas goes inside and gets some and gives me the glass. I drink half and regain some awareness along with the puke sensation so I jump up and puke in my trash can. Instantly I regain awareness. They ask Thomas if he can get my wallet. While he's inside I decide to speak up.

""I did heroin that's why I fell out."" I tell the Emt.

""Well that helps a whole lot. Thank you for being honest. Do you still want to go to the hospital?""

""I do not."" I say as I begin to like again.

They leave after a little while longer and my mom shows up and does her best to care for me in my royally fucked up state. the next day she ask me what I was on and I lie but she knows.

  ""You've got to do something different. You can't keep living your life this way. Smokescigarettes, you can do better than this.""

  ""Okay"" I say while looking down. ""I'll try mom. 

So I'm sitting around and surfing craigslist when I see this add that says get paid to travel and have fun! I read up on it and it turns out to be a traveling carnival and I've always thought it would be so cool to be a carnival worker.  I call the number expecting some gruff sounding dude and a sweet voiced lady named Lacey answered. We talked for a little bit and told me to come to this not so great side of town where they are set up.

    I go there skeptically and I start walking around and I get that happy feeling/sense of wonderment that carnivals an fair have invoked in me since I was a tot. I ended up waiting around at the bumper cars and I met one of my soon to be friends Tish. I interviewed with Lacey and her bf Clint and they told me to be ready tomorrow. I was super nervous and packed everything I could think of that I would need and still didn't half of what I actually would need. But I met them at the same place the next day after they tore down and left with them. I met Clint's son Mike who I really didn't like. He was a 17 year old Florida kid who had a loud truck and thought he knew everything. I was honestly nervous about meeting people because I didn't think I'd meet anyone like minded or close in age but my first day on the lot I met this 27 year old dude named Tony who looked like a young Bradley Cooper. He started the day before me and we ended up being best friends.

I was looking at the top post, which is currently a shopped picture of some stamps on a unicycle. Since Amazon and other stores are developing drone delivery of their products, why don't we!?

Of course this would have to involve trust of your local dboy to fly your dope over to you after being paid, but how cool would it be to have your dope dropped form the heavens. 

You text your drone piloting dboy and see if he's good for a bundle/gram/what-have-you. You then send your location using a smart phone and either use Square or some other instant payment method(bitcoin!), or wait for the drone to come by with a little pouch attached to hold your money. You plop the benjamins into the drone sack/clip, having seen the money via webcam, the dboy pilots his drone back to his spot and counts your funds. He then weighs out your bag, puts it in the drone sack and flies it directly to you.

High above the streets, it would avoid other junkies, surveillance cameras, the police and anything else that would hinder your product from reaching you.

There are of course pitfalls to this plan. Bad weather, poor range (uses LTE/4G maybe?), prohibitive cost, FCC licensing, hacking or just plain shooting the damn thing out of the air... and although you're not letting your money walk, you'd be letting it fly-- but this wouldn't be for the low end fucktard dealer we're all used to, this method would be for the elite, well to do dboy.

What do you think? If you trusted your dealer or otherwise knew he was all about stacking paper and customer service, would you be down for drone delivered dope to become the norm? It protects both buyer and seller and tbh is pretty fucking cool to get air dropped dope. What other futuristic methods do you hope arise? Will we be printing out or making our own dope at home any time soon?

I'd get hired to pilot a dope drone and serve people all day in a SECOND! Anyway, I'm feeling much better now, scored some BTH on my lunch break and got a shitty norco rx to pick up after work. ",1466460311.0

I recently purchased some micron filters, I have two kinds, one bigger wheel filter (better for pills I suppose) and a smaller one. Both are made for using them with a luer lock syringe.

I know there are many guides about micron filters on the internet but they are mostly all about pills. So is it even useful / advised to filter heroin (#3 in my case) through a micron filter for single shots, without making a bigger solution?

Why I'm asking is because to me it seems a bit complicated. 

For example: They are made to filter a solution that's already in a syringe and don't work both ways (right?). 

So I have to (if we're doing it completely right and sterile)

1) Draw up some water without filter, put the filter on the syringe and push the water through it in order to make it wet so it won't suck up too much of my heroin solution

2) Cook up my shot, draw it into a syringe, put the filter on it, push the solution through it

3) Use a new syringe (because of the unfiltered content in the one I used before) and a new needle to finally draw up my solution to inject?

Sorry for my complicated description, I hope you get what I wanted to explain. If it was possible to use the filters in both ways, e.g. draw the solution up through it into the syringe, I could use the same syringe to inject.

Sure, that's a bit over cautious because the syringe you are using to filter will be almost completely empty but it isn't 'perfect'

Thank you for any advice and maybe you can clarify some of my assumptions as wrong.

Went to the local e.r. and was admitted for surgery to remove it. It's now been atleast 5 months and everything has healed up pretty well but I'm just starting to notice something a little off.. It started a few days ago when I noticed a small bump protruding from the center of my scar.. I started poking around and realized there is something under my skin. When I push down on the bump that is sticking up I can see the other end of an inch long peice of hard plastic or rubber (idk wth it is)start pushing up against my skin. It hasnt caused much pain or discomfort further then having something under the skin but as I have a very physical job I could see it becoming a problem in the future. Is anyone familiar with the process of abscess removal and have any idea wtf could be left in my arm that fits the description?

Potency? As if not more potent mg per mg then 4 i've been getting 

Effects / thoughts? amazing rush, amazingly pleasant calm peaceful relaxing high.


I know different tar will be very different but these two higher grades of tar really were nice for me, and managed to break through and help an addiction to furanyl fentanyl.

#3, I hnever found anything special or unique about 3 except needing vit c and generally not being very good or potent except a few times.

So will I only buy tar from now on? Absolutely not. I need to research if wheel filteirng them makes it slightly more healthy and safe or if the stuff is just caustic poison no matter what.

""...yeah, I mean, it isn't always easy to get. I don't think. I don't know honestly. Really, I like crack. I just came across the smack, on accident. It really wasn't that great man..""

""Oh coo!. I will hit you up when I get down there.""
Yeah. Who soberly decides to go buy crack or heroin, I ask myself.

The day comes, and he calls like I knew he would. I direct him to my place.

""This is my liquor cabinet. Drink anything but the scotch. Dont drink the 151 in the freezer. Its green for a reason. Actually, we are probably going to hit it anyway - let's just start there. Its phenazepam, it takes a while to hit you. Not real euphoric,, its either mild or a two day blackout. No in between. Let me remind you, this is how trouble starts""

An hour later..

""Yeah man, I've always wanted to try smack. But like, it just doesn't exist back home.""
I can tell the phenaz is working. I nod, trying to show I'm listening when I'm really not. Im cutting up bumps of MXE for us, because why not?

Later -

""How far is it?"" He asks.

""I don't know dude, there's no heroin store. I just found it where I buy crack. Its up this way a few blocks.""

""Oh, so youre pretty sure they will have something?""

""... Yeah man, its what they do. They sell drugs.""

""On the street?""

"".. Yes.. On the street.""

We walk up, and I have to stop him from talking to crack heads and hustlers. Thus is one of my daily bus stops, I know how to act here. He is obviously new to this though.

""Yeah what you need?"" A young entrepreneur asks as I come to a stop before him.

""Uh.. Two dubs of work, dub of down."" We talk a little to find he only has crack. Whatever. 

He's wearing the colors for this neighborhood, I know he's either affiliated or nuts. He puts his hand out, and I put mine out with the money. He swipes the cash, and starts walking away. Oh fuck.

I follow him around the corner but he's in a dead run already. And we are burnt. Fuck. Why'd he say he only had work? I don't get it. To scam us less?

""FUCK!"" Bellows drizzle. His deep voice booming down the street as he kicks the side of a bus shelter. Its plexiglass wall shuddering and shaking against his fury. Phenazepam is working.

""Dude, shit, you wanna come get high with me or go to jail?""

""That was fourty bucks dude!""

""Shit happens out here.""

""Naw, noibody fucks with my money!""

""He JUST did! Its over! Let's move on.""

""Grumble grumble grumble.""

Block later I find the real corner boys.

""Dude wait here.""

""I need two dubs of work.""

""Here.""

""Thanks.""

As I return, ""did you get h?""

""Naw dude they were out!""

""Really?!""

""Yeah, shit. Oh well. We got some rock though.""

""I really wanted h.. Is crack fun?""

They gave me some shit I aint never seen before an 1802 then they were gonna transfer me from ER to state facility to VA vacility but then I lucked out and finally sobered up. after 14 days awake with vary little food and some water my mind became a hell on earth.

 My wife and me split up on the first of this month and thats when i started going hard on the crank. somewhere towards the end of this binge I lost it. I started screaming at the top of my lungs that my wife was dying in our house (she wasnt there and my neighboor knew so) I could hear her dying and I couldnt find my glassess so I couldnt find her so I just started running by the house screaming about her being stuck under the couch eventually the cops came out and told me I either accepted the fact that this shit was not real or they were gonna take me into jail I got super lucky they gave me that option.

 I entually calmed down so they left. Then I barricaded my door because I then thought the cops were there to get me for being involved in robbing a bank. I halucinated a whole stand off with the bank robbers about to kill me and for some reason they used me to broker a deal with the PD and after the whole thing was done it was my time to come out of the house cause they had already disarmed the robbers. Shortly after that I laid down on the concrete that had been baking in the California summer sun with my hands behind my back like I was being arrested. I guess I laid there for quite some time cause when the neighbor found me I was half dead from sun stroke and when I woke up a day later in the psych unit the skin on the inside of my arms and on my chin were scorched red from being burnt on the concrete. 

There was alot more weird as fuck hallucinations once i got to the hospital like after I got to the prison for being implicated as the ring leader of the bank robbers ( they turned on me because I helped the police negotiate a non violent resolution so they framed me as the crazed lunatic leader of some redneck militia who robbed banks ) I had a stroke and had to be taken by ambulance to a hospital at which point I became a parapalegic that a group of students Euthanized.

There where more before that I just dont remember them as vividly as the final act of my Icarus routine. 

It took me my entire stay in the psych ward to comprehend what I had saw and then up untill now to actually flesh out what happened. My brain has still not fullly recovered (im not sure it ever will?)

My bi-polar mother from Hawaii has been planning on coming out and visiting me for a month.  She's totally crazy & abusive (during my childhood, I haven't seen her since I was 18)  The last time I saw her was at my little sister's funeral...


ANYWAYS I quit dope cause I didn't want to be using when she was here.  I switched onto subs & it was fine.  I have 15 days since I last shot dope.  However I did buy 100 bars of xanax for her visit.  Knowing it would extremely stressful.  


*First day we see them it's no problem.  Smoke some weed.  Go out to dinner.  Watch a movie at their hotel.*  The second day (friday) I remember the first part of...we went hiking and my boyfriend & I kept redosing the xanax....the thing *it was that it's powder xanax so it's hard to measure out exactly.*


Last thing I remember is walking back to the car.  *Apparently we went to a mall and I stole a sick pair of black sherry topsiders and a MK purse.*  Next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital and them telling me that I OD'd and it had been a day.  As soon I woke up they took me on an hour long ambulance ride to a mental ward.  *Apparently I had told the nurse if I had been trying to kill myself than I'd be dead*  

Trust me you do not want to be in a mental ward.  It's better than jail but it still sucks dick.  They told me they would have subs but they were all out so I flipped out and they gave me a shot of ativan in each butt cheek and told me they go find me some.  They turned off the light I was like "" Hey, I don't want to fall asleep before you come back..""  And she said that was the point.  LOL


*MORAL OF THE STORY: DON'T GET BARRED OUT AND THEN 5150'd*

Recently, I managed to get a steady supply of 10mg percs for really, really cheap - this means I was doing a LOT of them and doing CWE's 2 or 3 times a day.

That said, when I ran out, the WD""s came on HARD.
Lope wasn't touching it so I thought about the used filters.

I separated the filters from the pill material, washed the filters, wrung them out and drank.

Then I took the pill material and using a small amount of water, re-dissolved it and filtered the usual way and drank it.

I was cautious because the material I was working with was, potentially a fatal dose of APAP and, originally, was roughly 4 or 500 mg of oxy.

It's been speculated that you lose a pill +/- when you do CWE's which was the hope. I was washing about 5 or 6 filters so I was hoping for a dose in the 5 or 6 pill range...

...I was wrong. If I had to guess it was closer to 8 or more because I was *ripped*. This was really good but draws into question my CWE process which is as follows:

I just crush (or let sit if I have time and aren't in a rush) the pills in the bottom of a glass and add water. The amount of water is hard to estimate. I don't use much. I'm not making paste or anything but not a whole lot more than that. It's fully liquified, nowhere near pasty.

My reasoning for this is that only so much APAP can dissolve into the water. More water == more apap in solution. I'm pretty sure it doesn't take much water to dissolve the oxycodone content of 6 pills into it.At least I wouldn't think but if anyone knows something I don't please lay it on me.

After dissolving, I just wet a filter, lay it over another glass, push down into it making a little bowl and pour in the slop. Then I fold up the sides and twist the top and gently squeeze out the water - as much as possible.

Then I drink.

Clearly there is going to be opiate in the remaining moisture in the filter and the pill material but the assumption was that it wasn't much (maybe a pills worth as speculated) but in this case it seems it was quite a bit more.

Can anyone shed light on a better CWE method? I'm not a fan of dissolving the pills in hot water then cooling to precipitate out the apap. I don't feel it's necessary. Using initially cold water should do the same thing by virtue of not allowing the apap to dissolve into it to begin with, right?

I know there has to be a fool-proof, measured, regimented way to do this yielding clean water with maximum oxy and minimum apap.

The reason I ask is because if you already have some bupe in your system, it's hard to go by the gauge of whether or not you're in full withdrawal when the time comes to take your next dose. I would imagine if bupe has a half life of around 37 hours, and dope barely a third of that, that as long as you've waited at least 8 to 10 hours you should have more bupe filling your receptors than dope, therefore negating the pwd issue.

   Anyways, back to why I'm here. I am 22 years old and I've been off dope for a little more than a year. I've been on suboxone during this time. I've had a couple slips here and there, the longest one lasting maybe up to 5 days, but I always got back on my subs. During this time as well, I've used various different drugs. Mainly, weed and xanax, but occasionally coke and adderall as well. 

   With that said, the last week of May, and the first week of June I was completely blacked out during that entire time on xanax. I got a really good deal and had 50 bars in my possession. I remember bits and pieces. I lost my job as a server because I went into work obviously fucked up, and was an awful server for the 30 minutes I worked... I was falling asleep at one of the computers to put an order in is when I was asked if I was okay by a manager to which I said, ""You know what, I'll tell you the truth... I'm on heroin...but it's okay cause I'm going to rehab."" That's when he said, ""okay we'll I think it's best if we have you go.""  And then I said , ""Oh, it's okay though because I'm going to outpatient so I'll still be able to work weekends."" He said, ""No I think it's best if we let you go."" Like what the fuck, why did I say that??? I wasn't even on dope, i know xanax isn't any better, but I could've came up with a better lie than, ""IM ON HEROIN."" WTF

   So now, I've been clean from everything except subs for the past two weeks, and I'm currently jobless. I have no idea on how to get another job... Do I put that job on my resume? I worked there for 8 months, and was an excellent server except that one fuck up. I feel so hopeless right now, and I'm not sure what to do. I can use some words of encouragement and actual help if y'all can. This community is so great. Thank you so much guys. 

Edit: I guess I'm just looking for job suggestions, what to write on my resume, If I should call my old job to tell them what actually happened(no thanks), I just don't know what I'm doing. I didn't know what I was doing with a job, but now I feel really hopeless in what I'm doing in life. I want to give up.

I'm not looking for a rush, but just enough to work. I do this with stims aswell, I used to be somewhat addicted to stim rushes (cocaine, EPH, A-php) but now I only use racemic amphetamine powder.

Better than any pot or coke or pill dealer I've had the displeasure of dealing with. Today cemented my love for him.

The wifey and I  hit him up late afternoon for a brick and he said he only had one bun left but was do for a re-up if I wanted to wait. So I scored a little something something from my neighbor since I was sweating buckets from the oncoming withdrawal. Of course he texted me as soon as the money changed hands and said to arrive promptly at 7:30. So the missus and I saddle up and arrive at 7:31, but he isn't answering. Despite how common this is in our walk of life this is rather uncharacteristic of him. And my phone is dying. After 15 minutes of panicking I get a text on my broken ass phone saying come by in ten minutes and my phone promtly dies before I can even finish reading it. We get some coffee and arrive unannounced (which he hates). Not even mad he invites me inside and tells me to get my girl from out the car since his dude said ""he's just around the corner."" It was kind of comforting to know he has to deal with that sort of shit to. He pops on some Eastbound and Down and we shoot the shit a little. This is where my respect and love for him started to blossom. 

After like half an hour he apologizes for the wait and gives me a .3 of some molly he has for the inconvenience. Fuck yeah. He gave me a sample of some a few months back and it was damn good, not to mention its my wifes favorite drug and our E/molly dealer just moved. Watch more TV and an hour and a half has passed and now his dealers phone is off after saying he was ten minutes away, 90 minutes ago. We panic, get mad, and debate whether he got arrested or not. 

At the two hour mark my girl asks if we should just split and do what we got earlier and come by tomorrow. And voila, his dude says he is right around the corner. But! He actually is. I give him my cash and let it walk and boom, less than five minutes later he hands me my brick. With an extra 5 stamps for the wait.
 
But wait! There's more! He saw how broken down my phone was (cracked/shattered screen I can barely read)and gave me an old droid of his he hasn't used to activate and replace my busted one. My man! 

In all seriousness despite all the freebies he is a really good guy. Prompt, friendly, and all about business. It probably helps that my wife and I don't act like fiends with him, respect his time, and are good loyal customers. And shit, I'd hang around an extra two hours watching TV every single time if it meant some free molly, extra bags, and a free phone upgrade.

Despite the anxiety and stress I originally felt with my phone dying and waiting it turned out to be a damn good day. I hope the rest of you had at least a decent day full of happy nods. 

TL;DR - My dboy's dboy was 2 hours later then he said he would be, so my dboy gave me some free molly, an extra half a bun, and a free phone to replace my busted one for the inconvenience.",1466668330.0

Recently things have been getting worse and I've been using a largish stash of Fentanyl powder I have.


One or two times I've felt scared by taking more fent than I meant to or after letting my tolerance lower through partial withdrawl. My addiction and the profession I'm in means I can't get help from the usual services in the UK (they don't seem to be aimed at least part-functioning addicts anyway).


Can anyone recommend how to get hold of Naloxone, ideally the Narcan nasal spray? I know it's available through the various treatment programs we have in the UK (which do seem good) but just by entering one of these I would lose my job and destroy my career I've spent my whole life working for. I live with a close friend who I think I can trust to check on me and administer should my fears come true.


I know I am privileged and my fears must sound petty compared to many of you in this forum but I'm really scared and I don't know what else to do. It's nearly 3am here (I stay up late so I have longer to get high before work in the morning) so I may not be able to answer any questions for a day or so.


Any and all questions, advice and suggestions are welcome. From the little I've seen of this forum you are good people. Please help me I'm really really scared.


Note to mods: I don't believe this counts as sourcing as drug abusers are allowed to possess Naloxone in the UK due to a change in the law in 2015 (see http://www.naloxone.org.uk/index.php/lawpolicy/law/uklaw1)

&nbsp;

Edit: I've stayed up doing some more research and [this site](http://www.naloxone-hydrochloride.com/) seems to have exactly what I was asking for. Does anyone have any have any experience with them? I wonder if they would ship to the UK or I'd get busted whene they discovered it at customs. They're based in New York so not the sketchiest location for a parcel to come from. Again, anyone with even the vaguest idea would be much appreicated. Thanks to everyone, not long until I have to leave for work now :(

Edit 2: Just saw the sidebar link for ""Find Narcan and Needle Exchanges""... but it's for North America only :( If I ever do work out how to get Narcan in London (or UK generally) I'll let the mods know so they can update :)

For instance, a friend of mine from out of town cops in my city since, my town is essentially where you go to cop. My town is the shitty taint of the county and it's just an accepted fact by the locals; everyone comes here to get their shit.

So we meet up, and we talk aboutbullshit to pass the time, or should I say, Dealer Time, 'cause 20 minutes turned into an hour, and you know how it goes. So we're used to it and it's no biggie. This is part of my point though. 
We were able to chill and talk about whatever, we both just knew it would be a lot longer than ""20 min fam"". And we chilled and talked.
And as soon as we copped, literally the very moment we both got what we needed, we shared a brief hug and our goodbyes in less than 30 seconds. All towards the ultimate goal to fill our veins with this heavenly mud

We both understood that ""20 min"" could easily turn into an hour or longer, so by chilling we made it go by a bit faster, and we both acknowledged our mutual desire to get the narcotics into our veins as soon as humanly possible and made our good-byes extremely brief. Even though I, a young mid-20's male, and she a 40's-50's suburban mother and wife with an office job, come from two entirely different walks of life, we were brought together and we understand eachother's addiction, the culture, and the processes you have to work through in order to finally get to that sweet release. 

The whole mingling of people vastly different walks of life connected by the stigmatized sub-culture of drug use and illegal activity, and the fact that we're both on the same exact page when it comes to drugs, it's all really complex with it's intricacies and peculiarities and it's remarkable to realize the depth of both contrasts and where we're the same.

So...I've been using for quite a long time now. My peak habit has been a bundle a day for most of my time using, with short stints of using Suboxone to ween down...Then inevitably, when I got down to .5 mg or a couple days clean I would jump back on the junk. So here's the thing, I noticed that every time I would do the suboxone weening it would be less effective every time (at least that's how it felt). It's especially annoying with the current stuff I'm using because I think it has a long half life (reason for thinking that being  I took subs and had waited the same amount of time I had always had before, and it had never been a problem. This last time I went into precipitated withdrawl). 

So it's come time again that I need to try to get off of the stuff, if at least to save a little money. I really don't want to try to do this suboxone shit again if there is something else that might work better. I need some advice on Kratom and if anyone thinks it will work for me. My concerns are that I always only have one day off, never two in a row (though, I do have two days off a week). On top of that, I work in the service industry, so I have to be on my feet and talking to people, which means being sick is something I can't afford. I need to feel normal, and most preferably good. Now I will say this, I have had no problem weening off of anything other than dope.

So what do you guys think? Any suggestion/recommendations?
It would be much appreciated.  ",1466634352.0

He was just yelling incoherently and throwing things. Eventually we got him to tell us what was wrong and he said he wanted ""his pill."" So she gave it to him and everything was fine. 
After he calmed down, I asked him if his mouth was hurting and if that was why he threw such a fit. He said ""No. I just like my medicine because it makes me feel perfect.""

I've never related to a 6 year old so much before. I really hope that kid stays away from opiates in the future. ",1466630505.0
4pctfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4pctfx/want_to_quit_pstwhats_withdrawal_like/,18,https://redd.it/4pctfx,Nondescript_typical,Want to quit PST-What's withdrawal like?,"I started messing around with poppy seed tea about a year ago due to some chronic pain issues and also because I am an idiot. 

Now I feel like it's messing up my life and I just have a bad feeling about it so I need to quit. 

Is this something I could get through in like 3 or 4 days? Right now I'm using 6 oz of seeds everyday. 

The meds I'd have access to for my WD are tramadol, gabapentin, loperamide and Etizolam. 

Is there a legal drug that helps with the shivering and sweating symptom? Because I can't deal with that. It's the worst part of it for me. Is that what Kratom is supposed to help with? Or will tramadol kind of help with that? 

I was hoping maybe I could take my last dose on a Thursday evening, go to work Friday and withdraw over a 3 day weekend and be back at work the following Tuesday. Is that reasonable? As far as physical withdrawal symptoms go? 

I can work when I'm tired and queasy and unmotivated but not if I'm shaking and sweating and freezing. 

Seriously if it was just shitting my pants and puking I think I could handle it but the constant sweating and freezing and never being able to get dry is the big deterrent for me as far as stopping. 

But it's also the reason I want to quit because I can tell when the tea is wearing off by the fact that I'll be sitting in a 72 degree room doing nothing and suddenly rivers of sweat will start streaming down my head and soaking my shirt.  And the time between doses is getting shorter and shorter. Pretty soon I'll just be a big ole slimy mess whether I'm drinking the shit or not. Might as well quit. ",1466626996.0
4pcgz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4pcgz8/has_anyone_ever_had_success_with_using_suboxone/,5,https://redd.it/4pcgz8,Dupxran,"Has anyone ever had success with using suboxone, not to quit, but to cut their usage back, and have a safety net?","Not sure if people are going to say i'm an idiot, but here goes.  If you have a dope habit that's north of a bundle a day, its easy for that to become unmanageable, either because your tolerance continues to rise and the habit becomes more unaffordable than it already is, or because of the potential to be left so sick you cannot function in the event you cannot cop. 


When you have a habit as big as a bundle a day, the switch to suboxone is not always easy. Sometimes it takes up to 24 hours of being sick, and even then once you dose the suboxone, it doesn't always take your sickness away completely; often you will need a day or two of suboxone before you level out. 


Say an individual wanted to cut back, they could do the switch to suboxone one time, wait the 24 hours, be sick, take the induction dosage, and then stabilize. Then, move forward taking the suboxone at a dose of around 1 - 2 mg a day, dosing early in the morning, and then shooting through that dose in the afternoon when they wanted to get high. The idea behind this would be, what used to be a bundle or more a day habit, could then be reduced to a few bags a day. Of course you would have a slight reduction in how strongly you feel that shot, due to the blocking effect of the bupe, but this would be intended for someone who is trying to cut their habit back, but not quit. Then, they would wait 12 hours, and they could take their next dose of suboxone, without having to go through the drawn out induction process. Then, on any day a person decided they didn't want to use, or couldn't afford, they could simply ride out the suboxone, maybe taking a slightly larger dose than normal. On the days they want to use, they just shoot through it. THe idea is that as long as you keep some bupe in your receptors, you avoid the need to use as much dope, and as long as you time it properly, you can avoid the precipitated withdrawal, the same way someone who is on suboxone maintenance can slip up, get high and take their next dose right on schedule. 


Some may think this idea is stupid, and i guess if you want to quit, or you want to be a full on user, it is, but has anyone tried it? I would imagine there are some people out there who want to continue using, but need the safety net of the suboxone, and cant afford to support their habit using dope alone. ",1466622989.0

I tell her I'll call her everyday and don't worry I'll be fine. This is the first time I've ever left home on my own.

   A mixture of fear and excitement dance inside me. I'm riding with Mike and he's blaring rap music with his two twelves on full bass. I can't even hear the lyrics through the steady thrum but I couldn't care less if I could. I'm ready to get there and see where I'll be living and who I'll be living with. We started what should have been a four hour drive at noon and quickly ran out of things to talk about. I surfed reddit as long as I could to avoid boredom but it ended up taking us seven hours to get to our location.

  We get to this small town in Tennessee and I notice a tourist trap that had some great spots and make a note to check it out as it was only a small walk away. We get on the lot and I jump out and find the closes bathroom. A Porto-potty. 

   I reluctantly go inside no longer able to contain my piss from the seven hour drive. I finish my business but linger inside awhile to make sure I still have my H and one rig I brought with me. I think about doing a shot right then but decide against it since I n√©ed to get myself settled. I exit and find Lacey.

   ""Hey Lacey. I was wondering where I should put all my stuff."" I asked shyly. I'm usually pretty outgoing but I was outside of my comfort zone.

   ""Just give me a minute and I'll go get you a key and show you to your bunk room. I've gotta put some stuff on location(rides and games)""

   ""Okay, sounds great, thank you."" I reply.

   I find a secluded place to sit and smoke. I hope well just put stuff on location and then turn in for the night but that doesn't happen. Lacey and Clint set everything in it's spot. I watch them do this and I see Tish heading my way. Tish is a twenty six year old who looks like she spent her fair share of time smoking rock back a few years ago but doesn't anymore. She's kinda on the heavyset side but she's a sweetheart. And welcomes me kindly. 

  ""Hey man. You actually came. How do you like things so far?"" She says obviously excited to see a fresh face.

   I smiled back glad to have someone to talk to.

  ""Yeah, I didn't really have anything holding me down so I thought why not. I really don't know yet."" I said with a slight laugh. I haven't really seen what it's all about. But I'll let you know by the end of the week.""

She laughed at this too. ""You'll know by the end of tonight.""

And she was right. Instead of turning in we set up a couple of huge rides and during this I met Tony.  We instantly hit it off. He was 27 athletically fit and like to drink wine and do classy shit. He just like I wanted to do AT but felt he wasn't ready so opted to do this instead, he was from Philly and that was cool or so everyone thought. We ended work around two that morning and I was dead beat but decided to join Tish and Tony in Tishs room to watch Pineapple Express. They in the smaller than twin sized bed and me on a cooler it was still cramped but I enjoyed it. 

  They ended up passing out cuddling and I said my good night and turned into my closet sized room. I pulled out my dope and did a fourth of a point and nodded out for the next couple of hours til I passed out from exhaustion. The next day we set up the rest of the rides and I met the whole roaster if employees. 

   Two aryans one aconvicted murderer. Lacey's brother Rob who would end up my smoking buddy and other best friend but thought I was gay when I met him. Funny enough I joked with him about it and that made us fast friends. Me rob and tony ended up always saying this line from breaded chicken. ""I ain't gay... But I'll suck dat dick tho! And it will always be funny because of those guys. And a bunch of others who would shortly guit or get fired. This one black older fellow who gave me shit from the first day I was there. He also had a script of oxy. He said it was all in this one suit case and he left it outside under the trailer. So I crawled under on my fourth day and stole that shit. (I don't feel bad at all cuz he was so mean to me and he didn't really need them. Everyone was very welcoming and shared their food and drinks and weed with me til I got my first pay.

You want a reason why I keep doing dope?.. I have a million. I've been trying to quit for the umpteenth time. I was planning on doing three packs a day for awhile, work my way down to two and then down to one... You know the drill. My packs are about half a point btw. 

Lately I've been doing about 8 packs and hardly feeling it. That's about 4 points. I've known that I needed to quit for a long time. I just can't sustain this life style and it's tearing me apart. Today, I did my three packs this morning which *surprise* only left me three packs until Saturday left... less than the three a day that I had planned for. I go on my lunch break and guess how many I have now? If you guessed none, you're absolutely right. One of my good friends passed away Sunday and it's kind of been hitting me hard. I didn't want to feel it and although I knew that I wouldn't get high, I wasted my last three packs. I can still hear his voice, you know.. It's been two years since I've hung out with him because he got married and started a family, but I can still hear his voice like we hung out yesterday. He didn't die of opiates, he died of a heart attack. A heart attack at fucking 27. He was one of the most fit people I had ever meet... Never once overweight in his life and he died of a heart attack. Tell me how that is fair?

Anyway.. I did my last three packs and I'll spend my last 60 dollars on 20 more packs to split with my SO for *hopefully* five days of not feeling like I'm going to die. 

Sorry for the rant. Life just isn't fair some days. I sometimes wonder if this will be my last year on earth. People tend to become part of the 27 club when they're into drugs.

Purchase date- 6/23


source: Bobby Brown


Version: BTH


Color: Solid black, crunchy dope..slightly reflective/shiny on the inner layers. reminiscent of the good Onyx dope from the summer of 2013. smooth out both inner and outer layers, not brittle or sticky, non pliable

Stamp/Street Nickname:  No stamp (bth) served in plastic, codenamed Black Beauty by supplier

Mixture: 2 parts (1 gram total) heroin to 1 part lactose, pulverized into powder form in a pill bottle

Tasting notes: slightly bitter when the rock was licked raw, subtle hints of acetic acid on the forefront, with a smooth finish leaving notes of dark chocolate on the palette. slightly analgesic on the nasal mucous membranes. Gentle insufflation of smaller doses recommended.

High: slow onset followed by a very strong sedative high, this isn't the dope you nod off to, this is the dope you wake up from on the bathroom floor. Caution needs to be taken, as this dope is stronger than most BTH seen in 2016 by our street scouts  This dope would prove to be a challenge even for the most functional addict..as you go from slightly high to passed the fuck out in no time flat. 

Rating:  8.5/ 10 (DFL) = this dope is certified to have you doin the ""Dope Fiend Lean""and defying the laws of gravity while standing. Not for beginners, due to its ability to fuck off your whole day. this dope has legs because it will steal yours and control them...you only can move when the dope let's you...driving, talking, operating heavy machinery and walking should be done so with extreme caution. not recommended for those that drive motorcycles, ice skating on this dope is not recommended either, I would also avoid any lumberjack duties, as your chainsaw may feel slightly heavier than normal. Use caution if skydiving while high on this dope you may get a bit lightheaded. This may also cause you to fail a drug test as well

Usage : dude...don't get high alone with this shit, you might wake up dead  .. call up a friend and have someone to kick it with, naloxone on standby recommended.
go slow and take a test dose first  .this shit knocked my socks off and I woke up handcuffed to a dead and naked obese midget hooker (with one eye) in an SRO in the Tenderloin, had to chew my way out 

Warning: I've heard this stuff can be a little addictive for some people, and there is a rumor some people have died from doing heroin, just something to keep in mind. want to avoid addiction?...stay away from heroin kids

I pick it up from the pharmacy and take it my PCP tomorrow afternoon. I had the bright idea to do a few farewell lines this evening. Since I currently don't have a habit and don't fo into withdrawls when I take my breaks I shouldn't go into PWD's right?

EDIT: I asked that in a really confusing way lol. Basically what I'm saying is since I currently only use a couple times in a row, and never consecutive days , when I get the injection tomorrow afternoon I shouldn't have to worry about any pain when it boots whatever remaining H off of my receptors? It will be almost 20 hours from last use also. And H is a really short acting opioid. Fingers crossed! Bombs away!",1466738508.0

Not in the sexual way, but the sweaty, thirsty way. So I figured that heroin is responsible somehow for making me feel warm, like alcohol does.

However, few days ago I was feeling rather cold, so I put on a hoodie and asked father to close the window, `cause it's chilly. He looked at me like I was crazy and explained that it's 32 degrees Celsius outside and it's fucking summer.

I realized that I hadn't used in about 24 hours and was feeling quite shitty as well as cold, like I was coming down with something. So maybe I was feeling some of the withdrawal symptoms. I took a shot and sure enough, I got hot again, but I realized that it was actually appropriate to feel hot, because of the weather.

So, which way does heroin work. Does it make you feel super hot and sweat a lot after using, or does the lack of heroin after some time make you feel cold?

Or if this was really just something gone super weird, and hang on until I just ride it out. Basically I have done like 4 shots total Today. When I buy I just buy in dimes and twenties. I usually get like 4 dimes of boy and 2 dimes of girl. Or something very close to that. I only buy for one time use, or one big shot and one little shot. Otherwise I just end up using whatever I bought within the hour. Anyways just throwing in as much detail as possible in case anything is helpful. basically I was just on my way home, and had just picked up. I did my first shot. 4 boy, and two girl. There was some left over for a smaller second shot. I waited about 40 minutes and did the shot. The craziest/scariest thing proceeded to happen. Basically the best way to describe it is if you were tripping really hard on acid, and then you hit a whippit, and the proceeding whirlpool of confusion, and just complete distortion of reality begins to occur. It was insane. I started to have no idea who I was, where I was, what was happening, where I was going. I just got fucked up beyong belief, and I began to freak out that like something had burst in my brain and I was on my way to a slow and very confusing death. This was about 30 minutes ago. and nothing has happened yet. But has anyone ever experienced anything like this? I am super freaked out. I even began writing a goodbye letter to my family on the rest of the car ride home. I will edit with any other information. I am just posting my preliminary post as fast as possible. 

edit: everything appears to be okay at the moment. However, I am pretty freaked out about going to sleep tonight. For those of you that have never done a whippet while tripping on acid. It is one of the hardest things to even begin describing accurately. All I remember is Just being blasted into a place where nothing made sense at all. The people around me made no sense, where I was made no sense. Just simply having thoughts made no sense. It was just complete and utter confusion, that I am having a tremendously difficult time describing. So hopefully everyone has just eaten acid and done a whippet at the same time.

ALL TEENS CONSIDERING/CURRENTLY USING,"For the past 2 years since I was 16, I have dabbled with opiates. Ranging from Hydros, Oxy, Roxies, small time pills and managing to do it maybe twice a month when starting off. Recently my parents have split, there's been pressure since I've graduated because I don't feel like college is for me, my significant other is becoming distant. I feel like I'm being dragged down into a rabbit hole, drugs have always been my escape from this morbid reality. 

Last week, I went to pick up some bud from a guy I've known for a couple years and knew  I was into the opiates and tried to be the middleman. He said ""Hey man, I don't got any pops but I found an H plug recently and if you're into that then we can ride over and pick some up."" I don't know what happened to my thought process, but in nervousness and excitement, I was curious. We drove over to some sketchy dude's house, picked up a 30, and I was on my way. 

I got home and cut up a straw small enough to sniff this substance folded in paper, got a razor blade, and ran to my room to not even have the slightest clue that this high was inviting. It was promising, it touches your soul from that first sniff and ensures relief in your life that it's all okay. Next day, picked some up again, ran to my room. This is great, no problems, I'm not addicted that's just propaganda, I can stop. Next day, pick up, oh shit what am I doing? Why can my problems just disappear in the world of unfulfilled prophecies, my problems had a puzzle piece. I binged for a week with all my money from my one check and stopped because it sucked my soul. 

I felt so fucking depressed even just 24 hours without sniffing this contraption, hot/cold flashes, stomach turning, legs restless in bed. Not worth it at all, wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. My point is if you are considering that next step, find equilibrium and be prepared. If you are looking for a way out of your problems, oh this will do it for you, but it's a euphoric vacuum and I felt this way only after a damn week. I'm never touching an opiate again.

Heroin-related deaths there have increased five-fold since 2000.

‚ÄúThere is really a huge epidemic (of) heroin in the U.S.,‚Äù said Angela Me, the chief researcher for the report which was released on Thursday.

‚ÄúIt is the highest definitely in the last 20 years,‚Äù Me said, adding that the trend was continuing.

The rise could be linked to U.S. legislation introduced in recent years which makes it harder to abuse prescription opioids such as oxicodone, a powerful painkiller that can have similar effects to heroin, Me said.

The law meant the texture of the pills was changed to make it more difficult to crush them and inject them into the blood stream, Me said.

‚ÄúThis has caused a partial shift from the misuse of these prescription opioids to heroin.‚Äù

Another reason for the increase in the use of heroin, which in the United States mainly comes from Mexico and Colombia, is greater supply that has depressed prices in recent years, Me said.

However, what I've found is a place where people are taunted and poked fun at. Spoken down to and condensed.  Called names and frequently and quite literally told to go kill theirselves.

Like. We're inherently flawed drug users. If we can't be kind to each other, what hope do we ever have of encouraging the world to shift it's focus from treating our condition as a moral shortcoming to harm reduction?

Sad. Thought I could come here and discuss ideas and situations while others did the same free from harassment and childish name calling.

So a week ago I purchased a gram of very potent b-fent /manitol mix. (danger danger I know) but after caution testing it seemed mixed very well, I also mixed it before every shot /line. This gram lasted me all week non stop. 

The feeling is very similar to heroin, lasts almost as long too, however my tolerance went up by about double. 

I experienced WD for the first time in my life, writhing in sweaty agony, limbs on fire, heart racing, legs won't stop moving. 

To alleviate the pain I grabbed 3 bags of dope for me and my girl.

I shot 1 , and it took away the pain, and the second one barely got me high. I'm just happy to not be in pain. 

I'm waiting on another bag of this b-fent mix, and with it I am going to taper off, lower my dosage down to reasonable levels. 

I never want to go through withdrawals again, I am going to et back down to 1bag high levels (pre WD levels)

I have a fairly moderate tolerance, when I did snort morphine pills, I'd do 3 or 4 60s. When I take hydros, I take around 70 to 100 mg. Oxy, I like 80mg.

I've had some kratom today. Maybe 12 grams, the last of it at about 5pm (it's 8.30).

K, so on a whim a found the closest Gordon food services. Drove there and looked around for poppy seeds. I couldn't find anything so when I asked they let me know that they were behind the counter and the cashier could help me. This really suprised me.

I got 1.25 pounds for 12. Drove home. Poured seeds into a 2 liter. Poured in some lemon juice. Covered with hot water and shook like hell for 8mins. Filtered through old tee shirt.

Here's where I tifu.  I tied to pour the seeds all wet back into the 2 liter through a funnel. It wasn't happening, so I put them in a bowl and covered and stirred several times and filtered.

I drank that shit. It was vile and gross but I've had worse shit. I can't decide how high I am. Like I def feel it, but at the same time I feel a little paranoid and slightly disphoric . Kinda oddly energetic. Idk. Also, my stomache hurts from drinking that.

I've been lurking a while and posting here and there trying to help some people out. I've been sober over ten months until yesterday. Been doing kratom daily for a few weeks now. Moved to a new city for work with my girlfriend and it's been pretty great. Then the obsession set in again.. I stopped going to meetings and started looking around.. it's a college town so dope is hit or miss. I used to IV heroin years ago daily. I was homeless and I had nothing, jails and rehab often... then yesterday I found some. And I picked up 40 bucks worth and smoked it between yesterday and today...

I didn't get a rig because I know if I did that it'd be all over and id lose everything.. but I smoked it and it was blissful and I got that relief for a bit til the remorse and self loathing set in.. a bunch of bad shit happened just a few hours after my relapse because of it. My girlfriend is pretty sure about what happened but I've mostly convinced her otherwise.. so the hope is that I can just turn back to my kratom after this and not hurt too bad or hopefully curve the obsession for a bit.. I wanna pick up more buy then again I don't..

I threw all that sobriety down the drain and I feel so shitty about it and I'm gonna have to come clean sooner or later. It wasn't even worth it and I feel worse mentally than before I did it.. I have this job to hold down and I need to be doing my best but I've just lost so much motivation for life.. like things aren't that bad but they just feel that way..I hope I can just stick to my kratom from now on because I feel like I hate myself and I don't wanna go back to that life man it's too fucking miserable.. I can't lose everything I've worked so hard for again. I've lost everything so many times.. 

Sorry about the wall of text I'm just basically hating myself and need to air this shit out. I'm gonna have to come clean to my girlfriend because this isn't fair to her either.. I just am afraid. My whole life is run by fear (it autocorrected to gear at first, my phone has a sense of humor). But I could've done so many thing to keep this from happening and it's never worth it. I texted the dboy and he hasn't answered and I hope he doesn't but at the same time I want him to.. okay I'm done ranting..

Tldr; I released after ten months and I hate myself. Hopefully I can stick to my kratom from here out before I go down the path of destruction again. I always have another relapse in me but I've beaten the odds so many times I don't think I have another recovery. Have a swell day redditors.",1466805962.0
4pphs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4pphs9/falsely_accused_of_theft/,6,https://redd.it/4pphs9,Opiatethrowaway215,Falsely accused of theft :(,"Hey guys, I'm using a throwaway because I don't want this attached to my regular account. I really need advice from my fellow users. 

Ok, so I'm a heroin addict who lives with 2 other addicts, a guy and a girl. Lets call them Jim and Jenny just for hypothetical sake. They have been living together for 5ish years and I'm the only other roommate they've ever had. I met Jenny at work a couple years ago and we really hit it off on a personal level as well as a mutual love of opiates, we have been using together frequently for over a year, no issues/fights. I moved in with them this February and the plan was that I would pay them rent every week. I have never once paid even one day late since I moved in, until now. Jenny and I work together and we both only make tips so we can walk out with any amount of $ really. 

Onto the story: work has been really slow lately. I spend around $100/day on dope (I know, it's really ridiculous, I have a high tolerance.) Our dealer loves Jenny so she is able to get fronts from him. So 2 weeks ago she got me a front and I told her I was gonna be a couple days late on rent too because I literally had no $. 2 days later I gave her $100 and she asked if it was for rent or the front, I said ""do what works for you"" and she did not say anything to me about it til Friday when she told me she had paid the dealer. So all week i thought we were square. Sunday we were closed bc of Father's Day and that really fucked up my $ so I told her I would have to pay her late and offered to pay a late fee, at this point I had arranged to borrow rent $ from a friend. I had no dope and was surviving off methadone that I had squirreled away. 

Well this past week Jenny was house sitting and she wasnt home all week. I was so fucking dope sick I used my rent $ to cop, figuring I wouldn't see her til the weekend anyway and by that point I would definitely have all the cash. I know this was an asshole thing to do! I should have given her the $ or at least said something to her about it. I'm not proud that I did that. I didn't see or hear from her all week, until she got home yesterday, I could tell she was irked with me but I figured it was best to not poke the bear 

So yesterday she worked and I didn't, and a little while after she left I got a huge text message from her. In the message she said that I have to be out by Sunday, not only because of owing her $200 but she accused me of stealing 2 bags. This absolutely breaks my heart that she thinks this of me. She said that she went in her dope bag (zippered makeup type bag) and that 2 bags were missing from her 2 bundles and that the rubber bands had come off one of the bundles and the bags were all over. Now I might be a junkie but I'm surely not a fucking moron and if I were to take something wouldnt I replace things the way they were....? This was like a big neon sign that the contents of her bag had been disturbed. I know we are junkies and we do shady shit but I swear to fucking god I didn't touch her shit!! I have zero history of theft with anyone. I have to do 14 bags to get high so why in the fuck would I take 2??? That wouldn't even get me off sick, no joke. Also, she has cash in a drawer in the kitchen, and methadone, roxi 15s, and Klonopin in the cupboards, she has huge stockpiles of all these because she's prescribed them. If I wanted to get high on her dime I would have stolen cash or sold the pills for dope, instead of fucking up my living situation for $14 worth of dope that wouldn't touch my tolerance. Like I said I have no prior history of stealing from people not even like a piece of gum, and I've had fucking tons of opportunity! 

I think there are 4 possible scenarios here 
1) Jenny kept the bags for herself and told Jim I must have stolen them
2) Jim took them and blamed me (not likely tho)
3) The rubber band was fucked up and loose and they're dropped somewhere (this is my theory)
4) they made it up as an excuse to kick me out because of me being late with rent. 

I'm sorry this is so long. I just don't know what to do, there's no way to prove my innocence. Not only did I just lose my living situation but I lost 2 friends that I care about a lot. I'm really sad and I'm disappointed in myself for spending the $ on dope when she was gone this week. I actually have most of the money today but now I have to put $ towards a new place to live so I'm fucked. 

Oh I'm also probably going to lose my best friend of 7 yrs over this because she is super close to Jenny and she really disapproves of my use. She actually thinks Jenny is mostly clean and chipping, haaa.

Thank goodness I texted. Left that mixed in the sharp, grabbed another and only did one. I have a fairly high tolerance and I could definitely feel the one quite strong. Not a normal dope buzz, either. Not by a long shot. So, in other words, fent confirmed.

The guy says ugh, yea it looks like you got some two days ago and you take one a day so you should be good. I reply with, Look at my record man. It doesn't matter what I have I've been coming here for a year and a half and have always got my stuff filled when I had the money and transportation. (I get to use a car TWICE a week.)

Anyways I plan to call tomorrow and pray one of the other pharms is working that day as tomorrow will be the only day I'll have the car again until next weekend.

Probably dont have to be as worried over here as a more ""treatment"" oriented thread. But it is a sincere question.

I just started at a new methadone clinic. Basically, me dosing twice a day, on a lower dose, has personally worked better for me than taking a higher, once-a-day dose.
My old clinic was a private pay place, and wasn't very regulatory with their dosing. So, I paid a bit more for the diskettes, and wouldnt take my full 100mg in the morning. I would take 40-50mg, and save the rest for half way through the day, or evening, depending on if I was working that day.
I just switched to a place covered by insurance, but very strict with their dosing. Me, not being a pregnant woman, is not eligible for split-dosing, not accounting for the fact the short time window the clinic IS open and how far away it is from where I live.
So, only real option, other than taking my full dose in the morning, is somehow getting away from the window with some of my dose.
In previous clinics, if liquid, I could bring up my own drink to chase it with, and I could spit back roughly half my dose into my drink when ""chasing"" it, to put in the refrigerator for later.
Today, my second day at this new clinic I just transferred to, I was told I could not bring my bottle up to the window, unless it was a clear liquid. (the methadose is pinkish color.)
So, I took my full dose a second day in a row. If I must, I'll continue this way, as Ive had to in the past. Maybe I got a bit spoiled in my old clinic, but being able to dose twice a day (or, sometimes, even only once, with the rest saved in case of a missed day) was quite splendid. I know some may say it encourages addict behavior, but I have not relapsed at all doing it this way, havent sold my dose, and if anything, has kept me taking less overall and less at a risk for relapse. If a friend wanted to use, I could stay at home and just take my remaining 40mg and be more content than if not.
Ive been in similar situations in the past, but not this strict with the liquid dosing. What do you guys think about this? And others that have done this sort of thing before, if youre comfortable speaking about it, what was your ways around it?
Thanks and I hope not to offend anyone. My number 1 goal for being back on methadone is to get, and remain clean! So this is just a speedbump, if at all, but I am a bit uncomfortable now, being used to the lax-ness of my previous clinic. At this point, if I could afford it, I thnk it may have been worth the $65 weekly charge. Alas, I cannot afford it though, so Im going about an hour away (via car, luckily insurance now covers cabs, Ive been bussing it until yesterday, which took hours in the hot 115-120 degree phx, AZ sun) which this place is covered via my insurance. So thankful I dont have to pay, as I am completely out of money. So I cant complain, would just prefer to take less of my dose in the morning if I still can, without dropping my dose with the doc.

‚ÄúAny such drug should be considered deadly,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere is also no reason to suspect there are any boundaries to how far the tainted drugs have been sold or distributed. Neighboring communities are warned as well.‚Äù

i'm a late 30's loser living with my parents. i have a job (till now) and try to be as functional as i can. i had tried to taper down this week and thought it would be bareable, but it wasn't. constant hot/cold flushes, stomach cramps, cannot sleep, diahhrea every couple of minutes, vomiting... you know the drill.

my mum had been suspecting for a while but i always denied. today she insisted on getting a doctor, i kept saying no, until finally i said a doc would be useless and a waste of money. i actually asked my parents for money to get a gram and they obliged, gods be praised.

i always tried to hide things because:  

* a: i didn't want to worry them

* b: it's unfair to offload my problems on them

**should i tell them that heroin is what i'm using?** my parents are baby-boomers (we're somewhere in the e.u.) and know next to nothing regarding drugs. i really feel bad worrying them but since they already suspected something was off, maybe this is for the better.

i plan to go to a doc i know and try getting on suboxone (again).

I got a new brilliant connect a couple of months back. I was in heaven.. not only was it the best gear in years, but he sold 'T10bags' Meaning, it was way easier to beg or scrape together just - 10 enough to stay fairly well and mellow throughout the whole day, also the pickup spot was opposite a 24/7 pharmacy with free access to every bit of kit needed. AND a 2 minute walk.from all of that was a big shopping center with large  individual bathroom stalls! Everything a growing boy needs to feed and water himself. 

Anyway.. I'm now in a total panic as zi just completed my daily routine,.but I totally and stupidly left my phone on one of the fold out baby change tables (yes, the stall was a huge individual disabled and was plenty big inside, far nicer for pinning than trying to lean down and stab yourself in a tiny 2ft square toilet!) So.. I went back for it and found a manager rooting through the garbage bin which I had filled with bloody tissues, used pins (which I always cap when throwing away as a courtesy to bin men so they don't accidentally prick themselves).

There is a CCTV notice outside and I go in there daily for weeks around the same time. 

I don't know what they 'have' on me. But its obvious I can't go back there because I have repeatedly filled their trash with used and bloody paraphernalia and locked myself in the big bathroom for 15 minutes at a time every day for weeks. If they had noticed the junk I leave (I have always 100% cleaned up after myself, never leaving blood or anything on the floors or whatever.)

Has anybody had any experience being.caught by stores in this way and what can happen now?

If they have found the mess daily, then I would have thought I'd be walking into a trap one day. However, today,.I did my business and it was onky after I returned.to get my.phone I had forgotten I now know that they know. So, that IS a positive. But, I'm seriously freaking out worried that they speak to other managers of other branches in town - as I have *liberated* vast amounts of Loperamide and the occasional sandwich from the clutches of their health aisle and refrigerated lunch area. If they get organised and talk to one another (let alone other stores selling milkshakes and sandwiches) I am fucked. I don't know how often these places keep tapes of the CCTV covering the exit of a bathroom stall...

Shit. Is all I can think. Getting my face up in stores is less than ideal. To be fair they do have to prove that what goes on inside the room and goes into the trash is related to the guy that goes in every day. I'm sure you guys and gals know what constitutes a decent public toilet! And damn, it was a seriously nice public shit box.. a real rarity in this game!

I started with the warm(ish) water and mixed in just over a point of tar.  After all of that dissolved into the water, i then sniffed a couple of bumps just to set the mood while i prep for my space flight. 

Finally, the moment has arrived. As I take my time registering, i cant help but notice how the solution in the barrel of the rig isnt a single uniform color. At the bottom its a sickeningly sweet shade of brown and it fades to clear the closer to  the plunger you get. 

BINGO

How on Earth does the government explain why Fentanyl can be prescribed and not heroin when they perform similar functions AND fenatyl is stronger?

I just can't think of how they get away with excusing this. 

I hated watching the smug people that work at Fenatyl act like they were so noble for saving people from pain when they are nothing more than legal drug dealers. Not that dealing drugs is bad but it's just that these people so obviously see themselves as saviours when they aren't, they're dealers.

The doc showed how the company that produce this fentanyl spray incentivise doctors to prescribe it and how they get around regulations in order to get insurance to pay for it for non-cancer patients even though it's only approved for cancer.

In a way these companies are worse than drug dealers because drug dealers don't tend to tell you you need something when you don't, they don't tend to push drugs on people, at least not to the same agressive extent as these doctors, who tell people they need these drugs (as far as I understand anyway).

They also showed how the makers of oxycontin got it to be used so much, they would run commercials claiming it was not strong or addictive.

These people are allowed to operate in broad daylight! I hate how unfair the world is.

But yeah does anyone know how the government actually explains why a drug like fenatyl can be legalised and not heroin? Why can't heroin be legalised and prescribed for pain? In fact wouldn't it be better to prescribe heroin before fenatyl if fenatyl is the strongest? Not to mention all the other benefits of drug legalisation which come up time and time again: taxable, safe pure products, less money to crime, help for addicts instead of criminalisation of them.

and if you've passed out will this be because of respiratory depression or innocent nodding/drowsiness? As in, could you go into respiratory depression related unconsciousness and then wake up on your own once the drug had worn off? Or is the case that as soon as you go unconscious due to respiratory depression/shallow breathing, you won't wake up without medical intervention?

If you could go unconscious due to shallow breathing and then wake up without medical intervention I'm guessing you would wake up with brain damage because of a lack of oxygen to the brain?

Trying to understand the difference between safely passing out on opiates and dangerously passing out I suppose. I'm a bit baffled about whether one can wake up on their own after going through respiratory depression. If one could in theory wake up after a day or two on their own after not breathing properly with brain damage. Sounds horrific. But all the cases of brain damage I've heard of so far seem to be from stories where people have had medical intervention to wake them up. I just wonder, if those people would have likely woke up on their own without help but with more brain damage.

Basically - Is it possible for the breathing to lessen or stop for short bursts such that you don't die but you wake up with brain damage once the drug has gone down in your system? (Without intervention)

Been off/on bupe for like 4 months, buddy had some poppy seed tea, took 4mg bupe, about 4-6 hours later finished my glass of PST. Roughly at midnight last night. Didn't feel much. When do you guys think I can take more bupe?

I've heard 36 hours, which seems kinda overboard. I've taken bupe 7 hours after a massive fent binge (~100mg over 3 days) and been totally kosher, 13-14 hours after two days of moderate-dose morphine (300mg) and codeine (300mg) mixing both and been absolutely fine. What do you guys think would be the minimum length of time to wait? Not in W/Ds, have been on sub long enough that sub W/Ds would be the only W/Ds I'd feel. You think the bupe just made the PST plink of my receptors and I'd be good in 18-24 hours post-dose?

I've gained 30 lbs since resuming my pill habit in 2014.  Weight gain has happened in the past on opiates so I know that's the cause.  Off opiates I'm stick-thin.  I do cardio 5 days a week and strength training 1 day.  I try not to exceed 1,500 calories, though sometimes I fail due to increased sugar intake (opies make me crave sweets).  

No matter how hard I try, I cannot lose even one pound and somehow keep *gaining.*  Before opiates I ate what I wanted, never exercised and weighed 117 lbs; now I'm at a whopping 147 despite my active lifestyle and calorie counting.  I've had blood work and my thyroid levels are fine, so that's not it.  

Anyone else have this problem?  Most junkies I see are emaciated and thin, so I'm really confused.  I know constipation and water retention could be contributing, but surely I'm not THAT constipated (right?).  Do opiates slow your metabolism to a screeching halt or something?  

((Quitting pills is not an option.  I just want to know the science behind the weight gain so I can find a solution.  Any medical studies you could point me to would be greatly appreciated)).",1466896261.0

Other ROA's,"So I have been addicted to opiates for 11 years now.  It was insuffalated oxycontin for the first two years,  then IV Dilaudid and Oxycontin for the next 9 years.  I did a year in prison got out and there were no longer any pills to be found for cheap.  You'd be lucky to find 30's, it is now just black tar heroin everywhere. 

Four months ago I tried heroin for the first time. I love it.  Now,  when I first IV'ed Dilaudid,  I went absolutely crazy,  sold everything I had within a month, totalled my car,   went to my first detox. Total fiend bullshit.  Now I don't know if it's because I have gotten older or what,  but with heroin,  although I fucking love it, I haven't gone crazy like I did with pills all those years ago. 

I have managed to use in a controlled legit way.  I try to be as honest as I can be (I am hiding my use from my family and SO, so obviously there is some dishonesty with that), I work for the money that I use to get high,  I don't steal.

I know I an treading a very fine line and that I could easily lose control and be fucked again.  But heroin feels very different than pills to me. I don't understand the stigma that surrounds heroin.  I always see these posts ""I only do pills, never done heroin,  never shot up"". 

Heroin is just as addictive as Oxycodone and other strong pain meds. Shit morphine and heroin are the same except that acetyl ring. 

I guess what I am trying to get at here is TL;DR Why is there a stigma with heroin Vs. Pills and IV  Vs other ROA ?",1467016710.0

Good looking community with very sophisticated people here. I am in the same position as many hoping to go from habitual use to occassional after a spell of sobriety. I've been clean about a year from what peaked at about 150mg oxycodone a day (would say majority of habit was about 90mg a day of oxy), except for the occassional kratom or 20mg hydro. Maybe like 10-15 total individual ""dosings"" in this year's time, all of which lead to no significant withdrawals. Keeping very fit and healthy and this seems to bring confidence that I can chip. You could say life is ""brilliant"". My soul/brain/cock thinks I can chip because I recently required more oxy and morphine at no cost to me, and its been waiting for me to have a taste. Oxy by far my DOC, I've been having the odd kratom or hyrdro use as stated above and therefore during these uses never felt any withdrawal or real regret (I've never touched H, IV or any street drugs, only pharms that I can measure the dose and such). Its definitely a mental battle, like I'm being promised by my heart that this high will be well worth the wait, but being promised by my brain that the immediate aftermath will either be 1) underwhelming/disappointing (which might inspire to take more) or 2) overwhelming/good or dangerous/bad (which will inspire a redose back to glory or regret/guilt). I have tried chipping before with like a few weeks or even up to 6 weeks in the sobriety saddle, but never like a real year behind me. Wish I chronicled this in the past, but I think that most of the time I didn't really ""feel"" drugs unless I was in active addiction. Right now, my only real physical addiction is intense cardio everyday/workout/do yoga, not drugs, but obviously I humbly come to you, /r/opiates because I acquired this stuff and feel divided about being able to let some air out of the tires without much in the way of negative consequence. Famous last words huh?

Most of the time, my ""chips"" following long periods of sobriety to drugs stronger than kratom kind of seemed underwhelming and VERY constipating (remember that tolerance to constipation develops slower than euphoria). I hate being constipated. Kratom is less constipating, and would somehow always leave me with a feeling of satisfaction at the experience, and a lack of nutcase craving. Meaning I can do a dose and then I'm good for weeks with, at worst, very very slight irritability the next day. I guess the take home message is that you really have to have something to live for above and BEYOND getting high to overcome any arising obsession that could come from points 1 and 2 above; for me, its the need to get to the gym following a dose of anything to ""get it out of my system"". What say you guys? During periods of sobriety, when applicable, did you make these whole life changes (eat something resembling a paleo diet in addition to the exercise as major changes) I did and then try chipping with that as your foundation, or was your sobriety all about watching the clock tick and thinking that passage of time was all it took?",1467009766.0

Entry #1.,"TL;DR: Former daily user plans on chronicling his attempt at chipping after period of sobriety. Hopes better surroundings can protect from pitfalls.

I just recently celebrated my fifth month of sobriety, and I'm going to use tomorrow. I often see questions posted about whether or not chipping is possible after having a serious addiction. That is, of course, the dream of many addicts; to be able to enjoy the occasional nod on the weekend without watching life spiral out of control. I'd like to try, and I hope to catalogue my experience here.

Just some background:

At one point, I maintained about a gram a day habit (two buns of philly's finest). I had little to no control of my use. My longest period of sobriety in adulthood has been about two months, prior to now. I managed to abuse almost every drug that I ingested, from crack and heroin, to air duster and robotussin, to benadryl and red bull.

I have no plan in place to attempt to regulate my use, other than to only use when it feels safe, and is convenient. I'm realistic about the fact that that might change. If my use begins to spiral out of control, I plan on coming clean to my family/support group, and starting over, with the knowledge that I truly am powerless.

I hope this time will be different. I'm familiar with the ""rat park"" experiment, and since I've gotten clean I've put together a decent life. I'm happy most of the time. I've learned a lot about myself, and through counseling, have come to terms with a lot of the things in my past that I believe contributed to the obsession to use. Since I now live in my own personal ""rat park,"" I plan on using opiates as a supplement to an already satisfying life, rather than having drugs be my only means of finding peace.

I plan on updating when I feel the need to, I'd like if my personal journey could in some small way contribute to this sub.

I would also love feedback, and if I hear a generally negative or dismissive tone, then I'll assume this isn't the content the subreddit wants to see, and stop posting. Otherwise, rock on.

Until opiates. 

I had used oxy, percs, and even tried heroin a couple of times over the course of many years. I never really enjoyed it that much, for me it was a drug I would only do if it was in front of me, and something I could only do at night while I was able to relax and enjoy it. I could never understand how people could do them and function at work or for any other purpose than just sitting around. 

At the beginning of the year I ended up in a situation where I was around them a lot, and before I knew it I was physically dependent. After many attempts I broke the physical addiction, and I'm still not physically addicted again, but i have such a hard time staying away for more than a few days. I don't even get that high, I've never done more than one blue at a time, usually only a half... But something about that little boost it gives me, I just can't stay away. It's such a shitty cycle.

Long time no visit for me. Been on the Bupes for the past year. I had gotten off them before, slipped after a year and a half, got off them again, then got sucked back in. It has been about a year and a half now buping it and I am tired of being half a man.

Just putting out my attack plan if that's okay, and if anyone cares to share their experiences or knowledge I'd appreciate it. So, getting off it - 2-3 weeks, right? So I figure switch to hydrocodone for that amount of time. My last Bupe was on the 15th, so 11 days now. The idea is to be on hydros until the bupe is out of my system (which I really wish I could get a better idea of than 2-3 weeks) - and then do a 4 or 5 day methadone taper.

The biggest issue is that I want to avoid being a soppy, gloppy, frail sack of shit at work - so I was hoping to take advantage of 4th of July, which gives me Monday off. But it's cutting it close, I should have started earlier.

So, the way I see it, here are my choices:

1) Start my 5 day methadone wean on Tuesday, in two days. This means I have two days of being completely raw at home before getting to work, but it means I start before the point where I am certain all bupe is out my system - 3 weeks.

2) Keep taking hydros through the fourth of July, and start my Methadone wean on the 4th, making my last dose of methadone on Friday, giving me the weekend to get situated. 

3) Something else or something in between?

Any suggestions would be helpful. I've done it like this before, the switch to pills and them methadone taper - but the circumstances were different. I'm tired of being a zombie, but I also want to make sure I give myself the best chance.

Thanks.

Don't worry I have stopped trying to get this euphoria off opiates now as even at higher doses I don't feel it and then I just end up sick. 

But I was wondering whether alarmingly it could indicate that my ability to feel happiness has permanently been destroyed.

I have not felt happy for about 3 years now due to severe depression and I was wondering whether it's possible that my brain has forgotton/lost the ability to be happy now.

Maybe this is another reason I don't notice dope sickness if I don't take opiates - people describe dope sickness as watery eyes, runny nose, mucous throat, depression - well I already always have watery eyes, runny nose and mucous throat all the time after health problems which began years ago, (I only stared to use oxy a few weeks ago) and I always feel depressed anyway - so I don't ever notice these as new when I don't take oxy. The only thing I might feel is nausea and I might vomit, but that puts me off wanting to take oxy again rather than make me crave more.

Anyway, I'm kinda worried that my brain has permanently lost the ability to ever be happy again - even chemicals can't remind me of happiness, will I ever experience natural happiness again? It's also kinda depressing to realise that my health is so bad that this is why I don't even notice dope sickness, because I tend to always have the typical symptoms of dope sickness due to health problems and depression.",1466970873.0

I recently acquired 55mgs of methadone. Now, I'm a heavy kratom user. I used to get blasted off of a 40mg oxy, but the kratom either blocks oxy, or has risen my tolerance. I recently took 100 mgs oxy, and felt nothing. 

Anyway, despite what some ppl say, kicking a 30 gram a day of potent leaf for a year straight is right up there with the 240 mg oxy I kicked, no joke. The RLS and body temperature shifting is insane. 

I was thinking of waiting till day 2 of kratom withdrawals, and then take a single, low dose of methadone. With the long half life, by the time the methadone leaves my system, most of kratoms alkaloids will be gone, and I should be feeling fine, right? I was thinking of starting with 10mgs.

18 years old. I find myself out of high school and ready to take on life. I get a job at a local dollar store, and attend my local community college with the intention of making something of myself. That semester I passed all my classes with flying colors, and established my self as a hard working, money saving motherfucker. I even had the time to start another death metal band and actually play shows and make music with some great people, who became great friends. We had band practice and hung out and smoked weed almost every day of the week. What more could I want? Well I found that out pretty soon. I don't know even understand how it all panned out, but my dealer didn't have any weed and I just got paid, so there was a problem. So I find myself branching out to one if my brothers friends who mainly sold 30's but usually had loud to go with it, would you know on this fateful day he wasn't good either? Pills were never my cup of tea but I figured I might as well ask, I can't be sober today. Of course his script was out but could find some for 30 a piece. Fuck that, so I ask him what else he can get (I had coke in mind) and he told me he can get his hands on heroin.... Well fuck it, I might as well try it, and see what all the fuss is about, so I give him 40 bucks and he gives me this bag of white shit that smells like vinegar, and of course I thought I basically just got robbed and sold some random ass vinegar chalk, I mean the shits not even brown, so I figured I learned my lesson with trying to branch out on drugs and I'll chalk this up as a loss. Fast forward to an hour later when I snort this random bag of vinegar chalk because if I'm gonna pay 40 bucks for this chalk, I'm still gonna snort it, and I'm gonna snort all of it. Well that was a night full of puking and it led me to feel like complete shit and have to call out of work the next day, and as I recall I hated this vinegar chalk drug to the fullest extent possible. But like most things I hate, I still dealt with it at least twice a month for the next couple of months. My semester ended and I passed all my classes, and quit my job because fuck a dollar tree. Summer was shitty but it went faster than a bullet, and next thing I know I'm starting my second semester of college. I met a girl though and she actually liked me according to some mutual friends, and for a guy who's always had some of the lowest self confidence in the tri county area, nothing felt better than that. Plus I really really liked this girl. We hit it off immediately and start hanging out at least 2 or 3 days a week. Well at this point in time I was still doing dope a couple times a month and our mutual friends were two girls who would cop with me and we'd all get high and play uno, so sooner than later my new friend starts talking to me about how our friends wanted her to dope with them, but she was nervous and told them she only wanted to try it with me for the first time. I was so excited to do my favorite thing with my new favorite person, and she had the money and the car so we make one of the biggest mistakes of our lives and get high together.... Within a week we were dating, and hanging out more than ever and over the next 2-3 month's we go from doing shit every week, to every other day, turns out her grandma is pretty well off and keeps my girlfriends pockets full. Also my grades dropped so low I have absolutely no idea how I didn't fail,but at the end of the day I passes all of my courses that semester and ended up falling in love with a girl and getting so much self confidence I felt like I could take on the world as long as I had my love, and my girlfriend.

What I mean is, I guess we get to decide for ourselves--not so much what is true or real, not really--but what we think.

My friend's little sister has been using opiates for quite a few years now, through having two kids and more than enough sad/scary/shitty situations for the three of them to all be a little scarred. This is especially unfair to her daughters who have been through everything you want so desperately to shield/protect innocent children from. 

Her older brother, my friend, has been shooting heroin since 1998. He quit for four years but then he relapsed again about a year ago. Right now his health is hella bad but he just keeps pumping the black tar into his system. Sepsis and abscess, vomit and bile, blown out veins and pockmarked cheeks, clogged up ass can't shit for weeks--I wish I could help him but frankly I have my own demons trying to shove their gnarly staph-soaked fingers into my lazy stinking asshole. 

Anyway my friend and me and his sister were talking the other day while we made up our stupid scum-filled shots and trying to find somewhere to hit ourselves, little streams of infected blood were flying about around us as we stabbed ourselves psycho style until each of us managed to luck into something somehow. I'm sure then as is usual my dumbass missed a little bit of the shot somewhere and gave myself another black tar tattoo framed lovingly by a bunch of bloody bruises that remind me of other idiots I used to fix with. 

We should have stuck with frying our brains on acid and shrooms but from the first time we'd felt a tattoo gun pushing into our flesh we had craved the needle and I will tell you that me personally, I always knew I would do heroin. My friend and his sister both agree they feel the same.

Way back before we met this homey was a dumbfuck little kid from a farm in the middle of nowhere who had heard of heroin in books because all he did was read and also there was that one year of D.A.R.E program at school but anyway he wasn't dumb and he can generally read between the lines but nevertheless his rural and isolated circumstances led to the fact the he simply had no clue of anywhere in the world he could have found someone willing to sell him *any* sort of drug. No Marijuana, LSD, PCP, Cocaine, Meth, Heroin or anything else. They were all the exact same to him....absolutely unobtainable. Until all of the sudden they weren't. He finally got the brilliant fucking idea to quit his exploitive telemarketing job and to take off down the road using his booger-covered thumb and occasionally hopping a slow moving train with friends/other bums he met on the way. Somewhere along the line he and I ran into each other, ended up sharing all our best shit and girls with each other, and even better we had so many laughs that sometimes we would even manage to forget for brief snatches of time all of the infernal bumps and scrapes that plague people like us who don't really give a fuck--or else wishing to feel nothing for so long and hard that the bottle gets emptied and we can solidify all of our best memories. Black out the rest...

...What was I talking about? Oh yeah, back then I could seriously connect with good people given the right time and circumstances for us to get to know each other and it was obvious that I could get along with this kid, so we quickly became fast friends/road dogs. 

Back to the whole point I started out here to make and digressed from way back there about perspectives so like I was saying, me and my friend and his sister were sitting around trying to handle our needs and to feel free to forget for a second or so about all the times we felt we'd fucked up just to get high. My friend said he was ashamed. He said this was the lowest he'd felt in all his years. He was physically sick all the time and even said he feared  a bit for his life. He said he was embarrassed about his chosen lifestyle and he felt too low to even look his own loving mother in the eyes, the one person he knew loved him unconditionally. He couldn't face her. He felt he should have known better.

His sister listened to all that and I guess to try and make him feel better she started listing off some of the things she had done because of her addiction/selfishness (her own word for it). She stole $10,000 the life-savings of her poor grandmother from underneath the old lady's bedroom rug. She stole her widowed mom's wedding ring. She stole all of her dead uncle's gold rings and had them melted down. And on and on she listed some pretty sketchy stuff. But it got worse. She had two kids and while she was pregnant with both of them she shot heroin the entire time. They were both born into withdrawals. The older daughter stayed in the bathroom of dingy hotel rooms while her mom turned tricks on the bed not to feed her kid no but to get herself another fix. They starved and clung to each other freezing in the middle of winter with nowhere to sleep but a small import hatchback already on its last legs more than 50,000 miles ago keeping fingers crossed no flashlight would come knocking on the window asking for I.D. and sniffing around greedily with fat mustached snout for something to eat/hurt/fuck/or at the very least for someone they might instill a little fear into, power-tripping the way these sorts love more than anything to do. 

Well the sister of my friend and her first daughter made it through that night and lots of others like it but that doesn't mean living this way didn't take it's toll. Her second daughter was born a few years after that but the baby didn't even make it through one day before she succumbed to all this shit. 

After I heard that I told her my honest opinion. I said it sounded like she was pretty fucked up. But she said she felt fine with herself, she felt like she had earned forgiveness or redemption somehow I could sense but we all knew she was still haunted by her daughter's death because here she was trying to stab herself over and over with the poison of futile forgetfulness, just like the rest of us. 

Yeah perspective. She said she is fine with herself now. Her other daughter is doing well in school. Despite all she did even to her close family members she never did burn no bridges. And she isn't the slightest bit ashamed. Defiant bitch. I admire her for that. I do.

Because I know that like my good friend I feel pretty fucked up about myself too. But I don't steal and I try not to lie and I have never hurt anybody, not on purpose anyway.  

Still me and my friend can't shake the feeling that we're failures and that we're fuck ups. I'm not saying we are wrong or she is right or vice versa or any of that. Remember the point I hoped to make? Perspective.  That's how we see things. 

What the hell else can I say?  Anyone out there got any drug-fueled responses I can suck down like cheap dope cut with sickness to fuck with this old head of mine? Please snap me out of this. Or whatever. What the fuck ever.  ",1467093833.0

This never happend to me until a few months ago (even when in full withdrawl) and I've been using for like 3 years now. 

The only difference I can think of is that around the time I started having the headaches my hookup started getting the 30s imprinted with K9, whereas before that they were always imprinted with A215. I don't at all see how that could make a difference but hey, who knows.

Story of my wakeup call inside,"So, the company that I work for has a meeting for all the general managers every other Monday. Figured today was just a regular old meeting, go over ou numbers, blah de blah. Anyways, I get there and no one else is there besides the owner of the company and my district manager. I run one of the busier stores so figured it was just gonna be a bash opithrowateaway meeting. 

As of late we've been having cash shortage issues, nttuint extreme, just $20 herex $40 there, but only the managers can cancel and edit orders so obviously I'm a suspect, but beleiev or not its not me. I don't see any reason to risk ny job over practically pennies.


So anyways ny bosses bring me into the meeting room and ask what's going on because lately I've been on edge and exhaustedx causing me to be overwhelmed and drift off during meetings. I work over 65 hours a week, I feel like anyone would be exhausted. Also, I was just promoted to GM about two months ago so it is still new and a lot of hard work. 

Both bosses know I've had a drug problem in Yeats past and ask if I've been using again. The owner says they're trying to help me and being honest is the only way they can help. I can not afford time off or any of my family knowing so obviously I lie about it. Then he asks me if I would pass a drug test. my heart starts pounding but I still say yes. I literally did a line before I walked into the meeting. I figured they'd have me do one on my next shift wednesday or whatever but then he says, okay I have one now I want you to go take it. I think to myself, well, looks like its time to find a new job. Didn't know whether I should just walk out and quit or fail the test and see what happens. Either way I was fucked. It was a 12 panel urine test from the drugstore but it did not look like one of the cheapo ones. So I chug the rest of ny coffee and head into the bathroom to face my fate.

No one went in or watched me, so I put a little bit of pee in there and filled the rest with toilet water, making sure to keep the yellow color. He sets it up to work and we go back into the other room for the longest 5 minutes of my life and discuss other work things.


He goes and grabs the test and pulls out the pamphlet to decipher it. I told him I was gonna fail for weed and possibly vicodin from a toothache prescription. He deciphers it all and is reading all the drugs off. Meth, negative. PCP, negative. THC, positive. Amphetamines, negative. Heroin, FUCKING NEGATIVE. he says that with a sigh of relief. Now for the kicker. Cocaine, positive. I totally fucking forgot I did coke on Friday. This is another story, but he thinks I have a prescription for adderall, but amp comes up negative. Junkie brain thinks quick and I say, well maybe my medicine comes up as coke because its kinda the same. He shrugs it off and says its all good bc he was mainly worried about dope.

Oh my fucking God I just got the luckiest I have ever gotten in my life. Idk if it didn't show because I diluted it, or if my dope is actually fent but I don't even care. I was completely speechless. 

Moral of the story, I think.its time to clean up. This shit isn't worth my job, especially when sniffing it isn't even getting me high anymore and I know if I shoot up once I am essentially giving myself a death sentence. Thanks for reading, anyone else have any stories like this or know why it didn't show up?",1467066209.0

I could tell something was up immediately after he did the shot. He was standing up but swaying in our bathroom, chin down and eyes half-closed. I got closer and saw that his eyes were bouncing around in his head and the color was quickly draining from his face. I went for the Narcan to get it ready. He saw me prepping it and literally ran away...but moments later he was completely unconscious and unresponsive on our bed, sweating profusely, skin turning from white to grey. I pulled down his jeans and stuck him in the thigh with the IM syringe. A few moments later he was in serious pain. He was still pale and sweating but now crying from the pain of precipitated w/d. I felt terrible for having to subject him to that kind of pain, but I was also furious because he insisted on doing the shot right before we were supposed to walk out the door to get to my morning Subutex dose and IOP group meeting. Ended up missing the meeting and getting a surprise UA when I finally did make it into the clinic. Sigh. Anyhow, just wanted to tell SOMEONE about the heart attack of the day.

So here I am, I'm really na√Øve when it comes to opiates since I never tried some (except for Keaton once a few years ago).

I wanted to play it safe so I bought a milligram scale for 30‚Ç¨ 
I really didn't know how to get some smack so, after reading tons of posts I read an user referring to H as ""brown sugar"" I suddenly realized that brown sugar is sold OTC in any grocery store here around (EU, for the ones asking).

Fast forward 5 minutes I'm in the closest one and bought some 500g for something around 2‚Ç¨ (still unbelievable for me how you guys keep paying $$$ for something that cheap) anyways...

I'm at home, I managed to buy a needle, gently dissolved 0,1 in to 50ml of water, cooked it like a pro and literally watched every IV tutorial on YouTube but still, can't register, I don't really know what I'm doing wrong it just makes so much pain when the needle enters the skin, I tried so many veins, both arms, legs, hands... nothing, no blood at all except in the floor, on my arms, on every clothes but not in the syringe. 

My body now looks like it was perforated by bullets, my BFF start calling me Swiss Cheese and I can't really stand it.

I don't even say that in a depressing way, I fucking love opiates and the only thing that stops me from daily usage at this point is the desire to not experience withdrawal and the fact that it's way too expensive for us to maintain anymore.

I checked with my insurance and he was listed in my network. He did a drug test on my first visit , and I recently checked my insurance claims and saw that he sent my drug urine test to company that my insurance denied any coverage because they are out of network. I have an epidural procedure tomorrow but am having second thoughts since I have a 500 dollar deductible which I will have to pay and the drug test lab work cost 1500 dollars to do!  Also I am due to see him the day after my epidural for a refil on my meds. However if he wants to drug test me again I will refuse , and I know that means I won't get my pain medication and dropped by him as my pain management dr however it's a lot more painful knowing I have to pay 1500 dollars per drug test.. 

For good measure I called my insurance company today and told them my situation and they said the lab is out of their network so no coverage will be provided. What are my options here? Do I bite the bullete and pay the 1500 and find another pain management dr that doesn't pull this shady sort of stuff or can I take legal action? Basically I paid with copay and cost of medicine 1700 dollars for 150 Percocets. I am very upset about this and also thinking of not paying the lab and let them send me to collections since this ahole of dr didn't even bother to check and see if the lab was in my insurance network

Would you guys go through with the epidural tomorrow if you were in my position or would you postpone it and wait to see him the following day for the refil and see if he drug tests me then and talk to them to get the 1500 dollar bill sorted out first before deciding on getting an epidural shot from him ",1467191665.0

Obviously by my name I've done the withdrawal thing NUMEROUS times but this is the first time I actually feel pretty decent except for a little bit of malaise feeling. I know the suboxone life is something like 48 hours so shouldn't I have been relatively sick by now? It's been 4 days since I last took the strip as of now.

I'm hoping that this is the result of me barely staying well for a few weeks prior to taking the strips and this is the extent of my withdrawls this time as I'm committed to being done for once. 

As a side note I have noticed that since I was put on Cymbalta, it has made my withdrawl symptoms from opiates much less worse. I've also been on metaproplol as well for blood pressure not related to withdrawls. ",1467180531.0

Ive been constantly arguing with and bitching at my bro...




Whether its dope or pills, my bro insists its worthwhile to do one or two rinses, or washes, on the shit left behind on the spoon after filtering through a cotton.



I try to tell him he probably gets 95 percent of the drug on the first draw (number pulled from my ass, but I'm sure it's close). I tell him that he is just increasing the amount of dangerous binders and fillers he's putting into his bloodstream. Which we all know can harm the lining of vessels, and worse.




I also try to explain that you are using up your veins three times as quickly, where he takes 2 to 3 shots to my one.



I understand people wash their cottons when they have nothing, but that is with a bunch of cottons saved, each with a tiny amount of drug, which I guess might make a dose... but that at least makes a little sense.



So, assuming I'm correct, both me and my bro highly respect r/opiates' collective knowledge, and some input from you guys would help him understand, since he doesn't freakin' want to listen to his big bother lol..



So what do you guys think? I cant wait to show your replies to him, thank you guys for your time and expertise in helping to educate and inform...

I have no formal medical training. I took a CPR class once, and I don't think you need to take the class to successfully perform rescue breathing. It really helps though. Because of the training, you are repeating steps you already know instead of learning on the fly. 

Let's start with the do list. 

Obviously, if you have narcan, use it. Become familiar with the narcan supplies you have. Learn how they are used and keep them in an accessible, easy to remember location. During an overdose is a bad time to be reading instructions. 

If you have no narcan:

Do check their breathing and pulse. Most people will have a pulse if caught early. You do NOT need to (nor should you) perform chest compressions on someone with a pulse.

If their face is turning gray, or their lips blue, they need more oxygen, whether they are breathing or not. If they are unresponsive, you can also assume they are not receiving enough oxygen. Rescue breathing is important here. (More on that http://harmreduction.org/issues/overdose-prevention/overview/overdose-basics/responding-to-opioid-overdose/perform-rescue-breathing/ )

Do call 911. If they are unresponsive, they need medical attention. Some states have good Samaritan laws that ALSO provide immunity in overdose cases. Not all good Samaritan laws provide immunity for overdoses though. However, its always better to explain an overdose than it is a body. If you don't call 911, you run the very real risk of ending up with a body.

If you have two people conscious, one should call 911 while one breathes for the victim. If you are alone, call 911 first. All you need to say is your address and the fact you need an ambulance because your friend stopped breathing. You don't need to mention the overdose, though if you have immunity in your state you probably should. 

With two people, one can clean up the scene as well. This is not as important as breathing is for the victim. Do not leave anyone without oxygen to try and tidy anything up. With the extra person though, the general rule is ""its better to go home without it, than it is to go to jail with it."" This rule doesn't apply to states with immunity.

If you live in a secure apt building, and have a second person, have them jam open your buildings main door and unlock and open your door. Leave it open a crack, and you save them a lot of time this way.

Things not to do - 

Do not slap, hit, or pour ice/water on the person. This can not help. A sternum rub can be useful when investigating how conscious a person is, but won't help bring someone out of an OD.

Do not inject them with anything but narcan. Amphetamine, saltwater, milk, these are not going to help. (Suboxone? Any clear answers on its effectiveness?)

Do not put them in the shower. This does not help.

Driving a person to the ER is a tough decision. You cannot breathe for them while you drive obviously, and they will not last long without oxygen. If you can stay put and call 911, that's probably the better decision in most cases.

Things I'd like to know/improve on:

Suboxone as a substitute for narcan (no anecdotal evidence please)

Driving to an ER vs. Calling 911 (yea nay?)

Other dos and don'ts. 

There's a lot of misinformation out there concerning opioid overdoses. I wish people were better educated on what to do. Its not something you want to google on the spot, a little knowledge beforehand can save lives.

I'm new here, been lurking for quite some time but thought I'd finally make an account to get some feedback on my current situation. 
So I met my boyfriend at our dealers house a while back. It was an instant connection and it was fantastic for both of us to have someone to talk about our addiction struggles with. He was in much deeper than I was...and had just lost his job and fell into a pretty heavy heroin problem(previously he was just using oxy). So this led to him being kicked out of his house. Of course I welcomed him with open arms to stay with me at my place and we spent a good 5/6 days together just using and being cutesy lovey dovey as our relationship is fairly new. During this time I paid for both of our drug habits and spent several days on a heroin binge(my first time using H heavily...I'm a pill person). I have been using steadily for a couple of years. With months of sobriety here and there. But I have always maintained a steady job and continue to advance in my career. So I'd say I'm a high functioning addict. Anyway, he finally got ahold of his Dad who agreed to pay for him to go to rehab. 
Fast forward to now and he just finished up his 45 days and is clean and sober and I could not be more proud of him. 
However, throughout his stay at rehab we had spoken several times and he asked how I was doing with my using. I said fine of course, I would love to quit but it is now so tied to me being successful at my job that I don't feel as though it is the right time for me to stop. Until I get into a different field or switch schedules or whatever. 
Moreover, I am looking for some advice. I am still using and I don't want to trigger him in anyway so I would be discrete. But at the same time I do not want to lie to him, and I don't think he expects me to quit or anything but I really want him to stay clean and focused on moving forward. I do not want to hinder that in anyway or lose him because of my habit. How do I go about tackling this? I haven't felt this way about someone in years and i know he feels the same.

I guess I'm fighting some serious inner demons, and the dope makes the battle far more enjoyable...even exciting...but I know that this game might land me in jail or in a coffin someday.

I'm not one to judge, but being as the closest I've gotten to a high is some weed in college and a fantastic canoe trip, I'm new to this area. But he said it was in the past, so I didn't think it was a big deal. 

Today, I came over to his place, like I told him I would. Before I came over I called to tell him I was on my way. He sounded weird and upset on the phone. Kept mumbling. I thought he maybe had just gotten off the phone with his baby mama. 

I go knock on his door and I walk in with a smile on my face ready to cheer him up from a bad conversation, and he told me he was high. I asked on what, and he said heroin. I was surprised, but not visibly. All I said was, ""really?"" and then he laid down on his bed and asked me to lay with him. And that's where I'm currently at. Laying in his arms while he enjoys his high. 

Here's my issue. Obviously heroin is probably not the *healthiest* thing someone could do. But I don't control him, and he can make his own choices. But I don't want to enable him in anyway, mainly because he's on probation and has already had 2 DT in a week. 

So how can I make sure I'm not enabling him, while at the same time not nagging/controlling him? Is that possible?

I'm sorry if I sound very naive. Like I said, I have no experience with any drugs other than weed. 

Also sidenote: What exactly is happening to your body when you're high on heroin? Can you feel it? Is it a mental thing? What's going? Also, how long does it last? What happens after the high?

So many questions, sorry. 

EDIT: I appreciate the relationship advice, but I'm not in this for a relationship. Just kind of talking. Friends with benefits sort of thing. I'm curious about the drug itself. 

EDIT 2: Aight, so I can't tell what happening. I just told him I was going to go home, and he woke up and told me he had been napping this whole time. Didn't bring up heroin at all. I'm going to look at his hand when he comes back in from smoking a cigarette (He told me it was his favorite vein. He's talked to me a lot about his heroin usage).  
Now he is known to joke and pretend, and given his humor I could see him doing that. So I may have just tripped out for nothing. Sorry guys, but thank you for the concern and the answers. Y'all are some cool people. And reading through the sub definitely gave me a different outlook on opiate users. ",1467243989.0

That being said, there are a few people in those groups that just want to live their lives in solitude and not lecture everyone about EVERYTHING and I respect them, so this is not directed at you.

I had my first encounter with Narcotics Anonymous when I was 21 and first quitting Heroin.  The people there informed me of the ""12 Steps"" and I immediately hated it but being a believer in don't hate something until you try it, I decided to give it a chance.  So I was sober for 6 months straight.  I was fucking miserable.  I went to meetings & events with these people and they fucking were annoying as shit, and if you didn't see things like they did, they would bully you until you would walk away or pretend to agree with them.  They would gang up on you as well, the fucking fanatics and not let you get a word in edgewise.   For example the higher power bullshit, what the fuck does that have to do with quitting something you are addicted to?

Eventually I got a new sponsor and found out he was doing heroin still.  I hung out with him and relapsed and it was the best decision I ever made.  Not necessarily doing heroin again (this time I IV'd my first time, he was the one that taught me how to shoot up ironically) but deciding I would never be sober ever again because it made me miserable and less productive but also realizing that NA is a cult.  If one has ever been to an NA/AA meeting, one would know what I mean by this.  

In any case, I quit heroin after awhile without becoming a prude.  I am now 23, a college student.  I smoke weed, drink, do pills, and even have an oxy script that helps keep me away from the H because I have chronic pain (One of the main reasons I started H).  Life is alot better.

I noticed there is alot of these NA freaks commenting on this sub Reddit.  Some people have been downvoting my karma because I gave good advice saying to ignore people's bullshit and told a person to follow what his or her heart said to do, not what other people who didn't know him said.  While I am not a mod or admin, I just am going to give my two cents.  Why are these people here?  I see these people that are part of NA as prudes and snitches.  One time one of those motherfuckers got in my face calling me a junkie and brought his buddies around getting ready to kick my ass, and I pulled my butterfly knife and was ready to stick one of them if it came to that.  Luckily it didn't and they ran off like the cunts they are.

So I just would like to advise my fellow drug users and moderators to beware of these people.  I know from fellow experiences how these people are.  I am not saying there is nothing wrong with deciding to quit drugs if it impedes your life, but these people think they should be able to lecture everyone and force everyone to live by their 12 step bullshit.  Hopefully these assholes take 12 steps out the fucking door.

Anyone else have a problem with these bitches?

Edit: I haven't been in NA since 2013 so quit telling me to ""Quit going there"" because I have quit going there.  Fucking retards...",1467241054.0

What's the verdict? (Low tolerance, nasal)","I have read nearly every thread I can find on this and am looking for a verdict as well as some direction for my personal scenario.

I haven't done opana in months and now the only ones available are the uncrushable formula. It is my absolute favorite, for the euphoria. I don't like to nod I like to be active and euphoric and that did it the best I've ever felt. I would probably only need 10mg now. I used to snort it exclusively, never shot up.

What's available are yellow concave E-40's that are 40mg, and the peach 263's that are 30mg. 

So my questions are...

- Do any of the methods for crushing to snort work? Would it be better in my case since I'm only taking 1/4th of the pill?
- I know its a waste, but would it be worth it to take it orally and have an extended release? Would it at least keep me feeling good, longer, even if it wasn't as intense?
- Is plugging an option that raises bioavailability?

So it turns out that catching my first buzz in over 5 months before working a 10 hour shift in the sauna/warehouse that employs me was a bad idea. Nausea, cottonmouth, light-headedness. I will say though that I got a taste of the euphoria. It just wasn't what I was looking for.

Now I'm planning again. When I got sober, I decided that getting rid of all my connects was a good way to help ensure a difficult relapse. I did such a good job cutting all those ties, that now I'm finding it difficult to pick up. I know this subreddit isn't fond of PST posts, but hey; I scored from the grocery store. I didn't get what I wanted from my tea, so now I'm scouring for some real drugs. It'll happen when it happens, I'm not dealing with an obsession by any means. Yet. 

I picked up the seeds from a local mom and pop store where I used to get them years ago to maintain when I couldn't cop. Got everything prepped the night prior, and then actually managed to fall asleep despite my excitement. I woke up about 45 minutes earlier than I planned to, and rather than go back to sleep, I just dosed and got ready for work.

Like I said, the high was alright. I don't know if they started washing the seeds, or if I was just too conservative with the dose, or if I just remembered PST working better, but my itch has just been exacerbated. 

I've had a couple moments of clarity, where my mind screams ""What are you doing??!!! You're going to ruin everything!"" But I think that I'm just being dramatic. Heroin won't be that hard to chip, right?

I've seen my internist about 4 times previous to this.
I've been having severe constant pain for the last ~5-6 months.
First he put me on wellbutin, then two weeks later doubled the wellbutin, then tramadol, then tylenol 3. It takes 3 tylenol 3's to even touch the pain.


Today had a little bit good news and bad news.

Good news : he gave me 50 oxy pills to take when it's really bad.

Bad news : he doesnt understand it's always really bad...the T3's are completely useless.

one pill brought it to a 5, a 2nd pill brought it to a 3...so ill need at least 10mg at a time to be functional...

What do I do?

Do I call back like on friday and say one pill isnt even doing it? Or do I just be happy with what I got. He was a little hesitant about prescribing the amount he did...but it still doesn't relieve the pain.
