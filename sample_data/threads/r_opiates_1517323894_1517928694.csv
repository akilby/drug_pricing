I certainly haven't heard this one yet, but hopefully it's not your first time and can offer some clarity.  I've been on Subs for 8 years now and something odd has happened over the last 12 months that has me freaking out.

The first seven years (or so) I was stable at about 1.2-1.0mg/day without issue.  Suddenly a year ago I started having terrible stomach problems which I can only think was digestive paralysis which caused really bad acid reflux, very poor appetite, etc.  Around that time, I dropped my dose a bit to see if it would help and it did.  Reflux subsided and digestion improved.  However, I ended up right back at the same spot again just a couple weeks later with same 'ol ""taking too much"" symptoms:  not digesting, constipation, sinus congestion, joints not cracking, back pain, low libido, minor headache, too tired, etc.  So I had to lower dose again to steady myself.  This has gone on for 54 charted weeks where I recorded my daily doses and I'm surprised to see that I dropped over 50% from about 6.5mg/week to now less than 3.0/week.  That's right, I'm doing about .5mg per day now in an effort to keep up with what my body is doing, and now I'm at the point that I have trouble getting to sleep, not feeling like I'm taking enough to get through the day, etc.  Each time I've dropped I've had some w/d but lately it's way less intense.  I used to get RLS like crazy but now it's more of just trouble sleeping.  Last week, I lost some hearing in one ear because of how congested I am.  Usually I can drop my dose either for a short while or permanently and the snotfest starts and all sinuses drain.  Didn't happen this time...it's like the w/d aren't even going to start.  

I must be nuts, but are these lower doses that much more powerful?  Or is my brain shutting down not-in-use receptors now?  More importantly, what the hell is my body doing?  Why this forced taper?  It's like I'm fine for 2 weeks after a small drop, and suddenly I'm still on too much.  Could really use some feedback for cause.  The only other thing I take is vitamins and antacid.

I feel like at this point I'm going to have to either stay at a steady dose as long as I can and see if my body re-adjusts (and hope my hearing comes back/sinuses drain/can defecate, etc.), or just try skipping an entire day or two and see if that kickstarts minor w/d because it feels like I wouldn't even get it anymore.   

Anyone out there ever had their tolerance drop automatically like this?  How do I get it back up? ",1517377697.0

He was different from others and he got pain killing plus an energy boost from morphine/h. But that only lasted two weeks.
Any apparent boost in energy the substance was able to provide was only present for two weeks maximum. Then the permanent sleep would start to take hold. 
So although he got energy upon second try, two weeks into the addiction, he was effectively almost permanently asleep. It took him years to learn this only because of how hard the stuff was to get where he was located. 
 He also told me that refined opiates were only mans way to take far too much of a plant that is dangerous enough in its natural form. 
He also told me that bone density loss and hypogonadism are not worth the temporary relief or apparent benefits of even raw opium. Or any of its derivatives.
He was lucky enough to find subutex in a time capsule and tapered off using that once his injuries (the original reason for his use of opioids) healed.

I am NOT looking to vilify the person with this addiction; I am looking to, as always, be honest.  Whenever a character's experience is outside my own (as this is), I want to try to get as much input as possible from people who have the first person perspective that I lack.  So, after checking with the moderators, I wanted to ask you all this question, and you can either post your response publicly or PM me, if you like: How do you perceive the world when you are high on painkillers/opioids?  What changes?  Is the way others perceive you similar or different to the way you are perceiving yourself (and how)?

I get that some people feel that way- The National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse defines addiction as:
“Addiction is a complex disease of the brain and body that involves compulsive use of one or more substances despite serious health and social consequences. Addiction disrupts regions of the brain that are responsible for reward, motivation, learning, judgment and memory. It damages various body systems as well as families, relationships, schools, workplaces and neighborhoods.”
https://www.centeronaddiction.org/what-addiction/addiction-disease
People argued that the addict chooses to try the drug and therefore is responsible for their reckless behavior/they are not victims of an addiction. What about people who get hooked from a doctors prescription-it can be as innocent as a small script after wisdom teeth removal to trigger an addiction. 
So I know how I feel- I have had my own struggles with addiction & watch the show Intervention (I know a watching a show doesn’t make me an expert—- also I have another post about the show Intervention and their work in the Heroin Triangle) and strongly do feel it’s a compulsive disease that needs treatment or over time it can lead to death or other dangerous health issues. I get that to some maybe even most that perhaps comparing addiction to say a child who has cancer who has “no choice” is absurd.

7u3h2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7u3h2o/fda_acts_to_stem_misuse_abuse_of_loperamide/,7,https://redd.it/7u3h2o,UntidyGuy,"FDA Acts to Stem Misuse, Abuse of Loperamide","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced new action today to combat the growing problem of abuse and misuse of the over-the-counter (OTC), opioid-based antidiarrheal medication loperamide (Imodium, Johnson & Johnson), which is placing individuals at risk for cardiac dysrhythmia and death.
To foster safe use of loperamide, the FDA is working with manufacturers to use blister packs or other single-dose packaging and to limit the number of doses in a package, the agency said.
The FDA is asking manufacturers of loperamide, which is available OTC and by prescription, to change the way they label and package loperamide to ""stem abuse and misuse that leaves us deeply concerned,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement.
In 2016, the FDA warned about life-threatening cardiac events, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest, with loperamide misuse and abuse, as reported by Medscape Medical News.  In 2017, the FDA added a warning to the product label about the risk of taking high doses of loperamide. 

The FDA notes that some individuals are taking higher-than-recommended doses of loperamide to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use.
The maximum approved daily dose for adults is 8 mg/day for OTC use and 16 mg/day for prescription use. Loperamide is safe at these approved doses, but the FDA continues to receive reports of serious cardiac problems and deaths with much higher than the recommended doses of loperamide, primarily among people who are intentionally misusing or abusing the product, the agency said.
Packaging Could Help

Evidence suggests that package limitations and use of unit-dose packaging may reduce medication overdose and death, Dr Gottlieb said. Today the agency sent letters to OTC manufacturers requesting that they implement changes consisting of packaging limitations and unit-of-dose packaging.


""We're requesting that packages contain a limited amount of loperamide appropriate for use for short-term diarrhea according to the product label. One example is a single retail package containing eight 2-milligram capsules in blister packaging. We asked the manufacturers to take the necessary steps to implement these changes in a timely fashion to address these public health concerns,"" Dr Gottlieb said.
He said the FDA will also reach out to those who distribute loperamide online through retail websites to ask them to take voluntary steps to help address the problem of loperamide abuse. ""The abuse of loperamide requires the purchase of extremely large quantities. Often this is done through the purchase of large bottles of loperamide, which is a common configuration in which the pill form of the medication is currently packaged. Today's action is intended to change how the product is packaged, to eliminate these large volume containers. We know that many of the bulk purchases of these large volumes are being made online through major online web retailers,"" Dr Gottlieb explained.

I know I have. Burnt by dealers, middle men, cops, other junkies, etc. But has there ever been a time you just fucked yourself and no one to blame but you?

My example or story was a few months ago. I took my lunch break to pick up 2 buns. This was pretty normal. I had taken my break to pick up before, I'm able to do it in the amount of time needed, my guy picked up and was waiting for me. So I go, pick up, do a few on the way back to the train, and get on. Everything seems fine. All went well, right? Well...i get off at my stop and while I'm walking up to the doors, I realize my pack of smokes (which I put the buns in) wasn't in my pocket. I had put the pack in my hoodie pocket. I searched all my pockets like a crazy person, retraced my steps back, and get down in time to see the train pulling away. I realize the pack fell out while I was sitting on the train. Fuck. I just lost 16 bags. They're on this fucking train that just pulled off going to Penn Station. My mind is racing, trying to think what to do. There's a fucking pack of smokes sitting on that train with 5 cigs and 16 bags. I tried figuring out how I could get to that train before they cleaned it or someone swiped them. I thought maybe I could wait for the train to come back and catch it. But how would I know what train? Which car? Which track? There's no way I'd be able to find the right train at the right time AND someone hadn't picked them up already. I had no recourse. Not to mention I had to get back to work, so I couldn't just chill at the train station all day hoping the same train came back to this station. There was nothing I could do and they were gone, traveling the city by themselves on this train, destined to be someone else's high. 

The only thing I could think is ""someone is going to have a GREAT day finding that pack."" lol

SO, I didn’t have access to a vehicle when this all took place, thus I got an Uber to take me into the nearest city (which is approximately an hour away) and had him drop me off at spot set up by my d-boy. After some mild confusion (which actually had my dude laughing at me as opposed to being annoyed/pissy with me, which was nice) I met up with him, picked up my shit, and started back towards a spot where I could easily pick up another Uber to take me home. 

Unfortunately for me, there were ZERO businesses around with a public restroom. And if you think I was gonna wait until I took the hour ride back home to rip into a couple of those puppies then you’re fucking crazy, mate. LOL. So, as I’m tooling around these side streets and alleyways, my dumbass rolls a twenty up into a tooter, rips open 5 bags, dumps ‘em out onto my phone, and then quickly dips beside some rando’s garage and snorts those babies down... er... up. Whatever. 

Looking back on it, I’m pretty damn lucky nothing went wrong! There were people milling about all over the place, so it was quite the “bold” (fucking stupid) move on my behalf.
