I've been clinically depressed for years, without a single day of relief. I also have BPD (borderline personality disorder), chronic anxiety and severe OCD (which affects every single aspect of my life). Please don't mention therapy. I've changed about 10 therapists and I know that it's not about ""finding the right one"". I cannot be fixed. I've been going to different psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists. I've been on Xanax for years. My psych basically experimented with me: he tried on me so many pills that I've lost the count - Rivotril, Prozac, Escitalopram, Adderal, Zoloft and Hydroxyzine being just a few. Xanax is the only one that's keeping me alive. Zoloft made me psychotic and I almost stabbed my roommates and jumped off a roof. The others only made me feel worse. Therapy and counselling hasn't helped a tiny bit either. In fact, they made me feel kinda worse, because I was trying my best but I could not see any results. I am so jealous of people who can snap out of this terrible place with therapy. Also, ""professionals"" in my country don't know shit about mental illness. The only mental illness they've heard of is depression, and no matter what your symptoms are, they'll give you treatments for depression since it's the only thing they know. The most severe aspect of my BPD is the depersonalization/derealization which makes me feel unreal, unable to recognize voices, unable to recognize myself in the mirror, I cannot feel like I have a sense of self and I literally dissociate 24/7. When I tried to talk to my psychiatrists about derealization, they knew nothing about it. The only relief I got was from one single therapist who diagnosed me with BPD and OCD (he was the ONLY professional in 10 who actually knew about mental disorders other than depression) and talking with foreign volunteer psychs about my symptoms. So why do I even bother?

&nbsp;

I think I'm tired of this shit called life. I have two choices: start doing drugs or kill myself. I know I might sound overly dramatic, but I can't cope with the chronic pain anymore. I know it's stupid. But being in constant pain isn't any better either, is it? If I don't do something quick, I'll end up killing myself in less than 3 months because I can't cope anymore. My rose-colored glasses were shattered a long time ago and I can no longer see life the same way or basically enjoy anything in life, like hobbies, music or relationships. So what if the heroin is going to fuck me up? Like I'm not already fucked up, lol. Whatever I do, I'm still going to die. I'll die either by suicide or overdose, in case I start doing drugs. But with H, I'd probably manage to make the last few weeks/months of my life less painful.

Since I know the rules don't allow posting locations or names, I'm going to be very blunt: how do you find your dealers? How do you not get caught and jailed? I literally don't know where to go or what to begin with. Where and how did you find your first dealer? I really need your help since I'm new to this and I feel so lost.",1518616853.0

My little sister OD'd. She passed away at 27 last week. My whole family is a mess. Add to this that it seems some friends she was with may have left her on her lawn to pass away, and it's quite cold here right now. 

I have a question. In a text to a friend, she stated that she was shooting dope and smoking base. What would this kind of OD feel like? Was she in pain? Did she know what was going on? Did she feel cold?

The 'friends' called 911 (we think), then took off and left her there. Nobody attempted CPR. The EMTs attempted narcan and used the AED but she had no heart rhythm. When her 'friend' was there, they saw she was breathing a little. I am wondering if CPR had been performed at the scene if she might have lived.

I was at my dealers house and this other kid was there. He had gotten clean and this was his first time using... And of course he ODs... No breathing, skin turning grey, etc.

My dealer has 2 4mg Nasal Narcans and one .1mg IM Vial. Within 30 seconds and realizing that the kid has gone down, I have the first nasal dose given. Nothing happens after 30 seconds to a minute. I give it a second dose and again nothing happens.

By this point, we are all starting to freak out. Wondering if we're going to have to call 911, etc. My dealer is slapping him, icing him, etc. and about a minite or two later we say f*** it and I IM the dose into his thigh. Within 2 minutes, he is coming too and 30 minutes later he is fine.

Now I know that it could be a dose thing, but I know this kid did a pretty small bow shot and we've tested, and there's no fentanyl in the dope. Typically, in these situations, when I've been around, I've only seen people get one dose and then they're fine. This time though it took 3. As such, in the future, I'm wondering if I need to be leery about the nasal stuff. Like I said, it seem to do nothing until I gave the injection. I know it could be cumulative dosing but like I said before I've never seen it take more than one with such a small heroin dose.

Has anyone else experienced this? Has anyone else seen that the nasal stuff doesn't seem to work well?",1518577778.0

Found this out after randomly noticing my Costco stopped carrying them. The price of them on Amazon is skyrocketing so I think retailers are already beginning the process of getting rid of their loperamide in favor of the 8 packs. The reason they did this is because there were 24 cases of heart issues in 8 years associated with loperamide. That sounds like a really low number to warrant this action, but as we know the government does all they can to ensure you rely on prescription drugs and heroin. Good luck to you guys!

So I am going to ask my doctor about trying out gabapentin since its marketed specifically for nerve pain. I am a college student so I'm worried it will affect me at pain relieving doses which I'm assuming if anything I will get the lower dose tablets and only like 30 since its a trial period. Does anyone here have any experience taking these for pain at normal or higher doses? Does gabapentin reduce mental/brain function and logic and ability to do math/computer coding homework focusing etc. I have bad adhd i take meds for and I need the pain to STOP immediately because its ruining my life and I can't focus for shit.

Also - in case of emergency, if it is all you have, what about Suboxone or even Subutex in a shot or under the tongue...

As a shot, even 2mg of Suboxone has 0.5mg of Naloxone... And 2mg of Bupe isn't gonna OD anyone. Even if the Naloxone didn't hit, the Bupe would replace the other opiates on the receptors throwing the person meanwhile, into Precipitated Withdrawal - and that would be good I think since PW means that at that time, there are few if any, opiates on the receptors.

And even once the Bupe does attach, 2mg would be a low dose. And even in a non-tolerant person, it is notoriously difficult to OD off Bupe - it causes MUCH less respiratory depression than other opiates (and has a better safety profile in general) and the respiratory depression is what you're trying to reverse in an OD.

So yeah - I'm not advocating IMing Suboxone in normal circumstances but in an emergency... Any thoughts on this?

I’ve practically had my life handed to me in a silver spoon and I fucking threw it all away. I was in rehab about a year ago and when I got out, my parents practically babied me because they didn’t want me to relapse. At that point in time I loved my life and wasn’t taking everything for granted. 

Fast forward to now, and I’ve wasted so much of my parents money because I just stopped going to class because I got so caught up in my head and couldn’t focus. I decided to use, despite being on drug court, and got away with it for a while but with only ten days left in the program, I managed to fail one. Now I have to go to jail for idk how long plus time gets added on. 

I finally had to tell my parents what was going on and they just don’t know what to do with me anymore and rightfully so.  I’m going to be cutoff of their money soon, which really should’ve happened long ago because I shouldn’t be such a god damn baby. I made such stupid choices but I was just in a bad state of mind at the time and didn’t have the structure in my life to prevent myself from relapsing. 

All of my friends are graduating college and getting married and just living life. None of them know that I’ve been using and just dropped college this semester but they will find out sooner or later and see what a pathetic loser I am. 

I’m in my 5th year of college and only a junior. I haven’t accomplished anything in forever it seems like. I don’t know what to do with my life. I’ve been in college so long that I’ve just got fucking sick of it. 

My life was so good but I threw it away because I’ve become a weak minded person. I really just want to load up a gram shot but I’d hate to leave such a mess to clean up, literally and metaphorically speaking. I just don’t see the fucking light anymore. I’m going to do my jail time to think about this, but idk if this can get any better

Was in the the middle of some horrendous fentanyl/H withdrawals last night and earlier today. I was bawling my god damn eyes out, feeling as hopeless as ever, anxiety on high, will to live on low. 

My boyfriend (non addict, doesn't use opiates) says he'll be right back his friend is here and has something that might help me. I ask what he says something called clonidine he thinks. I'm thinking meh. Never tried it for withdrawals yet but didn't think it'd do much. 

He comes back with a few clonidine and 6, possibly 7 (I forget) 15mg oxys!!!! Fuck yeah I'm thinking. My boyfriends asking me if this is a good thing, they're only 15mg.. I said it's better than 5mg!! Thinking I'll be cured and maybe a bit high I do em all. It mildly helped. I was able to relax for a bit.. calmed down and the sweating lessened but I was still sick. I've done oxy before but only a handful of times. 

This was like 90/105mgs and it didn't get me well? Should it have? How much would it take you all personally to get well from oxy?

I see everyone's pill posts but it seems they are all different from what we have here. Does the US and Canada have all different brand pills? These ones were a blueish/indigo colour with APO on one side and OCD 15 on the other side. I didn't take a pic I was a mad woman the way I consumed those like a wild boar. 

TL;DR: As a heroin or fentanyl user how many mg of oxy would it take you to get well if you were pretty sick?

-=

If you like you can TL;DR to the end. I'm just discussing my lope experience. I realise, every time lope is mentioned, people chime in with their opinion, others then dismiss or argue. We've have never had an actual survey to determine for how many people it genuinely works for and a scale of effects-to-dose. So, please respond and I will compute the results.


-


-= My Story =-

So, it's the weirdest thing. I have tried lope for withdrawal and I need at LEAST 96mg to take effect. On the whole, it works for 12-20 hours where 95% of withdrawal is taken away. I've never tried it for more than 1 day for fear of severe life-threatening constipation where something may rupture. So perhaps I could use it to taper down by removing 10-20mg a day. 

I find it really difficult to experiment with Loperamide, so I have only used it very sparingly on emergency days and because of the amount of time it takes for me to feel its effects (Every time -
 it takes between 2-3 hours before it begins to take effect.) it's difficult to draw and immediate conclusions or work out if I either do, or will need, need more or less. So I take a known working amount every time straight away. People say thats a high dose, but for me, its not. Thats what it takes to feel 'semi normal' and I have never suffered any ill effects or feelings. 

I don't know why it takes so long and nobody else has ever mentioned it online as far as I can recall. I guess for most people its the same as a standard pill (20-45 mins usually) And I have tried gelcap and instant-dissolve varieties to no difference.

Perhaps its just my chemistry. (Quick Aside: It upsets me when I see users arguing with each other about effects that they don't believe occur in people - but everyone IS different, people process differently and so-called claims of extreme doses or effects from virtually nothing should not be dismissed as hyperbole)

Personally, I believe that lope only works in me after it reaches a 'saturation point' in the blood that allows it to overcome the blood brain barrier protection and cross the membrane to enter the brain.

Yay.. so, now, the moment we've all been waiting for.. Of course, I know just how much junkies absolutely love questionnaires and surveys! it our number one go t... ah fuck it. I just wanna know about your experiences.

**I wish Reddit had a survey function for AskReddit style questions where people could anonymously vote and we could get a more accurate data point for some silly questions. Maybe I could link to an anonymous Google Doc page and build a tickbox survey?**


-


No high-tech survey code built into Reddit, so alas, I may have to tally up whomever posts and put an edit in here.

-


So, I know some people say its a total sham, it doesn't work at all for them.


Some people swear by it, it takes it all away all their problems and could taper off all opiates using it (Damn, why don't they!).


For me, I need what would be a silly high dose for other people to get an effect where after SEVERAL long hours waiting, it gets rid of most withdrawals. Side effects: I'm just a little spaced, colours are super bright and everything is mega in-focus! I ache a bit. But the sweats, chills and nausea are all gone and you bet your ass I don't need a shit! I don't taper because I am worried what that amount would do over a 3-4 day period of time. However, that day I do get is a HUGE win towards clean days, making it easier so I'll take it.

--

TL:DR

--

Collecting results for a survey on lope effectiveness as every time its mentioned its just a bunch of anecdotes and arguments over whether it truly works or people are experiencing a placebo effect as for some people it does nothing, others its a godsend. (I'm in the latter category)

Here are my questions, if anyone feels there should be other questions asked, go ahead and suggest or add the answer to your reply.

My questions: 

----

Lope Dose (mg) 


Time until Lope Kicks In


Duration of Effects


Percentage of withdrawal reduction


Side effects


Cost per Day *and*

7xlawh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7xlawh/when_local_banks_suck/,22,https://redd.it/7xlawh,sloan_fitch,When local banks suck..,"A couple of months ago I went to the ATM with Cliff's card to get money for his dope and the dope he owed me at the time. It was 20 degrees outside so I wore my ski mask, goggles and heavy coat for the bike ride.


Upon arrival I put the card into the machine and I enter the pin, type the money amount I want and wait. The machine spits out a receipt with an error about the pin being wrong. I do this one more times before calling Cliff because I didn't want to enter the wrong pin three times to prevent a lock-out.


The pin was right, so I try it three more times while on the phone. I then suggest that he calls the bank. Well, fucking shitty local bank. You can't even call someone in India to get help at 4AM. 


Oh and on the way home I realized that I left the card in the machine in the indoor ATM area and left my debit card at home so I couldn't re-enter to retrieve it. First I turned around to verify that I didn't drop the card on the ground. Then I had to rush home and back to get my card so that I can enter the vestibule of the bank to get Cliff's mom's ATM card back. Luckily it was so late at nigh/early in the morning that nobody else showed up to use that ATM while I was pedaling my ass off. 

&nbsp;

Cliff called the bank at 8AM when they opened, and all he had to do was create a new PIN. Once done, he took care of the rest and called me at 10AM with good news of success on all fronts. The dboy was ready at 4AM and he was prompt to arrive around 9AM.


The reason this happened was because of a bunch of activity on Amazon, all legitimate activity. They locked the account until the account holder could come to the bank in person to pull money out.

Oh an for the new ATM card, the person on the phone says ""we'll mail it right out."" So Cliff (well actually his mom, it's her card account) asks for the card to be over-nighted to them. The service rep said, ""sure we can mail it out overnight, it'll be $65. We can take the money out of your account if you want.""

&nbsp;


This happened again yesterday/this morning 4AM. If I had work today I'd be super pissed because it would've ruined my sleep. Same reason too. So once again, Cliff's mom has to go to the bank to address this but she can't go until tomorrow because she wasn't feeling well.

I've worked in customer service call centers before and I understand that the rep is faced with some annoying challenges. Following the rules when the leviathan organization that you work for drops the ball is really fucking annoying.


&nbsp;

Key points about the debit card being disabled for security reasons:


* There is no way to prevent this if you use both Amazon Fresh and Amazon prime for items in the same day. Once a a lot of activity occurs, the bank just kills the card.


* The account holder can send a family member to the bank with a check but can only pull out $300 at a time per day until the account holder comes in.


* The bank will do nothing for the inconvenience, which I sort of understand but it still sucks when the account holder is an invalid, needs to order food (and pay for her son's dope) and doesn't own a car. The won't pay for the cab.


* They really dared to charge $65 for overnight shipping on a replacement debit card despite the situation being caused by no fault of the customer. 


* If only the bank simply called the customer on the phone and asked, ""did you do all this shit on Amazon today?"" Perhaps the bank could've maintained notes in their system for future reference, but apparently not.

I have been on Oxy for basically 2 years with only really 1-1.5 years of daily use. It started slow, but now is at 90-180mg daily. It is time to stop, I am in debt, it is fucking me financially, but it hasnt really affected any other part of my life thus far. I have a perfect girlfriend, and amazing support system at home. As well as a great job, sports cars, big truck, own a Garage, etc. 

I have ONE SINGLE Suboxone 8mg film, I plan on using to quit this demon. I also have 2 and a half 8mg Subutex pills in which I hope to throw away. Two days ago was my last dose of Oxy, 30mg in the morning, final dose was 30mg at 3:30pm. 24 hours later, I was feeling minor withdrawal, and I inducted 1mg of sub. One hour later, I felt “normal”. Bone fucking sober, which sucks, but normal. I have been feeling okay, worked 3rd shift all night, slept, just woke up, and now feeling a bit achey like those withdrawal pains, but NOT awful. So here’s my plan. 

Probably take roughly 1mg of Sub film for the next 3 days. (Today, tomorrow, Sunday) and then start to cut them into the smallest slivers imaginable and see if I can manage on .5mg, .25mg, until it’s all gone. At the very worst I have those Subutex as a back-up. Once I run out of Sub I probably will order some good quality Kratom and take that for a week or two, as well as liquid Imodium for stomach issues. 

I figure, at this point, I will be far past the physical withdrawal of the Oxy. Shouldn’t have any physical withdrawal from only using VERY lose doses of Sub for a week. And if I become “addicted” to Kratom, then so be it. I’d MUCH rather trade an Oxy habit for a Kratom habit. Financially and health wise. 

Thoughts? Opinions? Am I crazy? Haha I have done my research and I’m not dumb, I know the Thomas recipe, I know the Robert 325 taper plan.... blah blah... I’m going to try THIS and see what happens. If nothing else it will be an experiment of sorts :) ",1518795577.0

Junkies HAD to get creative. Most of us stole needles from our doctors office or bought them from someone that had a source for needles and at 5 bucks each we even had to learn how to sharpen them using a matchbox striker sandpaper.
The old hype kit was amazing! It 'auto flagged' and worked awesome! To make one is simple and until you have made and used one shut up!! 
First thing to get is an individual needle. Still made and used but mainly for countries that sterilize and reuse them.
A push up stick ice cream. Throw away the ice cream but keep the hollow plastic push up stick. A needle fits it perfectly! 
Next is a baby pacifier, the type that has a ring on the end to help hold it to the big plastic piece that prevents baby from swallowing it.
Use heavy sewing thread to squeeze the pacifier onto the push up stick. Wrap it from the ring about a quarter inch up, tightly so that when finished the pacifier is compressed tightly to the end of the push up stick so that there is no space for the dope to get trapped in.
I always cut the push up stick to no more then 3/4 inch from pacifier to needle.
Twist on the needle and it's ready.
To add water to the dope for spoon cooking just squeeze the pacifier b put the needle in water and release. If you draw up too much water just squeeze the pacifier to get rid of the excess. Squeeze it to put water on the dope, cook it, drop in a piece of cotton, squeeze the pacifier, put the needle on the cotton and release. Once the dope is drawn up, tie off and tap or push the needle in. When you hit a vein it will flag without you doing anything b when it flags squeeze the pacifier to inject as slow or fast as you wish, if you release it will flag again. When it's all in just squeeze again and put the needle in clean water or alcohol and release, when full squeeze it out and repeat until happy that it's clean.
Just as there was a time when there were no computers, cell phones or ANY of that shit there was a time when junkies HAD to be creative! I MUCH prefer the old school hype kit over clumsy disposable shit!!  ",1518794085.0

I'd also like to hear some opinions on my situation and just enjoy the company.

&nbsp;

Before November I was one of the ""I hate needles, heroin is not for me"" types.  I smoked a lot of pot up until around 7 years ago (had the first kid) and have just used drugs very recreationally since then.  Pot when it was around at a party, shrooms if they fell in my lap and the wife and I had a sitter, coke if we wanted to have a bit more fun, but that was about it.  I've tried several other drugs in the past but became somewhat tame in parenthood.  My wife was the same way, but her old DOC was coke.  But things changed about a year ago.

&nbsp;

I had a decent paying job, but at the end of 2015, my location, manager, and hours all changed with almost no extra compensation, just the stress and lots of it.  My wife was able to stay home with our youngest (almost 4 now) but she was going crazy.  She was no longer digging the home all the time housewife lifestyle and our marriage was taking a beating.  Sex became rare which used to be one of our big ways to relieve stress, and neither of us took the initiative to seek therapy or counseling for help.  I turned to alcohol and she turned to spending money and borderline hoarding.  Communication was also becoming strained.

&nbsp;

Eventually, my manager and I had too many disagreements about whether certain practices were ethical and I was tired of bad reviews in spite of being the most profitable employee, so I quit.  I had somewhat discussed this with my wife before I pulled the trigger, but it was still somewhat abrupt.  I had a large savings account and a few prospects lined up, so I wasn't worried, but she was.  More than I realized.

&nbsp;

The end result was I became an unreliable drunk who would sometimes become mean and loud, make stupid decisions like trying to drive, and get so drunk while watching the kids I couldn't safely be the only adult.  I was awful and didn't realize just how bad I needed help.  She tried for a while to help me realize how bad my actions were hurting the family and she tried to get me help.  I went through a detox program after a few weeks long liquor diet, but it became too much for her.  She broke after about a year of my shit.  And just as I was regaining control.

&nbsp;

July last year I had my drinking under control, I basically quit completely.  And June of last year she had one foot out the door.  She stopped coming home most nights at the end of July, choosing to sleep at her sister's, her mom's, her friend's, just not home.  Without my realizing it (I was trying to give her as much space as possible by taking charge of all housework and child responsibilities) she had begun using coke very hard and started trying other drugs without telling me anything.  Communication had ceased.  We were also now dangerously low on money.  

&nbsp;

On Halloween, she came home obviously high on something and passed out as I was putting the kids to bed.  I got worried when I couldn't wake her, so I opened her phone to call who she was last with and of course to see if any of my other suspicions were correct.  Of course, they were.  She had met some guy in September through Tinder, they fucked a few times over a week while she was high on various drugs (coke, alcohol, GHB, pot, maybe others?  She says she doesn't remember) and then he got thrown in jail for drug shit.  She felt terrible and even suicidal about what she had done and hoped I would never find out and started shooting heroin with a friend to stop feeling.  She had been using for about 2 weeks at this point.  

&nbsp;

I fell off the wagon for a bit after learning all this.  She stayed at home now and took care of the kids and left me alone while I slowly died.  Then I found her heroin stash.  She had told me she had quit.  So after the kids were in bed, I brought it all out and told her to make me a nice hit and to inject me.  I didn't really leave any room for a no.

&nbsp;

It was a strange sensation.  It took her a minute to get me registered since she was shaking a little and I was very tense.  It was really strange.  I had no idea what to expect because I had never read up on how it makes you feel.  All my anger, rage, pain, sorrow, and irrational emotions sort of dissolved and I was able to look at her again.  And talk.  While my hit was taking effect, she made and did hers.

&nbsp;

What followed was the most sincere and honest communication we'd had in years.  We stayed up all night talking.  This was sometime in the 1st half of November last year.  And ever since, we've used together and we've begun to slowly heal.  We both think we should still seek marriage counseling and possibly therapy, but it is astonishing.  Nothing just went away by any means.  We're both still very hurt by the other's actions.  I don't know if I will be able to stay with her after she cheated on me.  The thing is, I am able to think about it, we are on good terms, and the only reason in heroin.

&nbsp;

TL;DR:  Two fuck-ups fucked shit up and all seemed fucked beyond repair and could be, but communication is not as fucked up as before and a fucked up drug was the key.

&nbsp;

I'm sorry this turned into such a long piece, but it's the first time I've actually typed everything out.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, we're now totally broke.  I won't be able to make next month's mortgage payment unless I get a job ASAP.  There are also A LOT of details I've left out and a few things modified to make sure no one might recognize this.  I look forward to hearing from everyone!",1518769075.0

I mean do they WANT to see more people die? Because that's how it's done. Ban the safer alternative so people feel inclined to just return to harder opiates.

Its just like crazy to me... Kratom,  while not some wonder drug, does a very decent job in my experience for keeping me mostly away from heroin or pills. It is not nearly as dangerous or deadly as the government likes to pretend it is. It legitimately makes me frustrated because it is a decent cheap alternative to using harder opiates, and a lot of the ODs involved other drugs so the cause of death can't be with 100% certainty ruled as related to kratom ingestion. But the fact that the DEA is even slightly worried about kratom when we have a massive fentanyl/heroin/pill epidemic on hand is just like, insane to me.",1518768415.0

I don’t know if I’m gonna get sick or not but I feel fine. It’s been about two hours since I did the shot. Ahhhh I’m wondering if I’m going to die but I’m also laughing. 

Anyways, what happened.......so usually I don’t shoot. I’ll do it every now and then. We picked up some really good stuff and dealer said try it in a shot it’s amaze balls. So I’m prepping the shot nothing unusual. Used water from a water bottle in the car, which is something that I’ve done before. Made it, and shot dat shit. So fast forward two hours later.......I went to give my pup some water. My boyfriend then asks me “You didn’t drink out of that water bottle did you?” And I immediately said why! He then says that earlier when he gave the pup some water she didn’t end up drinking most of it and he decided to pour what she didn’t drink back in the bottle of water! He wasn’t in the car when I was making the shot because he’s terrified of needles and just doesn’t like it. So he wasn’t able to prevent it from happening. 

Will I be okay?

Sidenote: I did not pull up water out of the bottle and contaminate it with the rig. I wouldn’t have shared the water with my puppers, if I had put the syringe in the bottle. I poured water from the bottle into something else and then used it. ",1518761427.0

When I just went to use now I only had four left. I think my boyfriend stole some when he came over last night and this morning.

Last night I had my pouch in my room when he came back. He just got out of detox. I went downstairs to get us drinks and brought my shit downstairs with me because I didn’t want to trigger him. When I got back upstairs he got upset and said he didn’t like that I did that and didn’t want me to act different or baby him or some shit so I asked him if he would feel better if I brought it back in my room so I did. Now it’s on the table under my tv, his back is to the pouch and table and I’m standing in front of him. We’re making out, and after about thirty seconds I pull back, and it looked like his other hand was behind him, so I pointed it out and grabbed the pouch thinking he took some. He got mad that I assumed that. I couldn’t tell if he did or not, it was zipped but he may have already done it. Whatever. When he leaves I put my shit in my bathroom. So when he came over today I don’t know if he went in my bathroom... but I only had four bags when I looked just now. I feel like I would’ve seen how little I have for sure.
So I took Tagamet at 8:18. Dosed about ten minutes ago. Used my four bags. I’m sweating but don’t really feel high... fucking sucks.
I’ve been going into withdrawals about 24 hours since my last dose. And now I’m out. He should be stopped... so I want to stop with him. Be a healthy couple.

So my endoscopy is in a week from tomorrow. If I don’t use again, should I still tell her I have a heroin addiction but haven’t used in a week? Since the withdrawals will probably be present?

I won’t ask for withdrawal at home tips  because I’m sure there’s tons of threads about it. Maybe links, unless you wanna give me some advice. Or actually if anyone can link me to a good kratom website or give me a good strain.
As far as things I have, I have Xanax and weed and Advil I might be able to get some tramadol from my grandma but stealing from my sick grandma is kinda fucking shitty. I also have gabapentin , I just don’t know how to dose it. Any drinks I can buy? 


Update. I asked him. He took half of my bags.
He used them

I told him he fucked me over
He said I fucked him over

A couple of years ago I was studying for my Masters degree in London when suddenly I had to take a year-long, all-expenses paid sabbatical at the expense of Her Majesty’s Government, owing to the happy discovery of about a kilo of weed, an ounce of MDMA, a bit of coke and several thousand dollars in cash at my flat. Since then, I’ve being working on a book about the international war on drugs that’s taken me all over the world – I’ve recently got back from the Philippines, where President Duterte is basing his approach to law-and-order on the Saw franchise.

Unfortunately budget and having used up all my vacay time means I can’t visit the US anytime soon so was hoping some of you fine folks can help me out. I want to write a section on the opioid crisis in America that’s exploded in the media in recent years and was wondering if people here would mind sharing some of their stories? I’m interested in hearing about: Oxy, fentanyl; how, why and what you use; how taking opiates has affected your lives; the dangers and ODs; the policies under Donald Trump; and any stories or anecdotes you might have.

I’ve been verified by the mods and I don’t wanna get any personal info that can get you in hot water with the cops, busybody moms, etc. Goes without saying but lets keep this in the rules!

So just to begin: What’s your poison and how did you get started? ;)

I have a friend who has gone through some tough times - mostly addiction. She has been clean for almost a year but early in her recovery she met a guy (he seems nice) and they got pregnant.  

Note: she has 4 other kids who she lost custody of.  She posted sonogram pics that had identifying, timely info, was excited though financially insecure.  Not many pregnancy pictures - none that would say she’s definitely pregnant. 

Then at 37 weeks, she and the boyfriend posted that she went into labor and their baby didn’t make it.  They started a go fund me for a funeral, etc. I want to believe her but almost none of her local friends have donated. I’ve moved out of the area and have no way to know if this is all fake.   

If she lost her baby, I want to help. I have the means. But other possibilities are: -lost the baby earlier and faked the pregnancy for this -CPS took the baby  Not even sure what else. I offered to call the funeral home and help pay with a credit card so I‘d know it was legit but she said use it for the go fund me.

7y8r4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7y8r4s/dosing_fentanyl/,5,https://redd.it/7y8r4s,Zorill,Dosing fentanyl.,"Hello,

I have never been a everyday opiate user.  It may be better described as occasional “chipping”, whenever I can get a hold of some hydrocodone or oxycodone from someone with a legit prescription.  I still constantly think of, and crave opiates though.  I’ve always been a avid darkneter and purchased many psychedelics but I’ve been looking at getting 250mg of fentanyl.  The reason is if I get fentanyl I can dose correctly and not risk having cut pills or heroin.  I planned out using a gallon container and using distilled water and mixing all 250mg and that means every 1mL will be about 6.6ug fentanyl and put it in a nasal spray that doses 1mL per spray.  Considering I have zero opiate tolerance would 6.6ug be a safe starting point for 150lbs male with zero tolerance.  


I understand risk of addiction but it’s for legit pain as I crave the feeling of having no pain.

I use a variety of potentiators but I wanted to ask about a few specifically: Tagamet, grapefruit juice and DPH. 

Firstly, From what I understand, grapefruitjuice inhibits the enzyme cyp3a4 which reduces the amount of the drug being converted into its inactive metabolite, nor hydrocodone, allowing more of the active form to circulate and have effect. It’s is also my understanding that Tagamet inhibits the same enzyme. Am I correct here? 

Secondly, it is my understanding that DPH (among other things) acts to inhibit the enzyme cyp2d6 which is responsible for metabolizing many opiates into their more powerful forms (codeine to morphine, tramadol to odesmethyltrsmadol, hydro/oxycodone to hydro/oxymorphone etc...) if this is true, then DPH would seemingly negatively impact all of those drugs, especially codeine and tramadol since their metabolization Is responsible for their subjective effects. And although it may theoretically negatively impact the codones, since those drugs are active in their own right it’s not as noticeable. Am I correct in all this? 

Thirdly, if DPH inhibits the metabolization  of hydrocodone  into hydromorphone, what is responsible  for the increased sedation, euphoria and duration seen when I combine them? I shoot my Benadryl immediately after I eat my tabs for what it’s worth. 
Tell me if I’m on the right track, but If I’m correct in my understanding in the areas outlined above, then my hypothesis for the increased duration would be because the grapefruit juice and Tagamet keep hydro for becoming its useless metabolite, and then the DPH maintains those levels of hydro for longer by keeping it from becoming its stronger metabolite until much later, essentially moving out the dose to response curve, with the tail end of the experience mainly being caused by the hydromorphone that the liver was finally able to produce after all the cyp2d6 inhibitors have cleared out. 

Fourthly, ive been considering incorporating dimenhydrinate, a DPH prodrug, into my routine. Basically adding a longer acting source of DPH to the scheme. From what I understand, dimenhydrinate is metabolized into DPH via the cyp2d6 enzyme, which it then inhibits. Perhaps that is why it’s proscribed at a 2:1 ratio compared to DPH by itself. How would I go about incorporating this drug into the routine? My theory is that its use alongside DPH and Tagamet/grapefruit juice would result in: 
A reduction of hydros useless metabolite by tag and juice, inhibition of hydros stronger metabolite therefore pushing the curve out further by dph in the short term, and further inhibition of hydromorphone production by the DPH formed from dimenydrinate, which would itself be inhibited by all the DPH in the system, resulting in a greatly increased duration. As everything would take forever to metabolize into its stronger form let alone in to its useless form. 

If that theory is on the right track, what would be the best way to stack those compounds? The juice, tag, DOH and dinenhydrinate. Mind you I shoot the DPH and I’m not gonna stop and what I’m doing so far has worked really well but I’m interested in anyone who is more knowledgeable in these things to give me tips and ideas. Would redosing small amounts of Tagamet be a good idea throughout the high to continue inhibition of cyp3a4? Could I shoot the dimenhydrinate at the same time I shoot the DPH? Is that a stupid question? 

Lastly, as a throwaway question, do y’all think proton pump inhibitors like omeprazole would have any impact on drugs like hydrocodone? I know it already crosses the bbb on its own but I was just wondering. I mostly here about using it in conjunction with lope to get it to stay in the cns for longer. Just curious. ",1518892575.0

I’ve had the shittiest luck lately.

I was real dopesick exactly  2 weeks ago and right after I scored, I totaled my car on the icy expressway. Still was sick when I crashed, and I panicked and threw all the dope away. Of course the cop that showed up was cool as fuck too and would not have tried to search me. Just my luck.

Well my cousin’s been driving me to cop lately and today he picked me up while I was super sick. I get these weird stomach movements when I’m sick where I’ll throw up stomach acid. These urges are impossible to fight like I can with normal puking sometimes.

Of course I didn’t wanna throw up in his car, so I went out the window. First time I went out and all the stomach acid just went straight to the back window -_-
Second time, my glasses flew off in the wind onto the highway.

I guess it’s not even as much bad luck as me just being a dumbass. My glasses have been loose and fucked up lately and missing one of the nose pieces, but I figured I’d put off getting them fixed as long as I needed to. Looks like I’ll just have to get a new pair now. Lol. Fuck.

And the worst part of this all (of course my junkie mindset tells me this is the “worst”...)
is that the real strong dope in my area is gone. And the dealer is lying and saying he has it even though his stuff sucks now.

About tolerance this time.,So today is currently Saturday and On my guys lunch I’m picking up a 30. As of this past tuesday a 30 was a little more than I needed but I still took the full thing. then on Wednesday night I tried to just do a half and honestly felt next to nothing. Just very mild stuff not even warmth or anything. Now I know everyone is different but you think after not doing anything since Wednesday that’ll be enough time for a half to be enough? I usually always just try to stick to a dose that I know works as to not have shit days like Wednesday lol but I’d like to go back to a little lower tolerance (I know even 30mg isn’t a high tolerance at all)as 30s are hard to come by and are really expensive in small town.

I am afraid the temptation to bang one just to see what it's like is becoming more irresistible. 

so... on the off chance that i do decide to do it, can i get some tips regarding dosage / anything else you think might be important. i will google how to prep but i want to get some first hand suggestions from you guys as to dosage for a first timer with low tolerance. 

i have been using seeds for the past couple of years fairly irregularly so i have not developed much of a tolerance at all. 10-20mg of oxy typically gets me to where i wanna be with the ones i have at the moment. 

i have 10mg instant release capsules. how much of one of these should i use?

i have done my research on the addictive side of IV so if you want to warn me just know that it might be a waste of energy. i really just want to make sure that if i do do it that i don't take too much and have a bad time or die. but on the other hand if you feel strongly about trying to persuade me not to do it well go for it i won't mind.

one reason that i am fairly confident that i will be able to control my use is that i do not have access to more pills once these ones run out. it's very hard to come by without a prescription around here and i do not have friends who fuck with this shit

thanks guys much peace and happiness to all

its clear now that i am a lifer of opiates, after having tried quitting suboxone after being on it for thirteen years, 9 years straight.

I brought my dose down to 1/64th of an 8mg tablet.

7 days later the withdrawal and pain oonly got more intense.


Around this time my TMJ continued to get worse and worse and worse.

So at this time i am most likely going to make the switch from suboxone back to a regular ass opiate that actually kills pain. Suboxones pain killing effect is more along the lines of masking the pain not actually getting rid of it. It does an awful job at it. For very minor things, yes, Suboxone acts like the motrin of Opioids, and same to the intolerant, its proably grandiose. I digress: ITS NOT USED FOR PAIN.


I ahve been in pain for 6 years straight. I have tried countless meds, and therapies. Opioid treatment , something id never thought id be doing, is my last option. 


On a daily basis i feel like my head is being crushed to sum it up. I have extreme jaw pain that radiates into my inner ear canal and through both my upper and lower jaw as well as their teeth, causing my teeth to crumble.

I have not seen my primary doctor but 2 time as i am kind-of afraid of both doctors, and doctors dismissingme because i am on suboxone. I have had this happen before and it makes me want to cry because you feel helpless. Most doctors do not even care, once they realize that you take Suboxone. One even told me this outright.


TL;DR



**What is the best opiate for jaw/facial pain**

**wat is the best opiate combination for jaw/facial pain i.e. if it comes with tylenol, motrin, or something else like naloxone (which in the right proportions actually INCREASES the efficacy of the drug,.**


**...i dunno what to do anymore**


suicide & death have been on my mind a lot because i am in constant pain. 

i love my life and i am a very positive person but i cannot take the pain. 


i would love to me admitted to the emergency room , to have a stay over night so they can properly address my meds & help me with my pain  , but i do not know if this is even possible.


Thank you for reading and have a beautiful day",1518873886.0

I'm 20, and I happen to have a few 10mg Oxycodone pills at home. I'm super curious about the drug's high as I never experienced anything other than weed or alcohol. 

I'm considering trying it but I'm also worried about the obvious addiction risks. Basically - **How good is Oxycodone?** Is it like heroin - when you do it and you *know* this is the best feeling you will ever experience in your life? Will I be like ""wow, life is boring now""? Or is a one-time use not that bad?

How addictive is it - from one time, assuming I have access to more pills, will I get physical cravings?

I hope this isn't pissing anyone off - I know opiate addiction is not something to fuck around with and I'm not here to offend anyone. I'm just really fucking interested and at the same time I'm very prone to addiction so I'm hesitant.

7y5zhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7y5zhs/wowsnorting_tar_is_strong/,13,https://redd.it/7y5zhs,Wowziersgray,Wow...snorting tar is STRONG,"Honestly, I’ve always thought that tar was a waste of money even though it’s half the price per gram as ECP (moved from east to west).  However, I recently mixed my tar with glutamine powder with a ratio of 1:1 and GOD DAMN GOD DAMN, it’s beyond surprisingly strong.

I’ll link a pic later of the lines I was doing and what it looked like, color wise.  

But yeah, I mean tar is $80-100 a gram for the good stuff where I’m at, and I bought 3 grams for $220. I have no tolerance as I haven’t partook in 7 months.  Smoking it, as I had remembered, took around a point to produce some good hits and a discernable high.  However, I did the pill bottle penny technique using a point of the tar resulting in 200mg of 50/50 greyish heroin.  I racked up a small, 30-40mg line, and within 5 minutes I was buzzing hard.  And the high lasted twice as long as when smoking.

Yeah, it stung a bit but, really, nothing too bad.

Now I love tar! It’s so freaking cheap!  Again, I got 3g for $220 and using the 50/50 cutting, it produces 6 grams of really heavy hitting snortable heroin!

It’s still tar, so it’s still less of that euphoric and energizing high that I got from ECP, but it’s a fraction of the cost and has longer legs.

Anyway - the reason for this post - has anyone else had this experience?? That when snorted, tar is crazy strong and even cut, is just as potent by weight as good afghan powder?!

My only guess as to why is that Mexican tar is rarely cut heavily due to it’s strange texture and is typically more “pure” in terms of percentage of general opiates because it contains like three or four more things than just heroin (diacetylmorphine).",1518863923.0

The train car was packed, commuters pressed against one another and swerving with the train’s motions like things headed for storage.


The snot is flowing now, a thousand floodgates cranked open. Bearded men with wooden leg prostheses roaring through the tempest of crashing mucoid waves, Melvillian characters stoically braving the storms of early withdrawal. Chills, sweats, restless legs – it’s all par for the course and you really shoulda learned last time God damn it. In this numb nuts’ mind, the term “dopesick” never did it justice. It’s more than a mere flu spin-off, it is concentrated despair, waking up to bells tolling gloomily in the distance, it is you scrounging for all the obtainable firstborns in ripe sacrificial age to propitiate the dope gods.


Timidly breaking through however, like a frail sun on a cloudy day, our sad excuse for a protagonist surmises The Meet, where he will be given The Remedy. The Stop - the doors groan open with a vaguely flatulent hissing sound and vomit passengers on the platform. Our quote unqote hero whips through the masses with the verve of an overzealous conquistador in a New World jungle. He hooks lefts and rights like a rabid rat in a maze; his lizard brain has taken over and the route requires no cognitive effort anymore. On a nearby corner, he spots his dealer and can you believe it this pathetic worm actually does that thing when you see someone you really like at a distance and automatically start smiling awkwardly and start focusing your vision on the floor or a point behind him not daring to fully commit to meeting the other guy’s gaze until the final moment right before the hands shake.


Like ripping off a band-aid, the idiot leaves with dope in hand. Now to go home. Now to unlock the door carefully and nauseously giddy and place the works and product on his desk like a deranged priest preparing Communion. Now to probe for a vein, now to feel the subacoustic pop of a needle and observe the crimson flood streaking through the barrel, the knucklehead in awe at the resulting color. This’ll hurt just a little except it won’t at all and it will tether you to a shit-colored nasty sludge for the rest of your life God willing.

I've kicked cold turkey for days many times so I know this is no where near what the suffering *could* be. But, as anyone who's tried a taper knows, when you decrease your dose by a huge percentage, you definitely friggin feel it.

And the mindfuck element is so brutal. Having more sitting right there, that I'm saving for the rest of this taper... bags of freshies, sterile saline, shit to do...

The biggest mindfuck of all, the part that really makes me hate myself, is that today on day 2 of half dose (well first went down from .7 g to .5, and now day 2 of .25), I actually physically feel... ok. Not great but not really very sick anymore. My body's acclimated. But my mind... ugh... I don't even have such bad depression as I did yesterday.

And also just to give you an idea of how hard it is to see I have to close my left eye and squint really hard ima try and turn down my brightness . . . . . It kind of worked lol. Back to the story when we got home we cut it in half in then I realize my friend is already kind of fucked up. And I know the dude we buy from usually hooks him up and me also because we’re tight so I then go to he bathroom and what do you know I find a credit card with h on it and a dollar bill rolled up and a lotto ticket with a lil bit of powder left too! And I know he got this for free because it was all the money we both had. So while this dude nods out and is snoring.i do my line and his line. Then cut out another line did it . Put it under his dresser that he always puts it under .  Then I waited a couple of minutes tried to wake him up for about 10 mins he finally woke up we did the rest . He didn’t even notice how little there was lol. Now he’s asleep and I’m nodding out writing this post . Judge me if you want but I think I did what I felt was right .

For a better part of 11 years I have only been able to shoot in the deltoid muscle of my right arm.  

I can only use one hand (the left) and I cannot do shots in my thighs because of the insane muscle spasms in my legs.  I shoot 1ml.  I only use brand new rigs and needles and I always use alcohol prep pads to steralize the injection site and to sterilize the vial.  I use 2 different needles 1 to draw the med and the other to administer it.  

Now I'm have *severe* pain in the front side of my shoulder.  It is excruciating to lift my arm up.  Here's the rub... I didn't do any trama to my arm.  The god damn thing is a fucking paperweight.  I only have 1/4 feeling on that side of my body and for me to feel this much pain is I have no words.  This pain is in the arm I inject into... There is minimal swelling on the side of my pec nearest my armpit.  Can this be the beginning signs of infection?

My doc gave me 12 T3s for 9/10 level pain and an antibiotic....

Understand, I have a mechanical aortic valve and take blood thinners so this tooth isn’t getting pulled for at least seven days. That means over a week of living with a throbbing painful puss filled mouth blister and only codeine to comfort me.  

I took eight T3s over a period of three days and called her yesterday when my pain spiked again. I was in tears and left a message which she returned just before her office closed. She said she’d send a stronger script to my pharmacy and made an appointment with a dentist in the morning. 

I jumped in the car and high tailed it to the drug store only to find 30 more T3s waiting for me. I was fucking irate. That bitch played me.  

Fast forward ten hours, 4am and the right side of my face is swollen and my head is on fire. I’m pacing the living room, waiting for 8am to come so I can see my dentist, while imagining horrible death scenarios involving my physician and writing sharply worded letters in my head to her, her boss, the FDA, the DEA...

Despite the unmanageable pain I’m  really trying to TAKE THIS SHIT AS PRESCRIBED  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE but I breakdown and eat about six of the T3s no CWE and an hour later, I fall asleep. :)

Morning comes and the dentist says the tooth has to go, which I already knew. We get to know one another well enough during the examination that on my way out the door he hands me a script for twenty 5/325 Percocet. 

I fucking love him, but I suppress the urge to hug him and head back to the pharmacy, for a third time this week where I’m lectured about the dangers of combining Codeine and oxycodone but I know better. 

The counter of this pharmacy is decorated with antique glass drug bottles, some with original contents still intact. I always mean to snap a photo of their counter to post here because this the only place I know where it would be appreciated as much as I appreciate it.

I know Codeine is a pretty shit high compared to others. 

I’ve used a hand full of opiates over the last 5-7 years mostly oxys, percs and Ds even smoked dope once or twice (never used a spike and don’t plan on it) but usually really low doses compared to some bigger habits, I never developed a habit or really used on my own would just snort Roxie’s and Ds, eat the percs because I didn’t want to fuck my nose up with all the extra shit. I admit I have an addictive personality but ive never fell much into opiates so I’m blessed to be able to enjoy them pretty rarely, I don’t seek them. Today i ran into like a 30x I think, Teva 15mg Codeine pills, they’re tiny and yellow with an imprint I think a letter and 2 digits, don’t have them with me but I know they’re 100% scripted out of the UK. Anyways wondering what you guys would think a good dose is? I did like 90mg today but I felt sick from some bad food I’m assuming or something because I had a head ache before I took them but I ended up with an even bigger headache and pretty buzzed but I regretted wasting a decent high. Still have more though. Felt weak and almost nauseous really. I know that can be common but essentially was wondering if that was too big of a dose or should I assume it was feeling shitty earlier and leave it at that? I know it would only be assumptions but since you guys have probably dealt with this more than I have I found this sub to be appropriate. There’s always good harm reduction here. I’m mid 20s 140-150lbs male if that helps you guys. Is 90mg with a reset tolerance (months without a pain killer smoked a tiny bit of H, like 50-150mg in one day and got sick as fuck it was nice dope) too high of a dose for someone my size? I’ve been told 100mg max starters and other told me they’ve done 200-300mg and that seems like ENTIRELY too much for a first time tolerance situation, you can always take more but never take back what you took.

T🕖🕗 L🕘NG DID🙅‍♂️N🚫T R📖🅰️D


When should I take sub before/after getting high? I know it’s no problem if I just stay on the sub, but I’ve been skipping a day before I get high. I won’t have PWD, will I? The bupe is prob still in my blood, right? Then I can just dose more sub when I’m done getting high. Also, more specifically, I just sniffed 2mg. Going to get high tomorrow (and the next few days). I actually feel pretty decent. Should I save the other 2mg powder I had crushed up then? I don’t wanna block the precious heroin tomorrow night lol


 So I’ve been on subs legitimately for a little over a month now. Did about 30 days totally clean of other opioids, did have a little crack binge and I’ve been messing around with powdered etizolam like a GENIUS. 


I wasn’t really against doing drugs, I actually quit for my gf at the time who then dumped me literally the day I got on subutex. Yeah. Came home after all that to find a $410 settlement check I wasn’t expecting and didn’t do anything to deserve (thanks Adderall XR!) and somehow I STILL didn’t go out and relapse. Because my mom was the other thing keeping me clean.


I really only need my mom to THINK I’m clean though, and I’m on fucking prescription opioids anyway. We’ve always been kind of don’t ask don’t tell and now that she found out about the heroin problem she’s doing more asking. I still have plenty of time and resources to do what I love, though, which is to get high on heroin and cocaine. 


Everyone esp online made it sound like I wasn’t gonna be able to get high, or like if i could it’d take a whole gram shot or something. Well, I happened to skip a day before I saw my boy, he racked me out two fat rails of ECP and also passed me, a few times, a sweet little handheld dab rig that worked really well for tar. Pretty much heaven for this “recovered” junkie who went from all day everyday to being able to actually wait and save and get high like I really want, when I deserve it. I’m learning how to be a functional deviant. It’s pretty amazing, really, because even two months ago I wouldn’t consider not doing what it took to get high each and every day.

Anyway, I wasn’t really ON sub when I got high before, but I was enough to not go into PWD when I took the sub again later. I anticipate a little more blockage this time because I’ll have dosed around 30 hrs prior. Should I take small amounts of bupe each day while I’m on this little vacation? I’ll prob be getting high about 5 days in a row. Is that long enough that I’d have to do the whole sub induction thing again?

I need your help confirming if this is a Naltrexone pill or not. It was a free gift from an online friend among other stuff, but I haven't used it for months because the lack of markings bothers me. We're not in contact any more so I can't ask him where he got it from.

One side is scored and the other is just plain no markings.

Has anybody ever seen or used an unmarked naltrexone pill? Perhaps it's from a country like India and came in a blister pack, hence why there's no markings? I'm only even considering it because it is orange, the proper color, and because I'm using it for ULDN. If it's inert or something else entirely, I doubt 0.2% of the pill can cause adverse effects.

Thoughts? I know I could just buy more, but if the blister pack tablets are unmarked then it's likely legitimate.

I was arrested the other night after picking up I stopped at a gas station and before I could even go inside I set my gps and texted back a few friends, i go to get out and 2 cars roll up blocking me in and hit me with flashlights, they told me to stay in the car and came up to me asked me why I was there and I said I was going to get something to eat inside then get gas on one of the pumps, they asked me to step outside and they searched the car and found a bag of loose dope and 2 more stamp bags, they brought me in and I didn't say anything to them. I was In this holding cell and kept asking what we were waiting for and they said my charges were pending, hours later they finally say they got them and it's two accounts of possession. They booked me and then I was told I had a bond of 2,500 and someone had to bring 250 but after my buddy that I had called and left a voicemail with called back they said he could pick me up and they would just give me a promise to appear so I just had to show up at court and my buddy didn't have to pay a bondsman. 

I was arrested when I was 18 for possession and I went to court and the district attorney told me he was giving me a pre trail drug education program to take and it was 15 classes I had to do once a week and then I would have to do 40 hours of community service and come back in a year and I would get it dropped, I did that and they dropped the charges, I never had to take drug tests or had probation so I never really stopped using, it was on and off for a while then a long break until 6 months ago I started using heavily again. Im 20 years old now and the court date they gave me is for 2 weeks from the arrest date.

Now here is what's freaking me out, I've been checking pending convictions online every day and they just showed up yesterday and they didn't charge me with possession they charged me with two accounts of possession with intent to distribute. They never told me this and I'm scared shitless because Possesion is just a misdemeanor here and with intent is a felony so I have 2 felony charges pending against me. My dad left years ago and my mom isn't really competent so I'm on my own with this one. I would get a lawyer but I can't afford one, last time I was at court they said I wouldn't be offered a public defender because i didn't need one, I'm guessing they will probably offer one to me this time

I'm just really scared because I'm still pretty young and I have wanted to stop this shit for a long time but I'm afraid of what the outcome is going to be and that I'm going to have a felony for the rest of my life and that would fuck me up majorly
Any advice or expiernces of getting arrested with these charges or anything similar would be appreciated immensely
Thank you so much 

TL;DR I am 20 years old and was arrested with two accounts of Possesion which is what the cops told me but later found out through the judicial website that it's two felony possession with intent to distribute charges, what should I expect to happen and is there anything else I should do? First court date is in 6 days ",1518818025.0

You were depressed, or had some form of ptsd or life trauma that pushed you to drug use, yet every single person who has gotten clean for more than a few months says that they’re finally “happy again” or whatever, that it “gets so much better when you’re free from your addiction.” How is that possible? To me, that’s like saying that someone who is suicidally depressed can just pick up a heroin habit and when they get clean all their previous problems will have disappeared. I guess my question is how exactly do you mean you’re happier? Is it just that with an addiction you still have the same problems so you go from bad to worse and going back to just bad feels almost normal then? Or does getting clean somehow really allow you to be happy again?",1518815519.0

I took about 3 mg over a few hours on Wednesday. I took about .5 at a time, because I felt like it wasn't working. I think I may have had somewhat of PWD's- it wasn't unbearable, but I did not get well from the sub. Whatever, toughed it out, and the next morning I took about 1mg, maybe a little more. It worked, but again, I still didn't feel 100% like I usually do when I take sub. Later on in the day I took about 2mg before bed, and it still didn't get me fully well. I woke up not even 12 hours later feeling restless and kind of sick.

So, this morning I took about 1mg. I STILL didn't feel that good this morning after that sub. So I've taken about 5mg over the past few days, so it's obviously in my system. 

I don't know why the induction has been so rough- it's never been like this before. Usually I am good after 1mg for a whole day. But I don't know what the problem was this time. If I had PWD's, I don't see why 48 hours later I would still not be feeling relief from sub. 

So, today, I ended up getting some dope. I did about a bun and a half over the past few hours and I finally felt relief. I didn't think I would feel the dope after all that sub, but I did, and still do. 

Now, my questions are why I had such a tough time inducting, and how to avoid having this problem tomorrow. I want to continue taking sub, don't want to use, but today just happened as it did and that's that. I know that I want to stop so I am not getting discouraged. But, I want to know if I should still wait 24 hours til I really feel sick, or if I can just take sub when I wake up to avoid having cravings and all. I obviously have sub in my system, so I'm wondering if doing dope and getting high was just luck, and that sub is still going to be attached to my receptors and I won't get PWD again if I take it after 17-18 hours when I wake up.

She knows of my addiction. She's the only family I have left. She volunteers to feed the homeless and knits hats and mitts for them in our harsh Canadian winters. Whenever asked for change she gives a 5 or a 10, doesn't care what it's used for just wants to help. She'll buy me a pack of smokes or something to eat when she knows I'm broke, though I'd never ask. She's never touched a drug in her life besides the odd glass of wine. 
She was prescribed percs for her back pain. Not super severe pain, just occasional. Of course this made me nervous but I know she's in pain and needs help. After about a year of taking her prescription she sat me down and told me she was addicted, she was taking them everyday at higher doses than prescribed- regardless of her pain levels. 
I told her to go to her doctor to ask them to ween her down and possibly switch her to something else after. The doctor was no help. Told her to use what she had left to do it on her own and cut her off. I was furious! I offered to help her ween off, since I had experience with this kind of thing, she declined. She took a few withdrawal tips from me but that's about it.
She went cold turkey and dealt with some shit! I mean, she was 75, dealing with withdrawal on top of arthritis and other conditions. 
She now uses Tramadol and never abuses it! Only uses it on her really bad days.
I'm so proud of her, thinking of her story gives me hope! We got her a new doctor and she is much happier with this one after the way the last one treated her.
Just wanted to share this amazing woman's story! If she can do it so can we!

Anyways, I was with a friend, and he said I was acting weird; walking around, had a strange look in my eyes, and wouldn't respond when talked to. so after about 15 minutes of coaxing he managed to get me to say yes to calling a bus.

 *time passes..*

EMS and police arrive. 6 paramedics, and 10 cops. Count them, 10!! So before EMS Narcan's me, apparently one officer grabbed me and picked me up 1by my shirt (I was sitting down, and not responding but still alert and eyes open) picked me up, and shook me pretty violently.  Now if I wasn't blacked out at the time that alone would've made me steaming mad.  To top it, according to my friend, when they hit me with the Narcan, two cops started laughing and said ""Oh no! There goes your high you damn junkie!""

To top it all off the ridiculous amount of cops started trying to illegally search his house, which is rented by other people as well. My friend had to cause a scene and start getting their badge numbers, et cetera, and that made them back off.

Seriously? If I had been concious enough to respond I definitely would've snapped so hard.

Been feeling pretty decent on average but my finances are in shambles. As of this writing I have to come up with $70 for my mortgage. We received a notice of default and we went and talked to them (small local mtg company) and they agreed that if we can pay them $300 every month that we'll be good but that, and i quote, ""god help you if you're late"".

Now I'm just $70 away from that goal and simply don't know how the hell we're going to swing it. I have until Monday and I'm freaking out here. The point is that just because you're clean doesn't mean everything just falls into place. Life still happens to the clean and unclean alike. I don't believe in karma, per se, but I really try to keep up my end of things in regard to helping folks out when I'm able, doing stuff for the neighbors, etc but *damn* sometimes I wish things would swing my way once in a while. Ya know?

It's really frustrating doing everything right and *still* being behind the eight ball.

Stay safe out there and here's to not having to hustle ever again.

**UPDATE** - /u/marines691 and /u/prettyhatemachin have offered to split the difference that I'm short on the mortgage. Unfortunately, the company is just a small local business and doesn't take credit cards. I PM-d them both that I wouldn't expect anyone to send me cash (this is after all, /r/opiates ) but thank you for the amazing offers! 

That said, I'm in full on panic mode at this point ;) I'm going to try to hit up my boss for the difference as he helped me previously but he was pretty uncomfortable doing it the first time. I'm going into it expecting a ""No"" but who knows? Maybe luck will be on my side.

I hear that term thrown around a lot and I think it's true but inevitable. If we didn't have a ""romantic"" view of dope we wouldn't dig our lives into the ground over it. Speaking of digging your life into the ground, hold my shovel, I'm an expert on it. For everyone who thinks dope is romanticized buckle up because I'm about to un-romanticize the shit out of it. 

Addiction is a load of bullshit. In so many ways, and so many of those ways I'd never thought of. Sleep is impossible when you're in WD but no one mentions how little sleep you get when you're using daily. Staying up late fighting with yourself for another shot or to save it until morning. Waking up hours before work to score because you didn't save for morning. Missing that shot or getting bunk and being sick by the end of the work day anyway. Having two jobs but not being any richer for it. Ive never been suicidal but there's a post on my commute that I see and every day I dream about hitting the gas and aiming straight for it.
 
Now let's talk about stigma for a hot second. That term is thrown around too but what does it mean? It means that even the people who are kind, who understand, they'll give you a sad pathetic look when you're buying rigs. Even the friends who stick around give you a look of pitiful concern like you're a shelter dog when you respond to any ""how are you"". 

Dope is the most euphoric drug right? Then life is the opposite of that without it. Hellish anhedonia. My buddy's drummer broke his wrist and I substituted for a house show. The energy of a show used to get me hella fired up on life but I couldn't wait for it to be over because I'd rather nod out on the couch and watch infomercials. I even made my friend pay me for the favor, pay me for shitty passionless drumming, because I'm an asshole now. 

I don't know where this phrase originated; if it was AA dogma or the words of a wise street junkie. ""You have to want to quit before you can succeed at being clean"" (I paraphrase). I believed that. I threw caution to the wind because one magical day the gods of sobriety would piss on my umbrella and I would quit, easier then an easy-bake oven. Do I want to quit? I guess. Do I want to go through withdrawals? No. Can I spend the rest of my life knowing I'll never touch dope again? No. Can I do anything but live in the moment? No. Can I turn off my junkie autopilot? No. My love of dope and my hatred of addiction causes too much cognitive dissonance for me to be remotely rational.

Welcome to storytime with psychonaut424! Today we will discover a story about a dipshit who decided to insufflate a stupid amount of DMT and how he was a dumbass for doing so! Once upon a time there was a man named ""Insert name here"". He loved to trip balls when he was 17. One night he did some DMT. A normal monthly occurrence for him. He only snorted 100mg of the substance and the trip went off without a hitch.

Then the next day, dumbass, decided to snort 300mgs of DMT right next to his scary ass lookin dog. Once he did it. His nose began to bleed... And before he could notice...he had peed. He has a mild seizure and then he flies across the house spinning around goes into the bathroom and puts his face into a toilet. Remember he needs to breath he takes his head out of the toilet and lays on the bathroom floor for 45 minutes. he wakes up out of nowhere like as if he was in a trance. And then he realized he had shit his pants. Feeling like crap, fuckhead, went to his room and shot some dope. Then he was okay. (yes shitheadfuckface washed himself and changed his clothes first)

okay guys i hope you liked that story. This is actually a true story that happened to me back in my hippie days. I did shit myself and put my face in a toilet but thats almost all i remember. I tried to make the story kind of funny buy probably failed at doing so. Hopefully you all can at least get a laugh at what happened to me way back when.

I've gotten boils at injection sites for a year and a half, ever since I had a couple of abscesses. Omce they healed, these boils started popping up. Didnt matter if I missed or not. They've since mostly gone away and I might get one every few months but I don't have 10-15 on my body at any given time. There were two major factors in eliminating them : a) many rounds of different antibiotics that would always work for a week or two but then the boils would return, until finally, I tried one that got rid of the boils for good. b) (and heres my tip) witch hazel. 

Witch Hazel has helped me so much. After every shot I clean the area with it, especially if theres a histamine reaction or any sort of immediate swelling or itchiness. If you don't know witch hazel is an anti astringent that not only cleans your skin but helps reduce redness, swdlling, burns, cuts, scrapes and just basically any irritation at all. By using this directly after a shot when there was a lot of swelling (that for me wouldn't go away and would turn into a boil) would actually get rid of, or make it shrink drastically so that there was nowhere (or very little space) for pus and therefore a boil to form. It obviously also cleans the area without irritation like iso might. But the best part is that you can use it for more than just clean up, for anyone into skincare it can also be used as a toner and it does a wonderful job at this too. I originally bought it to use as a toner but when reading the bottle I saw it was meant to help inflammation so I tried it on a few areas and I saw a change immediately. Now I know most people don't get swelling or boils each time they do a shot, but I know a lot of us get histamine reactions every so often and swelling if we miss and witch hazel is great for when those things happen. 

Now theres never a time I dont have at least one bottle in my house, its become a staple in my routine and I just thought I'd pass it along. Hopefully it can help some of you like its helped me!",1518928280.0

I didn't really feel withdrawal symptoms but I just didn't feel as good as I know I could have later in the week and that fucks with my head.

Yeah I would have some trouble sleeping but it's 95% in my head. Several days afterwards I feel it leaving my body completely and from that point forward I just have mental cravings.  I might have 2 nights of not sleeping that well but that's about it. 

What's difficult now is the cravings. When Mondays come around I still feel anxious and have cravings harder than any other day of the week. I use to have a habit of staying up Sunday nights because I was so exited for Monday morning. Now I still have trouble sleeping on Sunday nights and Mondays I still get the mental cravings and anxiousness. 

I guess it goes to show how the biggest battle is in the mind.

Then yesterday I took 4mg of suboxone before work. Went from the very early stages of WD to feeling fine within the first hour of my shift. Later that night, despite having gotten out of bed at 2pm, I had no trouble falling asleep before or by 2am. As many know, subs tend to make it easy to cop lots of sleep and I sure did get eleven hours of it.

&nbsp;

Somewhere in the middle of my sleep I woke up and my shirt was soaked with sweat. The same way it has been in the past when I was in withdrawal and had nothing whatsoever (no drugs, no dope, no subs). Of course this time I did have some bupe in my bloodstream and brain.

&nbsp;

No RLS, no significant gastro effects. Just a sweat soaked shirt. I've noticed this in the past as well. It seems to me one of two things is happening. Either I'm very warm because of the suboxone and being under a comforter causes me to sweat while I'm fast asleep or my body is doing what it would normally do while withdrawing from dope. 


If it is the latter, then of course the sub is keeping me mentally well while my body physically reacts to the lack of dope. First dump du jour was a little wet so that also matches WD symptoms.


Personally, I rather be too warm and sweat than be too cold and dry. In the past someone suggested that I sleep with the window open or not use so many blankets so I wouldn't sweat but frankly I'm more comfortable being too hot. My thermostat runs low even before I started fucking with this shit.

I found myself a buprenorphine/naloxone 8/2mg pill, and wanted to hear your thoughts on dosage - I rarely take any opiates, at most a rare 5-15 mg hydrocodone to feel a nice little buzz. So I'm somewhere between opiate naive and very low tolerance. I also weigh about 180 lbs.

From what I've read so far, it seems a good idea would be to snort (as to increase overall max concentration even with lowered bioavailability) between 0.5 and 1 mg to start with and see how that treats me. I understand there's a fine line between a buzz and lengthy sickness with bupe as well as a danger to it as it has a stronger affinity than nalaxone in case of overdose.

Let me start off by saying I know for a fact they’re legit because I take the plug to to the pharmacy to pick up his script. However, there’s a few things that throw me off about them. 

First off, some imprints are upside down on the opposite side while others are normal, which I’m not sure if that’s a normal discrepancy or if that’s unusual. Also, when I put one in my mouth, the second it comes into contact, it immediately dissolved into a chalk like substance. No other pill has ever done this. On the other hand, the oxy high is fairly nice but I notice it wears off relatively quickly and I’m left with extreme thirst, dry mouth, and this lingering nausea. I understand these are common side effects but I’ve popped 30-40mg at once with other generic brands and don’t experience the side effects to this degree.

Today I have 7 months free from any street narcotics, and 5 months clean from the suboxone I used to taper with!

I'm generally feeling really good. I struggle with anxiety, trying to manage it with exercise, good diet, and meditation. I'm slowly re-learning self care and healthy coping mechanisms. I know I still have a long way to go, but I wanted to share my success with you guys today. 

Throughout my years of use, I somehow managed to just barely keep it hidden from my family, and was lucky enough to be able to get myself sober without a formal program  (although many times I thought about asking for help, I really probably should have)... so no one really knows still except this sub, of course.

Love you guys! Thanks for being here, I hope everyone is having a good day :)

I checked an equianalgesics chart, and it says Oxy is about 1.5X stronger than Morphine. It also says the oral BA of Oxy is about 87%, while Morphine is hovering around 25%. Obviously if I were to get some I'd have to increase my dose by about 1.5 to get the same effect, but would I also have to increase it further after that because of the different BAs? How do I calculate a dose? As a  simple example, if I normally take 10mg Oxy, I'd need 15mg Morphine. But if I were to eat those doses, I'd absorb almost 9mg of Oxy vs. only around 4mg of Morphine. So would that mean I need to take about 40mg of Morphine to equal a 10mg dose of Oxy? Also, I know there are plenty of other better ways of taking it that have higher BAs, but if I can't eat it I'm not interested, so I'm only concerned about the oral route.",1518906135.0

I was recommneded to try gabapentin by many people so for the reason for visit I said the vicoprofen isn't working and I need another medication thats stronger and the woman at the front said well you need to go to a pain clinic which is what the GP said and 
I'm in the process of finding one and also I need an MRI which is on friday for the pain clinics to even BEGIN to start prescribing medicine and explaining options and treatment. I am concerned that I'm asking for specific meds and I mean if she forgets I want to just say its not working and I need something stronger. the GP said we need to go into the controlled substances category since tramadol didn't work which was when I got the vicoprofen and MRI prescription on my second visit.

I was on opiates for about 7 years straight, mostly hydrocodone; then I got off of them and I've been using kratom for about 6-7 years now. I've tried a few opioid and opiates here and there but my dosages were always ridiculous and the experience lacking. I always thought that maybe it's because I didn't space enough time between the kratom but now I'm not sure. Last time I had an opiate was about 8 months ago, I got a bunch of free Vicodin, I waited until the next day to let the kratom get out of my system and I ended up taking all 12 that I had and barely got anything out of it, i feel like the acetaminophen had a stronger effect than the hydro did on me. A couple days ago I got half of a dilaudid, my friend regularly does only a quarter and he has similar experience with opioids as me, he said that a quarter is enough (for him) to get a good experience and a half is a strong dose for him. He suggested that I just try half for the first time just in case a quarter wasn't enough. I was really nervous, I've always drew the line at needles but things have been shitty and I've been hurting and I wanted to feel good for once.

Moments after I injected it I suddenly felt like I had been running for miles and my whole body got so heavy and relaxed, if I had been standing I think I would have collapsed. It was an amazing feeling, but it felt lacking, I didn't really get any euohoria, the whole experience seemed a lot lighter than what I was expecting and I kind of thought ""what's the big deal?"", it was nice but not nearly as great as what has always been described to me.

Anyways, I'm starting to wonder if something has changed with my body, even at the top of my opiate addiction I could still feel a few pain pills, I had a pretty high tolerance but if I took 12 Vicodin back then I would have definitely felt them. Could it be kratom that is causing this? The past few times I tried any other opioids I waited at least 12 hours but they didn't really work. The only ones that have worked were synthetic ones like suboxone, u-447700, and o-desmethyltramadol; but my dosages for all of those were very high except for the suboxone but it was still like double what I used to need and half the experience it used to be.

Idk if I just have a massive tolerance now or kratom is always lingering in my system and having an affect ",1519058439.0

I hope some of you Can give me some insight on this. We’re both what most people Call heavy drug users. We had had a ton of xanax, oxy, morfine and lyrica. Having fun all Night making Music, being barred out stealing snacks at 7-11 n so on.

I dont know What an OD looks like from personal experience so i Will describe the events and hope you Can Tell me What these Signs mean. And help me learn.

We had been somewhere, and decided to leave, at this point he doesnt walk very Well, and was nodding already. we get to his apt, smoke half a joint and he passes out. my friend is impossible to Wake up for more than 4 seconds. He fell asleep with food in his mouth which i had to dig out of his mouth, and i really had to get in there digging untill i couldnt find any more so he could breathe. He wouldnt go to bed but kept falling out of his chair. I tried to force him to come stay with me so i could keep an Eye on him, but he was impossible to get through to. He ended up falling over the couch laying in some fucked Way. At this point i had been trying to leave for an hour, and everyone except me n my gf had left, but i couldnt leave my friend like this. Thats when i lost contact with him, i could slap him, touch his eyeball, whatever. Nothing Woke him up. If my gf wasnt Holding his left side he would have fallen to the Ground. So we wrapped him in Towels barber style with the head sticking out at the top because i was gonna throw a bucket of cold water in his face. In our group of friends we would do this as a joke when anybody fell asleep, but it was more like a glass of water, and he hated it so much. So i knew he would absolutely hate the bucket of water. therefore wrapping him in towels so he didnt get wet. He Woke up mad as hell About the water. Thank god. 
He was kinda mobile, but still falling over all the time. And konstantly close to falling asleep. I made his bed and put a bottle of water by his bedside and watched him sleep to check his breathing. I went home 15 minutes later and called him first thing this morning and Hes fine.

Btw, i live in a place where to get narcan/naloxone you need to Take a Fuckin course that Costs more than most of the people who need it Can afford, and after the fucking expensive course the narcan/naloxone still Costs money.

I am a life long opiate lover/user. For the last 3 years I have been pumping H. Started with ECP and then my plug got a Tar connect. We took over the whole damn city. I was pumping a half oz or more everyday not to mention smoking 2 G’s to the head everyday. I even hired my home boy to run shit. Eventually I just sat back did my dope and collected money. 

About 4-5 months ago my plug straight dries up on the tar. He hands me a Quake of some shit powder H. I could not do enough of this powder to feel better. He was my only plug at the time so I didn’t know wtf to do. One of my buddies/ old customers had switched to Fent dope. Literally this was the only thing in town that would touch us and the mf selling the shit was knocking us over the head with the price. We couldn’t keep the money right. We was paying too much, and doing too much and had little other choice. Eventually the money dried up. Our favors ran out and we went down through there. 

Remember I said I was smoking 2 gs of tar... I turned to that mfing needle... I was not feeling better from snorting the little bit I was allotted that day. If you had asked me at any point up until I did it if I ever would and you would have gotten a loud resounding FUCK NO! Well I lied. I now know how it happens. Maybe easier for some but it was the hardest thing I ever argued with myself about. The plug never called us back even though we’d call him several times each and everyday. 

We had become unable to maintain our jobs. We had little to no guarantee of feeling well in the morning and so then spent the day finding a way to get it. I developed depression and anxiety. I went from the highest highs all the way down to the lowest lows. Without jobs our bills weren’t paid. So landlords want money. Fighting to keep water and electric on. 

Had so much riff raff running through my house I was being stolen from on a Daly basis. While I was in my stupor my woman who had been by my side riding and grinding for 5 years had taken over handling the operations. I had created a monster. She had never sold touched or even seen dope before me. 
I been hustling and getting high since 13 and I am now 29. This girl can hustle her ass off. So I just sat back and let her do her thing. She liked the feeling of being the big shot. 

Ultimately though I was boss and nothing happens without my approval... until we get hooked up with a new plug. He doesn’t really deal with white dudes like that but he’ll deal with females. He kept it professional and all that. All good except for now she had all the control, all the power. Her head swole up so big nobody could tell her nothing. She fucks the whole game up. Starts moving small weight to the 20 bag consumers. Making very little profit. Nobody wants to buy it any other way now. Now all the while we still wasn’t making enough money or staying with enough dope to make sure we were good everyday when we woke up but why. Because she’s got it all on lock down and she’s doing way more than anyone should or can and stay afloat. 

We get evicted from our nice 3 bedroom 2 bathroom house. While we should have been packing on those days leading to that day. She takes off and doesn’t come back for 2 days. She has my Tahoe. Which is our only vehicle at this point. She has the phone. She has all the money, and she has all the dope. She had left me to die. After 2 days she comes home. And tries telling me she was at her girl-friends house. Bull fuckin shit! Gives me a .1 and tries to dip out in my truck again. Uh-uh ain’t happening! We can both go. Nope she refuses. Some lame excuse about how she doesn’t want to leave the house empty cause of the landlords... smh gold bless her she’s an idiot. 

So while I’m not paying attention she has a ride pull up and she runs to the car. Once again gone with the phone. I have my phone that hasn’t been paid but I can call if I get on the internet. 

I go to her friends house and her friends car is there. When asked where she’s at she replies in the next town getting some jank. With who? Cause she was with this girl... oh her girls boyfriend had drove... yeah fuckin right! 

When I told her where I was shortly after the girl who is supposedly with her comes into the lit garage and turns the light off. Huh! Y’all are so stupid! Clearly we know what’s going on here. 

So I end up back at the house starting to deteriorate once again balling about her cheating ass while my sweet dog licks away my tears and tries to make me laugh. Just a man broken and a mans best friend. 

Once again was two days before she returned to the house. Swears up and down I’m tripping and she was doing exactly what she said. I’m not stupid.  But she is. She sat the phone down on the couch and had walked away. Hadn’t deleted her texts yet. She has been cuddled up with a friend of mine.... 

I kick open the bathroom door and started into this. Now behind me walks this big ball having ass home boy of mine. Gotta have big ones cause your disrespectful ass is brave to be in my mfing house right now. I tried to get him but was grabbed and wrapped up by this woman and others. I think I would have prolly killed his ass. Prolly lucky someone had stolen my hair trigger 1911 .45 not long before. 

If I hadn’t known the guy my beef would have been with her not him. My beef was with him tho because I not only knew him but used to be tight with him.   
I have now officially lost my entire life. 
I struggled to find a reason to want to live. So we pack the house on separate days and get out and split not saying another word. 
One day I Went to her to buy some dope cause my guy wouldn’t answer. She robs me. WOW! I don’t believe I deserved that one.  Ok whatever Start over let it go.. ok now a week goes by I’m back good but again my guy doesn’t answer. 
I’ll be god damned if she didn’t get me again. 

She has since called my parents to tell them about my dealings and has called my plug to try and get me cut off. He calls me and says I just heard this and that and I already knew who was behind this. I said bro she is on some next level type bullshit right now. He said if you was anyone else I’d have changed my number and cut you off but because it was you I had to call and see what was going on. That right there is mad love and I couldn’t be more greatful. 
Now today... sitting at a buddies house and she is calling his phone lookin for something. I hide in the closet and we let her in.  She starts talkin about how she called my dude and got me cut off and she’s going out there tonight. I’m just laughing now because oh how is she wrong. She walks back outside and I come out lock the bedroom door and gather my things. She comes back to the door and so I put my bag on my shoulder, I unlock the door and I step out into the hall. She must have jumped 10 ft back and had a look on her face like she seen a ghost. Jaw Dropped. I said “good luck going tonight” and I walked out the house and down the street. 
I called my dude and he’s like she’s tripping she ain’t coming here. Lmao. 
Then I get introduced to a new plug today for much cheaper. I’m like holy shit are good things actually happening to me. Oh btw i skipped over the part about how she came and stole my dog, and that my truck now has no plates because my insurance lapsed. 
Now here I sit in my truck. Parked outside of a hotel I paid to stay in last night but don’t have money for today. Freezing cold can’t go nowhere and got nowhere to go. I got a little jank and a little H. But nowhere to belong. I’m sick and I’m tired and I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired and also hungry. How the fuck did it all happen so fast? What the hell do I do now? I can’t go on like this much longer. 
I’m not sure why I wanted to share this story. Really I couldn’t possibly have told you every fucked up thing that has happened in this time period, but you got a good idea. 
I think maybe I’m struggling to find an end to the story or maybe a moral? 
It could be that I’m lonely sitting in this cold ass truck alone.

No one has ever done to me the things you did to me."" Snippet from my coke addled escapades living in a Peruvian ghetto.","Sarah was short, dark and pretty.  We met at the locutorio she ran, where I made cheap phone calls, foreign and domestic.  The clerk at Hostel Dax liked her, too.  One night I saw her at the hostel, but she wasn’t there to see me.

She and her manager at the locutorio let me make phone calls and pay them later.  Someone had been stabbed to death right there, where she worked.  No good reason for it, but the person died on the floor choking in a puddle of his own blood.  Sarah's manager saw the whole thing.  It had only been a few months.

There were a couple of computers, where I checked my email.  A girl I met in another city sent me two or three a week.  They always started the same, “Dear Gringo, you are a savage.  No one has ever done to me the things you did to me.  When are you coming back, so I can see you?” She never got a response.  I made long-distance phone calls to my family asking for money.  The money always came.

""I don’t know how long I'm going to make it, Mama,""

""What do you mean, Riley?""

""I think I'm going to die soon.  Something bad is going to happen.  I know it.""

There was a pause on the line.  Her voice was shaky but tried to reassure me.  ""Why would you think that?  Nothing is going to happen, Riley.  It's going to be fine.  There is nothing to worry about.""  She must have known I was getting high with phone calls like that.  It was before I started shooting up again.

""Someone is going to kill me.  I'm sorry, Mama.  I'm going to die.  I love you.""  I hung up.

It is caused by Suboxone, i am sure i can lower it, and if by the grace of god i can get prescribed ANY opiate, I want to know how to approach the subject with the doctor. 

For those of you who do not know, i am a ""veteran"" suboxone user. I have been taking it for over 10 years. 8-9 years straight. I was the first person out of anyone i knew, in my area, to use Suboxone. 

Its worked for its purpose, but i am facing a very long uphill battle with pain, and suboxone really isnt good for this (EDIT: NOT WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN ON IT FOR 13 YEARS) on a daily basis. It lacks the pain killing efficacy profile of other opiates . It definitely ""helps"" but the medicines that i use to actually treat pain are causing more side effects. medicines like meloxicam, flexirl, soma, robaxin, and many more. i have even tried other non-narcotic pain relievers. there are a few i have not tried, i will admit that. but that is becomng madness .

The withdrawals from Suboxone itself are horrendous, but it tends to always give me the same feeling on a daily basis. the only downside is that it lacks signifigant painkilling effects even when doseage is increased. 


that being said, i get high as shit off of suboxone.

but i do have a tolerance; subs mechanism of action seems to somehow not effect tolerance when taken at a low dose.



my tolerance should be around 20mg of oxy or hydrocodone two times per day (lets say LESS THAN 40mg a day) if i am being absolutely realistic interms of equivalent doseages.

i am sure icould last with less, but i am in the worst pain i have ever had in my entire life and i do not know how to explain everything to my doctor
this is partially due to my jaw being fucked up. its almost at the point in which i can no longer talk without severe pain so i have severe anxiety about going to the doctor, and wasting time. car rides make me vomit due to the pain. 


I plan to see a Neurologist first, because i have only seen my Primary 1 time. This is because my original primary who retired, would write refferals without seeing me; which i got used to, he was a very nice doc. He retired at the right time.


----------------------------
*TLDR*
I really need all the tips i can get. I have never pursued the 'legal opiates' route before outside of suboxone and when i have had surgeries (and subsequent ER visits for non-healing things that also got me opiates),as well as a few times being sick. feel free to write here or pm me.

i do live in a state with prescription monitoring. 


i am also prescribed klonopin, which i do wish to stay on. tonight; i used marijuana distillate with diclofenac , robaxin, suboxone, tylenol and klonopin to bring down the swelling in my ear and neck (which stems from my jaw) that i have had all day and i am now feeling good enough to write this message

Let me lay this out for you. 

I was hangin out at Bud's place for a few days (he's doing great btw) and at one point this girl, we'll call her CumDumpster. Another Homie shows up. Over the course of these 3 days I left a few times a day for a few hours at a time to do take care of other situations and get into trouble. Did 1 shot of meth when I woke up after the first night, and that was it. Bud, Other Homie and CumDumpster smoke meth continuously throughout. I go on one of my side trips and I thought I would end up with cash, instead I come back with a bunch of heroin. I don't ever want to have that shit in my body again so I give some to the three of them and go sell the rest while they roll along. Important to note, when we were getting in the car CumDumpster is insisting on taking shotgun and handling the deals. Bud suggests she sit in the back with him because you never know what can go wrong until it's happening, and it's Cujuabled's job to handle the deals. She flips shit accusing him of treating her like an asshole and being mean. We sell heroin and dropped Homie off on the way back. CumDumpster is... having fun. She's  flailing her everything around, she'll bonk herself on the head before tilting it and letting out an, ""Eeee!"" Then she'll turn to me and say, ""Oh hahahaha, when my body makes that sound it means I need to go to bed."" Constantly making strange noises and gestures I began to get concerned. She drinks like 2 four lokos when we get back to Buds. 

I wake up to her screaming at Bud, again accusing him of treating her like shit. Bud runs to me and says, ""I don't know what the fuck I did, but she's yelling and my roommate said he's about to kick me out early so I don't have the extra week, and CumDumpster gives zero fucks, bro. Please help me get her ass out."" Well god damn it good morning guys. Pack CumDumpsters shit, get her in my car, Bud walks up to my window, hands me ten dollars and says, ""get her home safe please,"" Yap on it. We hit the road and I realize she's now smoked off her fucking face. She's gone. That bitch is somewhere else. She's rolling around in the passenger seat saying things to me that seemed to be pulled from the middle of a conversation that never began, was never initiated. I hand her a cigarette and she thinks it's a shot. She begs me to take her tanning real quick, keeps trying to have me drop her at random houses, passes out mid sentence and comes back in a perceived situation that isn't actually happening. I get her home and walk her inside, when I'm leaving she grabs me in the doorway and slams me with this fat ass kiss that has a bonus tongue down my throat. I roll with it for like 7 seconds before I remember Bud is low-key in love with her and I'm sure she pretty much lives on a dick, so I leave after she lays down on the couch and knocks out instantly. Finally. 

This is where my dilemma begins. Later in the night she keeps calling me, so I keep ignoring her. She sends a text claiming she's at Burger King in a part of the county that's the sticks. This place is literally one main road, small shops along it and surrounded by woods, some of my worst memories happened out there and I avoid it at all costs, everyone out there is fuckin bonkers. She's at BK and claims no one wants to hang with her so I should. Huh. Well I wonder why in the ass gaping fuck no one would wanna hang out with her in such a state. Also bitch isn't it your bed time? I decide fuck it, I have a little over an hour until I can pull off this next move and unpredictable is far from boring, so I make it to BK. I immediately inform her of my timeline, after about an hour I have to leave without you. I'll kick it until then but get something in line for when that time comes.

She does no such thing. Instead she takes Snapchat videos while smoked off her face making no sense, throws fuckin chicken nuggets covered in bbq sauce in my car, and promptly knocks the fuck out in the passenger seat. I wake her up, ""CumDumpster, look man, you have 30 more minutes, please get on your phone and find someone to come here because I don't want to leave you in the cold. Especially out here, after midnight at that."" 

She kicks at my face, ""Go away!""

""Dude you're in my car. I don't have to be here right now but I am. Get on your fuckin phone and don't act like a kindergartener please."" She remains silent in a sleeping position. She lives about an hour away so I don't have time to take her home. More time passes, more attempts at getting her to cooperate shot down.

""Look CumDumpster, I don't know what you thought was going to happen here when you made nest in my car, because when I draw my boundaries I stick to them. Safety net for you or not, I'm getting you out of this car in 5 minutes and leaving. You're not leaving me another option."" She starts crying saying why does everyone treat her like this. I answer. ""Maybe it's because you're insanely co-dependant, hold this unrealistic expectation of everyone to spend their resources, time and energy sorting you out because you refuse to do anything yourself?"" She says she loves me. Great. Get out. I help her pack her things and walk her to a bench. She starts apologizing for putting me in this position and for being so uncooperative, and I tell her it's fine and I care about her, I just hope she learns from it, because I don't operate with that type of thing. She makes some calls, 2 people told her to fuck off I'm done with your shit, 1 guy said he'd be there shortly but he needs some time. We have a long hug, I give her a knife and a cigarette and say good luck. 

I get in my car and then this thing happens I don't think I'll ever forget, I can't pinpoint why, it just stuck out so much in this situation. As I'm pulling away she says to me, ""Hey, your name is Sweetheart in my phone,"" and gives a melting smile with a genuine glow in her eyes, they're this light shade of smooth, steely blue. Like bitch I'm leaving you in the cold after midnight in an area where you can only hope the crews that run around at night kill you and don't just leave you wishing they did. Her phone was on 3% when I left. 

So am I a piece of human trash? I drew my boundary, gave her plenty of time and warning to figure something out, and she fought every step of the way. She knew what would happen. She chose to let that happen instead of find an alternative. She made that decision. The few people in my immediate I've laid this out to say I'm horrible, but I feel like with so many chances to keep it from happening and her refusing to take them, it's on her. I called many times but didn't hear from her for about 36 hours, she called an hour ago and she's fine. But still, am I horrible?",1518998569.0

I can try and pretend Everything is so perfect underneath a blanket of opiates. I fucking hate myself and I hate who I’ve become. My personality hasn’t changed too much. But I definitely have stopped giving a damn about myself. 

Sometimes I go back and rewind in my memory......when I first started playing with Fire. When I was naive and oh so vulnerable.....if I could go back and tell my younger self to wake the fuck up and stop I would. I would slap and shake myself and show the younger me what my life will become. 

The worst part is....I’ve gotten clean before. I’ve been to rehab and halfway houses. I’ve flown to Hawaii and gotten clean in paradise. But I always end up back using. Idk what’s wrong with me. Why do I keep letting down everyone who loves me over a feeling? Maybe I just haven’t been in the dope game long enough....but I’ve died and been arrested already.....idk what it’ll do to get me to stop. 

I feel so fucking helpless and desperate right now. I’ve never cried while saying out loud “I don’t wanna do this dope” before. Until today. I’ve ignored my dad and best friend for months. My dad sends me texts every week with emojis and pleading to talk to me. I texted him back for the first time today apologizing telling him I love him and I’m in a dark place. And what he said has had me crying since he sent it. I texted my best friend who lives in Maui back. Told her I apologize. She said she knows how I get but she thought something bad happened. She’s flying here for my birthday in April and can’t wait to see me. I hate heroin but I can’t stop doing it. I hope one day I can get clean.

It was the grievous poison of the thing I chased hardest and hated most. I sat on the step into the bathroom and smeared the droplets of dark blood down my arm. Perspiration formed on my temples and along my uncombed hairline while the caustic fumes of chemicals floated hot out of my throat. A stampede of antelope ran through my head, and my eyes shook. My jaw tried to unhinge itself but settled to cock itself sideways and hung crooked off my face.

I stood up. Greasy cargo pants hung raggedy off my skinny waist. A dingy shoestring pulled two of my belt loops together. Panic stricken, I stood in the middle of the room with odd posture, one shoulder slightly stooped, and swayed. There were six more grams on the bathroom floor. I swallowed them, six bindles wax paper and all.

The shot of cocaine opened an invisible portal in my room that night, and the screeching whistle in my ears turned into weeping and wailing moans of tortured souls. Dark voices breathed out murderous threats against me from the other side of the abyss. Or maybe the voices were coming from the other side of the chain-locked door. I couldn’t tell anymore.

I jerked to the wall where the light switch was. The voices morphed into intelligible banter between cops over hand radios about me and what I was doing as they planned their raid. My hands fumbled at the switch. The lights went out.

In the dark, demons crawled through the portal and into my head, through my nose, eyes and ears. There was an urge to puke. My heart beat too hard, like it was going to explode, like always. The shadows of feet stepped back and forth in the crack of light under the door. Pablo was in the room with me, and he had come to finish the job. His hand touched my arm.

I turned the lights on. My mattress, bed frame, the dresser and night stand barricaded the door. It was supposed to help me relax while I was high, but now I pulled the furniture off the wall and walked out of the hotel onto the street.

I found Leticia, at work. 

“I can’t close the store yet Riley. It’s too early, but if it is slow, like it is now, I can close early. I’ll take you to a sober house. Don’t worry.” Her face focused on me. She had fallen in love and wanted me to get help, but the shine of cocaine evil in my eyes put her off. We had never talked while I was that high.

So I found a new dealer recently, like two weeks ago. First few transactions were great. Then he wanted to borrow $ and always needed the $ before he went to his guy. So he's not actually a dealer, he's a middle man. Friday I dropped off $ to him at work and he was supposed to bring me the stuff later, and then he somehow lost it. So he owed me two, and then I had to buy another one on Sunday because he didn't have any money to re-up. So now he owes me $300 and is not answering at all, he ghosted me. 

So, I have met him at his work and his house so I know where he works and exactly where he live, I have texted in few times saying just give me my money back even if you don't have it all at once you can give it to me in installments, still no response. I'm about to send a text that says if you don't respond to me as to when you will give me my $ back then I have no choice but to come to your work. Should I send that text?

I honestly don't know why; I've got weed, my life is getting back on track and I'm the happiest I've been in a long time.. But the urge is there. It would take me all of 30 minutes to go for a cycle, score, and be back here smoking it. But deep down, I know it's a terrible idea and I know I don't genuinely want to do it.

How do I get the thought of scoring out of my head? Is it a bad sign that the first opportunity I've had to score, I'm seriously considering doing it? I know someone on here must understand where I'm coming from. Thanks for reading, any advice is welcome",1519141785.0

I've had opiates before but they never really did anything for me, and I didn't really care about them. This time I found that when I take one, I get a nice, calm, centering high. I just feel relaxed, and kind of normal. Like the sort of static-y rough edges get smoothed out. It's nice, and so far I don't feel as if I need to do it all the time, and I also had some stressful stuff happen to me lately and it didn't make me want to run to the Norco either.

I guess what I'm trying to get at here, is is it possible to use opiates without being an addict? Is it possible to be an occasional user?

I don't want to become an addict, and I'm very aware of how many people have said ""I never expected it to happen to me"", but at the same time it's the first time I've found something that I can do to feel relaxed, the same way that people describe weed, or alcohol - drugs that do nothing for me. I'm no stranger to drugs either, I've done many, but I've never really enjoyed any of them all that much. They're either too much, or the side effects / come down are god awful.

Anyway, does anyone else get rebound anxiety when using?

However, this weekend, my anxiety has been increased 10 fold. Not when I am high, but when I wake up the next morning, and for the rest of the day, I can just feel myself on edge and very anxious. 


Does this happen to anyone else? I love opiates, but this was one of the main reasons I stopped my constant use. I'm kind of mad at myself I copped this weekend, but hell, I may as well finish what I have left or else it's just gonna be like flushing money down the toilet.

I recently went away for a few weeks to visit family and old friends, and despite my opiate use my life just seemed really great and I just felt really dynamic and confident after that.  So I came home and updated my Tinder profile.. and it worked!

because i am on suboxone i guarantee no doctor is going to fucking help me UNTIL i actually need surgery. how fucked up is that? why do i have to go under a knife in order to obtain something to kill my pain?

ive tried over 20 different medications that dont work for my pain

now my parents have made me so afraid of going to see the doctor , by giving me feelings that he wont help me because i am on suboxone . 


i went on suboxone b.c. of my pain, and the fact i was pretty young and didnt want to really go through the process of obtaining opiates via  neurologist . 

it worked well for years

but now even when raising the doseage i feel no pain relief whatsoever and my pain is so bad i can no longer talk.


contemplating suicide to have them admit me to the ER to have my pain treated. as they most likely wont admit me any other way. 

would like a social worker but idk if i can afford it
need help

and its not even due to lack of opiates, i actually have several different opiates, but i dont want to play around with shit like that. i need a doctor to actually help me. i do have an appointment, but like i said im scared of going because i have no support. what is the point of going to just come home and be in more pain and repeat the same routine that ive been doing?

my mother and father are pieces of shit that would rather me be in pain , than have a prescription to something that may help. my parents are pieces of shit. suboxone helped me and screwed up my life at the same time, but thats mainly my parents fault. 

I was never really addicted to opiates. Suboxone was meant as a replacement to vicoden and oxy, not to keep me off opiates. though now my parents are using it in that method when i have not touched another opiate in 13 years even though i have tons of them . 

So IG my plan is to quit suboxone and start taking dihydrocodeine for a while until i can get treated and my suboxone from the prescription monitoring falls off the chart in 6 months. I do believe that i have 6 months of codeien and dihydrocodeine. so it should work out.





*should i visit neurologist now or wait 6 months until suboxone falls off prescription monitoring chart?*

*will he actually help me while i am on suboxone?*
(ive taken so many meds, i will most likely have ulcers soon. i dont want another 100mg of diclofenac and somas. that shit doesnt do a lick of shit really for the pain i am experiences. it takes me 2 soma or robaxin, 2 tylenol, 2 diclofenac 100mg , 0.25mg of klonopin, 4mg suboxone and distillate just to bring the swelling down. 

and i am taking that every day for  over 4 yrs

so i guess my parents would rather me have a hole in my stomach, than allow me , someone whos almost 30, to have an opiate in their household. 

Meanwhile, Suboxone is like 10x stronger than morphine, with worse withdrawal effects, and doesnt kill pain nearly as well.

Thank y’all for your help in my previous posts. 
It made me a lot more confident, but unfortunately the stuff I got SUCKED! I still have one bag left from last night. It tasted chemicaly but didn’t do shit. Plus it had white chunks it in. 
So I found out that some random guy I met the other night is actually my dboys dad but everyone calls him unk. He’s super fucking cracked/methed out, but he’s also super cool. 
I went back to Unks house to get some blues instead but Unk was pissed. Started yelling and 7 guys ran out of the house ready lol. Unk is yelling about how little mike sold me some bullshit and how hes not going to get away with doing that shit from his house and how he’s selling some bullshit while he’s inside shooting the good shit. Lol. At this point so many people are yelling and walking back into the house that I only heard bits and pieces. I guess I’m not the only one he sold bs to. When Unk came back with my blues he promised me a g to make it up to me. He also gave me $4 and told me to give it to my daughter and tell her it’s from papa (which is what she called my dad who passed 4 years ago.) so I think I’m going to take it as a sign from my dad to stay away from this shit. 
So it sucked but at the same time it’s probably for the best. I think I’m just gunna have him give me some blues instead. ",1519096472.0

I felt pretty okay, but I had a paper and a midterm today, and as we all know, trying to find the motivation to work/study when in any type of withdrawal is miserable. I have ADHD and take Concerta for it, and I took 5 times my regular dose last night to get the motivation/focus to study. Naturally  I got a grand total of 90 minutes of sleep MAYBE.

However, my paper turned out well, and I aced my International Finance midterm. After my last class I made the 2 1/2 hour drive back home to cop a g and a couple more subs. I snorted some of It, but I only just now got back into my house and did a fat shot. 

I feel fantastic, partly cuz of the dope, and partly because the past 6 days is the longest I've gone without shooting dope in over a year. I almost always end up cracking on day 3 or 4, So it's nice just to know that I CAN go that long without shooting dope. And what's more, that I can manage to be somewhat productive if necessary. Last semester I was spending 3k a month on dope, and driving 160 miles back home to cop like every 2 days. Now I am actually feeling like dope isn't worth the inconvenience. Idk if I'll use over Spring Break, which starts the 2nd of March, but I know I'm not going to until then.

7yskv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7yskv7/what_is_wrong_with_me_opiates_cured_anxiety/,14,https://redd.it/7yskv7,marstars85,What is wrong with me (Opiates cured Anxiety)," I'm writing this in hope that someone will read it and help me. I know its long but I really need opinions and I cant take it anymore. I'm not one to beg but I just need some more knowledge on what I should do about this or what is even going on.

I'll start from the beginning. My crippling anxiety/social anxiety started in Late Middle School as a young teen. (I'm now 20) I would only get anxiety in random situations, and over the years up to late high school it progressed and got worse to full on anxiety all day everyday. The anxiety I feel/felt is purely physical, my body would be freaking out but in my mind I knew/know everything is completely fine.

This made me isolated, and couldn't keep friends because I couldn't go out or do anything without having panic attacks or feeling like I was going to die. It honestly felt like my body was holding me back from who I truly was. I had many doctors and psychiatrist appointments and tried almost every SSRI, SNRI. None helped they either made it worse or gave me horrible side effects.

This continued up until my senior year of Highschool when I tried an Opioid, Oxycodone. I already know people are going to say ""Well yea of course you feel better you took a opioid"" But it wasn't that. When I first took it was almost like something clicked. I felt More compelled to go out and talk and to make more conversation, I actually wanted to go out and do things. I was more active and had no body anxiety and felt the closest thing to ""normal"" that I had in years. I called up friends I haven't talked to in months and talked to them for hours which never happened. Obviously when you have been tortured by anxiety for almost your full life you want to continue feeling normal so I continued to take Oxycodone. And My life absolutely changed for the better.

1) I was actually able to get a full time job and hold it down.
2) My first time in my life I was able to have a relationship.
3) I was happy and anxiety free and was able to be myself and my best.
4) I actually would be out with friends more than I would be home.

*But the thing that really is important and weird to me is I wouldn't need to take it everyday to keep these effects. I would really only take it maybe twice a week sometimes I wouldn't take it for a week or 2. But seemed as long as I took it at least once every other week I was fine. Which makes no sense to me because Its not like I was high on a drug all the time it was almost like gas for a car like I would do it one day and be good for awhile which leads me to think it could be a chemical imbalance of some kind

Things were so good while I was in that regime that I 100% believed I had conquered my anxiety I felt like a changed person and things were great. And so I decided I wasn't going to take Opioids anymore. I just didn't want them to be apart of my life anymore So I stopped. And everything still was good I was still able to go out, my anxiety was non existent, and I felt fine this continued for a month and then I started to feel subtle hints of anxiety slowly returning. Only thing I can compare to is like running an engine with low oil (Oxycodone being the oil). It just slowly kept getting worse and worse until I broke down again.

Now its a year and a half later. I have lost my relationship because she said I'm not the same, I lost my job I hang out/talk with hardly no one. (I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad for me and don't want anyone to feel bad for me I just want to get across how drastically my life has changed) I still haven't touched any Opioids or any drugs because I been trying to naturally work on my anxiety but it seems no matter what I try or do its still there which leads me again believe it must be some sort of chemical imbalance or something that cant be naturally fixed.

I have been up countless nights staying up to 3am doing research looking for answers on what it could be the only things I could dig up is a possible Dopamine Deficiency ,Opioid Deficiency or an Over Active Fight or Flight Response.

My questions are:

What do you think is wrong with me? and why do you think taking Oxycodone every other day or every other week drastically helping me.

What could take to get back to where I was?  I thinking low dose Buprenorphine, A Long Acting Benzo, Or a Dopamine Agonist/Dopamine Promoter or a Stimulant.

I'm really at a cross road because I know Buprenorphine can lower testosterone and effect libido and sex in my life is important to me, A Benzo long term and wreck havoc on GABA receptors
And become virtually impossible to come off And a Dopamine Agonist/Dopamine Promoter can be dangerous and make things worse. But I just want my life back I want to be happy again.

Thank you for reading I would appreciate any and all responses.",1519094814.0

I’m not an opiate virgin but I’ve done some codeine and tramadol. Tramadol actually worked heavenly for me when I did it. I’d take a pill, then cut up and snort the other one. The rest of the day I’d sit in bed nodding off etc. 

I’m really ill today (food poisoning) and was thinking to get OTC co-codamol or something easy lol. Because of this, I started to read up on painkillers for fun, and tried to do some research on how to get tramadol. It looks pretty easy and cheap to get.

Then I went on here. Sounds like a path that I shouldn’t go down. Like, even though I haven’t done that much, I fantasise sometimes about finding a box of tramadol so I can spread out the pills and have some ready for when I feel like it. Not really sure what I mean here but I do imagine it.

Because I’ve felt how good it feels (I undoubtedly know my 2 tramadol pills doesn’t equate with stronger painkillers) I feel like I can sympathise a bit with you guys. It’s a fucking great feeling. If I could feel like that all the time without the negative consequences I would. But I hope whoever is having a bad time with opiates and wants to quit gets put on a good path.

I'm scared.","Right, so I've picked up some Tramadol out of curiousity and have used 200 and 250 mg respectively in the last two days. My only prior experience with opiates was with codeine. 

My issue is that I've been having these weird fits where my eyes just sort of start going out of focus and I have an urge to close them and kind of nod. After I open my eyes again I have to ""readjust"" them to see properly. It feels almost identical to when you're sleep deprived and start having microsleep episodes. This seems to happen only when I'm in a sitting position and trying to focus my vision on one object. For example I was on the metro and this kept happening every few minutes. 

I've googled this and I've started reading about absence seizures and Jeavons syndrome and now I'm fucking terrified. Is this actually what's happening, since tramadol can cause seizures? Or is it just the ""nodding"" of tramadol? As I've said, this feels almost identical to microsleep episodes, and I haven't slept much this week, but I wasn't really sleep deprived today as I've slept about 8 hours. 

Please share any advice or experience you have, because I'm getting paranoid about this. 

Edit: I should note that during this nodding phase I've also had something which I would almost classify as CEVs. For example I had a vision that a person was standing in front of me on the metro, and then I realised that my eyes were closed. ",1519085560.0

Well most of my life has been a dark time because of mental illness, but one year ago I discovered my personal rock bottom. (Albeit not as bad as most of the ""rock bottoms"" described here in this sub.) I had cervical cancer, uterine polyps, and endometriosis. I had a hysterectomy surgery (which wasn't the bad part) and my doc put me on Percocet. That's around the time I started lurking in this sub and flirting with the idea of trying H. Like I said I was in a dark place. 

A little background, I was born addicted to meth so I avoided drugs that weren't prescribed by a doctor. However, I was prescribed practically every psychiatric drug in existence, since I was just a kid. I was on Adderall for 20 years. Klonopin 8, Xanax 2, you get the picture. 

My fiancée's drinking problem had reached a climax and she started beating me. Eventually she would leave me for a married woman with kid, shortly following my surgery. Between the surgery and her departure, I was the victim of police brutality after I had a PTSD flashback. My doctor called the cops and they showed up in riot gear. I didn't even have pants or a bra on. It was just a real shit time for me. My PTSD was getting worse and worse, I was stuck in these memories that were eating me alive. I was screaming at myself to stop them, sometimes in public. I had to leave my dream job, (where I was actually making a difference in the world) because of many reasons, but mainly because I literally couldn't hold it together mentally. (Also a coworker touched me inappropriately.) I was suicidal and I thought to myself, 'fuck it, I may as well have some fun before I kill myself.' I started abusing my percs and potentiating it and lying to the doctor for it. It wasn't long before I was looking for it on the street. Anyway. I had been reading this sub for a while and someone wrote a post about doing H for the first time. You all were begging this person not to do it. Well, I heard you. I made a deal with myself. First try to get better, then if that doesn't work, kill yourself slowly with drugs, or fast. Whatever. Just one last ditch effort. 

My doctors, family and friends had been pushing me to do this outpatient rehab for mental illness for a while. I said I'd try the program. If it didn't work, who cares? I'd get some H, get high a few times then end it. 

 Well, I just graduated from that program on Feb 9th. I haven't had a pill since. I got help for my mental illnesses and I'm medicated (gabapentin and Baclofen.) Better yet, I'm back doing what I love (zoology) and I am working on getting published again, and making real contributions to the scientific community.

I had preloaded the rig and was going to enjoy myself in the bathroom when I had the great idea to rinse a couple of cottons and beef up that last shot. 

The way I usually do a cotton rinse is grab as many as I can (mine are usually quite small), stuff them into a syringe, pull water up in there, leave for a while,; then squirt into the target rig. When I'm squirting into the top of the target rig I lose my grip and next thing you know half of my shot is on the floor along with both rigs..

With little hesitation I dropped cottons on that toilet floor dope, sucked it up and banged that shit. It wasn't until a couple of days later did I realise I did such a fucked up thing... im not sick physically right now but this is an indicator of some serious mental sickness..",1519076981.0

7yq501,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7yq501/sleeping_on_opiates/,4,https://redd.it/7yq501,MJSsaywakeyourselfup,Sleeping on opiates,"Ok so I dabble every couple of weeks in opiates mainly weekend off, weekend on heroin #3 sniffed, weekend off, weekend on either heroin #3 sniffed or codeine. When I say a weekend it’s either 1 day or 2 days then I’m T total. Never used any more often. So I’m after some opinions. 

Is there a better opiate to sleep on? Whenever I take heroin I nod out and have crazy vivid dream for a min or two then wake back up. If it’s bed time I get a max 30-60 mins of sleep then wake up for a bit then sleep again. I enjoy it but the day after I feel groggy AF and I don’t take advantage of my free time which kind of sucks. I once mixed oxy with xanax and I would never do it again, I didn’t go hospital of anything but I feel it could of went sour very easily and I was naive

Thanks

As a woman who is no stranger to anal, it wasn’t that bad. Now I’m just laying here, on my stomach, waiting, contemplating my life choices, lol. It’s been about 15 minutes and I still don’t feel anything. When would it be safe to redose? I think I might redose orally. I usually take about 60mg orally and that takes away the pain as well as leaves me with a nice, warm, euphoric feeling. I know the BA is higher with boofing than anal, so I might take only one orally instead of two. ",1519073486.0
