My guy who will front me won't be up until at least 2 or 3pm. And my other main just told me on Sunday he doesn't do fronts ever anymore (he used to before I moved away and I just moved back after 3 years gone). But I gave him a call anyways, and guess what...

He immediately said yeah I got you on a LOOKOUT! Not even a front, a fucking lookout, free half g to get me through work today. I was so stoked. He told me the normal spot and I used my sisters uber to get there. As soon as I get there, he doesn't answer and then his phone is off. I'm so mad and sick I could have cried. After almost half an hour I accepted defeat and started to walk to my bosses house nearby. As I'm about to get out of his neighborhood I try him one last time and it rings, but no answer. I think he just was going back on it and no longer wanted to do it. 

Then I get a text: ""in da grass on (street name) between the green and grey mailboxes""

I'm thinking he's going to say it was there and he didn't know what happened to it. But I walk to the spot anyways and low and behold I find a bag, tied up in the grass. I grab it and look and I may not have my scale, but I know it was over a half gram. 

Thinking my luck couldn't get any better as I noticed its a new batch, a much lighter grey color, and I'm thinking he gave me a cut up bag, but oh well, if it gets me well I'll be happy. I am walking down the road opening the bag with my card out to take a bump and as soon as I open it, overwhelming smell of vinager. I take a bump. And another. And about 5 more, I think three up each nostril.

So yea it's nice and all, rush is bomb diggs, but one thing I've noticed both with fent and down and i dunno if I'm just weird it something but after the rush, I feel minimal high. Barely nodding every once in a while but when I snort it, I nod haaaard the euphoria lasts for at LEAST 20 minutes then I feel good for at LEAST an hour and stay well for up to 10 hours. Iv the rush lasts about a minute, the euphoria lasts about 10 minutes, then I feel good for about an hour, and stay well for about 4-6 hours. So the question is, if this isn't just me, why do people like IV so much? Seems like the dope goes way further snorting it. Usually .2 lasts all day, today I went through .4 and still need a bit more. Also, just minutes ago I wasted my first shot to coagulation, didn't realize it coagulates so fast, like damn. So that sucked. Another reason for snorting (or boofin if that's ur cup of d). Anyway, sorry for the huge post just figured I'd see what my favorite people have to say.

In some respects it‚Äôs hard to believe, but when I really stop to think about my fucked up trajectory I remember each second in agonizing detail.

I was thinking tonight about my relationship with opiates. For so long I had felt incomplete- forever searching for something I would never find. Discovering opiates was like complete rejuvenation. What I failed to acknowledge was that my newfound euphoria made my preexisting life look even shittier. When you feel like you‚Äôve found what you‚Äôve always needed, you‚Äôre blind to what‚Äôs transpiring behind the curtain. I was beyond smitten, ignorant to the fact that this synthesized state of mind fucking brainwashed me behind my back into believing my life without opiates was a waste of time.

It has taken me so long to reach a point mentally where I can recognize how warped my sense of reality became while using. In terms of, well pretty much everything, judgements made are typically garbage. But anyway, the point is that the idea of my life being meaningless without opiates has probably been the hardest part to recognize and work through.

I've been doing dope in this city (Northeast, ECP) for many years and I've never felt this way.

I have a hard time it's just an antihistamine cut, because I thought that those cuts were very common and I've never felt like this before. 

This effect is consistent and I don't notice a tolerance to it over the past 10 days or so that I've been getting these bags.

I don't notice a lot of cut building up in the spoon (IV), so I assume it cannot be a benzo since those aren't water soluble and they should end up stuck in the cotton or on the bottom of the spoon, and as I said, it doesn't seem to be an antihistamine because I should be used to those as a cut since they are supposedly common in ECP, and AFAIK it is heroin and not some weird research chem (the way it looks and smells and tastes and mixes up and feels [other than the extra sleepy feeling])...

The source of my misery is different but just because it started differently, it could easily end the same. 

Anyway, a few years ago I was hit, as a pedestrian, by a vehicle. I was surprisingly ""lucky"" as all I did was mangle a leg. It healed really well though and apart from a tiny limp sometimes, you'd have never known anything happened. 

Until about six months ago. I have had an ongoing infection since then. It's likely been festering for the past several years since the accident. Had some hardware removed from the leg a few months ago, but no help. It started getting REALLY bad in the past couple of weeks. I'm in the hospital now because it was so bad I couldn't even move it without using my arms to do so (like if I wanted to put my leg in a different position I'd have to grab it with my hands and move it). 

After some scans and tests and cultures it seems I have severe osteomyelitis (infection in the bone) and it is so severe that there aren't many options. Right now we are hitting it with the one antibiotic that may have a slim chance of helping. The other option is amputation. 

I'm so fucking depressed. I'm a single, divorced mom who will soon probably be missing a leg. I already have non""friends"" outside of my career. I've dodged a bunch of life threatening stuff in the past including a heart attach, cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, and endocarditis-- all of which could/should have killed me. The thought of losing a leg is worse. I feel like I will be completely unlovable and useless. My career will suffer if not end. I'll be a drag to be around for my kids, and an embarrassment to them. I don't think I've ever felt ""depressed"" like this before. But I'm just so alone and this sucks. Oh and I'm supposed to move in 2 days but I'm in the hospital and I also now have NO money so I'm basically about to be homeless. 

You're probably thinking I should just suck it up, at least I'm alive, at least I'm getting good meds in hospital, or whatever. But i just want to live normally and not die alone.

My life is still far from perfect and I know that there's always gonna be highs and lows.   But I've really learned to appreciate life without heroin. 

Oddly, I look back at my time as an addict in two ways.  First, fondly when I think of the joy opiates brought me. The relief of calming withdrawal, the excitement of scoring, the euphoria of using, the sight of blood in the barrel. 
For such a chaotic lifestyle, there appeared to be many good memories. 

Second, I feel disgust. For how selfish I became, for how I put substance above love both of myself and from others. For the lies. For the debts I am still paying. 

I don't regret my choices in life. I feel no shame in my past. I hope none of you feel shame for your use either current or past.

Just over a month ago after over 3 years of pretty consistent (mainly)oxy use with some clean time mixed in I rang that unringable bell when I was at my lowest and told my parents I had an addiction and I needed their help getting clean. They have been crazy supportive, helped me through WDs the first time, even put me up in their room to do it.

Being the addict that I am I wasn't totally honest on the length and intensity of my use for fear of disappointing them or just not being honest with myself, who the fuck knows, I lied anyways. 
So I went through withdrawals and afterwards when I was feeling better I needed to get out of the house, so I did and well you probably know where this is heading. 

Fast forward to about a week and half ago when I came home and fessed up about using again and my mom was cool about it. So more WDs, and then a few days when I'm feeling good I got to leave again. I went to my exs for the night and ate a few perks that night, nothing crazy. 

The next day (yesterday, also thanksgiving) we get into a huge fight and I took off from his place just an emotional fucking roller coaster of a mess. I mean I cried all day. I pulled over on the side of the road and cried for a few hours. I drove home, crying the whole way, and fucking cried some more when I pulled into the driveway and saw my dad. 

I am not kidding you, we went to turkey dinner at my great grandmas and I cried into my fucking stuffing and mashed potatoes. 

It was a rollercoaster of a day. Obviously the whole family got front row seats to this absolute shit show that is me, myself and I. So today I was feeling a lot better and wanted to get out of the house. I wasn't even thinking of using or anything, it's just that I haven't really stayed at my parents house for longer than a few days since high school and even then I was always a road runner. So I'm laying in my bed making plans to go see an old friend when my mom comes in and tells me that I'm not allowed to leave unaccompanied for a week. I know she is protecting me in this fragile state of being that I'm in and this is what I asked of her when I told my parents what was going on with me so don't get me wrong, I'm not mad or upset about it. I'm just kind of having a laugh at myself that I've been ""grounded"".

I struggle with manic depression and anxiety, like many of us do. The correlation between addiction and mental health is all too real. Does anyone else have problems just keeping their shit together in general when trying to get away from opis? I know I have to pay the piper but man oh man why does a leaf stuck to the bottom of my shoe set me off into waterworks? 

I'm just shooting the shit here, bored out of my ever loving mind, so feel free to comment or send a message. I'd love to talk with some of you guys who actually understand what addiction is like. ",1507692660.0

So I go to this place before work, with time to spare, and the receptionist says ""oh hey, yeah we only do needle exchanges at our other location."" Ok, fine, it's close-ish and more or less on my way to work. So I arrive at this other location in a really bad part of town. Google has their hours listed and says they're open. But the door is locked, and the windows have heavy black tint. On the window is a sticker saying the needle exchange is only open from like 7am to 9am, and from noon to 2pm. It's 2:55pm. I look in the tinted window and see a counter with a sign that says ""Harm Reduction"" with dozens of brown paper bags lined up, and two guys in scrubs shuffling around behind the counter. So I knock and they just kind of look at me and shrug at eachother. I knock again. Finally one comes to the door and says through the glass ""we're closed."" So I act like I can't hear him and he opens the door and says we're closed. I say ""I just need to exchange some syringes. Can you just grab me one of those bags real quick? I wasn't aware of your short hours."" And he's like ""no sorry, we're closed, come back tomorrow."" Like, really?!

75kyju,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/75kyju/nad_therapy/,4,https://redd.it/75kyju,themodsarebitches,NAD+ Therapy,"NAD+ Therapy is also know as resetting the brain. This concept is fairly experimental and is relatively new. It costs around 500$ per 'reset'. NAD+ therapy can supposedly increase your energy, focus, and metabolism, improve your cardiovascular health, and help you detox from alcohol and drugs. 

I wanted to share this article because I believe it could be incredibly beneficial to anyone here who is struggling with a addiction. Although I must clarify I have not tried it. Regardless it is very interesting and well worth the read.

This post originally appeared on¬†VICE UK.

""It's good to be skeptical about wonder drugs, because often there's nothing wonderful about them at all. So when a finance worker friend of mine told me he'd discovered a miracle treatment that gives him a huge advantage over his colleagues, I was dubious. ""No‚ÄîI'm full of energy every day and feel like a new person!"" he promised. ""I don't need to drink eight cups of coffee every day now; this is so much better, and I just get a top up every few weeks!""

I suspected he may have just found out about Modafinil, or one of the other study drugs internet psychonauts have already been using for years. But I was wrong. He sent me a link to a pharmacy in South Kensington offering intravenous ""Brain Reboot Infusions,"" which of course sound far too much like something from¬†Minority Report¬†to be genuinely real. But I decided to give my friend the benefit of the doubt and do a little research anyway.

The main ingredient in the intravenous cocktail is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or ""NAD+."" Discovered in 1906, it's a coenzyme found in all living cells that is ""essentially responsible for converting food energy into cellular energy,"" according to Dr. Mark Collins, consultant psychiatrist at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton.

The internet¬†tells me¬†NAD+ is popular among the ""anti-aging community,"" thanks to a Harvard Medical School study that found it rewound ""aspects of age-related demise in mice."" It's also supposedly good for: detoxing from alcohol and drugs, increasing energy and focus, reducing chronic fatigue, increasing your metabolism, and improving your cardiovascular health.

It still sounded like bullshit, but the only way I could tell for certain was to put it to the test. I'd quit drinking that particular week, and‚Äîas I'd learned online‚Äîthis treatment could apparently help to mitigate my booze cravings, so the timing was perfect: I booked an appointment for the following day.

Zen Healthcare, just around the corner from Harrods, specializes in the kind of things you might expect a Knightsbridge clinic to specialize in: ""bespoke weight loss therapies,"" travel vaccinations for far-flung locations, botox, ""vampire facials,"" and, of course, Brain Reboot Infusions‚Äîwhich will set you back about $600. (Full disclosure: I got mine for free.)

I arrived a little early, but a Dr. Yassine was there to meet me and explain some of the side effects I might experience while receiving the treatment.

""You will feel your chest tighten and may get a headache,"" he said. ""But this will pass.""

I signed some waivers and was escorted to a room where Yassine took my blood pressure. Which, you'll be happy to hear, was normal.

""Are you OK with needles?"" he asked.

""Yeah, fine.""

Yassine inserted the drip and, a moment later, the ""Brain Reboot Cocktail"" was flowing through my veins. As he'd warned, I began to feel my chest tighten. Thirty minutes in, I started to wonder what I was doing‚Äîmy head was aching, the discomfort was becoming kind of alarming, and I was suddenly acutely aware that a foreign substance had by now probably completely flooded my bloodstream. I toyed with the idea of hitting the buzzer Yassine had provided me with should I want to end the treatment, but I decided to stay the course.

Fifty minutes in, I felt a calm sense of positivity envelope my body. Yassine came in and said I had ten minutes left, which flew by. Removing the IV, he asked me how I felt.

""Kinda dreamy,"" I said.

""A lot of people say similar. Be careful on your way home.""

I thanked Yassine more than I needed to. It was time for me to go.

I walked outside, and it hit me: I felt a surge of energy, but no jitters or edginess. My mood had noticeably improved. I felt poised, positive, and pumped-up. I remember thinking,¬†This is awesome, and then saying exactly that out loud. I hopped on the subway, which was as crowded as ever, but for once all the back sweat and the fact it was nearly getting in my mouth didn't bum me out at all.

I woke up the next day at 7 AM and didn't feel horrendous, which is unusual for me. In fact, I felt great. The dreamy feeling had gone, but there was a definite improvement in energy levels, focus, and mindset. This continued throughout the rest of the day, and then for the following eight or so days. But what of its supposed effects on my otherwise unwavering love for beer?

""It's been known for decades that a high dose of vitamin B3‚Äîthe 'poor man's' way of elevating NAD levels‚Äîhas a beneficial effect for alcoholics, both in terms of detoxification and, perhaps more importantly, in reducing craving and anxiety levels after detoxification,"" said Dr. Mark Collins in an email.

And it seems the theory still holds: In all the time I could feel the treatment's effects, I didn't crave the cold embrace of a freshly poured pint even once.

That said, my cravings were just that: cravings. It's not like I was in the midst of a full-blown Stella dependence; I just like alcohol. So to find out how useful NAD+ therapy really is when it comes to drug or alcohol addictions, I asked Dr. Yassine to take me through the theory of how exactly a Brain Reboot Infusion can help someone suffering from withdrawal.

""NAD+ has a significant role in reducing the withdrawal effects by restoring the neurotransmitter balance, which shifts significantly after the drug that's been withdrawn has been removed,"" he explained. ""As a result, the patient experiences almost no withdrawal symptoms whilst and after completing the infusion cycle.""

Of course, Dr. Yassine works at a clinic that offers this procedure, so it would make sense for him to talk up NAD+. Still, Dr. Collins‚Äîwho specializes in addictions and has no real reason to sing the treatment's praises‚Äîis also complimentary, if a little cautiously. ""I have now witnessed its use in many patients and am very impressed with the short-term results,"" he said in his email, adding that ""what is clearly needed is more research, and in particular longer-term outcome studies.""

Dr. Yassine put me in touch with some patients, on the condition of anonymity, to hear how the treatment has worked out for them.

""I've been taking codeine for the last few months,"" said Jeff*. ""It started with a back pain, and I never realized I was going to be hooked up. Then I tried to stop, and it was hell. But having tried NAD+ infusions, stopping codeine has been easier; I didn't feel all the debilitating symptoms I'd experienced earlier.""

Ian*, who had been using crack and heroin, had a similar experience.

""I'd be lying if I said the thoughts [about picking up] aren't in my mind, and in my mind often, but that deep 'urge' that addicts will know about isn't there any longer,"" he said. ""I also see a therapist to talk through and figure out why I'm driven to such behaviors, but as of right now, I feel a sense of self-control that I've not felt in a long time. I still have more treatments to go, and I feel I'll always need therapy, but thank God I decided to tell some strangers my deepest problems. Things could have been very different.""

Ian's point is important: NAD+ therapy‚Äîwhile seemingly useful, according to everyone I spoke to‚Äîis not a panacea. While it may well dull cravings in some patients, it might not for others‚Äîand clearly it can't be relied upon exclusively without additional therapy and other forms of treatment.

For me, the treatment did exactly what it said it would, and there are promising signs that it helps with drug and alcohol withdrawal. But as for NAD+'s supposed anti-aging properties, or its ability to improve your metabolism and cardiovascular health, it's very early days. As Dr. Collins pointed out, much more research needs to be done before anything can be said for sure.

I am tired about the stigma that surrounds drug use, and I can't talk to friends about this, I can only voice myself here.

I first tried opiates a couple years ago, and I didn't quite like them. A few months ago, I got a decently sized stash of painkillers.

It's been a couple dull weeks, with little to do at college, without any active duties so I kind of ""went ham"" with the stuff - using it for two or three weeks once a week.

After my stash is gone, I am not going to purchase any because I am terribly afraid of addiction. I am honestly freaked out about the thought of getting withdrawals, and ruining my relationships. I am also someone who overthinks, and makes every problem of his a mountain. Is there something wrong with me?

I am quite new into this sub and I've lurked for a while, and I wanna know why you guys do opiates, in which circumstances and if you are addicted, what brought you into this situation

If you feel I am being intrusive with this question, you don't need to answer, and forgive me if I'm sounding paternalistic. I'm a fucking degenerate myself.

Bobby was there for all of it. When I stopped serving him he found someone else. And then someone else again.

His parents kicked him out Thursday of last week. He gets paid every Friday and cops 5 buns. He died Saturday morning with vomit in his mouth. I wish he stayed with me but I wasn't in NY.

TLDR; I have an older sister that's 24 and a heroin addict. What goes through her mind when sober?

She's had a heroin habit for ~3 years. She's been using pills since 16 or possibly younger. We put her through rehab about a year ago, but could only afford 90 days, immediately followed by a family vacation. She started using 2 days after we got home. Her housing is payed for and food is often provided. I sympathize for her and obviously want to help, but it's hard for me sometimes with how she acts, and my inability to really understand what that level of addiction can turn someone's mindset into.

My real question is, when she's sober, are there times when she's like ""fuck i really gotta do something about this and make some changes""? or does it sound like she'd be more interested in ""aint got shit else to do, let's party""? are some people perfectly happy being heroin addicts? or is it pretty much a shitty existence for anyone?

Now, to my harm reduction redditors, I appreciate the sentiment of keeping me and everyone else safe, but I do this for the sole purpose of potentiating the oxy.  To those that aren‚Äôt opioid tolerant **DONT DO THIS**.

Now, to the topic at hand. I was wondering if anyone ever noticed diminished effects when taking oxy and drinking a beer at the same time? And if mixing oxy and alcohol which is the best schedule to take them? Same time? Oxy 15 min before? Or beer 15 min before?

It just seems when I take them simultaneously I don‚Äôt feel the oxy until about 1hr after dropping, when usually I feel it about 30min in. Am I the only one? Is this all in my head? Or does anyone else notice these effects too.

Extra info that may be pertinent:
All taken on an empty stomach always to potentiate
Promethazine pills taken 30min before. 50mg
Oxy 25mg usually dosage is about 60mg

They searched my house for a number of hours and then charged me with being involved in a drug trafficking ring.

They allege I was an opiate-addicted errand boy and made very little money. They allege that I was not a leader or organiser of the ring and mainly just drove around picking things up and following orders.

However, because of the scale of alleged traficking my lawyer told me I should expect to get a head sentance of about 8-10 years in prison and do 3-5 years before i'm elligable for parole. I have no criminal record and have never spent time in prison. I will be locked up in about 8-12 months depending on how fast the case progresses as the court system in my country is slow.

I have a young son who is 2 years old and a girlfriend I have dated for 7 years. Since the police left she has been screaming at me every day about how much she hates me for the situation i've created.

The police restrained all my finances including all my savings accounts and my house. My lawyer believes they will try and seize this off me. My car and all my other assets I had to sell to pay for my lawyer. So now i'm basically completely broke.

I am also towards the end of a university degree which I have studied for the last 5 years, my final exams are in a little under a month. After I get out of jail it is unlikely I will ever find work in my field with a criminal record involving drugs.

Today after I was leaving a meeting with my lawyer my girlfriend came and met me in the city, saying we needed to talk. Our son was being looked after by her mother at the time.

When she arrived she was drunk and I knew something was wrong so I immediately asked her what was up. She confessed that because we were broke she had organised a date with a guy through SeekingArrangement.com and met up with him in the city. She said he paid her $400 but they didn't do anything sexual. I told her if this is true then show me all the messages you exchanged with him (and other guys) on the site. She flat out refused.

I told her that I felt like she had cheated on me and the money part of it was irrelevent to me. She exploded in rage, screaming at me in front of our son about how much she hates me and what a disgusting human being I am for getting involved with drugs.

This evening she left, taking my son with her. She told me I would never see her or my son again and he wouldn't visit me even once when i'm in jail. She hopes that I spend as much time in jail as possible and that she's glad to be rid of me.

So now i'm completely broke, about to do a long stretch of time in prison, and have wasted the last 5 years of my life studying hard for a degree which is now useless. I may never see my son again and the only long term relationship i've ever had is over. I've lost my house and my car.

If I could feel sorry for myself and blame the world it would be easier, but I can't. I know that the blame lies entirely with me for this situation. I've ruined my own life.

I have a gun and i'm having a lot of intrusive thoughts about shooting myself in the head but I don't think i'll actually do it because I have a son. I don't really know what I should do next though, for the first time in my life I feel completely lost, completely alone and with no control over my future.

I told him no i didnt cut it at all and then proceeded to explain that this was a histamine reaction and that she mustve missed a little bit. She said shes missed before and this never happens, ect.

Now looking at that pic theres no tracks at all. So im assuming she hasnt been using long and this is the first time its happened to her. To be fair, the first time this happened to me i was a bit freaked too. Now its happened so much over the decade i didnt think twice about it when he sent me that picture.

I dont think he believes me at all. So i would like if you guys could take a loom at that picture, post saying what you think happened, and maybe a tiny story of when this has happened to you.

Now unless you have cancer, or have been an existing pain management patient, you can only get 7 days worth of medicine at a time, and if a Dr. misses the fact you got opiods somewhere else, both prescribing doctors will face fines or loss of license.  


Plus after that 7 days, if not for cancer, then it is the patients responsibility to contact/request to get into pain management.  Also now, if more than 30% of any doctors patients are on opiods, they must reclassified even a family practice to a pain management center, giving them even less incentive to write.  I also take Valium for tremors related to my spine and nerve damage,  but the way the law is worded, my pain management Dr. said after the first of the year he's not even sure if it will be legal for him to write benzo scripts.

Basically my older brother who is a grown man (35) keeps relapsing and stealing our mom's pain pills. He was on Subuxone for about a year, quit the program a couple months ago and we just figured out he's been using and stealing from her, yet again. This is a cycle that just won't stop and neither of us know what to do. He's currently jobless and has been living with her (yet again) for the last year. We thought he was doing better, but he got hurt at work 6 months ago and hasn't worked since. His jobs last less than a year, he's jobless for a year, rinse and repeat. He's lived with her on and off since he was 27. 

She had a stockpile of Oxycodone for those just in case moments and now it's completely GONE. She had the pills hidden in her room and he had to really really dig to find them. About 400 pills just gone now. In his veins. I suspected he was using again a month ago but I didn't want to make claims because I thought we were past this, finally. After years of lying and stealing (money, family heirlooms, our grandmother's rings, my mom's rings, my son's piggie bank ffs, and of course her pain pills) I'm just sick and tired of it and ready to do something drastic.

I'm to the point where I want her to call the police on him. Or I will do it for her. Does it ever get any better? Will he ever quit this?? I understand it's an addiction and a mental health issue; I have a lot of sympathy for him - I was an opiate addict and have been completely sober the last 4 years. But he doesn't seem to want to stop. He's been homeless for a year and it still wasn't his rock bottom. Maybe jail would be his rock bottom that makes him ready to sober up? We're both at a loss and desperate for him to get healthy and be himself again.

This really rattled me as I'm worried that what I copped has fent in it after falling asleep so suddenly just from snorting, not sure if it's just really strong or what! Anyone have thoughts on whether it's safe to keep using it? I think I'm just going to take very small matchhead bumps from now on and wait at least half an hour between them.

I cannot promise your methadone clinic is willing, able, or qualified to transition you to kadian from methadone, but it's worth talking to your doctor and seeing if a switch might be a good idea for you. 

Like many of you on methadone, I stupidly allowed my dose to increase to a point where I was falling asleep everywhere and it was basically sucking the life out of me, and I was still using on top of my dose.I wanted back on subs, which served me quite well for a year before relapse, but the idea of getting down to 30mg, getting sick and hoping induction didn't destroy me wasn't an appealing to me. It was at that point that my dr recommended I try switching to Kadian and see if that might be a better fit for me. I thought about it for about 5 minutes and said, ""Let's do it. If it doesn't get me out of this rut, at least I'll be off the juice, on long acting morphine and the switch to buprenorphine (suboxone) won't be the terrifying drawn out process it is on methadone"". 

Dr agreed and I switched, that day, from 120mls methadone to 600mg Kadian. The next day was the first day in months I didn't fall asleep in the lunchroom and I actually had a sleep that didn't feel like a coma. 

I'm 2 weeks in now and have gone up to 750mg of Kadian daily. I feel better, more clear headed and motivated to do more with my time rather than vegetate in my apartment half watching Netflix and I have used a lot less dope on top of my prescribed daily dose of Morphine, which is good for my wallet, my health and my relationships with other humans. I had a pretty serious health scare last year (thoracic aortic dissection which resulted in a stroke which resulted in cortical blindness, left side weakness and a hard time speaking) and  really wasn't sure if I was interested in living anymore. Anything I can do to help me get out of this head space is welcome these days. It's hard for me to speak to people, so reaching out for help and getting involved with groups and strangers is a daunting task for me sometimes. I'd go so far as to say the Kadian is keeping me from feeling like a lump of shit, so I'm gonna go ahead and say it's doing something positive in my life. 

Tl;dr Kadian is now available in Canada as a opioid replacement med.  If you're having a rough go on methadone or you're interested in getting off dope and have tried both methadone and subs with no success, it can't hurt to give Kadian a try. Talk to your Dr... right?

It makes everything so real. I've heard it more and more as the years go on. 

""He overdosed on heroin"" still has some of that badass, taboo romanticism that is so alluring about opiates. *He was a deep, complex individual who couldn't handle the existential horror of modern life, and went hard in the paint until drifting off to a better place in a final act of protest against an unfair world.* 

""He lost his battle with addiction"" is just heartbreakingly sad. For me, it succinctly describes the years of struggle, self-loathing, the bitter pain of my family, the bright patches of recovery and hope followed by the darkness of relapse, repeated over and over until it ultimately ends with the dull, boring tragedy of becoming another statistic. 

It forces me to realize just how similar addiction is to something like cancer. It's terminal addiction for a lot of people. The odds aren't in our favor. They're not in my favor.

It also forces me to face the fact that this is exactly what they'll say about me if I overdose and die. 

*Loud_Mouths enjoyed reading, music, long walks on the beach, and loved his dog more than anything. Before his addiction took over he was full of life, always laughing and cracking jokes. Unfortunately, he was unable to overcome the mental health issues that drove him to use heroin. He fought hard, but ultimately lost his battle with heroin addiction on XX-XX-XXXX. We will always remember him as the vibrant son and brother he was before opiate addiction stole him from us. He is survived my his parents, siblings, and beloved dog Sparky.* 

I'm currently clean on subs. Reading the obits of people who pass from addiction always remind me of the stark reality of my precarious situation. 

If I relapse and die, people won't see it like I do: a romantic quest to relieve existential angst and an answer to the only question that matters (what is the meaning of life? To feel good, of course, hence the heroin). 

They will see it as an unfortunate person who struggled immensely to pull himself out of the deep pit of misery he had inflicted on himself. They won't see the good times, like I do, or through rose colored glasses. They will see my pain, my desire to be free of pain, and how I failed.They will see it as yet another sad tragedy in an endless string of tragedies. 

They will see someone they loved who essentially killed himself day by day even though he hated heroin and wanted nothing more than to be clean. It's hard to wrap my head around, and I lived it, so I can't even fathom how others see it. 

Sorry for the bummer, but it feels like every day another person I know, or am connected to, dies from this disease. And it's awful. This sub has been filled with depressing posts the last few days but maybe that's a good thing.

This is where I come in. I‚Äôve been sober from all opiates for about a year. Nothing I was committed to, I like to use them here and there but never had money to form a habit or a constant supplier. Anyway, he gives me a couple 8mg sub strips and sent me on my way. I got home, looked up dosages, cut it into 8 squares so I could take a smaller dose than 8mg since I currently have no tolerance. I took 1mg and decided to wait to see if I needed another. After 30 minutes or so I start feeling very nauseous. Nauseous enough that I wasn‚Äôt having fun. I had no trouble sleeping though. I woke up today and I was even more nauseous than before. Brain fog, weak stomach, head ache, weird head space, VERY tired (no euphoria) etc. it‚Äôs been going on all day and I have no idea what it is.

75qktf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/75qktf/anyone_else_been_on_methadone_tablets_for_pain/,28,https://redd.it/75qktf,JonWrong,Anyone else been on Methadone tablets for pain management? Opinions... ... ...,"Usually I post pics of stupid amounts of pills but today leaving the pharmacy I was wondering how uncommon it is in medicine to RX Methadone for chronic pain. In 13 years of pain control one way or another from 19 yrs old to now this is only the second time I've had a Dr willing to RX Methadone for pain management at home.

Is it just because of unfamiliar territory and the stigma behind Methadone? I've found time and time again if I'm listening to my objective mind on effective pain control and not my addicted mind that Methadone take the cake for me as a long acting narcotic that eliminates 70% or more of my pain. 

Beats Fentanyl, Morphine ER, OxyContin, Buprenorphine, and even Opana ER for me at what it's intended to do. Kill pain effectively and dosed in 2 doses a day (I've tried 3) it covers 24hrs easily. I also find I don't Fiend for it and run out early. Yet they are WAY more apprehensive about prescribing it to me even over Opana and Fentanyl.

Today the Dr upped my dose to let me have 40mg of Methadone (4x 10mg tablets instead of 2x 10mg which he only had me on for 2 weeks to see how it panned out as it's been 5 years since I found another Dr to RX me it. I was on 80mg (40mg 2x a day/8x 10mg tablets) and found that to be too much back then.

I have people thinking I'm crazy because I let them drop my 90 Percocet 10/325s to 60 (2x a day instead of 3x) in order to double the Methadone dose as I get way more relief out of 20mg extra Methadone then Losing 1 10mg Oxycodone. I also dropped from Xanax 2mg bars 2x a day to 3x 1mg Xanax footballs. Which most people think ""Why??? For Methadone?"" And he left my Dilaudid RX alone still for 150 D4s. 

I think I'm lucky to get ANY Benzos still when on tgatkajy pain killers with 1 being Methadone which a Methadone clinic will straight kick you out where I live for Benzos. Plus I'm getting my Adderall IR 20s 2x a day still. And this is all from my PCP as I lost my insurance. I'm in no position to hutch as that is 4 Schedule 2s and serious ones plus a Schedule 4 from a PCP.

Not to mention even if I splurge like I just did leaving the pharmacy. Eating 80mg of Oxy, 4mg Xanax, Banged 12mg of Dilaudid, and am just chillen and going to take the Methadone later. It's the ONE and only pain med I NEVER run out of so I'm never in fear of withdrawals and having no pain control. 

I'm just really wondering if anyone else has had this kind of amazing success rate with Methadone for chronic pain? Not for MMT. I've done that and the whole clinic every day, no Benzos, not being above to split your dose up, etc was unmanageable with my life and they treated me like garbage. Plus charging $10 a day for a drug that's $10 a month. 

The Dr told me as I also read online that they lumped Methadone in with Fentanyl in late 2016 to Jew regulations making it harder to get and I don't know if it's state to state, but making Dr's try a list of other ER Opioid medications first before considering Methadone. But it's been hard the whole last 13 years. 

Plus it's not like Methadone does not get you HIGH as fuck if you don't dose it every day. I skipped taking any the last day and a half and I know after a few days on Oxy and Ds that Methadone is no joke. After daily MMT on high doses of doesnt do much but if you break that up it sure as hell kills pain and can get you really HIGH. Dangerously high if you are not careful and that's you're goal.

I wonder of that's the big query about RX Methadone for pain. A person without a GOOD tolerance can OD on a very small amount, especially with Xanax. Also not understanding that it doesn't hit peak plasma levels for 4 hours and redosing only to cause an OD long after initially dosing. 

Sorry for my rant I live you guys and is he lying if I said I wasn't high after being out if my meds for almost 2 days. I'm high off of being pain/anxiety free... And opioids/benzos

Much love to my opiates fam!

He would manage to steal (?; is it stealing if it's just gonna be destroyed anyway?) most of the good stuff and resell it at school. He even gave a lot of stuff away for free if you were close like I was. That man had everything. Hyrocodone, Original and New Oxy, Adderall, Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Morphine, Codeine, Ritalin, Dilaudid, Opana (which I've only had once; it was from him for free and it was amazing!), and even some Fent patches (which scared me to death; still do).

I'm a morphine addict (IV ampuoles daily) totally maybe 60 mg on an average day. I don't go pick up my script until next week. Fianc√©e's older brother is an NP with a huge gambling problem, by the way, unless you're wondering how I get ampuoles prescribed and I'm a Chemical Engineer so 450 a month to him plus like 50 for filling it. Anyway, I only have 5 days until I can pick up again but I only have 200 mg worth left. That was gonna be a problem. Usually I don't have this issue but these last couple of weeks have been really rough and I've gotten seriously nodded more than usual. 


I was looking through my pockets of clothes in my hamper hoping to find even a another half full ampuole. They're 20mg/mL and 2 mL size and I mean actual IV prep not Oramorph.

 I've heard a lot of people claim only hospitals have those and not pharmacies. This is not true. It's just that it's so hard to get a script for that at home so most pharmacies have to custom order it when someone needs it. Anyway I've digressed from my point. 

No extra morphine but I did find a near full container of Ketamine (crystallized already) that I had lost while drunk and assumed gone. Pulling a quarter mL of the morphine (5mg total) a very small dose of the Ketamine that I rediluted in sterile saline (10 mg/mL diluted at .5 mL so 5 mg total) and sterile saline for the other quarter mL. 

Wifey (we're basically married in everything but on paper) found a good vein on the back of my leg and shot me up. Absolutely the best rush I've had in such a long time. 

I don't use my arms because of my job. I work for a company that develops new ways to process and use petroleum (oil). We make everything from plastics to fuels and even some medicine. (No stuff for getting high unfortunately. That's a totally different department anyway.) I work in the polymers lab. 

Even though I have a script it just wouldn't look good for me to have visible tracks so I use my arms very very rarely. I've actually put an IV connection in my arm before for a few days so I could give my legs a rest and I wouldn't have to poke myself over and over in the arm.

 Sorry for the rambling post I snorted coke because I thought Wifey was gonna be home soon but she forgot something at work. So it'll be an hour and now I'm bored but super excited and just wanted to tell yell this.

On April 1 this year, a woman sat down with investigators from the FBI, the Palm Beach County Sheriff‚Äôs Office and Palm Beach police and told a startling story.

She‚Äôd been held against her will, she said, for prostitution. And several other women were victims, too.

The man responsible, she said, was Kenneth ‚ÄúKenny‚Äù Chatman, an ex-felon and the founder of a Broward-based drug treatment facility and operator of several sober homes in Palm Beach County.

But instead of helping the women recover from addiction, the woman said Chatman was using one of the sober homes to keep them ‚Äúin a state of impairment in order to ‚Äòpimp‚Äô them out,‚Äù the PBSO detective wrote in his report.
Addiction treatment has become big business in Palm Beach County. It‚Äôs now the county‚Äôs largest industry after construction, tourism and agriculture.
Chatman, with just one drug treatment facility, called Reflections Treatment Center, and several sober homes, is a bit player in the billion-dollar industry. But may have taken it in a different direction: human trafficking, according to police reports.

A sheriff‚Äôs office report from this year called Chatman, 45, of suburban Boynton Beach, a suspect in ‚Äúpossible human trafficking and health fraud criminal activities.‚Äù

Police and the FBI have been investigating him but he hasn‚Äôt been arrested. Instead, his business is thriving. The Reflections corporation paid $1.1 million for a palatial home in a gated community southwest of Florida‚Äôs Turnpike and Hypoluxo Road in September and is soon opening a new drug treatment center on Military Trail in Lake Worth, called Journey to Recovery.

Chatman said he‚Äôs not even involved in sober homes, though. Anything to the contrary is gossip, he told The Post in two brief phone interviews and a written statement.

‚ÄúIf you know anything about this industry, people say a lot of stories and make up things along the way,‚Äù he said in a December interview.

He did not directly respond to allegations of prostitution, saying only that Reflections provides services to prostitutes as it does anyone else.

‚ÄúI would never, knowingly put any of the clients of Reflections Treatment Center or any other vulnerable young person in harm‚Äôs way,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAllegations to the contrary are unfounded and harmful.‚Äù

He said he only helps people.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here trying to help the sick and suffering. That‚Äôs what my passion is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf you need help ‚Ä¶ give me a call. I‚Äôm that friend that could help you.‚Äù

Drugs in sober homes?

Police reports, official records, court filings and the ruined lives left in his wake tell a different story.

After Tina Pekar‚Äôs 27-year-old son overdosed and died in one of Chatman‚Äôs homes near Boynton Beach last year, she vowed to him: ‚ÄúI am not going to stop until I find out what you‚Äôre doing and shut you down.‚Äù

Four former clients and someone who oversaw one of the houses told The Palm Beach Post that they witnessed drug use in his sober homes.

The incidents in his halfway houses apparently were serious enough to prompt Reflections‚Äô medical director to resign abruptly last year.

‚ÄúDue to information I received about serious irregularities at the housing affiliated with Reflections and also the operation of Reflections Treatment Center, I have no choice but to resign my position,‚Äù the doctor wrote in his resignation letter, obtained by The Post.

Chatman and his businesses also have been on the radar of The Florida Association of Recovery Residences, which provides guidelines for sober homes. The Florida Department of Children and Families recently picked FARR to certify sober homes statewide under a new state law.

Although neither Chatman nor his homes have sought FARR certification, Lehman said the organization has received many complaints about Chatman.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve received numerous complaints of various different natures,‚Äù Lehman said. ‚ÄúIn the case of Mr. Chatman, it‚Äôs an endless stream.‚Äù

Lehman said earlier this year Chatman‚Äôs lawyer sent him a ‚Äúcease and desist‚Äù letter for making ‚Äúfalse and defamatory‚Äù statements about him. Lehman denied making false statements and said he forwarded some complaints to law enforcement.

Woman disappeared

The woman who contacted PBSO and the FBI with prostitution allegations earlier this year said that Chatman, with the help of another man, took photos of the women and posted them on a website, according to the police report. She named the man, the website and the general area of the home.

The man named in the report denied knowing Chatman to The Post. Both PBSO and the FBI declined to discuss the case.

Chatman‚Äôs name also surfaced in another PBSO report this year.

Deputies were called after a woman disappeared from a Chatman sober home on 48th Street in Mangonia Park. After the woman‚Äôs parents spoke to WPTV NewsChannel 5, PBSO said it had received an anonymous tip that the woman was being listed on Backpage.com as an escort, according to the report. Escorts post advertisements on the site.

PBSO couldn‚Äôt verify the complaint.

Two days later, Chatman found her, he said, wandering high in a Pompano Beach park, the woman‚Äôs mother told PBSO, according to the report. She told police Chatman took her daughter to Reflections in Margate just a few minutes away.

Chatman said in his December interview that he did hear about a missing woman, but had no involvement in her disappearance and denied speaking to anyone‚Äôs mother about it.

‚ÄúI found a young lady in the park and I brought her back to Reflections?‚Äù he asked, after being told about the police report. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything about finding someone in a park. ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt recall any of that.‚Äù

Insurance lifeblood

Addiction recovery usually follows three core steps: detox, rehab and intensive outpatient treatment, known as IOP.

All three are crucial steps on the road to recovery. Detox and rehab helps wean addicts off their addiction to drugs or alcohol, and the patients usually live on-site.

IOP helps reintroduce addicts to the outside world. The treatment can include therapy sessions, prescription medication and drug testing.

While going to IOP, patients usually live in sober homes, also known as halfway houses. Well-run sober homes are highly structured, often with strict curfews and zero tolerance toward drug and alcohol use. Poorly run homes can be chaotic nuisances that are the bane of neighbors and police.

Insurance is the lifeblood of the addiction treatment industry, since the companies are required to pay for care, including IOP and the drug-testing that goes with it.

And drug-testing is the most lucrative part of the business. Absurd charges for urine tests have attracted the FBI. The Post found one bill for nine months of tests at a treatment center not owned by Chatman topped $300,000, for example.

Chatman‚Äôs Reflections Treatment Center in Margate provides IOP.

Chatman says on various sites online he‚Äôs Reflections‚Äô founder and director of operations, and he is widely considered by clients and employees to be the true owner.

‚ÄúThe owner, Kenny Chatman, has really helped me through a lot,‚Äù a woman identified as a client says in a Reflections video on YouTube. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known him for two years before the treatment center was even established and, I mean, I call him at 2 in the morning, he picks me up. He‚Äôs given me a lot of chances.‚Äù

Secret Service arrest

Officially, the company is in the name of Chatman‚Äôs wife, Laura.

That‚Äôs probably because Reflections never would have been approved by the state had Chatman himself applied.

The state does background checks on owners of drug treatment centers. Chatman is a felon, having served seven months in federal prison in 2009 for skimming credit cards. He had asked a waitress to steal credit card numbers using a device he gave her, court files show.

The Secret Service, which handles financial crimes, arrested him in 2008.

Chatman also was charged with assault, harassment and menacing in 1996 in New York City, where he grew up.

It‚Äôs unclear how or why he got into the addiction treatment business, but he was running sober homes at least as early as 2012, police reports show.

By 2013, he opened Reflections in a Broward strip mall with Shannel Escoffery, who now works for another treatment center. Chatman‚Äôs wife, Laura, had a 70 percent stake in the company and Escoffery 30 percent, according to a lawsuit filed by Escoffery against Laura Chatman.

The lawsuit claims Chatman and his wife forged Escoffery‚Äôs signature on documents so they could cut her from the business. It also claims that Chatman took money out of the company‚Äôs coffers to pay for personal expenses, including cruises.

Name appears 17 times

Chatman flatly denies that either he or Reflections owns or operates sober homes.

In his written statement, he said Reflections provides transportation to and from its business and sober homes, but ‚Äúwe do not operate or set policy for any of those facilities.‚Äù

Nonetheless, his name appears in 17 sheriff‚Äôs office reports for incidents affiliated with halfway houses.

West Palm Beach records leave no doubt, for example, that Chatman rented and operated a sober home at 3401 Westview Ave. in West Palm Beach‚Äôs Northwood Hills neighborhood this year.

‚ÄúThis property has been rented to Reflections Treatment Center and Kenneth Chatman. We are aware this is a sober home,‚Äù a real estate agent wrote to a city employee in August, after a Reflections employee filed records with the city.

His chain of sober homes are known as the Stay‚Äôn Alive homes, according to PBSO reports.

While investigating a robbery and battery between two housemates at a Lake Worth sober home in 2013, both the victim and the house manager told a deputy the house was known as ‚ÄúStaying Alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI then met with Ken Chatman, treatment facility manager,‚Äù the deputy wrote in his report. ‚ÄúChatman knows all of the patients in his care and assigned to this house.‚Äù

Chatman told The Post that Stay‚Äôn Alive was a gym where he was a general manager until it closed in 2012.

He also said he‚Äôs never talked to an officer at a sober home, although in 11 PBSO reports involving sober homes, deputies noted they either spoke to Chatman on the phone or in person.

In some of the reports, Chatman was the one who contacted police, usually reporting vandalism by someone in the home.

Chatman told The Post, ‚ÄúI can assure you, I‚Äôve never spoken to a police officer at the scene of a sober home.‚Äù

Denies ‚Äòflop houses‚Äô

Chatman could want to distance himself from the sober homes to avoid legal liability for what happens inside them.

Four former clients and a person who oversaw one of his houses told The Post that they witnessed drug use in his homes, even though sober homes are meant to be drug-free.

‚ÄúThere was drug use, needles, syringes all over the place,‚Äù Vincent Patterson, who oversaw a home near Boynton Beach, said. ‚ÄúAny given day you stick your hand under the couch, you‚Äôd find a rig.‚Äù

A rig is slang for anything used to inject drugs.

The woman who went to PBSO and the FBI with prostitution allegations called Chatman‚Äôs sober homes ‚Äúflop houses,‚Äù which the detective described in his report as ‚Äúa drug rehabilitation house which is failing at providing services.‚Äù

Chatman, in denying responsibility for sober homes, added that the places often are unduly labeled ‚Äúflop houses.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I had a dollar for every time somebody said a sober home was a flop house, I‚Äôd be a millionaire by now,‚Äù he said.

Wouldn‚Äôt let her leave

Police reports reflect a chaotic environment in the homes, with PBSO deputies responding to calls over fights, robberies, break-ins and vandalism. In one incident at a Lake Worth house last year, a cab driver called police after a patient failed to pay a fare. Multiple deputies responded and found the man hiding in a shed behind the house.

In several reports, patients claim that Chatman took their phone or other belongings without returning them.

In 2012, a woman called police on Chatman, claiming he wouldn‚Äôt let her leave a sober home in Royal Palm Beach and wouldn‚Äôt return her belongings. When her boyfriend showed up, Chatman parked his car behind the boyfriend‚Äôs car, blocking him in, they told police.

A PBSO deputy resolved the situation.

‚ÄúI met with Mr. Chatman and advised him that he could not force (the woman) to stay at this home without a court order,‚Äù the deputy wrote in his report. ‚ÄúI further told Chatman that he had to permit (the woman) to go with her property.‚Äù

Chatman chalked up his documented links to sober homes to rumors and gossip.

‚ÄúI hear a lot of stories about myself,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stop people from saying my name for whatever reason.‚Äù

Chatman leaves a limited paper trail, renting the homes and, in at least two cases, has Reflections employees file paperwork with the city for approval.

But when Chatman was months behind on rent at a Royal Palm Beach home, the owner filed paperwork in court to evict him in 2013.

The owner also called PBSO when he saw the condition Chatman left the place.

‚ÄúHe saw broken glass throughout the house, numerous trash left on the floor, holes in the walls, ceiling fans broken, rugs in the toilet, light fixtures broken, closet doors broken and other items broken,‚Äù a deputy wrote in his report.

Heroin tragedy

Ryan Pekar came to Florida in 2013 with two of his brothers, all three of them Ohioans with a mission to get clean. His two brothers went back after a few months of successful treatment.

But Ryan Pekar struggled, said Tina, his mom.

He went into rehab multiple times, eventually ending up in one of Chatman‚Äôs sober homes near Boynton Beach.

His girlfriend, also an addict, shared a room with him in the four-bedroom, 2,100-square-foot home.

On Sept. 14 last year, the girlfriend bought heroin in a nearby grocery store parking lot. That night, she went to their room, used it, experienced a rush she never had felt before, and passed out, according to PBSO reports.

The house manager, Patterson, took her into a shower to revive her.

An ambulance came to get her and Pekar was distraught that paramedics wouldn‚Äôt let him go with her. He wanted a ride to the hospital, but Patterson told him to call Chatman first, according to the PBSO report.

Chatman told him to pack his things and leave, Patterson told deputies. Pekar went to his room and locked the door.

After a while, his roommates knocked on the door and got no response. They alerted Patterson, who told police he went to find a key and unlocked the door.

Pekar was slumped over the table in his room, blue in the face. He would never wake up, and an autopsy later would reveal he died of an overdose.

When Pekar‚Äôs mother called Chatman, she said he seemed genuinely upset. She asked him to send her son‚Äôs clothes, and he agreed.

‚ÄúI wanted to smell them, to see if they still smelled like him,‚Äù she told The Post. ‚ÄúThat was one of the biggest mistakes I could have made.‚Äù

The clothes arrived in a box. Nearly all of them were unrecognizable. Some were women‚Äôs clothes, she said.

Also in the box: her son‚Äôs needles.

She wonders if they were deliberately included.

‚ÄúMy husband wants to believe nobody would be that cruel,‚Äù she said.

Preventable death?

When she called Chatman about a month later, looking for answers, she said he acted like it had never happened. He denied ever having a sober home at that address, too.

‚ÄúI had called him back and he said, ‚ÄòRyan who?‚Äô And then he tried to say he never talked to me,‚Äù she said.

Shortly after Pekar‚Äôs death, Chatman moved the residents to a new house, Patterson, who oversaw the home, told The Post.

Chatman said he had nothing to do with it.

‚ÄúI heard about that and my condolences to the family,‚Äù he told The Post. ‚ÄúThat has nothing to do with me at all.‚Äù

Tina Pekar believed her son was doing well. He hadn‚Äôt been kicked out of the house and she said Chatman told her he had been passing his drug tests.

In her last conversation with Chatman, she vowed to him that she would take him down. But she since has learned that there‚Äôs little oversight of sober homes, and even fewer ways to make sure parents are sending their children to a safe place.

‚ÄúSomething has to be done with these halfway houses,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe parents think these places are fine and they‚Äôre not.‚Äù

Her son‚Äôs ashes are now in an urn, wrapped in his baby blanket.

It makes her wonder.

‚ÄúHow do you send your son away on a plane and he comes back in the mail?‚Äù

What The Post reported

The addiction treatment industry is Palm Beach County‚Äôs fourth largest, generating $1 billion in revenue every year. It is now the focus of an FBI task force.

The BC Coroners Service says the number of overdose deaths in the province during the first eight months of this year has now surpassed the total number of overdose deaths in 2016.

According to the BC Coroners Service, 1,013 have died from a suspected illicit drug overdose so far this year. In 2016, 922 people died from a suspected drug overdose.

Preliminary data indicates that there were 113 suspected drug overdose deaths in August, which is more than 3.5 deaths per day and a 79 per cent increase from August 2016.

Chief Coroner Lisa Lapointe called the number of deaths heartbreaking.

‚ÄúThis highlights the complexities of drug dependency and illicit drug use, and the importance of a coordinated, health-focused approach to this medical issue,‚Äù she said in a statement.

Fentanyl was detected either alone or with another drug in more than 80 per cent of the deaths, according to the latest figures for 2017. In most cases, fentanyl was combined with other illicit drugs ‚Äì most often heroin, methamphetamines or cocaine.

Lapointe said it‚Äôs important for people to know that no illicit substance in the province can be considered safe, whether you know the dealer or not.

‚ÄúAnyone using an illicit substance must be prepared for an adverse effect and must have someone else present who is willing and able to help.‚Äù

The BC Coroners Service said Vancouver had the highest rate of deaths in the province. There have been 255 drug overdose deaths in Vancouver this year. Surrey has the second highest number at 123 deaths followed by Victoria at 65 deaths.

Almost three out of every four deaths involved people between the ages of 30 and 59 years. Four out of five deaths were male. Ninety per cent of deaths occurred indoors and there were no deaths at supervised consumption or drug-overdose prevention sites.",1507837204.0

On a good day, it feels like I had my ass kicked two days ago. My body (neck, back, ribs) feel tender and my muscles feel generally sore. This is accompanied a mild to moderate headache that I've had for as long as I can remember. On bad days, my eyes feel like they're being ripped out of my face. My headaches are blinding. I have growths on either side of my jaw that cause an insane amount of pressure in my jaw and teeth. The muscles in my back clump and seize and I get these wet, hot, tingly, electric stabbing pains and... Anyways you get the point.

What I'm trying to say is, despite starting out a relatively happy person, I consider suicide every day. I don't feel like I can do this anymore and I honestly don't want to. I've lost more to this than I can really mention.

Aaaand the reason that I'm telling you that is because I am now being prescribed percocet (oxycodone 5mg/ acetaminophen 325mg). And I get what I'm assuming is a relatively high supply of it. I haven't been on them very long but taking 4 to 8 perocet (and half quarter of pot) in a day has immensely changed the quality of my life. I feel comfortable in my body and without the majority of my pain. The headaches are either dulled or gone completely, my joints and muscles feel like they did 10 years ago - which is to say they feel like nothing. It's amazing. Even the random electric hot stabbing pains are dulled to a point that they're almost a parody of themself. I can feel them and they definitely feel wierd but they don't hurt.

Now, when I see my kids (oh yeah, I lost the love of my life and my two beautiful boys when the depression that accompanied the pain made me too much to deal with) , I am the dad I want to be. I play with them, we run around, roll around, toss them in the air and shit. Its the best. 

Its honestly pathetic how much my life looks like a commercial for Perdue Pharmaceuticals. 

Except, I know how this ends. I see headlines all the time about opiod related deaths, I am aware that we live in an opiod addiction crisis. I've read the statistics.

My problem ultimately is that without the drugs, I am suicidal and honestly kind of unhinged when I'm by myself. Its embarrassing to tell you the truth. If I take the drugs though, I feel excited about life again but eventually they're probably either going to kill me or lead me to the thing that does.

Has anyone else also had to make this choice? Is it better to force yourself through a life that you hate and want to die everyday, or should I continue to allow myself to be the poor man's House so that I can try to salvage the sanity, social life, personal relationships, etc that I've missed so much.

Sorry to be dramatic. I completely understand that some if you are in way worse situations. But this is my version of a big deal. I really do appreciate any advice.

I've had chronic pain for a while so I've been around the ringer but I just had surgery and I've never ever felt pain on this level before I would say it was 20 out of 10 and it's made me reconsider everything I ever thought about pain and pain management.

I swore I would never use a needle and I found myself begging for one on multiple nights because of the pain. I shot myself up for the first time guessing the dose in desperation. 

right now I get 3 15 mg OxyContin a day and 8 10 mg oxycodone a day. It's barely enough to manage my pain this is the amount of pain meds I was on before I had surgery with way way way less pain than this.

My current pain doctor is actually a regular doctor Who I asked to take over my case and he's been really good open till now he's trying to do what he thinks is good for me which is ween me off the painkillers but this post surgical pain there's no way I can go down if anything I have to go double or triple.  it's taking over my life. it's having me and my family members doing things we never thought we do buying pills and needles  I'm thinking about buying heroin for the first time and dilaudid off the darknet i've been to the hospital six times out of the past 8 nights. The bills are adding up and they're not even barely giving me anything. 

besides switching to a better chronic pain doctor by the way I live in (removed) y if anyone wants to PM me a recommendation to someone or somewhere that sympathetic to people in pain. 

(removed) ugh 1 mg of diauded is good but I honestly feel like I could take two or three easily. 

I think I'm one of those people that requires a large dose or else my pain is just so high that it takes an insane amount to even touch it.  i'm 28 and the doctors all look at me like I'm just drug seeking. I've even had my pain psychologist say that when pain medicines the only thing that helps you can't fucking blame someone for drug seeking when they're in pain.

tonight for example I woke up in the most excruciating pain ever it had a reality painted completely in this pain version of reality I took my OxyContin I took some Xanax I popped and Oxsee 10 and I crushed and snorted an Oxy 10.

When the drip hit I am mediately felt oh my God thank you like please this is mercy. I am mediately went and crashed tomorrow Oxy 10's and finally I was able to be a human again. 

I suddenly remembered I had half of a blue Oxsee 30 and I went and found that and crushed it and I finally feel back to my old self like in control of my mind and my emotions.  

I am literally coming here for advice what should I do should I buy Oxsee off the street and just keep trying to convince my doctor and just add my own stuff on the side all low-key. 

should I buy dope and micron filter it into shots. 

should I go on the dark web and by di lauded because the bio availability is eight times stronger when is IV.

this isn't about addiction (not trying to knock any recreational users) butthis is an about saving my health I'm going to shoot myself if I can't get this pain under control. ITS LIFE OR DEATI FOR ME.

 I'm dying here and nobody will take me seriously the hospital give me 1 mg of dilauded and that's it.

It's  enough to stop the tears from streaming down and 28 your old man's face I'm not a pussy by the way oh I'm a bad ass motherfucker put this amount of pain will bring anyone trembling to their knees I don't care how fucking hard you are or how tough you think you are this pain will own you.

give me the best advice for my health because honestly I don't know how about long if I can get my body to last if I'm shooting and at the same time snorting pills clogs up your nose and shit. 

obviously if I could just take a pill or have a pain pump and planted that would be best but give me some advice here guys I need pain relief now what the fuck should I do of the choices above or is there some other new choice I'm not considering?

How long does heroin stay in your system usually? What are some experiences you've had with urine tests and heroin? I know for myself, heroin can get out of my system relatively fast (3-4 days tops after using several times.) Well, the main question I was getting at was this: If one were to inject heroin on Friday at 11 AM, would they be clean for a urine test Monday at 3:30-4:30pm? Assuming they were clean prior to that single use and only used a little less than .1 of some pretty fire shit by IV (injecting)? I would like to know, for probation. What are the chances of being clean by the time I have to drop? And what are methods that have worked for you/others to get the drug out of your system as fast as possible (methods that you ACTUALLY know work and tried or knew someone who tried it.) I know H metabolizes into morphine within 24 hours and the morphine is what usually is tested in a urine test (dipstick test) but please, tell me what you think the drug stays in your system on average, and about your experiences with drug tests for using heroin and if its possible to drop clean in 48 hours after single use and what methods work best for detox.",1507929549.0

Wanted to get back to chipping. I used at the beginning of the week that we planned to go on vacation. I had this weird sick hangover just from one day of using and when I snorted some H after the end of a day of feeling shitty I felt fine. So I kept this going for the vacation that was later in the week. Then I just didn't want to get sick because of other small obligations/work finally the schedule has nothing but I did have to miss a friend's see the new place party because I was sick. 


I didn't use this time like I used to. A G at minimal tolerance would last a week to week 1/2. I made a G last 3 and a .5 last over a week. Bought that last half G because I would have ended up sick at two concerts my gf booked almost a year in advance. I would only use once in the morning and once at night. Previously I would bump all day.


The first 36 hours were total shit. I drugged myself into a gaba benzo tylenol advil coma. I slept the best i ever have while withdrawing. I woke up today with pain but very little of the other stuff. I'm at 48hrs now. I was expected last night and today to be the worst. I'm just scared it's going to come back hard but I'm gunna do some chores while I can. The only drug that is possibly effecting me still form last night is gaba. I did have restless legs and was starting to freak out because it was more of a restless whole body.  I was next to my gf on the couch and I did not want to let her notice anything last night. 

Somehow I crashed on the couch and then I went to bed at like 4am. Woke up earlier than normal but still a solid sleep. Excited and scared for the trials to come. I have gone through withdrawals so many times so I know they can linger. I just hope I'm somehow out of the worst of the acute stage so relatively soon.

I will not go back to chipping. I will never buy heroin again. Last time I quit for that year I did it knowing I would come back. I was never truly ready to stop forever and I admitted it to my gf. But now I know the high is just not worth it. All the costs are too high for this drug. I will be honest and I think I will pick up a weekend's worth of pills once in a blue moon, but I will never do heroin again. I truly believe that. I was finally feeling normal in every sense of the word over this past year. These past few months have been stressful because of work, but I felt healthy and good. Weed and other lighter drugs were good enough.

I just want to get back to that place. I just want to be back to normal again. I hate this drug and I hate feeling like this. I only think Heroin is truly great during the time you are physically addicted. That's the only time there is very little side affects like nausea. At the start and and at the end with withdrawing are the times H sucks for me. Never missed work or sold anything, just wasted money that could be better used for paying off credit cards or car. I was very outgoing and had a lot of fun those weeks I was on it, I probably got the most laughs per day when I was on H. But I think I did that to over compensate for the heroin keeping me chill and low.

Anyways it just felt good to type this out. There is no person I can talk to. My girlfriend might have noticed, but hasn't said anything to respect my privacy. I don't know what I would do without her. Or if somebody had to explain to my 10 year old brother why I'm gone forever. Or make my mom go through any more loss.

I just hope the rest of this withdrawal doesn't suck too bad and I can go back to normal life.",1508082653.0

Travis found me at Cafe Tazza, which was supposed to be a place for hippies, but ownership hated us.  We chased the tourists away with our body odor and grease caked pores, blowing hits of weed at their kids.  We badmouthed the owners for selling out and never bought more than a cup of black coffee with refills.

So, Travis came to find me, except he wasn‚Äôt really looking for me.  He needed a ride for his uncle, but we both knew he didn‚Äôt have an uncle.

‚ÄúSure, I have to be back to work at Ogelvies for four.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool.  He‚Äôs back at Geoff‚Äôs.  We have to get something out of his car.‚Äù


Minutes later my blue S 10 idled in the shade of Geoff‚Äôs gravel driveway.  It was my beautiful blue truck until I forgot to put antifreeze in the radiator, then it was an immovable eyesore that the grass grew around in the front yard of Cheo‚Äôs house on Montoya.  The death of that truck marked the death of my 8-month stint of sobriety.  Well 8 months is what I told my parents and Cheo.  It was more like 4 months, and I was smoking meth the whole time.

‚ÄúBob‚Äôs 73 years old and from Woodstock.  He showed up earlier this week and flipped his car down a ravine 2 nights ago.  The highway patrol said he flipped it at least six times and walked back up himself.  A real miracle.  He had to throw his stash and scale before he could walk back up.‚Äù  I pretended not to notice that Bob was not his uncle at 73 years old.  ‚ÄúWe just have to help him get something out of his car, in Questa.‚Äù

Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk.  He had an exaggerated limp.  The racket of the door, swinging and creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking.  There was no one except us, but he made accusations.  He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat.  Travis squeezed between us.

‚ÄúF***ing imbeciles!  I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in my life.  Just a pile of horse s***!‚Äù  Over time, I would learn that this was his default.  Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.

‚ÄúI know.  I know.  I talked to Geoff about it.  He said he didn‚Äôt know anything about it and blamed it on Christine.  I don‚Äôt believe it, though.‚Äù

Some drama I wasn‚Äôt privy to, but I found out later that his dog was missing.  It was one of two times that Geoff and Christine had stolen and traded the old man‚Äôs pure bread Pekinese to Edward for coke, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double wide on the south side of town.  He was unusually sweaty.  His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder.  Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his baldhead to the stained waistband of his shorts, and he sweat.  His shirt was always off, and his health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.

Once after Eddie moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room.  I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house.  It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway.  Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers.  That was the main reason I broke in.  We walked up to the Conoco and put gas into a milk jug with the silver dollars.  His neighbors saw us do it, but Taos is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.

Eventually the old man‚Äôs dog got eaten by coyotes, in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me.  The old man had bad luck.

‚ÄúBob, this is Riley.  Riley, this is Bob.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Indomitable Buffalo, they can‚Äôt keep me down!  Buffalo Bob Cass!  Pleased to meet you!‚Äù  His tone and attitude completely changed.  It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band, Rick Danko.  He even stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers.   Levon couldn‚Äôt stand Buffalo though.  He thought he was a piece of garbage.


We passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab.  Bob coughed hardest.  He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in can of soup, probably from the wreck.  Travis looked at me horrified.  Bob acted like he didn‚Äôt hear it and took every hit he could.  On his move to Taos, he stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it.  The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail.  Somehow he lost his U haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.

As we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces.  Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests.  The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of 5th gear.  To the left a vast expanse of desert territory opened up and summoned my imagination.  They said Taos was still the wild, wild west, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses.  Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning.  It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up towards Colorado.

Funny how people are when they ask you for something, especially junkies.  Bob wasn‚Äôt Travis‚Äô uncle.  He made it sound like his car was down the street or in Ranchos worst-case scenario but not 20 miles away in a different town.  There was almost no way I‚Äôd be back by four.  Travis nor Bob had any clue where his car was, not a number to call, not the name of a junkyard, nothing.  It may not have even been in Questa, and I bet anything that whatever they wanted out of the car wasn‚Äôt in it anyway.  But that‚Äôs how it goes for a junkie in Taos.

At a gas station we pondered what to do.  Bob didn‚Äôt have any ideas.  Travis was busy smoking heroin in the bathroom, and there are untold junkyards in Questa.  Bob and I sat in the truck and smoked cigarettes waiting for Travis.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go in and see what‚Äôs taking him?‚Äù  It had been over 20 minutes, and when I walked into the gas station Travis was on an office chair behind the counter.  His face was green and body doubled over.  He held his gut with his hands.

Before I got back out the door an ambulance pulled up.  They loaded him onto the gurney and into the back.  It was a bad case of gas as far as I could tell from his diet of pure sugar and the irregular bowel movements of an opiate addict.  A gloved hand grabbed a tube of lubricant and a rubber tube in the window, before they pulled away.  I shook my head and walked back to the S10.

‚ÄúWell?  What the hell is taking so long?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance came and took him.  He looked like his gut was in a knot.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmbulance?  Really?‚Äù  The truck was 15 feet away while they loaded Travis into the back, but somehow Bob had missed it.  ‚ÄúAre you sure?  I guess he won‚Äôt be coming back with us then.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.  No, he won‚Äôt.  Probably what he ate gave him a stomach ache.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he have?‚Äù

‚ÄúA giant moon pie and a bunch of orange soda.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, no s***!  What did he think was going to happen?  Eating like that!  F***ing imbecile!‚Äù

Bob got silent and turned away as if he forgot what he said.  He looked out of the passenger window, pensive and still, pondering some deep truth about life.  Dark clouds gathered over the horizon, and the aura of heroin and his tiny pupils were peaceful, quiet for a moment.  His long grey hair barely touched the collar of his leather coat.  It was proof of the wisdom only 73 years of life can give.

The crinkle of cellophane broke the silence in the truck.  He pushed it back before his dentures ripped a chunk of moon pie into his mouth.  The gold handle of his cane rested on a 64-ounce fountain drink between his legs.

‚ÄúF***ing imbeciles, I tell ya!  I‚Äôve never seen anything like it in all my life.  Well, let‚Äôs get going.‚Äù



I started writing about Bob as soon as he moved in.  My plans were for a book.  The first line went,

‚ÄúThe heartache.  The headache.  The stink of watery, green feces sprayed on the walls and puddled on my landlord‚Äôs carpet.‚Äù  The carpet was new when I moved in.  Brand new, and Bob ruined it.  On top of my plans for a book about Bob, I had dreams of being a poet at that time of my life.  It took me years to realize that I hated poetry.  

He began to detox in a bad way, the beginning of a dramatic and obscenity-laden affair of about two months.  He kept a welcome mat on the floor next to his bed, and I picked it up out of curiosity one day.  Underneath were at least nine cigarette burns where the cigarettes had burned from end to end on the carpet, but the mat was also completely caked with green poop.  Between the toilet and his bed, the green trail proved he was not well.  There was at least one spray of lime green on the wall by the door.

Bob was a self-proclaimed junkie through and through.  He knew it.  He told so many stories of all the dope he had done and where he did it and how good it was and who he did it with.  Those days were gone though, and 73 is not so kind to a junkie.

We were all dying like him.  It was only more obvious that he was on his way out.  Dead men and dead women walking, we looked for life in death, because staring death in the face was the only time we felt alive.  Everywhere we went, our environments changed to match the death inside of us, but we lied about it to ourselves and to everyone else.  None of us believed it, but we lied about that too and pretended that this was what we wanted.

We did meth and heroin and smoked cigarettes in his room, dubbed the shooting gallery.  Bob needed a medical detox, but he had a habit of saying he was going in and not doing it.  I dropped him off before a six-hour shift at Ogelvie‚Äôs one morning.  When I came back to the house, I went into his room to find information on how to visit.  But, he sat in his bed smoking a cigarette.

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get out of detox? Or did you ever go?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked me out.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey kicked you out?  Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúToo much trouble.  They said they weren‚Äôt prepared for me.  Too much s***ing.  Too much runny nose.  Said they didn‚Äôt expect me to be s***ing all over the place like that.‚Äù

On another morning I opened my eyes to see him sliding his thermal underwear over his foot.  It was the first thing I saw, and the fabric got caught on his big toe nail.

‚ÄúCome on, you f***ing b***!‚Äù  He screamed at his underwear and pulled harder.  He ripped the big toe nail out of his foot.




I slept with a few different girls while I lived at that place, one named Luanne.  Some people tell you they are bipolar, and others you find vacuuming your living room at 4 a.m., dancing to dubstep and smoking a bowl of weed but you know that they don‚Äôt do meth.  Luanne was that kind of bipolar, and she spent the night with me sometimes.  We were good friends.  

I saw another girl who panhandled change in the parking lots during the days and had my mother‚Äôs name.  She was beautiful in a weathered kind of way like some old momma you find at the pound, worn and scarred by the world but beautiful because of it.  Bob called all my women by the same name: that f***ing whore.


Anytime we went somewhere he would tell strangers of the abuse he suffered at my house.  It was humiliating and largely untrue, but one hipster kid bought Bob‚Äôs line and sneered at me for my inhumanity.  He would take Bob to his house in Tres Piedras and care for the old man as any decent human would.  The guy made a big show of how altruistic (one of Bob‚Äôs favorite words) he was and what a disgrace I was.  Travis and I laughed so hard that we had to put our hands on our knees to keep from falling on our faces.  
The next morning, I found them in the hipster‚Äôs Nissan in the parking lot behind Tazza.  Bob sat in the passenger seat with an unlit Native 100 between his lips and acted excited to see me, too excited, like he needed something, like things weren‚Äôt working out with the hipster.
‚ÄúHey, Riley!  I‚Äôm so happy to see you!‚Äù
‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶. Are you now, Bob?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh yeah!  Extremely.‚Äù  He turned to the hipster in the driver‚Äôs seat. ‚ÄúHey, you, where in the f*** is my phone?‚Äù
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where in the f*** your phone is!  It‚Äôs your phone!  Why don‚Äôt you keep track of it?‚Äù  I agreed with the kid.  It wasn‚Äôt his responsibility, and they yelled some more before the old man came back to my place.  



Bob got healthier while he lived with me, and my heroin habit grew.  He put on weight and got his bodily functions under control for the most part.  After two months it was time for him to leave, and he had a place rented in El Prado.  I packed his stuff into the back of my truck, and for some reason he called me a, ‚ÄúF***ing piece of s***!  You know that? A real piece of s***!‚Äù

After all I did for him I had it.  I had only ever touched him with care and concern.  All the times he went to the hospital, I visited him.  When he came back from a CT scan, I patted his head and held his hand.  At night before he slept, I washed and rubbed those two petrified pieces of mahogany he called feet and lathered them with tiger balm, but now I had him by the collar and my fist cocked back behind my head and bit my lip.  ‚ÄúOh what?  You‚Äôre gonna hit a sick old man are you?  Bet you feel real tough!  Don‚Äôt you boy?  You‚Äôre real tough now!‚Äù  I threw his boots into the back of my truck and took him to his new place.  My back tires sprayed him with muddy snow and gravel when I tore out of his driveway.

After he moved out, my manager at Ogelvie‚Äôs, Tiffany asked me about him.

‚ÄúHe said, he thought he was bothering you a little bit or something.‚Äù

‚ÄúA little bit?‚Äù  We both laughed.

He had been in on a Saturday afternoon to watch his Iowa football team play Ohio.  Tiffany said he kept walking around the place ‚Äúgrabbing himself.‚Äù  She called me to come watch him, and in case things got crazy I could take him away.




Ogelvie‚Äôs fired me for acting goofy when I came out of the bathroom and wearing sunglasses to wash dishes and the weird film that collected in the corners of my mouth and for obnoxiously ranting at customers.  A week after that I defaulted on the rent at my place.  When my landlord came to see me, we talked for 30 minutes in the cold next to the shattered front window while addicts lurked around inside.  He was nice about telling me I had to go, but when he left I found a loaded syringe behind my ear.  The weather had already cracked the engine block in my S10.

Before I moved out Bob called me to tell me he broke his hip and that he was staying in the old folks‚Äô home by the hospital.  We hadn‚Äôt talked since the day I almost punched him, so I went to visit him.

‚ÄúYah!  Fell on the ice on the road up to my house coming back from the movie store.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did you rent?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!  Some s*** flick about a hit man.  Whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt worth shattering my hip.  That was it, though, when I fell.  I couldn‚Äôt do anything, and it was getting dark.  The neighbors drove around me and up to the house to watch the news!  Can you believe that s***?  Drove right around me lying on the ground!  I could have died!‚Äù

I smiled.  It seemed hard to believe, but unbelievably bad things always happened to him.  Now he graced the nursing staff of the geriatric ward with his red faced, foul mouthed, screaming accusations.  More than once, they caught him rolling around in his wheel chair smoking weed in the hallways, while he pretended that the pictures on the wall were fine art.  When he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted from the staff, he messed himself and rolled up to the nurse‚Äôs station and demanded that they take care of it.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not dead, Bob.  I missed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúMissed you, too, Riley.  Missed you too.  How‚Äôs that piece of s***?  What‚Äôs his name?  Timmy?  Can‚Äôt stand that mother f***er.  When is he going to get where he can take care of himself?  I mean.  He‚Äôs only 38.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù  He was referring to my buddy who had been living at my house since before Bob came around.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he‚Äôs going to go.  I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll go for that matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?  Are you getting thrown out?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.  I decided to buy some coke last month while the rent money was in my pocket.  You know how it goes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.  Yeah, I do.  Haha.  F***ed yourself didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù  He showed his dentures with a smile.

‚ÄúYup.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I won‚Äôt be home for a while.  At least another month.  You can stay there and help me out when I get back home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome!  Thank you!‚Äù

‚ÄúJust one thing, Riley.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?  What‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave Tim wherever the f*** you found him in the first place.  The last thing I need or want is his sorry a** at my place.  Lousy piece of s***.‚Äù

I moved into his house a few days after Thad stabbed me in the face with an umbrella over a handful of Xanax that I stole from my friend‚Äôs leukemic landlord.  Despite all that I had going against me in terms of reputation and appearance in town, the black scabs on my face embarrassed me, because they made me look less than sophisticated.  Looking sophisticated was the least of my worries, and while Bob was in the hospital, my new friend Johnny and I tied my mattress to the hood of his car to move me and Tim and Tim‚Äôs dog into Bob‚Äôs new place.


Johnny and I used to tear through Taos in his white Lincoln Town Car with two other kids while I projectile vomited out of the passenger window.  Both of those kids are dead now.  One jumped from a cliff escaping imaginary and malevolent figures.  The other overdosed and got left in his car at the ER one night.  They found him dead in the morning.

Other times Johnny and I hung out with an older nurse who hated me until we shot cocaine together.  Then she stripped down and danced and sang for me while Johnny and I laughed at her.  She never noticed that I wasn‚Äôt into it, but that didn‚Äôt matter.  She was into herself.

It was common to watch her mix way too much cocaine with way too much heroine in the same shot, and ten minutes later she bragged about how she only ate granola because Fruity Pebbles were so unhealthy.  She told us about a house she had in Ranchos that was haunted with a patch of red paint that bled through multiple new coats over several years.  Eventually she had a dream in which all the details were disclosed about a 19th century abortion involving a teenage girl and a priest in that bedroom.  I tried to contact her about the story, but she‚Äôs dead too.


Bob ran Tim and his dog off as soon as he got home from the hospital and fell in a pile of his own feces soon after that.  He had gotten mad at me about not giving some syringes to Johnny in an episode of dementia and yelled for help all night long after he fell.  I let him sit in it until the morning, even though I couldn‚Äôt sleep for his yelling.  It was how heinous I had become.  He struggled to breathe for several days before we took him to the hospital, and it turned out that one of four broken ribs had punctured his lung.  He snuck his IV out of the hospital when they released him, but when he pulled it out at the house his blood was black saw dust.

Sometimes I had fits of furious passion in my bedroom and banged out reams of nonsense on my electric typewriter like a maniac firing a machine gun.  Sometimes I decided that the world was ending and that I would die soon.  Then there was no point in writing.  Sometimes I wouldn‚Äôt even get out of bed and chose instead to watch the squares of white sunlight slide slowly across the floor and up the wall until I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and had to get up to figure something out.  Sometimes I yelled at my dog from all the stress Bob caused me.  

I forgot that I even had a dog, until now, but I probably wouldn‚Äôt have told you about him anyway.  My career as a dog owner was a disgrace, and I thought if you hated me any more than you already do, you might stop reading.  Not that my neglect of the old man two paragraphs before this one shouldn‚Äôt make you hate me enough to stop reading, but these days people seem to value animal life more than human.  Let me tell you about my dog.  He was a good dog.   

It was Thad who brought him to my place after finding him in the KTAO parking lot some months earlier, and he was mostly heeler, what we called a Taos Cattle Dog.  We named him Serio, in part because he seemed serious and in part because Sirius is the dog star.  It fit well, and he understood me perfectly.  He would leave at eight in the morning and return at night.  He could sit, stay, lay down, get on the bed, get off the bed and anything else I asked him to do.  He never went to the bathroom in the house, except this time I screamed at him in my bedroom, and he pooped on my bed.  It was clearly intentional and made me laugh because I deserved it.  

When I moved from my old place to Bob‚Äôs, I overdosed on anxiety meds and left him outside of Smith‚Äôs grocery store.  It took me several days to realize that he was missing, and when I did, an empty leash tied to the railing at Smith‚Äôs was the only thing I found.  Serio showed up at Bob‚Äôs the next morning, even though he had never been there.  It was an amazing feat and endeared me to him more than ever.  

Now, I can‚Äôt remember if these last few paragraphs are about my dog or the electric typewriter my dad gave me.  Either way, they were both destined for doom like everything else I cared about.  My typewriter slid slowly off my bed even though I could have stopped it, but I was too depressed to move.  The impact shifted the keys, and it never worked again.  Serio was taken from me by another local drug addict, who was better than I was.  He accused me of neglecting the dog but shot him for killing one of his chickens a week later.  Such was my life and everything that I touched.  
   

  


‚ÄúEverything the warning labels on prescriptions say not to do, is everything you want to do!‚Äù  He laughed with his dentures out like he was channeling my old friend Bobo.  With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Buffalo Bob Cass and made crowds swoon.  Every time he died and went to heaven some ‚ÄúAbe Lincoln looking m***** f***er‚Äù sent him back saying he had to come in the front.  That he couldn‚Äôt come in the back door.

Once, he woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic.  His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag.  He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband.  The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall.  His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up.  A soothsayer in Woodstock told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives.  These were the stories that he told.

One day he watched Yolanda, Garth the dope whisperer‚Äôs girlfriend, open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor.  The lights were off and she supposed that he was gone, but he watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away.  She came for the flat screen.  Bob slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door.  That was Taos when I knew it.  Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn‚Äôt work out for them.  He sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took 300 dollars out of his account and never came back.  The year‚Äôs last snow had still not melted.  

When I was homeless the next summer I would end up at that desert oasis in Ranchos called Taco Bell.  Inside I would stare at the walls painted purple and red to make it look less cheap and listen to the soft jazz.  The dropouts working the counter understood the plight of life in Taos and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup.  I pondered life and what could have been and what was not.  Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town.  Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over chlorinated pool at the hotel.  I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late August.   Back to school commercials offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils on the hotel TVs.  Anxiety put knots in my stomach when they played, and I could feel it all, like I was there, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the 6th grade.  Then, I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson‚Äôs parking lot looking for a fix.

The last time Bob and I spent time together was right when he got out of the hospital again, a year later.  We had not talked for a long time, but I knew where he lived, and I knew he was in the hospital, so I moved in.  I was renting the front room out to Johnny and his junkie girlfriend who drooled on herself and always had 4 or 5 spoons on the kitchen counter with streaks of soot and the scattered pink crumbs of pills she called fast 5s.  One of her eyelids always stuck halfway shut, and she paused several seconds between every word.  They didn‚Äôt look very fast, but who was I to judge.

Bob was happy to see me anyway.  That was the life of a junkie, even at 75.  You go to the hospital.  You get out.  Junkies are living in your house, and the party goes on.  My girlfriend, Danielle, put the light bill in her name, because Bob owed money to the company, and he asked us to.   But when he made us mad one day I threw a big box TV at his feet and busted the white powder all over his floor.  Danielle and I went and turned the power off on the old man in the middle of winter to collect the deposit.  It was the last time that I ever saw him, but not the last I heard.

A year later, he called me from Miami where I suppose he died.  Years later in the foyer of a church, a woman asked me if I had a grandfather who passed.

‚ÄúHe wants to tell you hello.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean you talk to dead people?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy friends are passed over.‚Äù  She said, as if calling them dead was politically incorrect.

‚ÄúOh, well, I didn‚Äôt know my grandfather.  I don‚Äôt know who it could be.‚Äù

She struggled to get the deceased‚Äôs name, but could not come up with it.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know if he tells me his name.  He says he loves you.  He says you went through a lot together, and that you were in a bad way.  He said he is proud of you, for doing so well.  Very proud.‚Äù

She walked back over to her table, and I forgot about her.  My girlfriend and I talked at our table.  She said she thought contact with the dead was evil.  I had my own opinions of how that worked and explained.  The lady stood up suddenly and screamed,

‚ÄúBOB!!!!! He says his name is Bob!!!!!! He loves you and, he is so, so proud of you!‚Äù

Why you gotta die?
Used to be .. friends. 
I don‚Äôt know what we were.
But i‚Äôll never see you again.
I saw myself in your eyes.
You lied, sold drugs and held up gang signs.

Last time I saw you, on instagram holding your girl tight.
For the first time, you were happy.

For the last time.

And then it all gets taken away,
Like that.
Overdose. Death. 
Why do you have to do that?
Break my heart like that?
I warned my friends to stay away from you.
I only knew you because I sold to you, 
Because I bought from you.

And now it's like this.

I can‚Äôt stop crying.

I shouldn‚Äôt care so much but I do,

Fuck you.

I could have helped. 
I shouldn‚Äôt have sold that shit to you.
Why the fuck did you live in the fast lane?
I hate you, you stupid fucking kid. 
I wish we could have been friends, 
Talked you out of doing the hard shit.

Now you‚Äôre in the ground, 

History erased because you lived as a shame to society.

You had potential.
That should have been me, could have been.

I miss you man, I never thought I would.

That ain‚Äôt fair, you making me feel like this. 

I pray for you, that wherever you are, it‚Äôs not hell.
It's tough luck, how you ended up..
You made your bed, I hope you sleep soundly in it.
I mean that sincerely. You deserve some rest. 

Keep the party going for me,

I‚Äôll be over soon.

Jesus time is going slow...,"Got clean about 2 weeks ago. No more withdrawals, no subs, no antidepressants, benzos, addys, nothing. It's interesting being totally sober. Boring, but it's nice to not be sick and shit.

Anyways, after being unemployed for a year due to getting to the stage in the junkie spiral where you lose your job, everything, and scam/steal to get your fix, I finally said fuck it and got a job. Relocated a state over for this.

Now I'll be getting my first paycheck this coming Friday. I'll have so much money. I'm going to be driving home to visit my family and girl I use with that Friday night. Will be there in WI for the weekend where all my awesome dboys are. Gonna get a gram right away, probably a couple halfs from a couple other guys to see who has the best stuff at the moment, and get another gram or so from that person.

But FUCK if this is impossible for me to wait. The last week felt so long. Now we have one more week to go. I'm so fucking excited. But I have to wait until next Friday. I'm going to be physically shaking with excitement on my 5 hour drive home that night.

How do you guys handle this kinda shit? Such as waiting for your check to come in a few days, waiting for the direct deposit to go through, waiting for a mail delivery of boy, or you're chipping and finding out for whatever reason you have to wait like one week to use again.

I'm wondering if anyone can give me a trick they use to calm down and be patient. God, even when I get to Wednesday, I'll still have to get through a full day of work on Thursday, and then Friday before I can leave Friday night!

Just ranting. Fuck. The scars on my wrists and hands are such fucking triggers. I wish I could put a needle in there right now.",1508044291.0

I've been around the drug block a bit but was more of a upper guy, but recently acquired some #4 heroin (which is apparently very pure but I have no way of actually knowing this). I've been doing my research and still have a few questions.

First off I have a real low tolerance, and plan on the start small approach. Dosing no more then match head size bump (ROA snorted), setting a timer waiting 15 minutes then if I feel the need redose get after that.

My question are will even such a small amount potential make me vomit? Also I'm not looking to nod right off more just get a nice buzz going. And will I be able to sleep with the drug in my system? I have a few Xanax on hand for when I'm in need of sleep while stimming but I've read the mixing two depressants can be very dangerous and stop you from breathing (I'm fairly experienced with Xanax).

I know there is a few people that are going to say don't do it , or to flush it, but honestly I'm going to do it anyway I'm just looking for advice on how to be safe. I only have .3 of a gram and do not have a steady supply at all.

Edit: So thanks for everyone's comments. Definitely got a taste of what H has to offer last night. Starting small and working my way up I took 3 bumps all totalling the size of a match head in about 1hr ish. Was feeling different but getting none of the effects I've read about. I decided to go for one more bigger bump about little over half of my total initial dose, it's then that the shit really started to hit me. Typing and moving was really hard. My eyes where very heavy, and I knew my feet and hands where cold but I didn't feel cold.

The itch was crazy and I refrained from scratching when I could but when I did it felt so good. I got up to go to bed and was pretty wobbly. Sleep did not come easy, but in the sane sense my bed was the most comfortable thing in the world it felt amazing. Yet I still had trouble sleeping. I'm still a bit itchy and doses out this morning but all in all my experience was a good one.",1508040548.0

Can it work in reverse? I know you can have it by taking Suboxone too soon after heroin, but what if you take heroin too soon after Suboxone?

I took Suboxone early in the morning then did heroin at night and barely felt it. Now I feel horrible! Heart racing massive sweats. Am I somehow having precipiated withdrawal? Because I thought it happened only when you take Suboxone after heroin...

Can I take Suboxone now to fight this feeling?

By the way, I'm also addicted to Suboxone, so I was already sick from the Subs, but now it's far worse after taking dope. Now I'm and afraid to take subs because I just took a lot of heroin (even though I barely felt it). Can I safely take Suboxone or will that make it worse because of the heroin I've injected that I barely felt and shot it 20 minutes ago?

EDIT: 20 min later from this post I'm experiencing a massive head-ache! This happened before, I've had this when I've taken subs right after heroin (first time I've experience precipitated withdrawal), but I didn't think you could get with the other way around... can someone elaborate if you're familiar? I found 250mg of phenibut laying around and I'm hoping that helps, but this is intense!

EDIT 30 min later: I'm now thinking it's cotton fever. I just took 250mg of phenibut and I'm wondering if that's a dangerous combination? I can't tell if I'm feeling the heroin, but cotton fever is probably masking it... not sure.

Then he proceeds to apologize and said  he'd be back in a half hour and he'll trade whatever I want and throw in another one for free for the troubles.  I tell him one isn't bad but I would like to trade back 4.

76rbm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76rbm8/on_evolving_truth_and_assurances/,6,https://redd.it/76rbm8,sloan_fitch,On evolving truth and assurances..,"Earlier in the week, like last Tuesday my friend assured me that he would buy subs on Friday and that we simply had to focus on getting dope on Wednesday.

Come Thursday, I remind him. He assures me no matter what, I will not be going to work sick. So although he does not get subs on Friday, he gives me something to take before work. 

&nbsp;

To get the subs, my friend had to get through someone nearby but through his sister. So on Friday my friend indicates he's been in contact with his sister and spits out specific times. ""Louanne the sub connect is available after 3 bc she picks kids up from school."" Once 3pm rolls around on Friday this doesn't happen. 

That night I went to his sister to see if my friend has really been in contact with her. She had no idea what I was talking about, kindly expressed regret over her brother getting me into ""the game"" and said she'd be happy to help me get subs. 

Come Saturday, I text my friend from work and he says ""I'm working on it."" He also indicated he has been in contact with his sister but this is not true.

&nbsp;

I should be pissed at my friend, I mean like I am but I played it cool just because anger and backing an a scared animal into a corner isn't going to make anything better.

The dboy who has owed me two subs for over a week and a half texted me Saturday night. Voula! I received two subs. If I wasn't sitting with my lying friend, I would've probably kept both of them to myself but he ended up getting one. Sort of right because he did keep me well for work the day before. 

&nbsp; 

So it turns out that my lying friend at least sent around a few text messages including one to the dboy who owed me subs for over a week. ""sloan_fitch is going to be mad sick tomorrow and he has work all day."" That may have helped move the wheels of progress in a forward direction. 

&nbsp;

At the time my friend was lying about being in contact with the sub connect, I think he was lying about having $35 on him as well. Earlier in the week he tried a new dboy with better shit. He ordered eight buns. The motherfucker was like, ""you get the money from the ATM at 5am, and I'll drive to the state nearby and be back by 7."" He came back around 7 but only had 2 buns. Days later, many phone calls and my friend still didn't get his dope. He had to get a little more dope from his old dboy. Probably spent the money that was supposed to be spent on subs.

&nbsp;

The bad dboy left a bag of electronics and weed with my friend's sister so he commandeered it as collateral hoping he doesn't actually have to sell any of it. In his mumbling benzo-opioid stupor my friend got off the phone with a friend who he was trying to sell a quarter to for about a $100. 

I say it's a quarter, he says it's a half but he can't find the scale that he misplaced to confirm it. My friend's only viable hustle at this time is to sell the weed he obtained and he's failing at it. Apparently he was counting on this hustle to get a couple of buns and maybe a couple of subs tho I'm pretty sure he would shortsightedly prioritize dope over subs.

&nbsp;

It was my friend's turn to buy this week and now I owe him three buns which I'll happily pay for on pay day. I don't think I enjoy this game and the bullshit much anymore... I should taper down to zero but I'd like to stock up on subs as a security net. I plan to go to his sister on pay day to get subs and keep my friend out of the loop on that. He obviously isn't that interested in getting subs anyway.


I'm about to get my medical insurance activated so that I can pursue a sub doctor or a Psychiatrist. Truth be told, my DOC is adderall. My friend used to be able to get it for me on occasion but he had a falling out with the connect. Back when I wasn't too into opioids but was ready to put good money into stims I offered dope instead. I remember this one time he thought I texted the adderall connect and got concerned really fast -- immediately turned red. Something happened there and it was obvious my friend was not in contact with the adderall guy anymore even though he said he was.

&nbsp;

Notes:

* My friend has gotta stop pre-paying for dope.

* The old dboy's most recent batch was really big. Previously he was skimming from the bags but my friend seeking competition changed this for a day.

* My friend lied about being in contact with his sister who is friends with the sub connect.

* His text message to the guy who owed me subs may have helped my situation.

* I'm gonna be late for work if I keep typing, like that other day when I went to pick up dope but had to bike 3 miles away to wait 10 minutes. The 10 minutes turned into 30 while I was stressing that I need to be on time for work. Never again do I plan on putting myself into a such a vulnerable position.",1508168597.0

I simply cannot, idk exactly why i'm a junkie but I simply cannot cope with reality without being loaded on an opiate. The opiate game is the most fucked up vile thing I've ever had the curse of dealing with. I've ODed 8 times, and I still can't stop, fellow junkies drop everyday up here in the tri state area. 

So I was going on my monthly stimulant binge when my one buddy gets a phone call, I can tell something is horribly wrong. We had both slammed a dose of methamphetamine that really honestly nobody should do. He begins crying and tells me that his best friend overdosed. I barely met this guy but he ODed on opana and I've only seen him a handful of times. So homie begins hysterically crying in the middle of a gas station, all I can do is say ""i'm so fucking sorry if theres anything I can do im here for you bro"". Heroin is both of our DoC he is currently in a halfway house and i'm a terrible excuse for something that is actually alive. We both struggle with similar problems, junkie problems, the kind of problems only we will ever understand. So of course the next sentence out of my mouth was, ""come on bro do you want me to fix you a fat shot?"" I know shit doesn't make any sort of sense but most of us here know how effective that opiates are at taking away pain, any sort of pain, even the worst kind of pain. 

So I had to go drop dope off all day for my boy and deal with the worst junkies. I know addicts die and shit but a week before this my ex girlfriend ODed. I'm sure you can imagine how dysfunctional of a relationship we have but she is the love of my life. We're not together currently and to be honest I don't think she should be around me at all. I can be honest with you guys here, i'm a miserable fuck, energy drain most of the time. My heroin use was one of many contributing factors on why our relationship is currently in ruins.

We both used opiates but apparently I can't deal with emotions like normal people. I don't like people, most people, I can count the number of my close friends on one hand; I tell myself its by choice but i'm just a hateful fuck. But these two people, I care a great deal about. 

She came back to town last week, I don't want to ruin her life with my lifestyle that is dominated by me running away from my thoughts; but i'm too selfish the right thing would have been to not see her. She has been with me for all my shit, and I never deserved any of it, I was the first one to shoot her up. 

Guess who caught who slamming a shot in the bathroom..she ask for one and there is nothing I enjoy more then IVing a heroin and laying with a woman, especially a woman of this caliber. I can't resist, I normally fix her shots but I apparently wanted to get loaded this particular morning. I do her after I get mine because if Im not high I begin to feel things and good god thats awful right, I suppose she got tired of waiting on me and fixed hers while I was in a nod. 

She fell out, i've been an IV addict for 5 years now, seen many OD, copped in the filithest places the US has to offer. (shoutout to Bmore yall got that scramble and the finest rock the US has to offer bless). I cant get her face out of my head. 

The death snore started quick, unresponsiveness. Shes fucking with me right? 1 breath every 15 seconds...nah this is weird, breathing gets more and more repressed and any experienced junkie would know they are about to check out. I breathed for her for 15 mins, CPR, and its been 4 days or 5 idk I don't know how to cope with this.

You would think I would want to stop shooting right..? I do but what do you do when you are paralyzed with constant emotional pain? I feel as if i'm at a point that I caused the people I love the most around me so much pain that being in my presence is a terrible thing. Shit is so unfair. I banged up right when the cops left and she was on the way to the hospital..then I banged up in the car...and yes, what else can you do but bang a fatty in the bathroom of a hospital that your at because of that same drug just killed the only solace you have. I fucking hate this shit, fuck heroin, and fuck opiates.

The first few times she took care of me, now this cunt demands all my time. Opiates took away everything that I love. Its all I care about, and shes a bitch yo, last week I didn't see her for a whole 6 hours and guess what the cunt did? Made me so ill I was forced to fuck her again. 

This isn't fun anymore...I want to stop, I want good people to stop dying, I know lifes not fair but whoever can cope with daily life and not use opiates is an amazement to me. I'm disgusted every time I shoot up but it controls everything I do...

I'm unemployed, homeless, my bank account is negative, most of my friends hate me, when i'm around my family they are so concerned that I haven't seen most of them in quite some time. I miss the people I used to have time for. I let Heroin take away the only thing that I have ever cared about in my entire, unproductive life. 

She's one of the best fucks ever, but its the only pussy you'll get for the rest of your life, she'll make sure of it. 

Well look at that methamphetamine fueled rant, I should start working out, yeah..tomorrow. I'm at the end right I just want this shit to be over..i'm exhausted...

Well, I have a gram of hard left and a ball of boy...i'm going to sell the boy though so I can pay rent, right? Yeah...No. As always thanks for letting me vent; this board and the users have gotten me through some of the hardest parts of my life. 

I need to go into town and get lit cause I don't know what else to do.

Shoutout to Tracy and all the folks that managed to get clean, I look at you people with awe. Thanks for the junkies I can shoot the shit with anytime. 

Give every addict you know narcan, don't use alone, don't mix opiates and benzos, and for fucks sake get a fent test strip...they are two dollars on ebay. If you can afford that bun that you can afford to potentially save your life. Even those who don't feel like they are, your loved, by somebody.

I do all of them in a day, my girlfriend gets mad that it basically makes me unable to get up or cum, and it doesn't get me high anymore like it used to.

Last year was amazing when I started doing oral hydro. 20-30mg had me feeling so good. But then oxy and then snorting and now I'm waiting so much money it's ridiculous.

I can't anymore.fuk this shit. Fuk downgrading to a weaker opiate, fuk doing kratom.

Im sick of this shit.

I want my normal life back where I have to put in work to feel good. Tired of being lazy and eating Junk food because it's so nice on blues. Tired of not giving a fuk about doing my work and missing out on like $7000 in the past 16 days because whatever I'll do the max 1 hour of work tomorrow.

Hate that I'm so far behind on my life, to do list, and days sober.

Finished my last blue about 90 minutes ago and I don't feel it much. And even if I do id rather not.

I'm not even gonna think about this as difficult or think how hard it will be. I'm over this shit so I don't see withdrawals or cravings even hitting or affecting me. Fuk this bs. It's also highly expensive but even if I had a years supply of blues now I'd sell it probably. Doing it is poibtkess now.

I'd like to ask every reddit redditor for support and blessing. I'd also like to ask every redditor how and why they started opiates and why they continued using and why they continue using today and what their drug is now and the amount they use. We all started somewhere. Though I started with tramadol 7 years ago I really was on and off long long breaks lasting years. Only last year did I come back from vacation and I missed everyone so at that time even hydro literally 10-20mg made everything feel so good. All the problems melted away and I felt like I had a small sun in my chest shining and I felt so good and everyone loved my energy.

Now I just feel like it takes only my money and wastes my time and mental capacity. I don't hit the gym or eat healthy as much anymore and can't even cum even when my girl is blowing me. I hate that.

The weird part is is that it hurts right above the shot too, right on my bicep and it feels tight when straighten my arm. I've left it alone and it seems to be getting a little better.

TLDR - oxy in Coke, poss to let it sit too long? 

Is it possible to let the oxy sit too long in the Coke? Is there any downside to it?

I just set up 120mg oxy ER in Coke to soak. Not planning on taking it til I get home from work around 8:30 (20 hours)

Any downside to this? Does it breakdown too much or does it affect it in anyway? Or is longer better no matter how long?

I typically do 12 hours and it works great. Wondering how 20 would work.

Thanks guys! These gotta hold me over. Pain in the ass but better than a CWE I guess, haha

We met him in a White Castle parking lot, and before he met us, we saw him serve someone else. We were so excited from finding a connect in our neighborhood, as we usually have to go far. The pills looked legit. I took my full 10 while my friend chewed up 5 mgs. He said he tasted something funny, but dismissed it. We went back to my place to smoke with a group of friends.

It originated in 19th century Asia, but a vein of revival made its way up from Mexico in the early nineteen nineties.  Upon conversion, we sold all we had to follow our goddess.  We lived for her, and in back alleys and hotel rooms all around the city, we built altars to her with blackened spoons, the bottom halves of aluminum cans, needles, empty cigarette boxes and lighters.  We practiced the ritual of cooking magical potions, conjuring up blissful sleep and vapor the smell of vinegar and brown sugar.  We vomited and hiccupped as a rite of passage.  Daily devotions involved tying ourselves off, kneeling before her altar and letting blood from our arms.  We were ready to sacrifice our first born if she asked.
------------------
Heroin was life for us, and without her we were dead.  Every heartbeat.  Every thought.  Every move.  Every drop of gasoline in the car.  Every cent we made.  Every calorie we consumed.  Every breath was devoted to the chase for more.
-------------------




Four Hondurans started selling heroin and cocaine at five in the morning.  They came like clockwork, because they got off the first bus that brought them to the park.  Besides Chivo, it was the only other place we knew to get heroin in town, and it was the only place it was available at five a.m.  Chivo started at eight, but sickness started early.  They sold dimes, or ten dollars‚Äô worth, in tightly wrapped balls made from cut squares of trash bag.  Black was heroine.  White was cocaine.  They sold five for 40 dollars as an incentive to buyers and allowed any combination.

We woke up before five, sick as usual.  I gathered together the random CDs in the car and went to see if one of the Hondurans in the park would trade a dime of black for them.  Roger was the one we knew best, but he laughed at my offer.  He seemed annoyed.  He would not even look at me.

We were out of luck, so we parked next to a Seven Eleven.  In the car, we stretched and yawned.  Our bodies ached, and the anxiety set in.  We never knew where we would get it.  We just had to have it.  Watery snot and tears started, the sure signs of dope sickness.

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do, bubby?‚Äù  Danielle lay back in the passenger seat.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, baby.  I‚Äôm tired.  We can call Chivo and ask for another front, or we can do something, but it‚Äôs too early to call Chivo.  Let me chill for a minute.  We‚Äôll get it.  Don‚Äôt worry. I don‚Äôt know how but we will.‚Äù  She always said she liked me better when I was sick.  Heroine made me extremely mean and difficult.  When I was sick, I felt exposed and sensitive.  Television commercials brought tears to my eyes, and I was nice to her.

‚ÄúOK, bubby.  I‚Äôm sick as s***.‚Äù  She held her stomach.

‚ÄúI know, baby.  Me too.‚Äù  I folded my arms and closed my eyes.  My back and head ached.  I pushed back into the driver‚Äôs seat.  Not two minutes passed before we heard a knock on the window.

A strange individual tried to talk to us through the closed window.  Thick glasses, a shaved head, orange freckles on pale skin, a gaunt face.  Maybe a man.  Maybe a lesbian.  I tried to tell the person to wait till we rolled the window down, but they continued to talk.  As the window lowered, I could hear he was a man.

‚ÄúI need a ride out of here!  Right now!  I‚Äôve got money!  I‚Äôll pay you.  I have to get out of this state!‚Äù  He seemed genuinely desperate for our help.  Through the window he flashed several bills, mostly ones and a five.  It was good enough for me.

‚ÄúGet in!‚Äù

Danielle had to open her door to open the door for him to crawl into the back, and we took off.

‚ÄúWhere do you want to go?‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt know where he went.  There was nothing in the back seat, but a pile of clothes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know!  Anywhere, out of here!‚Äù  His voice came from the clothes.  He had buried himself in the pile of unfolded and dirty clothes.

‚ÄúWell, maybe you could give us a little more direction.  If you pay, we‚Äôll take you anywhere you want.‚Äù  I remembered the condition of my release from jail.  My travels were not to exceed a 150-mile radius from there, but money was on the line.  He never gave us a destination.  



Traffic halted for miles on the interstate.  It was from people headed to work, so we were stuck for a while.  He talked about the people chasing him.  They wanted to kill him, and the cops would send him to prison.  He had spent the previous night jumping fences to escape.  A day or two before that, he threw away several ounces in a hotel room of the casino, because he thought he was being set up.  Danielle and I knew what he needed.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let us get you some heroin?  That‚Äôll calm you down.  We can get a hotel room and get some brown.  Hey, what‚Äôs your name anyway?  If we are going to be helping you escape and partners in crime, we should know each other‚Äôs names.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Carl.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Riley.  This is Danielle.‚Äù

He agreed that getting heroin was a good idea, so we pulled off at the next exit, and called Chivo.  We found a Motel 6, and she checked into the room, for us.  He snuck in while we waited for Chivo.  We never had much money to score, so Chivo‚Äôs driver hurried to meet us at the gas station down the street.  Out of the four 50-dollar balloons, Carl gave us three to share, which he did several more times.  He always gave us three and kept one.  It was Christmas morning, and we were little kids.

When Danielle and I got high, we bickered and said nasty things to one another, not as a matter of any real hurt or problems we had, but like an allergic reaction to the heroin.  There were two or three days in a row of us sitting in a dark, cool Motel 6 room watching HBO high on heroin and Danielle and I squabbling.  Carl spent time on his computer and whined about our fussing and fighting.

‚ÄúYou guys should love one another.  You never know when you won‚Äôt have the other one with you again.‚Äù  He whimpered.  His life was hard, one of six boys, the youngest, and regularly raped by one of his brothers.  His father hated him.  He found love with an old man named Tony, who taught him the trade of stealing fine art, paintings and such.  They were busted together and sent to different prisons where Tony died of AIDS, I guessed.  Danielle and I thought Carl turned tricks off the Internet for the money he had, but we had no proof.  On our third day together, he had us drop him off in the middle of nowhere, because he did not want to hear us fight.  His countenance was quiet and depressed, and he wouldn‚Äôt make eye contact.

Danielle and I came back from trying to score all day at around 630 to find Carl outside of the room waiting for us.  He got four balloons as usual, but this time he only gave us one and kept three.  Then he gave us 20 bucks and sent us to Wendy‚Äôs to get some dinner.

Carl lay on the floor sweaty and flaccid by the time we got back to the room.  A few slaps to the face and yells of his name proved he had overdosed.  Danielle shrieked and flapped her hands at her face in fear, while I ran to the bathroom and saturated a hand towel with water.  When I rung it out over his face and the water hit him he came to.

‚ÄúHey, mother f***er, we‚Äôre calling 911!  You need to go to the hospital!‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt take his attempt at suicide personally.  It was his prerogative far as I saw it, but overdosing himself in the hotel room where we slept was unacceptable.

‚ÄúNo!  No! No!  Don‚Äôt call the ambulance.  I‚Äôm okay.  I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù  He begged us not to call.  I listened to him, for some reason.  Soon after all of it, I regretted not robbing him for all his money and sending him overdosed to the hospital.  We would have been gone with his electronics and money before he got out of the hospital.

We feared that he would asphyxiate, so we made him sit up against the corner of the room on his bed while we watched TV.  The blankets were around him, and she and I must have given cues that I was nodding out with our conversation.  His eyes were closed, but he was awake.

‚ÄúSee?  Riley is nodding out.  Why doesn‚Äôt he have to go to the hospital?‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f*** up, Carl.  Or we will call 911 to come get your overdosing a**.‚Äù  It was 1030.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not fair.  You are as high as I am.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut the f*** up, Carl!‚Äù

He was snoring at 130 when I went to sleep.  The Hangover played mute on the TV.  Danielle woke me up at 10.

‚ÄúRiley.  Riley.  Wake up.  I think he‚Äôs dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not dead.‚Äù  I opened my eyes and looked at him.  I was not so sure.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs dead, bubby!  He looks dead!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.  He‚Äôs not dead.  Let‚Äôs find a rinse before we check.‚Äù

We found the bottom half of a coke can on a shelf below the TV.  It had a spot of brown goo on the edge with a gray, shriveled cotton in the middle.  It was all that was left of the three balloons he did the day before.  I wondered how he even managed to get that much tar into a syringe and inject it while we were at Wendy‚Äôs.  I thought he must have skin-popped it.  It would have been several injections of black sludge, and if he had hit a vein the first one would have put him out.

We washed the bottom of the coke can with water and even sucked it through his old cotton.  It was not the clean thing to do, but we didn‚Äôt care.  She peed on the toilet and kept telling me he was dead while I split the syringes of slightly colored water.  I denied it one more time before I hit a vein in her arm and then my own.

I walked out first and went over to his bed.  I focused on his mouth and the strand of drool hanging from his chin.  It was dried out and stuck there, the consistency of hair sprayed spider web.  When I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake, I said, ‚ÄúCarl!‚Äù  But he rolled over, cold and stiff.  His legs never unfolded or changed position.  The dried-out stalactite of drool stood upside down in the air, and his head hung off the bed.  His eyes belonged on ice at the super market.  They may as well have been a pair of yellow, lumpy grapes for all the life that they had in them.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs dead.‚Äù  Danielle cried.  I pulled him off the bed onto the floor.  It only took a second for me to consider what money he might have on him and reached into the pocket of his shorts to find a black leather wallet.  There were 250 dollars, so I took the two big bills and left the 50.

Danielle called 911 like we should have the night before.  She said the operator said to give him mouth to mouth.  One look at his dead mouth and the thought of the stale air trapped in his lungs settled it in my mind that I was not giving him mouth to mouth.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving him mouth to mouth!‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, Riley!  Just try!  Is he cold?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot cold, but he‚Äôs not warm.  If you want to give him mouth to mouth get over here and do it.  Or they can come do it, but I AM NOT doing it!‚Äù

She talked into the phone.  ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not completely cold.  Is that a good thing?  Is there a chance he might live?‚Äù  She asked in tears and then turned to me.  ‚ÄúShe says to put your mouth on his mouth and breath.‚Äù

‚ÄúHang up!‚Äù

We gathered the syringes and cookers and balloons and threw the in the dumpster at the back of the parking lot.  We stepped outside as the fire truck pulled up.  They quickly gave up on trying to resuscitate Carl‚Äôs dead body.  One squad car pulled up, then another, and one more.  A cop put up the yellow tape around the room, and they separated Danielle and me, to question us.  She spoke so I could hear her, to get our stories to match up.  The black cop dressed in blues flirted with her.  She flirted back and told him she was a stripper.  As I wrote a statement on the hot hood of a running squad car in the sun, I wondered how many years I could get for it.  Would these be my last minutes of freedom scribbling and nervous on the hood of a cop car?

An unmarked car pulled up with two detectives.  They wore jackets, slacks and ties and had personality.  They slicked their black hair back true to their Hispanic heritage.  One of them talked to me about the Hornets and mentioned the Nuggets.  Sickly scents of pomade and cologne mixed with fear to turn my stomach.  His partner walked around and talked to the policemen before he walked up to me.

‚ÄúLook.  We got an overdose to go to right after this, two blocks away.  Another dead body.  We don‚Äôt have time for all of this.  Where are the syringes and cookers?  You don‚Äôt think he overdosed on air, do you? No.  We don‚Äôt either.  Now, we understand, you and your girlfriend got scared and hid all the stuff.  But we need some evidence of his drug use.  We need some syringes for evidence, and we‚Äôll get you two on your way.  I promise.‚Äù

They took me to the dumpster where we tossed the stuff, and made me climb in, but I couldn‚Äôt find it.  There were several empty 20 oz. bottles from another room with syringes in them.  We never put our syringes in bottles like that, but the detective seemed satisfied.

‚ÄúOK.  Grab a few and give them to me.‚Äù

They took some pictures and got our written statements.  Things wrapped up, and the coroner came.  A hearse came to pick up the body.  It was obvious that one of the two men working for the company with the hearse enjoyed his job, maybe too much.  He had a black three-piece suit and a felt top hat on, with a gold chain to a watch in his breast pocket. He wore a monocle. I didn‚Äôt know hearses picked up overdosed bodies out of hotel rooms, but that‚Äôs what I saw that day.

When they finally took the yellow police tape down and released us from the scene, she jumped into my arms and wrapped her legs around my waist.  We shouted in glee and relief and made out in front of the last two cops on the scene.  It was over, and we were free.  I still had the 200 hundred dollars.

The first thing we did was call Chivo and met one of his guys at a gas station.  When his driver showed up, I told him what happened.  It didn‚Äôt really matter to him.  They wanted the money.  At some point in the day, I spilled the last of our heroin out of a cooker onto my khaki pants.  She was mad, so we went to Home Depot.  I tried to steal a bunch of copper wire, but on the way out of the door, loss prevention drove me to the ground so hard the scab on my knee had fabric from my pants in it and turned it green.  Lock up smelled better than the last one, and they let me out after three days for petit theft.

A week later, the coroner called to ask what I knew about Carl.  I told him what Carl told me, maybe it was true, maybe not, but it‚Äôs what he said.  His tone of voice seemed bewildered over the phone.  Sometime after that, on our way to Danielle‚Äôs first night stripping again, a strange figure riding a scooter pulled up next to us.  Danielle and I looked over at a 55-year-old lesbian in a black leather cap and vest, thick glasses, orang freckles and pale face.  Her hair was red and grey and buzzed off.  Could it be Carl? It looked exactly like him.  We laughed about when the 911 operator had instructed us to give him mouth to mouth.  

I never felt much about robbing the dead man, or the fact that the last words he heard before he died were me telling him to, ‚Äúshut the f*** up.‚Äù  There was no time to feel bad about it, when spilled hits of heroin and three days in jail were so disappointing.  The only thing I ever thought about it was that I should have robbed him when he was overdosed and called the paramedics.  It would have been less trouble for us.

Please reach out to me if you see this, I know of literally hundreds of very effective ways of helping with depression. I CAN HELP YOU. 

OP, two weeks ago I was thinking of all the ways to end my life, and starting friday I had one of the most incredible weekends of my life and kept telling myself I'll never consider suicide again. Today went to work and realized how insanely happy I am to have the job I have despite making barely above minimum wage, I realized how insanely lucky I am as of late to have the family and friends I have even though two weeks ago I thought my family was clueless and careless and that I had no friends.

OP, whoever you are and whatever you've been through in this elegant, vicious, beautifully fucked up, amazingly awesome, anxiety provoking, incredible world, I can relate and so can so many people on here. Don't give in to the intrusive thoughts, it's not you, it's the depression. Life is beautiful and an adventure worth living out to the end.

Do NOT end your life.

My parents granted me with the perfect storm of mental illness combined with addictive tendencies. Alcoholics and drug addicts everywhere throughout both of my parents families, and a suspiciously similar amount of people dealing with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, deficits of all kinds. You could say I was doomed from the start in a way. But having lived with this twisted lens to look at life through, it's forced me to realize why I care so much for other people, why I feel like I'm so much more emotional, overly-sensitive and sympathetic towards other's struggles and faults. Pain and suffering makes you stronger and in the end, happier. Because the darkest moments are always before the dawn. I've shot up, snorted, swallowed, and smoked quite literally almost every notable substance this world has to offer. I've gone through every method of suicide my brain could possibly muster up while putting everyone it could affect on the backburner, so I could feel that tiny high that the thought of suicide brings.

I know what it's like to long for the end. To feel at peace just at the potential for this seemingly endless suffering to finally be over.

But I've also spent time at the opposite end of that spectrum. Thinking about how insane I was to have ever considered taking my own life. It always comes back around, and every damn time I'm so fucking glad I stayed to enjoy the next dive on the rollercoaster, because it's so damn fun. Life is so damn fun. It's so wonderful and also... not. But the reason it'll ever feel wonderful is BECAUSE sometimes it's just... not. Sometimes it might feel that way for longer than we wish, but OP, it will always, always, ALWAYS be worth it to never pull that trigger, tie that knot, or push down the plunger on that golden shot.

Talk to us, talk to me, anybody you can. Don't do anything to harm yourself. It's worth it, coming from somebody who knows. Life is worth it.",1508233789.0

Yeah, well, I'm the opposite. Thirty-four going on twenty-one: c'est moi. 

You ever get that feeling that when you started down this road, it kind of put a cap on your development? Like, no boy, no, you're not gonna mature; you're not gonna grow; you're not gonna get that partner, that mortgage, that great career, that kid; you're gonna be twenty-one for the rest of your life because guess what? This shit will prevent you from accessing any of that stuff. 

I feel....*older*. But do I feel wiser? More mature? I feel more knowledgable, maybe. But what's knowledge without the conversion of information into wisdom? I *know* that this is bad for me. I *know* that lying and stealing is wrong. But I don't have the maturity to convert that information into the wisdom that would prevent me from using, from lying, from cheating, from stealing. 

I've got a degree in a worthwhile subject. I've got a Masters degree that is 100% relevant to the job I do - the job I do *well*. Is it the job I want? Honestly? I have no idea. I get satisfaction from it. I help people. I educate them. But I feel like a fucking fraud because most of the time I'm there I'm either high or in withdrawal, making my mood so in flux that often my colleagues are amazed at how changeable I can be from one day to the next: soft, affirming, and generous; hard, cruel, and dismissive. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Thirty-four going on twenty-one?

Long lurker here, and occasional poster. Anyway let me get down to brass tax. If anyone knows me, and have seen my previous posts, I was a very heavy user  the past 4 years before around this time last year. Started with oxy, graduated to boy quickly, and went into a quick tailspin. 

About 11 months and 2 weeks ago, I was arrested in a very strict county after an OD. Spent 229 days in county because of it, but don't regret the time at all. In county I got into NA, and continued with the fellowship once I was released.

Well in my home group, I kicked it off with a fellow recovering addict. Her story was a lot different than mine. Legit pain management for knee and back surgeries when she was younger. Few years on oxy before she decided she wanted to get clean, mainly for her enlarged heart issues and daughter. I know she was on methadone for a moment, before switching to subs. 

When I met her she was off done and starting a sub program. Well due to lack of insurance and funds, she needed to stop the sub program. I was surprised
I don't known what to do. I love this woman more anything, and dont want to ask when she did, because she didn't display serious WD's, like none.

She also takes citalopram for anxiety, however, hanging out tonight, soon as she came over, I could tell something was up. Really slow slurred speech, irritability, nods, and just generally closed off.

Since we've been seeing each other, we have been very honest with each other and ourselves. She's introduced me to her beautiful daughter shared her deepest feelings with me, and her passed used and attempt at sobriety. Just hit 3 months clean, but I dunno if that will hold. Well today being The caring (nosey) bf in am, decided to go through her purse.  Find 10mg methadone tabs, alprolozam and some.other stuff I didn't identify 

I don't know what to do fam. Idon't want to leave here but I know my sobriety come first. Any suggestions?

It's killing me, I'm an addict, I can spot pinned eyes and other side effects from miles away, but she just don't open up and tell me. Help.

TLDR: found methadone hydrochloride and alprolozam in my gfs purse, worried about her health, don't know how to open up dialogs about it, can't lose her.

 I'm the guy that posted about my septic hip and going into surgery the other day. The surgery went well, but it turns out it was unnecessary as the infection wasn't located there. Just my luck. They don't give a shit about how undermedicated I am, but I figured I had an end-around that. I worked some junkie magic and procured some cash... I had a long time friend who went through some similar stuff while we were dating, and I totally made sure she had adequate pain relief while she was in the hospital.

 I figured between .75 and the hospital dope I'd be able to make it through the worst of this. Unexpectedly, she brought me maybe a quarter gram and a few bucks in change. I was really upset, but it kept my pain manageable for a night and part of a day. It breaks my heart that she could be so cold to me while I suffer. I know y'all probably think I'm exaggerating, but this is the most pain I've ever experienced. The hour and a half gap where the pain meds are literally not doing shit are the worst and slowest clock-ticks of my life. 

 I genuinely wish I could die. If I could press a button and never wake up, I wouldn't fucking hesitate. This is the most fucked up thing someone has ever done to me. There's more, but I know this is a wall of text.

I've taken suboxone countless times but never without a tolerance. I'm used to getting just well off of it. Now I've been free of opiate dependence for months even though I've used heroin on an occasional basis. 


I gotta say the high came on really slow, I just took the sublingual route, and I think the naloxone kinda blocks the effect at first, but then it wears off quickly while the buprenorphine lasts forever. I took half a 8mg tab. When I was hooked, I took one of those each day just to feel well. Now it's been 2 hours and 30 minutes since I took it and I feel the effect is just starting to peak. 


I gotta say without a tolerance suboxone is pretty nice. You gotta take it for what it is, a weaker, longer acting opiate designed specifically for maintainence of heavier opiate use. But without a tolerance, it still hits pretty hard. What I never noticed before is that the naloxone seems to indeed slow the onset of the effect. When I took before I could never really feel it. I just made me feel well. 


I also noticed it has less itching and respiratory depression, which makes it preferable to heroin in that way. I do kinda miss the rush of snorting heroin, but I could settle for a nice steady buzz like this instead. Suboxone has a half life of like 36 hours or something, so I assume I will be buzzed throughout the next day at least. Even heroin bleeds over a little bit into the next day.


What do you think? Is it wise, if I'm gonna use opiates recreationally at all, to just use suboxone instead of heroin? The one thing about suboxone is at least you know it will never contain fent after all. ",1508205742.0

I had about 8 hours of flight time which included a 1 hour layover in a city that shares a name with the type of bird Dumbledore had. Unfortunately neither of my DBoys were picking up and I was already running late for the flight so I had to settle for 210mgs worth of Oxycodone. This would be enough to keep me well until I reached my destination. 

&nbsp;

So I arrive in my layover city and begin looking for my terminal. Unbeknowst to me there was an hour delay getting out of my original city so what was supposed to be a 1 hour layover ended up being about 5 minutes. Needless to say I missed my layover. The even worse news was that I missed the last flight out for the night. The airline comped me a hotel room and booked me on the first flight out in the morning but I knew I was about to be in trouble if I didn't find some way to get well.

&nbsp;

So I'm sitting in the airport charging my phone (it had died on the flight) and in full blown panic mode trying to figure out the best way to score in a city I had never been to before. I was using the bottom plug because I couldn't get the top one to work. While I was sitting there 3 different people walked up and tried using the top plug but to no avail. Out of nowhere a girl walks up, plops down, and plugs her phone in. I advise her that no one could get it to work but she looks down and tells me that it is working fine. Odd. We get to talking and she asks me where I'm going. I tell her the city and she replies that she went to Rehab in that city. What a coincidence, that is also why I'm traveling there. Turns out we also have the same DOC. I ask her if she's local to layover city and as luck would have it she is. I ask if she still has any connections in the area and of course she does. She takes down my number and says she will have someone hit me up when her flight lands. 2 hours later and I'm giving her friend directions to my hotel and a half hour after that I'm trying BTH for the first time in my life. All praise be to JJ for sending this wonderful Junkie Angel into my life right when I needed her most.

There was no guard on the clippers when she ran them back over her ears without a mirror and left the tuft of blonde hair on top.  She had more bag under her eyes than cheek and those deep creases circled down her face and back up to her brown eyes as testimonies to her life of suffering and loss.  She only had half of her top teeth, and she sold drugs from her queen-sized bed in dirty cotton panties and bare breasted.  An old stretchmark ran jagged like a bolt of lightning through her doughy abdomen that hung over the elastic waistband of her stained panties.

A stranger might hand me a grease stained box half filled with some unidentifiable sludge and a chunk of what was alleged to be chicken breast, or I might beat out the last bit of my peach yogurt onto my blackened palm before licking it up unashamed and starving for passersby to see.

Other times I had spells of de ja vu like I had seen these very same things in the same order in a dream a long time ago, or maybe it was the effect of living the same reality over and over again as the universe exploded out of nothing and created everything before it imploded in on itself and did it again.

You give and take away.‚Äù  The theology struck me as odd, but I appreciated the passion before their friend came out to give his testimony of being a depressed teenager who found life and joy in Jesus Christ.  I thought that sounded nice but didn‚Äôt apply to me.  There were holes in my arms that had to be filled, and I regarded nothing as sacred.

And another time I met a 54-year-old woman named Donna squatting against the wall next to me out of the rain and smoking a cigarette. She wore funeral parlor perfume that seemed to be mingled with the aromas of mental illness and mildew.  Her mascara ran in the rain, and flecks of red lipstick stuck to her teeth.  She bit her cigarette.  She punched me in the shoulder.  She pointed her finger.

‚ÄúLook at that!‚Äù  A dramatic scene unfolded 60 feet from where we crouched.  EMTs rolled a blue lipped and grey faced person in a gurney out of Fred Meyer‚Äôs and into the back of the ambulance.  I couldn‚Äôt tell if the person was a man or a woman.  I just knew they were ugly.

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs that?‚Äù

‚ÄúJerianne.  I guess she‚Äôs not coming back to the apartment with me this afternoon.  Bahaha.  Screwed it up?  Didn‚Äôt ya, Jerianne?  She always does!‚Äù  She threw the rest of her cigarette into a puddle. ‚ÄúYou wanna come home with me?‚Äù


We walked west a few blocks and took a left up a steep hill to her apartment where she told me about how perverted the attendant at the corner gas station was and then let me crawl all over her in the dark.  Afterwards we smoked cigarettes and talked in bed.

‚ÄúMy son died 4 years ago in a car accident on the coast in Washington.  He was everything to me.  He was all I had.  I tried to kill myself last month with my methadone and colonopin but it didn‚Äôt work.  I took my whole month‚Äôs worth of methadone and my colonopin too, but I woke up in the morning.  The doctors filled my scripts again but now I have to take classes three days a week for the nine more months, and I still wish I was dead.‚Äù

That‚Äôs life though.  One morning you‚Äôre on your knees kissing your pregnant wife‚Äôs belly and buying diapers and rolling out pink paint on the 
walls of the room with the crib for the baby girl you‚Äôll be bringing home any day now, but the next morning you‚Äôre on your knees in a hospital waiting room clutching your face and screaming with blood on your shirt and trying to understand why.  It happens.  People lose their most precious relationships in an instant, and there‚Äôs nothing they can do about it but die themselves.  She chose a slow death and hurt all along the way.

We rented movies from the library and watched them over and over without ever knowing what they were about, because we snored through them.  Anything filmed in the early 90s invoked strong feelings for me, because they were from when I was a kid, before the hatred consummated within.  I dreamed of living the life of one of the unnamed extras and disappearing into the fictitious background of Lethal Weapon 2 or Backdraft where life was of no consequence and Michael Jordan was winning championships in Chicago. It was not uncommon for her to wake up with large holes burnt into her sheets from nodding out with lit cigarettes.

‚ÄúDid I set my bed on fire last night?  I think I remember that!  Haha!  Yeah.  Now I remember.  I woke up and the sheets were on fire.  There was a fire last night!  Yup.  Sure was.  Jeesh!  You‚Äôd think that I‚Äôd remember something like that.  Haha!  Almost burned myself up in a fire and the whole building too.  Haha!‚Äù

In the daytime, she helped me boost merchandise from stores, but I was good at it even without her.  I strategized to either be in and out as quickly as possible, or if I thought a secret shopper was following me, I would walk from one side of the store up an aisle back to the other side, and down another aisle, and back up it.  If anyone followed me for all of that, I would ask him why he was following me.  They never knew what to say.  If they were on the phone, I would ask them to say hello to their mothers for me.  If they were in the health food section, I asked what a tub of lard like them was doing buying raw organic almonds.  Sometimes, I would fill a hand basket and get their attention by walking toward the door and drop it, right before I walked out.  Then, while they put the items back or talked to each other about it in the room full of monitors, I would walk back through the store and steal what I wanted.  Donna kept lookout, and I filled my bags with DVDs and walked out with my arms full of merchandise and the alarms going off.

She kicked me out one morning after I got high and slept on the couch.  A few days after that I got high on meth and texted her from under a dumpster about her naked 54-year-old body and what I wanted to do it.  She forwarded the explicit messages along with her own haranguing texts to my mother every day for weeks.  My mom told me that Donna sent 28 texts before noon on a Tuesday, and none of them made any sense.

In late May I found a cup of cold coffee in a trashcan and threw it on her downtown.  She called the cops and tried to tell them I was a thief, which they already knew but couldn‚Äôt take me to jail on.  It was in Pioneer Square where I used to sit and wait for licks or plant my feet in one spot with straight legs and fold at the waist like a taco trying to touch my nose to my big toe and drooling. People always stopped and woke me up to ask if I was okay or if I needed some help, but I was doing great.

I moved for work after that and came the city to pick up from this girl I met.  Her name was Breezy, and it was good to have a steady hook up even if it meant riding the bus two hours out to he place and two hours back to where I slept every night. I did day labor and slept under the awning of a nail salon across the street. At four I woke up to catch rides with the crew out to the landfill where we worked. The guy who drove had the aura of a potato. He wore a leather jacket. He drove a truck. He grew a bushy beard. He mumbled something about alimony payments and a daughter on our cigarette break once, but when I pictured him going home to his sad life, he was a potato, a soft, lumpy potato crying on his pillow.  After a few weeks, the company fired me for stealing other people‚Äôs lunches and sleeping in the bushes while on the clock, but I tried to make life in Vancouver work anyway.  I didn‚Äôt give up until the incident in which a local army veteran paid me five dollars and a 99-cent cheeseburger to deposit a certain bodily fluid on a lacy pair of panties in a graveyard.  Then I moved back to the city.

On a Saturday night, a stumbling and drunk Mexican flashed the money in his wallet at me by Voodoo doughnuts.  He wanted me to be his date or sex or something, but it ended up that he spent about five minutes licking the side of my face while I got his wallet out of his back pocket and took the money.  It was a 200-dollar come up, and I skipped around town until I pulled my money out to buy crack from a big group of black men in China town.  They jumped me badly and robbed me.

As Sunday morning broke the splatter of cold rain on the sidewalk soaked into my newspaper blankets under a Chinatown stoop.  I couldn‚Äôt sleep, and the loss of the 200 dollars was my only thought.  My leg and hip hurt from getting jumped.  It had been such a happy moment to have that money in my pocket for the morning, but I called Breezy anyway and appealed to her compassion.  She told me to come see her in an apartment downtown where she was getting tattooed.

In the room, Breezy and her 19 year old girlfriend laid face down to get lace tattooed down the back of their legs.  It was an ordeal, and they squirmed and squealed.  The lady whose place it was kept talking to her dead girlfriend like she was floating in the room with us, and their tattoo artist asked if he should start a mobile tattoo business even though it was illegal. Breezy gave me a hit to hold me over, and we hung out for a while before I left.

I bought from her a lot, because she was reliable and always holding and generous.  She fronted or gave me dope, because she liked me.  It wasn‚Äôt long after we met that I came to see her at her hotel room to find her jerking around her room collecting some belongings in a bag and sweating in a curly blonde wig.

‚ÄúHere you go.  Can you watch my place for me?  Some f***ing scumbag tried to rob me earlier.  I need someone here if he tries to come back.‚Äù  She handed me a few chunks of heroin and meth.  Maybe she had reason to think the place was about to get raided and wouldn‚Äôt mind if I took the fall.  

‚ÄúYeah, I can watch the place.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I trust you.  I‚Äôll be back tomorrow.‚Äù  Her girlfriend wasn‚Äôt around.  She was with a guy, and they took off in a truck.  Later, she used this incident to make me feel special and said,

‚ÄúYou are special.  I never trust people like that, but I knew you were different from the start.‚Äù

It took her a day or so to come back, and we got close when she did.  Breezy chased her 19-year-old girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous, before she moved on to the next fling.  I texted Danielle back in Cincinatti even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Breezy.  Breezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.

Breezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m.  Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up.  Slapping her didn‚Äôt work.  Screaming was useless.  We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference.  It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters which were her favorite.  She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day.  Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.

She gave me five balloons of heroine one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Breezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills from which I took three.  I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off ten minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.

At the Nordstram Rack I packed as many bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors.  It was the 4th time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in 2 weeks, and it was also obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me.  I kept going anyway and juggled the 5 heroine balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out.  As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,

‚ÄúSTOP RIGHT THERE!!!!‚Äù

I bolted down the street after a woman scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me.  A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and 3 yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk.  I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river.  There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers.  Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.

Later I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground.  They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn‚Äôt going back to the hotel.  I told Breezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,

‚ÄúCome back.  I don‚Äôt care.  It doesn‚Äôt matter to me.  I want you back here.  You are too important to me.‚Äù

The days at Breezy‚Äôs went by hot and slow.  It was June, and it seemed like everyone was in and out all day everyday.  We never had time together, and I could tell she wanted to get me alone.  The place finally cleared out one afternoon, and I said,

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving, too,‚Äù to scavenge for something to trade her for more drugs.

‚ÄúWhy would you leave now?  Huh?  Everyone finally left us alone and now you want to leave?  What‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù  Desperation and hurt squeezed through her voice box from across the room.

‚ÄúOh.  I didn‚Äôt know you wanted me to stay.‚Äù  I knew she wanted to have sex with me, and I felt the same, mostly from the drugs and the weird bio chemical things that happen when a boy and girl spend too much time together.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, then.‚Äù  She put her legs up on the table, and we both grimaced at a bad smell in the room.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take a shower.‚Äù

She told everyone about it.  Her friend, Gay Kevin, told me she said it was the best she had in a long time, and I was proud of myself.  But as the days continued the meth overrode the heroin, and I never slept except the time she made me and I spilled water all over her in the bed.  She laughed about it and changed the sheets, but she could be really mean too, like when I repeated myself.

‚ÄúYeah, I know, Riley.  You already said that.  Try saying something different.  I‚Äôm tired of hearing the same old s*** from you all the time.‚Äù  But, she was kind to me about the water I spilled on her.  When I needed a haircut, she sat me down in the kitchen and cut it.  She did a good job, too.  I kept shaved for her because that‚Äôs what she liked.

‚ÄúThanks for the hit, baby.‚Äù

‚ÄúRiley?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call me baby.  That‚Äôs not my f***ing name!‚Äù  I pretended I never heard it and referred to her as babes within a half hour.



I stalked up and down the road in the June sun, Quasimodo‚Äôs skeleton sweating and scheming all day, marching back and forth to the department store.  Someone told me shooting up in the thin veins in my wrists was the most likely place to kill me with a clot.  I didn‚Äôt know if it was true, but I shot up there just in case.  Everyone told me the same thing, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a gun, Riley.  Armed robbery is not worth it.‚Äù  But it was more about putting a bullet in the ceiling, jumping onto the counter and screaming for everyone to get on the ground.  It was my new obsession but no one would give me a gun.  I fantasized armed robbery in Breezy‚Äôs kitchen and sweated listening for cars through the blinds.

She punched me in the face one night for trying to defend myself against some grievance one of her ex-girlfriends had against me.  It was getting more and more difficult to be there, and it seemed like she hated me.  One night she had sex with several guys right in front of me and wouldn‚Äôt even look at me when I talked to her afterwards.  I kept trying to get her attention, but Gay Kevin said,

‚ÄúLet it alone.  She don‚Äôt want to talk to you right now.‚Äù  He knew her better than I did, but I tried to grab her bags of meth and heroine to insult her.  She hid the dope under her butt and told me to leave.   As I made my way towards the door, one of the guys she slept with screamed obscenities and threats of stabbing me from the bathroom.

I‚Äôve always heard that Roosevelt said, ‚ÄúSpeak softly and carry a big stick.‚Äù I ran my mouth and when that didn‚Äôt work I used whatever I could to impose my will and destroy things.  In this case it happened to be the wooden bat she kept by the door. I jumped over the bed and almost kicked the pocket door down before I pulled him out by his hair and drove the bat like a splitting maul to his head.  It connected on the side of his skull behind his ear.  He crumpled to the ground.

Breezy jumped onto my back, so I reached behind her head and hooked her armpit to body slam her onto the floor.  She gasped as the wind knocked out of her.  Gay Kevin charged me but bounced off me and went to the ground like an empty Styrofoam cup in the wind, and we spent the next few minutes in a tornado of random objects flying around the room.  I launched Breezy backwards through the air with my legs.  The blinds came down with her, and she moaned like she might be seriously hurt.  The men shook in fear as I backed towards the door and grabbed a sleeping back on my way out.  My stay there was up, and the cops were coming.

In a room of what were supposed to be hardened criminals, violent types, people to be feared I was the only one living up to my persona and the things I said.  Everyone bluffed and lied about the danger they presented, but like a poker game I laid down four aces almost every time the chips were on the table.  They all had nothing in their hands, and you can‚Äôt win with nothing when your bluff is called.  It wasn‚Äôt that I was tough or bad.  If anything I was a coward and selfish and stupid most of all, but I had soaked up everything I ever saw or heard since I was little like a sponge.  I adapted and thrived in any environment that didn‚Äôt kill me.  My environments were criminal and my life was violent, so that‚Äôs what I was good at.

The sirens wailed in the distance.  There was a boarded up strip club a block away where I hid in the bushes behind it with my sleeping bag.  I went back into Portland the next morning and never saw Breezy again.

76u1xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/76u1xw/changes/,7,https://redd.it/76u1xw,thetruth_00,Changes,"Hey all,

I've been a long-time lurker in this sub, and occasional poster under a different username for the past several years. This sub has been an incredible support for many, including myself. 

I live in NorCal, and have been evacuated from my home for the last week due to the wildfires that have ravaged my town. I have been abusing both my prescriptions, and bought meds ""on the street"" for the past year or so, and came clean (no pun intended) to my family last week, before the fires hit. I met with my doctor who prescribed me methadone to help with the WD. Right now, I feel incredibly lost, and without the structure of regular life and work, the desire to use has been incredibly prevalent. I have been taking the methadone to avoid WDs, but it has been incredibly hard not to use. I feel like using has been my one source of happiness, and now that life is turned upside down, it has been even harder. I don't have much in the way of structure right now, and have a great deal of free time due to no work.

There's not much reason for this post, other than venting and to maybe talk to others who are in a similar situation. I'm doing my best not to go pick up, and so far today has been a success. ",1508191828.0

I love this dude.  We've always vibed and he's always been real with me with if I'm acting fiendish n shit. Just overall a cool dude with good product consistently.  Anyways, he had some dope and so did I.  Literally the day before, my roommates found me passed out in my room on the floor with ""coke"" on my table.  I told them I had just been going to hard with the coke and was on xanax and just fell asleep.  The ""coke"" was actually some white dope.  Fent laced dope.  Well, my dude has a much higher tolly than I do, so I just give him one of the two 10 bags I brought.  He had already done some of his, but he poured it out and did it all at once.  Immediately, my homie just looks fucked up.  He's standing up and leaning a little and just laughing basically cuz he knows how high he is.  Well, he starts to not respond to things I'm saying and falling out.  I had him for 3-5 mins before I got his girl to hear me calling her.  She started tripping pretty fast and we just decided to call an ambulance to be safe.  While she was calling, we walked him from the back room to the living room in the front of  the house to be closer to  the door when the ambulance arrived. The operator kept asking the same question.  What's the problem?  ""My friend is passed out and not breathing very well (very shallow) it could be an od but I'm not sure I said.  Is it an od?  ""I think so"".  Is he breathing?  ""Barely please send an ambulance""  While his gf was on the phone, I literally gave my homie mouth to mouth to put some air in his lungs when it sounded a little long between breaths and pushing on his solarplex a small amount to get him to exhale.  I've never had any prior experience with CPR or mouth to mouth but I feel like I did the right thing even tho the operator said I probably shouldn't cuz it could hurt him. Fuck you so could lack of oxygen and hes barely breathing.  He was still falling out.  He'd come around a little like mumble, then pass out again.  As soon as the ambulance and police got there, he was back, and able to cover his ass and say he thinks he just took some oxy 30s instead of Aleve, because he kept his 30s in an Aleve bottle.  I had grabbed the h too just in case the police tried to search or some shit but no, nothing like that.  They were just there to help.  I just wanted to share what happened and thank God I didn't trip out and panic.  ",1508191576.0

I used just about every drug I ever wanted to try. Thc, dissociatives, psychedelics, stims, depressants, and of course opiates. 

My all time favorite substance is ketamine, followed closely by good ole heroin.

I'm getting a bit off topic here, but please hear me out bropiates. 

My point is, that whatever substance I was using, I could've stopped and put it down at any given moment.

But once I discovered opiates my friends....when I snorted that first line of dope, when the opiate mami grabbed me by the dick and balls and refused to let go..Thought I was in heaven. Every couple hours I would go to the bathroom, unpack the gear out of this ""Slic"" stash lighter, do a tiny line, cleanup and I knew I'd be lifted  a minute later. No anxiety of any kind, no troubling thoughts of any kind. I felt clear. I was happy. My balls were happy.

Until a point where your genius self forgets to defecate during a monthly binge. Until you realize you've spent all your money on the opiate DOC. Until you notice that you've lost connection between all your family members, your true friends, the love of your life, because the opiate family is the only family that matters to you.

Then you Really decide you want to quit this habit. Stop with the getting high rituals, but you can't. It's too late to turn back now. You realize you lost everything. 

You decide to go to rehab either way, get sober, turn this shit life around, but you cant. Rehab after rehab, nothing's changing. You keep using because you feel like you can't live without this overload of euphoria in the brain. 

So you start mixing a buffet of all different drugs to substitute that sweet opiate high for, but it will never be the same. 

One day you say ""fuck it"" and do enough ""mixing""to overdose. You land in the hospital, a psych ward, or jail (unless you're dead).

 
The day of release you're hitting the dboy up for some dope, do a few mgs too many, end up OD'ing. Funeral comes and everyone you once loved is crying by your casket.",1508189845.0

It wasn't long before I learned to identify when my dboy was deep in a bar blur. Usually the first sign was hearing his slurred speech on the phone followed by him repeating himself and taking an unusually long time to meet me at the spot (often he'd forget, so it was my job to keep reminding). Usually this would bother me, but I started to act on these indicators and start asking for credit. I'd wait, he'd forget, and I'd have free product. The trick was to hit him up in a few days, not saying I was trying to meet up to pay... and if he brought it up, I'd pay like this is what we expected. If he said nothing, I would not bring it up.


This didn't always work -- but prior to last week, I maybe had pulled this three times for a total of 4 free buns.


But last week was the most fruitful. I called asking for credit, expecting a bun or two and by no means certain I'd be getting for free. Upon meeting up, before I could even say anything, he had handed me a brick and asked if I was cool with that. It was completely uncharacteristic of him and at first I didn't want it because I knew I'd blow it too fast and have to pay it back. But he insisted I should take it and that he didn't want it on him going home. It was at this point I noticed that he seemed quite relaxed and slurry. So I accepted the brick and stayed vigilante. 

Sure enough I called the following day... and all he said was... ""What you need?""


Now trust me I am stunned by this as well. I mean doesn't he wake up the next morning and wonder why he's missing product/cash? I thought the same but so far nothing has come back.

Does anybody else deal with this kinda thing?

If something pushed me around I used to kick it in the teeth with a smile. Now I find I have nothing to draw on. No will. No fight left in me. No lasting resolve. My best attributes are now just tools my addiction uses against me. I'm beat in every sense of the word-physically, mentally, spiritually, emotionally, financially. Funny how when you're low using is most attractive. I suppose that's just addiction.

I do have a reason to smile though. Things could ALWAYS be worse. I'm alive. Tomorrow brings at least the possibility of happiness. I stayed sober this 24 hrs. Though at times sobriety feels like a curse, I know every day that I'm sober distances me from this whole shit show.

I was miserable, depressed, angry, and grieving my loss of heroin(I still am) One day I woke up thankful to no longer wake up in withdrawal or crying and shitting and puking all at once not even able to make to the car to go get dope with the 20 fucking dollars I scraped up , that wouldn't even shake the withdrawal. I've been clean 4 months now and I'm finally happy. I miss my old lifestyle and I miss the ever living fuck out of heroin. But I'm alive. My new sober friends mean the world to me and they're alive. Someone I know relapses and ODs an ungodly amount here , but I'm blessed it's not me. I'm the LAST person that would ever be sober but if I can do it and be genuinely happy to wake up and make commitments 2 days from now and actually show up, then anyone can do it. At no point was this easy, everyday is work but with the right support system and groups and addiction counselers and real friends to hold me accountable, I can do anything now. I don't have to be a sketchy fucking loser anymore. I'm sorry to be preachy but this sub was a big part of my life for 2 years and I know every single one of you don't have to live like this anymore.

774let,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/774let/thoughts_on_my_detox_plan/,2,https://redd.it/774let,Th3k1d93,Thoughts on my detox plan?,"The goal isn't sobriety here, the goal is lowering my overall dosage to a more manageable level.

I'm currently on 55mg of methadone every day for pain management. I've been at this level for a year now. I would like to lower that to 20mg devided into 10mg morning/10mg night.  I want to attempt this jump fairly fast. 

So, my thoughts are to take a week off work, acquire a fairly large amount of ketamine and etizolam (Just my preferred benzo), and almost coma myself through the worst. I have no tolerance to any substance outside of opiates and marijuana. Last benzo use was over 6 months ago, and last ketamine use was 17 months. 

Day one, take 35mg of methadone. I wont feel bad until the next day a anyways due to methadone's ridiculous halflife.

Day two, 30 mg of methadone, maybe a mg or two of etizolam. This would be my last day at work.

Day three, 20 mg of methadone, 2mg etiz in the am. Dose ketamine and etiz as needed for discomfort here. Marijuana as needed for nausea.

Day 4 through 9, continue with 20mg of methadone, split into 10 mg am/pm doses. Use I.M. ketamine in heavy doses to stay in a mostly anesthetized state. Sublingual etizolam in 1mg increments as needed. Marijuana as needed for nausea. 

I would return to work on day 10, still using 20mg of methadone split into 10mg am/pm doses. I would be willing to continue etizolam for as many as 4 more days following return to work. Marijuana would be used, but that's business as normal.

I guess my question is, obviously besides the bare minimum that's expected to be felt from any strong opioid withdrawal, do you think i could get through this taper with next to nothing in terms of discomfort?


EDIT: Because of ketamine's NMDA antagonist properties, it's been proven to lower opiate tolerance. I would also supplement with minerals, including magnesium citrate (another NMDA antagonist), and ashwagandha to control cortisol spikes. I also have access to hospital sealed saline bags, and iv equipment. So I.V. fluids could be a strong possibility as well.",1508304716.0

I unfortunately have become a redditor as all the old forums I used to frequent seem as if they're filled with addiction counselors more than actual fucking users.

anyways, months ago I decided to try heroin, after months of daily SMALL dose codeine abuse, then a surgery which introduced me to the loveliness of 20mg iv morphine mixed with 4 percs (surprisingly i was headbanging out the car window VERY stimulated and energetic and not anywhere close to nodding) then 60 more percs before they cut me off.

called a friend so I can get some heroin for this ""junkie that wont stop bothering me"" and purchased .4...oh did I mention I had a 8mg/day xanax habit at this point too.

now truthhfully, half my intentions were for pain relief and also I just love opiates (just like my dad did, my entire life) so as soon as I get home i take a little tan rock out of this baggie and throw it on the trusty old mg scale (after calibrating, closing windows....I am a advocate of harm reduction) and it measured out to 24mg...powdered it on an old phone and pushed it into 3 lines....here we go, 1 down....5 mins pass with no effect (at this point in my life ive snorted ketamine 2cc and lots of coke, all of which ive felt within a minute or two. my ignorance here made me think its not enough) line number two down, I message a buddy and let him know what im doing and to E-sit me, then i felt that rush of euphoria up my spine and tell him oh fuck its hitting stay online. wake up 4-5 hrs later slumped over my chair feeling the closest to death i ever have, called said friend and he said he cant understand me, call 911, which i did. police ambulance and my friend all show up at the same damn and the paramedics keep saying his heartrates high it was probably cocaine and the cops were like yea see its in lines on the phone people dont do heroin like that.....all while my friends like with all due respect if you have no idea what your talking about and his heartrates up because he suffers from anxiety disorders and just woke up from death....went to the hospital and walked home as soon as I was sober enough to realize wtf was going on.

TLDR: I tried herion once, 16mg insufflated...almost died, 3 days later the news is talking about a fentanyl crisis, someone even died from the same batch.

now I've acquired some #4 afghan from a very well reputed supplier, own fentanyl testing strips and WILL have a present sitter  with my naloxane kit in hand.

I've lived in a small town for all of my life, going up to the closest city was always a bit of an adventure as a kid. It wasn't even that far away but regardless we still got so much excitement getting the train up for a wander around. So many people, so much to do! 

After all the excitement around the city died down as I grew older and it became more of a chore than anything else to commute to the city for whatever reason I had for going I've now found myself at school in a city 100 miles away from my little home town. 100 miles might not be too much for anyone in the states, but to me in the UK it's quite a journey! 

So many nerves and worries were floating around my head before the move. Will my flatmates be decent? Will I be able to keep better control of my finances? Is the city I'm moving to going to be decent? Will missing my girlfriend be overwhelming at times? You'd think these worries would be the main thing on my mind but really they were answered quickly. Yes, no, yes and incredibly. 

There was one thought that particularly worried me. Will I be able to find a hookup? 

This was running through my mind for the entire move, worrying that I'd need to bring gear up from home and hope it's last until I was back down. Man was that worry unjustified! 

I move up, get all my shit unpacked and head out into the wild to try cold copping. It'd always been successful back home but it wasn't without some amount of effort, waiting about and bother. 

I head out, kick about for a bit and chat to some beggars who ended up being more drinkers than being into anything else, or so they said anyway. After about three quarters of an hour wondering around I spot a beggar outside a local supermarket chatting to a mate. I wait for what felt like forever for his mate to leave and for the police who were dealing with some drunken kids outside a church to finally leave. 

Walk up to him, give him a fiver and get straight to the point this time. Dudes straight to the point back, ""Yup, have it with you within five minutes."" Of course I think he's chatting shit and I'll really be waiting about for two hours as he calls everyone he knows. Man I was in for a pleasant surprise. 

Five minute walk up the road, the dude rings the buzzer, says his name, takes my cash and we head in. He asks me to wait in the foyer and as always I wasn't really wanting to give my cash legs and he probably knew this. Dude hands me his back back and fucks off upstairs. I hear them exchanging pleasantaries and he goes in. Stand there for a couple minutes and before I know it he's back rushing out the door and I'm standing with a gram in my hand. 

Dude lets me know that he's in that spot daily and to come find him when I'm needing again. Most seamless cop of my life. Totally unexpected.

That recent Vice story about the routes to heroin addiction doesn't touch on a couple of related issues. This whole pill crackdown has caused many people to move to illicit opiates because their legitimate chronic pain is not being managed or they are being completely denied meds.

Someone very close to me went through all sorts of hell and so much extra time and effort to treat their pain. And this was a terminal metastatic cancer patient...bones, lymph nodes, you name it, were being eaten up by cancerous cells. Even when they got appropriate dosing, maintaining the supply was hours of work and driving a week. They had to pick up the script at the clinic for refills even, and all the different regulatory controls at the doctor, the pharmacy, and worst of all, the insurer. All of this made it a part time job just to get the meds. Fucking made me so mad. 

All of this was so hard on her, but the reality is that her team of caregivers bore the brunt of this on top of all the work required for a bedridden stage IV cancer patient. Thank God for so many good people on the caregiving team, but there was hundreds of hours of unpaid work being done by many. I wanted to bill the pharmacy and insurer for all the work they created for people.

Pharmacy out of stock? Try to find another one. Pharmacy had some meds but not the whole script worth? Can't fill that because that would wipe out the rest of the script (absurd CA law/reg regarding opiates)? If she did take the partial script then you get to play the phone call game with the overworked cancer clinic to get another script. Or the phone call game with the insurer...or maybe the ombudsman for the insurer because they were refusing to pay for a new med the doc prescribed. So many conflicting rules with all the different cogs in the entire sick system.

And all of this is happening with the stress of knowing the a loved one is going to be in serious pain and, God forbid, go into withdrawals on top of the crushing pain if meds ran out. The whole experience just made her and us feel like we were a fucking hamster getting nowhere in the Habitrail of Hell. So much extra work and time and waiting when IT COULD BE SO MUCH FUCKING EASIER without all the red tape.

Anyway, I went off on a tangent here, but my last point is that all these folks that have legit need and get pushed out of the system end up at a much higher risk for harm, death and worsening addictions without the oversight of a doctor and the limits and assistance the system does have. Yes, I know I complained about that system, but my point is that it is so ONEROUS the way it is now. It causes people to suffer terribly that are as legit as it gets and pushes other people out creating a much worse problem for them.

Portugal has it right. Hey US Americans! Worried about the addiction problem? STOP TREATING IT AS A CRIMINAL PROBLEM. Let patients have their meds. Offer assistance to those that are having problems with addiction and help them recover IF THEY WANT IT. More education and easier access to docs would be a start. Fucking rapacious health insurers and jackass politicians are truly causing a shit load of misery and bad outcomes.

Just love racing while on opiates.

Even better is going to a foreign country like dubai, UAE or Germany and getting an exotic car like a 911 GT3 or Lamborghini Huracan, getting a Red Bull, and popping some norcos or blues or snorting and then driving, and while your driving the high starts kicking in and suddenly everything is so wonderful and it feels so good the leather, and the speed are exhilarating.

Does anyone notice when taking an opioid/opiate that you can withstand greater extremes in temperature without finding it bothersome at all? When I occasionally stop taking them, it feels like both heat and cold ""stick to my skin"" in an uncomfortable way and the feeling of both hot and cold seems amplified, this is also without hot flashes or cold sweats, it's purely about the temperature. However, when I resume something like Kratom Per se, both hot and cold feel more normal, if not even less intense than normal. In other words, you're warmed up on a cold winter day, and can better withstand the heat of a summer day... Temperature just doesn't bother you as much anymore. I may be able to notice this since I take clonidine when withdrawing, so I'm able to notice warmth more because my blood vessels are still dilated rather than the normal constriction (I think) that occurs during withdrawal.

Now, what's interesting is that, in opiate-naive people, administration of opiates DID lead to decreased sensation of extreme temps, both hot and cold. So, I know there's something real going on here, just thought it would be interesting to see of other people notice it.",1508275570.0

Everyone says it does, but it didn't for me after 2 years.","2 years ago, I found a full bottle of 5mg oxy in my grandma's pantry which she stopped taking because she was switched to morphine. Having heard it was one of the most euphoric feelings in the world, I decided to take some. My family and I would go there once a week, which ultimately led me to taking it once a week. This continued for about 3 months, then I noticed something felt missing from my life during the weeks. It did not feel like physical opiate withdrawal, just like something was missing from my life and being way too excited for the weekend so i could do oxy. So, I forced myself to take a 3 week break. After the break, I was back at it for another 3 months (still only once a week). This cycle repeated for almost a year (with a few weeks skipped), at that point I was like ""I really need to stop doing this because one day she's gonna wanna take an oxy and see that most of the bottle is gone"". I then learned that she wasn't taking the oxy because it made her sick and interfered with other medical complications. Later that day I decided to look in a little compartment of the pantry and HOLY MOTHER OF GOD THERES 2 MORE FULL BOTTLES. The cycle continued, I had a few slip ups where i took it twice a week or twice a weekend, but those  were always followed by 2 weeks off. I also had a month to 2 month long break in that period because we stopped going there for a while. I have to say, i know this sounds strange and contrary to popular opinion but the longer the cycle continued at that point, I craved them less during the weeks because it was just part of my routine. I never upped my dosage. I find weed to be more behaviorally addictive because of the lack of consequences from pot use, therefore giving me little to no motivation to stop. Sadly, a few months after that she died of pancreatic cancer. Feeling like absolute ass, I took the oxy bottle and the morphine bottle. That week I took it 4 times, the last time being 35mg spaced throughout the day. The week after that I took morphine XR twice and oxy once. Luckily, I decided the most logical thing to do was sell most of it since it's retarded expensive. Now, I haven't had opiates in 2 weeks and only have 15mg oc left. Withdrawals were nothing more than me missing the high. Although that could have been because i was self-medicating every other day with either xanax, phenibut, kratom or gabapentin and smoking weed nearly every day. I would never recommend anyone to establish a regular opiate use schedule, but exactly how irresponsible was this run? I honestly don't think it had a very negative effect on my life. Oxy is the best pill high in the world (in my opinion), and anyone who enjoys it would desperately want to believe that there has to be some way to use it responsibly. There is a way with pretty much every other non-hard drug. It seems like everyone thinks that any ""regular"" oxy usage leads to a broken bank and eventually heroin. Was this responsible recreational usage?",1508275407.0

 Been doing drugs recreationally since prob age 17. Didnt know anything about the opiate scene until about 2 years ago, when I tried some percs, didnt understand why people get hooked on opiates. Fast forward a bit, I try perc again but this time a proper dose OHH now I see why. This is awesome. But I never got hooked, kept it recreational, my dealer had the usual, beginner stuff. Percs, sometimes Oxy 20 or 40 mg, hydros. Dilaudid. At this point (around 12-14 months ago) heroin/fent or any of that hard shit never crossed my mind ever. 

Liked opiates a lot, loved snorting a dilaudid 8mg and feeling that warm pleasant euphoria. With oxy/dilaudid/morphine/hydromorph that I would do recreationally, i never had issues. Didnt experience any ""wd"" since I would do opiates like once a week max. 

Anyways, fast forward a bit and id get a bit crazier, doing dilaudid like 4-5 days in a row (still low tolerance so only one or two 8mg a day snorted) After a week of everyday I experienced my first WD, was minor, didnt think anything of it and decided to take a break. 

My point is, at the beginning of my opiate use i was careful and smart about it. 

Then I acquired a large sum of money and me and a buddy started doing dilaudid everyday. Long story short this escalated into me being on opiates all the time. Dealer introduced us to these ""oxy 80mg"" We looked at them and I told my friend ""dude i bet you these are the fake oxy 80s that i keep reading about"". I wasn't dumb, i knew they werent real oxys. So i carefully crushed up the pill and dosed very safely because I had no fucking idea how strong it might be. Long story short was amazing bang for the buck. I got hooked on fake oxy 80s with fentanyl/carfentanil in them for a solid 2-3 months daily. No one knew i was hooked.

After some really hard struggles i managed to get through the withdrawal and stayed clean for a while, like 2 months. That was the last time I ever had withdrawals because after that I went back to my old ways of using opiates in moderation. I kept telling myself that opiates are ok as long as I do them in moderation, that way there is no withdrawal! my tolerance stays low etc.. So yeah. 

Now HERE is where i am fucking confused. After my long break from opiates (the fentanyl/carfentanil strong shit.. to give you an idea of how strong these fake oyxs were.. one day me and my buddy were in withdrawals and we were trying to score.. I told him we should try scoring H. We got a half gram each of good quality H. I snorted the entire half G that night  and it BARELY tickled my withdrawals from the carfentanil oxy 80s.. my first time trying H! and it wasnt shitty H !)

Anyways, in the last 4-5 months like I said, only been doing opiates in moderation except this time it was H and sometimes fentanyl. H actually works now because I went 2 months clean, so my tolerance went back to normal, so the first time I snorted H and it actually worked I loved it. 

HOWEVER.. Something is fucked up. When i was hooked on the fentanyl/carfentanil.. I would get the normal opiate symptoms.. I nodded, would act slow etc.. But now something is very fucking different.

NOW when I do fentanyl or H or any other similar opiate I act fucking crazy. Like, sometimes when I would do too much H I would act completely fucking insane? Like talking to myself, acting like a fucking lunatic on the street type shit, instead of putting me down and nodding me out.. now when I do opiates its OBVIOUS im fucking high. Of course this has to do with my way lower tolerance, but like I act way different. Its like my brain responds to opiates differently now. Let me further explain. Whenever you see people on H they are sleepy/noddy.. but me, if I OD (do too much) I sweat like fucking crazy, and I ACT crazy, like I act like a complete fucking retard, even my friends told me, and they would film me to show me when i was sober. I don't understand, how come I dont just act chill and nod out? Once I snorted some H or fentanyl or whatever it was.. prob H cut with some fent, and the beginning is a normal warm awesome opiate rush.. but after the high progresses, I act fucking weird and crazy. Like someone called the cops on me, sometimes I take my shirt off and start scratching like a maniac, I SORTOF act similar to what i imagine people on PCP act like? Or bath salts? that type of shit? It doesn't make sense. Do you know anyone that acts crazy on hard opiates? 
I am done because I feel so fucking guilty, my parents have seen me fucked up so many times. Before when I was hooked i was snorting those fake oxy 80s all the time and no one knew, I acted normal. Now for the last 2-3 months when I decide to do opiates (i guess i was/am still psychologically addicted) I get too fucked up, because my tolerance wasn't like before, and instead of passing out or nodding, I act fucking erratic, loud, I talk to myself etc, and I grunt a lot make weird fucking noises, my friend who recently quit has had to ""trip sit"" me many times after we would score.. Cause id act fucking crazy and start talking to myself, talking to strangers ETC and in my head I would think that im acting normal!!! 

TLDR: When I do opiates like H or fentanyl and get too fucked, instead of nodding/acting very sleepy and down, I act the complete fucking opposite. I literally act like a crazy person, sometimes hitting myself in the face, talking to myself, its like im on shrooms or some shit. Theres a threshold now from euphoric opiate normal buzz where I am contempt and happy and if i put in some effort nobody knows I am on opiates... to, crazy maniac talking to myself, sweating heavily etc etc. Is this common? do some people act energetic/crazy do weird shit when they do too much H or some shit???",1508260613.0

Hoping y'all can give me some advice. I'm sick of the lifestyle in general. I hate the financial strain, waking up sick, getting needled 24/7 by friends and family and never accomplishing anything constructive because of all the time I lose looking for dope and also not being able to focus. I don't even get high anymore so this shit doesn't hold up in terms of cost-benefit. I don't think I'm ready to get completely clean for good, I just want to get my life back on track and get my tolerance down to a reasonable level where I'm not going to get sick if I go not than 8 hrs without anything and am also able to get high without dropping a ton of money. I need to be functional at work and don't have enough money to take time off so cold turkey is a no go. I also am terrible with giving in to cravings so I'm scared of going completely sober.

 I want to get on to a maintenance program and taper down. My options are either methadone or suboxone. Methadone is covered completely so it'd cost me nothing where as subs would run me ~$100/week. I've heard methadone to be a bit more enjoyable than subs too which might fight some cravings.

I'm actually feeling ok, not really physically super sick but mentally I'm having a really rough time. I took 2 mgs of subs last evening at like 7 pm but I know subs have a stupid long half life. Before I was forced to quit I was shooting 1 g at a time. If I do .5 I should be fine and even with the subs catch a high. I'm just worried about going back to day 1 wds. Any thoughts? Other than ""don't do it."" I know that already.








**Edit:** I don't think anyone cares but I thought I'd update. I relapsed, if you can even call 5 days clean a significant enough amount of time to ""relapse"" from. It was the longest I'd gone without dope in almost a year though so I felt pretty good about it. I *wanted* to wait until tomorrow so that it would be a full 48 hours since I took 2mgs of Suboxone but I shot .5 as soon as I got home. /u/pyr088, you were kinda right. I didn't get that intense rush I was looking for but I got a little rush, the fuzzy blanket and a little nod. I still have .5 left so I'm going to wait until Friday or Saturday to do that. That way I'll have 4 days clean again and hopefully that half g will really get me where I want to be. Jury is still out on the wds though. We'll see tomorrow :/",1508257725.0

If you want to get clean, you can do it.","I used to frequent this sub often. I was a junkie making 50k a year and spending all of it on dope and Coke. I lived at home with my parents and every dollar went to getting high. I was banging 1.5g of good Midwest dope or 12-15 bags of Chicago dope every day, and snorting a half gram of clean Coke.

I have had a few slip ups in the beginning, and it's not easy. But if you want it, you can do it. I got on suboxone for a while and it really helped. But I knew that had to come to an end and it did, I take 6g of kratom a day and I have to quit that also. 

I did it without any rehab, if you have enough willpower you can too. I'm not here to preach saying you need to get clean because I didn't until I was ready and had already destroyed my life. Just know that you can quit when the time comes. I thought I was different because I worked 60-70 hours a week but that's not true, we're all in the same boat just different phases.

Anyways I hit him up, gave him my order, he tells me come through to an address he texts me. Ok cool. It's not far from the normal spot so so head over. He has me text him 5 minutes before I get there like usual, which I did. He texts me back that he's gonna have his brother meet me, he's wearing all black and he's  in the back of the Appt complex. There is actually a movie being shot on the street and cops are around so that's why he wanted me to circle around to the back. 

I cruise in, see dude in all black he waves me down. We make the trade and he just starts walking away and I'm like let me check this hold on. He kept walking and I felt the bag and it just didn't feel right.  It was in a blunt wrapper bag, the the.flour and peanuts (wtf haha) were in plastic bag made out of a grocery bag. Typical shit. The dude turns the corner and is gone by the time I untie the plastic bag too see like 4 grams of flower and the peanuts. I was pretty pissed but these are all trap dudes or whatever the fuck you wanna call me so I just gotta chalk it up to the game. It's my fault I got to comfortable and shoulda had him show me it before I gave up the money. Just glad it wasn't a shit load of cash orrrrr Im glad ai wasn't sick omg then I woulda been pissed.

It's a schedule iv and it's garbage but nevertheless even tramadol at high doses can give very stoned high. It's a strong opioid at higher doses yet because it's weaker than oxy or hydrocodone mg wise they deem it schedule iv and call it less potential for abuse.

What a joke.

The DEA trying to intervene creates so much more harm by adding apap to a drug some people may need 6-10 per day to get relief from which is not good for the liver.

Tramadol has a high seizure risk and is also a Norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor which is just dumb and stupid for a drug that's supposed to be an opiate.

Weeks later the package shows up, and they are Oxy 40's and 80's in factory blister packs, serialized etc. They looked super legit (from the image in the text msg) **except** the pills were utterly white with only a single E inscribed on one side.

No 40 nor an 80 on the other side denoting strength or *anything*. He snorted a bit from each batch but nothing. No buzz or shit.

He managed, *eventually*, to get most of his money refunded via the card company, don't ask me how. It completely broke him financially, though, as he was hoping to flip them and get his cash back.  He even called me 20 miles away broke down out of gas and no money, to help him, he was that broke. I felt bad for him and gave him some money to tide him over until he got his card refunded.

After searching the internet there are a shitload of posts about these things. I can't remember the name they were supposed to be from - the manufacturer. I think it's something like Abrexa.
They just looked *extremely* legit from the outside.

So be warned. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.",1508377025.0

My buddy and I were feeling good.  Got a nice bag delivered to the house.  It wasn't very much.  Each of us did a little over a point.  I knew this shit was good.  The best stuff I've seen in a very long time.  The first time I did this new batch was a few days ago.  I was alone and did a little over two points myself.  I almost overdosed that time, actually probably did.  I lost consciousness for a little while.  I even called my guy freaking out cause I thought it was cut with something else.  That's how good it was.  

              So anyways I got my shot in and he got it a little after me.  All he got out was ""holy shit, good stuff"". Before he fell back into his seat.   He seemed okay for a few seconds then stopped responding to me.  He was sitting In his seat and I was slapping his face trying to get him to respond.  He then proceeded to fall out of his seat and onto the floor.   That's when I called 911.  I gave them my address and they had me start performing cpr. (During CPR I was looking for the rest of his shit cause I didn't want him to have it on him while he was at the hospital in case the cops showed up.  I found his scale at least but not the dope.)  

                I have no idea how long it took them to show up.  Apparently the call lasted 7 minutes.  When they did show up my roommate answered the door and tried sending them away cause she thought it was the wrong house.   They took over and I left my room.  My roommate was freaking out more than I was and started crying while I hugged her.  I told the paramedics that he went into the bathroom and when he came back into my room he was acting weird.  I also said that I quit using dope like a week ago. They wheeled him to the ambulance and by the time he was in there apparently he was awake and talking.  I'm willing to bet he's gonna be pretty pissed with me when he gets out, but who gives a shit?  At least he's not dead.

                  This is the second time I've had to give someone CPR because of an overdose.  The first time was even worse because we were at my dealers house, it was my best friend who was od'ing,  and no one would fucking call 911.  With that one I eventually decided to just drive him to the hospital myself. (Side note unconscious people are incredibly heavy.) He woke up just as I was walking out the front door with him.   Sorry for the long post everyone, I just had to tell someone this story.  I've lost two friends to this drug and I am so ready to quit doing this to myself. 

TL;DR My friend overdosed in my house and I called 911.   Performed CPR and he was okay by the time he was in the ambulance.",1508372997.0

I currently go to pain management and get 120 Vicodin every month (10mg) and 30 Morphine Sulfate (30mg) a month.

I‚Äôm just fucking done with it. I have my next appointment a week from tomorrow and I‚Äôm telling my doctor I‚Äôm done with them. If she wants to help me ween off I‚Äôm grateful, if not I‚Äôll do it myself. 

Detox/withdrawal is gonna suck. But I‚Äôve done it before. I‚Äôm going back to weed. It still helps to an extent with my pain and more importantly I won‚Äôt live in the fog that I am now. 

I would like to sincerely thank everyone who shares their stories of quitting and staying off of these stupid fucking drugs because it‚Äôs given me courage to do the same. It wasn‚Äôt until recently that I realized how deep in I was. Doing bumps at work and falling asleep in the bathroom that I would write off as ‚ÄúJust being tired, no big deal‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know what it is with me anymore. Or, maybe I do, but I just don‚Äôt want to admit it.

I‚Äôve been using opiates for about 3 years now. Started with pills, then H. I don‚Äôt shoot, which is my only saving grace at this point, because I know if I started shooting it would turn me into a completely different person from the one that I am now, and I despise the person that I am now.

I used to love watching NBA basketball and playing it, too. I started using opiates after breaking my elbow playing basketball. Got started on pills, used for 3 months; stopped, didn‚Äôt use anything for about 6 months, and then for some reason just started again and didn‚Äôt stop. I haven‚Äôt played basketball for years. I used to play every single day. I used to look forward to the start of the NBA season every year starting WEEKS in advance. I‚Äôd be a little sad when the season ended. Guess what? The season opener was last night, and I didn‚Äôt even realize or know this until 10 pm last night.

It‚Äôs not just the NBA. It‚Äôs everything. I don‚Äôt play video games anymore. I‚Äôll buy them, and just never play them. It just doesn‚Äôt appeal to me. 3 years ago, I would play a lot and have immense fun doing it.

I don‚Äôt have any motivation anymore either. It‚Äôs just crazy. 

Oh, and the time thing. Holy shit. How is it October already? It‚Äôs 2017? What the fuck. I know time goes faster when you‚Äôre older, but it‚Äôs different for me. Every single one of my thoughts daily is based around whether I have enough dope, whether I have enough BitCoin to call my dboy (who is fucking unorthdox and makes me fucking pay him in bitcoin before he delivers even though he knows I‚Äôm not a cop nor will I flake on him; I‚Äôve bought from him for a long long time) or when I should use so that I get as high as possible.

Sorry for the long rant. I miss life pre opiates, I really do. I can‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù things anymore. It makes me so angry. I want to feel happiness, anger, even sadness. I don‚Äôt feel shit anymore. I don‚Äôt get angry anymore (anger is good from time to time- I let people walk all over me now, and the old Arnold would tear the person a new asshole.) oh, and let‚Äôs not getting into tearing assholes or vaginas or even mouths. Sorry for the language. I don‚Äôt give a shit about sex anymore, whereas before I would be thinking about girls a lot. Now, I just don‚Äôt care anymore.

Sorry for the long rant. I really hope it‚Äôs the opiates. As for stopping/rehab/quitting, I can‚Äôt get past the withdrawal. I get to day 3/4, and it just starts hurting way too much. Suboxone makes it worse for some reason or gives me insane migraines. 

Plus, I have one other reason why I‚Äôm so scared of getting clean- having to go back to pre-opiate addicted Arnold and realizing all the shit I‚Äôve done. The money I‚Äôve lost, the friendships I‚Äôve ruined, the relationships sabotaged, the time lost, the fun missed out on. That‚Äôs the worst part of it all.

Because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to cope with that. I‚Äôm afraid the realization of it all in a clean state will literal cause me to lose my mind.",1508355889.0

The drugs dont work anymore. Everything just feels fuzzy, sickly cold and grey. I hate waking each morning in a panic state due to a self-inflicted wound. A chemical imbalance off the scales caused by my own doing. Opiates. Coke. Amphetamines and all other flavors of downers too. Who would've thought gaba agonists would turn out to be my downfall?

Over the years I would try to kill him, in different ways.
------------------------------
My dad came to get me out of a crack house at 6 on a Monday morning, because I had not been home since I left a week before to take the last exam of senior year.  He knew I had his bike, and my girlfriend told them where I was.  That week, she and I made out on the red brick steps of her mom‚Äôs front porch.  I smoked a Marlboro light and told her I had some heroin.  She pressed her lips together and opened her eyes big, as if to say, ‚ÄúOkay?  What do you want me to say about that?  That is scary.‚Äù

The rest of the time I spent at Alex‚Äôs while my girlfriend finished junior year.  I couldn‚Äôt believe it the first time the sun rose on Alex and me that week.  Only minutes passed since we started doing lines of cocaine and heroin, partying in his basement apartment the night before, but then the sun rose through the window.  Powders in my nose and smoke in my lungs turned on biochemical faucets in my head.  My body buzzed and skin tingled with euphoria.  We looked at each other in surprise and laughed in the warm light coming through the window.  The night was gone, and we would never get it back.  Now the week was gone.  Years later Alex died of an overdose. Then his life was gone, and he never got it back.

Before I woke up that Monday morning I recognized my father‚Äôs voice coming from the door.  It was steady, like he collected himself and repressed his panic a moment before he knocked.  He came to take me back home.  The drugs I smoked and snorted the night before still swirled bliss in the black behind my eyelids.  A hand touched my shoulder.  The urgent whispers of a figure in the dark startled me awake.  Where was I?

‚ÄúRiley.  Riley.  Wake up.  Your dad is here.  You have to go.‚Äù


My father grabbed his bike and loaded it into the Landcruiser, so I told Alex,

‚ÄúTurn on the light.  I have to find my heroin.  I had 5 foils last night.‚Äù  The filament burned my retinas, and my brain shuddered before my hands shielded my eyes.

‚ÄúAre you sure?  I don‚Äôt remember that.  Where is it?‚Äù

I searched my pockets and found a tin foil bindle of white powder cocaine, but I wanted my heroine.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.  Let me check the couch.  I know I had them smoking crack with Cole last night.‚Äù  We pulled up the cushions and found nothing.  Then my father stood at the door.  The engine of his 1983 land cruiser ran in the dark outside.

‚ÄúCome on, Riley, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo with your dad.  Call me later.‚Äù  Alex switched the light back off.  From across the street, concrete crosses of graves made silhouettes against a dead pale sky.  It was a familiar sight for me by then.  My father never said anything in the car, at least nothing I can remember.

At the house, my sisters and mother dressed and got ready for school like any other Monday morning. I walked up to the third floor, and my skin crawled in desperation.  Sobriety was unacceptable.  I wanted to die or be sedated.

I laid the foil of cocaine under the lamp on my bedside dresser.  It looked like a gram and a half of coke, but when I gummed it and rubbed it on my lips, it didn‚Äôt numb me up.  The cocaine was no good, so I chopped all of it up and snorted it in one line.  It burned badly, but as soon as it hit the back of my throat, I knew it was several times a lethal dose of heroin, the stuff we called China white.

I walked downstairs to my get some juice.  My father cooked breakfast, and the smell of bacon fat filled the kitchen.

‚ÄúPoppa, I want some orange juice.  Can we go get some?‚Äù  He poked the bacon popping in the frying pan.  His left hand rested in his pocket, and I looked around in the refrigerator door open.

‚ÄúNot right now.  Go upstairs and go to sleep in the TV room.‚Äù

10 minutes later my little sister found me.  Green vomit covered my clothes and most of the couch.  The dying blood in my face turned my complexion gray, and my eyes rolled all the way back into my head.  She ran to get my father who had returned from buying orange juice.

As a veterinarian he knew how the basics of keeping something alive, so he got on his knees and pumped my chest with his hands.  A large glob of brown snot ejected from my nostrils, but vomit still blocked my airway.  He sucked it into his mouth and spat it out to help me breathe.  With bile on my lips, he put his mouth to mine and blew in breath.  He could have breathed for me for days, but the amount of heroin in my system meant certain death.

On a Monday morning before school, my sisters waited on the front porch for the ambulance.  My mother shook, doubled over in the doorway and watched her husband attempt to keep her only son alive.  My father breathed for me and pushed on my chest.  I lay on the ground dying like I wanted.  My respiratory system would shut down, and soon my heart would quit pumping.  17 years into this life and I was already on my way out.  How could I do that to my mother and father?  How could I do that to my sisters?  How could I do that to myself?








When I was a kid, my father used to ride bikes with me down the levee to throw rocks into the river at sunset, and during his workdays, he packed me around in the passenger seat of his Landcruiser while he made calls to clients.  Everywhere we went everyone knew him and wanted his attention.  They said, ‚ÄúHey, Doc!  Hey, Doc!  Hey, Doc!‚Äù  We went to different horse barns and properties throughout the countryside.  One night we hooked a chain to his front bumper and tried to pull a dead calf out of its mother as it got dark outside and afterwards he let me have a sip of his beer in the back of the Landcruiser.  I used to ask him every question I ever had, and he always knew the answer.  He was the smartest man in the world.

At some stables, he pointed and said, ‚ÄúA horse kicked me in the knee, and I cried under that tree.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt believe him, because my dad never cried.  At his clinic he was in charge of everything and everyone.   One evening while visiting the bayou a man got shot in the head in a hunting accident.  I watched my dad suck the bloody foam out of his throat, until help came.  The guy eventually died, but not while my dad was working on him.

The first time it occurred to me that I really loved him and he loved me, I was 4 years old.  He led me on a horse through a gate into a riding ring when I thought it.  One time I had an awful cough, and he stayed up with me to give me medicine and make sure I was okay.  My very first memory is on his hairy chest, waking from sleep, to choke back chunks of vomit in my throat.   He took a break from putting together some crawler or toy for me to drink a beer and read on the chase lounge under a lamp.  I was his only baby boy once upon a time, and he held me in his arms.

But now he knelt over me and pumped my chest with both of his hands and breathed for me, while he waited for the ambulance he hoped would come fast enough to save me.







The paramedics and firemen tried to get me to walk downstairs to the ambulance and go to the hospital, but I tried to bite them.  In the ER, I spewed green vomit all over the floor and ripped the IVs out of my arm to get water out of a sink.  It was Children‚Äôs Hospital, and young children were dying in the beds around me.  It was an ordeal, but I survived.

Whether it was an attempted suicide by overdose or not, I did not know, but everyone seemed to think it was.  I would have rather died than deal with the problems waiting for me on the other side of surviving.  My mother‚Äôs father, Turkey, sat in a chair next to me, and I gave him a hard time about them not allowing me any water.  I asked him if he wanted me to vomit in his mouth.

He laughed.  I was his oldest grandchild, and he called me Turkey like I called him Turkey.  He used to wake up before the sun to drink vodka in the 1970s, but in that hospital room, he had 28 years sober.

How to spot it?,"Hey guys, using a throwaway here. I'm looking for a bit of advice as I'm totally in the dark about this subject and I, of course, turn to Reddit for just about everything. I am sorry if this is the wrong place to post but I'm hoping I might get some reassurance. Also, sorry in advance for the wall of text. 

Long story short, I'm a bit suspicious that my boyfriend might be getting high on something (which drug in particular - I have no fucking idea) but I also don't want to jump to conclusions. On a few different occasions, he has shown up to my apartment and I can tell that his eyes are...well...off. In general, his eyes aren't huge or anything but in these specific instances, I've noticed that his pupils are much smaller (like, the definition of ""pinpointed') and just overall glossy. He seems a bit chattier but also kinder/soft-spoken in these moments. 

I have never mentioned this to him before until last night -
when I decided to call it out. Without saying it head on, I alluded to the fact that I thought he might be on something. He didn't flip out, per se, but definitely became very defensive and claims he has no idea why his eyes might do this. Said I'm totally imagining things/how the hell could I think he was getting high before seeing me on a random weekday/etc...We've had a few rough days lately with fighting and such so when this all blew up, he just ended up leaving my apartment and going home (which I was totally okay with). 

On a day to day basis, he does get very tired often and I've usually just attributed this to the fact that he has a manual labor job that requires him to get up super early - and this very well may be the reason. He has a history of depression and has openly told me this, but tbh I'm not entirely sure the severity of it (sometimes I'm scared it's worse than he makes it out to be). 

Am I jumping to conclusions? I've never dealt with this before so I don't want to be accusing my boyfriend of getting high behind my back without any facts. I really care about him and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do when my gut is telling me something might be weird. For reference, we've been seeing each other since this past winter/spring but our exclusive relationship is fairly new (~2 months).

Or fiction?","I say this because I really feel like once you have had an addiction, those thoughts will continue to haunt you for the rest of your life. I feel like thats the truth because I'm living it, everyday. I'm clean, for now, but I'm not gonna sit here and fucking lie that I don't dream about snorting oxys every night, and miss the way the world looks so much brighter when I'm high. Watching the sun set, looking at the leaves blow on a tree on a windy day, listening to music, fuck, literally doing nothing and feeling amazing. 

I never thought I'd be able to stop using. Then I got pregnant, at the worst time in my life. A time where I would run to my pills or whatever I could get my hands on just to not be here for the moment, to cope, to try to understand, to not have to deal with my emotions. And I do feel a bit stronger not using while going thru this shit storm life has been throwing at me, but I still feel so weak. So weak knowing that I'm counting down the days till I have my son so I can take one of the pills I have stashed away for that exact day. So I can get high and ""really deal"" with my uncles suicide, or my grandpas cancer, or my crumbling cluster fuck of a relationship, being with someone who I don't love anymore, and who doesn't understand or appreciate me but I can't seem to leave because I don't like the feeling of being alone. Which is really fucking worse to have someone who is there and still feel so vastly alone. Isn't that worse than just cutting the fucking cord?

I come from a line of addicts, and I see my mother struggle with alcohol to this day. She Will go months without, then have a bad day, someone rubbed her the wrong way, and she goes on a binge. I hate to say it but I feel like I am my mother. I know how she feels, trying to stay strong, trying to take it one day at a time, but sometimes, life gives us too much. So we run to what comforts us, for the moment. That moment is short lived, but oh so worth it at the time. I can't judge anyone because I'm no better. I understand why its so hard to quit, I fucking get it. 

I feel so depressed and lonely sober. I feel like I can't handle life, I miss the pills so much. I miss feeling carefree and loved and whole. I never thought everything I've ever wanted in my life would come to me thru an addiction. I never thought I'd feel like being an addict made me a better, more lovable person. I fucking hate opiates, but I love them at the same time. I could take this sobriety stretch and lengthen it after I'm not pregnant anymore, or I can run to what I know and love, to deal. And thats a choice I struggle with every fucking day.

So, I had some leftover codeine (around 144 mg, but some likely got lost during the extraction) however because of the rather low dose (that amount doesn't seem to do too much for me anymore), during the peak of the high, I decided I would have some wine. This was around two hours after dosing. Maybe thirty minutes later, I had some more, and noticed that somehow I was feeling less intoxicated and less sedated the more I drank. So all in all, spaced out around 2-3 hours or so, I had one glass of wine, maybe a little more, and keep in mind, I have barely any opiate tolerance and I'm not the biggest drinker either.  FYI, wine was 14% Cabernet Sauvignon.

This is when I started feeling the effects. I was very tired, feeling pretty drunk, and had a hard time breathing. Every time I tried to relax or close my eyes it felt like I was barely breathing, so I thought, hell no, not dying in my sleep. Eventually of course (it was late) I fell asleep, and now, here I am, alive but feeling as dead as can be. I'm still very tired and still have that frustrating chest tightness, and honestly, still feel kinda drunk.

I'm probably overreacting, but would still feel better knowing if this combo truly was too much.

My bare mattress sat against the wall.  Trash and old food stunk, scattered across the floor.  A heavy comforter hung from the curtain rods, and in the corner a reading lamp sat on top of an unplugged TV.  It was the only light in the room and focused on the only things that mattered to me: a spoon, a syringe, a lighter and some empty baggies on top of the TV.  Cigarettes and hot spoons melted the top of the TV while I dug around in my forearm searching for a vein.  Sometimes I sprayed the bloody water on the walls.

My room matched my head, rotting trash strewn everywhere, curtains stained with bodily fluids, stink and neglect.  It was full of a black sickness and wherever I went, I painted everything the same color.  Things could be going well, but it would not be long till I turned my life into a mushroom cloud and everything around me into rubble.  Once again, those who loved me would be left to shield their eyes from the shockwave of dust, brains and shrapnel that would otherwise hit them in the face.

I loved to make a mess.

I read James Joyce, Steinbeck, as much of Kurt Vonnegut as I could, Tom Robbins and everything else.  I read an 800-page biography on Che Guevara and idolized his socialist ideology and devotion to the cause.  He probably would have killed me for being a lazy, white, drug addicted American, but that didn‚Äôt matter to me.  When I read that people were upset at the executions he oversaw after the revolution, I didn‚Äôt understand.  Deep down, I knew that no one‚Äôs life had any more inherent value than the fish or bacteria from which it evolved, so why would executions offend me?  

Our greatest purpose was to die as transitional forms, evolving to perfect the species.  I wondered if some future museum might display a life-sized replica of me in my habitat, like we have for cavemen, today.  It would be made of fiberglass and plaster mold.  My dwelling would be behind a dumpster.  My shoes would be wet, and instead of prehistoric tools, there would be a lighter and a spoon in my hands, a dirty syringe behind my ear.  I would represent a failed branch of the evolutionary process, a momentary glitch in mutation expressing a fatal genetic trait: Auto-Cerebral Cannibalism.  Luckily only the fit survive, and I wasn‚Äôt it.

Auto-Cerebral Cannibalism.  I imagined myself sitting at a table and eating my own brain like a melon with a spoon, but that did not adequately convey the inner horror.  The grainy visual of my own brain somehow eating itself was getting closer, but the image of my brain devouring me from the legs up with all the blood and ferocity of an oversized piranha was the only image that seemed sufficiently heinous to me.  The thoughts and beliefs in my own mind were destroying me.  Even though I didn‚Äôt know how they got there or even what they were, they vehemently and violently opposed me.  At least part of it was that I hated myself for being white, male, educated and American.  You see?  I rejected my father and all that he was, but you can‚Äôt reject your father without rejecting yourself.  So I did, and it would kill me.  That was okay though.  It would be a favor to the world.

I thought it was like max six months and more like three. But then he says ""there is a way to cheat the system."" He says Vivitrol is basically naltrexone in a monthly time release injection, but it is an antagonist and blocks the receptors to help with cravings and prevent relapse, but then he goes on to say that it raises your natural endorphin levels back to that of a ""normie"" or normal non-drug user which is supposed to help with PAWS. But all the reading I've done and all the literature I've looked through never mentions jack shit about that last part of raising your natural endorphin level back to that of a normal non-user without waiting months for the receptors to repair and the pain to adjust back. 

Is anyone on Vivitrol or taking Naltrexone daily. Can you confirm or deny the last part? It seems like bullshit. Naltrexone is just an orally active form of naloxone, so just an antagonist on the opiate receptors. I don't see how this would affect your homeostasis of natural endorphins.",1508450850.0

But the dboy said he had a connect for powder and it was great but obviously way more expensive. So I bought some, and I think the shit is bunk, but I have no way to know. 

I don't shoot, so I tried snorting it and it tore my sinuses up instantly. Like severely agitated them. The smell / taste I guess could be compared to bunch of pencil erasers, rubber like, band-aid smell which doing some research is the expected smell for no 4? But it doesn't effect me. I still went into withdrawal and finally caved and took a sub to mitigate the suffering. Had I snorted no 4, the sub should have sent me into precipitated WD, but it didn't which further leads me to believe its garbage. 

The next day I tried again snorting; same thing instantly triggered my sinuses to close up  and no feeling. I dissolved it in water and tried to boof it and it was unlike BTH. It just seemed caustic so I crapped it out after a minute (funny now, but horrible when you are in WD).

Dboy said he shot the stuff and it was incredible. He has never screwed me over before and hooks up the best quality of my connections, but like I said if I was still getting sick trying this shit out and a sub didn't make me worse, I have to assume its garbage. Yet the color, consistency, taste / smell seem to line up with what people say no 4 is like. Am I doing something wrong? I don't have a chemical regent or I'd test it. I've also experienced PWD, so if the sub would have triggered it I would have known. 

I have no experience with powder due to region. Am I just using a bad RoA? No way in hell would I try and shoot this crap.

Properties: white powder, small chunks. Looks very similar to wikipedia picture: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Heroin_asian.jpg/1024px-Heroin_asian.jpg

I know no 4 is supposed to be shooting H, but that cannot be the only valid RoA. ",1508448074.0

So, when I woke up this morning around 9 I didn‚Äôt really have any plans besides going to class later. I didn‚Äôt have any oxy so I knew today was just going to get worse and worse. Woke up feeling nauseous(still am nauseous) so I just got something small on my stomach and messed around on reddit for about an hour when one of my best friend calls me. We‚Äôll call him Rex

‚ÄúYo man, where you at‚Äù-Rex
‚ÄúI‚Äôm at home. Why wassup?‚Äù-me
‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Adam, Daisy, and Mitch. They were gonna fire us up if you wanna partake‚Äù-Rex
‚ÄúYea man I‚Äôm not doing shit. You all can come on‚Äù-me
I‚Äôm thinking to myself *I might as well go. I‚Äôm not gonna be doing shit. And I only had around 5$ so no weed or oxy. Might as well go get lifted*

So I get up, take a piss and brush my teeth and get dressed and head out. We go cop some weed. Smoke a few blunts and everyone is high as fuck at this time, when Mitch says ‚ÄúHey guys I gotta go to work‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôll drop you off man‚Äù Rex says and we start heading out. Now Rex usually has car problems and he and i have been stranded a good 3 times this year. Some nagging feeling was telling me to go home but Daisy said she was going to cop some more weed after she picks up her tips (she works near by Mitch) but for lack of better judgement I agree to ride. 

So we get to the Northside (the rich side) and pull up to this apartment complex by Mitch‚Äôs job. (This apartment complex despite being in the beside neighborhood in the city maybe the whole state is this ghetto as high rise. You can find coke, H, pills, every thing in there) so we get there. Daisy gets out and goes up stairs to cop, while Adam, Rex, Mitch and I chill in the car. She comes out about 5 min later when Rex puts it in drive. The car makes a clunky noise but starts up finally. Rex tries to turn the wheel when the steering column is locked. *FUCK!! I knew I should have stayed home.* Stranded going through WD wasn‚Äôt something I wanted to experience. Rex kinda got the wheels turning a little bit but the car wasn‚Äôt making any sharp turns. 

Rex decides to pull around back because there is NO WAY we are making it back to the south side, about 30min away like this. We‚Äôre pulling around the building when a guy coming out yells out ‚ÄúHey guys! Your radiator is leaking‚Äù. We get the car to the back, and Rex good out and slams the door, ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù He‚Äôs yelling and honestly I‚Äôm thinking the same thing. (Rex sorta has anger issues). He walks around and we‚Äôre just sitting in the car talking. 

Daisy decides to roll her weed, especially since we have nothing better to do. So, we roll up when Rex comes back to the car (probably about 15 min at this point). He says he has a tow truck on the way but only 2 people can ride. Mitch is going to work but we still need to figure a ride for 2 people. When Daisy says she has to be at work at 2. 

Now, while we were smoking the blunt putting our heads together I mention I have some credits on uber acc. Daisy mentions she has to go to work at 2. So she asks if I can take the bus and I give her an uber. I‚Äôm thinking *i was kinda reserving that for school next week, but I get paid tomorrow and shit I can get high today* so hell yea I agree. So Daisy & Mitch walk back to the front where the bus stop is, also where the uber will be coming. I thanked them for the altitude and chilled until the tow truck is almost there and then walked to the bus stop. 

I just got off the train. Now I know today could have been a lot worse! We could have been on the side of the highway it‚Äôs a miracle we made it as far as we did. Even though I need to stop to lower my tolerance i was able to get 2/20 IRs (I got one on credit. My guys whole family loves me. His mom would throw me free stuff when he was locked up.)

So that‚Äôs it guys. I‚Äôm heading home now. Well gas station to cop a brew and some loosies then I‚Äôm on the way home. I forgot my head phones so I started this story in my notes when I got on the train. Been typing ever since

Thanks for attention

Last year a family friend who's family has always been close with mine stole $500 from his parents vacation fund. They're pretty well off and barely go on any vacations so he didn't think they would notice for a long time and by then he would be able to cover it up. So he calls me up and we use the money to do speedballs for the next two days. Nothing comes of it and I assume everythings cool. Just yesterday my parents call me and... *drum roll* ... his parents realized the money way gone, searched his room, found all of his rigs and stash (they didn't know he was a junky) and then put 2 and 2 together. He comes up with some terrible cover story about how it was one of my friends who was over and stole it. His parents are hanging out with mine and it comes up and something clicks in their minds and they figure out I'm also pretty far down the rabbits whole. I guess all of the shady shit about my appearance, money problems and what not finally make sense to them and they call me out on it. For whatever reason my parents are convinced the cover story is b.s. and know we stole the money to get high so they've ostracized me. I don't think they plan on pressing charges which is good but my relationship with my parents is broken which feels terrible. The shame knowing I've let my family down is really shitty, especially my grandma and extended family who didn't have any idea I was such a shit person. Oh well, at least I have enough dope to not have to deal with who I am for a while. So anyway, what's your most shameful story? When did you stop pretending you were in anyway, a decent person?

Edit: we didn't buy speed boats, although I wish we did.

Edit 2: I guess this isn't my most shameful story. I think I only feel so bad because I got caught and it fucked my life up. The worst thing I think I've done is steal like ~20 30mg Hydromoprhcontin, a handful of dillies, and like 10 100mg morphine pills from the medicine cabinet of one of my dad's friends who was dying of cancer. It's not so bad because they had hundreds of each and didn't regularly take any of them so its not like they suffered cause of me, its just a really greasy way to get pills. I can't help myself from looking in any medicine cabinet I come across and when I saw the huuuuggee bottle of hydros I couldn't resist. The person later died and my dad ended up getting all of their stuff because they didn't have any other friends or close family. My dad doesn't know what the pills are other than the morphine so I've been taking a couple every time I go over there. I guess I didn't really hurt anyone, I just hate the feeling of getting high because someone else was suffering. ",1508435415.0

Most days I have the realization of our situation locked down - I can push it down and not acknowledge it. Today, on the other hand, not so much.

I've been feeding the dogs people food which they, of course, love but can't do it anymore - it's just getting too costly. The small bag of dog food is like $5 and the big bag is like $7.50. I've managed to gather change and almost make $5 but I can't see spending it on what amounts to a single day's worth of food and tomorrow they'll be out again.

Sorry but I've got to rant a bit. i've been trying to get FEMA out to the house and just can't fucking seem to do it. Everyone around me is getting their checks and we haven't even received a visit nor inspection. I got water running in my bathroom when it rains if the tarp blew off, siding that's torn down and while they're not helping, it's getting worse. The old lady across the street that I've mentioned on here has a similar problem - can't get them out to her place. I bought her a tarp and covered the bad section of roof with it for her so at least she wouldn't be ruining her stuff but her patience is wearing thin as well.

I know they have a lot of people to help. Again, I'm just ranting.
