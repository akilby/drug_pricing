Fuck. So I look inside, lights off, no one waiting. Fuck! I call the office to see if maybe they were breaking for lunch. No answer. FUCK! I wait in the parking lot for about 30 minutes and continuously call the office, but it's no use. Why in holy hell would they schedule me an appointment for when their office is fucking closed?? Now I'm down to one strip and since New Year's Eve/day falls on a Thursday and Friday this year, there's no hope of getting a refill until Monday. Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else? And what are we supposed to do in situations like these? In the contract I signed for my doctor when I started the program it stated that I can't get any narcotics prescribed from another doctor while I'm in this program or I'll be dropped from the program. So does that mean I just have to be sick all weekend because they fucked up? Please give me some advice. I don't think it's going to come down to me having to go to the hospital or anything. But I'm used to taking two strips a day and now I have to make 1 strip last for 3 days. I need a miracle!

So I have come here for some input/suggestions. To clarify, I'm currently attending a clinic to get my suboxone. (It's oddly uncommon and somewhat unlikely to get yourself a script here in the red state of Idaho) however, I must commute 45-60 miles each day to dose every day of the week. Often, this is simply not a viable option. I don't get sick without my dose, some withdrawal, but only some lethargy/fatigue and lack of motivation. So on occasions I will skip days due to my situational constraints. 

Most I've missed is 3 days, which is the time that I managed to overdose on it at work. Work is near the clinic, but two of my shifts are nearly 6 hrs after the clinic closes, and because I don't live in the city, sitting up here for hours with no place to go is not appealing, especially since I do not get sick (yet). Other attributing circumstances comes on days off, one of which is a day where the clinic is open for a single hour. My usual dose is 6 mg, but after a previous incidence of dosing too much after missed days, I had told them I only wanted a 2 mg dose since I had missed 3 in a row. They agreed, and dosed just the 2mg, because of what had happened before. To expand on my situation and dosing consistency, I had been missing an average of 2 doses for the previous 3 weeks. The days weren't consecutive so I had still been dosing 6 before this 3 in a row instance. 

After dosing the 2 mg, I was fine until the 3.5 hr mark, the point at which effects were peaking. While smoking a cigarette on my break, I became noticeably cloudy/sedated and somewhat dizzy. After prematurely putting out the smoke and walking inside, my stomach turned over and imminent vomiting became clear to me. I ran into the bathroom started violently expelling the water in my stomach. The fun part was that all the stalls were occupied, leading me to hurl into a trash can as 4 people watched from the sink and urinals. Haha. And of course the trash can was the type with a dog door type lid (common on public trash cans, idk if I described it well). So I was puking violently, loudly, and sexily while attempting to keep that open. 

This had happened before, so I shook it off thinking my condition would improve once I settled into the dose. I work 10 hour closing shifts at a call center, so I went back to my desk and began trying to work again. About 30 minutes later I had to rapidly walk out of the callfloor and to the bathroom where I once again got violently sick. At this point, it is getting worse instead of more comfortable. As the day continued, I ended up violently expelling my lunch about 10 seconds after finishing it, and for the rest of the day I would get sick about every 30-50 mins. 

After repeatedly informing supervisors of my condition and the cause of it, I was told to keep working since I was not vomiting non-stop. To which I agreed because I am still recovering financially from being a junkie. Eventually, it became so difficult to be productive that I requested early dismissal, offering to make it up to my supervisor if possible. This resulted in one final ""go lay down for 20 mins to rest and we'll see if it gets better"" which I did. Again, got violently sick and got off a whole 30 minutes early! The previous 7 trips to the bathroom in 7 hours didn't warrant sending me home apparently. 

In the end I became sick a total of 9 times between 1230 and 9pm. From just 2 mg. I am wondering if there is something to ease this reaction and the symptoms that are a result of it. I had thought dropping all the way down to 2 from 6 would be an appropriate dose. Jesus Christ was I wrong. I am wondering if it's at all likely that my inconsistency in the previous week's attributed to my alleged tolerance drop that occurred in the 3 days leading up to this. The clinic seemed not to believe me and said it was due to not being on a full stomach upon dosing, they also said it might have been pwds. Which I instantly negated because no opis are in my system and there was proof. They seemed to not believe my story and appeared to think I was exaggerating or overreacting, then blaming blame on me for being inconsistent. Which I was the one who brought it up, basically they gave me ambiguous responses until settling on the easiest explanation that I offered. 

TL;DR
I missed 3 doses (6mg) in a row and dropped down to 2mg to be safe. Starting at peak effect, I became violently sick, sedated, dizzy and nauseous for the entire work day, getting sick 9 times in 9 hours. I am wondering if this is an overdose, and if it's plausible that my tolly dropped that quickly? Also want to know if there is any form of remedy for this reaction to too high of dosage? Perhaps I am mistaken about the cause of it, if so what else would it be? Thanks homies, any help is appreciated. ",1451587214.0

I've been taking 8mg subs daily for about a month or so, buying them on the DNM's.  I've only got to make it through the 5th, whatever happens after that is fine, I want to taper, but if I have to cold-turkey I can, I've got tons of time off work coming.

The holiday mail and an exit scam has fucked me.  I ordered from 4 guys well in advance, but I'm down to my last strip.  I'm praying something comes in the mail today, but if it doesn't I'm fucked.  I skipped my strip yesterday and tried to use kratom instead, but I needed to eat so much(50+ grams yesterday) of that vile shit just to keep the w/d at bay.  I can't exactly run to the bathroom and eat a pile of that shit every 4 hours while at work.  The side effects get me and I always get a migraine from it, too.

I've never done heroin(always had access and money to afford pharms, not judging), and I wouldn't have the first clue on how and where to cop.  Not asking for sources, just telling you the sources(or lack thereof) that I have.

My current plan is to take a 1/3 of the strip for each of the next 3 days.  How sick am I going to be?  I need to be 100% these next days, I have tremendous pressure w/ work and a long distance move in the next 3 days.  Anyone have any other suggestions?

I have really bad pain in my feet and my fingertips. From what I have read about different kinds of joint pain, muscle pain etc it seems be neuropathic pain.

My GP confirmed this but he thinks that is caused by my serious anxiety disorder (I have a script for diazepam and alprazolam), and said it should go away if my mind is settled by getting a nerve specialist to test for neuropathy.

I went to the specialist and he said that the results were slightly abnormal, and he would give them to my GP and my GP would call me and proceed with treatment if he thought it necessary.

He never called and said that he does not think any treatment is necessary, and he said I should use my diazepam to ease my muscles the help the pain a little, but that is all. He does not think it is very serious...

The pain is getting quite bad and I don't know what to do since both my GP and a specialist appear to think there is nothing wrong; I am not deficient in anything as I maintain myself quite well.

I can't afford to purchase opiates illegally because even though I have connections for it, the price is simply too high for the reward, and I really don't think it is fair I should have to pay so much to self-medicate pain that is seriously affecting my ability to enjoy every-day life.

I've only ever been smoking, usually from this stuff after 100mg-150mg chased on foil with my low tolerance and infrequent use I'm noddin hard. However it takes me a while to get there...so I tried racking a line the size of a matchstick (I know this is more dangerous but foil also makes a lot of noise and i live with parents) and wow, 1.5 lines the size of a match stick had me rushing the same as maybe 100mg chased would have done.

I always thought they said you couldn't sniff #3, as it was freebase. What gives? Is what I'm sold possibly heroin #4 just cut with caffeine and mannitol for smoking or what? 

Thanks people!",1451724294.0

http://imgur.com/a/CCUw5

Just a friendly update from across the pond for my friends here :) 

**First of all, Happy new Junkie Year, and Happy Holidays!** 

My Heroin+Benzo career, and my Musical Endeavors, during this celebratory period, in a country that is totally collapsed, and on top of that, millions of Refugees choose to come to stay here. 

Generally as a peoples, we welcome them -greeks are not racists-, but it's ironic that those refugees chose Greece for their final destination. Like... gurl. 

Do you even see that in the public food services of our Socialist country, the rooms are full of greeks? Anyways. Hardships like these times, bring us together. This is something I know for a fact  :)

I realy wish everyone has a warm place to stay. But above all, even if the place is not warm (*and I have had my fair share of cold new year's eves in squats and/or abandoned buildings or ""buildings""*), it's the company that matters, **the humans**. People that have Heart, Empathy and are not paranoid or scumbags that will steal your heroin when you nod, not even leaving half a gram for you to last through the day to examine what to do..... 

Fucking scumbags.... They exist everywhere, but in our community, the unfortunately become our ""Mascots"" because society really wants to stereotype us this way. We become scapegoats. 

One day, all this will change. When everything will be legal, we will look back and laugh. Right now, we are like how gays were in the 1780s. A dangerous lifestyle that becomes dangerous because the society made it illegal. A false, mistaken, circularly-fucked-up logic. But things will change! They already have started to change. 

**Patience, comrades!**


----------------------------------------

Well, I don't know whether it's because my family is four (4) generations Atheists or whatever, but Junkie Jesus^^TM, never visits me. 

Even the holiday days are normal as always. Only exception is the money given to my as a gift by my grandma, my mother, and my aunt. 

They know very well where these money go, but maybe the fact that in 10-15 days I'm entering Methadone Maintenance, they're more relaxed. Who knows? They also know that I get seizures without my medicines, and they definitely do not wish to risk having an episode in the midst of the holidays. That's how much they love me.

Well, nothing special happened. Did not find any money on the street by accident. Did not got sold speed for heroin (meta from /r/drugs). Did not find heroin as I was walking down the street singing doo wah didi tiri tam tiri toom...

But also, nothing of bad luck happened! All in all, probably one of the best holidays of my junkie career.

My good friends are all in heavy depression mode, because they use MDMA very often, and they deplete their Serotonin. I hate MDMA. I use to do it 3 times per year, back in the days when it was pure, and even then, the depression afterwards made me quit it...

**PROTIP**: I gave them some Lyrica, light benzos (Bromazepam 3mg), Vitamin C, good company, and it alleviated their post-mdma depression. As I see how this medicine works (Lyrica), the more I am convinced it is a miracle drug. No wonder it's 30 euros per box. Thank lucifer for our NHS, I can get it for free.

These close friends do not use opiates or benzos at all, but they love me so much... 

They can't understand what a withdrawal can mean, but they try their best. 

They never alienated me. They've given me money without waiting me to return them. I payed them back via other methods. I lucked out, and I am happy and proud for my friends.



Regarding my Roma dealer, same-ol'e-same as always: All well (knock wood).

The only thing that is kinda negative is that I had some work (finally), and in combination with various money from relatives for holidays, *I upped my doses in Heroin AND Flunitrazepam*. It was really **not needed**, because in 5-6 days that my economic status will return to just 1 gram of H and 1 pill of 2mg Flunitrazepam per day, it will be a veeery hard week to get used to it again.

**My ""holiday habit"" as we speak is 3-4 grams of high quality (6.5/10 to 7/10) heroin per day**, and -unfortunately and dangerously- **5-6 pills of 2mg Flunitrazepam per day**, also. 

Especially regarding benzos, I have to titrate and not cut them again suddenly, or else Seizure Land, here I come again. And this time, I won't hit the lottery again. I'll surely die. I don't care about me dying, I care about my mom and how she'll be a shell of a human being...

Anyway, at least for now, I am having a blast. I feel like a car that has gas for all the duration of the day. I am very productive, and have an excellent normal mood for a Homo Sapiens: Going to cinema, talking with relatives (wow), hanging around with quality friends and people... etc.... etc...

I am writing my 6th record with a GREAT partner. I sing and write lyrics, and I didn't have someone to flesh-out the melodies that I have in my mind. Now I have him! He is French-Greek, he is straight, but we get along so well. I feel him like a brother. Who said that a gay boy and a straight boy can't be bros and best buddies? Fuck them!

Maybe it is the last time I am having a blast, since come January 12-15 I'm entering Methadone, so I think it is worth it.

**WRAPPING IT UP:**

As you can imagine and if you've seen ""*My Big Fat Greek Wedding*"", my belly is full of food. Excellent food and deserts, made by my grandma, my mom and aunt. Mediterranean diet. I took 14 (!!!!) kilos, and I look very healthy, and less junky-ish, even though my habit is bigger.

I'm still looking for a permanent job, because the singing gigs don't pay, and my freelance translating services do not pay well at all due to the economic collapse. Please do not say that I am a scumbag, but I cannot afford to pay my taxes. My taxes are LITERALLY larger sums than the money I take if I've had stated it legally. So, I get paid by my bosses illegally (no receipts), and since they don't have to gimme stamps, it's a win-win situation.

The government is leftist, and is on a hunt for the upper-middle class and rich people who do not pay taxes, and rightfully so. They can afford to pay their taxes, but they do not. We, the proletarians, simply cannot pay the new taxes. Period. Fullstop. End of story.

**Anyway, this is a huge wall of text**, but a lot of rad people here who I have close to my heart, have told me to do regular updates from across the pond. 

**Can't do them when I am in withdrawals, and can't be bothered to do them/forget to when I am very high.**

I only write updates when I am in this sweet spot where we feel good, normal, and we are functioning addicts. A ""sweet spot"", where, if Heroin was legal, it would be a more often occurrence, don't ya think?

KISSES from sunny Athens! Oh yeah, it IS sunny. We call is ""sun with teeth"", because even though there is not a cloud on the sky, the temperature for us feels low. For a northern person, it's a joke. I still see tourists with t-shirts (like, literally wtf?).

IV noob,"So, I've dabbled with Heroin for a little while, started IV'ing and that's been my ROA for the past 15-20 shots. I figure I'm a ways off from being addicted, but recently I've been considering if I'm already addicted to it.

A majority of the time I don't have any issues, but the past couple shots things have gotten strange. Usually about 10-15 hours after shooting I'll throw up multiple times. However, after I throw up I'm good and have no other problems (except for this morning)

At first I thought it was because I took too much, but last night I woke up (about 8 hours after I dosed) and vomited 3 times. I drank some water, a few minutes later I threw up the water. This kept happening until I stopped putting anything in my stomach and eventually got back to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling a little nauseous. I had copped some good up and decided to jump start my day with that. Snorted 2 little bumps and about 5 minutes later I was throwing up (I'm guessing from swallowing coke snot), drenched in sweat, and cold. And note I don't have jack shit in my belly at this point and am mostly dry-heaving or puking up bile (the coke vomit was green?)

I decided to shoot up to see if I could actually put something in my stomach, lo-and-behold I could. I feel fine. Is this just the H surpressing everything or am I actually sick and the H just made me better?

I really don't want to be sick, cause then I know I'm fucked.

TL;DR Was throwing up anything I put in my stomach, got sweats, headaches, and so on. Shot up some H and felt fine. First time it's been this serious, so just need to know if I'm sick.",1451668442.0

Despite doing all the normal things people are supposed to do, (career, save money, girlfriend, etc) I feel like I'm just going through the motions. I used, and felt that spark of life again. Now what?","I started getting high around 17, and at 23 was arrested at the end of a long run, and spent a few months in jail. Parents told me i was on my own, and i managed to get a program, get a career, and turn things around. For the first few years of being clean, i focused all my energy on turning my life around; i worked, saved money, went from having 4 roommates to having 2 roommates to now having my own apartment. I bought a car, have a retirement account, have a girlfriend, pretty much everything you could want when you're dope sick in jail and picturing what the future could be. 

I genuinely thought i had lost the urge to get high, and that i was just some spoiled kid who used because i was bored and had no motivation because my parents didnt make me work or pay bills. But 5 years later, I find myself completely unexcited by life. Most of my days i rush home from work, only to drink at home and cook dinner, and fall asleep on the sofa by 8pm. I'm cynical as fuck, i find i dont like people, i have no desire to chat and make friends or do activities with others. I'm arrogant, and i just withdraw into my own little world most of the time. 

When i used to get high, even though my life was a mess, I used to explore interests like photography; i would drive around in my parents car and take pictures all over my area, i would stay up late on photoshop editing them. I  have been using a bit lately, and for the first time in years i've felt that excitement about life, where I didn't feel like i was just passing the time. I'm not sure what to do about this, because i know that starting to use again is a horrible idea, and will only turn out bad in the end.

I went through a period of almost a year where I was using prescription opioids quite solidly. However, I quit about 3 months ago and although the withdrawal symptoms are gone, I am still dealing with some pain, depression, and anxiety. I have been informed that these symptoms are most likely post acute withdrawal syndrome. Upon investigating possible solutions for this condition, I came upon using naltrexone to straighten out my opioid receptor system. However, I was wondering at what dose of naltrexone and how long I should use it. I was thinking of several different approaches. Either go on a normal dose of naltrexone for a few weeks and then stop taking it or use low dose naltrexone for a wile. I was wondering if anyone has had experience with using naltrexone to fix post acute withdrawal syndrome and if so, how did you use it and for how long were you on it?

It subsided soon afterwards, but from then on she has run into comments from her rabbit friends that her jaw pops rather loudly when eating. 

This never happened so bad before, now I'm just wondering if it could have been dope that caused this or some strange cut?  

Anyother mammals run into this problem? 

I'm assuming it has to do with toxins being stored somewhere in that area.  
She also complains of a strange sensation just below her ear that hurts a bit, and slight ringing in her ears when she smokes tobacco, but that started before this.

I'm really a firm believer in trying to find some information that's already here before I just repeat something someone asked last week.  I haven't been able to find anything closely related to what I have going on, so any advice would be helpful.    
  My drug of choice is hydrocodone, about 200-300 mg a day.  About 2 months ago a friend had some bomb H so I tried it on foil, and felt that same awesome energizing warm fuzzy feeling that the hydro gives me, so I switched cuz it's way cheaper of course.    
  For a while it was all good, I only smoke it, and I could almost interchange it for a good amount of hydrocodone.  Both would give me the same high.  Now fast forward to a few days ago, the gear looks exactly the same (maybe lighter but you don't notice unless you really look) but it just wasn't doing it.  I figured it was cut, my friend did too, so we hit up the guy and he said he's getting a new batch. (I'm on the west coast if anyone was wondering) We pick that up and everyone says it's SUPER strong.  It's powder, very light brown color, and will gel up if you breath on it.  It will kill my dope sickness, but why can't I find that zone where I feel good and motivated to do chores and shit?  I go straight from sick as hell, to WD gone but not high, to sick from too much.  It's from the same connect, looks the same, and I'm doing the same amount.  My apologies if I sound like a dumbass and this is just the name of the game.

My personal info

.

Job:

I currently have a job. A good job doing exactly what I want to do with my life. Well kinda I know I want to do something with health care narrowed that down to pharmacy. My job is being a pharma formulator. Which means I make drugs for a living. I play around with the different amount of binders and fillers that go into each pill and blend them together maybe granulate depending on situation and press and package/bottle for clinical testing. I work for a contracting company so I handle 20 different projects a week and constantly am seeing new drugs and new machines and methods everyday so this is the perfect job to help build my resume and get some real good solid experience.

.



 I was thinking of doing an ama on here of something since I know a lot about pills but it wouldn't really be that interesting. I never handled any cool drugs but I know how to make them. I got my hands on some raw alp powder off the DNM and am just dreaming of the day I have to go in alone on a Saturday sbd can blend sbd press my own sticks but I would still need to buy my own dies and punches and I got off hand here. 

.


Drug usage:


But I'm wondering how do I go to rehab. I've got a gram a day habit that I was doing that by snorting but I manged to get clean for a week on subs before relapsing and picking up the needle. Now I do a bun (.7-.8) a day normslly shooting 3 times morning after work night and snorting at work to get by. I have my life holding together but on a string. I already got into 2 car crashes in the past few weeks. One I just taped the back bumper of the car and the other I hit the curb and got a flat but both because I was nodding before hand. One day I'm going to fuck up and seriously get hurt. 


 .

.


Previous attempts at sobreity:

.

I've tried subs and shit but I know nothing will work unless I actually take a time out and work on my issues through rehab. I don't think I can do kind of a after work rehab either. I need a month of no drugs and get it together. Any advise how people have done this do I quit my job? Put it off until my addiction gets worse and am fired? Keep trying to get sobreity on my own. I may go back onto subs on Tuesday but idk getting on subs from dope Is like when I tried to cold turkey 100mg oxy. I can't do that over the weekend I need to take time off but I keep relapsing.

Other mental issues.

        So lately ive been short on cash and for whatever reason i just cant bring myself to do anything that might remain on my conscious. I mean before it didnt matter what the circumstance was i didnt think twice about being a no good fucking terrible low down dirty grimy scum bag of a human being to get a fix. I dont know what changed or clicked but i like it. 

           Today i got 20 bucks from my sister. It was awesome because i was broke and had no prospects of money and those withdrawals were starting to really kick in ( 24-30hrs w/o). So i leave my house and call the dboy up to see whats good. No answer. Shit. Fuck. please not one of theses days. Call again. Nothing. Well fuck it im just gonna head that way and hope he calls back.. 

         Im about 5 min away from his place and sure as shit he calls me back. Im all stoked now and already feeling better just knowing that im gonna score. I get there and hes outside already. Fuck yeah! He jumps in i get my shit and take off. It looks like a .3 of bth i was even more ecstatic because it looked hooked up. 

         I couldnt wait to do it so i pulled around the corner (well a few corners) cooked it up, registered, and pushed it in.  Im waiting for the rush to hit me because this is about 2x what i normally do. All i got was a weak rush. Fml. 

        I start trying to think of something to do. Anything. I read a post on here about some guy spilling his shit on his pants then putting it in water, ringing it out into a cup, and drinking it. Ive got this bandana that i always cooking my shit on not to make a mess and its covered with spills and brown spots from weeks of shots.  So i soak it,  ring it out into a cup,  and then reduce the volume to maybe 3 shots worth.

        I do the shot not expecting much more than a tiny feeling if anything. All of the sudden it hits me like a freight train. One of the most amazing rushes ever. I was amazed that it even remotely worked. Thank you junkie jesus. So now ive got two more left :) and im posting this to share. Nothing too miraculous but i thought it was pretty cool.

now, my connects are running dry. One dude I get dilaudid from is moving, and the other does't have access to it for the time being. not to mention I'll be leaving in a week. I won't even be able to being any back with me.

I'd assume no one's screaming it from the rafters, but hey, we all live different lives! Ha ha. My question basically excludes anyone you have strictly opiate dealing relationships with (d-boys or middlemen that you probably wouldn't be friends with otherwise). Anyway, here's my situation: Very, very few people know I'm an active user. 

1. I have one bff that I used to get high with all of the time, she knows (and occasionally par takes) about me using Kratom, pills, and subs, but she has no idea that I've become a mainly dope guy OR how often I use. 
2. I have another friend who occasionally middles for me, but again, he thinks it's only pills and only when he provides them for me (once a month or so).
3. Other than that, I have one friend which I have a fairly murky relationship with. He's, I guess, slightly bisexual as we hooked up once, but he doesn't want anything more from me in the romantic department while I'm head over heels for him. (Towards the beginning of our relationship, I actually got clean as to make myself ""better"" for him, and he had no idea. Totally fell off that wagon though once he broke my heart.) ANYWAY, he's the only person who knows that I've ever done dope, though he doesn't know I still do it, he does know I still ""occasionally"" get high but I always just say it's from pills. 

Soooo... that's it. 3 people for me, none of which know my drug of preference (dope) or how often I use (3-4 days a week). However, I must say that I recently met a new friend who's begun middling for me, and it's been a breath of fresh air to have someone I can be totally honest with since he uses dope too. I definitely hope to continue being friends with / become closer to him! Whelp, there's my list! What about ya'll's? :-)",1451922762.0

        ""Fuck.  Fuckin‚Äô sick,"" I thought as I massaged the undersides of my calves to no relief.
	
        I lay back down for a moment to see if I could fall asleep for another half hour.  After a few minutes of kicking and turning I decided to go outside for a walk.  
	
        I got out of bed and put my t-shirt on and zipped my Carhartt vest over top.  I whispered into my girlfriend‚Äôs ear:
	
        ""I can‚Äôt sleep.  I‚Äôm going for a walk.""
	
        She didn‚Äôt respond.  Walking out of our room, I took a tablet of Dexedrine from a bottle on the kitchen table and went outside.  I didn‚Äôt know where I wanted to walk or for how long, so I started walking around the block.  My elbows and forearms were cold where the t-shirt didn‚Äôt cover them.  But my feet were warm in my boots and my hands were warm in my pockets ‚Äì I could bear the cold.  At first my legs felt like gelatin and I wondered if it would be better to lie on the couch.  As I kept walking, though, the task became progressively easier and mindless.  It let my mind drift among no particular thoughts ‚Äì walking meditation.  I remember thinking about how I walked upright and I thought of all of my upright-walking ancestors.  They did a lot more walking than I ever did.  I imagined walking 60 miles to tire a deer for the week‚Äôs meal and thought about how humans are made to walk.
	
        I‚Äôd rounded the block three times and the sky had gone from black to navy.  It was ten past five.  Having been rejuvenated physically and mentally, I decided to go back inside and start my day.  I walked through the kitchen and up the stairs, into my room.  My girlfriend still lay in bed.  She hadn‚Äôt moved since I‚Äôd gotten up.  I took off my vest and my boots and lay down next to her, putting my arm underneath her neck.
	
        ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold,‚Äù she said and inched away.
	
        ‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I said, and put my arm under her pillow and shut my eyes for a few minutes.

And I don't mean the usual ""fuck, he said 20 mins and it's been 4 hours"" usual stuff. It's driving me nuts, I swear this guy is sadistic. 

Of course the guy who is always around is an hour drive away, which isn't ideal on a daily basis. But my other guy fucking delivers right to my door! He's nearby, knows me well enough to front me from time to time & has fire for a fair price. He's the main one I wanna deal with, but he's gotten ridiculous as of late. I don't know what this kid's problem is but I can't imagine he's doing well if this is his main source of income. 

He used to mean 30 mins when he said it. Now I'm 99% sure he is using and everything has changed. It's not just waiting for him when he says he's coming through, the problem is straight up waiting for him to surface, or wake up. 

He'll have stuff, he'll come by. Tomorrow rolls around and he is dry for days. He's waiting to re-up, says he'll be ready at 5 and you don't hear from him until the next day (maybe). He'll disappear for a week to another state, come back with stuff and then at this point it's been a month so his cellphone bill is due. He doesn't pay it, boom, unreachable for another 3 days. Then his phone is back on again; he's dry. Next day he's up, but he'll only have stuff for 24 hours if you're lucky. When you can reach him and his phone is actually on, the kid doesn't wake up until 5PM or 6. REPEAT THE CYCLE. 

It's driving me mad. Most people would say fuck it, but he'll pop up right when I'm ready to give up and say he has a G for me to sample. FOR FREE! He only did this twice btw, it's not like he's handing me free shit left and right. Anyways,I'll get paid and he's around, right before disappearing again. A week goes by and I'm out of money, and that'll be when he resurfaces and fronts me every once in a while. 

Idk, just wondering about other people's horror stories with dealers. Idk how/why he is running out of shit so quickly, especially since with the way he's been acting he must be losing business, I mean come on. He's been making comments about getting sick that make me almost positive he is using in some way. And I've tried to talk to him about the way he is treating my boyfriend and I, ignoring 40 calls over a period of hours and leaving us hanging about when he'll be around, knowing full well that we are sick and waiting on him to just say he's coming through. I'll ask him point blank if he'll be around at a certain time when I'm getting paid, he'll say yes and that's when his phone goes off or he ignores it for days. It's fucked. I wouldn't mind this shit if he would just say, straight up, I'll be dry until tomorrow or the next day, instead of this endless waiting game. 

It fucks with my head, man! Just get your shit together. So, who've your worst dealers been? Stories? Dealer stories, waiting stories? :)

Well today I was able to pawn $300 worth of stuff so I went and scooped up a bunch. I just couldn't bear getting through this work week after two glorious long weekends away from that hell. And I have so much to do at work this week, ugh. 

I mean, I started out my weekend getting sick and took some subs. So in a sense, I did some time getting sick-wise and if I stopped tomorrow I'd still be somewhat protected by this suboxone glow helping to block my receptors. Buuuuut I get paid Thursday, and being high is just so much more preferable to being not high, ya know?! Plus, like I said, I have a lot to do at work and I'm significantly more functional, social and overall enjoyable and useful at work. So really I'm just doing the responsible thing, right?!?! Haha jk, I'm not that delusional. 

But on the real...I can't take the sick/off/back on cycle much longer. It's been going on and off like this every two weeks for as long as I can remember now, and I do eventually need to get my stuff back from the pawn shop (most notably, MY PHONE!). It's just so great when you're up on this stuff 

And to top it all off, I waited upwards to 10 and 1/2 hours for my guy last night. I hit the brink of insanity waiting, no fucking joke. This is getting ridiculous, I need to face reality soon. It's been a full two years now.

I was really loving life again. I came to love being in the presence of other human beings again after a year of total isolation.

And now, one month later, I sit here completely broken. Depressed, hopeless, feeling like a failure, wishing I would have OD'd, and wondering how I did this to myself again.

I had a one week long relapse about 9 days after discharging. Then did a 3 days sub taper and got 6-7 days clean again. Didn't become depressed after that relapse and coming out of it felt totally motivated to continue pursuing my sobriety. I identified that I lacked a sponsor, lacked a therapist, and was really only going to AA meetings without working on the steps at all or reading any recovery literature. 

So I enhanced my program a bit, felt better about things again, but relapsed a week later for another 6 days of daily use. After this relapse, I became extremely depressed mainly because I could just see how it affected my loved ones. And the fact that I had developed physical dependency again and therefore experiencing withdrawals just left me feeling like such a failure. I promised myself I wouldn't use again. But if a relapse were to happen, I realllllllly promised myself that I would never let myself become physically dependent to the point of going to withdrawals upon discontinuation.

So this one really hurts. It hurt so bad that I was feeling so god damn depressed that I picked up yet again. I was laying in between dopesick and feeling guilty that I laying in bed too depressed and sick to help out around the house that I junkie logic'd my way into deciding I would pick up a small amount and use just enough to be able to start being productive for a few days and do a taper off to try to minimize withdrawal.

I'm probably going to need to go back to rehab. I did everything I promised myself I wouldn't do and now I'm back to my depressed, isolationist state of self-loathing. This is what relapse does to you. 

Anyway, I'm sorry if this just looks like a dumb junkie vent post. I just needed to get these feelings out because I was too embarrassed to even share at tonight's AA meeting. Love you all. Hope your day and year so far is going well.",1451870946.0

- Fill the pitcher with the material you want washed leaving about 2-3"" from the top. 
- Add about a tablespoon of [citric acid](http://www.amazon.com/Spicy-World-Citric-Acid-5-Pound/dp/B000OZFECU/ref=sr_1_5? (ie=UTF8&qid=1451780534&sr=8-5&keywords=citric+acid).
- Add enough very hot tap water so that there is about 1/2"" inch of liquid above whatever you're washing
- Shake vigorously for a few minutes and let it sit for about 5 minutes, occasionally shaking and adding water to maintain that 1/2"" of liquid at the top.
- Place the strainer in the top of the canning jar. It should fit perfectly
- Remove the pour spout cap from the pitcher top, and place the pitcher upside down in the strainer. The pitcher top will fit in the strainer, so you can even walk away while it's straining. 

You seeds are now washed!

BONUS:
As a science experiment, you may want to create a citric acid sludge paste from the dirty water!

* Set the temperature of your oven to around no more that 190f, no less than 150f (which would be ideal). 
* Put the liquid into non-stick cookie sheets
* Allow to  ""cook"" until liquid evaporates, and a paste or powder remains.

I have never nor will I, up until my final demise take h, but I would like to acquire it in the right dosage and learn as much as possible about keeping it fresh for as long as possible and how to do it all. I will for example have a secluded cabin far away in nature and hopefully slip into a pain free very deep sleep. 

I believe it's our own right to exit when we want especially if we are in during too much pain, so in 20 ish years if I make it to say 70 and I have some liver desiese or I can't move because of arthritis and I don't want to just vegetate in a nursing home, then I have the option of this idea of a self made euthanasia programme.

Again please don't get the wrong idea I just want information, good or bad about this idea, for example will it spoil or be less effective if I store it for too long? How much would I need?  How do. Test if it's pure enough? How many things can go wrong, if too many then maybe it's just a bad idea. if they are easy to overcome by proper preparation, then why not. I want to live life to the fullest, but I don't want it to end in pain, we care about our animals enough to put them down when in pain why can't we care about ourselves as much?

Feel free to express your opinion good or bad I respect all beliefs on euthanasia and more....In case you haven't understood it so far the idea is to have a stash of h to last long enough and be strong enough to O.D. Peacefully. Quickly etc. I don't like the idea of fire arms as I would like an open casket, and I can make my own preparations to inform local law enforcement, so family will not be affected. 

Yet again, I want to restate I am not depressed and I just want the peace of mind that I have a physical strategy and means by which I can exit peacefully in the future, like a security blanket...

Thanks for any help or information/experience you have with this. I'm not asking how to die, or how to shoot, just the information on simple practical implications and the practicality of testing/storage etc...

I've avoided opiates (except after surgery) due to the rapid tolerance, dependence, etc that go with them. 

I'm sitting here right now, unable to sleep. My mid back pain, my knee pain - sleep just isn't happening. I don't want to become addicted to anything, but I can't keep doing this. I've got nothing against recreational use but that's not what I'm after I just don't want to be in pain. I want to be able to sleep. 

Do any of you have advice on dosing for pain management (not recreational) to minimize dependence? Like only taking before bed since inability to sleep is my main problem? I could probably go every other day and just ""tough it out"" but any more than that doesn't really help me any. How quickly does addiction and dependence happen? How fucked an I long term?

So, I don't need someone to explain the whole process to me. I've got it down, trust and believe.

Now the problem is...I have stomach ulcers. Like really bad ones, where I have to take meds every day for it and if I don't my stomach hurts so much I can't eat.

I've also got myself a good habit going and I'm relying on PST to get by. So I ""have"" to make PST twice a day here. 

Since PST always requires some sort of acid to make (usually like lemon juice or something), the acid I've been taking in every day has been killing my ulcers. I just went down to eat a nice meal after making some tea and now my stomach is fuckin' killing me.

Is there anything at all I can use to extract the goodies when making PST besides an acid? I've heard of people using alcohol like vodka, but that doesn't work for me, because alcohol is also bad on ulcers.

Using just hot water doesn't work. I've tried it, it gets like 1/3 of the alkaloids out.

I take a strong antacid every time I drink the tea to ""balance out"" the effect the acid has. I've even mixed baking soda (a natural base) with the tea to kill all the acid (gross I know, but it kinda works). But it seems like it's not enough. The acid just eats and eats at my tummy.

Argh. Is there anything I can do? Or am I just going to be clutching my stomach all the way to detox?

Today is the day before my birthday, and while I've been sitting in BFE trying to clean up my act I thought a little pre-birthday dope would be a good way to usher in my exit out my mama's nethers and usher out the holidays.  Day started with me coming up on 25 bucks by selling a couple old and broken phones I had lying around to one of those ecoATM machines.  I start hitting mu junkie ass middlemen and dboys up, but they were all still asleep.  Except for my dude K, he hit me back within a half hour and was planning to cop for himself and asked if I wanted to roll with.  I was like hell yeah, K gets good shit and he don't sting on shit like most of my other middle dudes do.  I meet him at a designated spot and motherfucker had already picked up a G and threw me a fat ass shot for my 25.  Don't know if its that my tolerance is lower now that I've been cleaning up, that the dope he gets is just that good, or a combination of both, but this shot got me straight retarded.  I actually nodded a few times, which is kinda a rarity for me unless I've been doing a G of dope over a 24 hour period and not slept.

After a couple hours I pulled my shit together enough to go to the temp agency to register for a program that will (hopefully) place me in a job somewhere that I wouldn't normally be able to work because of my criminal background and actually make decent money instead of this minimum wage bullshit I've been subsiding on for the past nine months.  I got set up for an orientation in two weeks and made my way out to BFE country once again.

Chilled out in the country at my moms where I've been holing myself up at for the past three weeks and talked to her about finally meeting my biological father after 29 years of not knowing the dude.  I've got two sisters and a brother I've never met, and apparently he's finally told them about my existence.  I guess my younger half brother is super excited to meet me.  He didn't grow up with any brothers while I did, so I can understand his excitement that he actually has a big bro out there, and I'd like to be doing well for myself and not be all junked out when I meet him.

About an hour ago I got a call from a strange number.  It was too late to be a bill collector so I answered and it was a call from the county jail.  It turned out to be my homegirl who's been sitting in jail for the past month from a possession and obstruction of justice charge in early 2015 that's finally catching up to her.  She's lucky she didn't get hit with full blown dealing, but she's still gonna have to do about a year in prison.  Now me and this girl have a long and storied relationship.  She was my ride or die bitch for a long time and we've had some flings along the way.  We never actually dated, but there were times we were together every day and I'd be lying if I said I didn't love this bitch.  I may or may not be the father of her child, but she fucked so many other dudes in the timeframe she got pregnant its hard to tell.  She DNA tested like 5 dudes and the kid isn't any of their's, so its basically down to me and one other dude now.  I was gonna pay for a DNA test myself, but me and her had a dalling out when I found out she was getting engaged to the fuckhead that got her busted and hiding it from me and doing a bunch of stupid shit out on bond for some pretty heavy charges.  But she actually made the attempt to call me, and I got to talk to her in her sober state, which isn't something I've been able to do very often in the time I've known her but is always a delight.  She said she'd been thinking a lot about me, and I told her I had thought about writing her recently because I know what it's like to be locked up over the holidays and shit.  And while I didn't say it cuz of my pride, I miss her a lot and have been thinking about her and following her court stuff since she got locked up.  

We're both pretty well practiced in using a 15 minute jail call efficiently and talked about all kinds of things in that time but nothing too deeply.  When the robot bitch came on the line and said we had one minute remaining we wrapped things up by us setting up a time for her to call me tomorrow on my actual birthday and said our goodbyes.  She told me how much she loved and missed me, which I'll be honest melted my heart a little.  I wish I had said the same to her, but again my pride stopped me from doing so and that may be for the best.  I think this time around I might be better served not giving into a false sense of love and be the one trying to actually build a real relationship with her, but let her be the one that wants to do so with me if that's what she truly wants.  I mean I'm not gonna wait on a bitch for a year while shes in prisom, but I might be waiting for her when she walks out into the world again.  Idk, but if there's any bitch I'd be waiting on the outside for with arms wide open it would be her.  She's fucking beautiful and we connect on a truly deep lebel.  It's just that the bullshit we put ourselves through has always gotten in the way of having a real relationship.  But if dope is out of both our lives who knows.

It's been such an awesome day. For the first time in a long time I'm actually feeling true, deep feelings, and they're good ones.  Between the possibility of a good paying job, meeting my paternal bloodline, and talking to a woman I honestly truly love after breaking communication with her for six months, I think I may have found true motivation to clean up my shit for real.  I've been going through the motions of getting clean for the past three weeks but my heart's not been there.  But I think I've finally found it, I can feel it beating and I can feel the soul inside me that's been put to bed under a blanket of opiates start to stir from it's slumber.  I'm going into 29 actually hopeful about the future.  It feels good man.  It feels really good.

Most of you wont follow these posts, and even more of you probably don't give a shit, but I am doing this for myself. I am not doing this for you.

For those of you that do stick with me for the next 14 days...I promise I will do the right thing and show all of you my junk at the end of the 14 days..maybe by then I'll be able to at least get a half chub goin!

I am not quite sure how to write this, and this is also most likely going to be my happiest, most optimistic post on this..considering I am faded right now.

Alright, so for those of you that stuck around;

*Who:*
	I am in my mid 20's. I have a degree from a decent university in Structural Engineering, despite being hooked on dope for 3 out of the 5 years I spent in college. I have a very loving and supporting family, and we never fight/argue. They put me through college so luckily I have zero debt! I have started my career as a project engineer for one of the largest construction companies in the world, and I have an amazing girlfriend who I plan to marry in the next year. I am good looking (not trying to be conceded. I am by no means ""hot"", but I am attractive in my own ways. In other words, you would never suspect I'm a junkie.

*What:*
	I have literally done just about every drug out there. From shrooms/acid to meth. I started smoking weed at 13, and have smoked just about every day since. I tried Coke for the first time when I was 16, and have never really been a fan. I only do it when my friends offer while we are out partying. My brother introduced me to oxy when I was 18, and god damn I loved that shit. I got hooked pretty fast, and within 3 years I was almost failing out of school. I took a semester off to do an internship in a city I have never been, and quickly found an oxy dealer. it wasn't long before I was fired from my internship, and I confessed to my parents and moved back home with them. I transferred to a school near by, and of course an old buddy from my hometown sold oxy. It was a few months before he told me ""hey dude I don't sell pills anymore, but I got boy. It's hella cheaper for a better high"" I remember saying ""nah, I'm good"" while driving through my neighborhood after turning around because I could no longer pick up pills. I remember the moment I parked on the side of the street and said ""you know what? Fuck. I'm sick and I'm going to try heroin"".

You all know how it goes from here. I never went to class other than test day, but luckily I am good at last minute cramming, and I made A's on every test I took, but had 0's on most all quizzes and homework. I graduated with a shit GPA by the skin of my teeth. I didn't know I was going to graduate literally until 3 days before the ceremony when my teacher called me and told me he bumped my grade up from a 32% to a 89% (because I wrote him an excel program that he can use with the students every semester to save time on building tables, graphs, and analyzing data...so I graduated, failed a drug test for my first job offer, and passed it for my second, better, job offer. (I interview well). A few months into working a getting paid very well, I relapsed again bad. I am in the middle of that now doing a gram a day/every other day of ECP.

*Where:*
	U.S.A - Southeast....that's all I'm tellin ya

*When:*
	Day 1 is tomorrow, 1/5/16. Day 14 (my final day of the documentation a.k.a Dick Pic Day) will be 1/19/16.

*Why:*
	First and foremost, heroin/drugs are going to ruin my life, and I am planning on living a kickass healthy life with my future wife and children..which leads me to reason number 2: I absolutely LOVE my girlfriend, and for some reason..she LOVES me too. God damn it is an amazing feeling to be loved by somebody this fucking amazing. I can't go into too much detail, but she is also an engineer. Valedictorian of our graduating class, straight A student, smartest girl I have ever met, DROP-DEAD GORGEOUS, funny, extremely loyal, loving, kind-hearted, beautiful. If she found out I was still using drugs she would most likely leave me, and even if she didn't I would die knowing that I am putting her through that pain.

*How:*
	Right now I still have about 0.5g of good ECP. I ""plan"" on spreading that out over the first week, then using lope for the second week....but to be honest I think I am about to go to a little bump right now. I only snort, and have never used a needle..so I guess I got that goin for me. I have about 4 Xanax bars as well to help me sleep. Maybe I'll just pop a quarter of one now instead of doing a bump so I will pass out. But from then on it is going to be cold turkey. No drugs, no weed, no cigarettes.



To everyone who read all of this, thank you. In about 4-5 days when I run out of H and the actual withdrawals kick I will be singing to a different tune lol.

I am not sure how to continue this for the next 14 days..should I do an update (Day 1: ~~~) (Day 2: ~~~) in the comments section here? Or should I make a new post every day? I might need a little help from you pros out there. I am on mobile and really don't know how to go about doing this.

I really think this journal/diary(gay)/documentation is going to help me stay on track, and hold myself accountable. Any encouragement from you guys would really make me happy.

My daily posts will NOT be this long, I swear lol. This is just an introductory post to let you guys know who I am, tell you about my habit, and explain what the purpose of this is.

Wellllp. I'll talk to you niggas tomorrow for Day 1!!

I promise to reply to each and every comment you guys leave me here. I look forward to taking this final step, and documenting the whole thing for myself, and hopefully for some other struggling addicts.

Cheers everyone!

Goodnight,
H

""we're out"".  

I think it was like 70/30 them actually being out, and them not wanting to fill an oxy (10 mg, for the record) script for someone younger like me who isn't visibly in pain. I've encountered that a lot. 


The interesting thing is, I had about 10 pharmacists tell me the reason they don't have any is because of the holidays and the weekend, so many people filled their scripts they're cleaned out. I had another 10 tell me the reason they don't have it is because it's an uncommon script in their area, so they don't typically keep many in stock at all save for their few regulars. Two completely contrasting things, by multiple pharmacists, all in the same region for all intents and purposes.

More to the point, I've noticed on here and other sites people are claiming it helps a fuckton with withdrawals. Someone even said they were taking small(ish) doses (like 20mg oral) once a day and it killed their WD's in three days. So, questions:

1) Is this too good to be true? If not...

2) Has this worked for you? How much did you take and how often? Did you snort it, or eat it?

3) How many days did it take for you to get off your DOC?

4) Did you have any lingering effects or WD's from the MXE, as opposed to the opiate?

5) Did it only help with physical WD's, or mental ones as well?

Anything else to add?

These people say that the MXE made them feel a little wonky (I mean it's a dissoc, so duh...) but not to the extent that it was disabling. So no one was going into M-holes or anything.

I've sorta kinda tried this with **DXM** before. I would take 60 mg a day when WD'ing and it definitely took the edge off but just wasn't enough. I never tried taking a recreational dose of DXM which is maybe why it didn't work. Due to how weird DXM is though I wasn't comfortable tripping on it, even on a low level, several days in a row.

EDIT: I guess if you've had similar success using **ketamine** or **other NMDA antagonists** to kick then you can add that, since they're all similar to MXE.",1451952952.0

60mgs of morphine had me falling back onto the bed because the rush was so intense. but the dilaudid was just kind of ""nice"". it was warm and euphoric, like I expected it to be, but not the intense, overwhelming, face-melting experience it was hyped up as.

I just wanted to share a short bit about my weekend. On Thursday one of my best friends was supposed to drive to my city to spend New Year's Eve with me. Thursday afternoon rolls around and he hasn't replied to any of my texts so I figure he was just busy or getting ready. I text him to let me know when he gets close to town and the night goes on as per usual. 

I just found out last night that he fatally overdosed at the young age of 23. This really can happen to anyone, and I never thought it would happen to him; a college educated, very successful, smart, well off, and well put together kid. 

I know he visited this sub fairly regularly so I figured he would want me to let you guys know. Guys, please be honest with your friends and family about how often/much you use. I promise we'd rather have you admit to it and be upset than to find you dead on New Year's Day. Most people meeting my friend never would have even assumed that he did any drugs. I knew he used but he had always told me how he kept himself in check and I trusted him.

Please please please be honest and don't be ashamed if you are an addict. It is a disease that can affect anyone. Reach out, get help if it's getting serious. I would hate for any of you to have to deal with what his family and friends are going through.

I've had an abcess tooth before and this feels almost exactly like that.  I'm probably gonna go to the hospital for this here in a couple hours.  Last time I went and had an abcess tooth they sent me home with a script of norcos and antibiotics.

I could easily not get the script filled if they give me one at the hospital or just call the clinic and see if they'll authorize it, but I'm hoping they'll shoot me up with some morphine or administer some pills when I'm there.  I'm just wondering if it's a waste of time even going to the hospital in the first place.  If this is actually an abcess I probably need to go and get antibiotics regardless of whether they give me any opiates.

I was just here yesterday, and then two days before that, and a day before that, and...

&nbsp;


**11:46PM.** It‚Äôs been almost 24 hours since I‚Äôve felt that warm blanket of complacency wrap around my mind as if to say, ‚ÄúYou need this to feel like yourself again.‚Äù Is life so jagged that you had to come back here, to this place, again, in the hopes of grinding some of the edges off your monotonous existence? You say that you don‚Äôt need them, these little blue thirty dollar tickets to a better understanding of who you are as a person, to help unlock your ‚Äòpotential.‚Äô You say that this will be the last time for a week, that you have other things to spend your money on, you have bills to pay and, quite frankly, it‚Äôs becoming harder and harder to stay wrapped in that blanket. Each time you come here, it takes just a little more to feel the way you want to feel, one more toe that can‚Äôt quite get warm under the covers. 

&nbsp;


**11:47PM.** Every passing minute feels like a missed opportunity to leave and break the cycle. *‚ÄúHow did we get here?‚Äù* the narrator to my life would be saying if this was a movie and the audience was looking for deeper contextual awareness. Freezing my ass off in a borrowed car from a friend who thinks I moonlight as a bartender to keep up with student loan payments; the audience would learn about my first experience with my blanket, when all it took was a few Vicodin to keep my mind from racing and the pain in my‚Ä¶ *‚ÄúNo,‚Äù* the narrator would stop. There wasn‚Äôt any pain. Our lead character is using that as a crutch to mask his addiction; there isn‚Äôt anything physically wrong with him. Or at least there wasn‚Äôt, until he started parking his borrowed car in this fucking parking lot every other day. 

&nbsp;


**11:48PM.** What‚Äôs taking him so long this time? He never takes this long; something must have happened. Did I text the wrong number? Did I give him enough motivation to pick up for me? Is he holding this over my head, laughing from the apartments I can see through my fogged up windshield, waiting for me to text again and again, questioning how long until he gets here? *‚ÄúHe always comes through,‚Äù* says the narrator to the audience, *‚Äú‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs where the problem began in the first place.‚Äù* Yeah he comes through, like a conquering Viking pillaging the soft belly of my soul with blue poison-tipped daggers. But I need him. I need the pain to subside and I need my blanket.

&nbsp;


**11:49PM.** I can almost imagine how my life is going to change in the next 20 minutes. He‚Äôs going to jump in this car, I‚Äôll get everything I need, and then I‚Äôm done with this parking lot. On wet pavement, white lines and cars start to blur together and remind me of how close I am to my goals and dreams. It‚Äôs like the painted boundaries of this parking lot are some sort of metaphor for my boxed in potential, clouded by the haze of desire that continues to fog up this borrowed car, in this parking lot that I won‚Äôt be coming back to anytime soon. All he needs to do is open the car door, and I‚Äôll be on my way. 


&nbsp;


**11:55PM.** Driving with one hand on the steering wheel, the other crushing and chopping, crushing and chopping until I can finally rail myself back into my blanket. Just make it home. Concentrate. 


&nbsp;


*‚ÄúSitting on his couch, he closes his eyes, with a half smile that only he knows the reason behind. His girlfriend talks about the new shoes she‚Äôs thinking of picking up tomorrow,‚Äù* the narrator says softly, not wanting to wake me. In my dreams, the sky is blue, but all I see are the white lines of a parking lot.

I finally got off Subs. Subs are great! But they are still an opiate substitute and I don't want to be on them forever. Anyway To get off the subs (4mg/6Months) I did 5 DAYS of dillaudid so I withdrew from a short acting Opiate.  Withdrawals are not bad. Clonodine and Klonopin are a must have! Clonidine helps RLS and lowers your blood pressure so you are not anxious. It is a DETOX must have.
 Its day 8 and I am seeing the light. Zero depression. 
 
Im getting on the vivitrol injection next week. Doc gave me oral Naltrexone, 50mg a day to take till then.

Its 2016, the year I am going to be clean and serene. 

So my question is for the people on vivitrol. Have you stuck with the 28 day appointments to get the shot? How are cravings?  Is drinking on vivitrol pointless? Any unusual side effects? How many months did you continue to take the shot for?

Thanks in advance for the responses.

Anyway, after those 2 weeks, I felt normal as ever, and I didn't touch any opaites for about 2+ months. But interestingly enough, every time I used opiates from that point my tolerance seems to have skyrocketed even though I should have been opiate free for a pretty extended period of time, sometimes months at a time, but at the least a few weeks. 

Even now after snorting some raw(H). I'm experienced enough with opiates before that extended period of suboxone to know this isn't some psychological tolerance, or in this particular case the quality of the H. I've read about other people experiencing the same thing and was interested if anyone else on this board had the same thing happen to them. 

For reference, I've never had any problems with opiates or an addiction to them. I just enjoy binging on them, with the binges happening rarer and rarer it seems. ",1452064899.0

I really want to get high was winning out.  been using every day for a little over 2 weeks but not large amounts.  was feeling shitty but not ""OMG I'm so fucking sick"" shitty

as luck would have it I was dead broke.  tried to hustle up some shit to get something.  had something worked out to give a dope boy a ride in exchange for dope.  went to pick him up but he stopped answering his phone....  had another trade deal worked out in which dude also stopped answering my calls but did text back ""don't u have to see ur PO in a cpl days?""  guess in a way he was lookin out.

so I stopped by a good friends place who I know will throw me a sub for free if I ask her to cuz she doesn't want me doing dope.  anyway like I said I was feeling shitty, DEFINITELY in withdrawl period.  hadn't used in at least 18+ hours.  did not feel was anywhere near in danger of precip withdraw.

I'm a junkie so I decided I was going to bang half the sub,  which I have done in the past both subutex and suboxone and never had an adverse effect (I know banging pills and subs even strips is bad for u but whatev).  I was in friends bathroom lookin for q-tip/cotton and couldn't find shit.  I got the bright idea to use a little tiny piece of toilet paper as my filter.  it didn't really work, couldn't draw shit thru the TP and noticed it was kinda dissolving....  I eventually just draw it up no filter hit a vein and go.  

I get that feeling of mental relief u get after the shot goes in like ""ok I'ma feel better in a few seconds here""  and then I get this feeling like a rush like ""something"" is coming and I get excited.

that's when shit hit the fan.  my whole body felt like it was on fire.....it felt like someone poured hot acid in my stomach.  every muscle in my body ached, my pupils dilated to like 5x their size so fast I could ""feel"" it happening (it was only the feeling that made me look in the mirror to see how big they were) 

my skin went pale, felt like I was going to puke and shit at the same time and then pass out.  basically I felt like I was more dope sick than I ever been in my life.  I mean I guess precip withdraw happened but I don't see how, I thought for sure enough time had passed between dope use.

was it the toilet paper?  IDK.  but I felt pretty bad for like 90 min and then it started to subside.  after a few more hours all that feeling subsided and I didn't even really feel dope sick anymore I felt like the sub was working.  IDK it was really weird and scary, definitely thought for a second I had really fucked something up and was going to have to go to the ER.",1452050884.0

The other way I have found is to take a little in the morning and then go to work and leave it at home so I can't take it even if I wanted to. Then I can take more when I am done with work. I have a hard time with this though some mornings. I need a safe with a timer on it.

After leaving my hospital about six weeks ago for an appendectomy procedure, I was given a prescription for the antibiotics required for healing along with the aforementioned painkillers. I only purchased the painkillers just in case the pain for post-surgery ever became unbearable. It never really did and I feel fully recovered. Lately, having absolutely nothing else to do with the pills, I've been taking them recreationally. I take them right before I go to sleep, and have been enjoying the high that comes with it (Watching episodes of 30 Rock along with taking Percocet has been a wonderful combination so far). 

Fearing the threat of addiction, I will only take a pill once every three days or so, hopefully getting to enjoy the high that comes with taking the drug and minimizing the chances of having my body get used to the drug. I will obviously only take one pill at a time, and swallow the pill as opposed to snorting it. Is this actually a sound plan, or do I just have my head shoved up my ass? I am not all that experienced with taking drugs recreationally, and I am fucking terrified of becoming addicted to the drug. Thus far, I am shown absolutely no signs of addiction. I have about 37 or so pills left in the bottle. Am I better off just flushing the pills down the toilet, or can I continue taking a pill once or twice a week, eventually finishing off the bottle and end up being completely NOT addicted to the drug?

I hit the snooze button a handful of times, have a pissed off significant other poke me after the third or fourth alarm reset since I just destroyed her dream of becoming the next Julia Child, and eventually roll out of bed ‚Äì my feet greet the cold hardwood with chagrin. 


&nbsp;


My current morning ritual has become clockwork; if clocks could be hopelessly addicted to painkillers and require 60mg of oxy and 5HTP in horse-sized doses to work properly. After taking a hot shower and putting on a black pinstriped suit, I make the only decision that ever-so-slightly adds a level of individualism to my attire: the all-important tie. 


&nbsp;


As I stare at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, it dawns on me that I went from being sixteen and bitching about having to wearing one of ten different polos to work to having the freedom to wear whatever I wanted to my nine to five. With the fashion world at my disposal, and after swearing I‚Äôd never go back to that polo-wearing culture of drones, I now have evolved, grown up, and proudly wear one of six suits in a predictable rotation. 


&nbsp;


I look at the twenty-something year old face staring back at me. Most people take things at face value. If your entire life you are told that the sky is blue, then it stands to reason that when someone asks you, *‚Äúwhat color is the sky,‚Äù* you will, without hesitation, answer, *‚Äúblue.‚Äù* You might even know that the sky is actually blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light, but to the average person, all that really matters is that the sky in all its vastness, is, at face value, blue. 


&nbsp;


When someone tells you, *‚Äúthe stove is hot, don‚Äôt touch it,‚Äù* it might even take a little first-hand experience of you touching a burner for you to believe that the stove is hot, however in the end, you come to the conclusion that the stove, when on, is truly hot. We tell children that cartoon shows only last for thirty minutes, it takes two minutes to cook a Hot-Pocket so that the cheese is perfectly melted on the inside and the edges are just the right temperature, et cetera.


&nbsp;


**But what of my face value?** What do people see me as and automatically assume due to preconceived notions? My shirt is name brand, pressed and tailored in all the right places, but it covers up the marks that run up my arms; my true character. I‚Äôve got an antique watch that could scream old family heirloom, yet I only wear it to hide the scars from a bad night of withdrawals and poor decisions with an x-acto knife. I see a man with a well maintained haircut and blue eyes, but just like the color of the sky, that‚Äôs only face value. The only honest part of my reflection is the abyssal black pin drops staring back at me.


&nbsp; 


As I leave for work and turn up the collar on my jacket to avoid eye contact with the homeless who live outside my building, I fantasize about dropping little macadamia nuts in dime bags just to watch the chaos unfold. Sooner or later, one morning they‚Äôd recognize me as the guy that gave them Whole Foods products instead of rocks, and after sizing me up at face value, they‚Äôd beat the ever living shit out of me.

Never had dope like this, looks like your typical dark brown powder that sticks together and gets hard when its in your pocket, but the taste of the smoke... fuck. I put a piece of it against my tongue, and my god was it bitter. No taste, just PURE bitterness. Usually dope is bitter, but it has that...dope flavor. Not this stuff. The only thing I can think of is quinine...as I heard that stuff is bitter as fuck and is a usuall cut to all heroin, especially your dark brown powders.



So /r/opiates, what the fuck can I do to tolerate this stuff? I've been smoking forever and this is by far the worst tasting dope I have ever had - its not even a dope taste if you ask me. I love the dope taste... I miss it...I want to taste it again. But ya, what the fuck can I do with this stuff? I have about 10g left... can't sell it...please help a brother out lol.",1452145845.0

So I'm seeing my Dr tomorrow finally after waiting for my insurance to kick in for the new year. So I was previously prescribed an anti depressant like Lexapro or somethingx along with Klonopin .5 Mg's & Propranolol (all for my depression/anxiety). Anyways, the last time I got my scripts filled was 2 years ago, I had gotten a DUI for heroin & klonopin & was abusing my kpins. So I stopped taking all of that, ended up going to jail/rehab/halfway house for a total of 7 months (Sept 15, 2014- March 27, 2015) and while I was in rehab I refused to take any psych meds because I had plans on going into the military (can't take any psych meds a year prior to joining) anyways, life was good until I've had a very very tough year, I relapsed but over pretty much pulled myself together & have kept myself as much together as possible, but I've lost a few friends this past year & lost my ex boyfriend but he & I were working on getting back together & we were very close, I was with him for almost 4 years. He passed away November 23rd, & since then I've been a total wreck, can't sleep, barely able to eat or work, I've thankfully kept my job but some days I just cry from the time I get up til the time I eventually pass out from benadryl or  Advil PM. I'm seriously depressed & don't enjoy life at all anymore, along with heavy feelings of disassociation & crazy panic attacks at least once a day when I have to go out in public. Anyways, I don't really wanna tell my Dr that I went to rehab or struggle with addiction because I don't wanna be treated differently. I mean, I know I can tell her that I wanted off the psych meds because I was planning on enlisting, but I've changed my mind because I really enjoy & have the opportunity to move up in my current profession. I just don't want her to be suspicious since it's been a while since I saw her last, I would've gone sooner but I was waiting for my insurance to kick in. I don't remember exactly the anti depressant I was on though, idk, should I just explain to her what's going on, leaving out the addiction part & focus on my symptoms/being treated for that? I do plan on asking for a referral to a therapist because I know I definitely need it right now. Can anyone give me tips on what to say to her? She's always been really cool, I switched to her & told her what I had been taking from a previous Dr without even having my med records transferred over by my previous dr . any tips/ suggestions appreciated, I hate feeling like I have to hide my addiction from my doc but I want to be treated right.

I posted this on the drugs subreddit, but I know you are just as partial to the needle and the IV process as me so here it is again. Don't use reddit much, so I don't know much bout the repost feature, maybe the mods are fine with this anywho. I'm not looking to whore Karma, I could give a fuck!

I've been shooting Coke religiously for the past month or so. I never liked it snorted, didn't feel that superior to booze for me. Being a dopefiend, I have an inclination to shoot everything that will even remotely dissolve in water. If you ever shot Coke, you know how fucking good it is. No other drug will provide the same rush, not even the best H. Also, there are no physical withdrawals so why not run wild right?

Problem is the high fades much faster than H so you'll be redosing more often. This comes with all kind of problems. Most likely you'll be using the same needle over and over again, because, hey, just one more before you go to the exchange right? I've shut down a vein or two doing this and thank God the only health issue I encountered was that I'd have to find a new vein to bang. It could be much worse.

Also, watch your heartbeat after you've shot up a good amount. Scary right? Here's the reason I write this. I overdid it on Tuesday and I though I was dying for sure. Not the ""I'm rushing so hard I might die LMAO"" kind but the actual I overdid it and my heart will burst within the next minutes kind. I was too nervous and jittery to ask for assistance and that was stupid for me. I did test shots, but they don't help when your next impulse is ""HMM THIS GOOD COKE. ME WANT MORE!""

Anyway, I didn't measure my pulse because fuck, that woulda freaked me out even more and I don't wanna be a part of the vicious cycle that ends up cilling ya. I ended up shooting dope (safer use right?) and I calmed down after a few minutes. My heart rate went down, I nodded a bit and thanks to the H, I didn't get the comedown or paranoia thankfully.

That being said, I got lucky. I had dope around and it didn't fuck my body any further, but this coulda ended bad, i.e. I'm dead and my parents come to visit and find me with a point in my arm dead.

A few minutes go by but he thinks nothing of it. The d-boys like to chat sometimes and it takes a while for them to count out the buns and baggies and what not.
After about 10 minutes my boy starts to worry. He thinks his girl might be in trouble. Maybe they're giving her a hard time or something and maybe she is in danger.
SO my boy runs out the car into the building and up to d boys apartment door. knocks but hears nothing. At this point he's mad worried so he just turns the knob and lo and behold the door opens.

What happens next is unspeakable. His girl is bent over the kitchen table taking it in the ass from the d boy while his friend is mouth fucking her. The craziest part is NO ONE NOTICES HE IS IN THERE. The dude mouth fuckin her even pulls out for a second and walks away. 
He thought maybe for a sec his girl was getting raped until he hears her moan ""oh fuck yea"". Finally she notices and pushes the dude away and goes ""baby it's not what you think, I was getting us a free brick"". 

WHHHAAAATTT HAHAHAHAH. HOW crazy is that shit.
Needless to say my boy turns around and just leaves the bitch in there. He's so pissed, and I feel bad for him but HAHAH thats fuckin crazy.

That there is hope that one more hit,
Will satisfy this bottomless pit,
Maybe this time the warmth will stay,
And will always take my breath away, 
And this rush once so fleeting, 
Now as present as a heart beating, 
But this will never be the truth,
Trust me; I'm living proof, 
For a pleasure so sweet must pass,
Never will this feeling last, 
And once sobriety clears your mind,
More poison you must find, 
Because when thoughts are clear,
Responsibilities suddenly appear,
No longer can you hide, 
Behind dia-morphine hydrochloride, 
But maybe there is a chance, 
Real life beats this dance,
And the damage can be repaired,
It's not too late, I can be spared.

About half way through my libido is completely shot. I didnt beat off. I didnt even think about beating off. Its like the first 5 or 10 minutes after you orgasm and youre completely free of sexual urges, (most guys will know what im talking about) thats my life now. 

Im currently on subs. I was hoping my libido situation would improve but it has not. It pretty much hasnt changed at all. I really like my current sub doc. Literally everything i could possibly hope for. I mentioned tapering my dose down. He was very against it because he feels its best that people are on a stable dose for at least a year (for patients that want maintenance and not a detox regimen) before messing with their dose. He explained that this way life stabilizes and you relearn alot of life skills without dope before messing with your dose and possibly tempting you. Cant say i disagree with him. But i didnt want to taper for cost or to make jumping off easier in the long run. I just want to be a normal dude with at least somewhat active libido again. 

I also told him about this and the fact im still very lethargic. This conversation happened about a month and a half maybe 2 months into this round of sub maintenance. He told me to wait a few months and we would discuss it again. Well its been a few months. 6 actually. I plan to bring this up in my appointment next week.

Last month I learned about opiate induced androgen deficiency in my research. Im not sure if this is the exact reason we lose our sex drive but im willing to bet good money it is, and quite possibly what i could be suffering from.

Do any other longterm addicts have any experience with this? Whether on maintenance or not? What helped? Did you seek medical help? If so what did they do for you and what was the process like?

It was rumored to be the sun, warm and blissful. I stared until the gold faded to silver, and then I went to sleep. A fitful, anxious sleep. 

The rest of that spring, I climbed the trees, my small paws inadequate to the mammoth task. Each day I fell, tumbled down the vines and ferns to the jungle floor. Each day I was reminded of the mocking truth: my lot was to crawl the forest floor, never to feel the warmth of sunlight upon my flesh. Yet each day I climbed. 

The days grew long, and my progress up the wooded spires improved. The echoing, mocking truth that the trees were likely growing taller faster than my climbing skills were progressing, doomed me to my small, crawling life. Yet each day I lied to my self, perhaps, just above the next bit of foliage obstructing my glory, lay the rumored bronze touch of the sun. 

Then, at once, my lie became truth. I had mounted the colossal, ancient walls of my jungle prison, and squinted in the light of a distant fire for the very first time. My ears rang with the calls of ascending birds for the first time. And I was afraid for the first time. Paws bloodied, the branches on which I perched (now themselves the inadequate ones, and I the mammoth) bent and swayed under my intruding weight. 

Hungry from my efforts, I searched for food and found none. Absent were the beetles and the worms which I daily loathed. All around, the lush greenery was as a barren desert, empty with promises. 

Thirsty from my exertion, I sniffed for water and found none. No pools or dew survived the harsh light. The long anticipated warmth robbed the canopy of all free moisture. 

Suddenly fearful for my life, I forgot my quest for greatness. I plunged below the canopy into the enveloping damp and dark. I plummeted and collided down the limbs of my foe until I lay in a familiar heap upon the slimy moss bottom. A soft thud was emitted and lost in the din of bustling jungle life. 

Once more in my crowded habitat, I searched for food. Prodigal were beetles and worms, perfectly supplied for my taking. The close forest floor was a loving home, full with my needances. 

There, too, was the dew and pools. The cool water, thick with algae and conspicuous flotsam, quenched my thirst like never before. My chaining moat had become a desert oasis. 

That night I slept long and peacefully. My dreams were of simple, daily tasks of wandering a forest floor, cast in new illumination. And when I awoke, I experienced a contentness known only to children in mothers arms. I could survive. I could survive from the beetles and the worms. I could survive by knowing that my life was perfectly crafted in purpose and ability. I had climbed the tree. I had felt the light, and the light burned. My subsequent plummet to the floor had landed me in paradise.",1452231693.0

**My Honest College Entrance Essay**

&nbsp;


Being a teenager in 2015 is more difficult than my parents could ever understand. The pressures to always keep your Instagram and Facebook accounts up to date, who is wearing what and which celebrities are dating ‚Äì its sometimes just overwhelming. These are not things my parents had to deal with. 

&nbsp;


Another thing my parents never did was go to college, and that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôm writing this essay to your university today. If you accept me, I‚Äôd be the first person in my family to ever go on to higher education. As the older sister to three brothers, I not only want to set a good example for them, but I need this to better myself and break free of the cycle of people who stay in my home town. No one here accomplishes much, and everyone is addicted to some sort of drug. And since this essay is my only shot at a better life, I‚Äôll be honest with you, unnamed person who I will never meet: I used to be of them.

&nbsp;

 
I started getting into painkillers three years ago, right after I passed my driver‚Äôs license test. My friend Marissa stole a bottle of hydrocodone from her parent‚Äôs medicine cabinet and to celebrate we ate a couple. The feeling of euphoria was like nothing I had ever experienced. I ended up sitting in my house, surrounded by the screams of my father yelling at my mother, plates being thrown against the wall, my baby brother crying, but all of that just faded into the background. It was like I found my center, and from that point on I never wanted to let that feeling go. 

&nbsp;


Marissa sort of stopped after we ran through her bottle, but I couldn‚Äôt go back to feeling‚Ä¶ normal. So I ended up dating this guy named James, who I knew wasn‚Äôt the right person for me to be with, but he opened doors to the one thing I did want to be with: that feeling. He was the first person to introduce me to oxycontin, which if you didn‚Äôt know is this really really powerful pill that you pretty much only get if you have a serious medical condition. The first time I did that, I was hooked. Day after day, James and I used to sit around and smoke them on pieces of tin foil. The beatings my father used to give me if I came home late became almost bearable, knowing it wasn‚Äôt my mind he was hurting. That was floating far above the tragic scene taking place below. 

&nbsp;


James graduated and got an apartment close to my High School, and I sometimes went on drives with him to see his other friends and pick up a backpack. I‚Äôm not stupid, I knew what I was getting into, but between how he treated me and how he made me feel, I didn‚Äôt care. The afternoon I skipped 6th period and came over to his place and saw him shooting up Heroin, I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. How could he do this to himself? To us??! I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone else, and I didn‚Äôt know what to do so I just sat there on the floor in his bathroom for hours, listening to him talk through the door and try to tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs all right‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs all good‚Äù but it wasn‚Äôt. 

&nbsp;


In my D.A.R.E. class they warned us about ‚ÄúJunkie Logic,‚Äù where someone justifies doing something just to get high. But how could they warn you about the only person you care about in the world falling victim to that disgusting state of mind? You can‚Äôt go back from that, and I couldn‚Äôt go back to him. If he said he couldn‚Äôt control his actions or take charge of his life, fine, but he would have to do it without me. 
From that day on, I haven‚Äôt touched a single pill or returned one of his phone calls. As much as I miss that getaway place where my mind could go, I miss him more, but that chapter in my life has closed now. I worked hard in my classes, studied for the SAT, and want to go to your school because I see it as a way for me to never look back on this town and to better myself. I want to learn to love again, and grow as a person without these rainclouds hovering above me. 

&nbsp;


Isn‚Äôt that what college is all about?

I usually only take on an empty stomach,"Of late I've been doing oxy as opposed to dope. I don't see much point in sniffing oxy - eating pills is my preference. I eat like 60mg on waking when my stomach is empty, then cook up a breakfast.

If I'm redosing orally I wait a at least 4 hours then take another pill before having a late lunch. I don't snack in between meals to maximize the effects. 

I ate meal about 4 hours ago, but just binged on a load of candy so my tummy doesn't exactly feel empty.

In times such as this I tend to resort to snorting - seeing popping oxy on anything but an empty stomach as a waste - but at the moment want to give my nose a break.

But I want to redose soon and am tempted to gobble more. Like I say, the only reason I snort is because I've got food in my belly but I wonder if I'm sticking to the empty stomach rule a bit too strictly.

Will the candy ive consumed actually ruin the effects that much? Will it just take longer to kick in?

This is going to be tough because I have been taking about 8 a day. Luckily I only just started taking them on Monday. So it's not like I have been on them for months. Just a few days.

Still I was taking them to help with my tramadol wiithdrawals. I can and have handled a lot of pain and sickness in my life. But the one thing I CANNOT  handle is opiate withdrawal.

I'm gonna try to take 4 pills today and 4 tomorrow. 

But what I need to find out is how can I make the high better when taking it by mouth?

Im thinking it depends on what beverage you wash it down with?

I always take my shit with milk. It's a habit. For some reason it just seems safer. And I dont get as much nausea. But it takes about 45 minutes to feel anything. And the high is very very short.

Should I take one with water? Would that make the high last longer? Or soda? Or maybe crush the pill up a bit?

I want to get the maximum affect from the few pills  I have left. I like taking them by mouth so I don't want to snort or Iv.

We decided on New Year's Eve to go HAM and do all five of our grams that we had planned to make last for several days. We thought we could get real high with it and ring in the new year nodding. Well New Year's Day came and she's hurting for a squirting (in her arm). I manage to scrounge up all of 35$ and make the one hour drive for the tiniest little bit of this shit that is 90% baking soda. But it kept us from getting sick that night so we were happy. 

Well on to the point of my story. I had hit up my main dude asking to float a g on 1/1 but he was out of town. He said he would just give it to me for free the next day. Well we wake up feeling like death on 1/2 like stuff coming out both ends you know how it goes. Well we get the word to make the one hour drive so she heads out while I strap myself into the bed for the long haul. 

Apparently when she was only about 10 minutes from the meeting place which is an hour from our house, she trusted the wrong fart. And it wasn't just a little bit, it was like everything from the past two weeks. She calls me bawling her eyes out and I feel bad for what I said but when you're sick you are sometimes a different person. She wanted me to bring her clothes but with our situation (sadly, we have a child who is 4 months old and I didn't have a car seat) I couldn't easily do that. But I tell her she has already driven an hour so she might as well just meet up with the dude. So she sits in her shit for 30 minutes waiting for dboy then drives the hour back. I know she hated me that day, but I had the shower hot and ready for her when she pulled up. Plus the spoons and needles were ready to go too. So everyone was happy. But that was definitely the smallest gram I have ever seen. We went through it in 20 minutes. Washed a check for more money, and got another 4 gs that night. But when I went I didn't have to sit in my shit lol like I said she's a trooper. I knew there was a reason why I married her.

TLDR: Wife and I were sick. She went to pick up a gram and trusted the wrong fart on the way. Waited 30 minutes in that outfit for dboy to drop off. She is amazing. And I am going to hell

Edit: We know we are shitty parents no pun intended honestly, but we are working to make ourselves better. Both partners have to want it equally but I think I have guilt tripped her enough times that she understands it isn't for our health as much as it is for our son's.

Is this common? The emotional feelings feel significantly more amplified than I'd expect, and I have some nights where my mind inexplicably drops into a deep suicidal hole.  But in each of these days, I might have an hour or three where I actually seem to be in a good mood.

My habit was really mild... low dose PST mostly, 1-6 times per week for 4 months.  Been physically dependent in years past but always just very small habits.  No diarrhea or vomiting or anything like that. 

It's hard to tell because I started using to cope with extreme emotions from major shit going on.  Is it doubtful that wds are contributing to my emotional state?  Or might it be amplifying my underlying grief?  I've always been fairly neurotic and emotional (now I'm a 33 something year old male) but not like this, but I'm going through a lot more than usual at the same time.

EDIT: Dosing makes my emotional state significantly better for 48 hours or so.  The doses are too small to get a good high, but it makes a huge difference emotionally.

Bang my sub then bang that nicotine/xanax syrup away and instantly the nicotine is overwhelming (it is a powerful stimulant after all, especially so concentrated), heart pounding like i IVd coke or some shit, luckily I still got the benzo rush but for 5-10 min I was doubles over dry heaving until the xanax overpowered my sweating dumb ass. The alprazolam rush was crazy though, just instant relaxation. Too bad the nicotine overtook it almost entirely (imagine buzzing off of 20 cigs in a row but instantly) Chugged some Kombucha and passed the fuck out from 5am-10:30am. Interesting experience..

Think I could help I've never had a abscess or had a vein collapse with round about 15 years of daily IV use with a couple of year breaks in between that time . 
   So first off get new clean equipment THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF INJECTING . If you use clean equipment then your odds of getting an infection drop dramatically . Also new needles are less likely to cause bad vein scarring and leads up to the vein collapsing . Needles can be got at chemists, drop in centres or in the states places like Walmart etc though it is at their discretion but I personally wouldn't leave the store until they sold me what I wanted and would lecture them on a little thing called harm reduction . Though if people in your life don't know your using heroin you may not want to cause a scene .Especially if you live in a small town etc As the brain dead like nothing more than to gossip about others . 
Places to order equipment : http://www.eastcoastmedicalsupply.com/?gclid=COCYqavVmsoCFcgYGwodZqIHXA

2nd http://www.bulksyringes.com

3rd (uk) http://www.exchangesupplies.org They ship worldwide and is where most exchanges/chemists etc get their supplies in the UK . A good thing to order is the one hit kit . Comes in a sealed plastic bag and contains a one ml fixed needle with a micro filter built into the cap , a disposable spoon/cooker and a roll up filter though it's not needed because of the micro filter in the needle ,alcohol wipe , sachet of citric acid (only for #3 heroin & only use 1/3rd of the sachet for 0.2/0.3g or a uk ten pound bag as the citric acid is pretty strong and a whole sachet is far to much and you'll get a citric burn/histamine reaction up your arm . 5ml water amp .The pack can be bought for 48p individually or 32p each if you buy 100 . http://www.exchangesupplies.org/shopdisp_frontier-one-hit-kit.php This only applies to people in the states that don't have an NHS .You can pick up the needle packs for free at any uk chemist . 
     So you've got your equipment and picked up your dope . First make sure you've actually been sold heroin give it a visual inspection and maybe taste a little bit it should be quite bitter and have a heroin taste . 
     Next make sure your area is clean for prepping your shot . Take out the spoon, nededle etc from the pack and put the disiered amount on the spoon normally about 0.2 g up to a half G depending on your tolerance and if you have an idea how strong the dope is if you've bought it before from the same person or the same stamp etc . 
                   If it's ECP just add water normally 60/70 units same with BTH and a little heat ,you may want to add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to the heated solution to balance the Ph of the BTH mix as it can be quite acidic and it is the most crudest form of heroin and can contain unwanted substances etc so micro filtering it is a MUST ! If you want to keep your veins in tip top condition . #3 heroin add your H to the spoon and open a citric sachet and add 1/3rd or a fourth of the powder to the spoon then add water from your amp about 60/70 units give it a little stir with the end of the syringe then add a little heat and the solution will go clear and be a brown almost black solution . 
      Then take your syringe and place it up right in the spoon and draw the plunger up . http://imgur.com/9TOO2si  If your using a cigarette filter or roll up filter (recommended) or a cotton ear bud(NOT RECOMMENDED) make sure the eye of the needle is facing down towards the ground and place it on your filter make sure the hole (eye) is facing the correct way and is against the filter so it's properly filtered and draw up the plunder slowly till all the solution is drawn up .
       Next carefully pull the plunger up and down to dislodge any air bubbles clinging to the side of the barrel . Slowly push up the plunger and tap the barrel so any bubbles go to the top and push out any air . 
       Small air bubbles won't do you any harm unless the air contains a lot of bacteria etc then you should be more worried about breathing that air ! The air bubble injected in to someone to kill them is nothing more than an urban myth and your circulatory system simply doesn't work like that IE  un-oxygenated blood needs to go to your lungs first to get oxygen any small air bubbles would be no problem for your lungs to deal with .
        Next find a suitable vein crook of your arm is good or if your injecting multiple times a day start near your hands or if you have a steady hand and your good at getting yourself start with your hands and work your way up your arm with each injection then the next day use your other arm and repeat the process . Vein map of the veins in your hand and the crook of your arm : http://imgur.com/a/lZEaI 
              Get a tourniquet or belt ,rope etc and tie your arm off if needed . Once you've found a vein go into it at a very slight angle almost flush with your skin as you don't want to go deep and run the risk of hitting an artery where the blood will be bright pink(oxygenated) and a little frothy and the pressure maybe enough to push the plunger up . If this happens STOP IMMEDIENTLY !! DO NOT PUSH ANY OF THE HIT INTO THE ARTERY !! Take out the needle and apply pressure to the area and seek medical advice .
                 If youre in a vein check by carefully pulling up on the plunger (registering) to see if any dark red blood goes into the barrel if not take the needle out your arm and try a couple of millimetres up or down from where you first tried . If you don't register right away DO NOT pull the needle out half way and change the angle slightly and push the needle all the way in . This is just butchering your arm and causing unnecessary damage the amount of people I see doing this is unbelievable ! If you don't register take the needle right out and try again at another site ! 
              Once you have a good register release the tourniquet carefully so you don't come out the vein http://imgur.com/05xonaT  Slowly push down the plunger there should be no pain or stinging if there is make sure your in the vein by slowly pulling up on the plunger and blood should go into the barrel . Sometimes a shot is a little to acidic and may sting even though you are in just check your in and you should be good . If it is a new batch or you haven't had any opiates for 3/4 days your tolerance will have dropped and you should only push in half the shot and wait for 30 seconds to see how strong it is . If you feel your good push in the rest . Take out the needle and wipe with a Alchol wipe and apply a lil pressure to the site for 30 seconds and you should be good . üòäüòäüòä

 Some tips only go in your hands if you are confident about getting yourself and you rarely miss as missing in your hands will be painful and will make your hands swollen and you also run the risk of infection . Prolonged use/misses in your hands will eventually make your hands like stubby lil sausages in the best case scenario .
          I wouldn't recommend going in your legs or feet as the circulation is a lot slower and injuries take longer to heal and your feet ain't exactly the cleanest part of your body and it's one of the hardest working so a infection on or near your feet is going to be made worce because your on your feet all day etc . 

 Going in your groin is a very bad idea if you don't know what your doing even though I've done it myself to give my arms a rest it's not a good idea as you have a one in three chance of fucking it up ! 1 you hit the artery (bad) you hit the nerve (extremely painful) or you hit the vein and your good . And if you've burned through all your veins then you definetly don't have the best injecting technique and will more than likely fuck it up and loss your leg . I won't do a groin injecting thread since it is pretty dangerous and having a constant open wound down there isn't a good idea .Though you can get information online or drop in centres will give you advice or you could go to your doctor an ask them for advice they might even mark the vein for you . If you're at this stage you might want to consider plugging ,snorting or smoking as your IV days are numbered . 
    Hope this helps some folks and remember the most important thing about IVing is clean new equipment ! Happy nods peeps !

A little background. I've been on subs for wayyyy too long. Started at 20mg and now at 4. It's going on probably 8 years although the first couple years I had my occasional binges that lasted about a month maybe once a year. After I finished school a few years ago I vowed to try to keep it straight. But now it's been a few years, I have a good job and got everything I wanted but am so damn bored and depressed. I know it's mostly for being on subs for so long but I'm trapped. I work stupid amount of hours a week and can't get more than 3-5 days off work at a time. And from what I've read sub Wd can be pretty nasty. There's no way I'm getting through Wd in 5 days. And I'd rather stay on subs for life than quit this job. 

I know this is prob the addict in me talking but was thinking about setting up a binge and then cold turkey from there. I'd give anything for a normal Wd cycle.  I know y'all are going to say how do you know you'll be able to stop. I guess I don't. But I do have much better self control these days. I always loved my uppers almost as much as dope and been playing with them since my last binge and even after years I keep it to weekends.  But worse case scenario is I have a binge and then get back on subs at a lower dose. I'm finding it incredibly hard to taper any further than where I'm At right now. In the past the big drops of sub doses I had were after my binges. 20 to 12. 12 to 8 and 8 to 4. What I would love more than anything is to get off them and chip on the weekends even though I now have no connects anymore not even a remote lead so even if I want I dunno how I would. Cravings are getting pretty bad.

I looked around at previous posts and couldn't find an answer. How hard is it to OD by sniffing H? It seems way more common to hear of people OD'ing by the needle. 

I am sure there are a lot of variables that go into this (amount used, quality, tolerance, etc), but I was just wondering if anyone knows of anyone that has OD'ed by snorting alone.

*But* I told him I'd give him some vicoden if he needed to sleep, because I know how shitty weedless nights can be for people that use. He'd never tried them before, but said yeah, he'd actually love to try them.

So I explained what the high would be like, told him to read some bluelight and erowid stories about vicoden beforehand (gotta educate yourself before putting things in your body lol) and that they can be highly addictive. He listened and did what I asked.

So I give him two 10's. He texts me about an hour later saying thanks, that he's really enjoying the high, yadda yadda.

Now it's the next night. He says he wasn't able to get any weed, as his guy is still MIA. He's asking for more Vicoden, and is willing to pay for them this time. He says they helped him sleep pretty well last night, and the back pain he usually has was gone. I told him I'd get back to him.

Should I give him more? He's an adult, with a good job, and knows the risks. But this is exactly how I got addicted. Granted, he's probably mentally stronger than I am when it comes to addiction, but still.

currently i have a 900-1300mg (.9-1.3g) U47700 habit, all nasally via nasal spray.

i plan to kick next weekend, starting right after work on friday. hopefully my boss will give me monday off aswell (tho u47 withdrawals are fast, and i was fine in 48 hrs previous times tho never with a habit this large).

anyways my question is - could i spend this coming week lowering my tolerance to hopefully make my w/ds less brutal?  basically id only dose u47700 when id feel the beginning of w/ds and only dose enough to make w/ds go away. maybe if i was feeling brave even spend some time in w/ds.

if i did that over the work week would i lower tolerance (thus making my w/ds over the weekend less intense)?

for my week of misery i will have a large amount of xanax (i will use some xanax for the first 4-5 days after my w/ds to help sleep as i cant sleep for shit for the first week or so after w/ds).

also is there actually anything OTC that ACTUALLY HELPS with rls?

One of my best friends and I have recently moved in together. She's a former heroin addict, but had been mostly clean for several years. A few weeks ago, I found out that she had done heroin because she accidentally left the box of syringes on the kitchen table. I saw it in the morning and asked her about it, and she owned up to it and we talked about it. She had been going through a lot of rough stuff at the time, so I honestly didn't think much of it after we talked about it and figured it was just one slip up due to stress. 

Now, just to be clear- we're both drug users, she just stays away from heroin as she's an IV user and says that it's too much of a risk for her to do it. She's claimed in the past that she thinks she could do heroin ""casually"", like every other drug we do, but she said that she doesn't because of the risk shooting drugs presents. I've done heroin myself, but I've only ever snorted it and it's honestly just not something I enjoy enough to ever be capable of having a problem with. 

Within the past week or so, I've suspected her of using heroin again but brushed it off. I couldn't shake it today, so I snooped around and sure enough, she's been using. I feel like an ass for snooping, and I want to be able to trust that she has it under control and to let it go, but on the other hand I feel like I might be being a little naive and should confront her. 

Based on that information, what would you suggest? I figured fellow drug users may have some good advice, as I'm stuck on how to handle it. ",1452403904.0

I fell in love with a man who told me he was a junkie. He told me when he met me he'd been a serious IV user ~3 years prior and that he still chipped, smoking a bit every summer.

The first summer was rough on me, but I lurked here and had you jerks to thank for helping me to understand what was going on, what he was going through. He seems to be a lucky asshole - after about a month of chipping, he did a week of withdrawals and didn't touch an opiate until the next summer. I told him all along, being someone who generally prided herself on being understanding of a lot of shit, being herself more than stupid with risk that I wanted to understand, I didn't want him to hide shit from me, and that I preferred him to smoke around me so I didn't worry. The unknown is worry. 

I accidentally tried it. He'd always offer, saying he was a gentleman, and I'd always turn it down. For my birthday I got an eight of my vice, cocaine, and my dealer fucked up and gave me the wrong bag. Gunpowder is not, well, neither of us had seen in ever in our neighborhood. I guess he'd always had the idea that if he found some it was worth shooting again. I did a huge line as did he and something was obviously not right. The lights were dark and looking in the bathroom I didn't see the scales, the shine. I insisted it was heroin, as he nodded he insisted as the expert I was wrong. I was sick and he was slouching and it was a bit fucked. The next day he pounced on the bag, and I said fuck it and we smoked it together through the next week. Not my thing.

We've been together 2+ years, rough years now and recently he's been depressed, really badly depressed, and asked me to source for him. I did, I came back with a gram of something really nice (again, #4 from my friend). I was at worked and he asked for it and I lied, saying I had no idea where it was, that he'd have to wait. This was selfish on my part - if he was going to be happy for a change I wanted to share in it.

When I got home he started smoking. It hit him really fast and yet, I think in his routine, he kept going. I kept conning him into slowing down but I hadn't had time to split the baggie. With a half hour he took a long hit that he just kept sucking into. I thought he was fucking with me, as I'd been telling him a tiny hit then come back to bed. The rattle, the hissing started and he started turning blue and I threw him down. He had stopped breathing, and I sort of threw into cpr. 

Idunno, I've seen ... what, light overdoses? I've gotten friends in bad spots up and ok. I've never seen this before and I'm sitting in the spit in my room where it happened and at the time I was panicked and all I could think was my life without him. And I screamed for my roomie to call 911. 

He started breathing, really shallowly 9n his own a minute before the paramedics arrived and gave him two shots of narcan. He was ok. He is OK. I can't imagine how much worse he's feeling, this thing he calls an anti depressant now ripped from him and almost dying and he ran out so quick to be anywhere but here, hyperventilating after 

I just feel like shit. The whole sourcing think I already felt morally ambiguous about - the idea he'd get hooked again or, well, OD - and I just feel responsible. No one knows about his past and I told a lie to a friend that I'd saved someone at worked life with CPR to try to pass the trauma out of that blue-purple choke out of my head, and they said I was a hero and I should be feeling good, I saved a life. Of course I can't imagine the response if I told the truth.

I can't talk to anyone about this stuff. I had to lie to my roommate about knowing nothing about him doing any or where he got it. My roomie now thinks he's scum. I don't think this, of course. But I'm really feeling bad about myself. Sorry, this sounds whiny and self indulgent, but I knew what to look for and how to care for him from reading this forum so thank you. I never thought to get narcan but I might now. If he smokes again, but him knowing I have most of a gram of 'killer' white hidden I assume he will.

I guess the worst thing, I kinda like him on h, I kinda like the way he gets me off on it  and I feel like, did I get him this shit to help him or me?",1452396970.0

Everyone seems to agree that at least a week of pills/ecp or 3-4 days of tea to get any withdrawals.  

The only reason I begin to ask is because of those 1-3 days after that there are all those residual opiates hanging around (that's how tea does!).  And I get a slight WD feel(2-3 days post tea), that complete lack of things being okay, and I wonder how stupid it is to think that that could actually be my body's homeostasis being thrown off enough after just one day of drinking.

Anyone else who's sensitive to shit get this?  I'm either going back to baseline and just not liking it compared to having opiates in me, or my body is sensitive enough to actually dip below baseline for a few days.

Now, i always hated the cops when i was using but these days I feel completely opposite. They have to deal with all sorts of scumbags and I think most on here what I'm referring to.

Anyways.... my guilty pleasure: I LOVE to watch shows like COPS and see some junkies get their asses handed to them. I feel so righteous, it's really something else to be on the side of the law.
I have to say though that in recent episodes the cops are way to lenient to most of the drug users.

I dipped the hell out of Michigan, flew to a random ass detox, and decided to get clean. Well, Im somehow, some way, 53 days clean. 

With that being said, my life has been a goddamn nightmare. It pretty much started after I was allowed my cellphone back and I called back up to Michigan. I hadn't been in contact with anyone up there in around 37 days, and the minute I turn my phone on I have a text from head honchos son (my friend that I was running with) ""hey call me when you see this."" It was odd simply because I said I'd contact him when I was able to and he was always worried about us being connected in some way. 

Come to find out, Jesse, Rico's little brother who was 19 had been stabbed 17 times. This happened around end of November/beginning of December. I found out 2 weeks after it had happened. I was pissed. I cried, punched shit, it was bad. The kicker? It was the same gang/set/idfk that kidnapped me and Yvonne (Rico's girl). I talked to him about it and it was fucking heart shattering to hear the pain in his voice and know I couldn't do a damn thing. 

Fast forward to last Saturday. 

Rico called. He offers me a job in Miami from his dad's BIL doing the same shit I was doing in Michigan. Fuck was it tempting. I had to say no because I'm not comfortable running to college towns. Or in states I really don't know, legally speaking. Hes still in MI dealing with grief but sounded so much better. I mean, first his girlfriend, then his little brother? I just wanted him to be OK. 

4am Monday. Missed call. I called him back around 9 with no answer. Whatever. I was hauling ass to get into a halfway house anyways so I completely forgot. 

7pm Thursday. Kevin [not his real name] calls me. Which he NEVER does. I spoke to him right before I came down here to explain why I was leaving. It didn't seem like a good idea to leave on bad terms with a fucking cartel. Rico is missing. He hasn't been saw or heard from since Sunday night/Monday morning. He missed a court date (not like him, at all) and has an FTA warrant out. Yvonne thought he was making runs, and Kevin and my friend thought he was taking a break. 3 days. No one has heard from him. I know exactly what happened. It was just too hard to accept. Kevin files a missing persons report, along with his Mazda 6 being gone. Jails and hospitals across the tristate area, including FL, Texas and Cali. All we could do is wait.

Last night. My friend calls me. His car was found with a dent in the center of the hood, and the back end fucked up, but no paint chips. All of his jewelry was left in the driver seat along with his cellphone and wallet. The fuck? Lovely. 

At this point, I hope he's dead. If they've had him for 72+ hours, I hope he's dead. I know what these guys are capable of. I just don't understand.

I'm so tired of losing people because of this way of life. It's impossible to deal with sober and all I want to do is stick a needle in my arm and make it go away.

As somebody pointed out, the last few updates from me have been one-liners, so I'll try to recap the past few days here.

I'm feeling about 90% today, only losing 10% from lack of sleep. Other than that everything is peachy. I am at work...and actually getting work done.

The past 3-4 days have fucking blown, and it has been a bitch to write anything at all, especially writing anything about my feelings. To put it all in one word, I have just been fucking tired.

The depression has gone away significantly more today than any time in the past week. It's crazy how your mind fucks with you in withdrawal.

Honestly I am very moved by the support I have gotten from these posts. I appreciate reading all of your ""hell yeah man!"" ""Congratulations!"" ""You are doing great!"", even when the post is just, Day 4...didn't die today.

While I appreciate it so much...I also want to point out that I am not posting this for support or for ""likes"" or encouragement. I am doing this to give myself accountability. I can't admit to my family or friends when I relapse...but it's a lot easier to admit it to an anonymous forum. 

I really don't care much about doing these daily updates anymore, but at the start I said I would post a 14 day update, so that is what I am going to do.

This has really helped me, and I would recommend anyone trying to quit to do this. If any of you are like me, you refuse to get real help and have to fix shit on your own. It's hardheaded and doesn't work most of the time, but it is possible to change on your own.

If anyone wants to talk just shoot me a message.

Before injecting the user connects via webcam to one of the sites validated counselors.  The user also wears headphones with the volume turned all the way up. 

It seems like the majority of these overdoses happen within the first 20 minutes of the injection so the user would not need to be connected for the whole time they are high but just the first few minutes.  If something goes wrong and it looks like the user is fading off too much the counselor can send a loud noise to the headphones to alert the user.  If it continues to get worse the counselor could then make a decision to call for emergency services.

There could be easy upgrades to this service like connecting a heart rate monitor so the person the user is connected to could monitor that.  Also the counselor being able to remotely administer narcan or something along those lines could really save lives.

Would you use a service like this?

4. How long should I use it for, in your opinions? I was thinking dosing as low as possible to get by just for the 4 days of withdrawal and then tapering really quickly, hoping to use Kratom for no longer than a week or so. 

5. I have gabapentin and diazapam available to me as well - are these okay to use with Kratom? I will primarily be using these once I've finished with the Kratom to help ease the transition to sobriety, but may take either or both n top of the kratom, especially on the roughest days of withdrawal. 

I would REALLY appreciate hearing your advice & opinions, as i'm planning on ordering the Kratom tomorrow. Reddit has never let me down before, and I'm sure there's some informed people here who could help me. Thanks for reading!",1452474984.0

I hope all is well. I am feeling pretty good today. Thanks to the inspiration from /u/Chiraqboi I got up and worked out before work this morning. I am going to try to keep it up.

I feel like the physical part of this has left me, and the mental is just about gone too. The important part from now on is to never forget what could happen if I ever pick up again.

Since these are starting to get boring I'll share a story:

A couple years ago I met this black chick on a stupid dating/hookup app. I am a middle class suburbs white kid by the way...so I bring her to my parents house at night, and we bang in my room. She had an orgasm and within seconds is butt naked in my bed snoring, so I'm like fuck...gotta finish...so I go downstairs to have a cigarette on the back porch and I bust my nut over the deck into my back yard.

Flash forward to the morning. I wake up hungover and this...kind of attractive..black chick is just completely naked in my bed. It's about 7 am and I hear my parents up getting ready for work. I did not want my mom to see this chick so I go downstairs and start talking to them. My mom goes upstairs and soon after comes down with huge eyes and just says...""WHO IS THE NAKED BLACK MAN IN YOUR BED??? ARE YOU BACK ON DRUGS?!?!"" And before I could even say no it's just a black girl with an average body I just could not stop laughing at her reaction. She still gives me shit about it to this day.

The girl wasn't fat or ugly or anything, she just had short hair and kinda broad shoulders, and she was laying on her stomach with her ass out so that's all my mom saw.

So I'm kind of a drug nerd and am constantly researching various drugs cause I'm just completely amazed that such a small amount of a substance can have such huge effects on our bodies. In my research when I find ones whose chemical structure looks cool I end up memorizing it and drawing it everywhere (mainly opiates, diacetylmorphine is a beautiful compound).  Well my girlfriend noticed this and gave me one of the coolest gifts I've ever gotten, she got me pint glasses with the chemical structures for dopamine and oxytocin on them.  They're by far the most interesting gift that I've ever received and I never would have guessed in a million years that she would get me something like this.  I was blown away and I love her so much, I guess these two compounds are appropriate since i get a huge release of them anytime I'm with her. 

Anyway, enough of my dope induced mushy ramblings, here are the glasses.

I am prescribed 10mg OXY (4 pills per day), so I get 30-10mg Norco from a friend to take in the middle of the month so I'll still have OXY left to take for a few days before my monthly UA. Well...we had a huge NYE party and people were in/out of my master bath all night and I forgot to hide my stash (I keep it on the counter in an old Norco bottle because I used to take those). I just realized that they were stolen, along with some cash, Saturday. Now I won't have any in my system for my UA tomorrow. The only thing keeping me from dying is Lope, Clonidine, and Tramadol. I hope whoever took those had a good fucking time. I won't be that stupid again!

My questions are: 1) Will they cut me off at PM tomorrow, and should I tell them about some getting stolen or will they think I'm making it up?

2) Do they normally test for Tramadol?

I apologize for clogging your awesome sub with these stupid questions, but I've played the game so well until now and I'm freaking out! Hope everyone had a great weekend and got all the candy you needed!

UPDATE: My PM clinic tests every time I guess! Today she asked me if I was prescribed Tramadol (I took it to help with withdrawal). I told her that my Primary Care prescribed it on 9/29. They know her because she works in one of their ""regular"" clinics, and they can see my chart. She said ""Ok! No problem!"" I said I take it for headaches and asked if that was ok because I have a bunch of them. She said ""Sure, Jennifer prescribed them so it's ok. But just don't get any NEW prescriptions for any kind of pain meds from anyone else."" ALSO, they said last month I had Codeine in my urine, but it was the same scenario. So damn! I'm lucky!! She said nothing about me NOT having OXY in my system, so maybe the 1/3 of one I took this morning was enough! Phew! Not chancing it anymore... Will keep a better eye on my meds!!

BONUS: Told Dr. about my trip to Africa on January 30th, and that I only needed enough Percocet to get me through January 29th (when I go back to get meds for my trip). When she brought out my script, it was for 120 Percocet 10mg instead of the normal 112 I usually get for 4 weeks, but this script is only for 17 days!! WOOHOO!!!!!

In all this time I've never had any issue with sex drive, libido, or shitting. So I've always been very thankful for that.
 
Now, obviously I know it's very common to experience sexual problems while on opiates. I just find it strange it's only effecting me *now*...

But, the last 2 weeks shit hasn't been great.

I'm a very sexually active person and I've been experiencing some issues. I have a friend named Gia, we grew up together and I've known her my entire life. We have an interesting relationship, but typically we have sex at least  2-3 times a week.

But, these last two weeks, I'm having fun with Gia and after only 10-15 minutes of sex I just go soft. I'm still very turned on, and want to continue, but I simply cannot because I'm limp. It was humiliating. She didn't even get off (she typically cums very easily) and neither did I. This has never happened for either of us. Usually I last a long time, stay hard until we're finished. I just assumed it was a fluke because I hard worked really hard that day. So I kinda shrugged it off.




2 days later we tried again, the exact same thing happened. So she gave me a handjob to try and help. I did actually cum from the handjob, *but* I still didn't get hard. Never in my life have I had an orgasm without being hard, so that was also strange and disheartening for me. 




To try to remedy this issue I completely stopped masturbating, the only time I'm getting off now is during sex. That *did* help to an extent, I'm no longer having an issue staying hard. But now I'm simply cumming too early. I'm lucky if I even go 10 minutes before I cum right now, it's a bad case of premature ejac apparently...




This whole thing is really messing with my head, my confidence, and just my sex drive in general, it's very embarrassing. I've always thought I was really good at sex, but now my dick isn't exactly responding how id like it to.

I feel guilty because Gia thinks it may be because I'm not attracted to her anymore. I told her that that couldn't be farther from the truth, that she's as beautiful as ever, and that it's likely the opiates causing this issue.



Of course I always knew this was a possibility with opiate use, but I didn't expect it because it's never happened before, even after years of opiate use with a hefty tolerance.


This sub had helped me with countless issues, and given me superb advice over the last 4 years, so I just wanted to see if anyone could offer me some advice, or possibly provide insight if you've experienced something similar. There's a lot of very intelligent people here, and I mean that.

How should I make use of what I have left?  Would I be as well getting high and be done with it, or would it be worthwhile trying to wean myself off to minimise the discomfort?

Has there been any thought/research on chemical reactions to convert loperamide to an opioid that affects the CNS?  Much like any other semi-synthetic opioid.",1452688557.0

What I have done to mitigate the possibility of throwing up is reduced the dose. The other night I thought I was going to be fine but moving forward fucked me up and having a slice of pizza with a little cola indiced that explosive vomit experience.

I met him thru a friend, hung out a few times and started buy in shard here and there from him n occasionally various pills he'd come up on) sent his gf to drop me off a 40 of dark at my work on sunday to help clear me for landing that night. Ended up bein a bag of fuckin bullshit caramelized sugar. Immediately text back sayin it's bullshit but not tripping too hard.

6 hrs after I text n call I finally get a text back, ""oh really? Fuck man sorry I'll make it right"" it's happened before with me gettin shorted on bulk purchases but he's so far got a 100% success rate for makin it right. Smetimes takes a day, by the time I got the text I was already home from work n don't have a car. Offered a fresh 10 pack of some rigs I came across (don't shoot) for a drop off but nope. Figure fuck it I'll get it tomorrow.

Lotsa of weed n sleep aids later I fall asleep, wake up Monday round noon. Round 3 I text em asking what's good and an hour later they're tellin me if I can make it to them I could get it. All my rides fell through all day but one buddy says if I get him high he'll drive me after 9. I'm in constant contact with these fuckers makin sure I'm good to come thru any time and yet right at fucking 9 they're suddenly not at home, one of them is in another town and all their Shit is at their house. They swear up n down they'll hook me up fat tomorrow. I tell em ok I understand but for real I want my shit and I'll hit them up in the morning when I'm in town.

This morning (tuesday) sure as shit, they gotta go re up. So this afternoon I ask if they got it and, wouldn't you fucking know it they apparently got ripped off $100 so they're trying desperately to figure something out. I text in the evening this exact message ""so what's good? Yall ok?"" Suddenly they're pissed. I'm blowing up their phone, they're doing all they can, and (this is a direct quote) ""a handout sack isn't a priority at the moment.""

I'm honestly not even mad, not even a lil bit. These fuckers are just shady all of a sudden. Sure I want my damn drugs but it's almost a game at this point to see if they're ever even gonna make it right. It'd be nice if they do but it's also kinda fun seeing how many excuses they can come up with. I told them that all my texts are hours apart and the majority of those texts are asking if I can stop by their house after THEY FUCKING TOLD ME they were good for it. also, it's not a hand out its you fixing your bullshit. if you don't want this shit happening either check your dope when you re up or keep in mind when you cut your shit you're supposed to leave a little dope in there still. I'm not gonna do anything if they don't pay me, I'm prepared to let it go. Just wait until I get that text saying ""need?"" To remind them. 

Tl;Dr sorry for the text wall I smoke meth. Basically on Sunday these people I know sold me nothing but cut, then said they'd make it right when I complained. It is now Wednesday and they haven't done given me anything but excuses and I just wanna nod.",1452678852.0

We've had a lot of issues that stemmed from our crazy and reckless lifestyles, but when it comes down to it I love the bitch and was glad to start talking to her again.  She called a couple times and said she was gonna call me back, but I haven't heard from her in about a week.  Well I checked the county jail listing today (I check that thing every week to see which of my dumbass friends landed they asses back in the pokey lol), and she wasn't on there.  So I did an inmate search and she's in the Indiana DOC, says she's in the intake center or whatever. She's got like a year and a half to do from a possession case, but she didn't think she'd be going to prison for another month at least.  These motherfuckers been picking up people on the quick from county lately tho and I guess they already moved her.

This is my question and I know some of you can help with this.  First, how long does processing generally take?  I've never been to prison but I've been to jail several times and know a lot of people that have spent a few years in the DOC, and I know that in this state at least that you go to an intake facility to get classified and shit and then they move you to the prison that you actually do your time at.  I want to write her but I don't want to send a letter to her only to have it bounce back because she's already been moved.  Also, how do you write to someone in prison?  Do you have to have their DOC number or their specific cell or dorm or whatever with the address?

I really need to talk to her, because aside from our own storied and fucked up relationship there's like a 50/50 chance I'm the father of her baby.  I've pushed aside dealing with this for a while, partly cuz she fucked a billion other dudes in the timeframe she got knocked up.  We weren't even together or all that close at the time, she was just a dope whore I'd get high with and fucked a couple times. We ended up becoming really close and have had a thing off and on since.  She DNA tested everyone that she slept with except me and one other dude.  I didnt wanna pay for a DNA test if the fucking kid aint mine, but I've been dealing with my own paternity issues and am about to meet my biological father and my half siblings for the first time in my life soon and its got me thinking about this shit.  If that baby is mine I don't wanna put her through the shit I've gone through.  If that kid's mine I wanna be able to be there for her and have her know who the fuck her actual father is.  I've got to be able to talk to this bitch to try to start figuring this shit out.  I'm 29 years old, my life is a fucking mess, and I need to start cleaning the shit up.  She's going into a rehab program in the prison, fucking maybe she can clean her shit up and I can and we can actually do something with our lives and get her and maybe my daughter back.  Maybe not.  But I dont know until I start talking to her and actually trying to work shit out instead of just ignoring it and hoping it goes away.

So I bought a 30 sac of crack and black about an hour ago and was smoking on the rock but always heard you can shoot it. Well I have shot pretty much everything I could (today was a goofy gooberball which had 1mg of xanax dissolved in 20cc of vodka, 3/4 of p1 of dope already cooked needed to filter, and to top it off, the last of my meth that I scrounged after spilling my entire 20 bag on the floor last night :'(  well the ggball is the best combo I've ever banged) 

I forgot that I had an old bitcoin wallet from when the price crashed and I spent around $14 on it. Being broke because I started a new job tried to think of any hidden cash stashes, yeah right lol I'm a heroin addict. But then it clicked because I remember buying the coin in 2012 or 2013 and then just wanted to see if it'd be worth something. Almost 3yrs later that turned into $65 and some change, dream come true. Got p6 of rock for $30 (is that a good price? Not a crack enthusiast, but from my buddy who is claims is fire for the price) and almost a half g of dank black since me and my friend kept buying rock from her this weekend and blew through about $360 in the span of 8 hours... I spent $225 and that was literally every penny I had until my check arrives from my new job, thank you xanax and crack. I understand why they say you literally don't give a fuck how much they spend until they literally can't spend anymore. I'm rambling fuck I'll get to my point. 

Ppl online say the rush is 10x better shooting vs. Smoking but I feel its a different rush can anyone agree? It was a slow build up then all of a sudden my whole body is numb and my eyes feel like they're vibrating. Also the typical bell ringing is so much louder. DAE feel the white vinegar they use to make it shootable running from the injection site all around your body? Idk its not what I expected but of course I'm going to do it again, there's no arguing that. Also is it necessary to use a filter? When I stirred the solution, everything dissolved except a tiny piece and it stayed at the bottom of the spoon, I take it that means it is good quality right? Damn I shot about p1-p2 (shitty scale but works when you put weight on it first)  around 15 min ago and I still feel it strong but am coming down. 

Sorry for the crack head rant, just have never done it and really wanted to share and see if people feel the same as I do. 

Tl;Dr : I'm cracked tf out and want to know if ppl that iv theirs feel what I felt. Also if you are a shooter, try my ggball I mixed up this morning, you'll love it if you like meth but REALLY wanna take the edge off to the point of it being a speedy nod. 

8 hr work day flew by and was productive af. Your results may differ and if u do try it, please make sure u know your dose and tolerance for each. I'm heavily dependent on ops and benzos so I could handle it, I'm sure someone who has self control should not start at 1mg and almost a point combined. This is not a tl;Dr anymore.

Just yesterday Ive come to the realization that Ive wasted exactly 8 months of my life hopelessly trying to bury my feelings from a relationship that ended horribly after 8 years of being with the person who I loved, the only person that has ever truly had my back and never left me hanging like this, has fucking completely left me hanging.   Maybe it wouldnt be so bad if she wouldnt of been pregnant and ran right off and gotten an abortion, maybe if she hadnt gotten a new boyfriend within a week of us splitting up and started taking my 5 year old kid around him so soon it wouldnt hurt quite as much, maybe if she wasnt currently pregnant with this new dude and (seemingly) happily carrying his child mere months after slaying what would of been my second born this wouldnt be so unbareable. 

Ive been doing the same exact shit every single day for the past 8 months qnd its gotten me exactly nowhere.  Even as Ive ""made it through to the other side"", and have 50/50 custody of my son now, I just cant shake this depression.   I dont answer calls, I dont even leave my own bedroom other than when I realllllly have to, I dont even bother showering but once a week, cause fuck it thats why.  My house has never been messier, granted im very OCD and the living conditions are just fine for my son but still its a bit messy.

Hydrocodone, blues, opana 40s amd 20s have been the only thing really keeping me from grabbing that H&K USP .45 and putting it to my head and pulling the trigger thes3 past 8 months.   I have been fucking with opiatesfor years but befofe we split up I could still catch q nice little buzz off of 20 or 30mg hydro, now that wont even take the sick away because of all the opana ive been doing :/.  I guess where Im going with this is that I just moved to another state to follow my ex here in order to be able to get 50/50 custody, I just got a fresh start 2 weeks ago by moving here but my mind is still in the same shit place.   All ive been thinking abiut is how good it would feel to actually get high and Ive been fantaaizing about getting some dope or finally saying fuck it and banging one of these opanas.  Never done dope, never banged shit, strictly a snorter and pills are my thing.  

Sorry for the shit poat just need to vent and get it out.  Now off to do some more bitch mints since thats all I have at the moment.    BTW Faaaaacking opana is expensive as balls in my area.  Anywhere from $85-100 for a crushable 40mg.  God damn fuck me, my new are has $10 hydro 10s a d $35 blues.  Fuck this shit not gonna b able to sustain that for long with my tolly.",1452668429.0

Am I at risk of gangrene?!,"Hey guys, I've shot up about .4 g of Cocaine over the last few hours. I might have missed a few times, since I noticed a slight numbness in the left crook of my elbow (my go-to vein). After my last shot 5 hours ago, I noticed a swelling on my forearm, just below the crook of my elbow. My skin feels bloated and puffy, but it's not painful: if I push against it, it feels pretty much like dough. With this swelling, I've also lost the ability to feel my vein, since the skin is all puffy (the vein sticks out in the crook area though)


The injection site is tender, yet still a little numb. I'm pretty sure that's due to the coke. There is nothing indicating internal bleeding, no bruises or else. I'd say my left hand is slightly paler than the right one however, and that worries me!!! On the one hand, the temperature of my arm is normal, there's no reddening and no numbness anywhere in my left extremity, which should all speak against gangrene right? Also, I heard gangrene is accompanied by pain. Is that right? Like I said above, I can move my arm freely and I only feel a very slight dull throbbing when I push my vein down.

How should I dose? Obviously start small, but how small compared to for example a toothpick? How does the high compare to orally taken oxys?(which I haven't tried either)
I'm relatively poor, accessing more opiates would be pretty hard and obviously my life isn't perfect.

If you have attended a rehab treatment center please read, answer some of the questions in the post and share your overall experience.


In my introduction to /r/opiates I mentioned that I'am a compulsive gambler and pill popper.  While I know popping pills is not the answer they are issued legally by my doctor and I don't feel they are a major concern.  The biggest issue in my life is gambling. I'm a compulsive gambler and have ruined my life and have caused pain to most of those around me.  In the past 5 years i've lost over 500k and recently I have almost put my company into bankruptcy.

I know i need help and for the first time in my life I'm ready to get the help i need.  I'm going to be checking into a 30 day rehab facility and I wanted to gain some knowledge from those here.

Gambling is not viewed in american culture the same as alcohol and drug abuse (which is insane because its a real addiction)and being as such there are very few gambling only treatment centers.  Those gambling only facilities cost a pretty penny and seeing as I'm dead broke right now they are not an option.

What is an option is the healthright360 facility in SF.  This is a addiction treatment facility covering the full gambit of addiction.  Of the 120 beds only five are dedicated to gamblers.  My questions and concerns are as follows.

Many of the residents at the facility are court ordered or are a part of their release from prison.  What that tells me is many of the residents are not there on their own accord.  This fact bothers me because I want and need help and really want to spend my days around people in the same mind set.  I'm not afraid at all to be around addicts and criminals but I'd prefer to be around addicts and criminals that actually want help and are not there passing their time because the court said.

Questions

How was your experience at rehab?

What was it like being around many that didn't actually want help?

What did you learn while at the facility and how did it help you in your life after rehab?

Were you able to stay clean after rehab?

Did you feel like the rehab was worth it?

If you were a court ordered rehab participant please share your thoughts and explain the mind of yourself and those around you in the same position?

Please share anything and everything you can about the experience.  I want to learn from each of you because you have walked in the shoes I'm about to walk.  Thanks for your time.

I have completed my IOP and I'm doing very well.  I decided to post today because I heard through  the grapevine of one of my old user friends death by overdose and it hit me pretty hard.  On day one I did what I had to do to stay clean which was cut off all contacts from my friends.  Deleted and blocked numbers, closed my Facebook  and then changed my phone number.  U never even visit my hometown anymore because not only could I end up in a spot to be tempted to use again but the other reason was seeing old friends who are currently  destroying their lives to chase a fix was too much to handle.  After hearing about my friend through my grandfather over the phone who read about it in the obituary  column I kinda broke down.  I know staying in contact  with him wouldn't have changed his actions and most likely I'd still be shooting up if I did but it still hurt.  This is my first death of somebody very close to me that was a victim of the life so to speak.  Before I changed my number I had him blocked and those txts do t go away they just get sent to blocked and I can delete them later.  4 months ago  was the last txt he sent begging me for a free suboxone  strip (I am prescribed 16mg a day.  Am now on 8 a day).  I remember  graduation day with him and us just chilling and smoking weed and he's dead.  He will never get clean and I won't see him ever again.

The worst mushroom trip I ever had was in high school. It was the second time I ate mushrooms and I was with two of my buddies who worked as telemarketers. we went to this dudes house that they worked with..weirdest fucking kid I have ever met. In his 30's, probably 5'-3"" and looked like Beavis. With his roommate..huge 6' fat guy....and an older much fatter woman who I assumed was the fat guys mother.

So we start tripping (the short kid and fat guy didn't eat mushrooms, they just let us trip over there, which was weird in itself) so the fat guy and older woman go upstairs and in a few minutes you hear the bed creaking...ee er ee er ee er...disgusting.

Then this short dude gets drunk and makes a meal of uncooked runny eggs and uncooked sausage. I'm about to fuckin puke at this point.

The weird fuck picked up a stray German Shepard off the side of the road the week before and it was fucking insane. Patches of hair missing and everything. Dude lets the dog in and it immediately runs to me and starts relentlessly humping me, and I am peaking on my trip at this point.

My buddy is trying to smoke a bowl, but this short fucking drunk dude will NOT give him the only lighter in the house. He just keeps saying ""no no no"", so my buddy is literally cocked back about to punch him in the face, I'm being attacked by this German Shepard while my other buddy is yelling ""just punch it in the face man just punch it in the face""

I just fucking lost it. I screamed at the top of my lungs (imagine Charlie from Always Sunny) ""AHHHHHH IM GETTING THE FUCK OUT OF HERE""

I sprinted out the door and left my friends and drove home (I originally drove them there). I turned my phone off and went home, still tripping hard as fuck, and watched videos on YouTube of people riding rollercoasters.

I woke up the next morning in my bed confused...with a whole strawberry sitting in my cheek like a chipmunk. I guess I thought I would want it in the morning",1452786525.0

I have been clean for 29 months now - before that I used opiates more than I went to my actual job. Needless to say I fucked up my life financially...but let me tell you my story - I'll start when it got bad. 

*****

**Christmas Time - 2011**

My new fiancee and myself are preparing to welcome our first son into the world. What a great gift!!!! One would think, right? for me - this was the start of my downhill spiral and my dance with an opiate addiction.

Until this point - the birth of my first son - I had only ever smoked pot and drank. I had a summer of moderate to heavy cocaine use in  2006 and have taken my fair share of pain killers, uppers, and downers, mushrooms, acid - pretty much everything except meth and heroin over the years. But thats beside the point. 

My pot smoking had always been a concern of my SO's(significant other's). She didnt do it and she didnt like it. Especially now that we had a kid on the way - granted I never ever smoked in the house - always outside or the car. Regardless - being the caring person I am, and the soon-to-be father, I vowed to stop smoking pot when my son was born. 

Little did I know that my vow to give up one drug would quickly push me into the grasp of another. Within a week of my sons birth - and the execution of my vow to quit pot, I had taken my first perk 30. Snorted. It felt great but made me semi-sleepy within 30-45 mins. I did another, recalling that eventually I overcame the munchies and tiredness when I first started smoking pot and it almost had an alternate affect - keeping me awake. 

*****

**Fast Forward - March 2013**

I'm getting married. Everything has been finalized, the venue, DJ, food, paid for. Everything is set. I have my bachelor party the night before the wedding at the private bar in town I was a member at. Just a few friends drinking heavily and playing darts. I hadnt used at all in the past 48 hours with all the family dinners and partying going on. I reminded my one groomsman, which was my closest using buddy, to bring a few perks to the wedding as we all departed the bar - he acknowledged and we went on our ways. 

*Morning of the Wedding* 

My groomsmen show up at my parents house and the limo arrives - of course the one groomsman I was waiting for was the last to show and late as usual. 

HE DIDNT HAVE THEM. HE DIDNT HAVE ANY PERKS. 

The day of the wedding was the second or 3rd day I had gone without using at that time and man the withdrawal was terrible. My advice, do not try to enjoy a wedding with family and friends while going through withdrawal. I was miserable, left early, half ass fucked my bride at our hotel, and stayed up all night tossing, turning, and sweating. I was probably in and out of the shower 4 or 5 times that night.

At this point in my addiction I went from a 1-2 pill per week social habit to a 700$+ a day habit because I chose to stick to pills rather than move to the cheaper heroin. Needless to say, at this point in my addiction, I ran out of things to steal from work, family, and friends, even myself - but i'll tell you right now, using fucked me up. 

*****

**April 2013** our honeymoon - a cruise to the Bahamas WHOOO HOOO.......

not so much - instead of a few days of no pills this was a week stuck in the middle of the ocean and various islands. I'm miserable a day in...tried to turn to alcohol to replace my feelings and emotions with numbness. This only made me more depressed and upset. I sat around crying - not wanting to do anything. I'm miserable. My wife is miserable. We have excursions (adventures at our stops we had planned - kayaking, swimming with dolphins, seeing Atlantis, etc.) I did not want to do any of them.  

The two moments that are supposed to be toward the top of your list of happiest life moments suddenly ranked at the bottom of mine. I was miserable, withdrawing, angry, hostile, sad, depressed, at times - suicidal (any sharks out there in the ocean?). It was bad. 

We returned home from our honeymoon vacation - i run right to the dealer the minute we get our stuff out of the car. I feel better but only for so long. I spent huge amounts of money on alcohol on the boat and after a night and a half handful of pills later, I was broke - work didnt pay until the following week, I had nothing to steal and pawn. I thought for sure I was going to kill myself the next day. 

But alas - I'm an addict. I find a way to get what I need for the day. But I could only hang on to it all for so long. 

*****

**August 7, 2013**

Nothing left to steal. Nothing left to pawn. Rent is 2 months past due. Car insurance hasnt been paid. We have 3 diapers left. My son has an ear infection. Tensions are high. Oh did I mention that every penny we got from our wedding (over $7k) is gone. Smashed up, lined up, and snorted. Right up my nose. I'm closer to suicide than I had ever been to that point. I stole over 40k from my employer, left there for another job that had medical benefits, got found out, threatened with 20+ years of jail time (which my parents had bailed me out by paying them back in full - I told them it was a loan that I wasnt able to pay back because I had left the job and it was no longer coming out of my weekly pay - i thought i was so smart and that they would buy it). My relationship with my wife is in the tubes. I've dipped out on the couch to wake up to my son holding 2 knives nearly the size of him and walking around. Ive chosen drugs over my wife, my son, my family, ~~my friends~~ I had no friends. 

I'm on my way to my parents house with my wife and son in the car. My plan is to tell them. Tell them i need help. Tell them everything I had done. Admit my fault in the entire thing. I sit there in front of my family - basically an intervention I was throwing myself. I admit everything ive done - where all the money went. Where my mom's fathers' jewelry rent - her last remaining memory of him. Gone. Where my dad's italian gold went. Gone. This scumbag came clean about everything. About it all. 

I called a detox/rehab. Was assessed over the phone. Was committed to going to rehab...only issue - they didnt have a bed until the coming Tuesday - August 7th 2013 was a Wednesday. I hung up the phone, lied to my parents and wife again. Ran home. Sold my PS3 and all its games and accessories and went and bought as many perks as I could. One last bang. 

That lasted a few hours and I was out of pills again. And for the second time in my short, quickly progressing addiction to pain pills, I was going through withdrawal. This time, in my own home, under close watch by my wife and her friends. I laid in bed until tuesday morning when I was shuffled into my car and driven in an outright downpour to rehab. Because I hadnt used since the 7th (5 days earlier) I was directly admitted into rehab (no detox for this guy) where I stayed for another 21 nights, slowly, surely getting better. Eating right again. Pooping normally. I actually felt good getting out of bed instead of a fight against aches and pains to get moving. I showered. I brushed my teeth and washed my clothes. 

*****

**September 2013**

I completed the rehab program and was home. The first day I got out of rehab, I hit an NA meeting that night and have been going to meetings ever since. I even returned to the rehab I attended, not once, but twice, to speak to the patients there for NA. 

Shortly after I got home - and by home I mean me, my wife, and my 1.5 year old son moved back in with my parents because we couldnt afford to live anywhere since I spent all our money - my wife filed for divorce. She was understandably mad and upset. She didnt like me going to meetings every night, but i did what i had to to stay clean for myself, her and my son. 

I got a new job, in my field of accounting with a great company. And most of all, I was able to pay my bills and even save some money this time.

The problem is, anyone I have talked to basically says the same thing: ""sure for now, but for how long?"" So, I'm asking you knowledgeable people. Do you think, as I do, that I can keep doing this indefinitely while maintaining my life? 

Full disclosure: The only thing keeping me from spiraling out of control is the lack of access to the drug. I know, as much as I loathe to admit it, that I could (and likely would) lose everything if I had unlimited access. I frankly LOVE opiates and the idea of saying no to them is laughable. But that's sad, isn't it (and maybe relevant to my question). Note: The access will never change. I can say that for certain. 

Anyway first dose in 11 days is kicking in and my Wii U is calling me.

Intro:

We three kings got fire black tar

Bringing good shit from afar

Needle and plunger, filled with wonder

""Need gear?"" Come hop in our car



V1:
Bored and sick and feeling like hell

I bring shit to get them all well

High forever ceasing never

Capture them in my spell



Chorus:

Drugs of wonder, drugs of light

Drugs that get you feeling so right

Once was fiending, no more weaning

High enough to nod all night



V2:
ECP to offer have I

Shit can get a deity high

Poking and prodding 'til you're nodding

Keep going until we die



Chorus


V3:
Tar is mine, it's bitter perfume

Breathe a life of gathering gloom

Sorrowing sighing yawning crying

Locked up in your stone cold room



V4:
Foraging , behold his surprise

Sour-patch kids seen thru pinpoint eyes

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

All of the junkies cry



Chorus

It's going to be hard but I can't see myself without her in my life and I'm not willing to lose her over anything. I'm checking into detox tomorrow afternoon. She's been so supportive. 

I just wanted to tell everyone that a while ago if someone told me I would put something or someone before heroin I would have laughed in their face and said something lame like, ""shit, don't you know I'm already married to the streets!"" 

There is someone out there for every single person here. you might think you're broken beyond repair or that you couldn't possibly feel the way you do on opiates normally, but you're not and you can. 

I've been in a lot of unhealthy relationships. I used to think my dream girl would be this gorgeous ride or die chick that was down to get high all the time like I was. Those were such mistakes. 

this might be the biggest shit post to some of you guys. Hopefully someone reads this that can relate and maybe this is just the thing they needed to hear. I'm 25 about to be 26 and before I met this amazing woman I was cycling through girls and relationships that robbed me of who I was and threw me deeper into my addiction than I ever thought I would go. I put up with cheaters and girls who lied to me about every little thing. My last relationship almost cost me my life. 

Some of you might be younger than I am and are struggling with what addiction has done to your self esteem, your family, and friends. I thought I'd either die alone or end up with someone that I didn't even love just for the sake of not being alone. It's funny how when you meet the right person everything can change in an instant. 

I guess the point is: Dont give up on yourself. Don't think opiates are the only thing that will make you feel loved and special. The hole you may have dug might be so deep you don't even think you can see the light anymore, but you can make it if you give yourself a chance and stop beating yourself down. 

I have next to zero friends. My family is pretty much done with me. Hell, I don't even know who would come to the actual wedding ceremony (we did a court house thing). This place has helped me feel like I'm not alone. I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad about anything because I understand completely where most people are at. I just wanted to share the great news I had and to throw out a little of my experience so if anyone is having doubts about life or dying alone maybe they would keep going and give it another shot instead of delving into depression and masking it with heavy opiate use to the point where every shot you do you dare whoever is orchestrating this whole thing to take you off the face of the planet. 

anyway, I'm not great at getting my point across so hopefully you all can find some meaning in all this and take away the parts that can help you. 

TL;Dr: I got married to the woman I love. There is love for each and every one of you out here. Please hold on long enough to find it.",1452717146.0

As tolerance rises, would it be safe to say that tolerance via mu, kappa, and delta receptors rise in tandem, or could rise at varying rates depending on variables such as the substance used, diet, etc...? The reason I ask this, for some insight, is that I'm currently using u-47700 almost exclusively after coming off Suboxone three weeks ago. My obvious concern is the dysphoria associated with kappa agonism, however this does not seem present in any of the subjective experiences I've read, but the possibility that as my tolerance rises to this chemical, if mu-agonism were raised in an indirect proportion to kappa, the undesirable effect might be more pronounced.

This m.  is hopelessly addicted to opiates of the prescription variety.  This man has never touched a needle or heroin.  He has been dabbling with opiates for over 10 years at this point and is starting to get fed up with the supply shortages that come with the rx opiate market.   His brain is always thinking of that next high, always wants more.  He is both physically dependent and psychologically addicted to the ritual of breaking down and snorting shit.  He has been thinking of playing with fire a d delving deeper into active addiction with Heroin, even though his world is engulfed in flames from previous failed attempts at playing with a fire than burns much less hot than the new one he is considering juggling.   Now this isnt your typical opiate addict, he has always been a hustler on the streets and is very damn good at it, to the point of him buying a house straight up in cash.   Needless to say the guy is flush with cash.  So this where the slope begins to get slippery, unlimited source of income for drugs, no desire to stop, etc etc all play a factor in where this man is sitting in January of 2016.  He has good self control when it comes to money, and ive literally seen him turn down deals on pills when he could easily of afforded them just because it wasnt the right price for him.  He came from nothing, literally flipped $800 into over 100k within a couple years of flipping shit and has been pretty much set ever since.   Seemingly a junkies dream, right?  Nah nah nah this shit fucked up his entire life.  He says he would go back to being broke if he could just shake this addiction.   He knows its going to be the death of him one day, he already hears the needle calling his name and that voice is harder to shake everyday.  He hasnt really done anything with his life in the past 4 years, even though he has made a shit load of money in this time frame (upwards of 500k, easily), bought a house, new car, etc, his family thinks he is doing well with the new business he opened up a few years ago, if only they knew that business was importing and selling bulk amounts of drugs...  if he has learned one thing over the past few years of being what society would call ""rich"", its that money cant buy you happiness.  If youre already unhappy and become rich, youll most likeley be a miserable rich person, on the other hand if life is great and then you become rich, youll have a fucking sweet life.  I mean we all know life is a bit easier when we dont have to worry about bills, pills, or being able to afford whatever you want, he is a modest guy and has reasonable wants and needs, doesnt need anything over the top.  This guy pushed away most of his family and friends for the sake of money, as long as he can remember he has wanted to not have to work his ass off like his parents did just to have nothing, he has wanted to be rich his entire life and now that he has some money he is sure it will be the death of him.  If he had one piece of advice for someone thinking of trying opiates, he would tell them to enjoy the weed and drinking on the weekends with friends while he still has the chance.
TL;DR:  money doesnt buy happiness, it actually buys you sorrow in this fucked up lifestyle we all choose to live.  Hug your parents, brothers, sisters, children, theyre all youve got in this world and one day they will be gone.  DONT FUCKING START DOING OPIATES.  Mo' Money, Mo' Problems.

When I was a kid my cousins and I used to vandalize the fuck out of construction sites, and just shit in general. We would sneak into houses that were being built, and we would all find a sneaky place to take a shit. Then we would just trash the place with their paint and anything else they left out. We also would would find houses with pools and sneak out back to take shits in their pools.
Another thing we would do is on a Sunday we would go find where they parked all of the school buses, and we would break into the buses and turn on all the stop lights and everything inside the bus. We would do this to about 100 buses, that would then end up having dead batteries in the morning and couldn't pick up the kids for school on time",1452873335.0

The G series are around, 15mg is like $40-55 per, and seen the 40mg yellow boys for anywhere $100-200 per. I've seen the pink 10s and the white 10s (54 814) for anywhere from $25-50, prices are pretty brutal all around. 

The H I've tried around town is comical, absolute trash, and I'm sure there's plenty of rat poison and fent in em. There's some roxis floating around for like $1 per mg I think.

Like a newborn mind, a blank slate, washed clean every day, absolutely content, but then, also ignorant. Care free, walking through a mine field. As though, it's where I've always lived.

It comes to a head now, and I see, what the cotton did let through, what it did not catch. It let some dirt in, and over time it built up, deeper and deeper until it fills my head and heart with this gray sludge. This sick gray shit, slowly replacing my life force with apathy, a pale imitation of a real life. Something I'm not even afraid to leave behind, to lose. My own life. Because it isn't life, not like this. I don't know what it is to live anymore, and I feel like I want to walk away, where the fuck am I now? Walk away from what?

Now, I see the cares begin to precipitate back out of solution, and I see, the harm I've done. To myself, and those around me. Those who will never understand, who I am GLAD will never see what I've seen, or know what I do. To those, that have, and do. I've walked this path so long, I thought it all that's left. All I've seen. All I know. But, now the way out is lit before me. For once, I feel strong, I feel ME. I feel the pride and love for myself I used to hold so dear, and I feel all the love and support those very strong few held for me, standing alongside as I walked through hell oblivious to the horror they witnessed every day. For all the pain I caused, for all the hardship they helped shoulder, I must bring myself back, for them. For me. Because this is my life, and it's fucking real now.

I'm retiring the word ""junky"" now, I'm hoping Im leaving the ranks forever and it's one of those words like fag.. you gotta be one to use it. Like Mr. Garrison.

Thanks for all the support, you guys are awesome, I hope you continue to help and support each other and the newbies and the lurkers and the hurt ones like Boebee and ol Alice_cooper's baby mama or whatevs. People like street and EIS and tracey and FEERN make the world a better place, you guys should hold your heads up high out in public. You're better human beings than most the cops on patrol. 

I will still lurk once in a great while and may even come in to share some ramblings here and there, but I can't sit and read/talk about opiates while I'm trying to move on. I'm going to set up apts with an addiction counsellor and a new therapist tomorrow morning before my bond gets revoked (ha) so I have some pretty words for the judge next week. And more importantly, some tools to help myself get back to where I need to be.

Continue being awesome, and please guys, always do the test shot. There's fentanyl going around all over the god damn place right now and it's some serious shit. I hate how the best people always seem to leave the earliest, so please stick around guys, for the people you love and people who love you.

Also, I had two r/opiate crushes i never shared cause it's kinda embarassing. But fash and street are two peeps I'd totally kick it with.

Just finished paying off one for $300 which in the end cost me $700 and I have another for $500 that is gonna cost me close to a G when that's done. Hopefully getting another job soon but my one job just abuses my hours, some days when my schedule says 9-3 I'm not done til 6 other days I'm scheduled 10-5 and I get cut at 2. Kitchen life is taxing as well which is why I love dope, when I get to save a couple bags for a workday it flys by like a dream. I'm rambling at this point, found an oxy 30 I had been traded for my 3ft aux cable, don't ask the kid was weird and really liked it cause it had gold connectors and a braided wire cover, so I'm feeling normal and enjoying binging on cinema sins.

My brother had two 8mg suboxone strips in the mailbox he said were for a friend. I asked if I could buy any part of them and he said no the dude already paid for them or something. 

Being completely sober and having some cravings for anything, I ran to the mailbox when he hopped in the shower and grabbed one package. Cut it open and cut off a tiny tiny piece that isn't noticeable if you look to see if any of the strip is missing. I never need much to get a high/buzz when plugging buprenorphine. 

He comes upstairs asking where it is and I lie at first. Then he says I can either give it to him now and admit it or pack my shit and leave by sunday. So I just admitted it and gave it back to him, though I said I didn't take any of the strip and he can check. He won't notice any gone. I'm kind of salty at him though because I gave him some valium from my script yesterday, even though it was a partial fill only, and he got a some sub himself from what he had but didn't have any at all for me.

I feel like a pile of crap for doing it though. Why would I make such a risk like that?! It's not something I need right now in my life with all the other shit going on and constantly being broke as it is. 

I'm sure plenty of you have been in similar situations where some type of opiate was in the house or something you're in and you're tempted to take some just because you know it'll make you feel 100x better, as long as you don't get caught...

Kind of venting I guess, but I know people relate to this.

But since I don't have any of that, here's my method for preparing dilaudid for injection:

1. Split pills up into fragments and crush them up in a small glass bowl, 2-4mg at a time. Depends on how much of a hurry I'm in. I usually do 3mg at a time


2. In a clean metal spoon, mix the powder with 100 units (1ml) of sterile saline, stir until it dissolves. Take a rolled-up piece of cotton torn off of a q-tip and drop it in the middle, then use a syringe to pull up the solution through the cotton.


3. Crush up the next segment of dilaudid pills, scoop the powder into the spoon, then squirt the solution from the syringe into the spoon. Stir until dissolved, filter through cotton, repeat these steps until we reach the last solution, then take an unused syringe and draw it up through a cotton filter.

Optional Step 0.8: If preparing a speedball, then begin the process with 5mg of dextrostat at a time, beginning with 120 units of saline (dextrostat tends to never dissolve all the way, it's a major pain in the ass to filter significant amounts (20+mg) but it's worth it)

Is this the most efficient method? It's annoying having to filter 4 separate pill fragments just to inject 8mg of hydromorphone, but if I take shortcuts the shot loses its potency, so if it takes another 5-10 minutes then hey whatever.

Secondly...I end up getting lots of used cotton filters with trace amounts of hydromorphone left over. If I stick a dozen or more inside an empty saline flush and draw 130-160 units, shake vigorously for a minute or two, then I can squirt out 80-120 units of dope solution. I use a bic lighter to heat this up til it boils a little, just to ensure that any bacteria die, and I usually mix in 1+mg of crushed-up pill before filtering and injecting. Although it's POSSIBLE to remove the compressed cottons from the flush, dry them out, and extract solution from them a 2nd time, in my experience it hasn't been worth doing. The first extraction is barely potent enough as it is. Am I correct here, or is there something I can do to further get the most bang for my buck?

So yeah, those are my methods. Are there any steps I can take to get the best potency possible? (Aside from investing in wheel filters, I'm aware of those but haven't felt like hassling with them yet) Feedback from experienced dopefiends would be highly appreciated :^B",1452816084.0

I use one of the sites to complete surveys for Visa Prepaid credit cards and the other one I use to buy products through (you simply use the site to click through to the store you want to purchase items from) and you receive a percentage back. It takes a little bit of time for the money to actually be fully credited to your account, but at more than one point in my life this money has come in handy. I get a few bucks for inviting people and in turn, the people I invite get a bonus as well. Then you can go on and invite your friends for additional rewards, buy your regular products through the site to get a percentage back or take surveys for money. I need money, but this is nothing new. In turn for getting money for referring people you guys also get a bonus from signing up through me. All I would need is your e-mail to send the invite to. In turn, if ANY of you guys do something similar and I'm not already signed up for that particular site, I would be more than happy to help you guys too.
