[Description](https://imgur.com/gallery/a19Yv)

So now I have this incredibly shitty disease called [empty nose syndrome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729612000312)

I have ongoing incredible pain from breathing and this frightening and insidious feeling of suffocation. These feelings never go away and get worse when I exert myself. 

Opiates help me cope, so I take them now. Without this medication I probably would have killed myself earlier this year. The pain is unimaginable. 

I'm scared when I hear about placing new regulations on prescription pain killers, or when healthcare providers label people ""drug seeking"" or tell me ""opiates are the wrong medication"" for empty nose syndrome, even though there is no medication and no cure, and it's the only thing that helps. 

I feel like I have to constantly take fiber rich foods to avoid constipation too.

Anyway, I'm suffering pretty bad and I'm glad I have access to these drugs. The medical industry is just so corrupt and dangerous, I almost can't believe it. 

I'm glad I'm alive, but if I didn't have these medications I wouldn't want to be. Every breathe hurts and every activity that makes me breathe harder exponentially increases my pain. 

Anyway, thought I'd share some of my pain, and thank other forum participants for supporting people's access to pain medication. Thanks guys.",1511526598.0

Anyway monkey water is my preferred ROA and this last pick up is going to be my last before I get on subs. Well I'm disappointed as shit because I only have one dboy and he stopped selling tar completely a few days ago and only has powder now. This normally wouldn't be a problem but the powder is trash. It keeps withdrawals away but the high is nothing compared to the tar. I get so fucking sleepy after railing a line too. Like it has to be cut with a looooot of benedryl. I'm disappointed obviously because I wanted to pick up some great tar before getting clean and get high as shit but now I'm stuck with benadryl cut with a small amount of heroin. It's really confusing too because his tar was fire so you would assume the powder would be too but somehow someway it's a dumpster fire.

I found myself buying a crafting blade last night with intentions of cutting. 

I don't know why I went back. I haven't had urges in years. Im not going to make it a problem though. I'm completely off my meds (antidepressant and mood stabilizer) and have been for about three weeks now. I think I'm starting to feel the effects of that, leading me to  this. I got into a fight with  someone I care about, love maybe. I was told I'd   my stuff back and then we wouldn't talk or see each other anymore. I panic. We apologize. We understand we're both half asleep. I take blame for freaking out. I wanted to talk about it but he falls asleep. 

I'm alone.

I rail my last four bags at once. Never done so many like that. I don't feel pain  now, it's been about ten minutes. I dismantled a razor and I accidentally sliced the tip of my finger getting it out. I feel nothing. I run the blade across my arm. I think I'm on the wrong side because I feel nothing. But then the line becomes white, and red, filling with blood
.
This is similar to registering your shot in a sick way. You watch the ident of pressure on your arm either stay the same (which indicates the actual blade side was not used) or fill and bead up with blood.

It just didn't hurt. Usually it stings as the skin tears, usually it hurts. That's dimorphine for you. That could be dangerous though. I had no way of knowing or feeling how feel deep I'm going

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I'm finally going to get my life back, right? Ha, no! Turns out that stuff triggers horrific migraines. The doctor acted like I was speaking a foreign language when I tried to explain-- I didn't start having multi-day, 10/10, head's about to explode migraines like this till I started suboxone, so it seemed simple enough-- but I think he thought I just wanted to quit the program, and he encouraged me to keep doing the medicine. So I, stupidly, listened.

I finally had enough on the week of Halloween and cut myself off. I went through the w/d's at home with no support. But I was finally free of those awful migraines, though I still had chronic headaches every day. In my experience these would get better as my tolerance went down.

Cravings are still an issue though, so I decide to try an old friend: kratom. It tastes vile, but it's cheap and it doesn't give me awful headaches. So I buy a bag, thinking hey, two weeks off suboxone means I probably have the tolerance of an infant and can start at a low dose.

Imagine my surprise when I needed 9 grams just to get some slight relief!

So I took a week off, again. Now three weeks off suboxone, surely all will be well... Nope, I still need 9 grams of kratom just to feel a smidgen of a buzz.

I am frustrated and defeated. Three weeks of no opiates and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. Is this normal??? Do I just have a naturally high tolerance or something??

Is there any way to make this process move faster? I've tried agmatine in the past but I've never had much luck with it. ",1511478189.0

So any one have any advice on how to get what I need from them or experience with similar events.

Once the plunger hit the bottom boom. A rush so strong like a full body orgasm to the point I was moaning loud and hard because the experience felt do good and just like an orgasm but 50 times better and longer.

It literally kept on lasting for 5 minutes just an intense amazing great rush. I was in the canyon parked on the rocks in privacy in my BMW M4 and 2 minutes in the rush I started driving and driving a fast and beautiful car fast (but safely) felt amazing. Plus I found 2 other sexy cars just racing like it was the track on the canyons, a BMW M2 and a Porsche Cayman GT4 I think and I turned around and followed them.

The music was in too and what a blissful experience. Better than any fucking thing and no cravings after for more like oxy. I feel just fine in the mind unlike oxy where it is a mental high as well and fuks u up and makes u crave more.

Dilaudid in my book is number #1. The high is so clean, the rush so amazingly strong and long and feels just like hydrocodone probably the most content, enlightened, euphoric opiate out of them all. Gives you a great mood lift that's natural and doesn't feel synthetic and speedy and fuks with your mind like oxy.

I first came here after combing various internet resources on what I could expect during my first experience with opiate withdrawal. Months later I found this place to be one of the more valuable resources. A lot of my access has been motivated by selfishness, err self-interest and desire to avoid any level of suffering. 


Beyond that, I've utilized this place as a place to vent while sharing stories for other people's amusement which revolved around me getting scammed or otherwise being disenfranchised by the game. Some of the content was enjoyed by readers but I'm sure a lot of it belongs in a blog. On occasion, I've seized the opportunity of a good mood and creativity to share the occasional Anime or Star Trek GIF and look forward to continuing to do so. 


&nbsp;


Before getting into this shit, I staunchly judged others for being grubby ""pill poppers"" and hated addicts with the highest level of prejudice. Nowadays I can empathize but even I've been driven to wit's end with my ""running partner."" In a way, it's good that I've had encountered a lot of negative experiences in procuring dope through my ""friend"" who is frequently my only middle. Perhaps if my experiences in using dope went better and it was all easier... I'd be more of an addict out of convenience. 


&nbsp;

I'm grateful that I've never IV'ed, am grateful for this place and the nicer people here and even appreciate some of the mean people. 


Last Christmas I was posting about using a spreadsheet to track my dope inventory so that I wouldn't be dopesick when visiting my relatives. This Christmas I hope to be in recovery with the aide of medical professional. I look forward to having money to buy gifts for everyone and look forward to no longer being vulnerable to schemes designed to poach what's left of my money. 


I'm grateful that I did not share the Suboxone that I procured this week with my lying ""friend"". Without it, I don't know if I would've been able to perform at work during the week leading up to black Friday. Theoretically I could've gotten through the worst of dope sickness and been adequately fine to work today but I'm glad that I didn't have to chance it and find out the hard way.


&nbsp;


Finally I'm grateful that I don't have to experience this cold weather in withdrawal on twelve hour work days in a retail setting.


Good luck to all, stay safe, stay well, or if not well.. stay strong.

Quick tidpoint, though I know you are not allowed to post locations, my brother & I live near a major city with an open market. My brother's blood test came back with ONLY FENTANYL recorded. Meaning all the ""dope"" bags he had been buying had NOTHING BUT FENT in it. 

Anyway, he went into detox. After around 24 hours he felt fairly sick, so they were ready to dose him with subutex. This is where I feel like the detox center screwed up. Instead of giving him a small dose like 2mg and dosing him every few hours they decided to give him 16mg! He instantly went into precipitated withdrawal. He was losing it in the detox center they took him to the hospital where the hospital gave him a meager .5mg Ativan (lol)....He went through absolute horror. The next day they gave him 14mg, another huge dose, he started feeling worst again. It got to the point where he couldn't take it any longer and left. I picked him up, scored, and he felt fine. Just think, the fent he is buying off the street had no problem beating the sub blocker. 

Is it possible that fentanyl is such a strong drug that subutex/suboxone doesn't touch it? I guess if he would have somehow had the courage to stick through it he would have eventually been able to start feeling better, but I don't know anyone who has the ability to stick through precipitated fentanyl withdrawal. Do you think any liability is on the detox center for giving him such a large Subutex dose to start with? ",1511624510.0

So I just got hold of a bunch of packets containing Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg sublingual film.
I pop some oxynorm and oxycontin maybe a couple times a month, about 35-40 mg's at the time. So I got basically zero opioid tolerance.
Now, I know Suboxone is some really serious stuff, and if your are not careful your going to basically throw up the next 36 hours (or so I was told).
My question is, how much should I take for a first times? Should I cut a small piece of the strip/paper and place it under my tongue? 
- and what will my high be like compared to oxy? All advice is welcomed, since my only experience with opioids is kodein, tramadol, oxy, morphine and contalgin.
So is it even something I should even consider trying?

Since then whenever I use I get spontaneous erections that I dont necessarily want to do anything with (it can kind of be a nuisance in day to day life). On the other hand spontaneous erections never happen when im sober and even with a pretty girl I have to pump at it to get it going.

 It seems that due to my first experience with heroin being tied to my first sexual experience my brain has decided its gonna be the pills, rocks and powders that turn me on and the women come second. Since then ive been in good relationships with women I found attractive and had a good sex life etc but it always ends with me hiding out in the washroom tellin my girl I got diareeha while im realling puttin somethin up my nose

For the past two years I have been taking 4 Norco 10's a day. I had a doctor who recently retired and now I am being sent to a pain clinic.

I would like to stop taking the norco's and move to something extended release. This is great for me because I am a paraplegic with 5 vertabre spinal fusion and chronic pain surrounding my t9-t11. Being that I have tried every type of pain pill or IV (Dilaudid, Morpheine, Oxy, Opana, etc.) As a person who uses them correctly, I feel that I have information as to what works and what does not. For example, I could take 15mg or Morpheine and not have the same relief as 1mg Dilaudid. I can take 1 1/2 Norco and not have as much relief as a perc.  I am concerned that I will walk in and they will completely shit on my 2 years of prescriptions and sent me out with 3 7.5's a day. 

I wish I would get Oxycontin 2x a day for the amount that would be sufficient, but I dont know what that is.

Is a 20mg Oxycontin sustained 20mg in the bloodstream for an extended time, or is it like 5mg ever 4 hours. Is there a place to figure this out

Regardless, It seems like these places give you what they give you and fuck you if you dont like it. I went to them post injury and they sent me home with 2 5's a day. I had been taking 30mg MScontin 15mg Oxycodones breakthrough, granting it was still acute pain from trauma. It felt like such a slap in the face that I never went back.

So is there any literature or information I can look at on what extended pills actually do? What to say and not to say at the DR (Im used to just tell them what I know and saying ""I am not a doctor, I only know the things that helped in this specific time."" which probably isnt a good idea. Im 31 and dont want to ruin my liver with acetaminophen, and Im pretty tight on keeping my pills because if I dont have them, I dont get out of bed. ANd it has nothing to do with being dopesick, I physically hurt.

Recently I was given 2mg IV Dilaudid and I finally understand what all the fuss is about. That was the best feeling I have ever had next to sex with no pull out in a dime piece. My whole body felt different but it was for such a short amount of time, I just dont get that part. I don't have circles that could get heron or any other crazy shit, and I dont know the dark web so no thanks. Im just saying I can see how that could become a problem if you had a huge ass bottle of it. Only thing is Ive never shot up and my viens are so bad it couldnt if i tried. I am forced to get a picc line any time i stay in a hospital. My Doc messed up one day and gave me 4mg dillies IV before a 4 hour ambulance drive to a spine center... IT took 15 minutes and aparently I smoked my vape in it without giving a fuck. I was ruined for the next 36 hours.



Im rambling because the 1 mg dillaudid i am on is making me chatty. SO In summery

A person who takes 40mg Hydrocodone daily would benefit from what mg Oxycontin twice a day. Some asshole said 30 mg Oxys would eliminate the pain and allow me to stay in my wheelchair longer that 3 1/2 hr to 5 hrs depending.

I viewed anyone and everyone who used heroin, pills, meth, etc. as a lowly piece of scum who deserved to die. Since browsing r/o (admittedly only found y'all a couple days ago, but I browsed the sub for several hours, until way past when I meant to go to sleep) I've come to realize that most users aren't pieces or trash, and are in fact humans, just like myself.

I find myself relating to a lot of the posts here about just wanting to get away from life, to escape reality if you will. I used to do the same thing via inhalents, weed, and self harm. Now I do it with alcohol occasionally (when I can afford it). 

I'm also seeing that a lot of y'all use out of necessity, and seeing this sub promote using safely is incredibly uplifting to be perfectly honest.

So thank you r/o for changing my opinion of a very large group of people, and making me realize that that's exactly what y'all are, *people*.

Have a great night r/o, and stay safe out there.

Grind OP on metal file. Spread evenly over aluminum foil. Hover foil over candle, piece by piece, until it baaaaaaaaarely turns light brown or golden. Do to all the OP shavings. Scrape it off. Abuse it.

*I've never seen that method ANYWHERE else, only on a comment reply to my small-time thread with less than 10 upvotes.*

With that being said, maybe some of you guys and gals know of good ways to abuse OP OxyContin. Below are the methods I know of:

* **chew like bubble gum for long ass time**
* **grind with dremel or metal file**
* **""Coca Cola method,"" or use acidic drink**
* **grind, candle melt, viola, magic**
* **microwave method, same as above but above doesn't burn the shit like microwaves and ovens**

Does anybody have any tried-and-true methods to abuse OP?

Anyways, I wrote out a chapter that was about what lead up to me getting kicked out of drug court, several of the relapses, a couple of the adventures. 

I guess I am looking for critique on my writing style. Is it something you could read a whole book of? What could it use more of?

Thats what happened to my boy Mike. I lived because one of my four ""friends,"" the one still by my side now had the balls to touch the gross throwing up mess of a 14 or 15 year old. My boy Mike he didn't have that. He got kicked out an after party at his best friends house because of his heroin use,  mike was addicted to a nice fake xannax, cocaine combo and then eventually the ol speedball combo. The use was so short before it killed him I never got to ask why he swtiched from the xans to heroin, what kinda rigs he used, if he snorted. Such fucked up questions to want to ask, yet im still here . He just  went home, got just a little more high. Just a little more wont hurt. We've all been there. Somtimes that little bit extra before you pass out has you waking up in the middle of the night knowing you are going to throw up, and that if you hadnt gotten up to throw it up an a never gotten up again. And sometimes you dont wake up. You choke on your vomit until youre dead. Id imagine you know what's happening, distantly,fadingly, maybe wishing for it to end. That's what happend to him. My own fathter being a paramedic had to see the poor kid on his back white as a fucking ghost blank eyed, covered in his throw up, dead as fuck. His own father had to find him. Any day that could be my poor father. Had the find his own fucking son dead in his bssement. Nothing he can ever due to change it. Oh the guilt that man must feel. I'll never forget my father calling me at work""do you know mike blankname..."" It was like getting tackeld by an nfl player. Never knew somone that died before him, I was real young you know. Especially for what we where into. Never expecred the next thing he'd tell me was that the dude I had looked up to from age 14 and on was dead. Dead of the addiction I too had instilled into me, a kindergarten version of the endless banging fent dope that I call life now. This was bout two years ago by now, still think of the dude often. One of the nicest mother fuckers you ever met swear to fucking god. You dont meet people like him in this game, or fucking anywhere. Why the fuck did i derserve to be flipped over, simple thing really, all that needed to be done was somome flip him over. But it wasnt fucking done. And that's it. His friends made their decision to leave, or Mike left on his own I guess I'll never know. Regardless he's gone. And I'm not.  And I've realized that can eat me away like maggots  on roadkill over why It wasnt me. Or anyone else. But it won't. I understand that this Is just life, it must be coupled with death. Like men and women making a child, living and life create death. We don't all make it as far as others, but no matter how far you get it'll fucking get us all. So why so I live while Mike died? Because thats how it happened. No purpose for his death, no reason for my life to extrend past his other than that I was lucky that my buddy thought it wouldnt be smart to let me throw up on my back. The other three kids thought I'd be fine. I wouldn't be typing this post, and Mike would still be dead. And Ive got to fucking accept that shit like a man. Own that shit, or im going to be dead too. Letting the death and loss and pain be YOU kills you. We simply exist until our time comes, easiest way for me to cope.

No on to the story after realizing i had a pretty bad problem and i didnt want to be a junky i decided that i aughta trade off drugs and move back over to amphetamines and then get off of those because the withdrawls from amps arent anything compared to opiates (physical anyways). And yesterday i didnt take any opiates and was fiending hard as fuck and i woke up this morning and took a shit load of adderall and vyvanse plus a hit of meth and now i feel rowdy but i dont feel any need for opiates but i now realize that the amphetamines make the opiate shits sooooooo much worse and the nausea plus the anxiety has made me a fuckin wreck. I dont know if this will work and if i might fall back into amphetamine addiction because i kinda like it (even more than opiates really)

7fmqkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fmqkx/interesting_conversation_with_pain_consultant/,9,https://redd.it/7fmqkx,CaptainEngage,Interesting conversation with pain consultant.,"So I went to the only pain management facility in my area around 2 1/2 years ago shortly after becoming a T10 paraplegic. Upon my visit, I had been subscribed MScontin 30Mg and 15 mg IR Oxy for pain. After visiting this clinic, I left with 3x 7.5 hydrocodone a day. My body was in so much pain and they didn't give a single shit. It was a terrible feeling because I had documented proof of what I was prescribed and was looking for a PMcenter that I could go to. I didn't go back.

After 2 years of getting 4x Hydrocodone 10s a day, My doctor was investigated by the DEA. I am not sure what came of it, but when I returned to the office for a final prescription by the replacement, they told me I was flagged by the DEA for the prescriptions he wrote me. Not for pain, but because Clonazepam is a benzo, and he wouldn't write Ambien but instead Restoril (Temazepam). It sorta pissed me off because I am not a doctor, and didn't even know restoril was a benzo.

While in the hospital, My hospital doctor called for a consult with the same pain clinic that gave me the 7.5s, She came into the room and asked my background. She asked what they could do for me and I said ""I have been getting 10mg Hydrocodone for 2 years at 4x a day and my doctor is no longer in practice so I felt it best to go ahead and build a relationship with the center."" She asked why he wasn't practicing and I explained the story as I did to you. She seems surprised that Hydrocodone was all that I took for pain and said she didn't forsee any issue with it.. Totally different then before. I told her that I have been taking Norco for two years and it is obvious that pain management is something I am going to most likely need for the rest of my life. I said that I was concerned about the amount of acetometaphin I will be consuming over the years because sure, 4 norcos a day isnt bad, but every day for 5 years is going to do serious work on my body. Without skipping a beat she said ""I think you are right. It takes a toll on your whole body, Would you consider trying Oxycodone 10 mg without tylenol."" So basically 10mg IR. We agreed that may be best at 4x a day since I have been having an issue with burning out early with the hydrocodone. I feel like I just won the lottery. I am not one to go insane with my pain pills because each one extra I take is one less I have at the end of the month, but with 10mg IR, this makes me happy for various reasons. Oxycodone effects me different and the buzz when I take 2 is more euphoric than energetic, but as they are IR, they can be broken down for a needle. Now, I dont use needles, but I go to the hospital for recurring UTI issues and various this and get admitted for multiple days, always with an IV. I don't have the skill or interest is using needles, but I damn sure will make some premade ""flushes"" for when I am there. Thats 4x a day I will get from them and have a hope because they give my daily meds while I am there. Im interested to see this play out.

In all honesty, If I do get the 10ir, I will use them like I do my hydrocodone. I dont go overboard, but if I find myself with more than my schedule, I do get a good buzz going. So feels like a win guys.",1511700992.0

Wednesday morning: wake up from previous opiate use (100+mg oxy for the past month). Call my dealer. Patiently wait 30 minutes for him to show up at my apartment (he's a decent guy I respect btw) and I buy the following: 1 morphine 60mg er, 2 OP 30s, 2 M box 30s. That was my final dose. I took that shit all afternoon while smoking weed. It was a great day. It lasted well into the night, and I fell asleep soundly at my parents house.

Thursday: take 2 mg of klonopin over the course of the day, don't nod off or anything at thanksgiving but I did take a nap on the couch with my dog after dinner. Could have passed it off as  normal but I unfortunately drop a gabapentin pill on the floor not a good look. By the end of the day, not feeling wd yet at all.

Friday: wake up, shit storm over the gabapentin pill. Parents very angry, also pissed I spent a lot of money last month. Lectures for hours. It was a miserable day, but only feeling slight wd. I'm out of benzos now and switch to gaba. Friday wds start to kick in hard. I get 3 hours of sleep.

Saturday: okay, now I'm feeling this. At this point I have squandered all my comfort drugs and I'm regretting it. It's bearable during the day, I even went out and about with my dad. But as the day goes on, it's getting more intense. Those er pills really delayed this shit. By the afternoon, I have to keep retreating to my bed room in between family interaction in order to recover. My mom screams at me but surprisingly calms down and helps me complete some applications. I manage to make it to the evening.

Saturday night to Sunday morning: this is the worst wd I've felt yet. I know some of you gram a day guys are gonna call me out, but give me some credit, I spent 1500 on drugs last month. I spent the entirety of last night, from 11pm to 7:00, shivering, sweating, having diarrhea, turning the heat on and off, getting up and down, running downstairs for a drink and an apple, and let me tell you, I was in absolute misery. Can't really describe it but the feeling all over my skin was intense. This was true peak wd. I managed an hour of sleep from 3:30 to 4:30 in which I had a nightmare about drugs. Well guys, I powered through this shit long enough. I caved and took exactly 1 lope pill, 2mgs. I am eagerly awaiting my paltry relief. Hopefully this will push me ""over the hump"" of wd. I find the most comfortable position to be sitting in my folding chair a bit hunched. I'll give an update on how I'm feeling later today. Hopefully I don't junk out and take 10 lope. Really hoping I don't do it. I am sick of prolonged misery. See u guys later!",1511699514.0
7fmbkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fmbkb/hows_this_for_a_jj_story/,18,https://redd.it/7fmbkb,Naloxander,How's this for a JJ story?,"So I just recently moved to a fairly big city that borders another country. I won't get into semantics because it's not important.  All you need to know is that I'm in the USA and I'm bordering Canada. 

So I pick up a couple bundles from this new plug I met (off CL of all places).  It was my second or third time copping and his stuff was pretty decent. Anyway, I pull over in an inconspicuous parking lot and do the deed... you all know how that goes. So after a few wax baggies are empty, and I'm feeling much happier, I light up a cig and I plug my home address into the GPS. At this point I'm downtown, and I live a few miles away in the burbs.  

I start driving and come across a rotary with many exits all close together.  I take the one I thought was correct, and my gps thought I took the correct one as well, so I continued on this road for around half a mile.  Then my heart drops as I see signs for the US border coming up.  I pull over at the duty free store before the checkpoints and ask the lady if there is anywhere to turn around without crossing the border.  She tells me I may be able to just swing the car around and hop on the freeway which is tantalizingly close to me.  I put my bundles in what I considered a good hiding spot and turn the car around.

I make it as far as the very entrance to the highway when I see not one, but three border patrol SUVs whip out behind me and pull me over. There are also agents running out of the checkpoint flagging me down. Immediately they tell me to turn the car off and get out. 

""What the hell do you think you're doing?!""
""Sir, I took a wrong turn and was just trying to get back to where I was coming from.""
""Well you went too far.""
""I'm just trying to get back to x, I'm not trying to cross the border.""
""Where were you coming from? Why were you there? What were you really doing? You're acting nervous. Come with me""

At this point the reality of the situation is staring to sink in, and as I'm being searched head to toe I realize my vehicle is getting the same treatment. So basically I tried to keep my cool and answer courtesly, but these guys and gals have a whole nother sense for sniffing out liars and smugglers.

After being searched and basically interrogated for around ten more minutes they told me to have a seat in this locked glass room.  As I sat there there I thought about how I was going to be spending the next decade or so in federal prison. I nearly came to terms with it then and there, because I figured I had no hope of getting away.  After all, these people are professionals at searching cars for illicit drugs.

Well another 20 minutes pass and the officer at the counter calls my name.  Time to face the music. 

""So we found out of state plates behind your back seat. Care to explain?""
""I just moved here from Boston and MA didn't want the plates back""
""Oh I see. Well here are your keys, you're all set.""

Oh my fucking God you guys, the elation I felt when I finally got back in my car and the nice border patrol lady pointed me in the correct direction to the highway back to safety... It was pure fucking bliss. Better than the two bags I did right before this incident occurred.

I got out of there fast and had to pull over once I got off the highway just to collect my nerves and go over what the fuck just happened to me. I was singing. I was laughing, hell I probably even cried.  I definitely went into my safe spot and did a few more bags to celebrate (and to ensure they didn't just confiscate them). Everything was there and I got away Scott free. This type of thing happens once in a lifetime so now I make DAMN sure I'm not on a one-way road to a vehicle narcotics search.

This story is 100% true and I count my blessings every day since this has happened.

TL;DR - made wrong turn in a new city after coping two bundles, ended up at border checkpoint and had my car/person searched. Made it away and am here to tell the tale.",1511694785.0

Usually at night after I take my last shots I'll lay out on the couch and watch some streamed TV. Lately, I've been getting pretty frustrated when I'm nodding and watching a intriguing show with a plot you need to pay attention to, having to rewind every few minutes to catch what I nodded through. It takes like three hours to watch a 45 min show lol. 


I would like some recommendations for shows that are good to watch even if some sections/scenes are missed. One idea I have is ""shitty""/""cheap"" comedy, like Family Guy, etc, where even if you miss some stuff most scenes still funny as hell with no context. Another type of show would be one where scenes aren't dependent on eachother so much, like COPS, skit shows, etc. 

I have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime TV, HBO and can probably access most other shows but would prefer those. What are you favorite shows for my dilemma and what would you recommend?!
Looking forward to hearing your suggestions, stay safe everyone. ",1511689388.0

I don‚Äôt like taking subs, and I don‚Äôt want to be physically dependent on them. I mean the reason I‚Äôm retiring off opiates is so I‚Äôm not dependent on anything 

I‚Äôve greatly lowered my dose to the point of doing only up to 8mg of hydromorphpne each day for the past couple of days. Before that my normal dose was a minimal of around 24mg or hydromorphone and 60mg or oxycodone  

Yesterday I did around 12mg over 24hour block, with the last dose being exactly 24houra ago and only doing 8mg max the previous 72hours. 

I know for a fact the WD won‚Äôt be as bad as normal. But was wondering a couple things 

I will be fine doing subs 24hours last if I slept for the past 8hours of that 24? 
I won‚Äôt go into PWDs ? Since I lowered my dosage so low 

Since I tapered off of my normal DOC and dose, doing subs for a week max def is  more then enough? 
Specially if I tapped off the subs within that week ?

Sorry for all the questions and the horrible Structured post

7fl6dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fl6dg/suboxone_facts/,45,https://redd.it/7fl6dg,klove99,Suboxone Facts,"I'm posting this as it comes up a half dozen times every single day and I'm tired of typing up the same thing. So here's some facts about suboxone:

**1. Bioavailability** *ORAL (sublingual, aka ""dissolve under the tongue"") IS ONLY 30% BA*. That means when you are taking it under your tongue, you are ONLY getting 30% (or about 1/3) of the advertised dose. If you take 8mg by mouth, you are getting 2.4mg in your system. Sniffing is 50% BA. IV is 100%.

**2. The half-life** of suboxone is 36 hours. This means if you have 4mg active in your system right now, tomorrow the same time you will have 2/3 that, or 2.66667 (2 and 2/3). If you take the same amount every day, the dose active within your system is growing. Keep this in mind, you should every couple of days halve your dose to prevent getting to insane amounts it will be hard to ever get off. Here is a calculator you can use to know how much is in your system FROM A SINGLE DOSE. Remember to take into account BA: http://www.drugsdb.com/resources/drug-half-life-calculator/ It's more complicated to calculate multiple days of usage, you can do it one-offs like this:

.

**Math: How much is in my system after X time taking Y amount every day at same time**

.

If you dose every day same time (or if you dose twice a day, you can ""average it out"" to a single dose for less-complicated maths):

Take the amount you took day 1 and multiply it by the BA percentage (so for oral 8mg, this would be 8 * .3 = 2.66667) Let's call this A. Let's call B the amount calculated from the last day.

.

For day 1:



B = A * .6666667 + A

.

For the next day:

.

B(new) = B(previous) * .666667 + A

.

And repeat for each day. For an example of 4 days at 8mg oral,
 
.

A = 2.666667 ( this is 8 * .3 )

.

B(day 2) = 2.666667( pre-dose amount remaining)  * .6666667 + 2.666667

.

B(day2) = 4.44445 mg in your system after you dose on day 2.

.

B(day 3) = B(day2) * .666667 + A

B(day 3) = 4.44445 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 3) = 5.6296mg in your system after you dose.

.

B(day 4) = B(day 3) * .666667 + A

B(day 4) = 5.6296 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 4) = 6.41976

.

Make sense?

.

**Math: How long do I have to stop taking suboxone to get down to X amount left in my system?**

.


Then, to figure out ""how many days until I get it down to X level"", just repeat the equation without adding A, i.e. multiple the total by .6666667 for each day until you get below the number you are trying to reach.

So to see where we would be if we stopped taking after day 4 in the above example,

.

B(day 5) = B(day 4) * .666667

B(day 5) = 6.41976 * .666667

B(day 5) = 4.27984 mg at the time you would usually dose left in your system

.

B(day 6) = B(day 5) * .666667

B(day 6) = 4.27984 * .666667

B(day 6) = 2.85322mg left in your system on the usual dose time after  2 days of not dosing after 4 days of dosing 8mg orally.

.

**3. Receptors / Blocking Effects**: Here is a chart that shows how much saturation your receptors have (basically, at any point in time, this % of receptors are being blocked by suboxone) http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.net/_images/receptor.png . 

Please remember that just because 50% is blocked does NOT mean ""do twice as much"" 


**4. What is ""precipitated withdrawal""** - That is when you force the drugs that are getting you high off the receptors because bupe is stronger than your DOC. This is true for everything except folks doing pure fentanyl or several fent analogs, as those are stronger than bupe and the situation gets more complicated here. I won't focus on that. See next number

**5. Inducing** - You should induce on subs SLOWLY. Take 1mg orally every half hour until you've built up a couple mg (don't try to do more than a few mg in a day, you'll regret it later). If you start to feel sick, hold off a couple hours for you to come down more. THere is a lot of science behind the slow induction, and you can even take a mg or 2 orally as you finish off the last of your bag in order to have an ""easier"" come-down.

.

**6. Naloxone** - 

**NOTE: There has been much contention in this section. This section is written with the assumption that you are coming from an agonist (such as heroin, morphine, or orxy), and NOT that you're already stabilized on bupe/subs. If you are already stabilized, then of course PWD doesn't even apply to you period.** 


""Suboxone"" contains generally 1/4 the amount of naloxone as bupe. So 8mg bupe / 2mg naloxone. It's put there to be a deterrent against anything but oral. Doing oral, you'll barely get any naloxone; not an appreciable amount. Sniffing you'll get slightly more than oral, enough to make a difference, but not a big amount stil. IVing you will get the full dose of naloxone. Why is this important? Naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal with a vengance. If you plan on doing means other than oral, you will need to wait even longer than you would oral because the naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal harder than the suboxone would. If you plan to IV, it is best to induce oral slowly on day 1, maybe into day 2 (of abstaining from other opiates) before starting to IV, in order to prevent the worst sickness of your life (precipitated withdrawal)

I think this covers it mostly. Maybe we can clean this up and get it stickied or side-barred or something, maybe I can just link folks here when they ask. Please voice your questions you'd like to get answered if I forgot to include anything here, thanks.

I always thought that if I put some clean time together, life would return to normal and everything would be alright. That day never came, apparently, if you suffer from trauma, even if it is seemingly benign, it will keep you coming back until you end up in prison or dead. 
Luckily for me, I just ended up in rehab. I was skeptical at first because I had done this song and dance once before, to no avail and I didn't feel that I was any more ready to quit this time than the last, although the circumstances I regularly found myself entrenched in, screamed otherwise. 
So I embraced those thirty days in a private residential treatment facility, nestled in the beautiful mountains of western Canada and accepted that this was the end. I dealt with the major skeleton I had been harboring in my closet and continued to learn coping strategies for the outside world. 
Aside from the 50lbs. I put on there, I now smile frequently, my skin is clear, but most of all, I am at peace with sobriety and myself. I no longer have to participate in that daily rat race to stay well. I sleep like never before and the change is apparent to everyone that has been around to witness it.

I never really post, even though I've been a long time lurker of a lot of subreddits, especially opiates. Something really fucked up happened to me and it has a lot to do with me being on heroin, so I can't talk to many people that I personally know would understand me. I feel like you all would. 

A fee weeks ago, I was hanging out in my staircase with this guy I've known for a few years. Initially, I didn't like him but we have a lot of mutual friends and he lives in my neighborhood so we got to know each other and developed something like a friendship. Anyways, we were in my staircase at around 2am, he was smoking s blunt and I was railing lines of some China white. (He was one of the few people that know I used.) 
To make a long story shorter,  about a bundle in I ended up nodded out, and when I came to he was violating me. He had his dick out and he was rubbing it in my body I had no idea what the fuck to do. I got up and he kept following me and wouldn't stop  touching me until I finally decided to just leave into my apartment.

 I only told two of my close friends about this, because I was not only humiliated this ever happened I felt I would be blamed because I wasn't more vocal with my displeasure and because I was on dope. We all know the stigma that comes with this drug. 

One of the friends I trusted ended up having a big ass mouth and now everyone I know, knows what happened. The man made a post on facebook admitting it all, but he also added all of the details I did not want to get out. People are still taking his side and defending him. Whenever my friend tries to stick up for me, people say ""you should be more worried about her addiction. Not this."" ""Why is no one speaking about the fact that she was on heroin tho?"" ""Why didn't she just go to court?"" ""No one would believe a junkie anyways."" These are people's literal replies. I'm not one to care about strangers opinions but I still feel fucking sick. He admitted to violating me and still no one gives a shit, or they're actually mad at me and want to fight me and the friend that's sticking up for me. And all of this was spread around because someone else couldn't keep their mouth shut. 

This is the exact reason I didn't tell anyone. I don't know what to do or how to feel.  I'm sorry this is my first post here but I needed it off my chest and I know this community wouldn't judge me.",1511667278.0

The good news is that there is an over the counter medication that protects your liver from the damaging effects of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen depletes your livers glutathione, and when it runs out the liver starts to decay. There is a medication called NAC or N-Acetyl-Cysteine that replenishes your livers glutathione reserves. This also helps avoid hang overs. The stuff has a lot of other benefits, it has been shown to be beneficial to people suffering from obstructive lung diseases as well, and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an upper limit to the amount you can take. I wouldn‚Äôt take the whole bottle, but you can take many with no problem. 

Do not take NAC and then think you‚Äôre immune to acetaminophen. But if you‚Äôre doing it anyways you might as well be as safe as possible. I have personally taken it and taken a huge amount of acetaminophen and I used to be a bad alcoholic. When I had my liver checked for a drug study I was told that my liver function was perfect. 

It only has a 10% oral BA so take at least 2000 mg or so. Anyways, this is the same stuff they will give you if you go the hospital for acetaminophen overdose IV. ",1511661946.0

I had showed up to Thanksgiving at my parents' house, looking like I did. And it was not a pretty sight. Nasty arms, was down to 120lbs (5'11"" and looked like a total disgusting mess, not model thin like I thought I was). I do not remember being there. I def was not showing up to my parents' house sober, so that would explain my blackout state. I heard stories how I told everyone I was seeing the ghost of my dead best friend everywhere- which was true.

So I bounced out of Thanksgiving pretty quick and went back to where I was staying. I had a mattress on the floor, but that was all there was. It was this dark little place filled with disgusting energy of shit and dope and horrible thoughts where I would imagine taking a nice big rig and slicing myself up and down my arms and waiting until I felt cold.

I hadn't been high in weeks. I was basically just chasing back being sick every day. I would wake up and have a shot laid out next to me for when I would inevitably wake up sick. 

Psychosis was coming and going regularly, I was getting texts and calls on my phone telling me there were people outside, told me I was plague riddled, spreading HIV and Hep C everywhere and someone had found out about it and sent men to kill me in order to cleanse humanity, ect. 

That was how I felt. Like a shit stain on humanity. Every time I would cop I would tell myself I would rather just be sick for a few days than do this shit again and I didn't.

So 5 years ago it was just me sitting in my shitty little place on my soiled ass mattress smoking cigarettes, shooting dope and smoking meth or crack, updating backpage ad and waiting for calls.

I have 5 years clean in a few days. I dunno if I want to tell that story here or not. I am just watching another junkie do his first detox as I am typing this right now. Plenty of valium for this dude right now. So he is sleeping and I am bored so hit me up.",1511659375.0
7fjcyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fjcyz/subs_for_depression_any_info/,7,https://redd.it/7fjcyz,-mjneat,"Subs for depression, any info?","Just wondering if anyone knows if subs are used to treat depression. I know studies were being carried out. Ive never really been addicted to opiates for a long period. Longest was about 2 weeks of opium use. I tend to binge for a week or so and then quit for a few months. Ive always abused drugs in general though whether smoking weed or my long term benzo habit ive just tapered. Im mostly clean since tapering the benzos and not even smoking pot for the first time in 15 years. Opiates ive fucked about with but i knew that i was too susceptible to addiction(had a nasty k habit for a few years) to do with any frequency but opium, snorted h and even the subs i used for a quick taper(and the one left over i used for a buzz when bored) after a binge just work too well. Exactly as that video on how does h feel like, everything feels fine. This is an issue iv been struggling with for 10 years but since i quit benzos opis have been on my mind since im a downer type of guy.

Maybe its paws from years of benzo use, maybe years of poly drug abuse but im pretty sure my dopamine system is fucked. Even speed paste, which im not really a fan of, picks me up enough to get things done. Ive tried ssris and therapy which never really helped, pot is kind of hit and miss since im in the uk and not legal so the right strain isnt always easy to come by.

I even traded away my life saving in btc earlier this year(and the price has 3xd since then leaving me down about $1m) when i was stuck inside during my acute wd benzo phase(because boredom, possible psychotic break taking insane risk). I just crave a rush constantly its really starting to destroy me. May not be the best place to post since im not really an opiate abuser (its actually rare i use but god damn i can see the attraction) but im guessing a lot of people here are along the same lines as me. I feel a constant emptyness that nothing seems to fill(except drugs).",1511657229.0

One of my friends relatives was prescribed 5x oxy 30s per day, 3x 10mg hydros, and a few other pain meds to be able to cope with his debilitating foot pain (basically part of his foot is rotting off) and the doctor recently cut him off all of his medications cold turkey. Now he's in severe pain, barely able to function, and extremely sick. Just because of this ""epidemic.""

I feel like this is hurting the people who need the meds more than those who abuse it.
In my eyes, all this is going to cause is a decrease in prescription medication abuse, but an increase in heroin/street drug abuse.
I already know 3 people who made the switch to heroin because they got cut off of their prescription medications. I think this is a horrible sign and a horrible solution to a non-existent problem.

We've had people who abuse opioids for a long time, and cutting people off their meds isn't gonna change that.

(rant),"Now... just a pre warning that im typing this on my phone just after thunder fucking scared the shit out of me. Fuck you melbourne... first you have a hot as fuck week and now its waking me up from a well needed sleep.

Okay so... ive been using opiates for 3 to 4 years now... mind you that i cannot tolerate more then 150mg of codeine before feeling sick... which is why i probably havent moved onto harder stuff... despite the fact that my sciatica aint getting better magically.

I hate it when people say stuff like ""opiates are a danger to everyone. Youre an abuser that only likes getting high"" etc... and i mean... yeah i hate taking opiates.. im sure deep down we all sort of do. Which is why im lucky that im not eating the heavy stuff. 

But this opioid crisis thats happenining basically everywhere.. i hate it. I sometimes wish it didnt exist because thanks to opioids ive lost 4 friends who were so close to me just because they thought they were functional users... they honestly werent since thwy didnt have a job and all they did all day was get high. Sleep. Get high again. Sleep. Sell their possessions to get high again. Sleep.... i didnt notice this until this year how bad they were... they were broke as shit and i offered them help. But then they turned on me and said ""youre just like us""...

Now... i dont know about anyone else but this hurt so much. This hurt more then any pain ive had in my short life (im not dead but i am only 23)

It took me 2 days of convincing to go to this sub... to understand what everyone goes through... and it hurts to come here sometimes because of the culture... people are looking forward to getting high... to play with death... 

I love this sub... not because i enjoy being here. But because it shows both sides of a long battle... youre all like a little family... but sometimes the images are too much and its heavy to see.

I hate opiates but its the only thing i can take for my back pain... i hate when people mention weed... because the last thing i need is to get hooked on another drug

And please dont tell me that weed isnt addictive because it is... it may not be as addictive as opiates but its still a habit forming thing and thats the last thing i need.

Please... i plead with all of you who are deep in this game... stay safe. I cant tell you to quit (and i know its hard to quit since meds like suboxone are expensive or something) and... well yeah just stay safe. I dont consider many of you my friend but were all family here. We dont want to lose anyone else. 

My friends that died due to opiates had a bright future. One was 2 weeks away from seeing his grandmother who was dying from cancer... now his grandmother has to... well... pass away without seeing her grand son.

Please... stay safe.

I beat myself up over this, I was so emotionally unstable it was scary. I kept thinking that if I'd been around him he'd be here still because I assumed it was an overdose like everyone else. Well, I recently was informed that he actually died from tumors and heart issues that he would have certainly never treated had he known. So, now that has been a huge weight off my shoulders that has allowed me to move on from beating myself up and wishing I could end it all as well. I'm aware he is in a better place so I'm content enough. I still miss him like crazy but that will never change. 

September 11th, my birthday my ever so loving mother attempted suicide. She has actually seen the steps I've been taking to get back on track and she has been trying as well. I think it finally hit her that she could genuinely lose her family if an overdose didn't take her so she finally found a reason to live. Which I am actually happy for her. She isn't clean by any means, and I've accepted she never will be due to chronic pain however she is trying and not the same person she was just mere months ago. 

I have finally stopped being ashamed and hiding from friends and family after my very public overdose and have started moving on. My brother that I actually like, not the one who robbed me while I laid there dying that night has started talking to me again and accepting me. Which alone makes getting up everyday easier. I start a new job next month, which is an extremely notoriously hard job to get in my city which I'm beyond excited for. So, I can finally start my new chapter in life. 

But the best part? I have money in my pocket and can keep money in my pocket. 

I'm planning on buying another house in the near future as well. So, goals goals goals. And maybe a pair of Yeezy's if everything goes well lol.

I go to AA almost every day for my alcoholism problem which helps curb all my addictions (I also quit benzos with the alcohol last year after I was taking 10 pills a day and mixing with vodka before bed).

She came to visit me from out of state. While staying with me she went in my nightstand, through my medication and stole my anti anxiety meds (Benzodiazepine). When I confronted her about the handful I found in her jacket she claims she needed them for sleep and thought they where lunesta. Which I told her she could not have and made it clear I am not giving her my prescription. 

She brushed it off like it was nothing. Time has passed and Now I dont know what to do or how to talk to her. I've lost her trust and dont trust her coming to visit anymore and dont trust her word. 

How do I fix our relationship and confront her about her use. I don't live in the same state and am worried she will do something harsh if I approach this the wrong way. ",1511630373.0

I thought that in order to get my tolerance back to normal and have great effects again i would have to stop opiates during like 3 or 4 weeks, why only a one week break  helped so much ? is it because i was only taking tramadol and it's a very weak opiate ?

I get a drug test once a week at my iop and that might be tonight if not it'll be then be tomorrow or Thursday. So like 3 weeks ago when I just had the sub in my system I froze a bottle of piss in a water bottle then put it in a dark plastic bag inside another plastic ziplock. I read online you could store urine for drug tests like this for a couple months and it would still be good. Anyways I went to take it out of the freezer just now and put it in the fridge to start thawing. Well when I did I smelled the urine and it smelled pretty stale that real strong pungent smell of old piss. Would this still be useable for my drug test or has it gone bad to the point where they will be able to tell besides the smell? I know the smell is a concern as well but thinking I might be able to pull that off but just wanted to see what your thoughts were on if they'll be able to tell with the test. Like the nurse will probably smell that it's stale as fuck but I'm hoping if I can somehow get past that part it'll at least pass there tests. I'm almost positive they use like a 7 or 10 panel and then only send to lab if it's positive for something. Any help is appreciated especially if you have experience with what I'm describing.

Besides, with whom shall I share the penultimate quicksphere of this night? 


**Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.**  
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I've been shooting just using distilled water and dope for a while. Recently though, I've been sprinkling just a little bit of non-iodised salt (because shooting iodine wouldn't be the best idea... and I don't buy iodised salt anyway), just a couple grains into the water while mixing, and let me say: **It has made all the difference!**

I don't feel any or very minor pain anymore (I used to be able to feel pain as the shot moved up the arm, for a couple inches until it became mixed with enough blood to not be noticable), the wounds seem to be a lot less and heal a lot better, I notice I don't get the ""taste"" anymore of dope when I shoot like I used to, and overall I just feel better. It also makes sense as your blood naturally contains electrolytes that you should mix in solution which also contains such, I had just never thought it important enough before to warrant actually doing.

So what do you guys think? Anyone else salting the water before shooting? Think you should give it a shot? Share your thoughts.",1511756163.0

If I stretch it, I can usually make it last about 9 days. Tried to chip a few times with very little success. Unfortunately I had a pretty big heroin habit in the past, so within about 2-3 days my tolerance goes through the roof. The last half of the 10 days are pretty much dissapointingly trying to chase the initial high. After the 10 days of bliss I am jolted into withdrawals that seem to be just as bad as heroin (probably mostly mental, but major or minor withdrawls fucking suckl). 

My question is how to get the most bang for the buck. What's the best way to enhance the high?

Also have Xanax and gabapentin. Sometimes I'll add in a little xan to the mix, but that usually results in passing out and not enjoying the high as much.

I went up to 3.5mg again had intense feelings of euphoria but much like the last times ive went up or down these euphoric feeling only lasts for a few days than poops out. its not even a great euphoria its better to describe it as a great anti anxiety/mood enhanced feeling. I am by no means trying to stay on the drug....just trying to get the most out of it before i go into detox. Should i lower my dose tomorrow when i see the doctor? Should i switch to Subutex, would that help create more euphoria?

7frfsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7frfsc/looking_back_pt_2/,13,https://redd.it/7frfsc,MaybeIFuckedUpThrway,Looking back pt 2,"So I posted this last night while bored, felt like posting again as I am bored (https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fjkph/looking_back).

So that was that. 5 years ago today I was stuck in a hole. Stuck so deep in a hole lacking any conversation where I was not being accused, bellittled, blamed, or conducting business for buying drugs or selling myself. Romanticizing killing myself nightly as a wonderful ascension away from all the zombies and insufferable reproducing masses of people desperately trying to make it seem as if any iota of what they did actually mattered on the grand scheme of things.

I had felt death many times before, felt this wonderful healing, terrifying place where I simply faded into the background. This beautiful form and void where nothing mattered and everything was entirely happy and inconsequential. 

So this is where things get odd and I start questioning the nature of my reality and still question it to this day, whether this was an incredibly vivid manifestation of my psychosis or whether I am now dead somewhere and this reality I am in now is far different from the one I originally was in. 

I had stolen a car and was staying in a motel quite literally called State Line motel, which was so shitty my door was not properly locked, so I decided while shooting dope I would prop my feel up against the door. 

So, of course, shooting dope, I have the needle in my arm and am juuuust pulling the plunger up to make sure I have a nice juicy vein. And then I hear banging on my door. 

""""Sherrif's department, open up!""

Unfortunately the banging on the door causes my unbraced legs to slip and fuck up my grip on the rig, and I see my skin tear open as the door is forced open by the officer. 

I don't really see anything much at this point. I remember a panic, I remember seeing blood pouring out of arm, and that it had this nice and warm sensation as covered my body. I tried to get the strength to cover up the wound and put pressure on it. I just felt warmth of my blood enveloping me as I slipped into this sunken place where moving became laborous, my eyes closed, and the last thing I remember is a cold settling into my body as a tiny ounce of my being tried to will me up and fight while my chest and head felt as if they were weighted with bricks. 

And then I woke up. 

I woke up in a place where I did not recognize, I was in bed, I was screaming at the top of my lungs. A person rushed at me with a flashlightas I grabbed for my arm, gripping it tightly and jumped up, only to fall on my side and smack my head into a nightstand. 

The person with the flashlight calmed me down and asked what had happened. I told her I must have had a nightmare, and not knowing where I was did not help much so I kept a lot to myself. 

I later find out I was in rehab. I do not remember how I got there. The story I was told was my brother had found me in the same motel I remember being in, I agreed to go to the hospital with him, screamed at the ER staff, was placed on a 72 hour hold, and then shanghaied away to rehab once my parents learned of my predicament. I had been there only one night. 

We were not allowed to use phones while detoxing (5 days), and everyone around me was a stranger so I kept to myself. I was convinced I had died and was in some sort of fucked up purgatory while Psychiatrists and docs put me on a regimen of lithium and asked me questions about my use and history.

I was having some pretty serious psychosis and demanded to the clinical director every five minutes that the cameras outside my window and in my bathroom be removed. I would constantly receive the same sorts of texts on my phone about people coming to kill me and all that- except I did not have a phone to receive texts on so that was another hallucination altogether. 

I was screaming about helicopters and Spec Ops teams trying to get in to the rehab in group, all while never hearing from anyone I had ever met before and being convinced I was dead. 

So we went to our first meeting. I hallucinated furry little creatures crawling up my legs and freaked out in the meeting and ran out to smoke and chill the fuck out. It was at this meeting where I first stood up and said I was an addict.

My pukey nasty greasy cold sweaty self twitching and shouting in a meeting stood up in front of a 150 ppl and said I was an addict. I don't know why the fuck I did it I just did. 

I swear to God every one of those people got up and hugged me. 

I used to sing to my tricks after we got done fucking. I would spoon them and humm gently in their ears, stroking their hair. They would almost always bawl their fucking eyes out. It kindof got me off. So as I stood there in my shitty self, getting hugged by 150 strangers, I started crying. 

I just wanted something. Anything. I had given up on the hope of connection with anyone after so long just me and dope that this disgusting outpouring of love and heart, it broke me. I just sat there in my chair shaking and crying and not knowing what the fuck that was.",1511745495.0

So I don't know if getting ripped off is par the course or if I just make people want to fuck me over. I've been using for ~5 years and when I was using pills I had no problems what so ever. I'd even get them in the original rx bottle usually. I eventually switch to H a year ago cause I ended up getting hooked (shocker) and it seemed a lot cheaper. I never bought more than a half gram and I thought I knew what a point looked like, so I assumed I was getting what I was paying for. I had several dealers too so it's not even like it was one person. Anyway, I bought a scale on someone's recommendation and have been weighing everything I've bought and without fail every half gram is .35-.45, usually on the lower end of the scale regardless of dealer. Like what the fuck? Is this just how it is? Why would every single fucking dealer consistently be short. Getting single points its only ever 80 mg or something. Yesterday I even tried cold copping at a known spot, got a point and scaled it... fucking .7... and the people going there are definitely seasoned junkies. I'm guessing they assume people aren't scaling up what they buy or maybe that's just how it is and everyone accepts it but goddamn does it suck. Maybe I just give off the impression I'm dumb and I won't ever notice, who knows. In either case, I don't know how to approach this. My town is definitely a sellers market and I'm sure if I called someone out on it, they'd just ignore me and carry on business as usual. I'm thinking I'm either going to go back to pills and just taper down until I can chip again or just use other avenues from here on out cause this is fucked. /rant",1511743719.0

So my main ended up in the hostpital about 4 days ago for unrelated-to-drugs health issues (he doesn't use). He's in his 50s.

He lives with a 40-something crackhead (occasional user). When she's not cracked out, she takes care of the house, cleans, makes sure everyone is fed....basically does mom stuff and everyone generally tolerates her because of this.

When he goes into the hospital,  shes tasked with selling his pills, mainly opana. Well, she isn't right mentally at all. super nervous, can't handle stress, etc. My issue is that she literally has to do nothing but sit there and hand them out. There are only 3 of us that buy anyway.

Well, she got *so* fucking irritated that she took all the pills to her friends and locked them up so that if anyone needs something, she has to go to his house, get the pills (just the number needed and no more!) and then come home and sell them,. effectively making it harder on herself and everyone else in the process.

Today, she blatantly rubbed the fact that we were hurting and that she was going to take her time getting the pills, in our faces. It was 4pm when she finally graced us with her presence, all the while getting texts from her laughing at me for needing something she had so badly.

So she said she had 7 opanas left and the only people, as I Said, that buy them are 3 of us and I know them all.

When she came back around 4,  she also said that there weren't any more left, that she sold 5 to these people that don't even do them.

She's completely lying. Shes been threatening to just stop selling to us altogether and pretending to be ""out""...a joke that wasn't received well. When she showed up at 4, she was tweaking out, jerky motions, sniffing, rubbing her nose, the works. So either she sold them for crack or shes full of shit.

**I start a fucking JOB tomorrow!!** I was counting on those fucking things.

So i got this crackhead that won't sell me the drugs she's been tasked with selling, probably because she sold them for crack, or because she just wants to be a cunt.

I've fucking so goddamn pissed off right now. I haven't been this furious in a long time. I think it's because she's such a little piece of crap that doesn't give two fucks about anyone else. 

One time, she made off with his last 3 opanas and went on a crack binge - came back swearing she didn't take them, and he **let** her come back to live!

I've removed 0.3g so far. I tried smoking a little and it is really harsh but trails really well and seems more potent as I would expect. So I can smoke the .3 and just be well or I can IV .3 and get a great nod. So I'm wondering has anyone IVd the resin from a Tooter? I've only seen posts with speculation saying that since it was burned it probably has a bunch carcinogenic toxins in it.

My boss gets to the accident and sees that the airbag deployed and says ‚Äúlooks like you‚Äôre taking a trip to the hospital‚Äù.

I immediately started to panic, the accident wasn‚Äôt caused by me using opiates, but if they‚Äôre in my system I lose my job. I immediately start doing some googling while we wait for the tow and see mixed answers on whether or not I‚Äôll be tested in the hospital. While I‚Äôm looking my phone dies so I only see a few websites before I have to go to the hospital. My wrist and shin started to REALLY hurt by the time I get to the Dr but I don‚Äôt say a word because I know if I have an injury I‚Äôll definitely get a drug test.

They overheard me telling my GF my wrist hurt from where the airbag deployed and start asking questions:

‚ÄúFrom 1-10 how bad does it hurt‚Äù

Answer: 3. Reality: 6

‚ÄúCan you move it?‚Äù

Yes

‚ÄúDoes it hurt to move it?‚Äù

Answer: No. Reality: Fuck yes.

They informed me that my training class will begin on December 4th but they asked me to come in tomorrow (Monday the 27th) for the paperwork portion of starting a new job. They also informed me that at some point I will need to pass a drug screen.

However, I do not know if that will be given to me tomorrow with a 24 hour time period to get it completed or if they will wait until the later in the week or even when the training class starts. My guess would be tomorrow they will give me a form that will require me to complete the drug screen within 24 hours. I have already informed the recruiter that I have another job that I have given notice for and will be leaving before the training class begins so if worse comes to worst I can try putting it off by saying I am too busy with work and need a couple extra days to clear it out of my system.

Now, my question is, if the drug screen is just a 5-panel test, will oxymorphone and xanax show up as positive on test. I'm fairly sure xanax won't even show up on 10-panel, but I could be wrong about that, but lucky for me that's not what I'm dealing with right now. I snorted oxymorphone and took xanax orally this morning (Saturday the 26th), so if I was to test tomorow or Tuesday I'd most likely fail. But I've heard from a few different sources that neither of those substances will show up on a 5-panel, but what has me worried is that oxymorphone has small amounts of morphine and if I happen to test positive for morphine I will fail the test and lose the job before I even begin.

Any answers and advice would be greatly appreciated! That is, unless it is just someone saying my best option would be to quit altogether. Obviously that's the best course of action and I wouldn't be here if it was that easy. 

Also, as an aside, if I was to start taking suboxone today and over the course of the next few days, how would that affect a 5-panel (or 10-panel test) test for that matter?

Edit: What the fuck is up with this sub? I just wanted to post and get a better idea about what to expect with my upcoming drug screen and right away had ppl calling me dumbass and telling me to shut the fuck up.

Serious shit post right here guys and gals. For anyone who think there life sucks, just take comfort in knowing someone else has it worse. Oh, and I forgot to mention my dad is dying of stage 4 lung cancer and doesn't want anything to do with me because of my drug use. And the rest of my family hates  me because of my addiction as well. I wasn't even invited to Thanksgiving this year. Fuck em I guess. This all happened about 2 and a half weeks ago, I just now am feeling better having detoxed off a gram of fire ecp (most likely fentanyl) and feel up to posting about it. 

  .            .So it all started about 2 and a half weeks ago when I was driving on the highway, high as the dude from the Red Bull jump, when all of a sudden BAM!!! Fucking slammed into the median and completely totaled the left side of my car. Somehow managed to pull over to the side of the road and called for a tow truck, all the while hoping and praying a cop doesn't show up to see this high as fuck junky sitting on the side of the road. Tow truck comes lickidy split and picks me pathetic ass up. Got seriously lucky I didn't get another DUI so I guess some good came out of this one. 

.          .Fast forward a few days later. My dealer Big Black picks me up from my place to give me a ride to work, and gives me literally the best dope I've ever had in my life on the way over there. I do a shot and am wrecked! I serve tables at a high in restaurant and need to be on my A game when I go in. Well, he pulls over and says, ""nigga you is fucked up. I think you should call off tonight you lookin real bad. You can't even keep your eyes open."" I reluctantly shrug off his suggestion saying I go in looking like this all the time and I'm cool, I can't call off anyway I need dope money son! So, I go in and work my shift thinking I'm cool, nobody knows about my drug use. So after doing a 4th shot in the bathroom stall at work I come out of the bathroom and my manager says he needs to have a word with me. He sits me down and proceeds to tell me he knows something is up.""Dude you come in here one day and your totally fine and then an hour later your running around the restaurant like a crackhead Energizer Bunny. Then an hour later your falling asleep while rolling silverware. What's up man is there something you want to tell me? If you need some time off to come off a medication I understand I'll help you out and grant you some unpaid leave, anything I can do to help?"" I break down crying like a little bitch and tell him I'm all fucked up on drugs (I never specify what I was on) and I need a week off from work to detox. He acts all cool with it and even gives me a bro hug ( you know like the handshake half hug) before he sends me home for the night. 

.          .So I call Big Black to come pick me up and tell him what happened. ""I told you nigga!"" Yea, I know Black, you are always right. Tell him I'm gonna be outta the game for a while and I won't be seeing him for some time. I get ahold of a couple subs and start my detox the next day. A day goes by, cool, I'm getting my life back everything will be ok. Then, a day later my manager calls me. Ooohhhhh shit this isn't going to be good. He tells me I'm too much of a liability to come back to work and they they have to let me go. That two fucked duck looking mother fucker!!! Take your bro hug back you piece of shit!!! So I just lost my job and I'm feeling sick as fuck even with the subs. I'm now broke and jobless with bills piling up.

 .           .I tell my girlfriend I have been using lately and just lost my job because of it. She dumps my ass right on the spot and tells me to get my shit together before i ever contact her again. Great, the love of my life doesn't want to be with a junky and I can't really blame her. We were together for almost 2 years and she has stuck by my side through many relapses but she told me last time if I fuck up again she is flat out done with me. So the love of my life is now gone!!! Im now carless, jobless, broke, and too sick to go out and look for another job. And without a car my options are extremely limited.

.          .My half sister has offered many a times to let me stay with her to help me get clean. I was just never ready to before this all happened. I  made a grand a week at this last job and wasn't ever really willing or wanting to quit using. She lives over an hour a way in bumfuck Egypt where I know I can't get any dope and there aren't any temptations. I guess it's really time  to quit for good. I call her up, tell her what happened, and before I know it shes at my apartment to pick me up to take me back to what is now ""home."" I call my landlord and tell him I lost my car and job and I will have to be moving out seeing how there was no way I could come up with rent money in time let alone keep my gas and electric on. Shit, I didn't even have money for food, fuck me! 

.           .So here I am about 2 weeks after all this has happened. I took Suboxone for a few days and then flushed the rest down the toilet just wanting to be done with all this shit. I took Kratom for a couple days after that and don't even know if it really helped because I still felt awful. I've only taken a little Kratom this past week and I feel fine as of today.

I really hate lying so I'm just awful at it. Mom can usually see right through it. But I just can't bring myself to tell her what I've done. I don't know what I'm going to say but she keeps asking. I'm going to have to say something soon,

Edit: For those who are wondering what pronoun to use, I'm a girl.

Edit: I am aware of rights to keep my medical info from my parents. However my mother is a great mom and me very much. She deserves to know.

7fopyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fopyl/mkultra_opioid_relation/,12,https://redd.it/7fopyl,neuroloop,MKULTRA: Opioid Relation,"So I have been wondering.. how far did MKULTRA (Mind Control) experiments get with forced morphine addiction? It is well known fact they used heroin addicts specifically to create mind control candidates and experimented with forced morphine addiction. It seems opioid addiction could be perfect for mind control. In fact as we know it as mind control, whether we want it or not.

For those who are not familiar, MKULTRA was a group of experiments done in the mid 1900's by CIA regarding finding a way to create an assassin and gain full control over a person. It also experimented with interrogations and forced morphine addiction to get results.

Even Bostin mobster Whitey Bulger was a victim of this treatment when they told him they were looking for volunteers for a cure to schizophrenia.

As mentioned they used a variety of drugs from barbituates (truth serum) to forced morphine addiction. 

So I ponder the long term implications of opioid addiction and my tin hat comes out.. what if CIA heroin was all an experiment on population control. It is well established during the secret war in Laos that they brought back heroin with dead bodies of GI's. This happened during the time period of MKULTRA and forced opioid addiction.

This article was written on the issue just 2 days ago which is what had me post this: http://www.robertscottbell.com/government/opioids-are-mind-control-drugs-mkultra-is-alive-and-well-by-jon-rappoport/

What do you all think? How far DID THEY GET with the forced morphine addiction studies for controlling people & creating secret assassins? We all know opioid addiction can cause people to do things they don't want to do. React in ways they choose NOT TO ACT. Nothing else known in the world has this capability.

Is the opioid epidemic related to MKULTRA. 

More importantly, is opioid addiction capable of creating a Manchurian candidate? ",1511721131.0

No new revelations here just random observations)"," Does anyone else feel like the first they snorted an opiate or took an opiate in general was the most blissful beautiful feeling in the world. (The dragon blah blah nothing new but I mean in reference to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/7fh3ta/what_it_feels_like_to_do_heroin/ ) I don't agree that it was ""meh"" I had 0 opiate tolerance.

 I snorted a half a roxy (maybe 10 mg) I was outside in the middle of winter surrounded by snow and I couldn't have felt warmer. It was just indescribable. I was also madly in love simultaneously. Talk about nirvana... these days if I take half a blue I'll feel how clogged my nose is and not much more. 

It must be said that the first time I did heroin was not as good as the first time I got high on an opiate. I remember it was just extremely itchy. I scratched my thighs until they bruised. It felt good. I noticed the fact that h was more intense, it felt different not better. So maybe this is what the OP means? Also once I did h I could never go back to oxy because I wouldn't feel it. (Unless it was one of those green oxy 80s but it still felt ruined from the h)

Also wtf is hillbilly heroin I came across this term on some Netflix show. Is that like oxy?

I live in a condo so there are parking spots for everyone so I don‚Äôt have my own driveway or anything. I decide to get well in my car before going inside. Start breaking it down to prep and out of no where two plain clothed cops walk right up to my window and knock. Scared the living shit out of me btw. I had probably about .25 or so broke down and soon as I heard the knock on my window I dropped it in the back floorboard of my car as slick as I could. Immediate feeling that he saw what I did. He motioned for me to open the door. So I just rolled down my widow and asked what was the problem. He said someone called about a suspicious person sitting in a car just chilling. I said that I live here and I‚Äôm just smoking a cigarette since I don‚Äôt smoke inside my home. He then asked for my id and I flexed my rights at that point. Told him I don‚Äôt have to give my id if I haven‚Äôt broke the law. He of course gets pissed and said for me to sit tight while he runs my plates. He came back and first thing he said was ‚Äúwhere are the drugs‚Äù I at that point gave off the vibe that I was pissed off for him asking me that since I don‚Äôt have any drugs what so ever! (Clearly a lie lol) he said he could smell pot and I told him I‚Äôm a medical marijuana card holder and I‚Äôm legally aloud to burn trees for medical reasons. He again asked me for my id and I refused. I then asked if I was free to go and he said he wasn‚Äôt ready to let me go. So I then asked for his badge number and for him to call his supervisor since I felt like I was being profiled. At that point he said I was free to go and to try not to act suspicious while smoking a cig sitting in my car. I laughed and walked away. Soon as he left I came back out to my car and luckily the dose I was prepping was still sitting on the surface I was breaking it down on and didn‚Äôt spill.

so after paying attention to the opiate scene i knew i would have a couple of options open to me to try and find a good pill hookup. although i do want to get into dnms im just not ready yet and getting a package right now is my biggest prob. 

after a few misses on cl finally got someone to work with me. sweet. turns out they happen to be very close by which is too ironic for this giant spread out city. i mean we are very close.



so i put in a small order to test out the product and of course the guy is on time to our mellow meet up and come through. has since come through one more time. very very happy with a solid new connect. was stressing that i was going to hit wd before i found a new source but that wasnt the case.


as much as he is a very good source i will continue to develop and nurture our relationship i will also be on the lookout for two to three backup sources. you never ever know when you might need the backup so its always good to have.



anyway here i am felling very very good properly medicated and opiated at just a mere 10mgs of hydrocodone but my tolerance is very low for now and i would like to try and keep it that way for a little while at least!

The flowers bloom in hues that are brighter than the norm, and in the sky the clouds shape into mysterious forms, images I don‚Äôt have names for but somehow recognize. Beams of sun only strengthen my eyes, as I stare straight at the Day time star I wonder how I can ever feel so empty in such a place of happiness, warmth, majesty and love. 

I wonder how it is that the joy that once made my chest swell until it I thought it would burst now makes me feel as though I am dying of thirst. I lay by the pools of my harmony but only feel worse, my wretched remembrance is not what our meadow deserves.

The seeds I planted underneath dry California sod spent so long frozen they were fragile when they thawed (I‚Äôve  never told anyone, but I was sure that they would rot). And while many died, others bloomed, and so my empty plot has been consumed by all the vines I grew when I loved you, and all of the days we woke together in the morning dew, and how just like Eden we ended too soon. 

I guess that‚Äôs why I like to hide behind the cypress trees when you cross my mind, because memories taste like yesterday, and yesterday tastes like sadness, and I want to see our garden as something beautiful, and nothing else.",1511849797.0

It feels good to be back here because I love this sub, it‚Äôs a little bittersweet because coming back here means that I relapsed after a year of clean time. I went to rehab and followed it up with 3 months of outpatient. I was doing great in sobriety, got a girlfriend that I really like and my job is going really well. I got jumped by 2 guys when I was drunk about a month ago (when I say sober I mean from opiates) and had to be rushed to the ER with brain bleeding, had to get stitches in my lip, and the inside of my ear was fractured. I was blind sided by the way, I had no idea who these fucks were and they just walked up and said hey can I ask you a question, and then started swinging. Anyways, I was fed copious amounts of opiates in the ER for about 16-18 hours, mainly dillies via IV and then some oral percs. 
I was prescribed 5 mg of percs without any APAP and have them to my roommate to dish out to me so I wouldn‚Äôt abuse them. He is well aware of my addiction and kept me on a very tight schedule. Unfortunately it was not enough and I was in really severe pain, mainly from my ear because they stuck a wick in it to help heal the fractures and it contributed to my headaches being much more severe. Anyways, when it came time to get my refill I didn‚Äôt inform anyone and took them myself because I was still in a lot of pain and wanted to be in control of my own dose as one 5 mg percs every 4-6 hours wasn‚Äôt cutting it. Well as I‚Äôm sure you can guess I went through 30 in 3 days. When that ran out I was still in pain and managed to find my old dealer‚Äôs number and have been doing black on and off since then. It‚Äôs caused a lot of problems in my relationship, with friends, family, etc. but I‚Äôm back in the cycle again. Withdrawals aren‚Äôt terrible but they still suck...I get sober for a couple days use for a couple days. I am thinking about trying Kratom, I have been reading up on it but I‚Äôm curious to hear any of your thoughts? Anything you guys would like to share on relapse, kratom, drug addiction, etc would be cool. Haha not gonna lie the first time using black was amazing, that warm feeling taking over my body and the instant relief. But every time after that was a mixture of bliss and guilt, I am no longer in really bad pain and I don‚Äôt really need opiates; at least not strong ones, which is why I am also interested in kratom.

I was also prescribed clonodine and hydroxyzine which I don't really get much from either. I was noticing a slight decrease in withdrawal symptoms if I took 1,200 + mg of gabapentin at a time. The dosage the doctor prescribed didn't do shit for me. So yesterday I ran out of gabapentin and only took 600mg at around 9:00 am. Today I wake up and feel like absolute shit!!!! I was sweating, hot/cold flashes, whole body aches, depression and restless legs you name it. I should also note that I took 10 g's of Kratom Saturday night, and 20g's of Kratom yesterday too so I could just be flushing that out of my system and experiencing withdrawals from that. I also have been taking loperamide every other day in 10mg doses. 

. I know I'm a fucking idiot for putting all this bullshit in my body and I'm flat out just tired of it all! I'm sick of all the meds. Take this to combat the withdrawal symptoms of that. In the past month its been nothing but IV heroin, Suboxone, Kratom, loperamide, gabapentin, clonodine, hydroxyzine and weed. I feel like my brain is totally fucked. Oh and I forget to mention I found a 1mg Xanax at the gas station today. Knew what it was the moment I saw it and grabbed that shit in a hurry. Of course I took it, passed out for about 4 hours.

. I guess I got way off topic. Anyways, the question I'm asking is if anyone has experience coming off gabapentin after a short use but at high doses ie less than a month at around 1,200 mg or more a day??? Thanks to anyone who has any insight.",1511840805.0

The current regime just isn't cutting it- obviously. I could be due for a UA at that appointment (I'm tested every 3 months and it's been 3 months), so I'm thinking of freezing my urine tomorrow while I would still show positive for my meds.

I gagged on the smoke because I was dope sick as fuck.  (does anyone else find cigarettes awful and make you gag when dope sick even though you're a heavy smoker?)

I pissed out of my ass three times within 45 minutes of being awake.  It was AWFUL.  I finished my shit and sat back down.  Within about 10 minutes I had to fart and felt another wave of poo ready to be extruded out of my anus.  I finished that shit and sat back down... and then, once again, attempted to smoke a cigarette.  I didn't gag this time but after about three puffs I felt ANOTHER wave of diarrhea.  ""Where is all this SHIT COMING FROM?!"" I asked myself.

I took one final huge liquid sludgy dump and felt a wave of nausea come over me.  I puked in the bathtub and nearly passed out because of how hard I was heaving.  Snot filled my nose and my tear ducts went into overdrive.  My stomach was real sour and whatever acidic shit I puked up made my throat close up and I had trouble breathing for a few seconds.

I cleaned off in the shower and got out of the bathroom feeling EXHAUSTED and DRAINED beyond belief.  I just crashed into my chair and sat there like a zombie.  Muddled, cloudy thoughts filled my head due to being dope-sick and my eyes found a point on the wall to just stare at lazily, feeling chills on my shoulders and arms causing my arm hair to raise on their ends with chill-bumps all over my forearms.

I finally broke down and pawned some computer equipment I own since I had access to a car this morning and RACED to my dope man.  After what felt like an eternity, due to being so ill, I arrived at my dope man's crib and scored a blue.

I crushed that bitch up in a Wendy's straw (shit straws, BTW, don't recommend them unless you want the straw to split and your dope to fly out like baby powder everywhere when you are crushing the pill within the straw.  It's like a conspiracy.  Alot of restaurants have started using straws with less plastic in them or something, like they know folks are using them to snort roxies!) and snorted that bitch as carefully as I could and then snorted a half-full bottle cap of water to get the drain going and to make sure there was not any powder going to fall out of my nose and shit.

I immediately went from being dope-sick to high but even though I was now ""well"" the sheer stress on my body from being sick was still somewhat apparent for a while.  Relief is not a big enough word when that oxycodone hit my brain that was crying out for the chemical imbalance to be corrected.

What an amazing feeling, getting that fix when I was hopelessly in withdrawal and shitting on myself and puking.

The sweats and chill-bumps went away immediately and my mood went from depressed to exuberant within a matter of seconds as the oxycodone binding to my opiate receptors caused my body to correct itself.

I was finally well.

Until tomorrow.",1511826886.0

Agents intercepted a shipment of Cyclopropyl fentanyl, a derivative of fentanyl, according to a criminal complaint.

Portland police said the package was linked to an overdose death that happened in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

According to police, 80 people have died in accidental overdoses from synthetic opioids such as fentanyl since 2014. The deaths are increasing, the Oregon State Medical Examiner's Office said.

Joseph Caruso, 33, was arrested outside his Lake Oswego apartment on Nov. 21 for the sale and distribution of illegal narcotics, according to court records. He is now in federal custody.

A U.S. postal inspector at the Portland International Airport air cargo facility got suspicious after picking up a yellow padded envelope marked ‚ÄúKnitting Needle.‚Äù The international package had been shipped from Shanghai.

The inspector said the contents felt like powder, not a knitting needle.

Investigators took the suspicious package to the Portland Police Bureau‚Äôs Drug and Vice Division for safe testing using a ventilated hood. Inside two heat-sealed Mylar bags, investigators said they found a plastic baggie filled with off-white powder weighing 27 grams.

The Oregon State Police lab identified the powder as Cyclopropyl fentanyl, according to the criminal complaint.

‚ÄúCyclopropyl fentanyl is a very powerful opioid that is ingested in microgram dosages and has been the cause of several recent overdose deaths in Portland, Oregon metropolitan area,‚Äù wrote Special Agent Guy Gino of U.S. Homeland Security in a criminal complaint filed in federal court.

The U.S. Attorney‚Äôs Office in Oregon authorized investigators to replace the potent opioid with a harmless powder, then send the package on to the intended recipient in Lake Oswego.

Investigators said they watched Caruso remove the package from his mailbox. Then, he was placed under arrest.

Caruso has a previous conviction for possession of heroin in August of 2014.

According to court documents, Caruso was identified in a Chinese Ministry Public Security investigation after Chinese officials busted a drug organization sending fentanyl to the United States.

‚ÄúCaruso‚Äôs [phone] number was associated to a package containing 50g Fentanyl addressed to another individual in the Portland, Oregon on November 1, 2016,‚Äù wrote Special Agent Gino.

A search of Caruso‚Äôs Lake Oswego address found six imports mailed to Joe Caruso between October 2016 and November 2017, explained investigators. The international packages had descriptions listed on the manifest such as ‚ÄúSAMPLES OF COSMETICS,‚Äù ‚ÄúDOLL‚Äù and ‚ÄúPRESENT,‚Äù said Special Agent Gino.

Investigators said two similar packages sent to a recipient in Michigan tested positive for Furanylfentanyl, an analogue of fentanyl.

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid similar to morphine, but is at least 100 times more potent.

She mentioned that she only takes Tramadol, and that she has a shit ton of 10mg Perc's that she can't take because they upset her stomach.

‚ÄúSundays are always the same. All of the other days of the week are a little bit different but not Sunday. Sundays are always the same,‚Äù said Blake to Kenny. Kenny had just started running food at the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida.

‚ÄúThat sounds like the beginning of a story,‚Äù said Kenny.

Blake doesn‚Äôt respond to that. He starts asking personal questions instead. Not really out of interest but more out of boredom. ‚ÄúDo you guys ever think about suicide?‚Äù

There is a collective murmur. Most people say they had thought about it. You can‚Äôt work at a restaurant without wanting to kill yourself at least once or twice a month.

‚ÄúWhy are you so quiet today, Greg?‚Äù Kenny was talking to me. My name is actually Grant, not Greg. I don‚Äôt correct him. I never do.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel good yet‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean I haven‚Äôt had my coffee yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre drinking coffee right now‚Ä¶‚Äù

 I don‚Äôt really know how to tell him that my ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù is a bit different than most people‚Äôs. I say nothing and walk away.

I walk around with a look of purpose for a bit until my relief was to show up. About 30 minutes or so. If you walk like you are going somewhere most people assume you are working when you work in a restaurant. The only problem here is that this is the worst Sunday brunch buffet in Jacksonville, Florida. Most employees only know how to do the same thing every week for their share of setting up.

I usually decorate the desserts. When I‚Äôve had my coffee, it is done to where it doesn‚Äôt look too bad. It‚Äôs never anything to write home about, but nothing at this buffet ever is. If I haven‚Äôt had my coffee they look really bad and the whole process makes me want to throw up. Sometimes I do.

I go to the bathroom to hide for a little while and maybe throw up a few times. It‚Äôs really gross in there like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned in a month or so and it smells really bad. I end up throwing up a few times. Sundays are always the same.
I check my call history. It had been 42 minutes since we talked. He had said 30 minutes. This is almost 50 percent more time than anticipated. Twelve more minutes than planned. Twelve lifetimes. Twelve 24-year-failed lifetimes. Twelve whole fucking minutes.

My phone rings. It‚Äôs a guy who goes by ‚ÄòSolo.‚Äô He is a big fat black guy who I‚Äôve never seen eat but I‚Äôd seen smoke a ton of crack. He also likes the same kind of coffee that I did.

I was never really sure how he stayed so big doing what he did. Normally what I would do when I saw Solo (which was at least once per day) is I would pretend to be a talk show host and pretended that he was my guest. I asked him all sorts of questions about his day to day life and enjoyed hearing his perspective on things like political issues and controversies that were going on at the moment. Sometimes he offered some incredibly insightful answers to my questions. Other times not so much. I enjoyed my imaginary talk show. I think Solo did too.

His life both fascinated and disgusted me. One time we were having our coffee in his kitchen, the set for our show during that session. There were maggots in his sink and an old pot with uneaten ramen noodles, or that is what Solo said it was. Flies were buzzing around the sink judging us as we indulged. Despite our stage for the day I enjoyed myself. I think Solo did too.

I don‚Äôt have time to ask Solo any questions today. I leave his car wondering what he might do throughout the day. He probably drinks coffee all day.

I walk back in through the beaten backdoor of the restaurant. I immediately go toward the bathroom. Locked. Holy fuck get out of there right now I will seriously fucking hurt you. Another whole minute goes by. Another lifetime. The door swings open. I go inside.

I close the door to my sanctuary. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so nice in here,‚Äù I think to myself. There‚Äôs no real bad odor or anything. Just a good ol‚Äô sanctuary.

I quickly start my ritual. No good day ever starts without a ritual. A flame. Some bubbles. A mouthwatering vinegar smell. A crimson cloud of liquid rushes out and flows back in. Bliss.

I walk out toward the dining room. Lee Logan is telling Alex and Blake something about ‚Äúthe circle of life.‚Äù This makes me smile. Alex and Blake look bored and disappointed. I enjoy the moment for them. Briefly, I pause and enjoy that very moment on behalf of every person in the restaurant. Bliss.

The restaurant is slow. Partly because it is rainy and partly because the food is terrible. There isn‚Äôt much to do for servers when it is slow especially when the mean manager isn‚Äôt there. Sunday is the mean manager‚Äôs only designated day off. Sometimes Mean Manager still shows up. She is usually sporting a mean face, albeit dressed a bit more casual on her days off. If she is not there she gets all reviews, food/beverage comps and other various restaurant reports sent to her phone. Mean Manager is a little bit nutty.
I‚Äôm standing by myself thinking about Mean Manager and a few other things about the restaurant. Alex, Blake, Kenny, and one of the high-school food runners are standing around talking about nothing in particular.

I don‚Äôt join the conversation but instead eavesdrop a bit. My thoughts were mostly about the restaurant and I fucking hate this place so eavesdropping seems better.

I get bored of this and decide it is time for more coffee. More relief. I head to the bathroom. Sundays are always the same.

I still have so much coffee. If I enjoy all of it at once it would surely kill me. I fantasize about that for a moment. Maybe after one last relief. One last ritual. It begins again. Vinegar on the stove. Red clouds in the brown sky. Bliss.

I look down at what I have left and smile.  A thought crosses the back of my mind. ‚ÄúI have it good now, but soon I won‚Äôt.‚Äù

And try to wait a couple hours after you‚Äôve gotten going already. Don‚Äôt just open your eyes and take it. Earn it so to speak.

I spent a year in a country with no opiates and I finally arrived back in Australia a few weeks ago. Today I was finally reunited with my best friend. 

I got 3 points of supposedly pure #3 Afghani heroin and nearly jizzed in my pants when the mail arrived. 

I opened the packet up to do some lines but was shocked to find this stuff was sticky as hell, resembling a gum of some sort, so it was impossible to snort  

I wished I had some needles even though I'd never really injected the stuff besides in hospital but I live far from a pharmacy so there was only one way

I wasted 2 points trying to smoke the shit off foil and failed a million times (also shoved a nug up my ass and took some sublingually to no avail)  but finally with my last few spots left, i mastered the art of chasing the dragon and was sent into that bliss I so dearly missed. 

Love, empathy, euphoria, complete contemptness for the entire universe. I have been united with a friend I have yearned for an entire year.

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. 
thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1511926774.0

Tips?,"So this weekend I am trying Buprenorphine. This will be my first opiate use recreationally. I understand that Buprenorphine has different bonding affinities than other opiates, but for someone with no tolerance I should be pretty high. I also understand that this opiate is many more times stronger than morphine. I am going to take like 1-2mg intranasally. I might also add some Vistiril. I am buying an 8mg Suboxone, but after I take the 2mg I'm flushing the rest down the toilet in order to not pursue potential temptations. I am doing this because, I have tried tons of drugs like: LSD, Shrooms, Weed, DPH, Cocaine, DXM, Alcohol, Xanax, etc. I want to try everything in my lifetime, so naturally at least one opiate is on my list. 

I debated this decision for a while. I understand opiates are no game and their power must be treated with respect. As a result, I am surely playing with fire. But I have strong will and don't think I will let this drug take to much of a hold on me. Any tips for doing this safely? I am obviously nervous about this but my mind is made up. I have studied the consequences of opiate use and the neurology behind it for quite some time. I have also read this subreddit for awhile. I feel I am ready if taken responsibly. Any feedback is appreciated. Cheers

Edit: Thanks for the very rapid and supportive comments. I think I will pass on the opiate attempt (for now at least) in exchange for some Molly/MDMA (another I need to add to my resume.) You guys scared me the shit out of me as expected. Sorry if I disappointed people curious about a future update. Also might take people suggestions and wait for a more euphoric opiate such as Oxy's or Hydro's. Gotta make the experience special I guess. Thanks again and I wish you friends the best.

I've just realized that a lot of stuff I snort makes it into my stomach, bypassing my nose because I don't have as much turbinate surface area as normal people.

I don't want to progress to shooting. It's hard to plug when you're stopped up all the time, too. Does anybody have any tips to increase nasal absorption?

I can almost see you shaking your heads and saying ""But, what about the rush? What about the 100% bio-availability? You are really telling us we should stop IVing our dope?"". Well, yes, in fact I am. Allow me to explain:

Even though IV is the most efficient way to use heroin (it ALL goes directly into the bloodstream) your body simply compensates for this, raising your tolerance. So, within less than a week of shooting dope I was already needing to shoot as much or perhaps even more dope to get off as when I was sniffing. Not only that, but for some reason IV heroin lasts significantly less time than snorted. So you actually spend more money when you IV than when you sniff.

So what reason is there to IV? Well, there is a rush. A feeling of intense pleasure (or just plain intensity sometimes) that lasts about a minute after you slam down that plunger. Naturally, this minute of intense pleasure is highly prized and sought after. It is the best minute of a junkie's day. However, in my case at least, I feel like sometimes the rest of the high can be somewhat of a let down afterward because its never as good as the rush and IV is a LOT more fiendish, kinda like smoking Crack vs snorting Cocaine.

Mine was just being absolutely clumsy as fuck. I was in the midst of a couple months long binge and had been just chucking my discarded foil under a cabinet in my bedroom (still lived with them then). This was already clumsy enough, but it never actually got me caught. 

My girlfriend was over so I was sneaking off to the toilet for a smoke every now and then and finished a slice of foil that I was using. Rather than taking it back with me I just dropped it down the back of the bath. As usual my memory for the better of me and I totally forgot until I received a nice little text saying 'Your mother found some foil behind the bath. have you been smoking heroin?'

My answer was of course I did but not in a long time. That was foiled when I got home to find them sitting in the main room with a coffee table full of used foil, so many good time lain over that table. 

My dad knew exactly what it was used for but encouraged me to tell my mum it was a different painkiller (Oxycontin). 

Since then I've moved out and certainly don't leave any foil about when I'm back visiting!

Do most people on this sub Reddit get their Oxycodone from Pain Management or a PCP? I will post my story below that I posted before so you can get a gist of what I am going through.

---""Hey everyone! I recently tried going to a PCP since my relative said that she prescribed him opioids for pain. He has MS and I have a condition called Transverse Myelitis which is rarer and similar to his. She gives him a two month supply which is 150 Oxycodone 10 MG and 150 Hydrocodone 10 MG. I have very bad back and neck pain and I have tried everything except injections which I want to stay away from due to costs mainly ( which I hear is ridiculous ). I go to his doctor and she said she doesn't prescribe Percocet anymore because of the opiod epidemic and she could lose her job. She tried to refer me to Pain Management but I've tried going and it is really expensive. 300$ a visit with insurance. I'm 24 so I'm not sure what to do even if I did go to an appointment since I'm young and everyone is really strict. I have my MRI's and official diagnoses. I did havey neurologist prescribe me 170 10 Mg Percocet every month but it was two years ago ( he shut down his clinic or quit ). I did go a different PCP who was known for not giving narcotics but he still gave me 10 mg OxyContin because he seemed to understand my situation. I have also been to the ER and they don't give narcotics either but the ER doctor still gave it to me and told me to go to Pain Management as well. I have to mention as well I do smoke Marijuana and in Georgia, Marijuana is illegal whether or not you have a medicinal card. I have also been taking Kratom and it is helping a little but I've noticed months of taking it has steadied my tolerance and has even increased it. I don't know what to do next. Does anyone know with the right insurance how much pain management costs would go down? And if it is really my only hope? I've just heard bad stuff on how they're strict and if you fail their drug tests then you're pretty much red flagged by every doctor. I also don't even know if they will dose me based on my pain level since of my age and height (I'm short). Sorry for rambling, but at this point I'm not sure what to do. I can't even keep a job (lost three jobs) because of the pain I'm in and due to the transverse Myelitis I already have to deal with my nonexistent feeling in parts of my body along with my uncontrollable bladder ( which I have to wear a diaper for ) and I have this pain. Does anyone know what should I do? Sorry for rambling, even if no one replies at least I was able to take out my frustrations via text. Anyways thanks to anyone who can help!""",1511888822.0

I know Reddit's pretty USA-centric so figured this advice could help someone over there. There hasn't been a post on the subject here for a few months so this is a refresher if anyone wanted it.

I find it fucking ridiculous that the law would discourage people from phoning in OD's out of fear of arrest. I also think it's a shitty thing to do to leave someone OD'ing because you're scared, but can understand that fear makes you do stupid things. Still, the law should be encouraging legitimate OD calls, especially considering the Opiod crisis in its current state. For that reason I wanted to show readers here this [Link](http://www.ncsl.org/research/civil-and-criminal-justice/drug-overdose-immunity-good-samaritan-laws.aspx) (it's NCSL, which as I understand it, is a pretty trustworthy site) so if one day you find yourself in this situation, you at least know the law. 

As a foreigner, I don't want to try to tell you how your laws work. I just thought this would be helpful, and if it's something that might help a guy in trouble, I thought it was worth sharing.

(he knows I have been before and gave me some time off to withdraw a little over a year ago.) 

He puts pressure on me to work so we can get these jobs done today and I end up going to work. Don't know how I fucking did it but I did and made my 100. But holy shit I was puking so fucking much and my back has been killing me all day. It's a lot like withdrawals. I came home after getting a ride to dboy and laid down but I'm puking every 2 hours about 2 or 3 times and then my back starts hurting like crazy again.  

On top of that my boss won't let me drive the work truck anymore to other jobs for extra money so I fucked myself on that.

Praying that none of you guys get this. It is hell.",1512028859.0

I've got 5 months sober myself, but I would never want to put myself and my opiate addiction on blast in front of tens of thousands of people. I'd rather keep that in my circle of trustworthy folks, considering the internet has proved its depravity often enough.


I just don't get what would make you crave attention like that. Plus in my experience, this type of ex-addict is the militant kind, who will not hesitate to impart unsolicited nuggets of wisdom and generally feels like overcoming heroin addiction makes them a saint among men. I know someone like that and in his self-righteousness and punchable calmness he looks like a bad parody of Buddha.


But then again I've been called a cynic pretty often and I'm probably too negative a person. I am glad for that girl's recovery but I wouldn't act in her way and I don't think it's smart, is what I'm saying.

I've been on methadone since January but a majority of the time since then I IV'd at least 8mg dilaudid a day because I have some chronic pain. My methadone Doctor knows this and is okay with this and has been working with my pain and considering prescribing me something so I don't use, and he's told me since im used to IV he would probably up my methadone (from 40mg) while I started getting used to not IVing and also giving me higher than a normal starting dose and seeing if I can go oral that way. Im 100% okay with that. 

Anyways, in my time IVing I've used quite a few veins. There was one I found about two months ago that had a great blood flow and made the hits feel great and it was so easy to get to. Now, I had a few boils in this vein (I get them a lot, like most of the time ever since I had abscesses last summer. I've made them go away for a couple months but they did come back) the boils have healed, and theres a bit of scar tissue. However most of the time I try to hit this vein I still succeed and get that nice rush of blood into my needle. But sometimes I don't, but Im in the general area where it is. So about two weeks ago I thought I'd try anyway, and I was in. I actually ended up drawing in the blood about halfway through the shot that first time so I knew for sure I was in the vein. I've done it a few times since and I draw no blood, but Im DEFINITELY in the vein. It doesn't feel like a miss, I get the rush I do when im in any other vein, there's no swelling, there's just no reason to think it was a missed shot. This has been done with the d8's and heroin. Has anyone experienced this before? Something like it? Im so confused by it. My assumption is that there's a lot of scar tissue preventing me from drawing blood, because I do bleed afterwards and like I said it feels exactly like a shot that isn't missed and right in the vein. I don't experience this anywhere but in that one spot either.",1512027669.0

How does it affect your experience with opiates? And anything else you can think of feel free to add. 

Also does anyone know where I can find any scientific evidence papers will studies in regards to the combination?
Thank you for your input & help. This would be in regard to either smoking tobacco or vaporizing it in eliquid/juice form.

I don't smoke cigarettes & have never really enjoyed them unless really really stressed out and I have nothing else which is rare but there is one exception where I can tolerate them which is on opiates for some reason. 
Even then I only will smoke a cigarette if I don't have my vaporizer sub ohm pen. It's not a huge box one as it's not practical but it gives nice hits/clouds about the size that a hookah or shisha would but of course much smoother. 

I know from my experience I enjoy my vaporizer pen with menthol e-juice (the only juice I like & only one I can find with natural flavors like Menthol crystals. 

Of course though that propelyn (sp?) glycol & vegetable glycerin (50:50 ratio in my ejuice. 6mg nicotine which is low compared to what a heavy smoker how would you use if they converted to eJuice. Which could be anywhere from 12-20mg.) are not hundred percent natural lol & I wouldn't be surprised that there's negative physical effects but still healthier than a cigarette and still preferred by myself if I had to pick one after a shot of hydromorphone or morphine. 

I do wonder though if it being a CNS stimulant it could maybe sober you up in some aspects. Possibly idk. 
Which is why I'm intrested in studies or any science proving if this is true or not. I do find it takes away some of the downer which in most cases isn't great as you want to maintain your high. But it's also more enjoyable. Alot more than usual. Usually I only have a fraction of the ejuice I have on a regular day aka 10-15 hits. 

Anyway that's my experience what's yours?

I also say I would be interested in anyone who has info regarding science that relates the two substances together (articles, studies, videos, books etc.).

I also hope I didn't misspell heroin.,"Like so many of the greatest stories ever told, this one also begins with a dirty microwave.  The pitiful machine watched me like a terrified child from the corner.  I paced in the dark.  It was not long before I got crazy and stuffed her into a roll around suitcase to collect her ransom from some villains I knew.  The kidnapping was going well, until I got a greedy itch on the way to make the exchange and robbed the Scholtzky‚Äôs in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  It was 50 feet from my front door.  The manager and cashiers knew us by name.  My accomplice was an old, crippled man on crutches, and the suitcase had my all of my personal information on it when we got arrested.  It wasn‚Äôt my best day, but then again it wasn‚Äôt my worst.  Let me tell you what happened.

----------------------------------------------------



I detoxed in the back room of Cheo‚Äôs house.  It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worst.  I swore it was a curse the witch I beat up in California put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn‚Äôt there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.

The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones‚Äô hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebra, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain‚Äôs synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Cheo‚Äôs back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard‚Äôs hinges creaked while his family slept. I got solidified chunks from an ancient can of ensure stuck between my teeth and gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. 

I reeled from the horrors I lived on the streets of California. Cheo‚Äôs wife would talk to me about this or that while she cooked dinner, but it always ended up with her assuring me I was okay.  She promised I would recover. It was like flipping through a book I knew so well, but evil was written where there had been good. Blank pages existed where maps of myself had once been drawn, and termites had turned the remaining pieces of parchment into confetti. 

I held my head in my hands. 

Who was I? What had I done? Something was wrong and worse than ever. I did not cry, but I probably should have. These were the pains of metamorphosis, which I never could feel on the drugs, but when I was sober, the screams of my own mutilated conscience echoed inside of my skull. 

I thought about my father and the things I did to hurt him. I thought about my mother and how she threw herself on the bed and cried when I got arrested at the house. I thought about the failures with my girlfriend and how disgusting I was. I registered for school and moved into the Warren Inn in the city.

My back felt straighter with the prospect of a new life in a new environment.  It was a fresh start.  Sleep was possible.  Pieces of my mind were coming back.  I was clean.  The itchy rash was going away.  Spring semester started, and I had a little girlfriend, so things were looking up.

The girl liked me even though, I had given her a Valentine‚Äôs Day card with another girl‚Äôs name scratched out and hers scribbled beneath it.  It was hand drawn, and I managed to rhyme violet with toilet in the poem I wrote on the inside. 

I told her she was beautiful.  She looked at the scars on my legs in bed.  We ate her birthday dinner at a Mexican restaurant with her family a few days after that, and her grandmother laughed at everything I said. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a very interesting man!‚Äù  Her grandmother said.  

She seemed to think I was good for her granddaughter, but I smoked cigarettes.  I lay on a bare mattress in the dark.  I watched reruns of Roseanne till four every morning.  I wanted to burn my life down and would as soon as I got the chance.  Our relationship ended as soon as I found out that my next-door neighbor could score heroin and cocaine.  

My dad came to visit one weekend in late February, and it was a Saturday night when I told my dad I was going to see the girl.  It would be a good excuse to ask for 20 bucks and give me an opportunity to try scoring at the mall.  When I couldn‚Äôt find anything, I walked back to the Warren Inn to see if my neighbor could help me out.  I had only seen him once, but he seemed like a drug addict.  

He opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn‚Äôt hear me through the wall.

‚ÄúCan you get anything?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you‚Äôre not a cop.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.  That‚Äôs no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad‚Äôs in my room.‚Äù

In ten minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.

I had not shot up heroin since I left California, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs felt like an elephant stepped on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in his garbage can.  He told me to come back in the morning if I wanted more.

My dad took off that next morning like he had planned.  It was not the best visit.  Sure, I was off the streets, but when he showed up he had to take me to buy sheets for my bed.  My clothes, room, hair and life in general were more disheveled than he liked to see.  I spent 20 dollars he gave me on a haircut, but it looked the same when I came back.  He got mad and made me get another one.      

Before he left he hunched over in the wind and counted out 200 dollars for me in the parking lot outside of my building.  He bit his tongue, because it didn‚Äôt look like anything was going to change with me even if he thought I was sober for the moment.  

My life unraveled.  

Within a week something like 300 unopened condoms littered the whole room with heroin cookers, rubber tourniquets, baggies of cotton balls and alcohol swabs from the needle exchange.  Trash littered the floors, and a film of cigarette tar and ashes covered the windows and mirrors.  Feces piled high out of the toilet that had quit working weeks before.  I systematically broke into every car in the parking lot one night and kept the useless loot.  There was one half of a 20-dollar bill, three small bags of dirt weed, several briefcases full of what appeared to be dried out potting soil (if that can even be believed), a broken ironing board, and manila folders full of someone else‚Äôs old resumes, among other things.  It was all on the floor in my room that stunk and stayed dark like me.

The Warren Inn was full of sad people living sad lives who barely survived on food stamps and the crumbs they had left for the month after paying rent with their SSI.  That‚Äôs why the cars had nothing good to steal.  A crazy guy invited me into his room on the second floor of my building and read from a notebook some things he had written.  There were jars of urine and feces in the corner and an eerie desire to get out of there as soon as I could.  

A middle-aged woman with bad skin lived across the hall from me with her boyfriend.  He had a withered hand and a limp.  They got into a fight one day, and she tore off in his van.  He chased her.  I ran into their room and stole a pair of boots, a jacket, a sleeve of generic Chips Ahoy and a sleeve of saltines.  Later that night, I tried to dine and dash at the IHOP but gorged myself on French toast so badly, I couldn‚Äôt run.  The next morning, I shot up a syringe full of cocaine and Tracy‚Äôs blood even after he told me had Hepatitis C.

My life continued to unravel.  

Another man lived in the building next to mine. I supposed he was a man, but there were things about him, like his breath and the texture of his skin, that made me wonder if maybe he wasn‚Äôt a clump of yeast and dough somehow become sentient. His motor skills and the air of his sophistication were on par with most three-year old kids I knew, and his dress only added to it: an old bomber jacket, cowboy boots, ear muffs and a pair of ski goggles to ride the bus. His only teeth stuck out his bottom gums, like two pieces of corn. 

I told him about surviving Katrina. He told me of younger days in a biker gang and presently bulging hernias. Gnarled fingers grew out of his knotted hands like the branches of an old cypress tree, attached to frozen wrists where the bones had fused together. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got rubatide arthritis. Had it for ten years, now.‚Äù His pronunciation of the ailment incited serious questions in my mind. How could someone live with such inconvenience? How did he deal with the pain? How did he have a disease for ten years and not know how it was pronounced?

He got me a spot selling newspapers, because the regular guy was sick.  A van picked us up in the morning and dropped us off at our respective locations.  It seemed to be more about putting a few quarters in the pockets of these decrepit liquor hounds, than it did about actually making money.  The novelty of notably destitute newspaper vendors on the same street corners every morning must have somehow been good for the press.  I just couldn‚Äôt figure out how. 
 
My hands went numb, and everyone who bought a newspaper asked where Ray was.  Some people just asked where he was but didn‚Äôt buy one.  It took over four hours to collect seven singles and 13 dollars more in quarters.  When I did, I abandoned my post and walked to Taco Bell.  A guy tried to sell me a package of stolen razor blade heads at one of the tables but settled to rip me off by a canal on the other side of a chain linked fence.  He wouldn‚Äôt shut up about shooting up in the back of his hands.  I should have known not to trust him.  


Larry moved into my room, and whatever pomp he projected that first night in Tracy‚Äôs apartment had withered with his frame.  Now he stood on his crutches and stared into the bathroom mirror, shooting thick mixtures of cocaine and heroin into his neck.  His once beautifully conditioned and manicured hair had turned into a matted ball of lint exaggerated by his skeletal frame and highlighted by the purple track marks running down his jugular veins.  There were stragglers from up and down the road, who came in and out of my room day and night.  A 24-year-old guy we called Popeye stopped by frequently and bragged about kicking in doors and raping women.

Popeye imagined booty lay on the other side of every window and door he saw, and nights he came around saw me trying to climb up the sides of buildings and into windows impossible to reach.    He jumped over the counter at Schlotzky‚Äôs and took a 20 out of the drawer one day and got away with it.  Popeye called me guero and liked to say I was stepping on his toes.


One night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry‚Äôs coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner.  It had been a hard night for me as I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin.  He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out.  11 pills had turned into four while he slept.  He looked at me.  I said, 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù

I made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll around suitcase.  It still had a laminated card from my grandmother‚Äôs travel agency and my own information from flying on it.

‚ÄúCall Luna!  Tell him to bring a dub!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?  You think he is going to want that nasty, little thing?  You‚Äôve lost it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust call him!  I‚Äôll deal with him when he gets here!‚Äù

Larry called him, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway.  I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches.  It was a number 24, Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front.  My mom had ordered it for me brand new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California.  Larry‚Äôs crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt.  The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out.  The power chord dragged behind.

It had all unraveled.  


As if the bright red racing jacket and microwave in my suitcase and the raggedy old man on crutches didn‚Äôt attract enough attention or make us easy to identify, the whole crew of that Schlotzky‚Äôs knew us by name.  They always let us wait for Luna in the store out of the cold and even gave us free drinks from the soda fountain.

The manager smiled at us and asked us how we were doing and walked back to the drive-up window.  It was not likely that Luna would accept the microwave and not likely that he would give us a ride to hock it for the measly five bucks it would fetch.  I jumped over the counter to hit the cash out button.  The drawer opened, and I took a couple 20-dollar bills.  An employee screamed at me.  

I handed Larry a 20 and ran through the parking lot behind the Warren Inn.  Somehow, I knew to get rid of my red jacket and went to my room from the other side of the building to change my clothes.  The sunglasses, headphones, blue Dickies jacket and backwards Kangol cap were enough of a change that when the cops came into the building to look for me, they asked me if I had seen myself running by in a red jacket.

‚ÄúNo, officer, I haven‚Äôt seen him.‚Äù I tried to walk down the road but it was too cold.

I walked to the other building and knocked on the yeast ball‚Äôs door.  A few days before this I sold him 20 dollars of laundry detergent and watched him put it in his arm while I did the coke he bought.  He knew I ripped him off, but there was nowhere else to go now.  The cops were coming.  I knocked again, but there was no response.

When I finally walked back to the room to meet the cops in the hallway, they smashed my face into the wall and handcuffed me.  They already had Larry in the back of a squad car with his crutches and the 20 that I gave him.  The cops told me they would let me go with a ticket if I could give them back the other 20, but Larry had warrants and was going to jail either way.  As bold as it was to jump over the counter and help myself to the money in the cash box, the cops only charged me petty larceny.

Sitting there in handcuffs, I wasn‚Äôt embarrassed by gawking onlookers or the slowing traffic.  At 19 that was who I was, a criminal junkie, and that is what criminal junkies did.  They got arrested at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning for being embarrassingly inept at crime and the whole world saw it.  The officers talked amongst themselves and said that they wouldn‚Äôt go into the room to look for the other 20 because of the filth and stench.

Larry and I spent three days in jail and went to court on Friday.  I took my charges and told the judge I had only come for school.  It was a mystery to me how I ended up jumping over the counter at a restaurant and taking money out of the register.  He let me go with time served.

I love this sub, I love the support people have here for one another, and the positive reinforcement to beat this demon we‚Äôre all facing. It‚Äôs because of that that I‚Äôm thinking about sharing my story through Instagram posts. I‚Äôm not doing it for notoriety,  I want to do it because I feel like most social media accounts are pretty much bullshit selfies and cliche pictures/posts, so I want to make one of substance, one that will show my progress from addiction to sobriety. I think it will also hold me accountable and not want to let those people that are following my progression down. I mainly want to do it to inspire. I believe I was put through this hell to overcome it and share my story to hopefully help others going thru addiction so that they might overcome it as well. I wanted to share it here first because I love this space where everyone is free of judgement, so let me know if you all think this is a good idea/will follow and help me thru this journey. I know I can get through it and I want to help others as well. Maybe it‚Äôll even shed light on how the world views addicts and addiction as a whole. Love you all and thanks for any advice/comments ... 

I just created it. I‚Äôm going to do it, I think vulnerability and honesty will be refreshing and will motivate me to continue to do it. The more views and follows I get will just be more inspiration so I‚Äôm asking for your upvotes and follows; if this helps even one more person with their struggle then it‚Äôs worth it.

I think it will be cool for people to see what I look like as well. I feel like I‚Äôm not your average user. It‚Äôll just show that addiction has no face.

Now im thinking of waiting a few days to detox the subs out of my system and when the wds kick in again going back to kratom.

I just enjoyed this sub like always and a question popped up: I donÀãt enjoy opiates not the least. Once I took 80mg Oxy for start and 160mg over the course of 18 hours (no tolerance). The only effect was violent vomiting the day after. Foolishly I even tried Heroin to at least know what makes the opiate high so ‚Äûdesirable‚Äú. Before anyone says ‚Äûquit while itÀãs like that‚Äú or wants to give advice on what might work instead: Opiates (like dissociatives) are off my list. Camping next to a toilet for a day is not worth it.

Now to my actual question: If you could choose, would you prefer to be ‚Äûimmune‚Äú to opioids or keep it like itÀãs supposed to be - excluding the analgesic effects, just the ‚Äûrecreational high‚Äú.

Of course this is no judgement in any way, but even if you‚Äòre not using - would you miss to even have the option?

Since I don't have a job, those weeks were usually spent wasting away on the computer although I did work out 3 times a week most of the time. 

I've been to rehab before (never longer than a month tho), seen psychologists, been on every anti-depressant in existence, benzos... the only thing I haven't tried after getting clean is living a normal life: having a job, friends, getting fit, being able to take a girl somewhere other than a junkie-home.

The photos here are shit, I apologize. My phone camera is horrible. They also do not show the proper color, or at least they look quite different in the pics than what they do in person. In person, they are a fairly light blue, not turquoise or teal. As someone who has had these prescribed in the past, they look pretty much like anything I'd ever gotten, color-wise. It's by far the most convincing aspect to my eyes. That said, I do have some questions and was hoping you guys could help me figure this all out.

-The tab has little specks of a deeper blue, and these specks are also present within. Is this normal? I don't recall ever seeing this, but don't honestly remember ever looking.

-One of these tabs does seem to be a little offcenter with regards to the 'M', but I think I remember some imperfections on the imprint with even legit prescriptions. Am I wrong, or do they always have perfect alignment?

Lastly, can anyone tell me if the front side and the back side should be aligned in any particular fashion? For instance, the M on the front isn't always uniform to the back imprint. The top of the M on one side will be under the bar with the 30 on the back on a few, but others are perpendicular. Should these be aligned a certain way or are they randomly printed?

As for effect, they seem to feel like an opiate. They taste kinda bitterand burn slightly but no more than any other I have ever insufflated. They also take a little bit of effort to crush, and are somewhat grainy. Certainly not powdery. I seem to remember the legit ones breaking up much easier than other brands out there. They are not glossy either, but I think that's normal. They weren't stored properly, so I also  kinda expected them to be somewhat rough from the humidity.

Anyway, I really appreciate the responses, and I will delete this post as soon as I get some better idea. If this is not allowed here, any advice would be appreciated as to where I can ask. I am mostly just trying to avoid harm to myself before continuing with using them. Thanks guys!

 For those who've seen it: 

How crazy is that? Do you think us junkies would get downvoted into oblivion? Also, in that society, truth is voted on. Whatever gets the most votes, wins. Do you think if we lived in such a society, that opiates would be illegal?  Like if this had been going for the last 100 years, do you think The War On Drugs would have happened? Or do you think enough people would have upvoted heroin to make it okay?

Edit: I also have zero tolerance. How fast can I expect tolerance to build? If I try to keep it to like just once a week (good luck to me) will my tolerance reset each time?

2nd edit: When I was asking how much is too much I meant to ask is there any way I can tell if I'm getting close to an OD or anything? I'm just sniffing it

For benzos and oxy, it‚Äôs hard to source where I am and I have avoided buying at all cost as I know I would kill my self in months.

I have always had a fascination with heroin and have been incredibly drawn to it. For that reason, I have never taken it. No offence to anyone on this sub, I just know myself so have distanced myself.

I think about it all the time, and how if I lost my friends and family I think I would just buy a ton and see what happened. I dream about being terminally in and taking heroin constantly.

Just kind of trying to get my thoughts out here. I've been a pretty heavy H user for the past year, recently got clean about two months ago. My boyfriend and I used last night because we had a long week and thought we'd treat ourselves. We're sniffers, and knew our tolerance was pretty much gone so we were going to be careful... right.

Admittedly, I did my line and thought to myself, hmm that seemed a bit too big. But I was ready to feel that sweet relief again, so I pushed that worry to the back of my mind as that warm feeling started to creep up my body. My boyfriend tells me he's going to the bathroom. I'm feeling good, I lay down on the bed and close my eyes...

Next thing I know, he's standing over me, as I'm laying on the floor, dragging me to my feet and sobbing, telling me to get up. I groggily follow him to the bathroom and he sets me in the bathtub and starts running cold water on me. Through shakey breaths he tells me I overdosed. I start crying, telling him I don't want to die as reality starts to set in. 

Apparently I passed out while he was in the bathroom. He came back and saw me curled up in bed, and thought I was just relaxing after a long day at work. He told me to wake up and tried to play with my hair. No response. He said my name a little louder. Still no response. He noticed then I was breathing very lightly, in shallow wheezes. My boyfriend thankfully knew something was wrong instantly, and carried me to the kitchen and laid me on the floor. He said he tried getting me to wake up by lightly slapping my face and rubbing my sternum. At that point he realized I wasn't breathing at all and my lips were turning blue. He then began giving me mouth to mouth breathing and checking my pupils. 

The scariest part he said was looking at my eyes and seeing how lifeless they looked. Like he could literally see the light fading from them. At the point, he decided to administer chest compressions while dialing 911. Thankfully, before he hit dial, I finally gasped myself into consciousness, which is all that I remember.

I am rattled by what happened. I legitimately do not remember anything that happened after I laid down. And to think that I wouldn't be here right now had he taken just a little longer in the bathroom has truly frightened me. I didn't have a point to this story, I just needed to talk it out.

A year later, massive infection. All over my back, rib cage and even in my bones. Rods got taken out because they were no longer needed and had to clear out the infection anyway, so they just took em out. 

Fast forward to today, I have frequent nerve pain in my hips, constant moderate discomfort unless I‚Äôm sitting up against something, my back hurts after so much as vacuuming, doing dishes (leaning over the sink) or walking for more than about 10 minutes straight. The other day I was walking to my car from a football game and I almost couldn‚Äôt make it. Sitting in the bleachers during the game was incredibly uncomfortable.

Some days are pretty terrible. I try stretching and doing what I can but nothing really helps for more than an hour or two. I‚Äôm a law student right now so I can‚Äôt fuck around with pain like this and I don‚Äôt want to let it get in the way of my future.

I‚Äôve got an appointment coming up with the surgeon who performed the original operation. I want to get a script for something stronger than Tylenol or whatever. I‚Äôve got limited knowledge of opiates but, my mother, 2 time cancer survivor, has given me some of her stuff from time to time to help my pain and it has worked.

I'm so damn sick of it all now but I truly feel stuck in this cycle. I've got some subutex but it feels damn near impossible to take that instead of going to score some h. I just can't imagine how I'm going to survive the day without having my smoke. The boredom is just unbearable. H makes me immune to boredom. ",1512063687.0

SHARE your experience!,"I'm early into my recovery from 5 years of heroin addiction. About a month ago, my life came utterly crashing down. I won't really go into specifics but you can read my post history if you would like to know more. I basically lost my job, apartment, girlfriend, and car in the span of a week due to my heroin use. My father also just died while holding my hand, fighting for his life, just the other night. I'm going through a lot right now, but despite my shitty life I'm still about 3 weeks clean from heroin. 

.      .My doctor and family both have been pressuring me to receive a vivitrol injection as soon as possible. I am very hesitant not because I want to use, but because of the whole idea of blocking my opiate receptors. It would only make sense that the blocking mechanism would also effect things like runners/weightlifting highs, the euphoric effects that music brings me, and maybe even food and sex. Call me crazy, but I feel like Vivitrol would effect my overall mood and I would lose sense of who I really am. I'm a paranoid person and I feel as if Vivitrol would cause me to blame every negative emotion I'll have on the shot. How would I ever be able to accurately identify if I'm experiencing side effects from vivitrol, or is it PAWs that's causing these potential issues? Can anyone relate? Am I making sense here? Please, anyone would like to share their experience with vivitrol please do so. Thank you.",1512230392.0

forgot my old login and was more of a lurker anyhow soooo new acct, old junkie me haha :'D

I'm gonna go to mexico over nye after an ibogaine treatment (2nd round). Unforunately while the first one helped, I relapsed after 2 mo. clean. It changed a lot of my attitude tho, I'm not on MMT anymore and actually have goals n shit.

 Now, I have friends over the pond in Mexico where I will go after xmas to smooth over the transition into normal life. A biggie that lead me to using here is that I have almost no clean friends leftt and Germany is socially as cold as the weather, although we have a geat welfare system. To get back into life, I planned a trip to mexico until spring.

My friends there use, no H tho. H is a no-go, Pills & coke are fine tho. I know its hypocrytical but for me its good, as I need them to score anything worthwile without getting into situations I dont wanna be in. I have a job lined up over there even tho Im not even done with Uni over here. And good friends that would rather slap my WDing ass instead of getting me H

Now I know I will use there. Altho its gonna be pharms, coke and weed, for me I will use as it is vacation. I just want to get rid of the addiction. Maybe that mindset will change but atm thats how I see it. Ill take Ibo in 2 weeks, doing H until then, so Ill be physically set once I arrive. Some Questions:

How is it with the legality of pharms thereP My friends say its noi prob to get benzos & tramadol. I really wanna try Opana at least once in my life. Is it smarter to go the DNM route or will it be avavible via local sources?

Same w/ oxy, Dillies, hydrocodone. I really DONT wanna do H there, as thats my DOC. I know, its all the same, but honestly for me and esp my friends there its a red line I dont wanna cross. I love that country and would hate to fuck it up for me addiction-wise. Also, I dont wanna deal w alll the shady drug war shit. Im from Germany, our dope is shit but its all rather safe. I prefer not to get shot or mugged in an alleyway.

Rigs: I can get rly good coke there, my friends dont shoot and I prefer them not seeing me shoot up, but I wanna try that good yay IV if Im there at least once. Are they avavible?

If not -  can so. maybe send me a care package w/ rigs n supply stuff ( NO DOPE), I'll paypal you the cost.

Is Narcan avavible? Esp w the strong pillls and seeing that some of our crew are opiate naive and some arnt, I wanna be prepared. I wont turn guys on that shit, not my style, but I know that if some of us do oxy, Opana or god forbid H, some will folllow. I dont want any dead friends. If not -  same as above - can so. from the US maybe help me out?

Also, general Mexico thread: What should I look out for, any tips (not just drug related)? Any stories?

So my question is based on what i used to take, how much morphine and codeine should i plug ? Also when i take codeine i do a cold water extraction so there is a lot of water, it's going to be hard to plug right ? maybe i should plug the morphine and then just drink the codeine after i plugged the morphine ? but then i'm scared that it might not kick in at the same time .. And also a last question, do i have to plug it all at once ? because when i crush my morphine pills it seems pretty hard for me to get all the powder in only 1 syringe, i'm almost 100% sure that there will still be some powder left in it so i wonder if i can do 2 plugs or something in order to get all the powder in my ass and not waste some",1512219372.0

I‚Äôm between chips for the time being and reading and writing posts keeps me sane. For whatever help or interest it may be here‚Äôs the methadone chapter of my life story haha:

I was pretty naive when I started. I could find pills whenever I wanted back then but my habit had outgrown my budget and I just wanted to be free of the daily grind of hunting and waiting for my feel-good shit. At the peak of my using then I was taking 8-10 hydros a day (this was before oxy became so available).  

I was 26 then and in hindsight could have detoxed myself rather easily but the allure of a daily dose for $11 + gas money was too seductive. I had never even tried it before I walked into the clinic with a using friend of mine for my intake and first dose. I‚Äôll never forget the look on my buddy‚Äôs face after about 5 minutes down the road from the clinic we turned to each other with the biggest holy shit-eating grins! We felt like we had hit the lottery. 

Twenty minutes later I‚Äôm at home on the couch nodding harder than I had ever experienced until that time. The clinic had started me off at 25 mg and in hindsight it was probably too high for someone with a hydrocodone addiction and it took a couple of weeks messing with my dose before I hit that sweet spot of high enough not to be almost completely sedated for most of my waking hours. I kinda wanted to be lucid enough to hold down a job lol. It was the most powerful opiate I had ever used and it would be 15 years before I would ever touch a pain pill again.

Fast forward through ten years of methadone maintenance treatment which included a move in the middle to the Pacific Northwest and transferring to a new clinic and all that entails and then back home still on the done. 

Through all those years I had got my dose as high as 60 mg per day down to 6 mg per day. At the end, I was back around where I started at 30 mg but not taking all of my take-home doses. I was getting a two weeks supply by this time and trading the leftovers for weed or cash as needed. I got called in for a bottle check and lost my take-home privileges. I had no drivers license at that time and no way of making the 70 mile round trip for daily doses. I found a local doctor prescribing suboxone and stayed on that for another four years but that‚Äôs another chapter and I‚Äôve rambled on enough.

I guess the whole point of the story is that I will feed my addiction however I can based on whatever circumstances I‚Äôm faced with and at the same time strive daily to have as much of a normal life as possible. Balancing those two often conflicting things has been the struggle of my life so far and its daily, high or not high.

I'm not an opioid user, but I used to lurk here after dating one a while back. I've run into a dilemma, and y'all seemed like the people to ask.

I have endometriosis, which causes very severe monthly pain. I managed to book a long flight for a bad pain day this month. Seeing as the flight is in a week and my pain has only recently gotten much worse, I don't have many options as far as getting doctor appointments, medications (birth control would work but takes too long to kick in), etc. 

I have Percocet lying around from a dental surgery, and I'm considering taking it during the flight. The only time I've taken it before, I got horrifically nauseated. So, here are my questions:

1) Is there any reason this might be a bad idea?

2) Is there any way I can avoid or mitigate the nausea? I'll probably be vomiting from the endo anyway. Don't want to make it worse. 

3) Someone told me opioids don't take away pain; they just make you not care about it. Is that true? I don't think I want to take the amount of any drug it would take to make me not care about this pain. It can get to a 9/10--nearly delirious, lying on the floor unable to move, etc. 

Edit: Also, how much would be appropriate for an opioid-naive person with severe pain who wants to be as mentally alert as possible?",1512195436.0

First time ever using.,"For some reason I thought my mom wasn't going to let the doctor give me a perscription for pain meds to use after he yanked all my wisdom teeth out so I looked around and found a friend that had a perscription.

Well I buy 8 off him and he says, ""there 5mg each and 3 puts me on my ass so don't take more than that at once I don't want you getting hurt""

I'd already read some posts about hydros and how people said they didn't really feel great until 20-25mg with no tolerance.

Well I have never taken hydros, except one time where I mixed 1 pill with a xan and a lot of coke but that was a long tome ago and a story for another time. What I'm trying to say is I had no tolerance going into this.

Since he said they were 5mg and most people don't feel really good until 20-25mg I'll take 6 so I'm at 30mg and will feel more than what they're describing as an awesome experience. A lot of people were saying they throw up around these doses or get naesuas but that's never really been a problem for me and I've never thrown up on any drug save alcohol.

Well I took them at 10:34pm, roughly 12 hours till I had to be at the oral surgeon for my wisdom teeth removal. By 4 am I was still unable to sleep, I was slightly itchy all over but as the night wore on the itching was more in my legs. I felt like I had no worries and a really cozy feeling like I was sitting right in front of a fireplace. 

9 am rolls around and I try getting out of bed only to find it's difficult to walk. Odd. Hydro high only lasts like 4-6 hours I thought I read. Look in the mirror and pupils are non existent. Don't get me wrong I've had this effect before when I first found fent ( i only did fent a handful of times)

Get so nervous that the annestesia will boost the effects of the hydros and make me not wake up, pray before they put me under. Wake up everything's good. I still had 2 hydros left so I checked them literally an hour ago and read the engraved writing on it. They are white oval shaped and read Watson, and below that ""853"" look it up and realize they are 10mg pills and that I took double what I thought I was taking. Oof. 

Just wanted to know if it was common for a dose like that with no tolerance to last that long? I was fucked up for nearly 12 hours only other drugs that have done me like that are psychedelics.

When I was in the worst of my addiction there would be up to 7 pills in that baggie every day. Sure, I had dealers and bought from them. But my mom also had a prescription for the drug I was buying, and figured by doing this I wouldn't feel like I had to seek out drugs and I could use and get high, without getting myself into any bad situations. This started when I came to her telling her I was an addict and wanted help. 

Of course her plan was to slowly wean me down, which we did. Unsuccessfully. Every time she got her script I seemed to have an excuse as to why I needed extra and I'd milk that excuse for so long. Until she didn't have enough to give me my normal amount every day either. So she'd buy some and we'd have a talk and I'd agree to try again. This lasted a few months, until I finally decided to go on methadone. When I did I felt so much better, I didn't need to use anymore. I could get through the day without it. Except all my chronic pain came back, and so did the unbearable migraines three times a week at least. And imagine a doctor would prescribe any sort of pain meds? (Even though none of my doctor's know in an addict). So, I started asking her for a few every day and I was spiralling down that hole. So one day when she came to drop off my smokes with the little baggie attached to the side she told me she understood im in pain and offered to give me one a day, without fail. No more, no less. And that I didn't have to take it, but if I needed it it would at least be there and asked me if that would make me feel a bit better and not feel like I always had to be finding my next pills to make sure that when pain did start I had something. It was turning it into a sure thing. I agreed. Sometimes I have to take more than one, like when I had to have a few teeth pulled or when I had my d&c after my miscarriage and sometimes on just a really bad day pain wise, and she'll agree but she keeps tabs and if I ask top many days in a row she asks my what's bothering me, and sometimes I don't even realize something is until she asks, and once we talk about it it's easy to go back to just having the one. There have been times that I've been able to go weeks without taking the pills she drops off and I don't have any temptation to, and I love when that happens. There are other times (like now and recently) that I don't touch that pill because I've been using heroin. 

Obviously I'll always have my bad days, and I know I'll relapse and I know that's normal. But the fact that she listens when no doctor really does means a lot. My family doctor wants to give me a script, she believes in in as much pain as I am as often as I claim to be, but she says in too young (im almost 21, she's been saying this since I started complaining of pain at 16). The doctor at the methadone clinic also recently brought up that he's considering giving me a script for pain as well, and it feels nice to finally be getting somewhere. I can't wait until the day that I don't have to rely on my mom to drop off a pill for me every day. But I love her so much for doing so, and for understanding that my addiction didn't form only from mental pain, but from physical too and that I can't get better until the pain im in is under control. I love her so much and thank her every day for supporting me.

Tinychat can be VERY shitty about the mobile app so if you can connect with a computer, that is the best option.
firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in our very own tinychat room which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.


tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.
if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.


rules:
pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy.
no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.


no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane.


no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)

This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* 

I originally joined r/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.

For 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. 

During my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. 

The 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. 

However, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I & my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) 

So, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.

I was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:

* Day 1: 50mgs
* Day 2: 40mgs
* Day 3: 35mgs
* Day 4: 25mgs
* Day 5: 0mgs

I consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean & sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.

With that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:

1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office
2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet
3. Declined my usual refill & declined a muscle relaxant as well
4. informed all my Doctors of the change

I am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again.",1512184530.0

I planned on grabbing at lunch time, but since I had to get a paper check I would have to wait until after work. Again, not a big deal, in not sick yet. So I go to the ATM after work at 5 to deposit the check. I deposit it, and go to take out  $400, to cover what I owe my dealer and get more for the weekend. Processing....processing.....processing....INSUFFICIENT FUNDS!!!! No. Fucking. Way! I just deposited almost $2k into my account, WHAT THE FUCK. I look at my balance, which says -$195, and I now realize that a paper check takes 1 business day too clear. As it's Friday, so that means fucking Monday!!! I called customer service which can't do shit for me. The lady tells me I should go to a teller to cash it in person.  It's after 5, and I already deposited the check so I obviously can't do that now, bitch. Fuck my boss, fuck bank of America!!!!!! God damnit why!?!?!?",1512168893.0

Let me know what you guys think, you will identify with it 10x more than your average reader.","Ok, a quick background on this. Before I started shooting roxies and Opanas and dope, I was one of the highest rated creepypasta authors in the site's all time index, and I was the head of the Monolith forum there before derpbutt purchased the site from WhoWasPhone.

I had written plenty of horror stories. Creature features, ghost tales, you name it. However, when I finally went to treatment for my addiction, I hadn't written any fiction in two years. I stopped caring about fiction even though I was a published author on Amazon. My excuse at first was ""The drugs make me creative,"" but eventually, I didn't create. I just got high and nodded on my couch.

I'll be celebrating a year clean on January 9th, 2018. I wrote the first story of this series, Anhedonius, freehand in a notebook when I was detoxing off dope and afraid of all the meetings and hanging out with fellow junkies in rehab. I finished it about a month later, and then I wrote a sequel.

This is a horror fiction story about a heroin junkie who gets kidnapped by a pharmaceutical company that basically invents a cure for cancer and any other serious disease, but they have to murder and farm people with altered Mu receptors in their brains to manufacture it. It's very long, but quite horrific, and I poured my heart and soul into it, because for all intents and purposes, the main character is basically the way I was when I was on drugs.

Instead of reading Anhedonius, you can listen to if if you want on The Mad Catter's Twisted Teatime podcast, which is on iTunes, Soundcloud, Stitcher, and all that shit. Or you can just go to the youtube link.

[www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius](www.creepypasta.com/anhedonius) (to read) or

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bYj_FEpzo&t=104s) (to listen)

The sequel, Liquid Blue, should be uploaded on creepypasta within 24 hours, as I just finished it about two hours ago. No podcast for this one yet, but if you're from San Francisco or you're familiar with the Tenderloin, it's right up your ""alley.""

Liquid Blue:

If you'd like to purchase one of my novels off Amazon from the old days or donate to me, I'll be publishing a new short story compilation in January, but all I really ask is for reviews for my writing on creepypasta/NoSleep/Pseudopod or any other medium that my writing has been accepted in.

Thank you for reading, and remember, there is a way out, and you can care again about things that fell by the wayside as this shit slowly takes over your life. You can get it back, because I did. It wasn't easy, but I did it, and you can too.

Stay warm, guys, and I hope you enjoy this. I worked very hard on it.

My boss couldn't pay me until like 5 hours after I got off and I was starting to get sick. I only had enough cash for half of my normal pickup and it would not have been nearly close to enough to keep me well until after work the following day and my dboy shuts down shop before I would be getting paid tonight. I decided it would be my monthly ask for a front and get shot down day. So I ask and even tell him a can pay him tonight outside of business hours... And he says yes! Oh my god.  I was stoked and already about to meet him. Then 5 minutes go by and he texts and says he doesn't want to front anymore.  WTF? I called him and was like what the hell you just said you would and we proceed to go back and forth and he finally says, after me guaranteeing that I could pay him tonight,  ""Aight, we gon do this then champ"" I said ""hell yeah we are!

I'm still pretty new to reddit (long time lurker) and I've had a question that's been on my mind for the past year - though extensive searching online hasn't yielded much. 
Does anyone have any personal experience with diprenorphine (bupe's super high affinity cousin)? The wiki article and a few other research articles online state that is has a very small amount of agonist activity. I'm mostly interested in its potential use as a mild buzz for anyone being forced into Vivitrol/naltrexone since it's one of the few opioids that can easily out-bind naltrexone (and nobody tests for it).

How the fuck do I achieve that? I've tried therapy. I've tried medication. I've tried detox. I've overdosed. My mindset never changed. I want to feel good forever. The harsh truth is you need to experience that pain to grow. I wish I could tell you what drove me to get clean. It wasn't about living because I OD'd and had to be revived and I kept using. 

The thing is, I didn't use to hurt other's. My using brought on pain to the people around me that I don't want to feel. My reason for using was an escape from having to experience those negative emotions. I never thought I'd change my mind.

One day I woke up and just didn't want to shoot heroin anymore. I wasn't afraid of the sickness anymore. My biggest fear at that time was losing myself. 

I don't even remember my clean date because we're constantly changing and for me to mark a change isn't my vibe. I just know every Tuesday is another week I didn't use. So maybe that is counting. 

I'm rambling now but the main point I was trying to make is that I just woke up one day and didn't want to use. The sight of heroin turns my stomach. I used to get boners looking at prepped  needles but now it makes me sick.

As Sara gets out to pay some random tells her he thinks a couple guys ODed in their car on the other side of the parking lot. Visibly freaked out Sara asks if I'd check it out and of course I agree not wanting anyone to die if it can be helped.

Both guys have their chins on their chests and certainly look dead so I knock on the window and when that gets no response I open the drivers unlocked door. It was at this time I got a good look at the driver and realized I know the guy, I also realized they were both breathing but just to make sure they were alright I tried to wake them. My friend (Guy) slept through me yelling his name and shaking him, his passenger woke up but when I warned him of the probable police appearance in the near future he just mumbled something at me and closed his eyes again. That's when someone walks up to me from the store and asks if I had a light so we walk to my car so I can get him one.

After handing this guy a lighter he asks if I get high, since we've never met I say no and even though I said no dude starts offering me Xanax and ice then asks if he can come with Sara and I. Of course I say no and that's when Sara comes back to the car and tells us the girls working there had called the cops cuz dude wouldn't leave and was freaking them put. I run to Guy's car, slap the fuck out of him and when he finally wakes up I warn him about the cops, run back to Sara's car and got the fuck out of there.

My phone goes off and I see it's Guy thanking me for the wake up call, apparently he was up for way to long and crashed waiting for the creepy guy who was only supposed to be grabbing smokes but just never came back out. I told him about his creepy friend getting the cops called and he said soon as dide got high he started acting weird, then I made him promise to take a nap and here I am!

There's not really a point to this story but I would like to acknowledge the way everyone assumed these two guys ODed when the only thing to suggest they use heroin is they're sleeping in their car and in their early twenties.

ive gone through withdrawals the 10th time this year (or more) and have no money to continue. im one week off opiates again, after a 1 week relapse-- and smoking just costs so much.

i have .1g left, and no money for a month after that-- aswell as a needle exchange programme that offers injection advice as harm reduction.

i want my final hit to be a warning to myself. i feel i need to put myself in that corner instead of being one foot in and one foot out-- either binging or withdrawing.

is it that much more cost effective to use the needle, and how destructive is it to your veins with clean apparatus and DNM dope?

i know smoking is the fastest way for a drug to reach the brain, so with no tolerance am i simply better off smoking a giant blob at once? since the needle rush, i assume, is because tolerance prevents any rush from smoking as it would take several hits-- while at baseline tolerance could smoking a BIG hit achieve the same results?",1512353111.0

Well, after a few texts to a handful of posters I found this one dude who wanted to talk on the phone first before texting.

I felt comfortable meeting up with the dude after speaking to him and was confident he was legit.  

Got to the meeting spot, waited 10 mins, talked to the dude for a bit, made the transaction and boom!!...success!  

Just picked up a g just in case it was bunk, fake or I got ripped off. It's good stuff and pleased with how it all went down. Got lucky on my first time and glad nothing sketchy went down.

This isn't a gratuitous shot, it's a small sampling of the crazy amount of prescriptions that I still have left over.  This is about a third of everything tucked away for the last 2 years.

Here in the US, a lot of chronic pain patients set aside a portion of their scripts each month. This is mainly because they know that when they go in for their next monthly visit to get scripts, there is a good chance the doctor will not prescribe what they need.  The DEA looks for ANYTHING that will give them cause to suspend a pain specialist's license.  

In Florida, the DEA now sets up stings like this regularly.  Recently, an undercover agent got prescribed 2 week's worth of hydrocodone (qty 30 - 5/325) for claiming and ACTING like they hurt their back.  The doctor knew that he shouldn't write for a full month and wanted to see if the the guy came back with an MRI as requested.  The next day, the DEA raided the place.  It wasn't a cash-only ""pain clinic"" but a general practitioner who had been in business for over 30 years.

Since the DEA is waging war on doctors now, many patients are choosing to stash a portion from what may be their last script.  There is even a small but growing delivery industry in cities like Miami and Tampa, catering to older people who have had their meds taken away or cut back.  It's not unheard of for many senior citizens to actually procure heroin through these delivery services, as hydro and oxy are both now ~$1 per mg.  It is sickening to me; people who take advantage of other people and the government that forces their hand are creating businesses that feed on someone's medical need.

7haytr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7haytr/relapse_complete/,28,https://redd.it/7haytr,Diflubrotrimazolam,Relapse complete :/,"This was the scariest one yet for me. I was doing well. I wasn't crushing it, but I was doing well. 10 months on kratom... even had wife and son both gets scripted pain meds for surgeries in that time and I was so proud of myself for not only not touching them but for not even giving a shit that they were in the house.


Been trading someone a good portion of my over-prescribed Xanax (I don't need 3mg a day doc, you already have me on 1.5mg of klonopin and I have mild anxiety at best) with a friend for their gabapentin and suboxone strips. Figured might as well diversify my comfort med stash where the gaba is concerned, and the subs for traveling without worrying about bringing kratom (which works, for those of you on kratom but not against suboxone - I replace 15-20g a day with 1mg and I'm good. Nice thing too is subs don't interact with kratom the way they do with full agonists. I've woken up, dosed 4g, then remembered I won't be home until midnight, dosed 1mg of sub like 40 minutes later - no problem).



Anyway, friend calls up wanting more xanax. I pretty much always have more to give, so I ask for subs... no subs... no gabas.... some time goes by with no text activity and then..


""I can get you blk""


I'm on the west coast so I knew exactly what that was. I said yes. Out of nowhere suddenly I'm driving to go trade my xanax for fucking black tar heroin. I wasn't having cravings or anything, it's like the offer caught me off guard and the addict in me quickly muffled the ""what are you doing you fuckhead"" voice before it could help me. 


That was one week ago. Smoked maybe a point or two every day. Still used kratom in front of my wife. Yesterday while my wife was out with our kid was the first real alone time I had instead of having to sneak quick smokes in, and I found myself putting a humongous chunk - like half of what was left of the g I got, onto the foil, and I didn't stop until it was all fucking gone. I was finally *high* high. And I couldn't believe how much I was and to smoke and handle it. Was at least 3 points. I tossed the tiny bit that was left in the garbage and went off to do house cleaning. Didn't puke didn't nod just feeling amazing. The act of throwing the rest away actually helped have a good high and not worry about how much more I'll do, but I was far from proud of myself. 


I feel fine today. Tar is gone, back on kratom, but I obviously am still fucking addicted which was a huge bummer to realize. 10 months on this kratom shit too and I've been unable to lower my intake to any significant degree, and now am back to more like 20-25g a day. No breaks for the holidays - everything will either be working or spending time with family; no time to lie on bed feeling like shit but at least recovering. Then it'll be back to the normal grind. No end in sight, I'm gonna be drinking this sludge three times a day for the foreseeable future.",1512322523.0

(Also need advice),"IÔ∏è bought a 40 sack from my plug the other day and the shit was full of so much cut it wouldn‚Äôt even trail down the foil and when I tried to break it up into smaller pieces, it gummed up like sand.

And ya know what?

She‚Äôs actually trying to make up for it...

Cut me a deal on black and oxy the last two times IÔ∏è picked up and threw me some free BHO, so I‚Äôve been high as a kite all damn weekend. IÔ∏è had started to lose hope for pretty much everyone IÔ∏è knew in this game but it feels good to know my plug will actually try to make things right.

Question: should IÔ∏è hang out with my drug dealer? We‚Äôve known each other about six months and have tried to hang before but it never worked out, and IÔ∏è feel like this could be the perfect opportunity to form a friendship and get better deals or something. Thoughts?

Happy nods and stay safe, y‚Äôall! :~)

TL;DR: my plug is actually trying to make up for selling me a shitty batch instead of blowing me off! Should IÔ∏è hang out with my dealer or is this too close for comfort?",1512321732.0

My problem is: Although everybody seems to rave about this opiate, it doesnt seem to work for me. I am now on nearly 20mg (orally and nasally) and still in pain and not high at all. 
before getting the hydromorphone prescription I took about 0.5g of decent quality h or about 1g of opium a day to be able to get through the day. is my tolerance too high for the hydromorphone now? why do the pills hardly work? ",1512321017.0
