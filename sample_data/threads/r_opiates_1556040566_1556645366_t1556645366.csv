Their thin lips crimped in chemical smiles, while a few orange caps litter the pavement at their feet. Further down, a potbellied man is wiping his feet on a sweatshirt which he simultaneously holds by the sleeve. Another writhes in his sleeping bag, a giant larva in its fetid cocoon.

However, this is the worst it's been taking around 450mg (give or take) daily- yes, I know really bad. 100% oxycodone in pill form- snorting only.

My plan is to do it cold turkey (as that's how I've always done it and it's the only way I can do it- especially with a full-time corporate job, I know myself and need to be honest). Should I have any concerns or worries by going through the process with a little Xanax and Clonidine as needed? My plan was to use the two together in minimal amounts for 24-36 hours or so until I can transition to subs for a few days. I totally understand the concern and view of individuals against subs but given my job and current situation, I can't be incapacitated for too many days. I've never had an issue with subs and getting off of them. 

Essentially my plan is to use Xanax and Clonidine until I'm safe to take subs and then sub for 3-4 days and then take Xanax as needed to subside any withdrawal symptoms without subs. 

Am I good to go with this plan? Should I have any concerns that could potentially hospitalize me such as a seizure? (zero history of seizures but the idea always scares me for some reason when thinking of getting off oxycodone). Any other recommendations?

I normally get my blues for $35 each so I was excited to try these. My normal dose is 4 blues snorted, 3-4 times a week. I have a very high tolerance. 
 
Xtampza capsules contain tiny wax beads. Each bead is its own time release mechanism. 

There is very little information online on how to tamper with the time release to make it IR. My guess is they haven’t been on the market long enough for us pill heads to crack the code. 

Here is what I tried: 

I opened 5 capsules into about 3 ounces of concentrated lime/lemon/grapefruit juice. I let the powder (tiny waxy beads) sit in the liquid for about 10 minutes. I then placed it into the microwave for 55 seconds, just enough time to bring it to a boil, then immediately placed it into the freezer. Once cooled down, the wax beads clumped together and floated at the surface. Kind of like when a hydrophobic liquid is placed in water, like olive oil in water. I let it sit in the freezer for 10 minutes, then placed it on the counter at RT for another 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Down the hatch. 

After 25 minutes I begin to feel the effects of oral Oxycodone. Def not placebo. 

I’ll try and update you guys in the comments as the night goes on. 

Anyone have any experience with this time release mechanism? If this goes well I will be purchasing more since this new plug has thousands of these stashed and they are way cheaper than blues. 

Side note: these contain 27 mg OXYCODONE, opposed to 30 mg Oxycodone HCL found in common pills. The 27 mg is metabolized into the equivalent 30 mg Oxycodone HCL. 

I would love ANY information on these!!! Thank you bropiates and happy nods!!!!",1556585959.0

So I'm prescribed Oxy 20mg x 4 per day for a month for a plethora of injuries, mainly from falling close to 20 feet and lived, thankfully, but also from various sports injuries from high school as well as played D1 sport in college.  Although, after that fall from 20 feet or so, and waking up in the ICU of the hospital with a cathrader in my dick was unpleasant, but a story for another time. 

I go through the hell each month of picking up my script, drop it off at the pharmacy, pick up, go home, no problem.  I start to put my pills in my weekly counter, so I don't short myself and it helps keep me on track...but I notice my bottle is wayyyy too fucking light/empty feeling. So I count all the pills out...sure as shit, I'm 60 fucking pills short! I start freaking the fuck out, first, because there is no way in hell a pharmacist is going to believe this, let alone my doctor's office.  So I immediately get back in my vehicle and head straight to the pharmacy, because no fucking way am I letting 60 pills of oxy 20mg slide. Not. A. Fucking. Chance.  I tell the tech what happened, she is cool as shit with me, non-judgemental (wish there were more like her)...she's like okay, let's figure out if we are off on our count ect....so about 10 minutes later, she comes back and is like our count was off, and the pharmacist is going to start filling the rest of your missing pills..I take a deep breath for the first time in what seemed close to a hour.  

The pharmacy tech can tell I'm rattled and is being cool as shit with me....I live in a good suburban town, have a high end job, and am legit about my prescriptions in that I don't sell, I don't take more than I have to, and I don't fill early or any of that other bullshit I'm sure pharmacist and doctor's office have to deal with on the regular.  Anyway, I see a new pharmacist walk behind the counter (shift change maybe?), and two minutes later this different pharmacist calls out my name...I approach the counter, and she begins to lay into me about the missing pills, and how it's not their fault (keep in mind, they just counted 10 mins ago, and the computer count vs. the manual count was OFF 60 pills...the SAME fucking amount I'm missing. Not only is she berating me, but she is doing so in front of other customers and all the staff, who anyone within hearing distance could hear what medication I was on and my name, which, again, is bullshit and embarrassing. I look over at the other pharmacist and tech standing there with my newly filled prescription bottle in hand and my old prescription bottle, which I brought back in with me to show them they fucked up in the other hand.  So I'm confused as hell what is going on...one pharmacist filled it, and the other pharmacist is like bullshit, you're not getting it without a new script from your doctor to account for the missing pills. 

So I'm straight pissed now, because I have to go back and try to explain this to my doctor's office now? yeah fucking right, except that is my only choice, so I grab my original script bottle this is shorted and I drive back to my Doctor's office, explain to them what the hell happened, they are confused as I am...it looks like for sure I'm not getting a new script....my doctor calls the pharmacy, talks to the one pharmacist who was willing to fill my script the first time around, pharmacist explains that their count is in fact off by the same number pills I'm missing....Doctor is getting pissed because he can tell this is no way my fault and I shouldn't be punished for half of my months script gone missing because of whatever bullshit is going on in the pharmacy, but at the same time has to cover his own ass with this bullshit crackdown on pain meds. Thankfully, he writes me a new script, the nurses make a copy of it, detail all the bullshit in my chart, and as I'm getting ready to go, the doctor tells me next month we may need to look at lowering my script because the MME's are too high...even though this is what I have been on for a while and it is what he prescribed me to take...so I'm like fuckkkk. 

Take it back to the pharmacy, the cool pharmacist takes care of it...while I'm waiting, the one pharmacy tech that was cool and helpful at the start of this whole thing, apologizes for the bullshit earlier and that pharmacist that stepped in and told me to fuck off was way out of line, given that everyone realizes I'm short the exact amount of pills that they have extra of.  I pick up my missing pills from the pharmacy and head home where I'm writing this now.  I'm sorry for the length of this post, but had to get it off my chest, because I felt completely fucking helpless, knowing how even though it's clear the pharmacy fucked up the count...it's still not in my favor. I feel thankful and lucky my Doctor/nurses and the one pharmacy tech and Pharmacist were cool as shit about it, especially because they all could tell I wasn't trying to pull one over on them...but fuckkkkk that pharmacist who stepped in out of no where to stop things from going forward without this type of bullshit and fuckkkkk everybody who judges people for taking opiates with their holier than thou bullshit attitudes. Wait till you're in pain and let me know how that Ibuprofen/Motrin combo works for ya. Bottom line, I don't care if you take opiates because they are prescribed to you by a doctor, or if you take them because you like them and help you function throughout the day....quite, frankly, good for you, if that's what you want to do, hell ya. But this whole crackdown on opiates is really fucking hurting people and making people like myself feel so damn helpless and embarrassed because we take them. If you read this far, I appreciate it.

So I’ve been told that when you get narcaned it immediately puts you into withdrawal . I’ve experienced this myself  (worse thing ever btw) 

So my question if you narcaned yourself would you immediately get most of the dope out of your system ??  And would this speed up the withdrawal time line ? I did experience it but I used right away to feel better so I’m not sure if the sweating and vomiting is just the shock at first and then the opiate receptors bond w the chemicals again ? Or if they separate and you’re completely in withdrawal mode ...


 anyone have any experience with this ? Maybe got narcaned and stopped using if so did you feel like it was shorter or was it the same ? Also was the effects after the narcan the worse part of the withdrawal?

So as of tomorrow I'll be 3 weeks clean. I should feel great, but I don't. All the anxiety & depression and body pain that made me use in the first place is back and worse than before. Every time I wake up I have a sense of impending doom and freak out wondering if my mom and dog are still alive and okay, and going to sleep takes hours from the pain and insomnia. I got my insurance together and seen a new doctor a few days ago hoping to get my xanax prescription back cause anxiety has always been an issue for me and xanax is the one thing I never abused (I just don't like it in that way I'd rather take the dose prescribed (0.5mg or 0.25mg most of the time) and be anxiety free when I go out rather than take more and get hungry and black out). It took 2 years of going to the psychiatrist for me to even get the xanax, tried everything else but nothing helped and by the time I got xanax I already had to drop out of highschool from the panic attacks. So I see the doctor and he orders a blood test, ask if I've ever done any drugs (of course not, never, what are droogs?) and I start explaining my prescriptions I had before which was alprazolam, cymbalta, & hydroxyzine. He interrupts me and says ""I won't give you alprazolam, it's addictive and a tranquilizer. Let's try zoloft""...WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN I TRIED THAT SHIT ALREADY AND IT DIDN'T DO SHIT BUT MAKE MY COCK STOP WORKING. Then this is the kicker, I was diagnosed with scoliosis when I was younger. The scoliosis is fucking with my sciatic nerve and is what is causing a good protion if my pain. I tell him and he says ""touch your toes"" so I touch my toes, and he looks at my back and says ""who told you you have scoliosis? You don't have it"" Like what the actual fuck tell that TO MY FUCKING XRAY OF THE CURVATURE IN MY LOWER BACK. Terrible doctor, he dismissed every problem I had. So once again, the doctors that think they're helping us by not giving us the medicine we need are pushing us to seek alternatives. I lost my insurance and literally had HUNDREDS of xanax left cause I rarely took em, and when I ran out no withdrawals or anything cause I never let myself get hooked. I need to get a job so I can't take xanax or opioids which I have my mom holding onto both of for me, luckily I came up on real bars and I only take an 1/8th of one for anxiety so I got a couple scripts worth for after I get a job. I decided I needed something in the meantime cause I cant live with that anxiety that's being exacerbated by PAWS, so I looked up where In my town there's kratom. Went to a smoke shop but they closed an hour earlier than google said, so I went to my smoke shop I used to always go to and they had some for WAAAYYYY cheaper. So yesterday I began using kratom, took around 4 mg first time expecting an opioid high, but first time it felt more like a benadryl and weed high. Got super hungry, and after munching out I felt great. No anxiety, no pain, actually happy for a change and optimistic about the future. Felt like I could actually get work done, where beforehand a shower felt like a chore and I love my hot showers. Took some again today cause I have alot of work to do, and it felt more like an opioid high taken on an empty stomach this time. & as I was typing this I got a call back for a job :) shits looking up.",1556570392.0

I live on west coast recently my Mexican connects phone went of and I had to start going to a new guy luckily it was another mex his stuff is better but cost 70$ more for a quarter. I’ve been going to him for a month now. I almost always buy 7 at a time. The last two times I had to get 6 and this time 5 due to bank issues. The dude I talk to on the phone isn’t the guy I meet. I owed him 60$ I had that with me. I get in the car he ask 6 or 7 I say 5 and I have 60 I owe u he throws me this bag and I get out and get in my car and look at it. For some reason it seems a lot shorter than what I was getting even a week ago. I don’t have a scale but my buddy does next time I pick up I’ll scale it out. The last time I did it was on the money. Maybe I’m tripping but it seemed weird I had an extra 20$ I knew I should have said 6 he doesn’t even count the money or do the math on how much each g is.

Sooo...pretty much free dope, it’s a dial away, fairly close, and I make money on top of it...how am I just supposed to stop this ? I know, I know some will say “you have it made, most of us have to hustle to get our fix.” But this lifestyle isn’t allowing me to progress as a person and I simply don’t want to live like this anymore...I have no real friends anymore, no job, no gf, no life. So where do u start? If I quit, my brother will be badgering me every day for his fix...should I just leave? Take the bus/plane somewhere and stay elsewhere for a bit ? I have some money saved . Do I simply block my dealer and everyone involved in that lifestyle? From my point of view, I got a pretty good gig going on here, but enough is enough ya know?

I am in pain management... and I know my Dr. won’t fill early... and I have told him briefly without trying to make to big of a deal out it, that my meds aren’t working well for me because I have disabled children I don’t get enough sleep or get to rest my body as much as I should.... I never ask him directly to up my meds but I have had the most severe Lupus flare I have ever had this month, which landed me in the ER because I was scared because exposure to sun made my face become extremely inflamed and blistery all over, even with sunscreen on, it was horrific and painful and wasn’t going away, instead it was getting much worse. I did not ask for any pain meds at all and wasn’t given any either because I always disclose my pain contract... I was given a very high dose of prednisone (a very strong steroid for inflammation) which has awful side effects. When I go this month I am going to talk to my doctor about adding something stronger during the times I have these flares. Not only do I have Lupus, but I have Fibromyalgia, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Osteoarthritis in every space in my lower spine (the mid and upper spine have yet to be checked), herniated discs, severe sciatica, neuropathy, bursitis in both hips, carpal tunnel, bony cysts on my right wrist and heels of my feet, IBS, varicose veins behind my knees that after standing for any length of time are extremely painful... and more. Not sure what to ask him to do... maybe for 10 or so pills of something stronger in addition to the 10mg, 4 a day Oxy I get and have been on for years and really, that dose no longer works for me. The history behind my dosage... prior to pain management my original Dr. that discovered my Lupus put me on regular opiate scripts... started on hydro, then Percocet, then worked my way up over time to 30mg Oxy, which I requested to go back down to 20mg because I felt it was too much at the time (like an idiot lol)... but at 20mg 4 times a day, I had the flexibility to take half of one when I needed to and a whole one when I needed to and if I was having a really bad pain day, I could take one and a half. My doctor was aware of how I was dosing out my meds and felt this was a good way for me to manage my pain and it worked. I was also on 30mg MS Contin 2x a day. Then she left the practice due to health problems of her own and the man who I saw instead dropped me straight down to 5mg Oxy, 3 times a day, along with the MS Contin but down to 15mg.... I was in shock, sitting silently in tears. Then the next month after seeing me hysterically crying he put me on 10 mgs 2x a day and 15mg MS Contin 2x  a day. He explained that the DEA was watching doctors closely and he couldn’t prescribe more, that I would need pain management but every referral he put through was denied by my insurance. Later, I was told by my insurance company that it was because his office was sending zero information along with the requests which is why it kept getting denied... so I spoke at length to the assistant that handled the referrals and told her why the denials were happening to which she replied “well I wasn’t in the room with him (during my appt) so I didn’t know to include all of this on the referral”.... like WTF!!! I was miserable (that word feels like an understatement), then I was finally referred to pain management (and with the list of my issues and diagnoses) after about a year and a half of suffering with next to no pain relief, I finally got an appt. I barely made it, truthfully. Barely. (If not for my kids who need me and I love more than my own life,  I would have felt there was no reason to live at all). Before pain management, I had some old meds I had saved over the years that I would take when I was really desperate but it was never enough or consistent and I had to save those for the really SEVERE days. Once at pain management, the Dr. took away the MS Contin altogether and put me on 10 mg Oxy 4x s day (instead of 2) as well as Gabapentin. It doesn’t give me the relief I need to live a semi-active life. I’ve only been there for four months now. Next week will be my 5th appt. When I take 2 (10s) at a time, I feel like a person again, I still have pain, but I can do so much more and it’s so much better for my children and my family. Sometimes it takes 3 (10s) for that to work. The last two weeks with this awful and incredibly painful Lupus flare I have barely been able to get out of bed. I hate to feel so helpless and like many of you, I am so afraid to ask for the Dr. to give me what I know works for fear of being labeled a drug seeker and losing the meds I do get. Then I would have no good days and that is no way to live. I want to feel comfortable asking for the meds/dosing that I know works well for me... I want to ask without fear... but we all know that’s impossible. I’m going to do it though. Not directly. But I’m going to ask him to please make sure I’m covered during the times my flares get out of control because I can’t live like this. I’m not sure exactly how I’m going to go about it... but I will figure it out. I need to be able to care for my kids in the way they deserve, even with my limping around the house, believe me, I do take care of them very well, but it is so excruciatingly painful that by the time it is my time to rest and go to bed I’m writhing in pain and can’t sleep... just to barely get any sleep and start the cycle all over again. I take extra meds when I shouldn’t because then I’ll run out early... but I have no choice. I would rather have two or so good weeks than four miserable ones. So I save just enough so that I don’t go through severe W/D because that would likely put me in the hospital. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I am a caregiver for two of my children through a state program where they get hundreds of hours each and I get paid so they can live in home and not in a facility since caring for them I had to stop working. I gave up my dream, my career, working in creative at a major motion picture studio in marketing. I finally broke down and found someone I trust to hire to help me care for them so this program can pay so many hours a week for each child to this other caregiver to take some of the pressure off of me. I finally found someone I trust and just had her added officially as a provider for them. I’m a hands on Mama and I love my kids more than my own life so I don’t get to take care of my health as much as I should. This is what this opioid epidemic has done to people like me. I have never been a depressed or anxiety ridden person, but now I’m a mess. I just want to feel my age, and not feel like an 80 year old woman trying to live a 40 year olds life (I’m in my early 40s). I have four kids total, one is 25, I had him at 17 and my other children are 15 (the oldest child and 4 the youngest). All three are disabled. 2 with autism (both require 24 hr protective supervision) the youngest one has an auto inflammatory disease that is so painful and causes high fevers and he is sick more than half the month. I’m in a fucking nightmare. And I have to be afraid to ask my Dr. for help. It’s just crazy. Sorry for the long post, I just had to get this off my chest I guess. I didn’t intend to go into all this but it just came out. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. ❤️ (I think I will post this in r/chronicpain too).",1556509132.0

So, what has kratom done for you? How have you used it, what do you like and dislike about it? What does it feel like to you? Any suggestions or tips for a first time user?

Given basically everything via a google search is anecdotal evidence and stories, I was hoping to gather some info related to firsthand experiences from you all.

I genuinely want off. I can’t explain the cycle I’m sure you can relate it’s like I tell myself to dose so I don’t wanna KMS and need to be calm around my family as not to traumatize anyone. 

I took my last dose at like 3am and just now took another dose I didn’t plan to take until 1am Tuesday. I fuxksd up. I saw something and freaked out and was being loud and violent and my baby was crying and I took my whole dose without thinking and then went and took another 30$ worth of another drug I couldn’t afford to use until a special occasion so I feel like I huge pos. The dr says I’m dependant if I get physically sick without. I worry it’s worse that without the opiate I cannot even tolerate to myself and cannot cobtirl myself and hurt those I love most. I am high now watching a movie but I know it’s going to wear off in like 2.5 hour and I do worry about my thoughts 

Anyone wanna chat or anything? There’s an addiction and withdrawal place in town that’s only open tomorrow morn and it’s freee so I’m thinking maybe I bust down a morphine or take some oc and smoke the rest of my hash and try and sleep and wake up to cofeee and weed and feed my family and off I go to meet my maker 

Fml, 10 years ago I went through this and am technically on pharmaceutical that I try and get off always and I worry this will just fuck my life even more. Hence my will. You all know how I’m feelin tho I’m peaking of just under my threshold dose or like just over my get well dose and have some nice weed to get into now. Fuck these pills

I didn't have any sort of prescription or doctor's note or anything stating or implying that these subs were rightfully mine. 1 of them also remained amognst my possessions as I was released the following morning. None of the 5 officers on scene mentioned the subs to me in any capacity at all.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was arrested a few months back, and the cops didn't do or say anything about the three 8 mg suboxone stips that I had on me, still in their packaging. This was in the sourthern U.S. Basically the scenario was that me and a buddy were parked somewhere and the cops rolled up on us and we got caught with ice, dope, ice pipe, and syringes/spoons/cottons etc. After the preliminary search, but before the deep dive began, the officer pulled me aside and asked me if there was anything in particular amongst my belongings that I wanted to come clean about before they were searched, and that if I was hones that it would go a lont ways towards helping me out legally. This was after a few things had been found in the center console and the sides of the doors, but beyond that the vehicle hadn't yet been searched. We'd also been handcuffed and sat down at this point.

&#x200B;

Anyhow, I opted to go ahead and not say shit and just let what come may. They ended up finding 3 8 mg suboxone strips in my wallet which was in my backpack in the front passenger seat where I was sitting. It was very clearly my wallet, and had my ID in it and was on the side that I was sitting in. My friend was being very combative and a dick and I was being the opposite which went a long way towards helping me. Because of this he ended up catching a possession charge and I only got a paraphinalia and was let go the next morning without even needing to post any sort of bail or anything. I originally thought this was why I wasn't charged or even questioned about the suboxone, but upon thinking more about it, there were around 5 cops on scene by the end of all of this, and the one that I saw with my wallet and all of its contents spread on top of the vehicle was not the original officer that pulled us over and everything, so I don't think my friend's negative attitude and my positive one had anything to do with that particular officer's handling of stuff, since he arrived on scene later. Also, the officer did tell me explicitly that the reason I was getting a paraphanalia charge was because the vehicle was not mine, and that the only actual drugs were found amongst his belongings while only spoons, cottons, and used needles were found on my side. BUT, the subs that were clearly in my wallet goes against this completely. He did however state, after I admitted to hiding the paraphanalia, that he only charged me with paraphanalia which is a misdemeanor when he could've charged me with tampering with evidence, which is a felony. This was supposedly in response to my admission of hiding shit, as well as me just generally being chill and respectful while my friend was cussing and talking shit to the officers and being condescending back at them.

&#x200B;

Finally, 1 of the 3 sub strips was still in my belongings upon being released from jail the next morning. My wallet, and everything in it had been placed in big freezer bag type thing and the suboxone package was just sitting there clear as day amongst my credit cards and IDs and stuff. The other two were placed in evidence I imagine. So does anyone have any speculation as to why I wasn't charged with having these subs? Even if it was because of my cooperative nature, I would thinkt hat the officer would mention them to me, especially considering I specifically lied to him and failed to reveal that they were in my possession when he gave me the opportunity to do so prior to beginning the search. Any ideas or anyone been in similar situation? Thanks guys

&#x200B;

since my then 18 year old self got addicted to Heroin almost 5 years ago, my Life has become a nightmare full of tinfoil, needles, enemys and false friends. Did alot of stuff I shouldn't do to feed this expensive habit. Had a clean beautiful Flat full of Life and Art. Alot of Friends came over and we party.

&#x200B;

Now my Flat looks like a dumpster. I'm trying to get help but because my physical dependance is pretty high I wanna get Substitution from a Doc. I met mine last Thursday but since my insurance is private because of my Dad, I had to tell him about my problem. This was a big shock and also a big relief for me and him. I hope the insurance will take over the costs because if not I'm doomed to roam the streets of the Trainstation.

&#x200B;

If I piss someone off because I exist, I'm sorry, just needed to tell someone..

After accepting the risks involved, I took 25mg and had a great first experience. It made me feel extremely numb and extremely euphoric/happy for about 2 hours before I fell asleep. It was awesome.

2nd and third times, I took 35 and 40mg, respectively. Just itching and sedation were all I got. 

Up to this point, all these were done at night at my house. I would take them and then about an hour later smoke a bowl and go lay on top of my bed. 

The next time, I tried 15mg and a joint right before a country music show, and it was lit AF. 40mg later that night didn't do shit except knock my ass out.

Next week, I did a total of 55mg. 40 and then another 15 an hour later. Just felt fucked up, that was it. 

Two weeks later, I did 20mg at my buddy's house and smoked a bowl. Fucking awesome!

A day later, did 35mg. Same as when I did 55. 

To be careful, I'm spacing all these out. Last night, after a week of abstaining, I did 25mg and it was extremely close to my first experience with the stuff.

Risk of addiction aside, am I on to something here? I seem to get more high with smaller amounts. Or is it that I just can't recognize being higher than at that level because I'm still new to it all?

Update: I took 30mg and 4 hits of weed this time; that seems to be the perfect amount for me to get high. I'll cut down on my use and give it the respect it deserves.",1556474459.0

Than I started morphine, and same thing, for a year I used it once a week and it was amazing

But unfortunately I had a really bad time in my life at some point and started using morphine daily, obviously my tolerance went up and I started getting addicted, I've been addicted to it for a year now,  and the high isn't even close to what I used to feel during the 3 years I took opiates once a week

I'd really like to feel this amazing feeling again, but once your tolerance went up, it's impossible to feel this again right ? I think 7 months ago I couldn't take any opiates for an entire months, I used kratom instead, and when I used morphine again after this one month without it, it gave me a high similar to the one I had back in the days

Do you guys think if I try again to stop opiates for one or two months there is a chance I could have this feeling again when I restart using ? I wish I could just go back to using once a week like before, but it's really hard to resist",1556463176.0

I guess I just want to know what peoples experience has been with this and whether you all think it would be a bad idea to tell them to limit the suboxone, since I worry that will only delay more withdrawal symtoms after the short stint of the use of bupe, another opiate with a long half life.

Which is extremely frustrating because in the past they were giving people mouth swabs that were showing up negative for everyone....when it first happened, they made me feel like shit and cut my script to two weeks, and I had to find out they had weak tests through every other patient. They didn't even have the decency to say sorry and tell me what happened. 

Also, about a year after I went there....my DR randomly started flipping that I had benzos in my system, even though he knows I was prescribed them for many years....and I had been testing positive since day 1. Well turns out he told one of his Oxy patients its fine if he takes Klonopin (I literally take 1mg a day). When this happened he tried saying I take little peices of meds and spit throw the rest out and screamed ""You either find another suboxone DR or you have to goto rehab!"" Well anyways I stopped taking the klonopin that following month and my blood pressure went through the roof, ....all for them to not even say anything about it ever again. 

There's alot of other little things too and for the most part the past couple years have been pretty smooth. Now this shit. I'm so sick of my month being ruined because I don't know if they're gonna kick me off the program. Its very convenient too cause hes like 2 mins away from where I live. I enjoy going there, but Im getting so frustrated when they pull this bullshit, I can't enjoy anything cause I feel one day I'm gonna go in and boom! Your gone......

I've been there since January 2015, I always pay, I never miss my appointment....if I do I always rescedule the following day. I gave him a 5 star review on google, which in his case is a favor from me cause so many people have left reviews about his office being unprofessional and a pill mill. 

So anyways, do you guys think they are gonna drop me and I'll have to find a new DR??? Im hoping this is just something they do every year to make sure we're on our best behavior. Plus theres always appointments when hes not there, and it's ""heres your script""...see ya. Thats the way I like it. Ive been on subs since 2011, I dont think I need any guidance for it.

Tl;dr: is it okay/effective to boof Morphine 60s ER if they gel up? And if I cant boof gel, what can I do to make them not gel up? 

Thank you guys in advance and have a wonderful night :)",1556428126.0

Which is an infection of your heart valves from IV use. It's caused by bacteria getting into the shot. I guess my question is how to minimize the risk as much as possible. I'll post my routine and you guys point out what I could do better.

1. Wash my hands and injection site with antibacterial soap.

2. Draw fresh bottled water into clean rig.

3. Mix heroin into bottle cap from freshly opened water

4. Drop cotton from a qtip

5. Mix with plunger from rig. No heat

6. Shoot up.

&nbsp;


1) Waiting in Cliff's unheated rodent infested apartment from midnight to 4:30 AM so that I could bike to the ATM with his card and retrieve ~~his~~ his mom's SSI money so that Cliff could pay back a debt to me. Sometimes he'd front me but usually because I was getting paid in two days anyway.


&nbsp;

2) Waiting after 5:00 AM for Derek to come back from his plug. Anticipating arrival, hearing negotiations like Derek saying ""I wanna go home first and get straight... I'm walking all this distance to get the stuff so I should be able to do that."" Problem is that Derek was always skimming off the top or the side. Cliff of course was always trying to be cheap about what he gives Derek for his middling effort so I can't hate Derek for skimming off the top. 


&nbsp;

3) Thos times toward the end when I went directly through Derek. It was better in some regard than dealing with Cliff and Derek because if Cliff had no dope, I couldn't just use his middling services and not loan him anything until his pay day. So basically I would get half of what I paid for on the day I paid for it and have to wait for the rest. Going through Derek prevented this but also meant that Derek could get away with shit [like mixing my dope with seasoning](https://redd.it/8sn777).


&nbsp;

4) Every time Derek made it sound like he took nothing off the top. Like on my birthday, ""I didn't take anything from this batch because it's your birthday."" Of course he didn't take any bags, he jsut took some out of each bag. I don't think it's fair for him to get nothing but by telling me he took nothing when he did is obviosuly dishonest and leaves it up in the air as to how much he took.... how much lactose powder he mixed with my batch. Gosh, how many nasal infections did I get as a result of stupid ass fillers.


&nbsp;


5) The extra salty batches of heroin I got from Derek. Probably was salt. The fact that I was willing to put a mystery powder in my noise because it's all I had in order to get ""well and a bit high.


&nbsp;

6) When you can't afford enough dope to get high and stay well; in these situations I would just stretch the supply. I was proud of myself at times, making a half oxy get me through a six hour shift by taking it orally or simply dividing up my dope.

&nbsp;

7) Two wasted birthdays. Spent the money on dope.... excitedly awaited birthday money and then spent it on drugs. I don't feel super shitty about it because of the biological urge but I don't feel super proud either. My last birthday on heroin was declared my last because I knew I'd end up dead with a needle, using a needle for life or in a more awkward spot with family and friends.

&nbsp;

8) The bad lighting. I don't know how to describe it exactly, I just remember that if I was in WD, especially if I was withdrawing from a batch of fent-mixed dope, the lighting at work would jsut look strange. Light in color yet dark and harsh. It was a hard transition going from the sunny outside to the dark inside. Riding my bike actually helped a bit but nothing can make you feel better in fent WD when you are in customer service.


Those work days when I tried my darndest to get something before work, but because I Was stupid enough to trust someone like Cliff I was left hanging dry. 

&nbsp;

9) Counting on a ""sure thing"" when the only thing that was high in probability was the odds that something would go wrong. One time my running partner Cliff told me that I ""jynx"" things in a sense and how annoying it was how I worried. I think at least half the time that my worrisome attitude annoyed him was for the same reason he'd scream ""obviously not"" when his mom would scream from her bed ""did the bookie drop off the money?""


From the moment Cliff's mom saw that the money was missing to the time she pestered him to recoup her loss... Cliff knew he had no plan of paying tha money back. He was counting on her not noticing it in the first place. 

&nbsp;

10) Surprise requests for loans of dope. Unlike Cliff, Tim was usually as honeset as possible but he was a victim of circumstance. Like one time he bought dope from his Dboy's ""cousin"" and the guy owed him half a bundle. Time was gonna pay me back a debt with that but the ""cousin"" wasn't the usual guy so whenver he saw the usual guy he'd try to ask about that owed half and he'd be like ""my cousin's business is between you and himm.. we roll separately"" yet they were business partners at the same time.

As it turns out, Tim owed one of them oeny and this tricked to screw my plans up. Tim took care of me a week later, but that was five days after I ran out of dope.


Basically, I'd be looking forward to buying two whole bundles of dope and being able to get high and enjoy the first night only to go home with one bundle and desperate hope.


&nbsp; 


**Bonus:**


* Waiting on the sub connect. 


* Paying for subs in advanced to make things ""easier"" and then not having money to get subs from someone else who actually has them up front.


* That time Cliff was like ""I been in contact with my sister, her friend Laurene will have the subs Friday."" 


* ""Let's enjoy the day, get high and party and then in a couple of days we can worry about getting the subs.""


* Cliff conveniently convincing me that he couldn't get subs all of a sudden and us getting short-lived dope instead. Since I had to loan him half, well it got 1/20th the mileage of subs.


* 15 degrees F bike ride to the ATM.



* Rushing on a 5-mile bike ride before I even begin my bike ride to work just so I can get some dope and get straight.


* One time Cliff did help me in that he texted the guy who owed me two subs and was like ""Sloan is gonna be mad sick at work tomorrow if he don't get those subs you owe him -- he dont' hurt nobody...."" He pleaded on my behalf (or so he said) and at least reminded the guy to the point that he did show up with the cirtrusy-sweet wellness strip.


* My mom and Cliff's mom. I would not have gone down this road if my mom was alive, I knew she'd catch me and I would have hell to pay. She used to accuse me of being on drugs preemptively when I wasn't. So, if I was really on drugs.. well fuck. lol

I'm prescribed hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 4mg for breakthrough pain, but the pill form is shockingly weak to me. Maybe bioavailability is weak? I'm quite tolerant and am on daily hydrocodone 10mg q 6 too.

Eventually I want to drop down to Tramadol because I can manage my daily pain on it and save myself some risk, however I would keep the Dilaudid for breakthrough pain, particularly active urinary tract infections.

How can I alternatively take the Dilaudid which increases the effect so that I can get the best pain relief out of as few pills as possible? Can you mix it with water and inject it (preferably intramuscularly)? I know that's not the smartest and most ideal solution, but this would be a once in a blue moon kind of thing so I'm willing to do what it takes to get the most relief.

Any information is greatly appreciated! Also, is anyone else here managed on daily Tramadol? Does it help you? I'm worried that it's slightly too weak for my daily pain, but I'm trying it either way. Eventually I want to try Nucynta which is a little stronger which is ideal.",1556336735.0

He lives in some shady apartments in a bad part of town and this was the first time he ever asked me to meet him there. I was uncomfortable with it and asked him if he could meet me at the gas station about a half mile away on a main road where I wouldn’t look so shady. He said no, his girl had his car and it would be straight.

It’s worth mentioning I drive a nice car, nice enough to where it looks very weird in the parking lot of a complex like the one I was at. After I parked I turned off the lights but my car leaves the running lights on regardless. Didn’t want to turn the car off in case I needed to get out quick. While I’m waiting a grey Chevy equinox with blacked out windows backs in a few spots to the right of me and the cars turns off. No one gets out.

This should have set off alarms in my head, American made car, late model, tinted windows. In hindsight it screamed undercover. But in my semi dope sick state I thought little of it, probably someone else looking to score. My dude calls me and said he’s looking for my car, I back up a bit so he can see where I am in the lot, while on the phone I mention the car next to me and suggest we take a cruise for a minute and circle back. He says no he’s gotta meet his girl.

So my dude hops in my car. He hands me the dope, two balls that make up a G, not in a bag or anything. I place the two balls on my car’s wireless charging pad above the cup holders for safe keeping. This is important. We talk for a sec, pay him, and he goes to open the door. As soon as the door is cracked a big cop yanks it open and starts yelling. I reach for the dope to eat it, throw it back, one hits the back of my throat and the second bounces off my lip and down into the crack of my seat. The most unlucky rim out of all time. Of all the skittles I’ve eaten and never missed my mouth, at this all important juncture I fucking miss. 

The cop is now screaming and cuffing my dealer, he yells to his partner “driver is eating something!!!” In a flash his partner is on me, has me cuffed before I can protest or say a word. I’m panicking. Never been arrested. Have deadly allergies and need my epipen/inhaler which of course I hadn’t brought. Panicking serious. The original cop comes around and mentions that he saw something fall between my seat and the dash while I was trying to eat it.

My heart sinks. I’m fucked. He saw it fall and he’s going to find it. I sit there with my head hung, cuffed, as they search my car. They are yelling questions at me but I remember my lawyer telling me not to say a word if arrested not to incriminate myself so I’m silent. They yell about this and try to egg me into talking but I won’t. They are still looking in my car. I’m praying they won’t find it. I know they will. 

My dealer is freaking out. Screaming about how we’re just friends and he wasn’t selling me shit. Trying to get me to admit that I bought the dope from someone else. I say nothing. I’m sure they will find the dope ball, bring me in, charge me. My career is over.  My dog is alone at home and I’ve failed him. My parents pending disappointment. Just shocked this is happening. 

At this point the two cops are conferring. The original cop is this big black dude, the second is a short white guy about my age. They had been yelling about finding heroin but they never actually showed me anything they found or stopped searching so I’m hoping they are just talking shit trying to get me to admit to something. Finally they stop searching and the second cop, white guy, tells me to get up and puts me in the front passenger seat of their car.

I’m confused. Never seen an arrest go down like this. They read the Miranda but after that it got weird. In the car he asks me how long I’ve been doing heroin. I’m quiet. He asks me if I’ve ever been arrested before. No. I give him my details and he checks my record. Nothing. He asks me if I have any other dealers. Silence. He asks if I will give him my cell number. Weird but I oblige and give it to him. He says “you know if I let you go you can never fuck with this guy again, he’s going to assume you rolled on him” my heart jumps. I realize I might have a chance at going home.

I tell him, look man I just want to go home. I don’t want to cause any trouble I will go straight home and won’t leave until work tomorrow. He says okay, text me when you get home. During this their radio called and said if you see a blue Chrysler 300 stop it. It drives by right in front of us and his partner walks out and stops it. Two more cop cars pull up moments later, one in front and one in back of the 300. Pull four occupants out and cuff them. Start pulling guns out of the car. I’m watching from the cop car I’m sitting in in shock. Finally the white cop pulls me out and sits me back on the ground by my car. He goes over to help with the guys carrying guns.

I’m sitting there for 5-10 minutes thinking holy shit am I really gonna go home? I get arrested with heroin and they are just gonna let me off? Finally the white cop comes up and uncuffs me. Tells me to go home. I get back in the car, fully in shock. They let my dealer go too. Apparently he didn’t have anything on him. I drive away scared but elated that somehow I’m not on my way to jail. About a mile from there I stop to look under my seat for the dope, maybe they never found it. Nothing. I go to get back in and there it is, sitting on the seat plain as day. I had sat on it. 

I don’t know if they never found it, somehow overlooking it just sitting on the seat. Or if they did find it, figured we weren’t worth their time over .5 and left it in my car. Both scenarios seems implausible but there it is. I go home in complete shock. I even get some of the H after all that.

I text the cop and thank him, tell him I’m home. He tells me to stay sober and stop doing stupid shit. Can’t believe it. A cop that didn’t want to fuck me over a bit of H, just wants me to get my life together. Really cool.

Scary experience but damn I got lucky. It almost seems surreal looking back on it. Like it didn’t happen, when those things happen you end up in jail or rehab, but here I am in my bed. Gotta say those were some cool cops either way. Found out from my dboy they found another .5 on him and they threw it on the ground but still didn’t arrest him. He was even more thankful because he had some serious warrants out. Might have gotten super lucky the dudes with guns got caught right in front of us. Otherwise maybe they would have had time to deal with us. Idk. 

Feel like a very lucky junkie today.",1556330096.0

So I pretended I switched to subs and everything was fine, but they didn’t really buy it. It’s also gotten a lot harder to score now without a car, so I was running out of excuses to borrow theirs.

So I finally just did it...I went to the doctor, thinking i would get a sub rx, but he gave me Lofexidine instead, which basically did nothing except help the sweats a little. I got him to give me klonipin the next day to help my arms and legs, so that was good. But otherwise I feel like i pretty much went cold turkey, but my head was so fogged up from all these medicines that the time passed relatively quickly, thank god.

So my PHYSICAL withdrawal really only lasted a day and a half, which sounds unusual to me, but I’m certainly grateful. But the mental is awful. I shot some subutex this afternoon (day 3), and it helped a little bit. But overall I’m just stuck in bed wondering what the point of getting up is. I truly love heroin...I only ever got high at night, and used low dose, functioning amounts during the day. I felt like a better person, mom, worker, girlfriend, sister...all of it. Without it I can’t find a reason to get up and do anything with myself. I don’t want to stop. I really don’t. I feel like as soon as I get myself a new car, I’m just gonna get right back on and let everyone down because I’m so mad they took the one thing away from me that ever made me feel good about life and that it’s worth living.

A little over a year ago when I had a driving job. I would get random piss test here and there. They came surprisingly rarely for a driving job, once a year at most. Needless to say I got careless over time, especially once smoking tar cAme into the picture.

I was beginning to develop a daily tar smoking habit, then I get the call from my work and it’s that time again for my piss test. It’s a Thursday I believe so and even though you’re supposed to go immediately to test, you could get away with waiting a couple days to go in if you’re schedule was busy so I gave myself probably like 4 or 5 days to cleanse the tar out of my system to figure out a plan. 

I asked another driver at my work who happens to be a major stoner, what he does for drug test. He recommends a product from the local smoke shop which he swore by and has used many times before. I figure why not if he’s passed on it then it has to work. Might I add, I also needed to substitute my urine because I had smoked weed recently as well and most likely would show positive for thc. 

So I get the product and the morning of I follow the instructions, I ended up over heating it in the microwave so it goes above the temperature needed for the test. I keep testing the temperature with one of those metal meat thermometers, sticking it in the fake piss every 5 minutes til it reads about right. It comes in a little container that hides easy and stays warm near your groin. So I feel I’m ready to go to the lab and test and off I go. 


I get to the lab and while I’m outside I check the temperature one more time and I’m good to go! I go inside and check in, take the test, pour the urine behind closed doors and the temperature is on point. Bam! Success, I leave the urine with the paperwork and skip on out of that place! Pleased with my ingenious scheme.


About a week goes by and then one morning I get a call from my work telling me I need to call the drug test company to discuss my results. I instantly freak out and play out all these scenarios in my head and figure the jig is up and they discovered the urine is fake. I’m nervous as hell and I call the lab and they tell me they will call me back.

I post up in a mall parking lot for over an hour waiting and my nerves are racked. Figured they can test for fake urine and found that’s what it was. Then I get the call from the lab technician and he wants to review my results. He tells me the urine tested positive for 6-Monoacetylmorphine, the metabolite present in heroin! I instantly go into denial and play the dumbfounded card. How could this be ?! I used fake urine from the smoke shop. He tells me I could have the sample retested but it’s going to cost me 200$ and they never come back with different results. So I accept the answer and get off the phone with them...

I let my work know what happened and luckily I was in good standing with the boss and told him I’m unsure what the positive was from and maintained heavy denial and I’m willing to do anything to keep my job. He gives me an option of attending a bunch of NA meetings and retesting in a few weeks and I’m able to return to duty. That of which I do and I continue driving...

How could this be tho? I thought for sure I had it in the bag. My theory and my former dealers theory is that tar residue sticks on the fingers for days at a time. And by touching the meat thermometer and putting it back n forth in the urine, I somehow got some of the traces from tar from my fingers and into the fake urine and that’s the only explanation behind how this all happened. 

This was Over a year and a half ago, and although I kept my job that time, I eventually got let go about 6 months later due to some poor decision making while high / trying to get high. Got fired over taking a company car to go sell a 40 sack which the dude didn’t even pay me for . Lost my decent paying in the end all due to my inability to control my tar habjt.

I hope this story serves as a cautionary tale to those always stressing about drug test and just to be super clean and cautious as to how you handle your substituted urine. You can never be too careful! 

Hope everyone has a safe weekend and makes some better choices than what I made during those times. Cheers to my opiate family !",1556311912.0

HARM REDUCTION

THE ART -
Harm Reduction is a practice that everyone should know and be educated on. Especially if you use and or know someone who use substances recreationally. Harm reduction to be effective needs to be accepted in our society and we all know that drug use is present in our communities. How can we help those who need it when all we do is judge?

Principles -
-Accepts, for better and or worse, that licit and illicit drug use is part of our world and chooses to work to minimize its harmful effects rather than simply ignore or condemn them.
-Understands drug use as a complex, multi-faceted phenomenon that encompasses a continuum of behaviors from severe abuse to total abstinence and acknowledges that some ways of using drugs are clearly safer than others.
-Establishes quality of individual and community life and well-being–not necessarily cessation of all drug use–as the criteria for successful interventions and policies.
-Calls for the non-judgmental, non-coercive provision of services and resources to people who use drugs and the communities in which they live in order to assist them in reducing attendant harm.
-Ensures that drug users and those with a history of drug use routinely have a real voice in the creation of programs and policies designed to serve them.
-Affirms drugs users themselves as the primary agents of reducing the harms of their drug use and seeks to empower users to share information and support each other in strategies which meet their actual conditions of use.
-Recognizes that the realities of poverty, class, racism, social isolation, past trauma, sex-based discrimination and other social inequalities affect both people’s vulnerability to and capacity for effectively dealing with drug-related harm.
-Does not attempt to minimize or ignore the real and tragic harm and danger associated with licit and illicit drug use.
 (Harm Reduction Coalition)

IN DEEP -
I have experienced the disease we call addiction. It isn’t pretty, and it isn’t something easy to talk about. I have found communities online or more specifically reddit, that have listened and gave advice not just to me, but to others who are looking to be accepted. These anonymous chats have helped tremendously with harm reduction and dosages of substances as most medical officials/big pharmacy companies can’t legally test.

I will be talking about harm reduction specifically with opioids and referencing some posts on the subreddit “r/opiates”.

        The definition of harm reduction states “any program, organization, and legal right that aims toward safe drug use and drug practices.”. What actions are our government taking to follow this practice? Well since 1991 the only specific Government Approved programs are Sub/Methadone Clinics and Needle Exchange Organizations. Ironically these Needle Exchange organizations came out to combat the HIV/AIDs epidemic but was not even addressed 10 years later. In 2005 Drug Harm Reduction advocates were ecstatic to hear about the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs meeting, hoping change was coming to America. Abstinence-Only stayed as the official ruling with Japan and Russia siding with the United States, 17 other countries fought this ruling.

        New potential laws are being discussed on forums and even making there way to some officials who could have the power to make change. Such as, decriminalizing all overcharged nonviolent drug offenses, eliminating felony charges with personal amount cases, move away from the harsh jail-time offenses and instead implement treatment options like Out/In-Patient programs, and changing suboxone and methadone to a Over the Counter Drug, with consultation of a licensed pharmacist, to help users speed up the process or worse, sourcing “*said*” chemicals illegally. – (r/*)

        Naloxone is something every single person should be carrying around in todays society even if you don’t use or don’t spend time with people who do. “The more naloxone out there, the better chance of someone having it when an overdose occurs.”  -(r/*). Naloxone (Evzio) is used to reverse the effects of Narcotic Drugs, Narcan is the most effective opioid overdose reversal medication, and should be administered nasally right away if symptoms of an overdose are sighted. Narcan is something our society also needs to accept and should be carried by everybody.

        In conclusion legal reform needs to be discussed. It is essential that we the people accept that drugs are in our communities, accept Harm Reduction Practices, allow less restrictions with suboxone and methadone, and of course be safe and don’t judge others.

I heated up the the pee for 30 seconds in the microwave before going which ended up being stupid hot and had to cool it down enough and I places it under my breast... not sure if it kept the right temp. And then I also spilled some pee on the counter so I used a napkin to soak some up and squeeze it back in there, lol. I think that was idiotic. Then when I poured the pee at the office it seemed off a bit in appearance! Did I screw myself? This was the one and only time I wanted and would need to do this. And my first appointment...

I want to tell you about the greatest dealer I ever had and how I wish every dealer was exactly how this guy was. 

With him - you could always count on him. He had a spot that he operated from everyday and always was on time - from 1AM to 8 AM he’d be in that spot for years. Even during the times where he had nothing or was waiting to re-up, he’d bring another dealer to make sure people who came didn’t leave sick and hopeless. If he was sick or couldn’t come - he’d always have someone there with his stuff. 

Up to 6PM, he’d be only available at his house and only made deliveries if people bought enough or paid extra for delivery cost. 

He had a selection of stuff from smack to white girl powder to rock. 

With the Square App (Point of Sale App) he took gift cards, debit cards and credit cards. 

He often let you trade - you could barter with him almost anything from women’s cosmetics to bounty paper towels to headphones and cellphones. 

If you were a long client and knew you weren’t in a method one program or if you had a job he’d never leave you sick. 

He always gave credit to all his customers who had jobs. 

He got you if you were short. He’d take change if you couldn’t change them into bills. 

You could take credit from him but only to half of what you got from your paycheck. So if you made 500 he’d only give you 250 credit. 

His interest for credit was at $3 per bag. 

So if you took 2 on credit, you’d owe him $26 when your paycheck came in a week or two. 

This man was my dealer for eleven years. Yesterday he died at the hospital- still trying to find out what happened from his wife. 

I wish you guys could of dealt with this guy. 

I don’t know what I’ll do now. Starting a relationship and getting close with another dealer won’t do justice as I’m sure he won’t even operate how this guy did.",1556263871.0

Like, if over the weekends went down 1mg or 2mg, per day, if I went to zero, would I get full withdrawl?
Or if I took it for a week, then stop. Will the withdrawl be gentler?

Other idea, is to jump off of four, on sat morning. Get stuff. No sub all weekend, cover the efects with street. Then on Monday, go to kratom.
Subs should be gone enough for the kratom to work? And let myself down gentler?

I am on methadone basically because I'm self medicating some mental health issues such as crippling social anxiety. generalized anxiety and BPD. also depression ect.. 40 mg a day and if I miss my drink one day or even a second day in a row I'm fine. even fell off the program multiple times from not making it into get my drink because it's not that much of a pressing or serious matter for myself. has anyone ever heard of this or have experienced this themselves? and yes I have binged on hydro morph 12's and mixed high doses of all kinds for days and days even weeks and never withdrawl. I can go for a month on 50 milligrams of methadone to nothing and I wake up fine, and keep waking up fine the day after and the day after that. 

when it comes right down to it, is opiate addiction psychological?

Every month I drag myself in here propped up only by the DXM I took to take the edge off my benzo, barbiturate, and amphetamine withdrawals. 


Shaking I make my way up to the counter trying to look normal.


“Yes I'd like to pick up some prescriptions for J”


I provide my birthday and last name and inevitably I'm sent to the chairs to wait. Tapping my foot to ease my restless legs I try and browse Reddit but I have no focus. Instead I look at the people around me, normal people, waiting on their antidepressants or other meds. My body fills with envy and disgust.


“You will never know the nirvana that lies within reach of a few extra pills.” I think.


A kid and his dad walk up to the counter and I overhear the name Percocet. I perk up as the beast within me knows all too well what it's hungry for.


But those days are behind me or so I convince myself. Knowing all too well what I would do for that 10 year olds script. Instead I remain seated eyeing the temporary cast the kid has on.


Allowing my mind to wander I remember Easter almost 7 years ago.




I was a dumbass skater punk ripping down all the hills back in my hometown. The day before Easter I crashed and broke both bones in my forearm. The doctor who reset my bones said it was a surprise to see a wrist that was as bad as mine. My bones had turned from where they should have been to opposite sides. In short, it was agony. That was until I got a bottle of 60 Percs.


Broken bones were nothing new to me and neither were the hydro and oxy scripts, but now I was in charge of my own bottle.


On the first night I took my prescribed dose of one perc 10, just enough to make the pain bearable. Finally my arm didn't feel like it had been run over, and a deep sleep came. Four hours later on the dot I woke up screaming from the couch downstairs.


The bottle was two rooms away in the kitchen cabinet, but those 20 yards may as well have been across the continent. With tears streaming down my face I pulled out my ultra cool Razer and dialed the home phone, waking the entire household.


“Mom! Please just give me two.” I pleaded and begged her.


“I'm sorry baby but the bottle says take one every four to six hours.” She replied, bottle in hand.


“Please! Just two! I just want to sleep!” I cried.


Two pills appeared in my open hand, instantly I popped both and profusely thanked my mother.


As the pain faded the extra pill began to shine as any frequent chipper would expect. Mmmm the warm opiates waved over my mind, singing a sweet siren song of bliss. As much as I wanted to enjoy the high at 4am I let myself slumber away.


The next day on Easter I was starving, not for the deviled eggs or the ham, I wanted more Percocet. I took my morning dose of one and limped on, not high but not in pain. Then I began calculating my plan.


Being 18 I decided to make the most of my script early on and deal with the consequences later. Searching the medicine cabinet I found some Tylenol that looked close enough to the Percs. Replacing the Percs with Tylenol was genius in my adolescent mind.


I spent the next week strategically planning my highs, the dose, the time, who would be home, every detail. I was high as a kite, floating in the opiate ocean 4 times that week. All while I took my replacement Tylenol in case my parents got suspicious.



“I used to be so smart” I muttered under my breath, when the pharmacist called my name.


As I left the counter I clutched my precious cargo. I walked by the kid and his dad, praying he wouldn't end up like me. Part of me wanted to say a word of caution to him, but I didn't. instead I decided to open the bag in the parking lot and chew up three Valium, four Fiorinal, and two Adderall. 


“It is refill day after all, one must celebrate” I said while Motley Crue blasted Live Wire. 


Five minutes later at home I lay on my bed still dreaming of the days of uninterrupted bliss, with no thoughts of the pain and cost. But none of that matters when you feel a high coming on.",1556249552.0

For some background, I have mild tolerance, in that it takes around 10mg oxy for pain relief, and above 15mg pushes into la-la land. My surgeon is currently away, so there might be a few day gap between when I can get a real script, and my pain is sucking due to a mild stumble. 

I have been taking these ORALLY to good effect without any side effects -- decent pain relief with half a pill, but definitely did not feel like the pharmacy oxy I was prescribed. I came to realize that they're probably not legit - despite appearances - so I went and tested them with with strips from dancesafe. Two different pills confirmed fent.

I have several left, which I want to continue to use to help with pain, but I'm a bit hesitant. My goal here is to help with pain and take these SAFELY. So, I was wondering what would be the *safest* route of administration would be? Again, I'm not concerned with efficacy or getting especially high -- this is just to help with pain as I work things out with my surgeon to get another legit script.

My thinking was to crush the pills, and mix with water, while measuring amounts, and then sipping X% of the water every 30 minutes or so.

Based on what I've read, this will limit the risk of any OD via hitting an unintentional hotspot, and given the bioavability of oral fent, I should be okay. I also intend to let a friend who lives in my building what I'm doing, and to text him periodically. 


TLDR - Have very legit looking MBOX 30mg pills which tested positive for fent. Want to know SAFEST way (efficacy irrelevant) to take them, as my goal is to help with pain more than anything. Proposed method is dissolving in water and sipping bit by bit.",1556248575.0

first post ever here but I'm an old lurker. Just wanted to share my story and success about quitting opiates after 4 years of daily use (began at 17yo, smoked plugged and IVed). Allthough at the end I was on methadone (75 to 100mg) for a year, I still used heroin/fent (mostly fent as I had access to a prescription) and the metha for withdrawals.

I went to a psychiatric hospital 3 times and the last one worked allthough they made me quit methadone COLD TURKEY (they gave me a shit ton of valium though, like 100mg daily). And well, as you guys know: it was worse than hell physically for freaking 2 months and then the psychologic aspect began...

I was craving opiates so much I had to start smoking weed again (was also a big addiction for me in my 15-16th, like 50g a week). But now I managed to control it to ""only"" two joints a day before bed time. I tried Kratom and loved it but at the moment I can't afford it due to my weed use.

I also forgot to mention I have crippling anxiety (diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder) and chronic depression (these started way before any drug use, allthough drugs must have surely enhanced it). 

I'm now on sertraline (zoloft) 200mg and wellbutrin 300mg daily - both for depression as it does nothing to my anxiety. It kinda works, more than any other medication anyway. I talked to my doctor about Kratom and he said he's not against it but I should be careful nonetheless. 

My doc also prescribed me xanax as my anxiety has gone up the last few months. And... it works wonders (I think I wouldn't be sharing my story if I had not taken one earlier). I'm extremely cautious about my use as I have an addictive personality. I'm aware of all the dangers and I try not to take it to often (even though it's hard as my anxiety is unbearable and it ruins my life). But since I have xan I slowly feel that I can adapt to this shitty society and I almost cried the other day because of it helping me so much. I'm starting to have friends and I'm starting to think now I could try higher education again (failed 3 times due to my anxiety/depression and drug use).

Sorry for my looong ass post. But it felt good writing it even if no one reads it. Thanks for those who did :)

Tldr: today I've been off opiates for 6 months !",1556214297.0

Just wanted to run this through the community because I’ve never had this happen before. So I got my usual from my usual connect. I’ve been dealing with her forever (8+years) and I trust her. She usually is amazing to deal with and no bull. I always get 30s from her and the kind they are always depends. This time, they were the yellow round 30 mg with the t 189 imprint. Ive gotten those from her before so I put them in the baggy and went about my business.

Today I took the bag out to do one and I noticed that there is some powder residue rubbing out into the bag. That hasn’t happened to these before as far as I can remember. So I’m a little weary. So I snort one and it def burns. I don’t have the drip/taste that I am used to either. Now it’s been a while since I’ve had the yellows so I’m wondering if maybe I forgot. But now I have some numbness with my drip too. 

I’m not overly high. I don’t feel like it hit me hard or anything it’s just different. Are these fent? I don’t do dope usually and I can count on one hand the times I have so I just know something is different. I also usually get energy from my pills and I’m dragging.

Once upon a time (yesterday), Ol' Papi Percocet was given a super legit primo contact from my main middle. He is a good dude, stand up guy and I think he just had enough of the crap and decided I could just deal with them. So I make contact with the new source and told to meet up 30 min from my home at 11:30. ""Please be on time! :) Then we will drive 10 minutes to go grab the stuff in ""The Cities"" The Cities are twins but one of them is ugly and old, yuck. I get to the set location at 11:25, Ol' Papi Percocet is a punctual man, ladies ;) and let her know that I am here. ""Ok, 5 min!""...so i wait, I wait some more, and wait... half hour later she comes rolling in in a car that's about to break down and die right there... "" Hey man, can you drive? I don't have any gas."" Great sign. Whatever, not like I want to drive in that POS as it is, I'll probably get Tetanus or Hep C. The middle brought her two crackhead friends as well! The more the merrier, merryer? Now, I am not bragging, just trying to paint a picture of Ol' Papi Percocet's car. It is a 2015 Audi A6 Supercharged, it is very nice, I keep it pristine and clean. It is also my family's car. It is just as much my little boy's as it is mine. He has a great set up in the back with his car seat and the extra leg room in the A6. So they need room to sit so i have to rip out the carseat and throw it in their car, yes i checked for needles sticking in it after. Immediately they crack open a window and start smoking cigarettes before I could tell them not to smoke in my son's car. Already irritated... So guess what? We have to go pick up ANOTHER person! My middle, has a fucking Middle! My Middle, his middle and her Middle... fuck my life. So we go to pick her up! Sitting waiting another half hour for this lady to walk ten feet out of her apartment to our car. So what do the little crackheads my middle brough do? Start fucking smoking Meth in my car without asking! AGGGH. The other middle is handicapped with the cane, fine. Out walks this YHUUUGE African American Lady, 5 people squeezed into the car, and a morbidly obese lady in my front see kicking the floor cause she doesn't have enough room in a full size executive car. Whatever, ill be done with these people in 10 minutes, right? WRONG! Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady has to drive back into The Cities, the nice one. To get her paycheck before anything can happen. Ol' Papi Percocet, is not a happy camper but he buckles down and starts driving, pretty much back to his house knowing he will have to drive back and drop them off. So as we are driving down, I find out the reason why we are dragging our feet is because there are another two people we are meeting up with, who were supposed to pick up Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady at 11:30 but they were late from driving from a city 3 hours away and she is fuming and ignoring their calls, so as I am driving they are blowing this up and she has her phone ringer fully on just blasting some Hardcore Rapper CONSTANTLY. Finally, she answers and just starts screaming at them, jut full on chaos and I have to listen on speaker as these other crackheads are giving every excuse in the book, begging, BEGGING, Pleading for her to help them score their dope after she said she wasn't fucking with them today. Idiots drove 3 hours to get here and couldn't fucking be on time, not my fault, not even Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady. She needed to be picked up at 11:30 to make this work for 7 people, I got her frustration, but damn, Ol' Papi Percocet's ears were hurting. We finally get downtown and Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady goes to pick up her check so I'm sitting with my Middle's Middle and the two crackheads who are begging me to let them smoke meth in my car, I guess they couldnt get out of the car and smoke it on the street. So, Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady tells us to sit put because she will be 10 minutes in and out, and I know how she is on time. So Baby Jr Crackhead as I called him decides he has to go tinkle, Dowtown, in the middle of fucking lunch hour looking like a Baby Jr Crackhead with all the business professionals walking around, so he dips cause he has got to go tinky. Fucking Idiot, SSIBL comes back out, in ten minutes and BJC isnt there, so she goes off again screaming and yelling. Just fuck my life. SSIBL explains we have to be there at a certain time or the guy is gone, Finally BJC runs back out and we start moving to go meet the out of town crackheads down the street at at a specific clear location given to them. Guess what, they arent there. SSIBL starts going ballistic again calling them, These crackheads are so lost and out of it they have no idea, all they do is plead and BEG to SSIBL about how sorry they are and what big pieces of shit they are. Just amazes me how much berating and agreement someone can take to get their dope. PLEEEAAASE, PLEAAASE SSIBL! Whatever, finally find them and we go to Northside to finally meet up with My Middle's Middle's Middle's Dude. My Middle's Middle is short and SSIBL goes off again, so she blames it on me, thanks a lot...And the wait begins again. I am like 4 hours into this thing at the end of it. We finally get it and I start the drive back and the fucking crackheads and Middle's Middle start fucking smoking the dope 3 packed in the back of my car, Now I am fucking screaming along with SSIBL. ""DUde, we are so sick....PLEEEEASE"". Not Like I'm not fucking sick, but I fucking wait because of its not suspicious in the dope capital of my state to have a nice ass car in the hood, with 3 crackhead looking white people in the back with a obese Sassy Strong Independent Black lady in the back... she was super sweet though, you know how they are. After i get all the crackheads out of my car she apologizes to me saying I have been nothing but sweet, she shorts all there bags to give me extra an then gives me an extra half.

I used daily from 18 to 23 and then spent the last five years pecking away occasionally. Eventually one of the times overdosed me and I decided I needed to get serious and got the shot. That was 8 months ago and I've gotten it monthly since then. 

When you first get sober, life is going to suck for a few months. That is true whether you are on viv or not. I feel that many people claim that viv stopped all of their happiness and all that as soon as they started taking it, but those folks hadn't been clean for six months to see how shitty you feel when you take your first opiate break in ten years. 

In my five years of chipping I had made a point of getting in shape, lifting in the winter and running in the summer. Over time I switched to mostly running half marathon distances. I run about 35 miles a week and can win most of my local 5 and 10 k races. I'm not a pro or anything but I'm a strong runner. 

When I first got on viv I felt like my running and lifting was done. Doing bench press I felt like the weight was heavier and running my legs felt like lead. I was convinced the viv did it to me. I got it in my head and hated it like crazy but I HAD to keep taking it. I have a house and a partner and pets and a god damn fantastic job that I couldn't lose. 

So I knuckled down and ran through it. I truly believe that it did have some minor negative effects in the first week, but after a few long runs, within the first two weeks, I was feeling a distinct runners high from my long runs. 

I want to repeat. As an athlete who works out 7 days a week, it does not kill the runners high. I know there will be people who are going to contradict this but I'm willing to bet that 99% of them who claim it kills the rush from running or working out were not running or working out regularly before they got on viv. They were doing dope all day. 

I say to people who want to get into fitness that you need to dedicate two months to it. 3x a week for two months is enough for your body to get used to it and for working out to switch from sucking to feeling good. 

I'm not going to say that viv will work for everyone in terms of side effects, but don't tell yourself ""I can't do it because it will kill runners high"" if you haven't gotten off your ass in the last two years. You aren't going to get runners high from anything if you aren't in shape at all. Viv is worth a shot though because if you are ready to get clean and willing to get 12 shots, it WILL WORK for you in terms of keeping you alive. I'm staying on it a few more months to continue to work out my issues but all that time I'm going to be collecting race t shirts and hardware!",1556202348.0

I went in expecting nothing as I only had documentation from the hospital years ago and I’m young, but my doctor was very kind and cool and young and seemed eager to give me medication. As soon as I came in for the appointment I peed for them in case I was prescribed meds. Then he straight up asked if I need prescription strength medication to which I replied “I’m here because I do believe that and I am in pain, yes.” 

He asked which meds to which I told him I would trust his judgement. He prescribed physical therapy and tramadol first. I could have probably asked for hydrocodone but he was being so cool and compassionate that I was too shocked. He asked me to go get an mri and an xray and to come back in two weeks for more medication. I will tell him the tramadol is making me sick and not helping as much with the pain which is true.

As a restaurant manager I constantly have to talk to people, during a shift I get just a few short breaks where I can just be alone. I’ve been doing pills for maybe 8-9 years now, starting around freshman year of high school and perks specially for a little more then half that time and now really trying to get my life together but one of my real problems is work. Like I said before I’m a restaurant manager so I’m constantly going from employees to customers and more then not somebody’s not happy and I have to fix it. Along with a job that requires 45-55 hours a week I’ve been trying to take a couple classes a community college for a degree in business management but the combination of all of that and wanted to quit pills is a lot at once. When I’m high I’m hardworking while still making the best of it, having fun with everyone, very talkative but every time I try to get clean it seems to me to be the opposite, I get a lot of “are you alright”s, all I wanna do is sit in the office and bringing myself to talk to customers is damn near impossible. 

With all that being said I get I’m withdrawing but after that ends am I going to get back to the hardworking, fun, easygoing person I was while I was high? I’ve worked years from being a cook up to manager all while doing more and more drugs as it went on and if I’m not the same person then what happens to my job? My income? My future? 

Just makes me think something if I can learn to control it better I can just get by as a functioning junky of shorts. Sounds terrible in theory but I don’t know what to do, rehab is not for me, I can’t leave my life and job and school for an extended period of time with no questions asked but I really do want to be clean but if I lose everything I know and love I don’t really know if it’s worth it.",1556159390.0

I have my intake set up for Monday to start on methadone maintenance. I’ve been using oxycodone for a few years, and honestly it’s just waaaaay to expensive. I tried suboxone, and I just couldn’t get it. I was good for I think the longest stretch was about 2 weeks. I honestly just couldn’t get past the cravings I just finally caved and used. I kept going back and trying subs and that would last a few days, then go back to oxys again. I also got severe anxiety while on the subs, and my stomach was just really queasy too. I would literally take like 2 bites of food and start getting nauseous as hell, and the smell of everything felt like it was magnified like 1000%. 
But anyway I’m just tired of the chase, lying to my family, stealing money from my husbands business, and just hurting everyone around me. At least with the methadone it would be 85/wk, so I’d be saving sooooo much money. 
I just don’t know how to approach my husband with this. He does Percocet but he can control it. He only does like 5-7.5 mg of them, and that’s plenty for him. Me, if I don’t have minimum like 210 mg a day, I feel like total shit and am in like so much pain. That’s how I started on the oxys to begin with, I have bulging discs in C3-C4, C4-C 5 and L-4-L5, L 5-S-1. I take gabapentin, and cymbalta for the nerve issues and flexeril and oxycodone for pain. I heard that buprenorphine could help with the pain but I didn’t see any relief. I also can’t take any nsaids, I’m allergic and I swell up and break out in hives.
Ok, so how do I approach my husband about the methadone? He’s gonna bring up about me trying the suboxone and that not working. My sister is currently on methadone and he always has nasty comments about it. He’s tired of my spending and using oxys but I really don’t see him understanding wanting to go on methadone. How can I convince him that I don’t want to keep going on the way I am and I feel like this is my last shot at trying something different. I don’t wanna lose my family over the pills, and I can’t just stop.

I thought I'd post here, because there's great minds here, though I will post in r/drugnerds & a couple opiate recovery/subutex/suboxone subs.

So I've never had a problem with my subutex doctor, hes a genuinely nice guy, & I've never failed any drug tests (dipstick/cup) except my first one obviously to get on the subutex.

But for the last months I've been researching etizolam, diclaz, flublam (briefly) but flualprazolam more frequently & at higher doses. He never tested me since my initial test more than a year ago & trusted me.

Well... today I had to let them test my piss. All because I missed an appointment & rescheduled an appt almost 2 weeks from the appt i missed. I knew I'd come up positive for benzos, so I admitted I had been taking a family member's Valium or Xanax on nights I couldn't sleep (He knows I have minor cerebral palsy & get bad leg cramps & spasms, RLS, & just general sleep issues).

So now I'll be kicked out of the only subutex program in my town. Which sucks, because I planned to taper down my 1 - 3mg a day/every other day dose & switch to kratom, which I have a decent amount of.

I'm starting my diclazepam taper this week because I want off the benzos. Got a lil over a gram of diclaz & a bottle of everclear.

But my next sub appt is in a month from today for Friday at 11:30am. 

Starting my diclaz taper worries me due to its halflife. So I thought diluting it, or using a clean friends piss & adding a tiny amount of water with a tiny amount of subutex dissolved in it & add it to the cup of piss.

That last plan sounds like it might not work because they use a cup test for subutex separately, which I'm sure looks for metabolites..

To accurately do this, it's recommended you crush an entire pill and test it, as simply taking a chip might happen to contain a section with no fent, while fent exists in another part of the pill.  Then you need to either wait a couple days for the water to evaporate, or you can just drink it.  

Here's the thing though - anyone have any experience with this?  Because the pills tested NEGATIVE for fent, even after multiple tests.  To my knowledge I did everything correctly - mixed one tsp water with one 30, mix thoroughly.  I know this sounds like great news but I just cant believe someone, especially this dude, has access to a decent amount of real 30s.  They look legit, test negative, but still just wondering if anyone has experience with this and has any knowledge about why a false negative might happen.

I would do them just once or a couple times a week because they were impossible to come by. But one day, I found a solid supply of 10/325 oxys. I experimented with them and at some point, I found my perfect dose. It was 30mg oxy potentiated with 800mg cimetidine (makes it stronger). It was heavenly. It felt like someone had pulled a warm blanket over me and then I'd just nod off and have vivid day dreams. 

My tolerance eventually grew extremely quick with the oxy. I could 10 of the 10mg pills at once and that would *just* be enough to give me a warm buzz. After my oxy ran out, I decided to switch over to smoking #3 heroin. 

I've been doing it for several weeks now, on and off, and no matter how much I smoke, I have not ever gotten that warm blanket feeling I used to get with oxy and other opiates. 

Nowadays when I smoke, all it does it makes me really drowsy, and I nod out. That's still pleasant for me, which is why I keep using, but I really miss the warm blsnket feeling and the euphoria. Those were the best part.

I guess it could be a tolerance thing, but my tolerance really isn't *that* high. I've only been smoking ~0.5g a day of mediocre dope.

I will do it a bit different but still a bit the same, hard to  explain. Third: I just want to know if you guys ever got such a medical report paper in the USA? I know it may be a stupid idea but it also may work since I bet 100€ that they wont call the doctor I am picking also I will go there when the doc in the US is closed.

Methadone seems to have a slightly lower bioavailability rectally, BUT it hits pretty much directly. You reach almost maximum plasma levels in \~5 minutes whereas orally it takes about 1h to reach the same level. And if i understand it right. The duration stays the same. = You get 1 more hour of ""happiness"". Anyone using this method? Thinking i should maybe try.

Codeine causes your body to release histamimes, this will cause negative effects. 
So a strong antihistamine commonly promethazine must he takea alongside to combat this.
So more codeine = more prometh, more prometh = more sleepy.

Here's why I think recreationally it's not worth the time of day. 
When I am having a day off or 2 from work I like to use drugs and enjoy activities I enjoy.
Or even just relax anr enjoy the day.
I personally wouldn't want to spend my day sleeping or trying to combat sleep and be mindless.
I feel like that is a waste of limited time before you're back to work.

You also hear lots of people talk about using it in the party scene. Why would you spend your time at a party nodding off on the couch when it's a time of socializing.

I do believe it is great for it's intended medicinal use, when you are ill rest is important so codeine syrup is great at assisting with your rest.
Outside of that I think it just doesn't fit with the idea of recretion.

(Please read details before commenting),"**I realize it's a dangerous combo. Nay, a deadly combo. Possibly the deadliest. But bear with me:** (Everything I'm talking about here is taken orally by the way.)

My opiate tolerance is ungodly. I need the equivalent of 100mg of morphine to get a nice buzz going. 150 to get nice and high. I don't even nod at 200 and I never bothered to test my nodding threshold because money is tight. Even drinking 300ml (~10 oz) of pure 100% white grapefruit juice on an empty stomach 30 minutes before consuming my opiates barely cuts a dent.

My benzo tolerance is even more ungodly if you can believe it. Let me put that into perspective for you: Anything less than 4mg of clonazepam (or the equivalent dose of another benzo) I don't even feel (to the point that if was roofied with 3mg of klonopin I guara-fucking-tee I wouldn't even know). I can act, feel, and look sober to anyone around me on 6mg of kpin. I only start feeling kpin at 8mg (but still look sober). I stop looking sober only at 10mg and above, but I can still walk straight. 2mg kpin used to give me the mother of all blackout amnesias. But now? not even 12mg would do it.

All of that being said, I'm not suicidal so I want to play it safe: To take a mere 75mg IR morphine with an even meager 2mg kpin. But before the other questions, does the order matter?

1. *Would* that be safe for someone who's too tolerant for his own good?

2. If it is safe, would I even feel it?

3. If I would feel it, would the morph potentiate the kpin - or vice versa?

4. Lastly, if you think I won't get high off this combo, what's my next move? How much morp should I add? how much kpin?

***Update Alert:*** About ~1 hour ago I took 75mg morph on an empty stomach (granted I took antacids 2 minutes prior as I've heard it's recommended).

* 30 Minutes In: Absolutely no effect. Not even dilated pupils, so then I took 2mg kpin.

* 60 Minutes In: Feeling warm and fuzzy. No euphoria. No elevated mood. Started to itch. Pupils are normal. (My guess: Opioids constrict pupils while benzos dilate them. Perphaps the two effects cancelled each outher out.)

* Still not satisfied, I just took another 15mg morph. If I see no results in the next 30 minutes I'll be adding 2mg more of kpin. If still no desirable results I'm going to cut my losses and research boofing.",1556096713.0

My PCP and the ER docs surprisingly hooked it up. First ER visit I received 15mg morphine IV which was my first IV experience and it did nothing, not even a small amount of pain relief.  My second visit I received 1mg hydromorphone three times in two hours and it still did nothing. On my last visit I received IV fent which finally helped, but more than anything it made me sleepy and didn’t help with the pain. 
This whole time I was getting decent scripts ( 28 5mg norco, 20 5mg oxy, and then 37 10mg norco). When I was able to leave the couch from my pain I shared with friends and 10mg norco had most of them pretty faded, meanwhile I had to take 70-90mg of norco or 50mg oxy to catch even a slight nod. 
Even from the first norco dose I had to take 50mg to even feel any relief/mild euphoria, and before that I hadn’t chipped in like 6 months at least. So it sucks that I can’t really get any pain relief, but I feel lucky that I have a shit liver and can’t really get high off opiates.

Chipper.
Current tolerance is at around 15mg Oxycodone to feel nice, 40mg to nod.
Done everything except Methadone and Opana.

I have IV'd Dilly many times in the past and it quickly became my second favourite opioid. I love it, but it is short, albeit powerful and I can get a lot of it.

So here is the deal, I haven't slammed any of the the good stuff in a long time, as you can tell. What would be an appropriate dosage for my current tolerance? Not for the Dilaudid, that's easy. The Pharma-H. I would only IV.

The problem lies with the H. It could last me quite a while with my tolerance and chip eating protocol. 5-10mg is a dose for opioid naive individuals and this is under slow administration of the drug.

I know at this point if I injected 6mg of Dilly I would be flooded by endorphins to the brink of insanity.

Basically, I’m an opiate addict and have a pretty solid plug for whatever opiates I need, mainly fake fent pills and heroin. Now there’s been times where I haven’t been in town and my plug has sent me maybe $50-$150 dollars worth of pills in the mail and everything worked fine. 

Now I had an old customer of mine hit me up asking if I could send him 3-4 mexis, about $70 worth. And I said I couldn’t but gave him my plug who had mailed me stuff before. This kid confirmed with me that I could trust him and these were my words down to the letter 

“I mean yea I’ve dealt with him for awhile and he’s sent me stuff thru the mail before but I’m not gonna say 100% either way because I don’t want this to be on me if something happens”

Keep in mind when this kid hit me up he was asking for less then $100 dollars worth of drugs. Well he hit up my plug and for whatever fuckin reason didn’t think twice about sending my plug a fucking grand, without ever meeting the dude or even seeing any proof that the drugs were sent. 

THEN he has the balls to be upset with me, and really fell for the “sorry man send another $500 and I’ll get em shipped I had some complications” bs. Kid blew $1,500 without even considering what he was doing. 

Then goes off on me when I tell him he’s much better off on the dnm. All I’m saying is that no matter who you’re dealing with, most people in this game will burn you if you’re talking about money in the quadruple digits. ESPECIALLY if you’re some random square in another city that he’s never met. I feel partly bad for the kid but like who does this? If there’s any rich Nigerian princes looking to hook someone up with a large sum of money I think I found your man..

I didn’t even lose a thing and I still feel sick to my stomach even thinking about this kids situation. Who starts that big? I’m hoping the dude is rich and can afford that kind of loss because I can’t think of any other scenario where you’d even consider commuting to that but Man.. just a little heads up Incase anyone here is that unaware, ppl in this game, especially the opiate game want your money. If you have business to offer you will probably have a good relationship but $1,500 is probably more then he’d ever make keeping you as an actual customer and they have absolutely 0 actual consideration for your well being 99% of the time so think things thru. Don’t do transactions like these unless it’s thru the dnm or is with a plug you already know well in person.

And to follow that up, does subutex have their own WDs that i will have to deal with, if I were to switch over for the next 5 days? 

I took a small bump of a subutex Yesterday afternoon, 24hrs after my last   Oxy dose, and it made my minor WDs ( sweats, cloudy head, headache, and the un ability to eat) Go away. 

I’m tryna get clean before I go on Vacation so I’m not sick the whole time, but I’m not 100% sure how subutex works in your body other then blocking opioids, and I don’t wanna end up dependent on Subutex, if that’s even possible.

TLDR can I use subutex to get off oxy without having to feel any WDs from either the Subutex or Oxy ? 
 
Also, can I use Xanax or Valium while on Subutex ?",1556030111.0

bga1gr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bga1gr/dangers_of_kratom/,21,https://redd.it/bga1gr,addictAnswers08,Dangers of Kratom," The Dangerous of Kratom...

I know this post is going to spark a lot of debate. Believe me I would have been pro Kratom until I saw what it was doing to by body after two years of abuse. 

I was first introduced to Kratom by an ex boyfriend. He was from Colorado and a friend told him about it. We went to the smoke shop and bought one bottle of the powdered Kratom. It tasted horrible. We were told to get the most effective high we would have to mix it with orange juice. Immediate euphoria followed. I also felt like I spent years struggling with depression and anxiety and suddenly I felt focused, friendly, and motivated. I went back two days later and bought more. I loved how it made me feel but the taste was off putting and it was slowly starting to affect my finances. I noticed I was running out of money faster because I started buying the powder almost every other day just to keep up with the tolerance. 

My ex boyfriend and I broke up and I continued to use the Kratom as a means to stay less depressed and have more energy. I continued using for about 7 months and even though I was being paid more at my new job I found I was still going through money like mad. I noticed one week I started to get opposite effects. I became moody and aggressive. I felt no matter how much I took it was making things worse. I decided I was going to go cold turkey off of Kratom. I felt bad for about 2-3 days meaning I had some anxiety but it was manageable. I remember about two weeks after quitting a co-worker came up to me and said to me, ""you look so much healthier... I cant tell what it is but you just do."" I thanked her and moved on forgetting about Kratom. 

About a year later I was driving home from a friends house and noticed the old smoke shop. I remembered I needed cigarettes so I went in. I saw a big sign that said ""Kratom Sold Here"" I made the mistake of asking if they now sold them in capsules. They told me they always have. I decided to buy a bottle. For a couple of weeks I was just using the Kratom on the weekends to relax and have some energy. Then it slowly turned into something I needed on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday... ect.. I was hooked. I had to have a bottle on me at all times. It did not matter if it was storming or snowing or if I was an hour away I would go get it. I would buy 72 capsules for 43 dollars. I would go through a bottle within 2 days and was back at the smoke shop buying more. With Kratom you cannot just take one pill you have to take 6 or 7 per dose to get the effect you want. I was taking 8 pills at a time and re-upping every 2 hours or so. My finances became completely out of control. I stopped shopping for groceries and clothes or any normal necessities. This went on for two years. Kratom had a complete hold on my life. And I was in denial that I had a serious problem with it. 

After about two years I noticed my body started rejecting the Kratom. I would take the normal dose and I would shortly there after throw it up. I became scared and felt trapped in a corner because this had been my crutch for my depression and anxiety for two years. I decided I needed to go into treatment. 

The first thing I did was ask the nurse if he had even heard of Kratom. To my surprise he said, ""yes I have and I'm not a fan."" This was the first time I opened up to someone about my addiction to Kratom. Shortly after I saw a Psychiatrist who told me I must detox off the Kratom. He gave me a small dose of adderall to supplement the lack of energy and focus. The first day off of Kratom I felt fine. I thought this was going to be like last times detox. I would feel bad for a few days then I would return to normal. By the second day I was laying down with what felt like a fever, runny nose, headache, stiff joints, mood swings, aggression, and could only sleep about 2-3 hours It was probably the worst detox I had ever gone through (worse than herion). At the 72 hour mark I could not even leave my bed. I tried getting up once and I blacked out and ended up on the floor. I stayed in my bed for the weekend. I am now 7 days clean from Kratom and I encourage anyone reading this... if you are abusing Kratom...please get help. I had no idea what it was doing to body along with my mental health. If you have any questions please feel free to post and I will answer. 

Thank you,

At long last I was high. With 1mg of Klonopin and 30mg of hydrocodone I sat content and fully entertained.


The common room of the institution was a blank square room with a T.V., tables, and chairs. Sparse “inspirational” posters and drawings adorned the walls, in some effort to make it less depressing. There were always papers and pencils to draw with, and books of sudoku for the patients. But no matter how any of the staff tried it was still an institution.


Without any worries I let the opiates soothe my brain, washing over me like waves on a beach. Opiates make everything pleasant, the people around me felt like old friends, the room was alive, I was alive, and now I was happy. But I knew my clock was ticking…


Mira convinced me to play tic tac toe, so I came back to reality just enough to engage.


“So what brought you across the country?” she asked me, grinning after winning a match.


“Well it wasn't this place… I got in trouble back home and my parents agreed to help me out, a couple years back.” I replied not going into the details of my debauchery.


“What kind of trouble?” she probed raising an eyebrow.


“Drugs and money mostly, some crazy roommates didn't help either.”


I could tell she wanted to know more, but I wasn't about to tell my life story, so I kept it vague.


“What about you? Are you from here?”


“Well not originally, but I've been near the triangle for a while.” she replied.


Before I had the chance to ask more questions a nurse came in with two movies.


“Alright tonight it's The Other Guys or Pulp Fiction.” he said addressing everyone. 


Pulp Fiction was the unanimous winner to no surprise.


“Man movie nights, good food, and a hot new friend? This is a great place to be on a psych hold.” I thought to myself.


There was a strict no touching rule so I resorted to sitting close during the movie. 


As soon as the Heroin scene came on there was an abrupt change in the atmosphere of the room. People sat on the edge of chairs, discreetly rubbing their elbows. Even though I was already high. I found myself doing the same, with a one track mind, remembering the nirvana the movie could never showcase.


By the end of the movie Miras leg rested close to mine. “Maybe when we get out”, I thought, but it would have to wait. Lights out was in thirty minutes so everyone was headed to bed.


“It's good talking to you, another person like me” Mira said getting up to go to bed.


“Yeah it's nice to have company in a place like this. See you tomorrow?” I replied.


“ You can count on it.” She said with a smile, walking away.


In bed I couldn't sleep I was stuck thinking about getting high with Mira. Just a little Klonopin, some alcohol, and opiates or barbiturates for good measure. I knew it probably wouldn't happen but I still fell asleep to the thought.",1555977021.0

Context; Went to the hospital on 27th December from a Heroin overdose which was the wakeup call I needed to get clean, was in the whole deep addiction...

So, anyway, I recently got a new girlfriend. She is not an addict nor does she use opiates, however, she does use other drugs only really alcohol, ketamine, MDMA and weed. However, at the break of her last relationship she had never used drugs then started smoking weed and using MDMA and ketamine heavily to help get over the lad I imagine. 

Now, however, she only uses ketamine and alcohol rarely, but, does smoke weed every day and when she feels stressed or upset smokes weed (which to me as an ex-addict is worrying). She also uses MDMA fairly regularly, roughly once or twice a month. This worries me as I know it is incredibly neurotoxic and have had many friends turn into retards because of over-using it at a young age (she is only 19). 

If anyone could give me any good advice to try and stop her using MDMA and weed as regularly as she does that would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance, TheKugel.

Unless you have the financial resources to conceal your addiction, you are the scum of the world if you choose to consume opiates. 

Nevermind the Reality of the Situation; THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. Specifically our ninth amendment right to bodily autonomy and privacy (which are supported by the fourteenth amendment which stands mostly as a reconstruction amendment to support constitutional principles that are open to interpretation.) this is the objective truth and anyone who disagrees has been conditioned against their own interest. People will argue that in reality things like the commerce clause make the prohibition of opiates constitutionally viable, but that is false considering the prohibition of drugs has lead to immense levels of human suffrage which has only been exploited and turned into a massive for profit pyramid scheme hell bent on sending more humans into concentration centers where they will be forced into hard labor for doing nothing more than exercising their sovereign right to bodily autonomy.

Methadone clinics exist only because of the social additudes towards drug use and they are based upon nothing more than stigma, discrimination, judeao Christian ideals of morality and social conditioning for the benefit of the prison industrial complex. There is no valid reason that people who struggle with physical opioid dependence should all congregate to the same place almost every day, this medicine should be dispensed at a local pharmacy. I struggle with opioid dependence and I have no criminal history whatsoever, there is no reason I should be forced to go somewhere where a bunch of other struggling addicts, some of which actually are dangerous criminals, also congregate. Never mind the reality that some clinics are obviously clinics and anyone walking into a methadone clinic that isnt concealed is having their doctor patient confidentiality violated. Just because people like us choose to consume opiates instead of the disgusting legal alternative of alcohol doesn’t mean our rights should be trampled on.

It’s easy to see that when slavery ended a new form of slavery began to creep into our country, a silent form of slavery that has been imposed on all of us through fear and intimidation and most are too afraid to speak out because the only people who would advocate for “junkies” are other “junkies” (that word disgusts me by the way.)

Even the World Health Organization states that opioids should be easily accessible to treat chronic pain but unfortunately the war on drugs has created an environment where people fear their doctors. So instead of a doctor patient relationship built on trust and communication you have one built on fear and control and the patient is stuck walking on eggshells to ensure their doctor doesn’t flag them as an addict who is seeking drugs. The WHO also released a paper in July of 2017 stating that global drug (and sex work) prohibition needs to end to remove attitudes of discrimination from health care settings. 

But in America it seems we don’t listen to the advice of those who know better than us because that would be unpatriotic and un-American and wtf do those communist bastards know about drug addiction? (Rolls eyes)

Why has nobody had the balls to argue the constitutionality of drug prohibition within our system? Is our system that corrupt that anyone who stands up instigating this type of rhetoric is mowed down and stuck to rot in one of the many for profit prisons that benefit the wealthy who have continued enslaving our society even after slavery ended? Is there no legal counsel out there willing to stand up for the rights of the many for fear that they will loose their job/ standing as a legal professional?

Slavery was once a legally regulated industry and right now all the industries enforcing and regulating punitive measures against drug users are operating unconstitutionally and illegally. If a law is unjust you are not only right to disobey it, you are obligated to.",1555949616.0

Institutions are not nice places, they're a game. “yes” to this, “no” to that, and “sure I'll try blank medication”, always made for the quickest way out.


This time I was in a rehab and psych institution, about an hour away from Tar Heel central.


I ended up here because two days ago I made a fatal mistake. I told my therapist that suicide had been on my mind for a while. Even though the night before, my best friend asked me to be his best man. Therefore by my logic I had something to live for, and it wasn't an active thought anymore. My therapist disagreed, and I was immediately sent to the E.R. psych ward.


After 24 hours at the university hospital, the staff had reviewed my records. They probably  decided from my extensive history of visits, Oxy, Klonopin, and antipsychotic prescriptions to send me away. 


An hour after I was told I was being transferred a black, no nonsense looking, female, state trooper came through the only door.


“J SMITH!” she bellowed throughout the entire area.


Shaking, unsure, and in the beginnings of withdrawal, I stood and walked slowly over to her.


“Birthday?” she said calmer now, sensing I wasn't going to be a difficult patient.


“08/08/1994”


“Alright let's go then” she said taking my bag of personal possessions.


She held out open handcuffs, I compliantly placed my wrists inside. She mercifully didn't tighten them all the way, and we started walking to her cruiser. In the backseat I struggled with the handcuffs and seatbelt, as she sped down the freeway playing 2000's rap.


“Not the worst ride in a cop car” I thought to myself, as we zipped through traffic.


After arriving I waited to be released from the officers duty to the institutions care. After 15 minutes a nice man noticed me, while walking down a hallway.


“You ate?” He half mumbled, while handing me a lunch box.


“Great shitty, pre made, and reheated food”


I opened the box and to my surprise found chicken pasta, French bread, and a brownie.


“Huh… Maybe I won't hate this place”


After being fully signed in I was given most of my clothes back except my laces and hoodie pull cords. They provided me with my own box of hygiene supplies and showed me to my room. I was even told I could shave, provided there was a nurse watching.


My room was the usual long stay psych setup, minus a roommate which was ok with me. Two beds, two dressers, a bathroom with a curtain, and a camera.


I tried to make friends and act interested to show my inevitable psychiatrist I thought life was worth living. During free time I quickly found the junky kids like me. Eagerly we waited as lunch meds were dispensed by last name. 


I waited in the unofficial line, made up of six schedule 2 dependent patients. all waiting for their tiny afternoon fix. 


When my name was finally called I was given my old meds that they had on file, but I had no reason to complain. Two 7.5/500 Vicodin, 1mg Klonopin, and 800mg of Motrin sat in the little cup. Saving the Vicodin for last I cheeked both, and opened for a mouth check.Satisfied, the nurse sent me back to free time. I quickly made it to my room to retrieve and hide my pills in my suitcase.


Back in the recreation area during, a self harm strategies class, I found Mira. She was completely stoned out, after receiving no afternoon meds. She sat,her head leaned back, like she was a wall support. She was attractive gymnast type, but truthfully I wanted to know what had taken, not her number.


“Hey is it cool if I sit here?” I said sliding into the chair next to her.


“Sure.”


“I'm J”, introducing myself.


“Mira”, she blankly said.


“So why are you in here?” I cautiously probed.


“I tried to take myself out with a bottle of Klonopin. You?”


“Rubbing alcohol.” I replied.


Mira was obviously someone I wanted to get in with. A friend with a K-pin script, is a friend worth having. We sat together, in class I  made her laugh and tried to set myself up in the “drug zone”. That's where I wanted to be, after learning she didn't always take her scripts…


Throughout the next three hours there were classes on coping methods and rehab strategies. It was the usual experience just be chill, don't be friends with the crazys, cheek your meds from lunch to get high after dinner, and hang out with Mira.


By dinner time Mira was the closest thing I had to a friend in this place, we ate together as she told me about doing the ribbons in gymnastics. After I mentioned coming from California she was full of questions. Have you been to L.A.? How's the beach, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco?


I patiently answered her questions as thoughts of my evening dose began to invade my mind… I hadn't  had any opiates in weeks.


“Mmmmm… how sweet it will be…”


After dinner I constantly watched the clock, willing it to move to 7 for medication time. We watched the news, while drinking the decaf “coffee”, that was always available. 


As soon as the clock showed 7 the dispensing started. I cursed everyone who was ahead of me, constantly checking to make sure the Vicodin were still in my pocket. 


“Smith” an older nurse called out.


Almost jumping to attention, I made my way to the counter.


“Here you go Mr. Smith”, handing me my cup of antipsychotics, antidepressants, Klonopin and Vicodin. 


Her name tag said “Hellen”, god bless Helen…


“Thank you Hellen” I said after swallowing the pills in one mouth full.


Quickly I headed to my bathroom for some privacy and popped my stash.


“Now we wait” I muttered to myself as I walked back to the common room.",1555903792.0

I was just released from the hospital, for pancreatitis, I have a cyst on mine from drinking too much. I also went there for neck issues, found out I'm gonna need surgery within 6 months.



I usually self-medicate, don't we all, at home or on the street. My piss keeps coming up as a dilute for my PO. My ex said, "" just go through a doctor's scum, them you wont have to worry about Pissing dirty, you'll have scripts!"".



Not that easy, I found. So .... After a week of feeling like shit, I go in. They treat me like the drunkie I am, but not the human I am. They transfer me, again. I'm high, I talk shit about the nurse in my face lying about morphine, telling me she was giving me thorazal .... I'm in a better department.



After days of being on morphine, and hydro, then oxy.... After being released, and me coming to my somewhat home, I found out that my prescriptions were given to a place that I haven't lived it for 2 years, given that I've been homeless for two years and I told the hospital exactly where to release the prescriptions. So I called so many places, and I'm very nice and quiet. I get the rough end from so many chicks, and they're acting like I'm some sort of an ass-whole because their doctor screwed things up ... chewing things in my ear, pretending not to be themselves and taking down my information again. Well at that point, I wanted to talk to a manager, I really did. But I sat there and I waited for my drugs.

Before then, fentanyl was most often made by single, morally ambiguous chemists with access to high quality materials. This all changed when China got a taste of the money to be made. Around this time the Deep Web flourished and international connections were made exploiting any financial arbitrage. The few Chinese labs that made fentanyl were getting hit hard with orders and they realized the demand. More caught on and the government was slow to react as it was not a local drug problem for them and possibly as revenge for the opium wars. All kinds of savvy criminals saw the opportunity in importing fentanyl but they did not have the skills to dose it correctly, leading to 'hot-spots' and overdose deaths around the country. Organized crime took notice and realized that if it was dosed correctly, they could make a huge amount of money swapping expensive heroin supply chains to single electronics sized boxes coming from China. There was a period where they phased out heroin and phased in fentanyl. The problem was that the market responded negativly. People did not like the synthetic feeling of fentanyl, with its lack of euphoria and its tendency to cause breathing problems when that eurphoria was finally reached.
This was the turning point, the Manhattan Project of the drug war. They realized by mixing various synthetic opiates which now came in over 20 different types, they could mimick the short term rush combined with the long term pleasant high by very specifically combining synthetic opiates with different half-lives. Now the market made the switch, people who thought they were doing heroin were actually doing a mixture of fentanyl analoges and other synthetic opiates. The dosing process was perfected and what used to take a small country full of poppy fields could now be shipped into critical markets in a shoebox. That is the first nuclear level problem, the Chinese were making metric tons of fentanyl with no blowback and import could not be stopped. A single drug mule swallowing balloons could import enough to feed an entire metropolitans city for a day or two.
This is around the time I quit and got on Suboxone therapy, when it was just plain fentanyl replacing the heroin I would get annoyed with the boring rush and the side effects, having a 50/50 chance of scoring my drug of choice or a cheap, boring replacement. This brought the cost down to where organized crime became interested in the previously very expensive heroin market, with a dose of synthetic opiates costing orders of magnitudes less the higher up in the supply chain it was purchased.",1555855585.0

From what I read on the NHS website, I have 3 options methadone, bupe/subs or rehab. Rehab isn’t an option.


I’m really just looking for first hand experiences of how the doctor decides what would best suit you, also am I likely to get any medication to help with things like sleep? 

Lastly I have a rather silly embarrassing question but hope somebody here can at least relate even if they don’t have an answer. Will I be able to get high on these meds? 
I have this crippling fear that I’m not going to be “high” anymore. I’m not gonna be able to coast through this like I do life by just wrapping my consciousness up in an opiated bubble. And that scares me. I’ve done it for so long. I understand I won’t be sick but will I get the mental relief? I don’t mean nodding out kinda high I just mean high enough for me to be comfortable with daily living, or does maintenance not work like that?

I’m a 24 year old girl, had a habit on and off for a few years. Last time I was clean was like 8 or 9 months ago. Anyways I’ve been taking like 4-6 or sometimes like 8 blue 30’s a day. Really whatever I can get my hands on I’ll take lol. I used to take real ones but for the last few months I’ve been snorting fake ones because they’re stronger. Probably fent in them, the guy who sells them to me swears it isn’t but I doubt it. Anyways I’m not going to have any money for the next week, Maybe longer due to some unforeseen shit circumstance and I only have $100 left then that’s it, this girl (me) is so fucked lol, so looks like I’m detoxing. I can either:
A: get about 5-6 more of these fake ones and stretch them out as long as possible then I have a pretty much unlimited supply of subutex to take once I run out and take those for a few days and try to ween off
Or
B: get about 10 10mg methadone pills and try taking those? I took like 7 at a time a few weeks ago and only they seemed to only work for 12 -15hours and I was hurtin again so I’m nervous to do this because what if I fuck myself and only get one good dose?

The reason I’m scared of option A is because Ive taken subs twice now and each gone into PWD. Worst. Experience. Ever. The only thing that got me out was taking more fake ones and I had to go thru hell for like 6 hours. But It’s subutex not suboxone and yes I know it’s the bupe not nalaxone that makes you sick. I’m just so afraid to take it again. I waited like 12 hours last time I guess that wasn’t enough. It works fine when my friends do it thats why idk why it won’t work for me.

After all the shit, sweat, nightmares and tears I finally got clean. I was able to welcome my sister home from school with a pretty set of eyes rather than the glossed void leading to anything but me.

She was here for one day before I got in touch with the middle man, who struggles just like I do. He got me what I wanted because he knew I felt shitty but this was the first time he told me that he respected me because I was the only one in the game that never gave him shit. Never gave him hell for getting arrested with my money. Never asked him to hurry up. Never asked to replace the funds he lost. He told me it hurt him bad each and every time he scored for me.

I have this burning, aching love for each and every soul on this earth that suffers the game of life. I respect everyone for the fight that goes on for each and every one of us. I snuck out my window in bare feet to retrieve the cure from down the road after it was dropped near my home. Stepping in puddles and tripping without a damn care. Upon sneaking in I heard the dog move in my mothers’ room, so I stuck the dope under the bed and began watching videos.

Waited thirty minutes until I finally decided it was the appropriate time to feel better. This was the first time I spent someone else’s money. I made sure all was quiet in the home and racked it up. I took it...

I just started fucking crying. I have everything in the world going for me still even after a few months of active addiction. Scholarships to university after years of struggle in community college engineering programs. I have the most beautiful and loving family that transcends what words can say.

Here I am. High as a kite. Alone in a dark room just as I had planned.

And now, for the first time in my entire life, after all the detoxes and probations and death...

I realized just how sad I am.

I truly, undoubtedly love you all so much.

I make no claim to being special, each and every one of us deserves the chance to make a difference in this world. I would die if it meant getting just one addict clean.

But I am the addict. I am the one that is willing to suffer to change the world, and I cannot even allow myself that.",1555813800.0

I'm a 26-year-old living with my parents for the next 6 months due to weird circumstances with my previous roommates. They (my family) know I use, so they forced me to close my previous bank account and transfer it over to a joint bank account so they can monitor my activity. I'm fortunate enough to make a lot of money for my age, but taking out cash is painfully obvious. Even if I go to a grocery store and get cash they'll know because I don't otherwise spend $100+ dollars at Target.. Unfortunately, my tolerance is at the point where I need at least 120mg of oxy to catch a buzz. They do not drug test me, but that really doesn't make a difference if they can see what I'm doing with my money. It's super embarrassing considering I'm a college graduate with a good career that I've worked hard for. I shouldn't be dealing with this shit from my parents who make maybe half what I do.

I grab what I came for, and begin to turn around, and start the walk back-home direction till I get to my source, while calling since the night before to prevent a mishap in my pick up....  and then continue the walk home pit-stopping only once, @ the Quickie. That's where I make sure to stock-up on certain things in case I blow my cheque before I get to see this white rabbit again. 2x Pack of smokes, Lighter, Visine, pizza pops, noodles, pop, Aloe Vera (regular kind), Miss Vickies Chips, and if I feel like splurging I might grab some smart water - while laughing that this stuff don't make you smart, except it just might maybee.

On the odd month, I like add a XL Slushy to my order, and fumble around for extra change for it - but while I already filled it... and I already got what I came in for. **The guy at the Quicky will usually say:** *""Don't worry about it bro.. - have a good day"".*

I hear a punjabi voice : ""**excuse me sir ... sir! - you drop something"" .**    Now I knew it couldn't have been my *inner-voice ,* because my inner-voice is redneck as ph\*ck.   I stop dead in my track, as I acknowledge him slightly with a thank you before I notice what it is. (*all without making eye contact)....* I look down, and there it was: a one off, of my long tips in the wrapper + blue rubber tourniquet wrapped'round that just happen to fumble it's way out.

I felt ashamed, embarrassed. I felt like the crackhead/junkie that my mother calls me every chance she gets - clean or not.

At my peak I was taking 500mg of tramadol a day, for about 7 months, luckily I never had a seizure, even though I often mixed the 500mg with 2mg of xanax. During this time being I felt wonderful since I always had my ways around with scripts so I had an endless supply of pills.

Nevertheless I had to taper off the pills for various reason and it's been one week since I popped some tramadol, and needless to say I feel horrible. The physical WD's were horrible for about 3 days then it went away but the psychological WD's are killing me. I'm always hanging out with friends and smoking mad weed to distract myself but I always end up craving this wonderful feeling that is the warmth of Tramadol.

I know methadone usually doesn't hit you til the 3rd or 4th day, but I'll be alright, just felt like telling my situation to someone si ce my parents dont give a fuck about my health when it comes to my pain manahement/addiction problem, they think I can just quit at any time, which I could, but I've been doing opiates for ten years now, and its just a part of me now, and I'll be taking a low dose of the subs, like a half yo a whole one a day, which to some is a lot, and sell some of what I save for extra cash. Methadone helped me physically more than subs. But the mental side was about the same with both, I was under a grant that pays for me to go to the clinic and it ends on April 30th, but I'm stopping on the 29th to make sure the discharge papers get to the sub doc in time bc I cant get a script without discharge papers from the done clinic. At least that's what they were saying, they didn't want me to seem like I was doctor shopping if any officials were to look in on their records and stuff, so I understand. Just ready to get back on subs and start losing weight, I gained 25 pounds on methadone, and wish I would have just stayed on subs, it's easy to put on weight, but hard af to get it off lol I've gotten comfortable with my weight though, used to be self conscious about it last time I was on done, had stretch Mark's and everything, but now it doesn't bother me at all, I just look husky/stocky now, but anyways just needed to free my mind with what's going on with my situation, happy nods peeps.",1555774187.0

A research article on the drug Tianeptine. It states that the behavioral effects of the antidepressant requires the mu-opioid receptor.,"I have used tianeptine recreationally and was not prescribed it from a doctor, a version of it was sold as a “dietary supplement” in gas stations throughout the southeast. It had great antidepressant effects and I believe this was mostly due to the fact that it’s a full agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Could this change the way we view opioids/opiates in the treatment of depression?
*Edit*: It does claim tianeptine does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal and I disagree with that statement because I have experienced the hellish withdrawals from continued use of this drug.

Damn. So another dreadful week. God I hate this. I took 3 bars last night and it knocked me out. I woke up withdrawing without the effect of bars. No more bars for me by the way. I took 12mg loperamide last night and I'm still shitting my self. Darn. My dope was fentanyl so man are the withdrawals bad and intense. I hate this shit. I asked family friend if they could front me some subs (got his refill recently) to I can break since I'm ready. I'm not gonna wait for the methadone clinic and IM ALSO NOT GONNA ENROLL ON THE METHADONE CLINIC EITHER IM GONNA COLD TURKY AND GET CLEAN THAT WAY FROM HEROIN/FENT since tragedy struck my family.  a close relative just passed away and his child is now depending on me so I have to get my act clean to help take care of her, and to get a job to buy her stuff and take her out. I'm done with this life. Even tho I'm sick as fuck and a friend who in town just swinged by with pure fent and pure heroin I had to rejected, I'VE NEVER DONE THAT EVER IN MY LIFE even though I'm in full blown withdrawals. I even surprised myself. Fuck dope my family need me right now. Time to step up.

BY THE WAY 2ND DAY OF WITHDRAWALS!!!! FUCKKKKK.. BUT IM GONNA DO THIS WHETHER I GET FRONTED THE SUBS OR NOT!! MAN CANNOT REMAKE HIMSELF WITHOUT SUFFERING FOR HE IS BOTH THE MARBLE AND SCULPTURE.

UPDATE: I WILL NOT BE ENROLLING IN THE METHADONE PROGRAM. I AM COLDTURKEYING HEROIN/FENT RIGHT NOW. I WISH I COULD GET MY HANDS ON A SUBOXONE RIGHT NOW FOR THE 2-3 days of withdrawals but I can't :(

So she is perfect for me but my chemistry towards her is gone as soon as I'm clean, back I had other health and family issues and she was with me at 100%, but after some time I was so tired she understood and gave me some time, in that moment I realized she was getting addicted to me under the opiates ( I'm more kind, more easy going, positive and charm).

Lately my family is having not issues but we are tryin to build things again and when I'm with them I just have to be clean, I'm rly young so withdrawals are not bad as I heard, so when I'm with the fam I ignore her sometimes I dissapear a week without telling her while sober, she just knows I'm alive because I bet she text my mom, but I'm deeply sorry, sometimes when I feel I tell her I'm busy and I will text or be with her later but the thing is opiates made my chemistry towards her 0

And yes I did rail some lines. But if I look in the mirror I look ok. I think I dont look as bad as I was when I was using heavily, I just look tired and have rings under my eyes. I also look like I didnt sleep much which I do. Do you guys got any tipps and tricks on how to look better? I know that I could sleep more but I got sleeping problems and she does know that I dont sleep much. I would really appreciate some tipps on how to look healthier. The bad thing is that she saw me nodding a few days ago. And since then she suspects that I relapsed again. Even if she wont recognize my next wds cause I got about 70 Xanax 2mg left for my next wd. So thats easy going. But she just dont believes me that I dont use. Even if she dont see's me using in any way. Maybe because I lied so often to her. IDK how long I am still allowed to live with my family in a house. Then I have to get my own Apartment. But thats anotger story. How do you guys hide your addiction from your family? I still want to live togetger with them. I need them. They dont support me with money. Just with much love. And I dont want to keep hurting them. But I also dont want to move out, I even cant afford to move out cause I currently dont got a job, I finished my apprenticeship 2 months ago but dont wanted to keep working in that company cause it was a shitty one. And because of my addiction I had many sick days, which get paid in my country. So currently I am searching for a new job. Sorry I got off track. So the question is how do you hide from your family that you use drugs? I can hide my H use perfectly if I dont nod, but if I use benzos, which I nearly do everyday you can see a bit that I am on some shite. Man that sucks so much. I feel so guilty for lying at my family. So thanks in advance for any tipps and tricks.",1555760870.0

Usually i just take 400mg at once would it be better to space out  by taking 200mg then take another 200mg 30 mins/ 1 hr later?

**q2)** I keep reading different advice regrading using promethazine, (to boost high) so say take 100mg  others say take 25mg ??

If you take to much just dulls the codeine high?
