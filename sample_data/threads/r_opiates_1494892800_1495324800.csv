How fucked am I? Questions..","Hey guys I did something stupid, maybe?

I am scheduled to take my first Vivitol shot in a few hours. But I did 5-6 shots of heroin yesterday. Before that I was clean for 3+ weeks. So I only have one days worth of heroin in my system. Basically I quit a few weeks ahead of time like I was supposed to. But when 'the day before the shot' came I basically panicked and decided I wanted to get high one last time. I did around .3ish if I had to guess. Also, I don't know if this is relevant but I am 98% sure that what I did yesterday was Fentanyl. I don't know if that means anything in regards to half-life, etc. 

So is that going to be an issue? I know all about precipitated withdrawal, but my understanding was that it would only put you in WD if you were going to WD in the first place if you had stopped taking Opiates then, and that it basically just condensed your 5-6 days of WD in to a hellish 6-12 hours. 

So since I wouldn't come anywhere close to withdrawing in a vacuum based off of the few shots I did yesterday I figured that it wouldn't be that big of a deal. And that basically anything I had in my system that was still making me feel well would be gone, but that I wouldn't go into full fledged WD either. 

How accurate was my take on it? Will I be fine, or did I really fuck up and it's going to hit me like a bus running me over at 100mph?

My heart is racing, I hear it pounding in my head, pulsing in my trembling fingertips.  

The cold sweat drips down my neck and back as I shiver and sniffle pathetically, curling into a ball and whimpering as another wave of ""fuck you god just kill me already"" washes over me, my gut cramps and spasms as I try not to shit myself or puke up the beer.
At some point I lash out at the wall denting the aluminium with a perfect bloody imprint of my knuckles.   

As the wave subsides I slowly drag myself back into an upright position, rocking back and forth, knees pulled tightly to my chest.  I crack another beer as the ringing in my ears fades away and I hear the happy trumpets of ""self destructive anthem""  playing in the background, a sardonic half smile passes my lips so fast anyone watching would have missed it.
    
I feel the valium starting to kick in and take what feels like my first full breath in hours.   I make my way to the bathroom on shaky legs doubled over with one hand on the wall for support.  After what seems like an eternity I make it back to my bed, I start to drift off but snap awake shaking and twitching.  

I sit back up finish my beer and check my phone.  No texts back still, not that I expected any, ""what are friends for"" I say out loud?

Well everyone was saying that on AVERAGE street stuff should equal out to a G only being as strong as 400mg of oxycodone, if you're lucky! Well since im a harm reduction person ive been waaaay to worried to do more than a tiiiiiny bit of this stuff every 4 hours or so. I figured thag with my tolerence tho i would need half the G Monday and the other tuesday. Well i thought i was down to about 3 of the sozed lines i was doing in bag one but when i dumped it out there was enough for like 15 lol so waaay more than i thought but that means ive probably only done .25 of the g and have not been sick at all and actually just slept 4 hrs and woke up feeling 100%. But in theory snorting this amount should omly have been 100 to 150mg of oxycodone TOPS spaced oit in timy amounts from 12pm till now and that amount spaced out over the same amount of time of my oxycodone def wouldnt have had me feeling perfectly fine and sleeping well.....

Most said mg for mg snorted would be 1 to 1 with oxycodone if the stuff was pure which its onviously not so 1000mg at even 50% would be 500mg oxy equivalent meaning i only did 125mg'ish equivalent so far over 15 hrs? And im gueasing the 50% is probably a stretch even though ""fire"" was used a few times about this stuff but isnt everyone called that at the time lol....

Its also odd that morphine last month did nothing for me no matter how i took it but i might be able to make .5 last 2 full days easily at this point.

Not what i expected when doing conversion #s is all im saying and i guess trying to figure out why i got these results so far when nothing else seems to work without massive amounts....are my numbers just way off or am i just processing this better than everything else?

Want to go to rehab,"I finally found a reputable rehab that will take me in without insurance. Have always wanted to go to rehab and should have gone years ago, but have never been able to go to one until now. However, must be fully detoxed before rehab will admit me. Is there any way to taper off of a 2 week BTH stent, using about  a .75 to a full 1.0g/day? Have a very strong tolerance to subs and binge was only 2 weeks long. Want to try and do this as pain-free as possible with maybe only slight w/d. Yes, if this was first time, 2 weeks would be no biggie. However, been doing this back and forth from bth to subs for a such a long time now, body can't handle it like it used to. After only a few days usage, will feel w/ds. For first time in a while, before this last relapse was off subs and bth for a week and was okay 👌 after the 7th day of nothing. Then like a typical addict, some bad stuff happened in life and also thought I deserved to treat myself after going a week without OPs. 

Currently, have about a 1.2g.of bth and a few subs. Recommendations as to best way to do this as little discomfort as possible. Never tried it before, but thinking of maybe only using a point of BTH when w/d starts to get a little gnarly and just stretching that out for a couple of days and then maybe using sub for a day or two after that? As I know we all do, I absolutey dread w/d. Mental more than anything. I'll admit it, mentally like a child during w/d. Physical i can handle, it's the mental. Oh, also have maybe a dozen clonidine and a dozen xans, plus seroquel for sleep. Of course some MMJ. Would really appreciate input what you guys think the best method of doing this with the least amount of discomfort possible with the supplies that are available. 

P.S. - Please no condescending remarks or insults. I know this probably won't be the last time this happens and I shouldn't be here in the first place... I know, believe me. It's retarded, but it is what it is. I am a slave to opiates and it fuckin sucks. BTH is the freaking worst though and just sucks my freakin soul up into a black hole and I really want out.

For the first time, found a rehab that will take me in without insurance, but I must be fully detoxed and off everything before I can start. I have always wanted to go to rehab but have never been able to until right now. I really want this guys and yes I may and probably will fail at some point, but I'm trying the best I can. So please be supportive and help me get thru this rather than criticizing please. Thank you very much in advance. 

Update: I caved and wound up buying more... Now up to a little more than a gram a day. Think I'm a little over 3 weeks in... I want out sooooo badly, but I am truthfully absolutely terrified of the withdrawals... Fuck! Still have the same supplies, actually now have about 2 Gs of Bth..... How can I do this as painlessly as possible? If I had access to like 5 days worth of methadone, I feel like this could be much less painful because I wouldn't have to wait to be in W/D before taking the dones. Unfortunately do not have any dones and definitely not trying to sign up for one of those clinics that makes me come in every morning for my dose. I wish I knew of a doc that could prescribe dones... 

Anyways, how should I do this guys with the LEAST amount of discomfort possible? W/D terrify me and will definitely be feeling them at this point... ",1494916045.0

My hands shake all day and my skin is super sensitive, but that started a day after my last methadone dose.   


It's been 10 days since my last dose of methadone, I started taking 5mg Valium daily about 7 days ago reduced it to 2.5mg 4 days ago. Didn't take any yesterday (might have skipped another day in there somewhere).     I also drink between 4-8 standard drinks every night depending on how shitty the day was.    


Any one have any insight to share?  Is this normal?   I've never done a slow taper from methadone before.  Last time was a forced thing in jail.  The experience is so much more subtle this time its hard to compare the 2 in my mind. 


Some background info.   

I was on methadone for 4 years and heroin for about 6 before that. I very slowly tapered off methadone all the way down to 1mg before I jumped off.

I usually drink too much for a month or 2 then quit for a few months and start all over again. Never had any problems when stopping before.  

I've been prescribed high dose long acting benzos (20mg Valium 6mg klonopin daily) long term before, I never had any W/D symptoms until after a little under a month of taking them daily.

My boyfriend and I have been opiate enthusiasts for a while now. He alot longer than I, but regardless we haven't been without some kind of something more than a few days here and there in the last almost 2 years. We usually stick oxy, hydros, subs when we can't find anything else and occasionally 420, but for the last several months we've our DOC has been the fake mbox30s fent pills. (And yes I'm aware of the dangers, and yes we use them as cautiously as we possibly can. Never taking more than a 1/8th at a time and have always bought them from the same dboy and they've been consistently dosed every single time and we've easily done 100s of them in the last few months. He has always been upfront with us about what we were buying and to use caution. He uses them daily himself and always tries the batch before he sells them to anybody. He is very trust worthy and spends the night on our couch since we live closer to where he reups.) Anyways we've been kind of broke here lately and just moved to a new city about an hour away from home, which hasn't stopped us from driving an hour one way to get our fix almost every day. We had already gotten some of the mbox30s and we're still bored out of our minds but didn't want to drop the $70 to get us each one more. Bf ended up talking to someone around here that had Crystal and H. We got some Crystal and tried it, both first timers for that, it was fun I guess but not something that appeals to me because we both prefer downers rather than uppers. Might try it again one day if we get bored enough but not something were dying to get more of. Not to mention i couldn't sleep for 4 days ahaha. The next day the guy said he had some white boy, which is a rare find around here...usually can only find tar. Keep in mind we don't do H regularly and we sniff everything. This was my very first time trying ""H"" and he has only sniffed it a handful of times back when he lived in NY. When he got it from the guy he noticed it looked weird as fuck, me not having any experience with it didn't know what it was supposed to look like. He bought it anyways because it was better than having nothing and all we could afford that day. This stuff wasn't powder at all, it was like offwhite and flat and hard and stuck together like cakey almost, and he said even though he's  only done H a few times he's never had any that even slightly  resembles what he has ever seen before. We crushed it up as best we could, but it was still stuck in flat chunks and we just sniffed it like that because it just wasn't gonna break up. It had the vinegar smell which he said was normal, but I don't think it really did anything, definitely nothing even close to a nod. Maybe a little bit of double vision, and mostly just feeling like I couldn't breathe which was mostly me from me freaking myself out, because we didn't really know what we did. He was perfectly fine and still felt withdrawals. The only things I felt were left overs from sniffing the last of the crystal an hour or two before and stuff that was mostly in my head. Like I said neither of us are very knowledgeable when it comes to H. We both prefer pills. Does anybody have any idea what the guy sold us? I tried looking it up and the only thing I could find was that it may have been due to humidity...if it was just that wouldn't we have felt atleast a little something from it? Or was it something else entirely? I only did half of my share and threw the rest away just because I wasn't gonna do more of something that didn't do anything but make me feel super paranoid and was a mystery substance. Anybody know? Like I said neither of us mess with H at all really so we have no clue. Think we will just stick to our pills for a good while . 😂",1494883172.0

So I'm 22 years old and have been using opiates since 16, first years (dihydro)codeine and then with 18/19 I switched to methadone because codeine was hardly available OTC anymore. 
I've used around 1-3 times per week, but often did breaks from 2-8 weeks to stay in control and keep tolerance down.
Now over the last 6-12 months I've began using more often (3/4 times each week) and doing less breaks. 
I took the last dose of methadone (100mg) last sunday and haven't taken anything since.
I don't sleep too good really, but that aside I don't really have the typical withdrawal symptoms, except for sneezing a lot and light shivering. 

I plan on doing a break of at least 2-3 weeks (in my experience my tolerance is quite low after 2 weeks, although I've never had a tolerance as high as 100mg methadone. 

I've began to wonder if at this time I am still capable of controlled use, both physically and psychologically. 

What do you guys think, if I return to consuming once per week, will I get symptoms like sleeplessness and feeling uncomfortable in general again, or will this be enough to not get physically addicted?
And do you guys think that at this point consuming only once per week is even possible without doing it more often at some point in the near future?

6boko2,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6boko2/its_time/,11,https://redd.it/6boko2,Garterren,It's time,"I just commented this on some r/pics/ post but I wanted someone who would understand to read it.  I love you all and I frequent this sub on a different account. 

I first came here before I started my habit and I was amazed how smart, well spoken, and self-aware people were.  It was silly to judge people by their habits but I know now that's what society made me think.  I thought users were ""junkies"" and didn't deserve any better.  I'm deeply sorry.  I can honestly say you're the best people I've come across.  Even though we've never met, reading your comments has made me feel a connection like never before.

I've been taking pills for too long. Started with hydrocodone, moved to oxy and everything between. Up to a couple weeks ago I was spending a fortune a day just to get through. It made me feel so... well, you know.

When I started justifying heroin to myself to save money, I had a pretty deep moment of realization and I knew it was time. I've never had issues with drugs. I've done almost everything out there, including Xanax and cocaine, and never felt a pull so strong. 

I'm currently tapering off. It's not my first attempt but I'm more serious this time than ever. I'm down to 1/10 or less of what I used to take a day and I'm going to stop it entirely soon and move to kratom. I feel like shit all the time, I cry for no reason, I'm congested and everything hurts but I'm okay. I know I will be okay. I don't know how I'll ever fill the time but I know I was able to do it somehow in the past. 

People say tapering often leads to people prolonging and justyfing their use. They say a loved one should hand out the medicine because no one person can do it themselves. Well, no one knows about my habit. It was hard to hide but it's even harder to hide the withdrawal. I can't tell anyone now. I made the decision to start and to quit myself- I'm too far in to confess.

I distinctly remember when I first started... I didn't feel any effect the first time I took hydrocodone. I googled it and found others had the same issue. One comment in particular stands out now: ""Take it as a sign from the universe. Turn around now and never look back. You might not believe me but you'll be better off for it."". 

I now know I would've been. I will get through this and I will be stronger for it. People have gone through much worse.  

I will keep coming back here and this community will always be my friend.  I honestly wish every one of you all the best. I'm tearing up writing this but finally I have a good reason.",1495026548.0

6bnbyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6bnbyu/its_like_were_all_drowning_and_no_one_gets_it/,31,https://redd.it/6bnbyu,DefaultDrugExpert,It's like we're all drowning and no one gets it,"Warning, long, tl;dr at the bottom:

It is understood to just be part of human nature where a drowning individual latches onto any physical object within reach. Oftentimes, they irrationally grab onto those attempting their rescue, ultimately resulting in two bodies slowly bobbing face down rather than one. This characteristic exists as one of those ideas not talked about strongly negatively in swim rescue theory but more matter-of-fact as merely a property of a panicked over-evolved primate’s lizard brain reacting poorly to an overindulgence of water and first grasp of the fragility of its own mortality.

When rescuing, a floating device is strongly recommended for the rescuer; With none available, employing methods escalating as far as punching the drownee in the head as a response to panicky behavior (near-universal among humans if I may remind you) compelling the drowning party’s counter-intuitive death grip.
And yet, when it comes to the plight of the addict…when they too are drowning and would grab on to anything containing the slightest potential possibility of alleviating the impending mix of doom and pain that the ensuing physical & chemical crash brings,  while society turns its back. They only see the visual too. In addition to the crashing and/or withdrawing addict’s overt symptoms, a totally out of whack neurotransmitter system desperately craves a fix of some particular needed substance(s), 
An Exceptionally Brief Snapshot Behind the Scenes within the Brain,  e.g. – 

Methamphetamine: Your withdrawing body, the complete inverse of energy and happiness, strongly lusts after the excessive dopamine rush, release, and buildup as well as a solid hit of serotonin both of which neurotransmitters synergized to provide that excessive, superhuman ego, incredible thoughts, strength, & reflexes, as well as most curiously, a genuine interest and enjoyment in all things you haven’t felt since…now reduced to utter lethargy, boredom, and pain: paying down the debts of your high with lowness you hadn’t conceived of.
Note: good for knockback nootropic highs back into speed at low doses


Heroin users (to some extent all opioid users): We feel the most profound sense that nothing is right and life is misery while we crave any sort of method to feel warm, comfortable, and at peace again. All due to opioids no longer being there to mimic a fuckload of our endorphins for our natural mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors to bind with and shoot jolts of contentness throughout every fiber of our body while we turn into a blanket, and if lucky, fall into a half awake dream state known as the nod, where you have a varying scale over your hallucinations and interact in the most bizarre way. Then it all fade, and you get a nice dose of “oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck. I don’t know what’s bad, but somethings bad. Somethings gotta be wrong. I don’t feel right. Shit shit shit shit.” It’s some of the worst pain and physical effects during as well. Make you want to hurt yourself to release endorphins if you’re dose has been high enough.. Gives you the flu times 100 mixed in with some existential restructuring per the countless straight hours of hating yourself and everything leading to an apparent sickness that can only be thought of as a plague of some sort when in full swing. 




People get scared. I doubt anyone hasn’t imagined themselves drowning. Sometimes it’s no one’s fault, other times malicious intent, sometimes it’s your own stupidity, sometimes, you just want it that way and you don’t know why...


But people understand, sympathize, and accept this part of human nature and aim to keep life-saving from being necessary but grasp the (sometimes inflated) hoops you need to jump through to rescue a drowning victim while thinking about yourself and not pushing the drown victim deeper into panic and the water. To save the misguided swimmers, Rescuers share a buoy or even temporarily strike to prevent latching. Other times, rescuers have no choice but to escape the thrash of the panicked mammal and flee, swimming downwards so the water-logged fool doesn’t follow and kill you both. Get out of their life temporarily because it’s not worth going down with someone who’s given up or toxic, no matter your intentions and abilities (Sudden analogy switch I know, but I need you to understand. Experience and what I’ve seen have taught me not every addict can be saved).


Have you ever felt pure existential doom? The absolute, undeniable omnipresent emotion that repeatedly screams “This will all end as poorly as possible and nothing in all of existence is right at all!” It’s not an impression that leaves you easily. People will try anything to get out of this dependence from their ultimate high, tool, and/or cure, (which it is depends on usage and philosophy there are by far more categories). These suffering souls need some sort of buoy that works for them, be it a tight nit social group, enough hobbies to keep life in check, a good job. Anything that supports them into not needing to escape since that’s the real core issue. It’s not all puppies and rainbows…some lives are just fucked up and maybe best on opiates or maybe even be dead (I hate to think of the backlash this will get me). That is a very small subset of people. When you initially halt chemically escaping, it comes back tenfold on you: panic in a real world setting rather than in a bizarre well-hydrated (tongue in cheek) piece of nature ready for a drowning. Either of these are ridiculous situations to be in emotionally, physically and mentally (to some extent spiritually). Of course, a metaphorical buoy is needed and sometimes you just gotta swim down fast n’ hard and cut that person out of your life for a bit (mere moments in rescuing before returning, who knows with life?). The best buoy in my life has been consistent interface with society and networks of people who care about me.


The parallels between drowning in your usage and drowning in water are clear, however I will later outline for the sake of the dense. Why don’t we sympathize with the addict? We scorn them as someone who did this to themselves, who crossed an uncrossable line, who aren’t worth it, who lack a long time to live, who belong in prison, who should certainly stop immediately, who needs help, who knows they’re playing Russian roulette every time they open a bag with the potential cut of fentanyl but both have to and are willing to play those odds. How many of these cutting, hateful sentiments can be re-projected onto a downing person? What if they swam into a rip-tide with a warning sign? Tried to drown themselves? Cramped up all of a sudden and starts drowning due to an injury that is in no part their problem (I relate this to the many who found themselves addicted to heroin as a cheap, available alternative after developing medical conditions that resulted in increased opioid prescriptions and the eventual sharp lessening of prescriptions by order of the Drug Enforcement Administration).
The war on drugs has seriously fucked up this druggy beach. They ripped down signs warning about different areas. Their line of sight is limited, but they pull anyone out of the water (shoreline or center of the ocean) and toss them into cages. Many drown in the center of the water hiding from these government cogs. Many drown just because of what the world thinks of them all due to rumors started by the anti-drug soldiers that eventually entered social norm. Something must change socially and it’s beginning with pot, escalating with mdma for ptsd, and we’ll soon see acid and shrooms for end of life care along with shrooms treating cluster (suicide headaches).

I hate that this has gone on as long as it has. Let’s work where we can to add happiness, peace, and joy naturally and use drugs like the tools they are. Let’s give out more buoys, put out more signs, get rid of the old way of running the beach. People are still getting in the water, we can teach them how to do it safely and help those who need to escape get onto land. This war against information has taken too many lives already and forces countless others to live in fear. We’re winning, but we’re winning slowly while men, women, and children die from the negligence of our forefathers. 

tl;dr I'll give you a tldr but I'm gonna berate you a bit first. You know how difficult it was to write that currently weaning down the dope and ice and feeling the benzos hard. Fuck you, read my words.....(I'm kidding, we all busy people).

Actual tldr: generic anti-war on drugs speech but cool analogy. society sees nothing wrong with a panicked drowning person grab onto anything near them and generally dont blame them. Yet the addict in the exact same spot/worse is looked down on. That's bullshit. We deserve flotation devices (whether that means more dope, a support unit or something) too though sometimes also need to just get smacked in the head so someone can save us.

I'm working on getting my experiences transitioning from a devout Mormon to a recreational drug enthusiast put into words. This was something I threw together while high, but I've always been a decent writer and if anyone has any suggestions about writing for audiences, PM me.

It was supposed to be china white. The substance was off-white, sticky, and almost wet. I was withdrawing so I somehow was able to do 3 key bumps without it falling off the key. i instantly knew something was wrong when it felt like weed sorta. I had crazy dry mouth and felt ""off"". It was horrible and I wanted out. So I go home and try to sleep it off, but when I woke up, lo and behold, I felt the same shitty way.

Friday night the wife and I had a baby sitter for our two hell raising children for the first time in months. We chose to eat good and come home and get super freaky since we had the house to ourself, finally. 

On the way home from Outback steakhouse, I'm pulling onto my street, pretty quickly i have to add, and zoom right passed a guy who looked to be a sleep at the steering wheel with the car running about to pull off my street. I'm sure you can already guess where this is going. I zoomed past him about 100 feet or so before i stopped and looked at my wife and says ""did you see that guy?""

She says no what guy? I stayed in that spot for a few seconds and looked in my rear view mirror at the car that wasn't moving. Turned to my wife and said "" that nigga dead.""

So after waiting a minute, i pull my car in reverse up to the side of his car. His Window is down, so i roll mine Down and sure enuff the guy is a sleep at the wheel. I yell across thru his Window, honk my horn trying to wake him and nothing. So i park my car and run up to his window again, this time on foot. I go to reach my hand through the Window to shake his shoulder a bit and try to wake him. Then i see it. Needle in his arm and spoon on the middle console.

Fuck. I tried to wake him for another minute or two. My wife is kind of getting sick after seeing the needle and knowing that her husband is one of these people she starts crying. Fuck. I have to call it in.

I really didn't know what else to do. 

They told me i did the right thing. I know after the narcan and hospital visit he waa going to jail though. That's how it is here. You leave the hospital and go straight to jail. 

I keep feeling like he may have woken up eventually without the narcan. I keep telling myself that i got this guy in trouble and I'm a snitch. I despise snitches and cop calling fucks. I feel like a shit bag ass snitch for this. Maybe he wanted to die, who knows?

6bl1d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6bl1d9/well_this_sucks/,18,https://redd.it/6bl1d9,techyy,"Well, this sucks...","    So I've been clean all of 2017. I had a few relapses last year, but I started on this road to recovery back in 2014 when I met my husband. He's fully aware all my addiction, he's never touched a drug in his life but he does his best to understand. I'm currently tapering of of Suboxone, down to 1 MG a day!

     Anyway, we've decided that we wanted to have children in the next year or maybe longer depending where I'm at in a few months. I have PTSD, I was raped in 2009 and I never really dealt with it and then numbed my feelings with heroin. Anyway, I'm in treatment for my PTSD and really making great progress. Again, amazingly supportive husband, once a month we go to therapy together. I know this all has been tough on him, but he's stood by me through my craziest moments, withdrawal, relapses, waking up screaming from night terrors, you name it...

     Ok, so the shitty part... I went to have my yearly lady exam and to talk to my doctor about my general health and other concerns about a possible pregnancy. I've had abnormal tests before that were ""precancerous"", but came back normal for the re-tests. So I was a bit nervous, but not insanely nervous. My doctor ordered blood to check my general health so I can prepare to maybe be a mommy in the next year or two. Well, today my doctor called me back about one of the tests, it turns out I had a ""strong reaction"" to the Hep C antibody test. I've either had Hep C and fought it off on my own, or I'm currently infected. I went in for the definitive test and I'll hear back by the end of the week. 

     It really broke my heart, I was doing so great. The worst part is: What if I infected my husband? He's an innocent in all this, and has doing nothing but support and help me through everything little bump in the road. He deserves so much better than me, he doesn't believe so, but it's obvious. I'm sorry, I know I'm being a bit melodramatic and there are much worse problems in the world... and of course, it could always be much worse. 

     Thank you for reading this :) Do any of you have any advice or stories you'd like to share? I'd love to hear them, encouraging or not. I love you guys, I may not post a lot, but I read probably 80% of the content on here lol.",1494977122.0

What bothered me is that he also warned me of addiction. It sound like he was implying that I was beginning to cross a fine line. However, at the end of the appointment he sounded cheerful. Not sure how to interpret this appointment. Should I just give up on hope for complete pain management? Should I not mention a dose increase in the future anymore?

Ok, so havent had a drink, a smoke of green or tobbaco, a speedball, a shot of h, a shot of white since about 4-5months ago, have lurked a couple times but hardly at all tbh.

Things have been going well! I wasnt heavily addicted by most accounts but i did hit wd's midway through my use after a 3week binge of speedballs. Resumed using after that, h iv with a couple speedballs for a one/and next day stint, but didnt get wd's again.

Right, trying to formulate this into a somewhat useful post for yall lol I threw myself back into fitness after about a year of doing nothing and that really has helped, I know from personal experience that the LAST THING ON EARTH you want to do when felling down/on a comedown/depressed/feeling just low in general/feeling anxious/on wd's is ""workout, go for a run"" but seriously.. it has helped! It has boosted my confidence MASSIVELY and also helped me deal with most tempations?(well maybe not and onto the next poiinst lul)

Right.. I've resisted most temptationst to relapse for the past 4-5 months, one day after gym I did get some cocodamols with caffeine, didnt really get much of a opiate buzz(was 2months or so ago, havent used before or since then since my sobriety) think this was due to the cafeeine, but i did get highish lol.

I will admit i've had ""cravings"" but they have been weird, more about going over the many days/months of using beforehand where i just think of a day when i got high or w.e and how i felt, but then i realse this (have been practicing mindfulness) i bring myself into the present and distract myself!
Ok, so getting to the crux of it, today, I gave into temptation and had the opportunity to buy some booze and grabbed a half L of vodka and ooooh mama, it feels good xD

Yeh, anyways gna stop this post here and just ask your thoughts on how to deal with walls breaking down after time in sobriety and how you guys handle it all, i mean i lost everything when i went ham on the drugs and yet i stopped everything, dealt with it well but yet, when the opportunity presented itself BOOM im getting a buzz/high again eek!

6bw1an,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6bw1an/i_just_wanna_vent/,8,https://redd.it/6bw1an,HeyHoldDis4Me,I just wanna vent,"So idk where to start... I guess I'll let u know I'm on mobile. I've been using opiates for like 2.5 years and I started with Vicodin. Just here and there at first and after .5 years I started popping pills as often as I could and after another half a year I switched to h. Everything was going great, I had a job, working my way through school, and no one knew about the h except a few friends. So fast forward to about 2 months ago... Me and my mom got into a fight, the biggest fight we've gotten into ever, so she kicks me out (this has never happened. She told me I had ten mins to get my shit and leave or she's calling the cops so I pack clothes, a toothbrush, my ps4, a gallon of rum and about 15 Xanax bars and leave. So right as I left I found myself a spot to sit down away from anyone and toss 4bars into my mouth and chugged a lot of my rum. I get up and head to a friends house a on the way pop a few more bars (I was emotional b/c I'm a big mamas boy) and drink some more. So at this point I'm at my friends and blacked out. I remember being still so upset and start begging my friend to help me get some dope and reluctantly he does. I don't remember much after that.

The next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital. I had OD'ed. My parents and brother were there crying and I felt like shit. None of them knew I was doing heroin so they were shocked (obviously). 

They wanted me to stop, start seeing a counselor, and were calling me an addict. I've never seen myself as an addict. I never touched the needle, I never went through w/d, I never NEEDED it. So that was like a month and a half ago. I stopped using for a month but I have depression and I don't want any ssri's so opiates (as I'm sure some of u know) was my antidepressants.

Now I just turned 18 on the 27th and graduated high school 3 days ago and still have my job that I had before I started the heroin. And last night I was in the bathroom smoking some fire tar when my mom knocks and asks if I'm doing drugs... I said yes (I try to not lie to my mom ever). Now she's begging me to get on anti depressants and stop doing drugs. I know I could but why the fuck would I want to? I do so much for her... I loan her all kinds of money, run errands for her, buy her drugs (opiate pills), and all other kinds of thing. Now she wants me to give up the one thing that makes life bearable, the one thing that makes all my problems fade away. I can't. I don't want to. Maybe that makes me an addict. But all I want is to be happy. 

I don't expect anything from this post I just needed to type what I was feeling.

Everybody says that heroin is the most addictive drug out there, and having personally tried pretty much all of what's around, I gotta say that I pretty much agree with that. 

I'm also a casual cocaine user... just for the occasional speedballs, nothing more. Never got hooked to it. Once or twice a month, that's it.

""Even crack isn't as addictive as heroin, so you're safe with cocaine"" is what I've often heard. It also made sense, you know, if I'm able to not become addicted to cocaine, then the same thing should apply to crack, right? After all, it's the same substance... right?

--

Two days ago my coke guy didn't have soft on him when I decided I wanted my monthly speedball... so instead of waiting for literally the next day to get soft, I took the hard he offered for cheaper (to make up for not having soft like I wanted).

He said it was very good quality crack too, and his coke is flawless so I supposed that made sense.

--

But I gotta admit guys, this shit got me by the balls right now. Worse idea ever. Stupid fucking me.

--

And now I just prepped my foil to smoke my rock before even prepping my H, which I would usually do before running away from a fucking burning house... can you imagine that?

And worse part is, I'm getting more of his crack tomorrow. Just when I thought one life-draining addiction was enough...

Am I digging a bigger hole with both addictions colliding or will I just get bored of crack soon and go back 100% to heroin? Have you guys ever heard of people being full-blown addicted to both? That's financially impossible, isn't... or people switching from heroin to crack? Nah that, that would be impossible.

I was thinking back to the people I spent the last few years spending time with and none of them are friends, they were just running partners. I've let so many people use me over the years because I was afraid of being alone.

I Used to always sell drugs to support my habit and there were months that I was only breaking even because I would give some away for free because I wanted to be a good friend. There were even times I've caught them flat out robbing me and I ignored it.

Idk why it took me until getting sober to see that I have no friends. It wasn't until I had nothing for them to use that Everyone bailed. But idk what I expected. The drugs lie a lot they make you think everything is great when the world is burning around you. I still have burned into my head as a special day the first time I got high even tho I did nothing but play call of duty and eat Doritos. I guess the same thing happened to people I got high with... I remember friendships and great conversations in my head but really when I look back were nothing more than high ramblings and the moments before we copped and got high we didn't speak to each other.

Idk how to have real friends after so long. I became accustomed to giving you shit so you'll like me so that I never have to actually work on myself or grow as a person. Fuck I feel so dumb about so much of my past and it's going to fucking suck moving on.

my main question is, regarding the title, is that i came up on a real script of the 1mg blue xanax footballs. (NOT the green bars. I KNOW they are presses)

ive heard sooo many times that ANY real xanax is hard to find. how lucky did i get to find this??? personally i have not seen a real bar/any kind of xanax in literal years. 

this is also the beginning of my withdrawl kit to start tapering/at least lowering my usage. and so far i actually have been using less when i do use!

and seriously loperamide works wonders. i havent taken they say GG 258, blue, football shape etc. i got them straight out of a pharmacy, how rare are real ones of these? are they even pressed?

ALSO: i am goin to ENGLAND/SPAIN/EUROPE  in a month! i will probably take a few blues/xanax with me. and obviously stock up on some lope, kratom, etc - we already went thru this. 

i have my own ways of getting shit through the airport, but any other suggestions?

also, i am really desperately looking for some damn SUBS to help me through the trip, i still cant find SHIT anywhere. tf is that. 

ive always wondered what the opiate scene is like in ENGLAND/SPAIN/EUROPE

thanks again to all the people who are nice to me even though my posts are always weak & the same lol. i really love you guys! youve helped me more than my ""real"" friends. 💕

EDIT: I KNOW THE GREEN BARS ARE PRESSED. I AM TALKING ABOUT THE BLUE FOOTBALLS. just those.

I am legally prescribed Suboxone 2 mg/day,  and my last does of suboxone was yesterday (Tuesday). But even though it's legally prescribed, I am 99% certain my employer will not allow this. My job is in the medical field, where it requires alertness and attention to detail, and I'm pretty sure I signed somewhere that I have no history of addiction nor have I ever been in addiction treatment.

So here's my plan/question: Do you guys think that FENTANYL will not be a drug that is tested for? My suboxone doctor uses a 12-panel drug test, and strangely enough Fentanyl is not on this test. Would I be better off taking FENTANYL until Monday, so that I can flush the bupe from my system before the test? I'm pretty sure buprenorphine is gonna be on this fuckin test, and I've already told my whole family I got this job. It will be embarassing if I test positive and get turned away.

I've been checking out the different methods of distribution / branding / packaging from all over in the ""porn"" pics on this sub. 

My preference would be for wrap / balloon packaging - ""stamps"" look cool but the little wraps are great for swallowing and regurgitating. 

It's v reassuring to have a somewhat foolproof method of concealment from the 5 oh if needs be. 

Although, earlier today the lad who was selling to me took the wraps out of his mouth and handed em to me dripping wet - and let's just say that his oral hygiene left a lot to be desired... 

When i first started out in this game that used to really bug me and as soon as I'd get home I'd attempt to disinfect the little wrap with dettol / rubbing alcohol / even bleach... 

Now I barely give it a second thought. 

It's one of the insidious things about heroin that no one ever warns you about before you pick up a habit. The do-gooders focus on the addictive nature of the drug and peddle stories about rat poison and ground up glass... instead of actually telling you about the reality of the drug, the little things, like having to take something out of a strangers mouth, dripping in their saliva, while looking at their rotten toothy smile... then concealing it in your own mouth... and the scary thing is that heroin changes the way you think about everything, so where once upon a time you would have never in a million years have contemplated an unappealing oral exchange like this... heroin lowers all of your standards and makes you shove that wrap in your mouth like it was a tasty bite of a lovely home cooked meal... 

And of course, many of us will have had to confront the reality of handling wraps that have emerged from far less appealing orifices than the dealers mouths... 

A turning point for me was when I realised that before handing over the dealer was storing my wrap up his arse... and I no longer cared... indeed on one occasion I had to keep watch while his girl helped him to retrieve a wrap that he had over enthusiastically shoved up himself when he spotted the cops. Fun times. 

Heroin really does cause you to reevaluate what certain fundamental core values mean to you... like, dignity... self respect...

UK junkball here, preferred roa is IV, so last night i was given 2x OC 30, the round brown/orangy ones, OC on one side, 30 on the other, so i searched the web high and low for the most efficient way to get them into me (as this is the first time I've ever even seen them in real life) and could only find all kinds of conflicting info, such as,
 use citric, don't use citric, 
dissolve in hot water, dissolve in cold water etc etc 

now i get why there's so much confusion, given the plethora of different brands and strengths, time release no time release etc 

what (i think) i gathered from reading was the time release ones have OP and not OC on them, bio-availability is highest when taken orally, but IV was the way to go (for me anyways) so by the time I'd read everything i was too scared to waste them to try some random iv method that 1. had ppl saying was correct and others saying incorrect and 2. I've no experience with oxy 

so i ended up taking of the coloured coating and crushing them up, snorted about half of one and swallowed the remainder, this was about 6pm, 10 hours earlier i had plugged 300mg of morphine sulphate, but around the 90 minutes later mark i deffo had a little glow from the oxy so my questions are 

1. was offered strips at £70 (per strip), is this a good or bad deal? bearing in mind they are legit 

2. I'm guessing there is 10 in a strip, is that the usual? 

3. if these are the ones that are IV'able (no time release) what is the drill for getting them into a rig

4. the brown I'm getting atm is really strong and for the same price i can get nearly an eighth, so is it even a good buy? bearing in mind I've been despo to try oxy-anything since i first heard about them.

5. if you check my post history you can see i have a good connect for almost unlimited supply of morphine sulphate tabs or MScontin (as most of you guys will know them as), what's the chances of getting my connect to try for the switcheroo from morphine to oxy?  (as they are terminally ill eneough to get seriously large amounts of morphine tabs, and a few bottles of oromorph pretty much as and when required but at least once a week)

i hope this makes sense as I'm full of morphine and methadone and I'm semi gouching (nodding)

I've been clean from heroin for a month now. I had one slip up about a week ago, but even after smoking, I just... didn't want more. I guess I got tired of being broke and sick all the time, and not having any idea how I fell asleep in some weird position. 

I did a quick taper with 2 subutex pills, after waiting absolutely as long as I could hold out during my w/ds. Took a half, another half the next day, then a quarter the day after that, another quarter, and so on till I was out. I don't know how long I can stay away, but for the moment, I'm starting to put things back together. Like, I've been a functional user, I've paid my bills first and used after, but this is still the longest I've been sober for two years. About 7 years ago, I fucked with fentanyl, and then had 4ish years sober, and found heroin when I was dealing with some suicidal thoughts.

I guess, in a way, it's good that I found it, but at the same time, I feel like I've just paused my whole life. In the past two years, I haven't chased any of my dreams, and now here I am with a clear head and no fucking idea what to do.


To anybody here that's clean, how do YOU deal with the boredom? I mean, it's one thing to use because we're depressed, but I don't really hate myself right now; I'm almost proud for once. But when I sit up at night, with the money I have saved from NOT using, it's like I'm taking on a pack of wild dogs with the cravings. I mean, I've tried all of my normal time eaters- video games, guitar, books, drawing, and everything just reminds me of using. I don't want to go back, but oh my fucking god, I miss that goddamn feeling of nihilistic contentment.

Anyways. I'm just ranting now. If you wanna get clean, I believe in you. If you don't, stay safe and have fun if you can.",1495194716.0

Even if this doesn’t give you a different perspective or agree with some parts.**

&nbsp;

I am a dude, and I am bisexual. I'm open about my sexuality in certain environments where I know it wouldn't affect my social life negatively.

&nbsp;

I've come across some posts here that involve topics of trans people. It's okay that people can be like ""whoa that is *fucking* **WEIRD**. Never seen anything like that in my life. What the **FUCK**."" Sure! It's not something you're accustomed to in your daily life, and it's totally fine to have such reaction when you come across the idea of 'a girl with a penis.’

&nbsp;

What bugs me is that as far as I have seen, r/opiates is a tight knit community where people accept each other for who they are. Junkies are junkies—it doesn't matter who you are, so long as you know the life of being an opioid/opiates addict.

&nbsp;

There ***are*** trans people that are fucking stuck up SJWs that come off as total bitches, expecting everyone to understand what it is like to be a trans person. It's only been a few years since the idea of trans people being out of closet in public became something to be acceptable in social norms.

&nbsp;

No one who's never been a junkie can *ever* possibly understand what it is like to be a junkie. They don’t know what it feels like to hide all the pills that keep you sane. To go to NA meetings with the intent of finding other junkies to hang out with. To go through withdrawals over and over. To have nothing in life that matters more than dope.

&nbsp;

It’s not that different.

&nbsp;

You won’t ever understand someone else’s life and their struggles fully.

&nbsp;

But having a biased opinion on a stereotype—to be hateful towards certain community of people without ever trying to see why the people are the way they are—

&nbsp;

I think.. that’s not something we should do collectively as a community.

&nbsp;

There are people out there that you wouldn’t ever possibly even guess that they are trans. And there are people out there that you wouldn’t ever possibly even guess that they are addicted to opiates, if you have never lived a life of being an opiate addict.

&nbsp;

I don’t know how to end this post, but this is just my thought I wanted to express after seeing people be so aggressively hateful towards other communities that struggle for their lifetime because of something they cannot change.

&nbsp;

You don’t choose feelings. It just is.

&nbsp;

People don’t choose to be queer. It’s a feeling, more than anything to be queer. They can choose to act upon their feeling and express their self-identity.

&nbsp;

SIDE NOTE:

1. The word ‘Tranny’ is a derogatory term. It’s like the word ‘Faggot’ to describe gay people.

2. You know how there are so many ‘tranny’ sex workers? That’s because for many trans women (Male to Female) are rejected to have any kind of opportunity to acquire a job. Even for minimum wage jobs, they are rejected solely based on their identity. But one thing that trans women can get good moolah out of is in the sex work industry. A lot of them resort to becoming a sex worker solely for that reason, not because that was their dream job. So try not to think of all trans women being prostitutes.

&nbsp;

Shoot me questions if you have anything to ask regarding this topic. Any comment is appreciated, and I will try to respond to every one of them. It’s alright if you don’t know the right words or anything. Being politically correct is not that important. I just want to help other queer junkies feel more accepted in r/opiates. Hopefully I can contribute to this effort.

(sorry i know its not a opiate but id rather share this with you guys rather then stims family) anyways me and datt were very close after that we shared alot of tears and secrets and we did everything together, me datt and slurry.. so point is me and matt and as tight as a nuns cunt. i told him today that i want to kill myself. not just want i'm afraid that i am going to go threw with it spur of the moment. i quit doing meth for a bit i had a slip a week or 2 ago, i also had a slip yesterday and today..matt didn't really say much.. his eyes said it all really. Today has been up and down.. yup probably party from the meth.. but also with all the little things ive been bottling up the past little bit. im going to come clean with something to you guys and im putting my trust out there because i AM NOT proud of this nor do i even want to admit it in writeing but i started filling my emotional bottle when i.. i slept with pretty much my only friend other then datts boyfriend. yup i slept with marias man when she was away. im the worst. like who the fuck does something like that.. im not even attracted to him. like i dont understand why im so fucking shitty. i read my just for today book early this morning to start my day..., may 18th,step 9; we made direct amends to such people wherever possible, that reading was really what i probably needed to hear. i have to tell her dont i ? I need advice on how to approach this... fuck. heres something else.. she came to chill last night and she was telling me about how her bf or wtv he is was saying he wanted to fuck all her friends and she was so hurt so sad. god do i hate myself. 2 years ago my rehab sister britt fucked my man.. i was devestated.. i was more mad at her. god i never been so hurt. how the fuck could i do that to another girl. fuck what is my issue. so theres the first bit of my new found self hatred. god this is long.. i cant stop typeing im gaked out.. i think i dont like meth anymore on a side note.. anyways yea so what else is eating me alive you may ask.. how bout the fact i cant control my anger, or my violent tendencies.. its not even that i get violent when im mad im violent with my friends when im in a great mood.. im fucking twisted get off on others pain. OH and lets not forget that i am a whore, literally(trying to change that as of right now ) and in the sence that i sleep around.. no i know thats not bad wtv sex is sex but considering datt lives here and he does love me i know that i know that hed do anything to be just next to me.. hes even getting fucking OFF METH with me.. if u knew matt you'd know this is a fucking miricule hes trying to get clean. alothough hes super co-depended unlike me, im super independent and pretty much am a loner by choice. i dont need anyone.. except for one person but ill get there in a sec. hoooold tighht. so yeah me im a whore in ever sence of the term and matt lives here and he whatches as i leave for hours and come home with a bunch of dope and money.. it kills him. and i have no filter on my dirty little mouth so of course i tell him stroys of me with other guys not even realising what ive said till after its been said. it destroys him.. oh man. whats wrong with me. Matt sees msgs i leave open that are super dirty, dirty pics and all and he also has to listen to me talk about kyle so much consdering hes been such a huge part of my life. so now im getting to the part where i tell you about the ONLY man i will every fucking love.. kyle. well i met him 5 years ago via datt and me and him have been threw ABSOLUTE HELL.. hes done some shitty things too me, i did worst to him of course cause im FUCKED. but after everything hes stood by my side in everyway someone in and out of jail can even dureing my meth and whore stage. haha you think datt was hurt by me.. kyle kyle he got the worst of it.. now he gets the best of me.. on phone calls.. hes in jail for 4 years.. and he fucked up and beat the living shit out of one of my ""exes"" from when me and kyle were on a break. hes a rat and deserved it but now kyles going to get his early realise witch was january 2018.. thats super early! hes getting that taken away poof gone, and tranfered to a jail where i have a gut feeling hes going to be killed because of something he did that landed an amount of money on his head... yah so theres something else thats been killing me inside.. thinking of loseing kyle and possibly endangering my family.. like what if thoes people that he fucked with come after me or my family because they cant get ahold of him and my family is the next best thing, even before his own family. everyone know me and his sister are his biggest and only weakness. fuck if he gets whacked or anything and he dies i swear to got i will overdoes on morphine because hes the only thing i love about myself hes the biggest part of me and who i am. hes my world. i wish i could of been better. so i been typeing this since midnight its five now, i took a few breaks to sketch out the windows of course. meth. im 100% sure that if i were to unload everything thats eating at me and driving me to want to FUCKING DIE it would be about a 300 page novel. that makes no sense and is most likely impossible to follow cause i'm TWACKIDY TWACKED. i cant wait to be sober (at least sober off meth) i dont like this buzz anymore. its scary depressing and embarrassing. so like i said i know this is a post about meth and this is a opiates sub but i always felt that opiates is a much better family, stims is okay but no sub is as tight as this one, because unlike stims opiates is so real and people die daily witch tend to drive people to look out for eachother alot better. stims will never be like this, everyone theres lost in ther own flail and stims are a selfish drug. fuck meth.. i fucking hate it, god damn i love it. fuck fuck fuck i cant sleep i just want someone to message me and have a deep convo or something.. IM GOING TO EXPLODE. please please keep your mean  cridaising comments to yourself i already know im fucking dumb and awful... i dont want to die. i dont want to leave my mom, brother and kyle and datt.. i do want to be dead tho. i wish noone loved me itd be so much easyer.. i dont understand how my dad killed himself knowing hes leaveing behind too little children.. he might of thought it was for the best but i think thats a big reason for why i am how i am. not blameing him i love and miss him unbelievably i been thinking latley that id probably be alot better of a person if i woulde of had a dad.. awwww i hate my head right now i need benzos and sleeping pills. i need to SHUT THE FUCK UP. yeah so if you want to message me i wont be like this in a few hours, i could really use a friend that i isnt going to be hurt by being my friend.. i need reddit friends.. im so lost. fuck im a sad sad little girl.

I came clean and told them what I took. Spent a couple days at the hospital and then went home. So the question is, did I OD on morphine or thebaine? The seeds were Australian blue or something like that and I heard they are notorious for high thebaine content.

I was at the climax of the ""romance phase"" with opiates personally. Everything was still bliss. Still 100% trying to get into med school.

As a senior member of my Fraternity we would organize philanthropy events around our region. Put a halo over our devil horns for a day every now and then. We'd been doing it for decades. This particular one being an NFL game. 

Over the years we'd learned how to hustle the absolute fuck out of them... *Frat Secrets*

The multi-billion dollar NFL Stadiums always allow a certain number of their concession booths to be ran by 3rd parties in the good name of tax deductible write offs. Luckily we had an amazing repertoire of young handsome college white boys and black college athletes who ""just wanted to raise money"" for some disease that some famous alum had in the 70s, get drunk, and hopefully get our dicks sucked somehow, someway. At least that's the face we put on. 

We fucking robbed them. 

We would arrive Sunday morning in the bowels of the stadium, freshly hungover about 30 deep. Pledges drove us the entire way on their unknowing parents dime as we would sit in their back seats feeding our noses with whatever we thought might cure our hangovers and prime us for our day of on the job trainginf of white collar robbery. 

As we arrived on game day the NFL Stadiums would give us AN ENTIRE FUCKING CONCESSION STAND with NO OVERSIGHT. We had free reign over this. The only management would be some random average looking chick who would be far too intimidated to ever confront 30 of the most well dressed tall educated 22 year old black and white college men she would ever see. 

Kickoff 1pm EST. 

As many of you Americans know the NFL aint no joke. These fucking 85,000 capacity stadiums are sold out more than not with drunk men and women looking to watch that god damn pigskin fire. 

Anyway, let me get to the hustle. 

The NFL stadium would give my Fraternity an entire concession stand TO OURSELVES with no oversight. We would work it frying the hotdogs with our nasty ass hands still smelling like pussy from the night before, and here's what we'd do. 

The stadiums counted the CUPS not the LIQUIDS. Every person who bought a beer @ ($14) or a Soft Drink @ ($10) as the front line merchants we would tell them ""The ******** Stadium is running a promotion....If you bring your cup back for a refill... we will give you a $4 Discount""... Yeah these 85,000 drunk fucking fans BIT.

Man. These HUNDREDS of men and women would be back for another beer every 10-20 minutes. Lined up around the fucking corner. As senior members of the Frat we would walk away with $1200 a person over the course of a 3hr NFL game. 

Good times. I rushed this story, but talk about some fucking partying the next week. AMA

EDIT: After they paid for their 1st beer at full price we would tell them about the ""deal"" and pocket every dollar that came through from them from then on out. ",1495158089.0

How can I tell the difference and what is an effective way to do it with my favored implement. Also, if i mix it with citric of some kind would that negatively effect the d and preclude a speedball..

I've been up for a week long crystal bender, I didn't even realize I was out of tar till the withdrawal hit.  I have just enough gas money to make it to town and back.  As the sweat drips down my nose and soaks my shirt I glance wistfully at the silent AC. 

I'm driving through one of the shittier neighbourhoods of a small city outside the Bay Area, hoping against hope to find one of the many people who owe me money or a favour. If I don't find someone I'm fucked, I don't have ends on a bag, hell i don't have 2 pennies to rub together.   My vision blurs as my blood pressure drops and I pull over in the shade of the trees of a small community park.   I open the door of my truck trying and failing to light a cigarette with shaking hands.   A group of high school age Nortenos go quiet and stare as they pass by.  
I nod to them, then look at myself in the rear view mirror..  Holy fuck, is that me?  A gaunt face with sunken eyes and huge dark circles stares back.  My neck is light blue and yellow up one side and covered in tracks, there's a few scabs on that side of my face too, if meth gets on my skin it always blisters.   I grab a hat and a button up shirt with a collar from behind the bench seat of my truck, I strip out of my soaked shirt and put on the button up leaving all but the top button undone.  As I'm about to start my truck I hear ""Mijo!  I've been looking all over for you!"".   I turn around to see N, she's an older Mexican lady, about 40 years old, 5'7 and carrying a decent amount of extra weight on her.  She looks like she could be someone’s mother.
  
""you look like shit""  She states matter of factly.

""I noticed"" I say with a tired crooked smile.
She smiles at me and asks ""Wanna get well and make some money mijo?
  
So off we go to the parking lot behind a warehouse, she pulls out 2 dime bags and hands them to me while packing the oil burner.   She cringes a bit as I hit the vein in my neck.   I turn to her feeling mostly human again and genuinely smile this time.  ""Better?"" she asks as she passes me the burner.
'I owe you one""  I reply.  
""Don't worry about it, I always make at least twice as much money with you, and I don't gotta worry about anyone trying to take it.""  She says as she tucks the burner back in her purse.    

We pull away headed towards the cheap motel on the outskirts of town by the truck stop.   When we get there its business as usual, she goes into one of the rooms, I sit outside smoking cigarettes with the windows down listening for any problems.  She always leaves the room door unlocked just in case.  Luckily Its unnecessary today, it usually is.  Johns act up less when they know someone’s outside waiting for the lady to come back.  

This is the first of 5 stops we make, 1 more motel and 3 migrant worker camps, some stops take longer or have multiple people in different rooms.  Everything goes smooth until the last stop.   We're outside of town surrounded by fields.  The temporary migrant housing looks like something out of the third world, there are broken windows covered by plastic and duct tape, tarps over some of the roofs.  I see a mother serving dinner to her 3 kids under a piece of plywood leaned against the van they live in.    

As I'm watching the mother try to wrangle her kids a realization hits me. It's been too long, she went inside almost 40 min ago.  I get a sinking feeling in my gut, these stops are always better money (the workers all get paid in cash at the end of the day and want to party), but much more dangerous.   I pull the bat from behind me and lay it on the seat,  wishing It was a gun.  As I get out of the car the door to the house she was in slams open and she comes out pulling clothes on while screaming in rapid fire Spanish.   4 men crowd the doorway in various states of undress, they're laughing and pointing.  N looks like she's about to burst a blood vessel.   ""Are you ok?"" I ask as she walk past me and slams the door of my truck.   I lean in and grab the bat.  ""No its fine mijo, I'm ok, they're just pandejos.  Can we just get out of here?""   She says as she uses the flip down mirror and composes herself.  

I get the story from her as we drive to the store for smokes ,beer and a meeting with the D-man.    From what I cold parse out, when the other guys living in the house heard what was going on they decided they wanted in and tried to run a train on her..  She got mad, kneed one in the nuts and stormed out.    We we're both lucky they laughed it off.   

After we pick up everything I drive her to her room and we do our shots.  On my way out she hands me a G of black and one of crystal along with $200 and gives me a hug.  ""Thanks mijo, I wont have to work for the rest of the week now""    
""No problem,  gimme a call if you ever need a ride.""  I say as I close the door.   

As I got home and laid down on my bed, comfortable in the knowledge I didn't have to hustle for the next few days, a quote from the book I'd been reading came to mind.

""Call a jack a jack, call a spade a spade. But always call a whore a lady, their lives are hard enough, and it never hurts to be polite.""

*edited some small grammar mistakes I noticed.  also the quote is from the book The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, great read if you like fantasy, but I wouldn't start it 'till he finishes the final book. (trust me you'll be pissed)*",1495149359.0

     Nepal dope I got was garbage, but $40 a gram, brown #3.  Opium was clearly mixed with some incense, ate it only.
     Malaysia was hit and miss at the same island 3 times on west coast.  First time cab driver offered me pot outside where I ate, I asked for something stronger, he offered meth, I said to help me sleep, he got me white heroin for ~200 ringgit ~$50USD a gram. (2 halfs).  
     Second Malaysia was super sketch.  Waited same area, no obvious junkies around, some hookers.  I asked a hooker in malay if she knew where to ""ambil dadah"" (use drugs).....  well I took her upstairs, got my dick WET and kept her stuff while she walked with 100 ringgit (~$25).  Bitch comes back with meth all excited, I rage at her (hate meth), she snorts it and I shove some in her pussy and fuck her again angry and then make her cop me 10 vials for heroin (about a G) for 150 ringits like $37 bucks.   
     Bitch gets wild, drinking, heroin in asshole , calls her friend I think will be fine chick... some asian tranny shows up fucked up on meth!!! I  kick her ass out at like 4am and then the first bitch just crashes after getting stuffed and doing about .3-.4 of my dope. I dip out without paying for any sex from meth girll, then get to airport at dawn with about .2 left to snort before plane ride at 8am.  Condom broke one time during the dope dick session and was scared of potential disease for 2 weelk, dodged a bullet but nutted all up in that bitch.
     Thailand was ~1am from Nigerians in the Big Mangor down soi 3 on a certain famous entertainment complex.... about 1 G wrapped in wax paper, then with electric tape tight, spit from an African's mouth to my hand.  Ran great on foil, think #3 rerocked with brown sugar or some shit, maybe 40-60% pure.
     Burma at border town, at liquor store looking at $4 whiskeys when a young kid (no way older than 12) offered me $1 marlboros and valium.  I bought 50 valium (shit presses local) for $5 and followed them to the pharmacy, bought some morphine sulfate (filled up an empty tylenol bottle) for ~2/100mg pill.  Kids brought me 5 G of cut up white heroin for $100, but probably only ~30% pure, still not bad deal.

I know tramadol has a bad name around here but if you wanna talk about withdrawals and tramadol can alleviate 80% if not all of the symptoms since it is an appeal by itself that means it does dilapidation but it's a lot easier coming off a moderate tramadol have it that's been going on for two weeks then A dope habbit that Has been going on for years.

What would normally be a 20 minute drive I turned into an 8 minute drive because I had to ""hurry up"". So I get there and of course there's 2 fucking cops just sitting in their car right where I'm supposed to be. Obviously I'm not going there, so this is the conversation that follows:  

Me: ""hey cop sitting right there, I'm up the street a little bit""

Dg: ""where you at?! I told you to go to street name""

Me: ""yeah there's 2 cops sitting right there, I'm literally right up the street on xxxxx Ave. ""

5 minutes later...  

Me: ""hey did you get my message?""

Dg: ""man I'm gone I was in a hurry! I told you to stay there!""

Me: ""wtf?! I was trying to look out for you! I was right up the street, can I go somewhere else?""

Dg: ""no man, come back at 12 I have to take kid to doctor""

Wow. This fucking bitch. 

Me: ""sorry, I guess next time I won't say shit and we can both get popped. I have shit to do later I can't come back""

Really? You have to take your kid to the doctor on a Saturday? Just it really blows my mind how dumb and inconsiderate dealers can be sometimes. Sometimes she's nice as can be, but every now and then I have to deal with this dumb shit. I'm sure if I would have said nothing about the cops I would have gotten in trouble too. 

End rant. 


EDIT: just so everyone is aware, she was lying about taking her kid to the doctor. She met me like 20-30 minutes after this ordeal. Im not some asshole incapable of empathy. You don't know me or her, there is no reason to be a dick. Especially since that wasn't even the point of the post.

-Someone does a shot of coke and fent/dope and ODs; media assumes they were sold in the same bag.

-Someone thinks they're buying a bag of coke but the d-boy accidentally gave them the wrong bag.  

-Someone ODs on fent/dope and was doing coke earlier in the day.  Tox screen comes back positive for both and they assume it was the same bag.

6ca9zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ca9zs/plugging_dilaudid/,3,https://redd.it/6ca9zs,sloan_fitch,Plugging dilaudid.,"This is an insane one. I've never done a suppository or anything.. maybe an enema when I was a child. So a friend gave me a couple of dilaudid 2mg and I didn't know what to do with them. 

Apparently the effect is doulble if you squirt it into your nose mixed with water than it is if you snort it dry. Oral... well nobody notices the effect. Plugging/up the ass? Well maybe I'm not properly equipped. I gave up half way.

So first I mixed the crushed pill with water. Didn't have an anal syringe or any anal tool so I used an eyedropper. Boy, where is my lube when I need it? Well, didn't feel it right away but then a warm body high did come on. Ended up dong a bag of H anyway bc I could only do half my dose of ass-dilaudid-water bfore giving up. The process was slow. Squirting the eyedropper is easy but loading it in there takes 40 seconds at a time.

Since the eyedropper can't hold the whole dose in one shot, I had to stick the dropper in my butt like 4 times and I still have some left.

After snorting a bag of H, even before snorting it I started to feel the warm body high. Maybe I was wrong... maybe this does work. Shit, no pun intended.. maybe I will finish what I started.

Long story short:
TL;DR:

It is said that dilaudid is more effected when dissolved in water and squirted up your nose with an oral syringe or something. Snorting it mixed with water may work but it'll bypass the membrane. 

Mixed with water then ""plugged"" does seem to work. I believe I feel something from half of a 2mg dose. So yeah, it works. Give it a try? Only if you got a better way than using an eyedropper... oh so tedious. Yeah, use some petro jelly too. ",1495285981.0

And I feel amazing!! Not how I saw my night going and for only $25. My dboy called me and asked if I cared to take a ride. I said sure I was gonna come over after work for a night cap. 

Anyhow this guy I have gotten stuff I wasn't happy with before and I am always vocal about it. Plenty of others I can go to but an AIO stop shop is great. Blues, ECP, white girl, dabs, loud, bars, well you name it. I don't even fuck with all this dude has. 

So I called him out an pressed bars before and pressed blues. Pointed out fent and he has always appreciated it as he likes his clients happy. So tonight I go over there and he ask me for my purity test as he was blown away by it last time I showed him. 

I get there and ask what he needs me to test. And he says nothing ATM but I want you to take a ride with me to his supply. Not sure how I feel about that but he assures me it is ok and worth my time. Well we get in the car and I ask why the hell he wants me to go? And he tells me ""Well your the only customer I have that isn't a pussy and tells me how shit is, the only time I find out others are unhappy is when you tell me and I ask them.""

So I think um ok and tell him I'm not trying to be a dick but I do like going to him and if I plan on doing so I want to be assured I'm getting what I am looking and paying for. Anyhow let's cut to the story. He likes that I am up front but not a dick. 

I usually get some straight up fish scales from this guy but like three weeks back I got some bullshit from him no other word for it. I promptly called him up and asked wtf was up and why did he start stepping on his shit. You want more money ask for it. I ask for quality shit so I expect to pay. He ask me wtf I am talking about and I take a ride back over to his place. I had a half gram of his last shit saved for a special occasion and I see this as a special occasion. 

I bring over the bullshit and the fish scale. And show him the difference visually and then I go to load up a nice Bell ringer and boot the good shit. Within 5 seconds I feel my ears ringing my belly is having a hard time not up chucking and I feel fucking amazing. I made sure to show him just how clear everything was loaded up in my rig. 

So now we have shown him his fire and time to move on to to bullshit. As soon as I add water it's cloudy and murky. I use a filter on it and ask why I used a filter on this one. I promptly tell him that it ain't supposed to get like that. The water needs to look like water. Not chalk. So he still isn't convinced so I pull out a purity test. The fishy scales turns a deep orange and easily gets the four star rating. The other shit barely gets a one. He says thanks and he will make it right soon.

So I bring my kit with us tonight and the guy offers me a ""taste"" and instantly I am fucking floored. Never have I had anything this pure. I turns a deep deep Burgundy red easily hitting the highest my cheap test can register. He ask me how much I was looking for I said just a teener and flash $25 bucks. He knocks of this Boulder and says here ya go. That was 7:30pm yesterday. I'm drawing my last boot and got 4mg of Xanax to put my ass down. 

He says that's for being ""real"" whatever that means just a white boy that knows what I want and it ain't to be rolled over on as I am 40+ and no time for bullshit. But man this is anything but bullshit. In all my life I ain't never had every boot be a damn bell ringer LOL. Night fam ",1495274367.0

I have been religiously reading this sub since discovering reddit. Finally decided to, just maybe, contribute once and a while. 


Along with seeing a lot of nasty, mean, humble bragging posts, there are a lot of posts and comments that are heartfelt, meaningful and good natured. That's what I think makes this place so interesting to me. Addiction knows no race, religion, economic status right? 

Been doing the damn thing for around 10 years now and never once caught a charge for anything. 
Well today was the day I thought my lucky streak ended.

I live across from a school, and cutting through the school to the main road, let's just say, makes life a lot easier. After visiting the dboy I cut through the school and pull directly into my driveway. As I am getting out I see and unmarked taurus pulling in right behind mevery.

He yells ""whoa whoa where do you think your going""
I sneakily slipped my brick in between my seat and the center console and exit the vehicle.

I ask him what's up and he says why did you cut through the school. I tell him I'm sorry and I know there is a no thru traffic sign and I won't do it again. 

He approaches me even closer and asks why I am so nervous. (I wasn't showing any signs of nervousness by the way) i tell him I am not and immediately after finishing my sentence he grabs my shirt and throws me against my car and begins searching me. 

I explain that I do not consent to a search and he says tough shit I'm being searched for police officer safety. After finding nothing on me, and trust me he searched everything from the inside brim out my hat to my socks, he begins going through the car. 

I explicitly state that I do not consent, a request that he ignores. As he is going through my car I'm thinking, ""welp this is it, you had a good run, looks like it's game over for me "" 

I stand there in front of my car and watch as he tears everything apart just waiting for the inevitable. After 10 minutes he finds....nothing. I can not believe my luck. I don't understand how he didn't find the brick. It was practically visible without touching anything. He looks at me and says have a nice day and drives off tail between his legs. 

That's it just thought I would share the luck I just had all while introducing myself for the first time. .
And to the OP that just told that lyft story....you are completely right. Everyone needs to find their saneness. What we do is insane. Gotta keep stringing those days of being sane together.

Guy was tripping shit and tweet convinced him to throw out his stash then check into rehab…. 14 grams of pure mda (Sass, supposedly, but might’ve been some weird research chemical. No euphoria like cocaine i.v. buta tiny bit would keep you awake for DAYS) but it was so ridiculously strong, I mixed some of it with the 10 grams of special k he also had… Called it molly, (Definitely not). (Tweet would front it to me to sell) 5 bags of heroin, with a bunch of special k…. then the sass to wake you up in nodding too hard… I probably used, traded most of it. I remember sitting up one night, trying to bag it up….. (I’d cut straws up and burn one end, then scoop some in, then burn the other end to seal it like a bag) and doing shot after shot of the ketamine…. It was pure, dissolved in water clean. Anyways, rambling…. This is a story about J
	J was facing federal charges for moving like 7 ounces of something (Ecstacy over state lines maybe?)…. He was on probation.
	Motherfucking juan didn’t have any fish scale cocaine left…. I told him, in more than one fucking text, I couldn’t get powder, but tweety-fuck, wanted to sell him 2 grams of the mda/speed/whatever the fuck it was.

“I can get an upper you can shoot if you want to try it….”
	He came by and tried it… loved it (Thought it was coke from the rush which it wasn’t…) bought a few grams. Went to the city (for whatever reason…. He had done wayyyyyyy too many shots of the shit by this point)

	Tl;dr. He gave a guy a bump, the guy thought it was coke, started freaking the fuck out after 15 or so minutes and jumped out of a 3rd story window…. Broke his fucking legs. I got a lot of nasty texts the next day,

My first ping was for a man named Rob who lives down the street from me. He approached my car with a smile and a wave and opened the passenger door asking “hey I’ve never done this before do I just sit up front?“ I said “yeah yeah you’re good hop in.” We immediately started discussing life on some deep shit. He showed me a book in his hand and began describing it as a spiritual journey of a man who was extremely smart and went through multiple religious journeys in search of his enlightenment. Rob told me that he had read the book a few times in different periods of his life and got different things from it at different times. He briefly mentioned he was a recovering addict so I told him I could relate and that I read some philosophy stuff every once in a while to help me put things into perspective whenever I’m going through some shit. He sat still for a minute, then approached me with a completely new tone explaining that his brother overdosed and died two weeks ago and that his car that we were going to pick up was left at a gym because his friends there have been holding him up the past couple of weeks. There was a very candid silence followed by some small talk as we approached his car. He handed me his copy of “Siddhartha” that he was clutching onto and said “my brother was clean for seven years, then used for four days and now he’s gone. If you ever have a bad day, you know where I live. you can come over and we will hang out and my wife will make you dinner.“ Thank you’s were exchanged and a chain of handshakes turned into a hug. We parted ways and I saw some weight leave him as he approached his car. Rob seemed to imply that I had helped him find some peace today but he doesn’t have a fucking clue what he did for me. I do not believe in a god or gods, but I do believe that we are souls having a human experience and I have experiences like this every once in awhile and I believe most people do. I think we’re just running into each other on an as-needed basis. I believe that Rob and I were just a moment in time that can never be revisited and doesn’t need to be.

I was mixing oxy, lorazepam, and flexeril. So an opiate, a benzo, and a muscle relaxer. I binged for four days straight. Finished a full script of the oxys and the lorazepam taking the flexerils just to potentiate. Smoked a lil bud

Then for the following three days I was mixing weed,  amitriptyline, and flexeril to sleep all day.

Now that I've come down from the binge  my heart rate is through the roof.

Do I need to be worried? I never had this problem when mixing just flexeril and opiates

I was doing 200-300mgs of oxy a day for the last several months. After last Wednesday I stopped. One thing I noticed is that Kratom works real well. I have used Kratom before for wds and taken it invetween doses when I was low on oxy. What I did this time was day 1-4 I took a table spoon of Kratom in the morning non more then on day 5 and 6 I didn't take any. On day 7 I was feeling sluggish and wanted to relapse . Mind you in the last year I went 7 days 2 other times and relapsed in day 7. This time instead of relapsing I got some more Kratom which is another reason I didn't take any day 5 & 6 cause I had ran out of Kratom. Anyway this time I took it and wow! I actually feel the stimulation and almost like I took a norco but not exactly the same if you know what I mean.

I have no job to let it be water under the bridge so I have no money to get a new one. He gets 90 10mg Valium a month, could I use that to my advantage to threaten him or tell him to pay me in pills if he wants it back then sell them.

She takes a lot of Oxy a day for her arthritis pain. She's been taking Oxy for years and has mad tolerance.
She wants to get off them because they are to much money. When she misses a does she goes into w/d really fast and hard. I told her to taper off them and switch to medical marijuana ( apparently its good for arthritis) she told me she would never touch a dangerous drug like that. I tried to tell her how bad Oxy is and it's like heroin etc. But she thinks cause a doctor prescribes its fine. She literally thinks that weed is a hard street drug and if you do it that you'll get reefer madness.
My head hurts talking to her about this lmao ",1495213464.0
6c4uzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6c4uzq/drug_test_help/,11,https://redd.it/6c4uzq,berryfrezh,Drug test help.,"Okay, I have finally decided I need to get serious about a job. Shit, I think I have worked a month total since September last year. The girl who usually works 70 hours a week to nothing, y'all I have lost my mind finally. And bills are adding up, wake up today and realize I got til the first to pay my mortgage, home owners (like what is that even?! SHIT!), and utilities. 

I am going to a bunch of temp services Monday and will walk out of one with at least some sort of income. But here is my issue, obviously I use. 

I can pass a mouth swab, but have no clue how to pass a piss test. Everything I Google tells me it will not work on opiates. I know temp services do 6 point tests and only look for opiates not specific  kinds. I have papers in my purse for a script of Norcos from what like a month ago? Don't have the bottle, shit is long gone. But it was for a toothache. Could I just pull those papers out and say I've been nursing them for extremely bad toothaches until I get to the dentist? I believe I heard someone say scripts are good for the last 90 days with jobs, like as long as I can prove I have had something in that time from matching my drug test results I'm legit. 

I also did bars and meth Monday or Tuesday, will they be out of my system by Monday? I only did like maybe $5 worth of the meth and two and a half bars. ",1495212621.0

6c4nqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6c4nqv/pushing_the_envelop/,15,https://redd.it/6c4nqv,Clay_22,Pushing the envelop,"Sorry, I meant 'envelope'. 

I'm sure I'm going to be ridiculed/derided for this post (because I've been very stupid). So let me start by saying I'm fully aware of how dumb I've been.

I'm an 81kg (I think that's about 180lb?) male. 

I have some opiate tolerance (even though I use maybe three days in a row in a month only I seem to have a baseline tolerance that doesn't go away, at least that's my perception of it because 20mg used to get me very high now it's effects are fairly subtle).

I have a benzo tolerance but not much of one. I use Xanax (1mg and occasionally 2mg) about 3 times a week. 

I took 2mg Xanax then about two hours later took somewhere around 30mg instant release oxycodone (it's a 40mg capsule but I tipped a bit out). Both taken orally as you would expect. 

I've also done about 0.3 of good quality coke (insufflated). 

I'm nodding like crazy, feel really very high. It's difficult to stay awake. 

I knew before I did this the dangers of mixing benzos and opiates (not to mention adding coke into the mix) but, while this isn't a suicide attempt (at least not a conscious one) I've been pretty down recently, so who knows why I did this.

I think this e-mail is fairly coherent, I can walk around at a normal pace, don't feel breathless or anything. 

But I don't think i've ever felt this high or exhausted. Many stuff on bluelight, etc says that combining these drugs is moronic (I don't deny it) or even a 'death sentence'. I know the combination can kill people.

Do you think this is a go to the hospital situation or am I just really high? I know nobody can tell for sure but based on the limited information I'm able to give you, how much danger am I in?

Feel free to have at me, I deserve it and thank you for reading. ",1495210740.0

Same thing happened to another kid.  They did a specific test fore fentanyl, and still nothing. They said the fentanyl test isn't super reliable.  Anyway,  whenever I do the ""Dope"" , it gets me well, and high.  I'm just curious wtf in putting into my body. Any ideas? ",1495210367.0
