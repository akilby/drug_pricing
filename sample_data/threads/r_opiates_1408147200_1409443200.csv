2dpsps,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2dpsps/my_current_issue/,30,https://redd.it/2dpsps,dcache,My current issue...,"So I use about 140-180mg of oxy daily for about three days then switch to Tramadol 900mg daily (I know seizures, but I have been doing this for months with no issues), then if I run completely out I use 15g daily of kratom.  My schedule is 3x a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner.  I have legitimate pain and all of them help with the pain to some degree.  I would say with the oxy abuse sometimes I have almost no pain.


Here is my current issue.  I can't get high off oxy anymore it seems.  Yesterday as a experiment I took like 1.5 my normal dose as my last dose since for 2 days it was like I was taking nothing but it kept me out of wd. After this ""large dose"" I literally felt like I went into mild precipitated withdrawals, restless legs kicked in and I was anxious as fuck.  After about two hours it calmed down and I was just mildly relaxed like I took a tenth of what I took.  I also feel like if I take a third of what I normally take I actually get more euphoria but the overall high is weaker and shorter.  

Anyone else have this experience or have any advice as to what is going on or what I should do?  



tl;dr - Oxy not working (no euphoria) even if I up the dosage.",1408190378.0

Opiates are the one class I have the least experience with. I also don't have much tolerance atm and am a small guy (65kg).

I've heard there are different types of fent patches and some are a lot easier to abuse than others; the ones I have now are called 'Durogesic 25', they are small and transparent 25ug/hr patches.

First I tried heating; An alfoil-wrapped heating pad was held onto the patch for around an hour (it stayed very hot the whole time). No noticeable effects. Then I tried a bit of potentiation, a few valium, some promethazine, dph, a couple of drinks.. maybe I was feeling a tiny bit buzzed but I wouldn't have even noticed if I wasn't trying.

(disclaimer: mixing downers is dangerous, mixing stims is dangerous, mixings drugs is dangerous. danger danger will robinson mmmk)

That night(last night) I went to some clubs with my (hopefully soon to be)gf. from around 6pm-6am I had around 30mg d-amphet, 30mg valium, 10mg lorazepam, 600mg pregabalin, 7 or 8 standard drinks, and a couple of average pingers. (I have an extremely high benzos/alc tolerance so I was fine at this point; I wasn't slurring or staggering (I wasn't even uninhibited enough to hit the DF). 

I was being very cautious with my drinking; I'd usually drink at least double that (no I'm not bragging, I'm not proud of it, I reply on benzos, alcohol, other gabaergics or social drugs like MD or coke..well no not coke.. who wants to pay $300-$400/g for shit so stepped on you may aswell just rail your ritalin) etc. temper my crippling social anxiety)) because of the fent patch and how I'd heard how dangerous they could be. 

But again.. nothing noticeable from the fent.. today I decided to give the sublingual way a shot, (hadn't taken or drunk anything else since the other night) I had no idea if I was doing this right, but i just cut off around 1/10th of the patch and stuck it under my tongue for around 20mins (I've heard people saying 15 seconds is enough and others saying 30mins). that was 1hr ago, again nothing.. 

Any tips/advice etc. would be much appreciated and yes I know messing with fent can be very dangerous especially sublingual and other downer combos... so please don't come in here just to say that. I'ts my life and I can do wat I want with it :) 

Thanks in advance.. sorry for typing so much~dexies.",1408179575.0

I have some fentanyl powder that was procured from the place of the world's most wonderful and rare substances that are of high purity and do not involve doctors or street dealers.  Sorry if that's dumb, I don't want to get in trouble for sourcing or anything of that nature, not sure how much I can say but I bet many of you will catch my drift from that sentence.  If not, just check my reddit post history and you'll get it.  

I purchased the two following item listings from a source that, as I am to understand, is completely legitimate, reliable, and completely pure: 
--10mg Pure Fentanyl HCL
--10mg Pure Fentanyl Citrate

I also would have had a third option of purchasing Acetyl Fentanyl, but I did not get to buy this form at the time since I read something on a random forum alluding to Acetyl Fentanyl not being IV-able; not sure if that is the case or not so please correct me if it is.

I haven't been able to find much information online about what to do with any of these forms of fentanyl powders, as I suppose they are relatively rare.  The seller and a redditor I asked have both directed me to make a saline nasal spray with it, which I am open to and will likely create as my first project, but I am curious what other options are available with this type of fentanyl.

I am most interested in preparing the fentanyl for IV injection, however, I understand this is extremely dangerous due to the potency of the drug and the fact that I don't have a scale sensitive enough to weigh out micrograms (or even milligrams)...that rules out preparing individual shots as I go, like I do when IVing heroin (mix up -x- number of bags with water each time I do a shot).  

*Also, prior to trying any IV injection of this, I will ensure that I acquire Narcan and someone to supervise in the event that something went awry.*

I was thinking that maybe someone had experience mixing powdered fentanyl with a fair amount of [hopefully bacteriostatic] water to dilute the concentrated powder, thus retaining this bulkier solution to draw up into syringes as individual shots.  If anyone has done so, please advise a. what type of fentanyl (HCl, Citrate, or Acetyl) and b. what ratios of fentanyl (mg) and water (ml) have worked well for you.  I am concerned that if I were to do this that it would be difficult to be sure the solution was mixed equally throughout, that I would not end up with a pocket with loads more fentanyl than other areas and overdose.

Of course, if my ideas above are totally off-base and I am missing some key concept(s), please educate me!  Any ideas or input is greatly appreciated, thanks all!",1408173810.0

One to go

Simplicity divided by the factor of zero

That cage of bliss


Blinded by the light


Unable to fight

Clinging to the rope

Darkness fades

I had a very consistent situation with a MM for the duration of my dope sabbatical.  However, he has now sprung the news that he is leaving me high and dry - with zero notice - and appears to have had his way with what he was holding for me and I was yet to picked up...

&nbsp;
  
This has left me rationing out the small amount I had left.  I am a few hours away from hell.  I got through about 48 hours of WD a few weeks ago, but had to turn around due to the loss of someone very important in my life.  Also, lope does NOT do ANYTHING for me, despite countless efforts and various combinations from research.

&nbsp;

Also, I am in the mettle of battling a disease which has gone on for a few months and had me virtually bedridden and impressively uncomfortable, but dope made things bearable (the codein I was prescribed isn't enough for obvious reasons).  I survived and am told I will be making a full recovery, but there are still residual issues, so WDing on top of my illness is something no one should have to experience 

&nbsp;

**My questions are the following:** If I cannot make it through all this, what options might I have in the Chicago area.  More specifically, are there any clinics or anything of the sort which remain anonymous (I have a somewhat ""prestigious"" job which cannot learn of my habit).  

&nbsp;
If I were to come clean to my family or the doctors, what can I expect...?  What is normally done to make an addict comfortable?  What are the ramifications in the future - especially anything in terms of insurance, either immediate or long term (such as perusing coverage years down the road)?

&nbsp;
I almost had some tramadol lined up, but that was just a torturous life line dangled above my head only to be pulled away.  I do plan to get cleaned up and address how I got here, I just CANNOT afford to do this right now.  Have way too much on my plate and am WAY too far behind due to my recent medical issues.

&nbsp;

I've never done anything immoral or harmful to others to get high, and have always treated others well and helped whenever I could, I just made a few bad choices and went down an alley of escaping the almost unbearable stresses of my career - and dont want to lose everything because of it.

&nbsp;

Anyway, any advice or input would be great.  Maybe, in part, I just needed to vent.  Or, at the very lease, just need to know that I'm really not curled up in this agonizing ball completely alone in this huge and beutiful city flying by outside my window.

&nbsp;
  
**TL;DR:**     I have been abandoned by a MM I took VERY good care of for months, and now a facing WDs at the WORST possible time.  I need to know where I might be able to turn if I can't get myself through this alone - but more importantly, what are the ""side effects"" of coming clean to medical professionals as far as disclosure to insurance or anything of the sort?",1408164636.0

2dopjs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2dopjs/pain_clinic_alternate_options/,18,https://redd.it/2dopjs,nodout94,Pain Clinic (Alternate Options),"So, after my appointment on wednesday, this was my first appointment with this doctor. I had talked to him on the phone and my relatives have told me very good things about him, he is one of the best pain doctors in the state. Very active in the medical community etc. etc. 

Well, I went there on wednesday and he looked over my MRI himself and notice that I have Spinal Arthritis, and 3 bulging disks in my lower back and degenerative disk disease. He asked me what medications I was currently taking, I told him cyclobenzaprine here and there as well as 5/325 hydrocodone 6 times a day. He shuttered as I told him this, he said, ""you are far too young to be on that kind of medicine."" he doesn't know about my multiple year heroin addiction. I refused to mention any of that to any of my physicians, I don't want to get black listed as being an addict even though I'm clean now. 

Hydrocodone doesn't do anything for me except take like, a little bit of the edge off, less than 10% pain improvement. My pain doctor set up an appointment for an injection into my lumbar area where the most damage is at. He wants to figure out what the main cause of my pain is, but he seems EXTREMELY reluctant to give me any sort of narcotic. All of my relatives have gotten zohydro, oxycontin, hydromorphone, etc from him and their cases aren't nearly as bad as mine. I have physical proof of my condition, it's documented and visible on my MRI's.

I am really upset, because I told him that I've been on plenty of narcotic based pain killers in the past, stronger than this as well. I've had 7+ surgeries throughout my life, all of which had me on narcotic pain killers. Hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, etc. I told him this but he said ""Do you understand the long term consequences of what you're taking right now?"" I was baffled when he asked me this. Hell, I went to my GP before I even went to the pain doctor to just get a general diagnosis of what was going on and the first time I went in there, he wrote me up a script of 120 5/325 hydrocodones, on a whim. There was no visuals on my spine at that point, just my whining ass bitching about the pain.

Anyways, I'm extremely upset, should I go to another pain clinic? I've always encountered problems because of my age and appearance (i'm a metal head and dress as such lol) But now that I have my diagnosis and verifiable medical documents proving my condition I'm still getting a stiff arm from pain doctors regarding my age. This is ridiculous. I am getting really stressed over what to do. Opiate based medications have been the only thing that have ever given me relief, and I absolutely hate the plethora of NSAID's they throw left and right. They are fucking dangerous chemicals, tylenol is extremely toxic. NSAID's always mess with my blood pressure and give me all sorts of negative symptoms. Headaches, abdominal pressure, heart palpitations, but doctors keep pushing them on me. 

Basically I just want to know if I should push on to another doctor or clinic.

As it's my very first drug charge of any kind, they have a program where you successfully complete the sentence and they throw the case out. 

That sentence was two years probation, six months suspended license and like 100 hours community service. Already got my license back and the community service is whatever. It's the probation, specifically the weekly random UA that scares me. 

So about eight years ago I had just gotten out of federal prison after a small bid and had three years on papers. Wasn't drug related so piss tests weren't required. One time came though where I had my bi-weekly visit with him and he hit me with a UA. 

I ended up failing it for opiates. I told my PO it was vicodin for my back. He told me I needed to produce a script and that he would send it to the lab to confirm it was vicodin and not something else. I thought I was fucked. 

So I scrambled and got my vicodin script and then waited. He finally got back to me and said something along the lines of them not being able to tell one way or another but I was now on weekly random UA's. 

Confused, but thankful, I did some research. Remember reading something along the lines of the both heroin and vicodin being broken down by the body the same way and after 24 hours, the can't tell if it started as heroin or something else. Whew. 

So knowing how expensive lab tests were the, knowing how cheap the feds are, how irrelevant I was compared to many others in the federal system and with a vicodin script in hand, I basically continued to use for my entire three years on paper. No issues. 

Fast forward to today. Recently moved so just starting probation up. My random UA's start next week. I got my vicodin script, but tryimg to do some refresher research, I can't really find anything to confirm my past experience. And I'm starting to panic. 

Has testing changed where that would no longer fly? Was it always BS and my past probation was just too cheap for further testing since I already had a script? What's the deal? 

And what are my backup options? Obviously quitting but I already got a great connect and would hate to lose. Plus going from the East to the West, would love to give this tar a run for a bit. How will does the Whizzinator work? Expensive, is it worth it? Anyone in particular? A better product out there? Please give me good news. ",1408248359.0

I'm 20 years old and have been using for 3 years (1 year IV) at the peak of my addiction I was using half a gram a day as dope is 25-30 a point here. 
So I went to see my GP and he gives me a paper with outpatient and inpatient programs and numbers on them. I live in a small town and the closest centers are an hour away. I've never been in any treatment program before. I have tried to quit more times than I can even begin to list and detoxing/kicking is hard but I can do it successfully. My problem is STAYING clean and fighting the cravings.

I'm still on my parent's insurance (Tri-care) but I want to avoid them having to pay more money than necessary. I don't feel I need inpatient and I'm worried that outpatient will require frequent driving which I can't do since my license is suspended and don't want my parents to have to make a 2 hour commute back and forth.

So the question I have is; should I look for a sub doctor or would outpatient be the best bet for me? I feel like some kind of suboxone maintenance is the best option for me. Getting clean isn't the problem for me. Staying clean is. The longest I've been clean since using is maybe 2 weeks.)

So, I like to play with dope (NYC area, we get the little stamped bags)

My question is; Towards the end of binges, I feel like I am not getting high, even with large doses (for myself)

I'd typically do a bun (10 stamps) over maybe 2-3 days, but when I have been using for a while, I will end up basically doing as much as I can, and never get ""really high"" or anything close.

Over the weekend I was doing 2 bags at a time, and basically went through about 5 of them in 2 hours, and still really felt ""normal"" from all that, when any other time that much I would be nodding heavily.

I know my tolerance obviously continues to rise the more I use, but it doesn't seem possible for my tolerance to increase that much over the course of hours. I feel like no matter how much I did, I wasn't going to feel any different.

Anyways if you're lucky enough to get some Subs do so, you only need three. I'll usually start with a full strip on my second day after my last dose of whatever, then half the strip or pill the next day, then quarters till my 7th day from starting the Subs(some people may need to go longer/some shorter/just see how you're feeling between doses).  BAM what withdrawal !! lol Sometimes if you're like me and can wait almost two days to redose. This has worked for me a couple times like magic. There's no need to be on subs longer than the 7-10 days of withdrawal. Adjust the dose with your level of use, please don't start with a full strip or pill if you're only doing like 40-50mg of vics or percs !!!! IF you're still having troubles sleeping take 500-900mg of gabapentin and you'll be out like a fucking baby !!! I hope this helps atleast someone !!!! If you're on Subs or take them alot clearly this isn't going to work for you !!! Cheers guys be safe !!!


I figured I would add some stuff if you don't have the option of getting subs.

-gabapentin 500-1200mg It'll help with anxiety and help you sleep

-Imodium 30-????mg Keep popping 20mg worth every hour till you feel comfortable or if you just want the runs to stop take around 10mg every couple days (some people swear by this stuff others not so much... I only take 40mg at a time don't go too crazy !!!

-Xanax/Kponopin/Valiums These will help with anxiety, depression, and help you sleep if you double your dose before bed.

Besides those meds I would suggest to drink juice, pedialyte, Ensure (chocolate by recommendation) and eat fruits and light items for your stomach. Take HOT baths when your RLS is getting bad it helps lots !! Drink caffeine or energy drinks in the AM so you won't feel so drained during the day but DO NOT drink it later in the day or you'll have a worse time sleeping ! Now this will sound crazy but go walk around or run or exercise it will help with your mood, your aches, and something to keep you and your mind busy. That reminds me , you'll want stuff to keep you busy because your mind will be wondering like crazy so watch some netflix , read some books, play some video games, whatever you like to do just as your not sitting there with your mind  going 1867258726 miles a min ! I can't think of more things to add even though I know there is , i'll add it later or if any of you would like to comment please do !!! Thanks guys , stay strong !!!

Plus if he gets caught selling his meds he could lose the ones he needs, plus other legal actions.

The problem, I recently moved 7 ~~miles~~ hours away to another state. I have been getting small amounts from him, but I'm trying to use the change of location to do my sub regimen and don't really want to deal like I used to (not that I even know anyone down here). Plus I dont have a job and can't really afford much for personals.

So because I'm not really going to be able to flip at the rate he needs I've been thinking of pass him off. But here comes the problem. I don't know any decent people.

1st. Friend. Former junkie. Not that bright. He has connects which would make flipping easy, but I'm sure he'd do something stupid and get himself caught. And I'm 100% sure he would drop into an epic habit. And I don't want to do that to a friend, or my guy.

2nd. Another friend (more like friend of a friend but I know her pretty well). She is responsible enough? But I feel she has a pretty good chance of being addicted and being kind of a lousy dealer. I feel like she has less a chance than #1, but it's still there. Though between the two she'd stand the chance of gaining financially from this.

Annnnnd that's it. I had always planned to give my guy to my dope dealer, but he got clean a few months ago so that's out.

Or the final option is to continue shipping it from him to me and trying to get a circle of buyers down here, but I feel like that'd just be putting off the inevitable. 

Fuuuuck, I dunno. Why can't mother fuckers be responsible. Not that I can say much, I got the connect and became a fiend in about 6 months.",1408312683.0

Yo, r/opiates. I'm pretty experienced with opiates but have never used heroin. I'm about six months ""clean"" from a two year daily habit. I use scary quotes because I've been chipping for a few months now, but have kept it under control. No WDs since kicking and it's not interfering with my life. I only include this to preempt the ""don't do it"" posts. I've already stumbled down that road. 

My question has to do with dose and safety of ECP. I just picked some  up off the dark net and by all accounts it's absolute fire. I have a scale that accurately measures to the mg, so what would y'all recommend for a first timer via insufflation? I have pretty close to zero tolerance, if not absolutely none. A 30 gets me nice a high, but not quite nodding. Truthfully, I don't like to nod, just like to get moderately high and go about my business. 

I'm also curious about safety when dosing for the first time. If I play it safe and do 10mg every 20 minutes or so until I get where I want to be, is it necessary to have a friend around? 

As far as why I'm getting into heroin, it's simply a $ thing. I can't rationalize spending $200 on a few pills right now. I can't wait. ",1408293721.0

This is the worst though.  The anxiety.  two and a half hours.  Once that time is passed, I'll start blowin him up.  I pay double for fronts because I'm financially irresponsible but Since I'm paying top dollar, I feel that allows me the right to blow him up for my front.  

If he doesnt come through, i have some suboxone i could take, but yall know how that goes.. I'll have that strip finally dissolve and then he'll hit me up like ""yo I'm outside"" or something else will come through

I was gonna leave it because it looked pretty small and was a bit out of reach.  Just looked like tiny splinter maybe like 5-10 mm long.

So I finallt decxided I'd give it a shot in removing it, took a little knife and poked at it a bit and saw it was definitely a ver a splinter, then grabbed it with a little pair of tweezers.  Got a nice grip on it and pulled it out and was shocked, it was a full needle tip.  The very end was bent so that was what I thought was the small splinter.  In reality, that was only the very end of it and it only looked like a splinter because it was covered in weed resin(the reason why I broke it off in the first place).  

I couldn't believe I didn't notice it go in really and I'm really glad I decided to attempt to remove it.  As for how it happened, I occasionally break off the tips of my needles if something happens to them to make sure I don't stupidly try to use them later.

I used to have things & people in my life that I was genuinely passionate about before getting deep into opiates and I truly miss that. I have to say bye to /r/opiates, because I just can't look at the dope porn & constant talk without caving in eventually. 

In high school, I was a determined athlete & have been fortunate enough to attend college my freshman year & participate in collegiate athletics, but resorting back into occasional heroin use eventually brought me back to square one, and it drives me insane that my full potential isn't being utilized. I think about it everyday, almost all day.

I was recently convicted of my second DUI within six months, put on probation for two years on top of a ton of bullshit community service/classes/fines.

Although I get a lot of shitty symptoms, the worst one by far is the nausea. I know opiate-related nausea is a popular topic, but I don't seem to be able to combat mine.

I've tried dosing on both an empty and not-empty stomach. When my stomach is empty, I end up violently vomiting up stomach acid, and when there's food in my stomach, I throw up all of it immediately. This happens literally seconds after I snort the dope, so it's been suggested to me that it could be a psychosomatic response. Just the smell of the dope going up my nose can trigger me to puke.

After throwing up initially, I feel nice and high. It's true, if you gotta puke, just puke. It makes me feel immensely better! But then say I'm only high for a few hours. Not days, not weeks, nothing like that. Just a few hours. As soon as the dope starts to wear off, I feel ridiculously nauseous, making it near impossible to eat until the feeling completely goes away. I've looked into opiate nausea a lot and was wondering how to best combat this immediate psychosomatic response, as well as the nausea that bothers me later into my high.

About an hour or so ago I did my shot from a new stamp called ""Instagram"". It was kinda smeared and spelled wrong and looked more like ""Onstagram"". Typical light blue Philly stamp bag with black ink. 

Ok, I did one bag. I remember taking the needle out and feeling the rush kicking in. Good amount of pins and needles. As the rush was building I went to grab a cigarette and that's the last thing I remember.

My husband hit me with the Narcan. He said as I was trying to get my smoke my eyes were closed and then my hands and arms started to shake a lot and I was unresponsive. He said I was shaking and would not wake up. So he grabbed the Narcan Tracey had sent me along with the big 22g needle. He gave me about three quarters of the little vial intramuscularly in my deltoid I think it's called. The area on my outer upper arm kinda in my shoulder area.

He massaged the injection area gently and after a few long minutes I opened my eyes. I was really confused and had no idea what happened. It seems he gave me personally a good amount. It was enough to save me and wake me up but not put me in withdrawals at all. I feel good actually. I'm just a little high, no nods. 

I'm kinda groggy though so please forgive me if I repeated myself at all in this post. 

My husband is still pretty shaken up and nervous cuz we now have almost no Narcan left. Tracey--is there any way you could send me another vial of Naloxone next time you get some? I don't need anything else. Please?

Thank you for reading and be safe you guys and gals. :)

They have been of all different sizes and demographics. Over time I discovered the wonder that is homeless people. Not only are some of them interesting as fuck, but virtually every long-term homeless person knows where to get that good-good. 

Every time I move into a new city, I make sure to talk/give money to the local homeless guys. This does cost me a little bit of money up front, but it's worth it in the end. There's always at least one who isn't (too?) crazy or mean: I focus my attention on them and become friends. Eventually I bring up drugs, and we talk about our favorites and tell some stories. The best was from an old 'Nam vet who did acid in the jungle: nothing happened, but he sure as shit thought something was happening! From there, it's really a small jump to get them to pick up for me in exchange for a dime or so of whatever their poison is. 

Just today I got .25 of some fairly fire diesel for about 40 (including my fee to my boy). This doesn't seem fantastic, but the fact that I don't have to pick up myself and the fact that any other source I've found sells 200 a g in this dry area makes it very, very worthwhile. The added benefit of making a new friend, albeit one that your roommates may dislike, is just icing on the cake. My current friend is just a nice guy with medical issues (and a taste for hard), but I've heard some amazing life stories in other areas.

Sure, I've been ripped off once or twice, but that's the game. I have a pretty good radar for people, and usually they bring up the idea of leaving collateral  when they pick up themselves. Letting your money walk is always nerve-wracking, but it's the price I pay for safety and convenience as a user with a lot to lose. 

The moral here: always be friends with the homeless people in your area. Not only does it make you a better human being, it helps you on this never-ending quest upon which we have all embarked. Stay noddy guys

I've been lurking on here for quite some time.  It's pretty awesome to find a group of people who don't judge as well.  I've done different lots of different drugs but IV heroin has always been a favorite but it seems most people I know IRL treat me as scum when they find out I use.  I'm thankful to find a group who gets it.  Thanks for that.  I've been using for about 3 years now and have seen the ups and downs of opiate addiction.  Currently, I'm involuntarily clean for the last two weeks because I moved to a different city and I don't want to make an eight hour round trip to score.

Anyways funny drug story.  A buddy of mine who I did dope with got into methamphetamine recently and wanted me to do some with him.  I am a downer guy and speed always does me dirty so I declined but he said if I did a shot with him he'd give me a half gram.  I declined but he ended up giving it to me anyways because well he owed me and I had never done it before. 

 So, we're at the park about to shoot up (dumb I know but well..you know) and I decided I'd bust out that baggy of meth and snort it after my shot.  In an effort to reduce the time of being in such a sketchy location to shoot we put our dope in the same container and cooked it.  While I was getting a cotton from my cigarette my buddy puts the meth in with the dope, we both bang it and lemme tell ya....IT WAS NUTS.  I remember jolting up because I down and the dope was bunk and I'm so pissed and...that's when it hit me that I did my first speedball.

About 3 days ago I picked up about half a g of BTH.

I proceeded to drive to a street that's not populated to try it out. This was around 7pm I parked,turned off my car and got my mini safe out and proceeded to do about .3 of what I picked up. After I did the shot I packed up my supplies in my safe and put it in my trunk got in the passenger seat and rolled down the window and listened to some music. 

Next thing I know I wake up to an ambulance next to my car. My doors open and the EMTs are just staring at me. I started to panic and noticed my keys were gone and then looked at my hand that had a iv line in it and I started to ask what's going on.

Come to find out someone walked down the street and noticed I wasn't breathing and there was a fire station around the corner so they told them the situation and they came to my vehicle and hit me with narcan to get me up, they said I was purple and wasn't breathing..

They then asked me if I needed to involve the police and I said no and in return they wanted my license information. So I gave them some basic info (not a real name or address) and when PD pulled up the EMT sent them away. They asked me to hop in the ambulance to take out my iv line and then asked that I lock my car and walk home.

This whole experience is weird and has really made me think of what happens when we die, like I felt nothing and it was an hour from shot till narcan and supposedly I wasn't breathing for a few minuets it was fucking surreal. I felt stupid and ashamed even though I didn't go to jail or get in trouble its fucked me up knowing how stupid I was. 

Has anyone been through something like this that can give me some insight??",1408598085.0

They were dried properly, but I stupidly decided to wring them out and shoot them. I got two different shots ready and forgot to cook one of them out of excitement and realized this after the shot was over. I waited an hour to see if I got the cotton fever, but didn't. I had also had some shots of liquor before I found the cottons. Stupid to mix the two, I know, but it seemed like a good idea at the time. But as I was going to bed my teeth were chattering a little and when I woke up, I felt kind of like shit. I got to work and had to sit down and take ibuprofen for a killer headache and what felt like a fever because I kept going between hot and cold with chills in the middle that made my arm hair stand up.

I was feeling so much better yesterday than today during this withdrawal. My neck is so sore, I drank 44 oz of water and 32 oz of soda today and only peed once, but that also might have been because of the drinking last night and I've drank every night since the withdrawal started because it helps me sleep and I pee very little after a night of drinking. But I'm also a little light-headed, but the fever is at bay with the help of ibuprofen. I just am worried I have sepsis. If I still feel shitty or shittier in the morning, I'm going to the doctor to explain. I just wanted your guys opinions on this. How rare is it to get sepsis from old cottons? I just don't want to die. I was getting clean after using off and on for about a year and ruined it by shooting those cottons. 

(Edit: I should also add that I'm having a bit of abdominal cramping but I don't know if it's from the withdrawal or not.  Also a bit of chest pain. I didn't eat all day and when I finally did eat about 45 minutes ago, my stomach started making a whoooole bunch of noises.)",1408592487.0

2e54iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2e54iw/iv_troubles/,2,https://redd.it/2e54iw,ClashOrCrashman,IV Troubles,"Ok so what I'm about to describe happened to me once a couple of months ago and just happened to a good buddy of mine earlier tonight.

After registering, the plunger was pushed down slowly. For me, about 3/4 of the way done with my shot a sudden sharp very painful sensation filled my hand (which was where I was shooting). The feeling was literally identical to if I had poured boiling hot water on my hand; it just had such a strong ""hot liquid"" feel to it.

The pain gradually dulled and the area became very swollen. For a couple of hours, I could not make a fist with my hand. The pain was over in about 3 hours, but the swelling took about a day and a half to go down all the way.

My guess was that I had hit an artery. A friend of mine kept insisting that I missed, but I've missed plenty of times and never experienced anything like this. She insisted that it was just a ""really bad miss then,"" which I really didn't have a response to. That's not what this was I'm sure. I figured, in the hands there is a higher risk of hitting nerves and arteries, so I must have hit one of those.

The thing that has me a little confused though is the shot my buddy did tonight. His was right in the crook of the elbow, which as far as I know is the safest place to shoot. I asked him a few questions like ""Was the blood bright red?"" and ""Was it hard to push the plunger down?"" because I have heard that those are signs of hitting an artery. He said no, that everything about it seemed normal when he registered. 

So my question for all of you fine drug (ab)users is, what the hell happened? I know you guys aren't doctors and all, but I would like to maybe figure out how we caused this to happen and do whatever we can to prevent it, because this experience really sucked major ballsack. Seriously, while not the most painful thing I've ever experienced, it's definitely up there and the swelling made my hand feel like it was gonna split open. Not good.",1408587195.0

Well… the first few days, I was a new person. Very little pain and needed only 1-2 Percocet toward the end of the day (I sort of overdid the physical activity). My nurse practitioner said that it's pretty common to need to swap the patches every 48 hours instead of 72 hours, so that may need to happen. The doctor stated that I was ""on the border"" between 25 and 50 mcg, so he erred on the lower side. The NP wants me on Opana IR or hydromorphone IR instead of Percocet for breakthrough pain.

Actually, I didn't really, but that's the way SHE felt. I was more worried about getting heroin everyday than I was about spending some real time with her. Then, next thing I know, two years have gone by and she's breaking up with me.

Losing someone I loved like this Is causing me to see that I need to quit. I've almost convinced myself that since losing my girlfriend to this shit, that I am ready to endure the torture that is quitting heroin. 

Then my cousin, the one I grew up with as a child, decides it's pertinent to kill himself. He blasted his brains against the ceiling and let his wife find him.

And then I go back to thinking that heroin is the only thing keeping my mind right, it is the only thing keeping me from doing what he did now. Heroin is the only thing keeping all that pain at bay. I have to grieve for my lost love and my lost friend sometime, but thanks to heroin that time IS NOT now - thanks to heroin I can actually get up this morning and prepare myself to go to work like any other day, like nothing is wrong.

Here's a song that I can't seem to stop playing. It's slowly enlightening me with clarity. Hopefully it will bring clarity to someone else other than myself. Give it a listen if you haven't heard it already.

In case I can't bring in chewing tobacco I am thinking about buying a E-cig/Vape Pen.  Just a cheap one to use while I'm in there.

Has anyone ever used one of those NJOY vape pen or NJOY liquid's they sell at 7-11?  Do you think it will be sufficient for me?  If you have used one before, can you tell me what is good, what is bad, whether or not you liked the NJOY brand vape pen.  If the NJOY brand liquid is any good or tastes like shit.

I've taken speed for just as long (ritalin,adderal) but never enjoyed it as much as all the different types of dope and ganja. Never really cared for benzos but Im sure Ive fucked up my GABA receptors with alcohol. Anyways, I did good ass, glass grade methamphetamine for a month straight, knowing its supposed to be one of the most addictive drugs, and never got addicted. I also smoked crack twice and never cared to do it again. After doing a month on meth I woke up one day and just decided I didn't really like it. I stopped, didn't miss it, didnt experience withdraw, didnt crave it and have never taken any kind of speed since. It just wasn't worth the comedown and I hated the fact it constantly made me have to pee. Why does my brain favor depressants over stimulants? I know people just the opposite. Note that I was on suboxone during this time and drinking heavily (not sure if that had anything to do with this but i felt it was worth mentioning.) My brother, on the other hand, who has add and a mild case of aspergers, would fuckin smoke meth with me and go take a nap. He would get tired as shit from speed and never liked to take his ritalin. I however, got all the classic side effects. What is the mechanism of action for amphetamines? Im not condoning meth, crack or any other addictive drug use, but could it be that these addictive drugs are not necessarily addictive as theyre made out to be? Or could it be that certain brains more susceptible to getting addicted to certain substances over others? Has anyone experienced anything similar? ",1408729150.0

I'm mostly just curious, not really concerned at all.

So I've never had withdrawals before, but I've been using a bit more frequently than usual in the past week or two, and curious to know if this minor headache I have right now is just some super small withdrawal symptom. The only reason I ask is because I don't tend to get headaches, and it feels pretty much exactly like a caffeine headache, but I've had my caffeine for the day already.

And related question: Just for future reference, what does a very minor withdrawal feel like? I've read enough stories on hear to know what a full-on withdrawal is like, but it'd be good to know what the minor withdrawals feel like so I can catch myself before becoming physically addicted.

And yeah, I realize that *real* withdrawals are terrible and this is absolutely nothing. Just a little curious.

2efxrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2efxrx/going_to_detox_monday/,38,https://redd.it/2efxrx,Spicy_Mango,Going to detox Monday,"Hello, this will be my first time detoxing.  I don't think it will be too bad,  I smoke about 5 points a day, sometimes more.. usually never over a gram.
I have a detoxing plan that I put together based on information I have found here in the sub and from other internet drug forums, so I'm not coming here to ask questions in that regard.
But! Tips are very welcome.
I'm looking to get some recommendations for some good films. I plan on just locking myself up in my room for a week binge reading, chain smoking and having movie marathons.. maybe this could be fun... lol?
Some movies I like are Fear and Loathing, The Big Lebowski, The Fisher King, The Birdcage... anything with Robin Williams, anything by Lynch and uhhhh, I have watched so many amazing movies but when put on the spot to name my favorites I run a blank.  I love quirky movies with quirky characters. I'm into horror but I think for detoxing I won't get more intense then a good psychological thriller... and I do love those, ones like Jacob's Ladder and Fire Walk with Me.  I want to watch movies with minimal to no drug use... no heroin junkies!!!  Also I'm having some hard times with my companion so maybe keep the romance turned down.  I like animated films and am interested in getting into some anime.

I thank you in advance for your suggestions, they are all welcome!

Oh and if anybody here has detoxed from smoking heroin not slamming could you give me a preview of the w/d symptoms.  I've been reading so much info on symptoms from injecting but none on smoking, I know it's not going to be as intense but I'm already feeling like shit in the morning, so achy, fucking hot/cold.. waking up in my own stinking sweat in the middle of the day with the sun beating down on me and my legs and back hurting to the bone is not the good feels but what gets me is the depression.  That isn't going to go away after detox, that's what I'm afraid of, I fell so hard for heroin so fast because I was suicidal and it stopped the pain for a bit but now it has become a burden and I don't have the money to keep on using.  I could have saved up to travel to south east Asia, a trip I have wanted to do for a long time.. but no I'm just sitting in bed, using drugs, wasting away... going into debt.... I have even considered sleeping with people for cash to support my habit because my other job doesn't pay enough... I don't want it to come to that, I want to get off this ride before it gets to that.
But it's fucking hard.. and I only have a couple people to talk too, like a couple, literally...2.  And one of them is my partner  and I want to stop bothering him with all my depressive bullshit.   I'm scared I am going to push him away but fuck it's hard to pretend to be ok.
Sorry for the rant.. people probably won't read this but I believe writing your feelings down as cheesy as it sounds is good for the head, so this isn't in vain. 


I wish all of you the best of luck if you are trying to detox.  You are strong and worth it!  It's easy to forget that,  I know.. But if you are like me and don\t have much support, WE GOT TO BELIEVE IN OURSELVES, because who the fuck else will??
Much love to all you broken damaged and crazy emotional unstable fuckers, we can get better.   

Update:It's Wednesday and I ended up calling my dealer.  I should have deleted his number from my phone.  I feel like trying to detox at home is futile.  It's a bit of a party house and there are always people here and I just want peace and quiet and not have people wondering why I have just locked myself in my room (only a couple people know about my problem)  I made sure I had no money on me but when my boyfriend came in to check on me and asked me how I was I got frustrated because I was feeling like complete shit, bed was sticky with sweat, sore legs that won't stop moving around, insomnia (Xanax isn't even helping), he then asked me if he could get me anything and I ended up punching my computer because I know the only thing that's going to make me feel better can't be bought from the store. Then he threw $60 at me and told me to get what i needed from the corner store..... What the fuck does he think a drug addict is going to do with $60...... I feel defeated, hopeless.  I feel like to went into this ill prepared and that I should look into government funded detox centers (I live in Canada).. I was on the third day btw",1408886918.0

Ive used oxycodone in various forms and preparations maybe a dozen times. When i started off like half a year ago, i used between 40 to 60mg at a time and that was without any previous opioid experience.

Weirdly enough, those doses did almost nothing to me. If i was lucky id get a bit drowsy and itchy. Nauseous too. Maybeee a little bit relaxed. At one point i actually got an acceptable high that left me all positive and nodding.

Now, six months later, ive got some oxy again. Im using approx 15mg every time and it seems to relax my limbs a bit. Other than that it makes my head feel heavy and sort of tipsy like. Its all very subtle, i gotta focus to feel it. Once, it made me really euphoric and such. But so far not really any of that opiate goodness, no 'warm fuzzy blanket' or whatever.

If i bump my dosage up to 20mg i seem to get uncomfortably sedated, nauseous and anxious. No mood lift at all. What am i doing wrong??? Is it my mind set? Could it be that if i forced myself to enjoy that uncomfortably heavy sedation, id actually feel right? Why am i not getting high?

I'm a 6/7-year oxycodone/heroin junkie.  Started with the hydros and knew I was hooked the first time, driving around my neighborhood in an total daze.  It's been high times since then, with heroin becoming more and more available lately and the only way to satisfy my itch without going bankrupt like I was with OC.

I'm becoming more and more of a reluctant user, so I avoid /r/opiates as it is definitely a trigger.  I try to only spend about $200-300 a week on dope, and deal with withdrawals once in awhile just to keep my mind a little more clear.

Anyway, I guess I hadn't spent more than a few days withdrawaling without caving in awhile, and I did not know that my withdrawals were getting this bad.  Normal crawls / shocks / chills / runs, but this time its borderline unbearable, has been lasting longer than I expected (symptoms still pretty strong on day 2) and I've been going through my options.

The shitty thing is that I'm currently in INDIA for work for two weeks, so I have ZERO access to anything that would normally help.  I'm in a pretty remote part of a very Indian city with access to only standard hotel amenities (food, tylenol, etc).  I could go into town and peruse a pharmacy; if anyone knows if I can pick up a benzo or opiate in an Indian pharmacy, please speak up.

Anyway I'm sitting in my hotel room, listening to music to pass the time, and basically passing out for about 20 mins at a time just to wake up and go back to being in pain.  And I'm crapping like mad, mostly because of the dopesickness but also my abrupt change in diet.

I then remembered that my travel doc prescribed me an antidote for the runs, and I figured I can at least control one of my symptoms, right?  So I look at the bottle and it says Diphenoxylate.  Hmm.  Haven't heard of that before.  So I look it up online.  You guessed it: it's a motherfucking OPIATE, that crosses the BBB.  I've been sitting on a little withdrawal antidote this whole time!

The diphen is coupled with Atropine, which is an anticholorigenic so it will fuck your week up if you try a recreational dose.  I've been popping one or two at a time every few hours (FAR less than the heroic doses needed to nod or feel the side effects of the atropine.)  So I'm not high, but my withdrawals are ALL BUT GONE.  This has truly saved my trip.

I've read that Immodium will help your w/d's.  The runs are the one art of w/d that's actually fairly bearable to me, but apparently these light opiates will help with other symptoms as well.

2edhbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2edhbn/5_levels_of_drug_use/,44,https://redd.it/2edhbn,h3xpl01t,5 Levels of Drug Use,"*I'm just going to preface this post by saying this is just a hypothesis I have based on the types of people I've met. It is in no way definitive or flawless, or even endorsed by the medical community in any way. Just my opinion on complicated subject.*

So through my experiences with drugs and drug users, I've come to 5 basic categories that people fall into when it comes to drug use (although this model is mostly aimed at opiate use). If you would, take a look and see if there's a group that I'm missing or if you think any of them could be grouped together. Or if you think its a decent model let me know. Thanks!

**1. Non-User**

Pretty self explanatory. Someone who doesn't use drugs or has very limited experience and knowledge on the subject. Smoking weed once or twice with your friends in high school doesn't make you a drug user. Maybe has a beer every now and again while watching the game. Basically a boring straight-laced average person.

**2. Chipper**

Someone who uses on occasion. Not more than twice a week, and most likely when with friends. It matters not which drug they use (hard or soft) or how many drugs they use, just so long as their use is not a day-to-day coping mechanism or a huge focal point of their life. Very likely to use middlemen and friends to obtain drugs, and probably pays a bit extra due to that. More educated on drugs than the Non-User, but not to the point of memorizing sections of Taimapedia and Erowid for future use.

**3. Habitual User**

Someone who uses on a regular basis and is cognisant of their use. Probably someone who plans on being a long-term user of their drug of choice. May engage in drug binges followed by dry periods. Has adapted to functioning under the influence of one or more (or possibly multiple at once) drugs in day-to-day life. Unlikely to steal to support their habit, probably holding down a job or two. Maintains a level of self-control not exhibited by an Addict, but much less so than the Chipper. Probably a wealth of memorized knowledge and first-hand drug experience for other friends who are less experienced. Probably engages in relatively safe routes of administration and practices harm-reduction. Most likely suffering from a mental disorder that they are self medicating. Does see a future for themselves, but may not see a future without their drug of choice. Their use either does not or minimally impacts their life and loved ones.

**4. Addict**

Someone who uses at an unsustainable level and most likely is aware of it. Use impacts day-to-day functioning and ability to handle responsibilities. Life revolves around obtaining drug of choice and maintaining buzz as long as possible, or alternatively planning for withdrawal. Lacks significant self-control when it comes to their drug of choice, and will most likely involve themselves in risky or poorly-planned situations if it means they will possibly get high. May or may not be involved in other non-drug related crime to support habit. Most likely knows their use is unsustainable and makes false promises to quit often. Has most likely isolated themselves from old friends and family unless they are aiding them. May associate with people they dislike due to mutual need to score. May or may not engage in harm reduction and safe routes of administration. Almost certainly suffering from a mental disorder, which may or may not be exacerbated by use and lifestyle. May be in a cycle of despair with little hope for a future. May or may not have a job or regular living space.

**5. Recovered Addict**

Someone who was once an addict, but is not currently engaged in that lifestyle. Most likely maintains sobriety to avoid falling back to being an active Addict. If they do still use, its most likely a controlled amount once every few weeks. Probably attended a rehab and may or may not be on a maintenance drug such as Suboxone or Methadone. Is most likely relearning to live life, probably has a job and living space. Most likely still struggles with cravings (either occasionally or often). Probably very educated on drugs and use, both from learning and personal experiences. May offer advice to current Habitual-Users and Addicts, and may discourage Chippers from continuing their activities. Recognizes that while their period of active Addiction may not be currently occurring, that it will always be a part of them. May or may not abstain from other substances to maintain sobriety from their drug of choice. Most likely seeking help for other issues that may have been ignored or masked during active Addiction.",1408811095.0

I'm there. My wife is, too. I've considered the local methadone clinic. They're within a half hour's drive, and it's about $15 per day. I don't know what the requirements for admission are, but this seems like a feasible option. Personally, I feel that subs work better for me, but with zero health insurance I don't see how this could be a feasible option for my situation. Then again, I don't know what the costs would be, though in sure that it's less than we spend on dilaudid. 

Inpatient isn't an option (we both work a decent amount, and currently neither of our jobs give us an opportunity for paid time off and we aren't making ends meet as it stands) and after looking into their methodology, I don't feel that a 12 step program meets our needs, personally. 

My concerns are as follows:

My wife is employed by a medical professional who has admitted to running the names of people she knows through the prescription database to check for opiate or other pharmaceutical addictions. The job is off the books so she has zero guarantee of employment, especially if she were discovered to be an iv user. 

The second issue is future pain management. It seems counterintuitive, I know. However, she has a number of relatively severe back problems, and she's concerned about what sort of treatment she would be able to receive after being put on methadone or suboxone maintenance. Not just the very likely chance that she wouldn't ever receive any helpful painkillers, but also the fear that her condition wouldn't receive the serious level of care that it requires due to her being labeled a drug seeker. 

Obviously something has to give, but she doesn't feel that it's fair for me to go and receive treatment for my addiction in a situation where she feels that she can't, unless she's allowed to continue using. Obviously this won't work, because I'm serious about quitting, and if I took the initiative to get into a treatment program, I couldn't risk having someone so close to me using around me every single day. 

I don't know what I'm looking for, but this community has a hell of a lot more experience and insight into how maintenance treatment and quitting in general works, and what other options or points of view we might have available. South Florida area, because I know location has a lot to do with available treatment options.

Even then it was still a few thousand, but I could afford it, and a few thousand was worth it I thought to show friends and family that I was serious about getting help, regain their trust, learn some things about myself and fight some internal demons, and hopefully come out a better man with a toolset to use for staying clean. (yeh in reality the rehab was a piece of shit, I relapsed the day I got out, but that's besides the point)  

Well months later and this supposed reimbursement from my insurance never showed up. I call them up and am like wtf and they tell me - they fucking tell me - oh whoops insurance won't cover your stay after all! Now pay 100% in full!!

GOD DAMN pissed and I have no idea what the fuck to do now...
The fucking incompetent bitch - who when I was in rehab told her that it was very, very, *very* important to make sure that my insurance covered this place (since I can't use the phone myself because it's one of their retarded-ass rules) - told me that yes insurance will cover 75%. God fucking damn incompetent bitch. In fact all the staff probably had double-digit IQs and I'm not even exaggerating.

Here is my question: I would really like some Dilaudid instead. I have been taking blues for a long time, and I am getting very tired of the same oxycodone high. I do enjoy GOOD QUALITY heroin a little bit more, but I do not want to put up with the inconsistent bullshit and the dealers and all the crap that comes along with the illegal drug trade. So Dilaudid seems to be the bets choice. Plus,. who doesnt love dilaudid?
Here are my questions: Is a doctor more or less likely to give out 150 8 mg Dilaudid than he is say, 150 30 mg oxycodones? Keep in mind, most of his patients (95% and above) will be getting the oxycodone. And 2) Is a pharmacy less likely to fill Dilaudid than Oxycodone? I know Dilaudid is some of the most powerful shit out there, right below oxymorphone. Oxycodone is a very common script, and pharmacies might be more comfortable giving it out than Dilaudid.

I still go to class, get good grades, but I feel ***no*** enjoyment from any of my daily activities (except getting high). While I am currently keeping withdrawals at bay with 10 - 20mg a day of OC (I was pretty steady at 50 - 100mg a day, every day), I want to enjoy life again. 

I guess my question is this:
does anyone else deal with this at such a young age? I am 21, but I don't feel mentally equipped to deal with this elephant in the room. I started to, and use, opiates to control my consuming depression, but I also suffer from OCD and that ""tells"" me to stay away from doctors and the hell that is SSRI dependence. Honestly, my mother was extremely religious during my early childhood, and she would not allow me to be diagnosed with ADHD, and this means that I have to risk jail time to acquire something that makes me feel normal for a few hours. 

Anyways, I am off to class and will read replies when I return. I love all of you, and I just want to feel love and emotion again (I've been in a void for a long time, but the void consumed me earlier this year when opiates became my outlet for happiness and enjoyment in life).

let me tell you that during rehab i went to a psych ward in ct and it was the worst painful experience of my life going through physical and mental withdrawls and i wish it towards no enemy of mine.

the least i can say is ive been almost 5 months sober and im on 24mg of suboxone. it truely saved my life and if ANYONE I MEAN ANYONE needs to talk to me pm me or comment below if you need help. i know exactly how some of you feel. so feel free to share your experiences of getting clean or trying to get clean.

The first time I did dope was snorting it and I can honestly say that I have never had any urge to try shooting. 

Everyone says that the rush is unbeatable and you get more out of your dope because of the higher BA, but the fact is you will just end up using as much if not more than you did when you were snorting. I don't really care about a rush and don't like nodding so snorting is perfect for me. The other thing about injecting is that everyone I know that has started doing it has had much much worse withdrawal symptoms. That makes sense because you're getting more into your system and growing dependent on a higher dose. 

I have been told by everyone that knows I do heroin (whether they use or not) that injecting was inevitable and snorting will eventually not be enough. For the first 2.5 years I kept from saying that I will never inject, but a little while ago I figured that I can honestly say that I will never inject. I have been offered a filled rig a couple times and have either said no or if I was really hurting, I just emptied it out into a spoon and snorted the liquid. 

I'm not trying to gloat or brag here, I'm just curious if anyone else has lasted as long as I have. I know a couple other I have spoken to have but not many. I guess I'm just lucky that I don't have the urge to get a rush or nod out all the time.",1409166633.0

I ran from my troubles,

to put up between,
My self and all of them,
So I couldn't be seen.

The world was looking in,
As I was looking out,
The veil wasn't working,
As I'd soon found out.

It was facing the wrong way,
In back at me,
The world was watching,
But I couldn't see.

I lost touch with love,
And all who have it,

A different kind,
Like needle tips.

Inside her arms,
The safest place.

No longer see,

Of her gorgeous eyes,
Shining blue.

An oasis of brown,
Drained to Silver,
I'll never know,
Where I missed her.

They told me it would consist of Fentanyl  + some sort of memory drug.

&nbsp;

**My questions are:**  will it work on a recreational opiate user?  How apparent would drug abuse be to the doctors?  

&nbsp;

My habit consists of a few bags a day.  A more precise measure -- I got a solid high from fifteen 5mg hydros a few days ago (via CWE. So calm down if you were already thinking it)

&nbsp;

**ALSO NOTE** - I think I am already somewhat resistant to IV Sedation.  
I had an upper GI a number of years ago (when I was not using opiates at all), and I woke up and remembered almost everything.  Doctors didn't believe me until I could tell them a number of specific details about what was done and even said (a joke in particular) during.  

The same goes for my wisdom teeth many many years ago (and even more opiate naive).

So maybe I am already somewhat resistant?",1409293575.0

Like most of you, I have two Reddit usernames: one for /r/opiates and other drug-related subs, and my main one that I use for everything else. I couldn't remember which one I had posted it on, so I dig through this handle's history first and what I found nearly made me fall out of my chair laughing.

Well apparently, I was browsing the Ask Reddit sub and opened up a post titled, ""What is the most BS sounding, true fact that you know?"" when I nodded off. I replied to one of the top comments (in a post with 3,489 upvotes mind you) which stated that there is a swimming pool named after a man who probably drowned, and got a bunch of downvotes.

The reason why might seem obvious - that what I typed was nonsensical. But of course, I couldn't be so lucky. No, the reason I was downvoted was because the two letters my drooling, opiated dumb ass somehow managed to type and hit submit were ""fg"". So everyone thought I was calling OP a fag.

Today sucked dicks. Long story short I was smoking on some horse in the bathroom at work today. So I was probably in there about 10-15 mins when all of a sudden the fucking smoke alarm goes off. I seriously would have shit my pants if they weren't already down. I jumped up, wiped my ass and stuffed my shit in my pocket. I tried to get out of there before anyone noticed but as soon as I walk out BOOM there's the boss.

He asks me what I was doing in the bathroom, I say nothing - it just went off. What he said next...worst feeling in the world. He said "" I think  you were smoking dope in there, your eyes are red and your pupils are tiny. Lets go to the clinic and get you a drug test. I am going to come with you.""

I knew I was fucked and my heart dropped. He wanted to come with me to the drug test place so I couldn't take a pit stop and get some fake piss. I basically just said fuck that, and walked out.

Now I'm out a job, have no fucking money and my last paycheck is coming tomorrow. I just wanna fucking die... Oh and the worst thing is the horse I have FUCKING SUCKS. My main dude got roped up and he was basically the only dude I went through. Now I can only get this fucking weak ass dope that doesn't even get me high...FML!

***UPDATE*** Hey just wanted to say thank you everyone, I really appreciate the words on encouragement and shit. It really made my day when I was feeling like a real piece. But I took some of your advice and kinda tweaked it. I called the manager and scheduled an appointment to come in.  I thought about what angle I was going to use and I just figured fuck it. I told him that I was smoking on a vapor pen (tobacco) in the bathroom because I was so stressed. I told him a sob story about how I am not having a good time at home, and not getting enough sleep and super stressed out at work. When he asked me why I left when he accused me of smoking dope I said that I was worried because I had smoked a joint at a part when I was really drunk about a week ago. He seemed kinda skeptical but then he asked me if we could go to the drug test clinic. I had prepared for this and had my homie's fake piss in my chonies so I said ya lets go. So we go to the clinic and I do my thing. Then it was the waiting game. 

He just called me an hour or so ago and said that sure enough I only tested dirty for weed, but it was very minimal. He asked me to not smoke anymore weed but he asked me to come back on Monday! I am soooo happy I almost couldn't believe it.

I really wanted to thank you guys because seriously if it wasn't for you guys I would have just said fuck it and not even tried to get my job back!",1409281535.0

4) take some subs to stop the WDS
5) wait til sub where off, WDS kick in and repeat step 4. 

Eventually the WDS get less and less intense and you take less and less suboxone to deal with it, til eventually ur off of it.

I dosed around 7am, and I threw up around 8.  I'm worried that I may have thrown up some of my juice, but the clinic is closed now and will be until Tuesday.

What are the odds that some of my dose came up with my breakfast?  I tasted some of the 'done, but at the same time I do have a slight buzz from it (I just started recently, how long do people tend to get a buzz from it btw?).  Is there any chance some of it left my system and I may need to dip in to one of my other bottles?

Personally I think I need to be on a higher dose, and I'll be talking to my counselor about that on Tuesday.  Any help/tips would be appreciated!!

EDIT: To those asking, let me clarify.  I took 50mgs yesterday and I ended up going through minor withdrawals before the night was over.  Today, since I couldn't get mine raised (my counselor isnt there Saturday) I tried adding 10mg from tomorrows dose in my dose today.  However, I think I ended up taking too much cuz of the purging.  This is also the first time I have had a buzz.

I won't be doing anymore today, thx for the replies.  I'm gonna finished the dose I dipped in tomorrow, then take my scheduled 50mg properly on Monday.

So I took one percocet (u15 pill, 5mg/325mg, oxycodone/acetaminophen, prescribed for pain post wisdom tooth removal)
My expectations were in no way met, much to my releif honestly.
I was very much expecting extended numbing, really waking up and not being in pain again, alongside sleeping for longer than I usually do.
None of that happened. Understanding what the pill actually contains now, I suppose it makes sense that the pain releif wasnt very effective, but there is something that bothers me.

I took a single u15 around 730pm last night. I only slept five hours, which is about the usual for me. Upon waking up, the pain was still very prevalent. Because this was my first time dealing with opiates at all, I entrusted them to my partner to keep safe. I was very much expecting to *want* more after waking up, and indeed I experienced mixed results, as I asked her to give me one and a half for my next dose instead of the one labeled on the bottle. In my mind I wanted the pills to work, even though the results were rather poor. Fortunately she knew better, and I took 1000mg of acetaminaphen instead of another perc.

Obviously 1000mg is going to kill pain better than 325mg, which brings me to my point: Why was I prescribed this when over the counter tylenol is just so stupidly more effective. Before the operation I told the nurse who was explaining everything that I was uneasy about taking percocets, but she urged me that the pain, as the anesthetics from the operation wore off, would be so much that I would need at least one.

after 24 the swelling was down and it didnt really hurt to touch or anything just felt weird

normal after 72 hour except for a weird feeling down my forearm like there was liquid in my arm and i could feel it flow to my elbow if i elevated my hand, and to my hand if i elevated my elbow. this feeling continues to this day but its sa pronounced as it was and today the site of the injection is kinda sore/painfull.

im curious wtf i did to myself? any thoughts? im kinda scared.",1409348333.0

So for the past month I have been taking roughly 60 - 90 mg of roxicodone per day. I couldn't grab any today and it has been about 27 hours since my last dose. I'm having minimal withdrawal symptoms (hot/cold sweats, slight anxiety) but nothing too bad.  I have some 8mg suboxone strips that I got from a friend. My question is, despite having a moderate opiate tolerance can I still get high from suboxone? If so, how much should I take? Any response is appreciated!",1409341080.0

I was a chipper for a few years, very recently (month or two) started shooting and some things kinda went to shit. I live with my parents, and found my shit after suspecting something was up - dope, needles, the whole shebang. They freaked and want me in rehab obviously. 
Here's the thing - I have a career-oriented job that I really like and have the potential to do well in - my opiate use hasn't affected this in any way (yet - still always on time, boss loves me, etc.) I'm with a good firm that has a lot of potential. Because of this I've been able to convince my parents that sacrificing this for some kind of 30-day program would only depress me and make me want to use when I got out. I don't want the industry I'm in to know what's up because I have lots of connections there. 
I'm not naive, I know my addiction can only hurt me in the long run and am really willing to give outpatient a shot. The problem is the place we found is all about abstinence - no drugs (obviously), no drinking, the guy I talked to even wants me to stop fucking caffeine and cigs. Again, I know my problem is with dope, not a goddamn martini. I'm willing to quit (even willing to take some drug they want - not subs or anything like that - that just prevents me from getting high altogether). But my job is stressful as fuck and drinking is part of the culture, I want to be able to enjoy a drink without worrying I'll  be thrown into inpatient if it shows up on a test. Are there any outpatient options you guys know of that will meet me more where I'm at? I'll take a drug test every day if I have to but I want to enjoy a drink from time to time if I feel like it. If it helps I'm in the NYC area. Sorry for the rant!

TL;DR - anybody know outpatient programs near NYC where they will just focus on my drug addiction and not give me shit about drinking, smoking (cigarettes) and fucking coffee?? Allow me to dictate more what I want out of the program?

Please help if you can guys and gals, even if not from the area...I would really appreciate it so much. Thanks!!

Edit: I appreciate the responses guys. Also the drug I referenced above is called vivitrol, if anyone has experience with that I'd like to know what to expect - does it help with cravings at all in addition to preventing opiates from working?",1409338836.0

(X-post from r/drugs),"Hi! My past partner was battling heroin for about two years. They've been clean for a couple months now, but they still feel like crap. They've been depressed, also not working, and living back at home with their parents. They made it through the worst parts of the withdrawal, which for them involved not sleeping for days, and I was really proud of them for that. 
However, today they told me that they're still physically opiate dependent, because of how crappy they feel, and that they want to start taking methadone so that they can try to find a job and such again. 
Is this something that happens - starting methadone after being clean for months? Is it wise? Are they for sure still opiate dependent, or maybe just exhausted from depression and not doing anything?
