Every other weekend or so (sometimes more, sometimes less) I've had a 30mg roxy.  My rules were:

1. Never on weekdays (unless on vacation).
2. Never when I'm in a bad mood.
3. No more than 3/4 weekends in a row.
4. No more than 2 days in a row.

I also dabbled with Xanax, Klonopin, Dextroamphetamine, Valium, and the like.  But, with those, here and there throughout the week, but in small doses.  I was also a daily weed smoker.

Since I began, things in life got better.  I was happier.  My business improved.  Great relationship.  Yadda yadda.

I woke up one day and decided I was done.  I still have over 100 roxies, bars, and everything else in my safe.  That was a month ago, and I haven't touched since.  I'm not sure if I will or not.  But, in my current time and space, I'm 100% sober, off weed and pills entirely.  I don't miss it.  I have no desires to use ever.  In fact, the thought really turns me off.

Maybe I'll go another year.  Maybe I'll go longer.  Who knows?  BUT, it is possible to use recreationally without diving down under.  Just throwing this out there since all I read since I began was that by now I'd have lost everything.",1517501589.0

I immediately felt a lot of liquid beneath my mouth, and to my luck it was mostly saliva- not too much blood. I have a tendency to grind my teeth while I sleep, so this could have potentially been worse. My tongue is CURRENTLY REFORMING back into its original shape,  but for a while it looked like a piece of silly putty that had been malformed with a pair of scissors. The area of my tongue which received the most pressure from my teeth is extremely bruised, and had minor bleeding. My neck is stiff as a motherfucker, so I'm going to not learn my lesson, take some more oxy and go to sleep in my actually bed, so hopefully ameliorate some of this neck pain.

One of my friends was the only dude with a plug and I put in a a decent amount of research before I committed. I 

decided my dosage for first time would be 10mg‚Äôs and my girlfriend was gonna do 14mg as she has a higher tolerance to generally every drug regardless of its effect. We took it and felt amazing for a couple hours, I mean it was spectacular if everything has just stop and that was the only thing I ever felt I would be content. 

After 2-3 hours I couldn‚Äôt stand up from the nausea. I couldn‚Äôt even sit up, but I was determined to play video games and consequently I threw up a couple times. 

My girlfriend decided she wanted to increase the nod slightly as it wasn‚Äôt hitting her like it hit me because of her general tolerance so she took .5mg of a xannax and she had a great time.

 I realized the danger and the love for the feeling is one that I never wanted to be accustom to. I knew that if I became comfortable with it I would be addicted.

Over the course of 4 months we did it another 5 times or so. 3 times it was my friend‚Äôs plug, one time it was an OP80, I did the Coca Cola method and did 40mg of that. I noticed something strange, it didn‚Äôt feel the same as the other ones. I wasn‚Äôt as nauseous, it didn‚Äôt feel as good but it wasn‚Äôt making me sick. 

After mentioning it to my friend he talked to his plug who he was decent friends with and he said it was slightly cut with heroin. In my mind I knew that didn‚Äôt make sense, too expensive and too difficult. I needed a new plug and after a couple a days I found one. They were smaller than the other ones I got but after comparing online the other ones were significantly bigger than normal. I snorted a quarter of it, I felt nothing. I snorted another quarter and felt a slight high but basically nothing. 

I started talking to other people and found out they are fent pressed and because of that my tolerance to opiates are supremely higher than most beginner‚Äôs. 

My question is, is there anything I can do about this? It‚Äôs extremely frustrating but it could ultimately be for the better. I‚Äôm just upset as I can‚Äôt have that feeling again without going to a dangerous dose for a beginner. 

My gf and J  experienced a range of health concerns after every fake 30. Blood in pee, hangover the next day, hallucinations While high similar to MDMA Dreams, in and out of consciousness while high. Extreme nausea to the point we couldn‚Äôt stand 10 minutes into the high and couldn‚Äôt sit up with it having to throw up.

I don't wanna come across as a dickhead and ask him if I can buy his oxy from him, since he still might need it for his pain. But I was thinking about offering him $100 to get a new bottle for me after he didn't need it anymore.

Now a few weeks to go before surgery I reminded them of what they told me. They claim I don't qualify, but don't worry because I'll be able to get to the clinic anyways so all is well in their book. WTF. The whole point was so I wouldn't have to come to the clinic and could rest after surgery for a little bit.

The other Complete bullshit thing is that they said after 90 days of clean drug testing they will give me 1 day a week of take home medication. Well its been 90 days. So I should get my 1 day a week right? NOPE! I haven't gotten 6 urine tests. I've only had 4. Which btw is COMPLETELY FUCKING RANDOM AND OUT OF MY CONTROL. 

Fuck Methadone. at least I'm only at 23mg now. Hoping to get off Doctor Methadone's wild ride pretty soon. This drug would be fine if these clinics weren't borderline ran by such lying piles of human garbage.. or if we could dose in pharmacy's like the UK does....

When I banged this dope I would get crazy pain in my chest and all out of breath and sweating hard. It subsides after 30 seconds but at the time I felt like I shot up rando shit that was killing me.

I bitched at the dealer but of course the dude insists it's raw as fuck. He agrees to switch it out for some dope that was better than good. Another dealer (who I'm on hella good terms with)that definitely has a similar source called it devil dope and that he refuses to get the real stepped on shit. So I asked him if his supply does have purposefully bad shit or different kinds of dope or if they just have one version of dope they sell. He got weirded out and told me to never ask about his suppliers ever.

Well a few months go by and I holla at the first dealer. End up getting the devil dope. It is some kind of opiates cause you will feel well. Get it switched out but he tells me ""my bad I mixed up by bags.""

So it got me thinking he has different kinds of dope. He knows when he gets it then he's DEFINITELY selling it somewhere. But why have poisonous dope?",1517457147.0

Tan on the left, Grey in the middle, tar on the right. One piece of tar looks kind of lighter because it had just been ripped off the huge ball of tar he had. Wish I could have just snatched that shit and ran but I would have gotten killed lmao. One time he opened a whole jar fully of Oxys in front of my face and said ""damn I bet you wish you could have all these."" lmao fuck you

I'm sort of new to dope. Not sure which kinds are best for what and such.

My usual guy (as mentioned above) had the tar and tan until recently sold me some grey shit calling it ""china."" I thought it was but it ran on the foil and smoking did have some effect. but so did snorting. idk. Can someone help me figure out if this is #3 or #4 or what? It's really nice regardless. Probably his best product no matter how you use it. I don't think I've ever seen ""china"" or ECP in real life, so I can't speak on it. (Posting pics of all 3 types shortly!)

The tar is bomb, I like smoking it. but its easy to go through quickly. It's sort of brittle so usually ill do a few lines of It too.
The tan is okay, obviously #3 or freebase or whatever the term is. It's sort of looks like very light brown sugar. Can be snorted for longer but less intense effect than smoking.

I'm about to cop. what would you cop?

Edit: From the midwest if that helps. 
I copped the grey and tar but wanna know what you guys think because he's my go-to guy.
Also how do I go about anonymously posting a pic of it? I'd love to show it off.

I would also really like to know If this grey dope is actual #4 even though it runs on the foil.
I haven't seen many posts about grey #3/free base (are they the same thing?). It's usually tan. If the grey is #3, what are the BA's of intranasal vs inhaled? Can I use an Emergen-C packet with citric acid/vitamin C to turn it into #4? If so, can I just mix them together and snort them, or do I have to do It in water then snort the water? Could I make a nasal spray? Is there a way to isolate the citric acid and/or vitamin c?

Lastly, since the tar is brittle and easy to crush down and snort, does that make it lower quality? I usually smoke like 3/4 and snort the other quarter. Should I switch that around, skip snorting it, or skip smoking it? I assumed the intranasal bioavailability is stronger.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST. Can someone PLEASE explain the numbering system. I get #1 is a form of morphine precursor to heroin. I'm not sure what #2 is and if it is different than #3? Is BTH even on the list? Or is the system its so old it doesn't apply anymore?

###Earlier today...


As I'm sitting in my kitchen drinking a cup of coffee I get a text from Cliff.

  Cliff: Yo what's up?


  Cliff: Its emergency when r u off work?


  Me: ""What's the emergency? (to hell with telling him I'm home and off from work)


  Cliff: Nevermind, I'm just rying to flip my xanax.


  Me: Is that the emergency? Did you need me to deliver to a potential client?** (the part about delivering the xanax to his client is actually just me probing for more info)


  Cliff: Workin on it


&nbsp;

Two days ago Cliff said that he was trading his xanax for dope and I said, ""so that could take a day or two.."" He responded, ""no it should be tonight.""


He doesn't presently owe me any dope but there is an odd $20 on my balance sheet that he still owes me from the recent past. When he says that he's *working on it*, it is implied that he is going to share the dope that he obtains upon conducting the trade.


On more desperate days when I'm not sitting on subs, I'd be checking in every few hours, ""did you trade yet?"" It has been two days since he said it ""should be tonight."" 

I still can't say enough how happy I am that I'm not in need or counting on anything he says.


&nbsp;


###Later during dinner he texted...


  Cliff: Yo u at work? **Its important** man


  Me: I'm looking to eat dinner when I get home after 8. What's the emergency?  (It's a lie, I'm already eatiner dinner but I'd prefer him to think I'm not home just in case...)


  Cliff: Could you grab me a couple of 2 liter sodas that are 2 for $3? I'll compensate ya for it


  Cliff: **If I drink water again I'll die**


  Cliff: **Figured you could use a bump**


&nbsp;


Umm yeah, no. I told him I can't do it. What I love is that he's looking to compensate me with a bump. Is that a bump from a single pill? Perhaps he'll crush up two roxy 15mg's, snort some of it and let me get the remaining table scraps?


I'm tempted to ask what the definition of ""bump"" is in this context but I don't want to make him think that I'm remotely willing or able to buy his shitty soda. 

Anyway, his response to my not being able to get soda was ""Damn it"", so no hope of dope.. good thing I don't really care.

&nbsp;


###Recap: 


Cliff picked up his own damn Xanax on Monday because I made damn sure not to do the pick-up. In the past he'd ask me to bike to the pharmacy for him. If he didn't have any roxies to give me which he usually doesn't by that time of the month he'd entice me with a dream.


One time he texted, ""would you do it if there was a chance that you'd have something to do before work?""


Subsequent times I knew there was no chance that the benzos would get traded for dope before work but still held out hope that it would be handled by the end of my shift.


&nbsp;

He might've successfully traded benzos for a sharable amount of dope on one out of six times in the past few months. Each time I picked up the benzos I'd deliver them then wait and spend the day checking for status updates while Cliff would ultimately get barred out and nothing would transpire.


I found it frustrating because I would wonder to myself, ""how is this dude going to answer the phone for a prospective buyer if he's so barred out?""


&nbsp;


Well, this week has been great for me. I have enough subs to get me through pay day and beyond. By that point in time I will either see a doctor or get a bulk street discount through my own new connect. 


Either way, I am not buying dope next pay day. I am not buying dope and I am certainly not sharing or loaning any to Cliff. 


At some point when I see him or when he calls my phone he's going to ask what I'm looking to buy next week. Something like, ""How many buns on pay day?"" At that point in time I will have to disappoint him.


Perhaps he'll act like he understands and supports my decision but he'll more than likely try to talk me out of it. 


&nbsp;


My next posts will include:


* How Cliff reacts when I tell him that I am not buying dope on pay day next week.


* Dreams, motivations and aspirations. (Think Forrest Gump running across the country but with a bicycle)

I had a nasty back injury about two years ago. Long story short after trying a variety of painkillers my dr settled on morphine. I had a natural high tolerance and it took 80mg in the beginning to dull the pain enough to function.
By 6 months later I had stabilizes at around 200mg twice a day.

Keep in mind this was enough to dull the pain but not to do much mentally.

My ex learned of the doseage level I was on and, came to the determination that it was not acceptable even though prescribed by a very solid smart dr. And decided she was going to cause me a great deal of grief as far as my parenting time with my son went unless I stopped taking it.

So I saw another local dr who specializes in opiate treatment, as I wasn't too keen to suffer through withdrawal.

He suggested Suboxone, and it took 16mg to get me comfortable after 2 days of withdrawal.

I was trying to get off of it as soon as possible and 8 weeks later was down to 2mg per day, but my back pain was so terrible that I had to go back to 16mg to even make a bit of difference.

So that's gone up to 24mg over the past 2 years.

It hardly helps my back pain, has given me terrible headaches, I feel like I'm never well rested and wake 2-3 times per night and have a variety of other very undesirable side effects.

So I've spoken with the dr and asked about alternatives as I'm stuck with this injury for life.

What he basically said was fentanyl or hydromorphone would be the two options but he was concerned about tolerance and such.

Then he was recommended methadone.
My first reaction was as you'd guess, being as all I knew of it was the taboo and stereotypical view of it.

However after doing a fair amount of reading it sounds like it can be pretty great for severe long term pain. And I wouldn't have to go to a clinic or anything.
From what I read it's one of the best for long term serious pain.

Anyway as I consider my options I'd like to know what the transition from Suboxone to methadone would be like? Do you end up with any bad effects from stopping the Suboxone as I've heard horror stories?

How is methadone for side effects? As I've had a hell of a time with Suboxones side effects.

What doesage of methadone would a person have to take to switch from 24mg of Suboxone and to still help with pain?

Are there any side effects as far as energy, libido etc vs Suboxone?

I'd appreciate any firsthand knowledge and info possible.

1. Listening to Synthwave/Psychedelic Rock/EDM/Jazz/Reggae/Classical with a great pair of headphones/earbuds.

2. Walking into the supermarket, talking to strangers and making friends, and looking at all of the different herbal products. It's strange, I realize.

3. Playing video games that are RPG, or any multi-player game where I can chat with people using a mic.

4. Reading threads on Reddit and commenting.

5. Calling and messaging friends.

6. Nodding...

6. Looking at great artwork or reading a wonderful novel.

7. Ensuring my supply for the next week.

8. Going to planetariums! They can be nauseating, however, so DIPH or Ginger Root is good to have on hand.

As a side note, a great experience I had once was while I was very early into my opiates endeavors was on 20mg of hydrocodone and was driving (it was a road rarely frequented by others) along the beach around dusk staring at the sun setting over the ocean while listening to some great Pink Floyd. Will never forget it.

**1-20// More of the Same**

&nbsp;


Got high again today but I don‚Äôt feel too guilty. Smooth knocked on the motel room door at 9am to collect the money I owed him. I didn‚Äôt get much sleep due to what I can only assume was a prostitute in the room next to mine. From 3:30am until past 6am she would scream and moan loudly in the way only prostitutes and porn stars do.


I fronted a $20 off Smooth at 9am and managed to fall asleep by 11am. At 3pm I woke up and departed to collect my check and pay Smooth back.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

At this point I stop writing due to how rough I feel and continue to tell the story the next day. I‚Äôve taken Kratom and I‚Äôm smoking tons of weed with a house full of people in bay city for a smoke off. I feel good and want to write so I continue the story where I left off

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

It was the first nice day in awhile in Michigan. Most of the snow has melted and this decaying area seems to be absolutely glowing. I‚Äôm not high but I‚Äôm not sick either and it‚Äôs the closest I can feel to normal lately so I can actually appreciate the view. The beauty is almost too much to take in after the dull motel room and I have to put my head down briefly.


I know what Elliot Smith means when he said ‚Äúgonna walk, walk, walk, 4 more blocks plus the one in my brain‚Äù. The walk is 20 minutes but feels like 30. I run into Smooth and he tells me he took a hit of acid. In my experience whenever black people take acid it‚Äôs really funny and this rule once again proves true. I pick up my money without incident and pay back what I owe plus buy a fat $60 of some truly garbage dope. It‚Äôs pretty much a white trash dope fiend shit show after this so if you‚Äôre reading this expecting the diary of Anne frank you picked the wrong read.


I do the true dopefiend move of using a public bathroom to shoot up. Of public bathrooms places like McDonald‚Äôs are the least junky-ish in my opinion. I go to a cafe that has a bathroom key you have to ask for because people come here to shoot up. I buy a $1.75 San Pellegrino and not just because it‚Äôs what Patrick Bateman drank in America Psycho. It was the only water available.


The key is attached to a big tin mug and I feel stupid to be on such an obvious dope chase in front of all these nice college students. I try to make small talk with the cashier by complimenting his tattoos. For some reason I bring up prison and how the prison tattoo guy spelled my mom‚Äôs wrong and it is very awkward and cringe worthy. Sarah said I was high functioning autistic once and even though she said it was just meant to be an insult I always suspected she may have been serious. Maybe she has a point, but at the time none of this mattered. I had picked up a wet dirty cigarette butt from the parking lot because this reality is better than the nightmare of cooking up a shot and not being able to draw it up.


I put half of the dope in my cooker. It‚Äôs super light tan rocks that dissolves very quickly in water. I draw up using my disgusting cotton, register, and slam quickly. Despite being a large shot the effect isn‚Äôt much more than a slightly improved mood with that very little rush.


It did have enough of an effect to make me decide to go over to Brian‚Äôs trap house of an apartment. He had ripped me off a few weeks earlier but he has the best plug, Polo, and I consider asking him to cop for free to make up for what he owes me.


I foolishly buy another $20 of shitty dope from Smooth before entering Brian‚Äôs. Brian isn‚Äôt even there and it‚Äôs just Katy and two younger black crack dealers who I didn‚Äôt think I knew but one remembers me. He says he saw me overdose at the trap before and thought I was going to die. This is not the first time I‚Äôve heard things like this. I genuinely like Katy and kind of missed her. She‚Äôs gone from snorting to shooting heroin but her main addiction is crack. She asks me to buy a hit for us and since I‚Äôm using her house to get high this is etiquette. I call over one of the dealers and ask to buy a dime rock. He makes a minor show of acting like he‚Äôs doing me some huge favor because ‚ÄúI usually sell $20s, dog‚Äù.


I break the rock in half and prepare another shot of the shitty dope. I load the pipe with my rock and smoke it completely and manage to shoot my weak dope before exhaling a cloud of crack smoke that‚Äôs still so big after holding it in I know it‚Äôs going to be a strong one. The hit of crack was generous but nonetheless only $5 worth but it‚Äôs potent so I get a minor bell ringer. The cocaine is outperforming the heroin by a long shot and I don‚Äôt really feel much of anything from the heroin.


Brian returns and makes an apology and agrees right away to buy me 2 packs for $30. 2 packs would normally be $40 and I‚Äôd have to break him off one effectively making one pack $20. One pack is guaranteed to get me anywhere between ‚Äúplenty high‚Äù to overdosed. I putz around running to the store to buy single cigarettes and drinks. The dopeman Brian goes through, Polo, has drivers that deliver for him which is usually an indication of good quality product. He says 15 minutes and usually takes 30 but today he‚Äôs true to his word. So is Brian and he delivers me 2 untampered $20s of very potent dope. Even though we are both strung out I first feel respect for him making it halfway right. Then I see regret for ripping me off flash over his face in a genuine and unpretentious way. I am able to forgive him and go to get high on some good dope for the first time in a while.


Things blur and the night ends.

&nbsp;



**1 - 21// Return to Bay City**

&nbsp;



Today is Sunday so I‚Äôm going back up north to Bay City to see Sarah. She‚Äôs staying at the house of a guy she cheated on me with when I was locked up. The fact I put up with this says something about how much I love her, or maybe how pathetic I am. I pick her up and she is in a surprisingly good mood and lunch goes fine. I have purchased 3 bottles of Kratom to hold me over and they are doing their job but do not take the edge completely off.


Sarah wants to go to a ‚Äúsmoke off‚Äù so we call a ride from our friends Allen and Marcus. Sarah, Alex (Sarah‚Äôs nephew), Allen, Allen‚Äôs girlfriend, Marcus and I all pack into a tiny hoopty car that looks like it can barely drive. Due to all the weight the wheels are constantly scraping and I‚Äôm terrified of getting pulled over as I have warrants. We must have looked ridiculous, 2 people in the front and 4 people crammed in the back. Not to mention Sarah, who is a rather large girl, is sitting on my lap and has to lean her head down due to the car roof.

We swing by the house of an old Vietnam Vet who grows medical marijuana and I buy $40 worth of weed. I also buy Sarah some alcohol to improve her mood and make her tolerable to be around. We go to the house of an older, white, gang banger. If there‚Äôs one thing more pathetic and cringe worthy than a white gang banger its a white gang banger over the age of 30. Bay City is kind of a white ghetto and a lot of people here are white trash. Allen, his girlfriend, and Marcus are good people though.


More and more people arrive and it turns out I‚Äôm the only person with weed. I feel like Sarah used me since it‚Äôs always my money spent on weed. It hurts me that she cares so little about the money I have to work so hard for (I make $8 an hour) but I‚Äôm sure the thought never crossed her mind. There‚Äôs a guy there Sarah fucked when we were broken up, he‚Äôs older, drunk off his ass and has a crack pipe in his pocket. If this is one of the guys she sleeps with what does that say about me? I try to block it out of my mind. The conversation is local gossip and vapid bullshit so I decide to read my book. When there‚Äôs a group of people around I can‚Äôt get a word in with Sarah because she makes herself the center of attention. If I try to tell a story or comment on the topic she raises her voice or cuts me off, to be fair this rude habit of hers applies to everyone though. This used to upset me to no end but I‚Äôve grown used to it. Seeing how little she values my opinion or conversation does hurt though. In my head I call this the ‚ÄúSarah show‚Äù because of her tendency to hog the conversation and stand up during the long diatribes, usually about other times she got drunk or just plain old shit talking a person who is not there to defend themselves.


Sarah wants to smoke crack and tries to get some from a wigger for free. I text her angrily and tell her if she smokes it I‚Äôm leaving. Even though I haven‚Äôt remained sober I am trying and if she smokes crack it means I will too. I would never bring drugs around her when she‚Äôs trying to stay clean but I‚Äôve never expected this same respect from her, nor have I ever got it.



The chance to score some benzos arises so her nephew and I quickly depart to buy 30 Valium. Although she expects me to give her 15 of these for free she does not want to walk the 10 minute trip to grab them with us. I buy 20 of them and offer Sarah 7. She is not happy with this even though 7 Valium is a large dose and she didn‚Äôt pay for any of it. She throws a minor hissy fit and insists she won‚Äôt feel it at all‚Ä¶ even though she ends up being belligerent due to the mix of benzos and alcohol. The Valium takes all of my concerns and self esteem issues away and I feel human again. All I want to do is be quiet and spend time in my own world where the cares and stresses have melted away.




Time ceases to exist and my memory and consciousness only come in flashes. I‚Äôve taken 30mg of Valium and now I want to write again. I‚Äôm with Sarah and it‚Äôs going surprisingly well and my prospects of sex look pretty good. Getting and maintaining an erection will be hard and I will not likely be orgasming. At this point I take more Valium and I am near blacking out. I awoke to these notes on my phone


On 70mg of Valium sobbing gotta write notes before I forget. Sarah found journals and is done with me.

**Days Later**

&nbsp;


Sarah broke up and is now threatening legal action. I don‚Äôt know where to start. I guess it would be best to begin where I left off, but I took a lot of Valium and my memory is fuzzy of the period that follows. I met someone from Reddit. An Asian girl living in Japan (but formerly lived in America), it feels stupid to talk about this on something that people might read‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs a special relationship and I am hesitant to discuss it further.


**Update** *The girl and I have been talking non stop as of the current date (1/31/18). She‚Äôs amazing and means a lot to me already. I‚Äôm glad that reddit could introduce me to so many supportive people.*


Sarah went through my phone when I passed out from the Valium and read my private journals I had never published. She freaks out that I have written about her, even though nothing negative had been written and it was mostly all about how much I loved her and how much unreciprocated love hurts. She is yelling at me and telling me to call my Grandma to come pick me up even though it‚Äôs 3am. She threatens to hit me if I don‚Äôt give her 3 more Valium. I hold my ground and not just because I want the Valium for myself. I can tell that this is the real, permanent break up but for once it doesn‚Äôt break my heart. The girl I‚Äôve been talking to has made me feel like I‚Äôm worth being loved for the first time in years. Despite the insults being thrown at me I fall asleep smiling but deep down I know the Valium is partially the cause. I have taken 10 10mg Valiums at this point which is a big dose for me.

&nbsp;



**1 - 22// Grandparents**

&nbsp;



The next day I wake up still in a haze and have my family pick me up. Since Sarah has read my journals she saw I had relapsed and told my family. They tell me they‚Äôre not taking me back to Ypsilanti and I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. Home is death for me, the last time I was at home I overdosed twice in three days. I have a life, a job, and true friends in Ypsilanti. Thankfully I am able to convince my family to let me return and I only miss one day of work. I return to the crack motel on Tuesday January 23..


I have a good amount of money and make the poor decision to get high before heading to college. I am registering for late classes and need to take placement tests. I buy a few $20 folds of heroin through Brian and it is amazing dope. I ride the bus to school and manage to find my way to the testing center in my heroin daze. I can‚Äôt tell if the placement test is really easy or if I‚Äôm just dumb and it‚Äôs all going over my head. It turns out I get a perfect score and qualify for everything. For the first time in a long time I am proud of myself.


Like a true dopefiend I manage to parlay this success into a failure. Instead of returning directly to work I head back to Brian and Katy‚Äôs to get more dope. The dope and crack takes hold and I become ‚Äústuck‚Äù. Being stuck is when you start getting high somewhere and don‚Äôt leave until all the money and drugs are gone. I keep telling myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only an hour late, I can make an excuse that the test ran late‚Äù. One hour turns into two and eventually it‚Äôs 3am and I‚Äôve missed my shift completely. Brian and Katy begin arguing over missing packs of dope and it looks like it‚Äôs going to get physical. Plates get smashed and I decide to leave before the cops show up. I find out later the cops did show up but they didn‚Äôt answer the door. The walk back to the motel is cold and lonely but the opiates filter this experience into a pleasant one.

&nbsp;



**Wednesday 1 - 24// Addict Excuses and 3rd Chances**


&nbsp;


I know I am in trouble at work and I‚Äôm afraid to go in. I message the group chat with a bullshit excuse. I tell them the night before I left my phone at college then got on the wrong bus and had to walk 10 miles home and that‚Äôs why I missed work. I really doubt my co workers and managers believe this but they don‚Äôt call me out. I feel an incredible sense of guilt over lying to these people who have been so good to me, given me so many chances and shown me more love than people have in years. I want to change so bad and there‚Äôs nothing I desire more than to make these people proud. They took a chance hiring a drug addict felon and I‚Äôm letting them down. I won‚Äôt give up though, I will beat this disease. Despite everything they allow me to work but tell me one more no call/no show and I will lose my job. I resolve not to let them down like I do so many others.


I did not plan on sharing my journals with people I know in real life, but Sarah posts them on facebook to show everyone I have relapsed.
 I manage to stay off the heroin and only take Kratom. I don‚Äôt feel too bad surprisingly.

Secondly, this post is about Aunt Flow so boys probably want to stop reading now. 

I have been using for 4 years, and have kept a regular cycle except for months that I was stressed out. I didn't even know until reading on here that usage effects such issues. I snort, so I'm basically curious if the stopping of mother nature has to do with usage methods. Like if someone snorting has different effects than someone shooting? 

I've had times I was using a gram a day and still had my monthly visitor, so I'm doubtful that matters. 

I also know addicts get pregnant all the time so obviously they had to have been getting their cycle too, right? 

Probably sound stupid asking all this but this is one of the many things I've been pondering lately along with if its possible to mentally control withdrawals, using myself as a test subject so its probably a biased view. Curiosity kills this cat. 

Which reminds me since I'm known for my kitties on here, they are all doing extremely well. Not so much kittens anymore since its suspected one is about to make me a granmammy any day now.

I live about 3 minutes away from my local fire department so they were there quick. By the time they arrive it was clear what was happening so they hit me with the narcan that would pull me out of the od blackout for maybe 20 or so seconds in which I remember telling my dad and the emts what I took and how much. By this point I'm about 4 narcans in from the ambulance alone and another 2 when I get To the hospital. They release me after a few hours of monitoring with a fucking pounding fentanyl headache. The ride home from the hospital with my dad was the most awkward shit I've ever been through; on top of this I was wearing just boxers and I was brought a pair of pants that was my sisters sweatpants.

I think I just turned all the coke into crack!""","I still don't know what's up dudes impressively unpredictable ways of operation or the cello, but I'll get to that. I wanna tell you guys about this dude I've been runnin around with, I think he might be one of my favorite people to ever be squeezed out of a womb. We'll call him Bud. Bud is a big black dude with dreads, covered in tattoos and piercings with a pistol in his waistband and a Rasta handle buckknife on his side. He also has an enormous heart, I'd say the biggest heart I've ever found out here. Outside appearance may be intimidating, but as soon as he starts talking and his mannerisms come out he's just a teddy bear, the least scary guy in the room, you can't help but love him. He's a big drug dealer and sets an example with how kind, considerate and thoughtful he is of others. In regards to just brain processing he's kinda slow sometimes which can be hard to work with, but I wouldn't want him to change one bit. 

A few nights ago I was hangin at his place. He fell off his game super hard recently from one bad move that has his phone service off until paid for, he's stuck bouncing around people's hotspots so I've been helping him make some money. He was in the kitchen behind me preparing what I assumed was food. He recently traded all of his heroin for cocaine, I don't agree with that move but that's what we had to work with. He was doing fuck all in the kitchen and I sat on the couch chainsmoking cigarettes while using my phone to get him coke sales, occasionally setting it down to ramble to him about my stupid shit and stare at a TV in front of me with no chords or receiver. After a couple hours I completely forget about the prospect of prepared food and have some decent sales lined up when he shouts from the kitchen, ""OH NO! I think I just turned all the coke into crack!"" Are you fucking serious? He urgently asks me to please go get my little bags because now we have to bag crack rock, not cocaine. I go upstairs to get my bags, return downstairs and what do ya know, a bunch of crack has replaced the cocaine, sitting in a frying pan looking like a bunch of money about to go away. He claims he didn't think he would be able to do it right and what wasn't processed into crack would remain as cocaine, not be ruined. First of all Bud, it doesn't work that way but it looks like you did it right so good job I guess. 

The crack was sold off faster than I expected. So last night I'm with him in his room and we're dipping candy bars in a jar of peanut butter while planning out and setting up the moves we're gonna pull for the night. It looked like things couldn't get moving for an hour or so, I take this time to smash down the road to sell a couple legal items I had and take someone to a plug nearby and get him taken care of. I was gone maybe 40 minutes. 

Like 40 minutes absolute maximum. Probably closer to 30. That's it, that's all the time I was gone. A lunchbreak. 

And when I get back and walk upstairs into his room, he's sitting in there and there's just a big ass cello taking up the entire front wall. A god damn cello. He hasn't looked up at me from his phone or said a word, just typing. I look at the cello, then at him, then back to the cello, then him. 

""Um... is that a cello?""

He doesn't look up. ""Huh?"" 

""Is that... is that a cello?"" 

He looks up at me and then to the cello and smiles at it. ""Yeahhh, it is."" 

""Where the fuck did it come from?""

""Huh? Oh I don't really know."" Back to his phone. There's a 5 second pause.

""No. Bud, no. This does not just happen. Something occurred and it came from somewhere. Seriously where the fuck did it come from?"" 

He looks me dead in the eye, ""Bro, I really don't know. It wasn't here, and then it was. My theory is it's a gift from God so I can sell it and turn my phone service back on. Do you know anyone who would want a cello?""

""I... You know what I might actually. Let me ask around.""

I have someone interested in the cello, I'm bringing them to check it out tonight. While driving home last night I was just thinking about how weird this is and wanted to tell you guys. If you can't stay safe out there please stay smart, love ya.",1517597697.0

Now I use occasionally whenever I come home. Im from p****, but I tour all over the country as a tech for bands now which keeps me away from the shit. I dont NEED H, but I like to do it. Ill never do it more then two days in a row, and I'll keep myself from experiencing bad WD's (i believe that was my source of full-blown addiction).

Well anyway, I came home from a long run a few weeks ago. As usual I'm paid up and i wanna take a trip to the block. I usually run up and cop 6-10 bags and a few vials of crack (I enjoy that shit too). This block I've been going to has been consistent for YEARS. like, NOT fetty. Usually some up-to-par shit. I know myself very well, and know my limits. I used to shoot, but I cut that shit out and only snort it anymore. So anyway, I copped and took the subway back down to 30th st. I went in the bathroom there as usual and took a look at the bag i was about to do, i knew immediately that it was straight fent, you can just tell by the way it moves in the bag and the way it looks. So at this point i'm pretty dissapointed.

I do a half bag as usual, and the shits pretty fucking strong. Ive bought fetty before (on purpose) and this shit was way strong. (Ive had a high tolerance for years, even in periods of non-use i can snort or bang 1 bag of some fire dope and be chillin). I Decided to walk around for an hour or so because my train to w******** was cancelled.  finally get on the train and get to w********. My bus to ****** isnt for another hour and by now the legless fet I did had worn off. I went into the bathroom of the train station in wilmington. Did the other half of my bag. Next thing i know im awoken by EMS/12 in the bathroom.

I fucking OD'd on this dumb ass shit. by SNORTING it. the last time(s) i OD'd was over 5 years ago in my ""glory days"" but that was from shooting D. Of course Narcan/ETC/hospital followed. But im so fucking mad at this shit. Lucklily the cops were cool and didn't smack me with any charges.

P*** needs to step the fucking game up. All i want is some nice H, not this synthetic bullshit. FUCK fentanyl.

Lately she's been coming up with excuses to ask him for more coke than he already gives her. Here are some reasons she's asked him for more ""medicine""(coke).
1. She needs to write a important letter. 
2. Her back hurts.(claims she's had spine cancer her whole life bc she rode on a top secret CIA submarine)
3. She wants to go to sleep but can't without a line of coke. 
4. She has a headache. 
5. She needs to make an important phone call. 
6. She knows she needs to eat but can't without a line.
She of course never does what she claims she needs the coke to do. 

She's still crushing up and snorting tums and aspirin saying she ""metaphysically turned it into coke and heroin with her special brain because she used to be a pharmacist"". She's also still giving out to her husbands customers and telling them it's drugs. A friend of mine shot some of her mixture. He was pissed. 

A couple of nights ago my roommate, her husband, got into some Xanax with his usual heroin and passed the hell out hard. After an hour or so she started fiending for more ""medicine"". Since he can't be woke up she flat out tells me she's going to try to get his drugs out of his pockets. I'd caught her opening his bag of coke while he was passed out on the couch and left it in his jacket a few days earlier and woke him up by jumping up and asking what she was doing. She swore up and down she wasn't going to take any and was just getting it out to hand to him but this time she'd have to get his bag out of his pockets. She said she would tell him when he woke up exactly how much she took and he'd be ok with it (yea right). She said she would give me some and not tell him she gave me any when she told him but I said I wanted no part of it and advised against it. Well she tried anyway. It was sad seeing someone dig through their passed out husbands pockets to steal their drugs. I slick recorded her bc I figured she would try to blame me when he woke up to find his drugs gone since I'm the new person in the house. She's tried before. Luckily he hid the drugs elsewhere so she spent hours ransacking the house looking for his stash but last night she managed to steal his boy. She was unconscious most of the day and was out so hard you could shake her and get no response. Since she woke up she has been completely psychotic and denying stealing his shit and rambling like someone in a institution for the criminally insane while pacing up and down the hallway. 

She has been walking all around the house talking to herself loudly and angrily. She tried to convince everyone the county sent her a letter saying they were giving her $5,000,000 for harassing her by putting her in jail. At one point she was saying she had the check in her pocket. Then she said she had a letter in her pocket saying they were giving her the money and all she needed to get it was an ID. Come to find out what she had is a post card informing her of a class action lawsuit lol. She said ""it says plaintiff and defendant so it's a criminal case. I'm going to ask for more money."" We had to explain what a class action lawsuit is to her even though she claims to have passed the bar. 

Oh yea she's lately been claiming to have passed the bar ""with a 100"" just for fun. Also said she passed the MCAT with a ""perfect score of 100"" rofl. Still waiting to tell her a perfect score is 528 I think but she's just say that's what she got. Its infuriating. I am tired of her lies so I asked her what habeas corpus is and she said without missing a beat that it meant to have something expunged lol. I then asked her about plessy v ferguson and she said ""I don't know what every single case ever was about"". Hahaha. I tried telling her this is very very basic stuff everyone even remotely interested in law would know about but she wouldn't back down with her bullshit. 

She also claims her stepdad is secretly the head of the department of defense and is ""in charge of the whole military"" and the hq for the department of defense is located under the very worst ghetto in our city. Her stepdad is really a teacher but that's just his cover. Lol. When she went to jail and was released she claims it wasn't bc she went to court and took a plea it was bc he sent high up members of the Air Force and navy to demand her release. 

She's been trying to set me up with her daughter for a long time now but her daughter is gross, mean and has incurable stds. Since I'm not interested in that daughter she started telling me about her other daughter. She says she's really hot and nice etc and we'd make a great couple. Then I find out the daughter in question is 16 and I'm 32. Wtf. What kind of mother tries to hook her 16 year old up with a 32 year old?

She claims she has ""a perfect IQ"" (she said today AT&T studied her brain for 3 months bc of her perfect IQ lmao)and went to ""a prodigy school for special brain people and retarded kids"". She also says she used to be a computer programmer so I asked her to name an operating system. She couldn't.  She said she took c+, c++ and c+++ rofl. We've been arguing over c+++ for days. Over the week since I've asked her to name an operating system she's given me many crazy excuses why she didn't know what the are. 

She's been mad at me today bc I told her I don't believe her wild claims. I told her if I said I spoke French but couldn't say a single thing in French I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't believe I spoke French. She still sticks to the bs though. 

She claims to be a Dr, a lawyer, a pharmacist, a computer programmer, a former stripper (this I believe) and a painter. I'm sure there are some I forget. I told her I used to be an astronaut and got a 100 on my astronaut exam lol. I might just start one upping any claim she makes. If she has a perfect IQ then I have have a perfect IQ +5 bc I got the bonus questions then they hooked my brain up to a special computer to analyze my massive smarts but I was so smart it broke the computer type shit lol. 

Well that's some of the wildness my insane compulsive lying roommate said lately. She wants pity for her lifelong cancer, envy for all of the millions of dollars she claims she has and awe of her extreme intelligence. She doesn't understand that these days she can't just bs her way through claiming she's a lawyer and shit though. Google is her undoing. ",1517591602.0

Didn‚Äôt touch anything for almost six years until I got hold of some codeine for a headache. I felt that exact same rush but nowhere near as intense. Within a short period of time I became addicted to over the counter codeine meds. I tried to kick it two years ago but the temptation was too great, especially since it was readily available at any pharmacy. I ended up moving halfway across the world to a country that has now banned over the counter codeine meds. I knew that this was an opportunity to finally get clean. I was using well over 600 mg of codeine a day. It‚Äôs been 24 hours and I‚Äôm feeling ok. I‚Äôve popped 300 mg of Lyrica, some diazepam and temazepam.

Then I'm asking if I'm a jealous bitch or if I'm right and want to know what you guys think about the whole thing. (And I do not intend to make this into a competition of who's the most fucked up junkie! I'm more about respecting the achievement of being a functional addict. Some things are just harder to overcome than others.) 




DISCLAIMER: I KNOW THAT EVEN GUMMI BEARS CAN BE THE FOCUS OF AN ADDICTION. I'M AWARE THAT ADDICTION IS A MORE COMPLEX AND NUANCED ISSUE THAN JUST OPIATE ADDICTION! I DON'T MEAN TO BELITTLE ANYONE'S EXPERIENCE! I'M NOT DRIVING AT A JUNKIER THAN THOU THING! SO PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT INTO ONE.




It pisses me off so bad when my roommate tries to make the case for his 'cannabis dependency'. It's infuriating! He said he's experiencing withdrawal from weed. I've stopped smoking often enough to know that sleep troubles are common, but they're done after 2 - 3 days. But dude, that's nothing compared to opiate withdrawal. I'd really like to slap him when he starts whining how hard it is to quit smoking. 




Like, a slap with the back of my hand, striking straight through the face, like *'wake up you idiot, you're okay! Be grateful for everything you have and go do your shit! You're part of a perfect couple, soon you'll be a doctor! Just don't fuck it up bc of your unhealthy fascination with drugs!'*





 I hate it when people have everything handed to them and still they're trying to make problems where there aren't any. I've met a couple of this sort and it makes me sick every time. They have options, they have resources, they have thousands paths laid out for them, they have suppor - WHY would anyone pretend to be underprivileged? Where's the kick in romanticizing mental health issues and addiction? Why not use in a more positive mindset?




What's really getting me angry is that he's my friend. He knows me and he knows how I struggle. He studies medicine, so he knows how fucked up it is to organize your life around a raging addiction to heroin and Cocaine! I mean, I'm dragging my ass out of bed and to work/uni every day with real wd symptoms when waking up. I don't have a rich, functional family or a romantic relationship that looks like it's out of a romantic novel. And yes, I am jelly and rambling, but... It just really pushes my buttons just to think of it. it feels like his overstating of his struggle with weed belittles what I achieve daily. I don't know. I never said those things to him, but am I wrong? This isn't healthy, right? Or am I just a condescending bitch on a junkier-than-thou trip, without noticing it? It's just, I feel like screaming 'be happy! If I had what you have, I'd be so happy!' tho I wouldn't be. I'd be depressed, then feel guilty for not being happy which turns into planning my suicide since I know I can't enjoy life the way I want to. But he's not depressed! I don't get where this fascination with hardship and misery comes from. Another friend of mine, with a verrrry wealthy background, was even worse. He always provoked having bad trips, psychoses and stuff. And when he had his first drug induced psychosis, he wouldn't stop talking about it. It became the central part of his identity for more than a year. Even when talking to complete strangers at a party whom we've just met - topic no1 is the psychosis. Like, dude, why would you want to identify yourself with disease!? I hate talking about my addiction or depression or migraines. I feel so helpless and angry when realizing how I can't do anything against my body being at war with me. I just want to be normal and functional! You have it all and you just shit on it? It's infuriating!

When I can pay 15 a point, break it down in several small lines, and get ganked out my mind for really just 15 bucks a night if I space it out?? Pills just seem so wasteful compared to dope.

You elites can keep your 10 mg hydros or oxy/roxys. I'll just keep bumping the ECP up my nostrils. Only pills I buy now are Xanax and that's because they're dirt cheap even on the street and to me a little Benzo can compliment a good dope buzz. To each their own I guess. 

Edit: I was wrong to call pill poppers ""elites"". I wasn't thinking clearly earlier and I apologize for offending anyone if they were. I just wish h users were treated equally to pill users.

     Well I was offered harder drugs a few times ya know the usual  coke, bars, roxis, heroin, and meth. but normally if its a drug I can shoot, I enjoy shooting it the best so I always said id just wait til next week. In order to not get high.

     Someone took out a pipe with a fat meth bowl packed started passing it around. So need less to say, drunk and stoned me couldn't resist.  

     So now my eyes are bloodshot from the weed, dialated from the meth, and swollen from the liquor and cigs. Probs also a lack of sleep. Anyways fam this is goodbye for now, I am going to try to get sober again before things get really bad and I start messing around with needles again. I CAN, not get high! 


TL;DR: Smoked meth after 60 days away from hard shit. At least I didn't inject anything tho. And I'm also glad of myself for not doing any dope. Usually that never happens. Day one sobriety tomorrow.",1517579108.0

Didn't want to disclose being an addict, but had to. They tried to get a blood sample and it crushed the nurses ego when they couldn't draw a drop from my shitty veins. 





God, I didn't want to tell the doc I was a user, but I gotta tell him I'm downing 1000mg of morphine daily as maintenance. I mean, they will put me under propofol. I admit, I'm looking forward to trying this, but I'm more torn between 'this is unnecessary' and 'if I have symptoms I should get it checked'.




I told the doc and wish I didn't. He was very weird about it, avoided eye contact and his attitude was all like 'why would you care for your health if you're shooting heroin into your veins?' good point, but still - not his job to point out. He didn't say anything and I bet this is 110% my own paranoia and my own uncomfy-Ness with being a junkie.





The real fun started when they wanted a blood sample. The nurse was crushed when she didn't hit at the 5th try. When the other doctor came in I luckily remembered I did a blood screening at my maintenance docs and offered to have the results sent over. Close call. I mean, if he would've looked any closer at my right arm, it would be clear as day *why* my veins are that bad.




This stressed me out majorly. Did any of you experience similar stuff? I hate going to other doctors than my maintenance doc (tho I don't like him either) and disclosing my addiction. Just this look people give you. Like  'oh so you're just pretending to be normal!'.

I've read a ton on this but can't find the answers to a few basic questions I have.


* 1) How much water should I dissolve one M/4 4mg hydromorphone with? It seems like the less the better, since I don't want to have to use a whole spray bottle just for one pill. What is the minimum amount I can use, and what is the best method to dissolve it?
* 2) I've read pills don't dissolve as well in water containing salt. I plan on using a saline solution since I'll be spraying this in my nose. Is this an issue?
* 3) Most people say to use an Afrin bottle for this. If I can't find one with a removable cap, is the best way to refill it with my solution to cut a hole, or is there some trick?


Thanks a ton for any advice dudes.


EDIT: **This is for anyone who googles this question and finds this thread hoping for information.** I made a nasal spray and have a few answers/suggestions. I ended up purchasing two bottles; a dose-controlled anti-allergy spray bottle (meaning it puts out the same volume of liquid in each spray), and a simple multi-function store brand saline rinse bottle.


I discovered there was no way to remove the top on the dose-controlled bottle so I ended up using the saline rinse bottle. I removed the spray apparatus/top (a spray top connected to a tube extended into the bottle, held in place with friction inside the bottle cap) and emptied the saline solution into a container. I then finely crushed one hydromorphone 4mg pill, measured 5mL of saline solution, and dissolved the crushed pill into the solution. I then put this solution into the saline spray bottle and re-attached the spray apparatus/top. I shook the bottle around a bit in hopes of better dissolving the pill.


This particular spray apparatus had three ""modes"" (I'm sure many of you who snort shit are familiar with this equipment, but I'm being thorough since this is meant to be informative for future google searches): spray if the bottle is held upright, stream if held horizontally, and drop if held upside-down. I chose to use the third option, the drop, as I figured it would result in the least waste (less ending up in my throat/stomach = more absorbed in my nose = higher bioavailability).


To dose, I leaned backwards, tilted my head back about 90 degrees, and put 5-10 drops in each nostril. I then waited several minutes (I wasn't keeping track, but my estimation is that it was 5-10 minutes) and repeated until the fluid left in the bottle was gone.


Did it work? Well I got high, and I had very little waste as **none** of the solution dripped into my throat/stomach, but it didn't really feel that much stronger than just snorting a 4mg crushed dilaudid in four small lines over 10 minutes. Was it worth it? Not really. ",1517547979.0

I got mono when I was younger, and I‚Äôve had chronic pain since, nothing bad enough to be treated for, but I was always achy, my joints hurt, I felt like I was too young to be in this pain. 

I started using not long ago at all... I first tried it in September or October... weekly use turned into twice a week, then daily. The reason I even used at all? I was in IOP for weed because i would get my legal charges dropped... I didn‚Äôt realize how uncomfortable I was sober. I just didn‚Äôt want to be coherent. I couldn‚Äôt handle life like that. Call me weak, I suppose. Years of therapy and medication and yet very little put me at ease or less of a mess. I am only 18 now. I was a messed up kid and I fear I‚Äôll be a messed up adult. I wanted to take back control of my life. And of course, my fianc√© plans to stop. That reason alone I will never look back. I will support him endlessly, through the detox and I‚Äôll write to him with he goes to rehab... and we can live a normal life together. By no means sober, but enjoying a blunt or even a benzo occasionally... neither of us can control ourselves when it comes to heroin. It has its grip on us.

Sometime in January I stopped cold turkey. I do not what warrants as a bad addiction, I did not think I was addicted, I still don‚Äôt know. My fianc√© says I‚Äôm in really bad denial. Fair enough. Most likely. You never realize how you look from an outsiders perspective.. I was very clearly on drugs... my parents started to catch on, I quickly dismissed them pleading that I knew nothing, even when they had found a sealed stamped bag in my room... 

I never experienced withdrawals until when I tried to stopI could go around 48 hours without any ill effects.  But this time I went longer than two days. I was hurting. I‚Äôve never felt pain, such bad aches, my bones hurt, I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable... I was sitting up in my boyfriend‚Äôs bed just crying for hours... weed wasn‚Äôt helping, Advil didn‚Äôt help, NyQuil... I couldn‚Äôt cope. I did maybe a small bump or two when I was stopping... like scrapes off a bag or left over on the desk... I didn‚Äôt use for maybe a week. Maybe a little longer. I did it, I was still hurting slightly but I did it right ? I wasn‚Äôt going to go back. My fianc√© however can‚Äôt just stop like that.. he needs to go to treatment. But he can‚Äôt until he graduates and gets his degree, or else he will lose his credits. So he‚Äôs waiting until may. He would ask to borrow money for bundles. He was using in front of me, him at his desk, me in his bed trying to pretend I didn‚Äôt hear him snorting. 

All I thought about was heroin. 

So I went back. I am using a lot less and a lot less frequently than I was. I don‚Äôt plan on doing this much longer. I woke up in the middle of the night about five days ago. I ordered insulin needles. U-100 0.5cc  30G x 1/2. It was the best selling. Pack of ten. Five dollars. Free shipping.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend, he got very upset. Even threatened to break up with me if I did it. But I do doubt that. I brought it up again today because they came. He got very upset, said whatever fuck it.

And I was selfish. I just wanted to try. I mixed two bags and some water. I usually boof. But I thought it needed to be filtered so I put some cotton in. Pulled it in, tapped it, made sure there was no air bubbles.
Poked myself over and over. Trying to register. No luck. Mostly in my left hand and arm. I switched to a new rig, I thought maybe the needle was too dull now. I Am right handed, but I used my left hand to shoot in my right hand. I registered. I pushed down slowly. It looked like my hand was getting swollen at the injection site, so I stopped. Rubbed it to avoid an abscess. Got another spot, registered, and finished it. I boofed the remaining water. Keep rubbing my hand. Slightly numb, I wonder if I slipped out of the vein. I‚Äôm about to get into the hot shower and massage it again, that‚Äôs how I was told  to prevent abscesses.

Honestly I didn‚Äôt like it. I was scared. It felt wrong. It made me wish I never started using. I felt low.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do it again.
I feel guilty.
And I know it hurt my fianc√©.

This shit really brings out the absolute worst in me.

Thank you for reading this, I know it‚Äôs pointless but it‚Äôs relieving to write somethings out... especially things I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone in my real life..",1517515452.0

So this may a be a bit long, but if you're high and have a minute, give it a read.

Quick run down of how I got to where I'm at. Joined the US Army after Highschool. Found myself in some shitty situations, tried heroin (smoked it) for the first time and got my leg blown off 3 days before coming home (amputation below the knee). Got all rehabbed up, nice little medical retirement, plus disability and some other allowances for having a fake leg. All and all comes out to about $3700 a month. Got pretty bored at home not doing shit so I moved to the country my Mom came from, Ukraine. 

Now 3700 USD in Ukraine is a fucking fortune, and boy have I lived it up and I've been here since 2012....

Ok, now you're caught up. Every day I drink about 6 liters of beer, 1 liter of vodka, pop 2.5g of Alprazolama and smoke 1 gram of that sweet sweet brown Afghan H. Thats just to not get sick. If I wanna get fucked up, It's usually much more than that, plus some coke. Obviously I didn't start off this way, but this is where I'm at now, and I've been at this level for about 6 months, it will only get worse from here. 

I recently had a situation where I took too much H (I think it was cut with fent or something else) and experienced an overdose. But who knows, with all I drink and the benzos I take. Either way, its time for me to get clean. So I went to a doctor here in Ukraine and they literally just said ""Just stop doing all that stuff""....yeah okay dude. 

I have pretty good insurance, its called Tricare and they cover some inpatient treatment and medical detox. Detoxing here in Ukraine isn't an option. The hospitals here look like the fucking movie Hostel. My current plan is to get to the American Hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, check myself and have them do their thing.
 (this is the same place I was MEDEVACed in 2010). I'm just wondering what you guys think. Am I too deep in this bullshit and should I just keep living this life until I die in the next couple years (or months), or should I get my my car, drive to Landstuhl and try to survive an alcohol, benzo and opiate withdrawal? Would love to hear your opinions guys and gals. 

Also AMA, I know I've lived quite an ""Alternative"" lifestyle as my very disipointed mother tells me lol. 

Love you guys

UPDATE: Ok guys, I've decided I'm gonna try to get some methadone (or the Ukrainian equivalent) to travel with, as crossing international borders with 10g of H just seems like a bad idea. I'll have enough benzos to get me to Germany and can pick up alcohol along the way if I need it. Going to see the Doc. Tomorrow and see what he says about the methadone script then head west. My car is big enough to sleep in and I've got plenty of money saved up for hotels. I'll keep you guys updated.",1517686122.0

Any ideas?,"TLDR: i just shot a speedball with a little less coke than usual and unexpectedly started nodding out whilst writing this post on how much I love speedballs. Now it's a lost about unexpected nods, too. Still nodding hard, going with the pirate eye lol. Asking for ideas and experiences from you guys regarding the nod. I'm a bit afraid that fent might become a thing around here. How long would the fent high last tho? 






Today I had to take the TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language, for my masters application) which means that when uni starts on Monday, I didn't really have any free time between work and uni except the rest of today and tomorrow since... Christmas. Tho Christmas doesn't really count. Had to study for the oral exam I took in Jan. But at least I had some time off work then. (My last 'vacation' was my ibogaine treatment in Spain last spring. It worked as advertised but I didn't and relapsed anyways lol.) 





So naturally I feel like I have to use this free time wisely and treat myself. I kinda rushed through the TOEFL and finished first. Then the notorious auto pilot in my head turned on and I scored some dope (got a good deal on it too! He threw in one extra bubble bc I waited in the cold until I couldn't feel my hands anymore only to find that he doesn't have coke). So I had to get the girl elsewhere. Thought for a sec about ordering the coke taxi but then I'd have to buy at least a gram. And that's a dangerous amount to have for me. I gotta be up and running by Monday! And so I waited some more in the cold. The coke man came by car which he usually doesn't. I waited where we usually meet, headphones in, eyes locked to the screen, when a (very small) stone hit me. And I was like - is someone throwing rocks (pun not intended) at me? Well it was him lol. 




Anyways, what is super weird is the following. I prepped a shot and put in a little less coke than usual, but just as much dope as before, not more, maybe even a little less. I wanted to continue to tidy my room, but when I took my phone to turn on some music and share my joy on reddit I noticed I was nodding off bc I had only one eye open... Instead of doing sth about it (that was at least an hour ago) I'm still sitting here enjoying the nod and browsing the internet. Haven't even removed the tourniquet yet lol.
 I was so focused on speedballs during the last months that I kinda forgot how nice it is to catch a simple nod off of dope and not only to get me to sleep.  




But what worries me is *why* this happened. Has the time already come that our dope is being cut w fent? My tolerance is super high, usually it takes a lot to get me nodding like this. Especially since I had been using about 1.8g dope on top of my 1000mg maintenance morphin during my binge, just to provide some context. Especially when there's coke in the shot. Like, ftw How did this happen? Any ideas? Experiences? 




 And dude, I'm still nodding out. Typing this took forever and I apologize for any lack of coherence, grammar or spelling. I'd really like to have another shot but this nodding is crazy... Just was out again!





PS: I'll follow up with dopepr0n when I do the next shot.

Dose to only 8 mg per day.

After starting Suboxone I noticed that I was getting A LOT MORE emotional and I would start crying while I was by myself thinking of past events (things I've never done before).. 

So like I said to make a long story short I've been trying not to use Suboxone because I do not want to be on it anymore but I have two pieces of my spine that are fused together which causes me tremendous amount of pain.  For a while Suboxone did help but lately it has not been doing the job and it's been excruciating. 

Not sure what to do considering there is no pain management (as far as I know) while on Suboxone. 

Yesterday I didn't use the box in which didn't seem to be a problem because I started using Xanax to help with the with withdrawl symptoms, but today is a completely different day and I can feel the sweaty palms, heart palpitations, Extreme anxiety , etc..it's the cold sweats that's really killing me right now (not to mention it's fucking freezing where I am)

TL;DR Can someone tell me how they did it themselves after tapering off from a very low dose of Suboxone to know Suboxone at all with minimal with drawl symptoms? ",1517672548.0

When i came back to earth, i felt so guilty for laying in bed for 2 days (by that point i was well enough to get back to work). Yet on heroin i was fully content to lie in bed for weeks, months...

I honestly believe ill never do heroin again. which is huge for me, as ive tried to quit (and gotten through w/d) only to start again what feels like 100 times.

I'm a daily tar user and got called for a interview next week. My plan is to switch to subs this weekend or possibly kratom. I'm not worried about the drug test itself (if offered) since I'm not going to try to cheat it.

I am wondering for anyone who recently had a job interview, did they drug test you the same day (if required), or did they drug test you only after they've offered you the job? And if so, how long after the interview did they drug test you, what method, etc?

Reason I ask is so I know I have enough time to be clear of H without having to worry about drinking 2 gallons of water a day/etc. Also, in case if i fail to induct to subs/kratom properly this weekend and was still using the day of the interview, would I have to be worried about a same day drug test or not.

https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/nedgad/canada-is-prescribing-heroin-to-treat-opioid-addiction

I stumbled upon this article the other day. I can just sum it up as talking about how Canada opiate maintenance programs have been overwhelmingly positive. I have been told all these horrible things and stories about heroin but in this article they depict people with full blown legal opiate addictions functioning fairly normally. What the flying fuck? this gentleman is talking about going to school?

>Having a steady and clean supply means Cooper has stopped committing crimes, and recently rented his first apartment. The prescription injection doesn‚Äôt make him feel high and out of control like before. ‚ÄúYou get your warm glow, but it‚Äôs different from when you‚Äôre desperate with nothing, ducking in a doorway,‚Äù he said recently after taking one of his doses. He‚Äôs thinking about going back to school and upgrading his first aid certification.

I am not one of those people who thinks that all drug users should go to jail. But this is a very strange idea to me. I did more digging and found this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment

>Thus, patients in heroin-assisted treatment are relieved from the major complex of problems that defines illicit heroin use. Synthetic heroin taken under the aforementioned conditions is not neurotoxic and has few long-term side effects beside constipation and dependency.

This sort of flies in the face of this video which I found online

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9huWlXFA1s

This video portrays heroin as a scary horrid thing

I hope I am making sense here. But I live in a large city, come from a good family and earn good money. I have a college education and have experimented with drugs like coke, xanax, adderal, mdma, shrooms, and weed. I never found any of them that interesting outside of shrooms and just lost interest after I quit weed and stopped associating with that friend group. I step outside and see drug addicts shooting up in plain sight. I presume that they are homeless, thats why they do this in the streets. And I presume that they just don't give a fuck about life anymore. Why is it that 80% of heroin addicts in netherlands hold full time jobs? while heroin addicts in the states suffer so much?

I know it may seem like a silly question, but how bad is heroin? This all sort of confusing. I don't mean this in an offensive way, I am genuinely curious

I am a software engineer. I wakeup at 6am, workout/do yoga, drink coffee and work. I read about medicine, nutrition, spirituality, and personal finance when I come home. Based on what I know, most people could not do this if they were on heroin? so why is it we see such different outcomes with the same drug in different countries? Is it just the issue of money? and if so, could I hypothetically do everything that I do in the course of a day on heroin? From what I know its fairly debilitating. how can one go to school like this?

I'd like to mention that I recently moved to a bigger metropolitan than the previous city I was in.

The guy I normally go through is out of town, which isn't an issue. I've dealt with addiction for 8 years so I was ready to go through the withdrawals, it's nothing new and I enjoy taking a break to reflect.

Side note - r/kratom is the perfect substitute when it comes to dealing with withdrawals.

I'd like to state I no longer fear for withdrawals anymore, KRATOM for me personally gets rid of ALL the withdrawal symptoms and I was able to go 6 days with no type of opiates, and I couldn't have felt better.

Decided to say fuck if, I got myself back into a decent career and decided to try and cold cop.
Whisper App was no luck and I was unsure of how else to obtain, until I realized how easy it is no matter what city you're in.

Straight went downtown to the ""Needle Exchange Center"". If you're unfamiliar; needle exchange is pretty straight forward, you exchange your old used up dull needles for new ones.

Met a gentleman who was the same age as me except he had nothing to his name and lived off the streets.

I just paid rent and felt genuinely bad for the guy, I hate to help feed others addiction but fuck, the guy was going to boost shit and sell it for dope later on that day anyway he stated.

He was a nice guy, I told him I don't fuck around and ""junkies"" (I hate that word) should help each other out instead of stealing from each other.

Told him if he can get me a ball, I'll buy him 0.5 for himself. 

This guy almost cried lmao. 

It reminded me how evil this shit is; everything was going completely wrong for this guy, but the fact I bought him his own 0.5, he was overwhelmed with emotion.

He told me since basically his entire adult life, after his mom died, he has been living off of the streets. Always looking over his shoulder, and trusting no one.

Long story short, he was overwhelmed with emotion since he feels society has disowned him and is no longer accepted. Meaning ""no one has helped me"" type of situation the guy was expressing towards me.

Jos√©, I know you won't see this - but keep your head up. 

You stated you have nothing to your name but a horrible addiction, and somehow are able to smile through the entire day with or without heroin.

And even though it's just the first day I feel so free already. They gave me 30mgs and I still have some cold sweats but NOTHING compared to what I was going through during my intake. Also everyone I met was so nice and supportive and seemed like they actually care about the people and not the money. The doctor seemed a little too dose happy but overall a nice guy. 
I'm so excited to get my life back on track and start picking up all the pieces that is my broken life. 
Even better my dad helped me pay and him and my mom are more than on board and extremely supportive of me. Which I know I am very very lucky for. After my dad left a lot of patients at the clinic told me how lucky I am that my family is that supportive and willing to pay for it until I get back on my feet and can afford it. 

Just feeling really really good right now and wanted to share. If you're on methadone and have any tips I would love to hear them! I plan on staying on the lowest dose possible im not going to get a legal high / buzz I 100% whole heartedly want to just feel normal and be on a stable dose and worry about tapering down when I cross that bridge. My counselor told me usually around a year or two is when people start tapering if they're ready which sounds like a good plan to me. 

How's everyone doing today? Hopefully not sick and having happy nods. If you're thinking about getting on MMT and the stigma is stopping you, I say just do it. The myths about it aren't 100% true. You don't have to be on it for life unless you want to. I'm just kicking myself that I didn't do this earlier I could of saved so much time and not ruined my life so badly.

Story time ladies and gentlemen.,"*edit* i meant ‚ÄúPut yourself through‚Äù. Cant edit the thread title i guess. 

Obviously many times I returned change, returned soda cans for deposit, and pawned shit.  But i have two bigguns.  One time i was so desperate, I called the dopeman and asked him if he would give me a half g (lowest amt he sold) if i let him buy groceries with my foodstamp card.  He said if you give me double, ill do it.  40=cost 80= amount of food he wanted.   So i had to go grocery shopping in the hood, with a G ass black dude that I only saw for a few seconds each day.  (White suburban dude over here).   Surprisingly we had a decent conversation in the store.  

But my worst experience was when i used to buy red bull on my foodstamp card and sell them to a liquor store in the hood for half price amd get the cash.  I did that each month until I had no more money on the card.  Then i graduated to liberating red bull from stores and selling them.  I took 8 12 packs from a store.  Loaded em up in a cart and walked the fuck out. Dumb as hell, but desperate.   Now on occasion, there would be a cop just bullshitting behind the bulletproof glass with the liquor store owner, so when I pulled up that day and saw a cop car, i didnt think twice. I had nothing on me, so i had no worries.  I was just going to wait until he dipped and then go in w the cases.   A few minutes go by and I see a plainclothes cop w a vest on walking up to my car, and he looks in my backseat and sees all these cases of red bull.  He was going to tell me that the store was closed, until he saw the redbull. Turns out all the unmarked cars in the lot were cop cars as well, and the store was getting raided by The Vice department for buying stolen goods for resale.  Now in my city, big midwestern place where they make cars, these cops dont fuck around.  They knew exactly what i was doing, and why I was doing it.  Immediately the cop pulls me out of the car, pats me down and starts asking me where the drugs were.  I told them that I didnt have any drugs, and they didnt find any drugs either.  Or rigs cuz i snorted only.  I told them i bought the shit with my foodstamps and they asked for a receipt, and I told them you really think i would keep my recoept for evidence of me pulling this fraud?  They bought it i guess and after a few minutes of them trying to get me to snitch, they let me go.  They could tell i was dopesick, and i straight up told them I was an addict, and i didnt have anything on me.  But i wasnt about to snitch.  The consequences of what I did that day did not outweigh getting shot or my house shot up.  These dopemen i fucked w were hood as fuck and would definitely fuck you up or kill you for snitching.  I cant believe i put myself in some of the places and situations i did and never got robbed or roughed up but thats another story.  

So I guess since i was honest with them and i didnt have any dope on me, and they couldnt prove that I stole the redbull, they let me go.

Like almost a year. Since then ive taken kratom and sometimes little bits of methadone, but off of the spending hundreds of dollars a week on heroin fentanyl mix off the street though, and since dnms got all fucky i havent bothered loggin back in. 

So my life is slowly, slightly getting better, i tell myself, it really isnt by normal standards as im stuck spinning my wheels it feels like, for reasons, but about once a month like clockwork, down to the fuckin day, i get really different feeling, i feel like i used to feel all the time, somewhat more creative, calm, in touch, but i also really really really really really really really very much badly so want to get a bag of smack and get high. Its never good anymore, the dope is cutup fentanyl death garbage heroin and i get so sick to my stomach off it and spend all night in the bathroom throwing up skittles and various sour candies. 

But i still want it. I discarded all my numbers, so i have to cold cop , but its all the same shitty dope anywyas. 

But  my dgirl was like the only person i liked and now that i cut her out of my life i miss her badly, i really liked her, i didnt just want to fuck her either, i seriously would have been fine just hanging out wih her for a few here and there. Im really worried about her, i am thinking of sending her a present, what should i buy for a stylish girl teenage drug dealer? I hate to admit this, but if i find out she died i will be super jealous of her. I know how fucked up that sounds but just thinking of losing another friend to the eternal mist makes me feel so lonely, its almost depressing getting high off dope i didnt buy from her, i domt know how to explain it better than that. Its just this fucked up feeling. I smoke so much pot to distract myself but lately it just gives me mad introspection and i hate that shit all the time. 


I remember being strung out, i remmeber withdrawals, i dont want that, i just want to snort a tiny bag and feel that touch of bliss again, its brutal sometimes. Oh well. Hopefully some u lil niggas can relate. Anyone just want to die sometimes but not really at the same time? I feel like i know what i want but also i dont and even if i did i wouldnt be able to get it 

Does anyone want to start a gang with me? We will wear leather jackets and talk like the fonz

He looked like a regular dude but in work clothes more or less. 

What I *did* notice is his arms were goose bumped and he looked cold as fuck but it wasn't particularly cold outside. He seemed like he had a bad cold so I figured he was in WD and needed a fix.

There's no H where I live - just pills btw. Anyway, he asks me if i can spare a couple bucks and I give him a $20. Something I've wished would happen to me for years when I was asking people for cash a long time ago.

I don't think he expected me to give it to him. I think he thought I was going to pass the $20 for the dollars I had alongside it and give him just a couple of those lol.

His eyes got huge and you could see the fucking relief wash over his face - I was his answered prayer and it felt **amazing** to be the good guy for once.

I told him it was none of my business but, I said, ""now that you got cash, do you have a solid place to score at?"" He looked at me like he hadn't decided if he was going to lie or just say fuck it and cop to the truth - he went with the truth and laughed and said ""Yeah, man I do.""

He thanked me over and over and we parted ways. I'm sure I'll see him again. I'm pretty sure I've seen him around.

If I had to guess I would really say closer to like 10 or 11 months ... I've made a lot of mistakes in those years ... I've gotten clean time and thrown it away(at least a dozen times) I've redestroyed my life countless times and I've done unspeakable things to my girlfriend (we've been together for 4 years now, she does t use, for some reason she has stuck with me even still)and I've run out on my loved ones countless times... all these things of course in the name of ""just one more"" most recently thou I've had about 16 months under my belt (on subs) I got clean about a month before my daughter was born (i know father of the year right,but hey ... so far my daughter has never seen me high) well anyways I've dealt with a lot of pain and a lot of uncontrollable use ... well about a week ago today I decided to pick up a speedball (over my career of use this is something I've always been able to do just once ... I have plenty of times done just one more ... well ... not this time ... I have spiralled out of control ... blowing money like it's no ones business ...

Like normally it takes a full fledged relapse before I will go completely down the tubes and even then I've never experienced anything like this... I can not stop ... no matter what I tell myself or do like I'm litteraly dwindling myself down to nothing over and over again ... and it's very quickly reached a boiling point... I love my life now and I love my family and I am not willing to lose the stuff I've worked so hard for over the past two years ... I've come really far and am a completely different person than I used to be (except for the obvious problem at hand ) ... I'm going to have to tell Somone like my mom and my girlfriend (I'm almost certain my girlfriend will leave me, but I'm more worried about not being able to see my daughter ) ... I'm honestly really scared ... I've never felt that from my addiction (and it has deffinantly brought me to my knees countless times, I spent years strungout living outside on the streets and in traps) ... I've been doing really reckless shots ( I only shoot speedball also, although I'm currently using crack instead of coke because I don't live in a huge city and dimes and dubs of powder are not really super common but I CAN get really good hard) either way I am certain if it wasn't for my built up tolerance from suboxen I would be dead ... and even still I've deffinantly come close a couple times in the past two day ... today I did a 3 and 1 and I was so sure I was gonna fall out I started texting a goodbye letter to my girl daughter and mom ... however I didn't and I immediately went and copped again right after... this shit is bananas ... any words of encouragement and or advice would be greatly appreciated ...

Even though not a proper miracle, it helped and it's a godsend.","I've combed through hundreds of research papers looking for something that was different from commonly prescribed SSRIs/NDRIs and other common medications.

I picked up in one research paper that depression can cause your endogenous opioid levels to drop (strange thing is that the data in that paper was trash, but the premise was sound) and also found Tianeptine in other overview research paper that was comparing various atypical antidepressants (that do not act directly on serotonine or dopamine).

At first, I was a bit concerned about taking another opoid that is mju receptor agonist for prolonged time (because it basically means addiction).

But when I tried it...it worked almost instantly. It's not all happiness and peaches, but at least I can fairly confidently say I am no longer depressed (or at least not as much depressed as before).

The question I am pondering is whether I should have a stop after let's say two weeks for a day or two, just to test the addiction potential. Tianeptine is short-acting (few hours), so getting clean of its effects, including withdrawal, shouldn't take longer than two days.

Anyone here took Tianeptine for longer periods of time (months, years)? Could you also comment on tolerance build up?",1517709873.0

I don‚Äôt have many close homies, and the ones I do are probably sick and tired of me but hung about it. But basically back in Spring of ‚Äò17 I was hustling with my baby mama. Life was damn good! We both were working and used that money to pay the bills. And meth was selling in our town for fucking $120 a gram all day. So we spoiled our daughter, and for a good while there all we did was smoke weed. My daughter was never around drugs by my hand. But... shit started to change. We started making less and less money, because baby mama was dipping into the supply. I honestly didn‚Äôt notice for a LONG time. But eventually it became obvious.

I started having to lock the dope up at a locker at my place of work. I‚Äôd give her an allowance but she‚Äôd need more and more and MORE! Until we started getting into vicious fights about it. Eventually she got me locked up, stole all our money and split out of the state with my daughter. She‚Äôs out where drugs are much more scarce, and she‚Äôs NEVER been a bad mother so I‚Äôm not worried... definitely miss my baby girl because she was my best friend hands down. Used to have tea parties and dance parties every day with that little rascal... but I get to FaceTime her and visit when I can. So it‚Äôs okay now.

I ended up moving back home and meeting this TIGHT 18 yr old friend of my sisters. This chick was a cutie and was only 4 foot and 9 inches. That‚Äôs a legal fucking MIDGET homie. I swear to god that pussy was the best I will EVER encounter. We fucked 3 times the first night we hung out inside a hotel room I purchased. She had no idea that I was back to my shit... doing a little bit of heroin and pills whenever I could get away. Eventually she caught me, and she actually wanted to do it! At first I thought it was amazing and I started getting back into the pill game selling and smoking em up. She fell in love with me, but would say shit like ‚Äúthese [pills] just make me love you so much more‚Äù hahahaha so right there I knew how this was gonna end up. 

I got a job opportunity out of town that was too good to pass up on. She moved with me, but not before pushing me (didn‚Äôt have to push to hard) to rob my pill dealing (close family member). We dipped to this hotel two and a half hours away from home were I was gonna start working. And that‚Äôs when shit when down hill. My pill dealing fam called me out and shit. She ended up fighting with me about it, and SHE flushed all of my fucking pills. I‚Äôm talking 15 of the 30 M‚Äôs, probably about two dozen Morphines, and a shit ton of Xanax. Idek how much haha. 

After she flushed the pills the next day she was withdrawing hard. She had never done hard drugs before, and she blamed everything on me. Which ya know... some of it was my b. I was more than eager to get her hooked like me. But anyway, she ended up robbing me while I lay in bed dying, taking my clothes, and taking the car that we took out there. She dipped back home without me, and while the car was technically hers and all... I just paid outrageous amounts to fix it up and get it inspected and registered. So that was fucked. Me and her have hooked up a few times since the break up, just because I probably won‚Äôt ever be able to turn down that midget pussy. Just take my word for it, it‚Äôs the wettest tightest shit in the fucking world lmfaooo. 

A few months after our break up the legal midget girl moved out of state to stay with her cousins. I text her occasionally and I‚Äôd do anything to get back with that girl. And not just for the world class chocha. She was a good one for sure. But anyway I was back on the prowl. 

At this point I was single and I was back ON man. Started feeling proud about myself again. Got a GOOD job working my ass off in a ducking coal mine. I showed up lit as shit everyday and had an amazing Junky Credit Score. Dealers in my home town were like in love with me lmfao. And while I was out partying with my mostly drug free friends, I met another girl who I still consider to be light years out of my league. 

She had that vibe where you could tell she used to be goth in high school, but now she just wore black and got tattoos. Her hair was dark and her skin was like an olive color. She ended up slipping to me that she ‚Äòliked heroin‚Äô while it was just me and her sharing a smoke outside. My eyes probably lit up like Christmas. I told her if she wanted to get high she just had to give me a ride. I ended up not being able to score that night. But for the next week all we did was kick it when I was off work and smoke tar. 

I eventually got ousted from my home because of drug use, and lost my ride to work. I lost the job, but used my last check to go on one hell of a binge with that girl. It took a surprisingly long time before we actually hooked up. But when we did I was glad. She had that junky style skinny that we all know fairly well. And I honestly think that is the hottest type of body there is...

We just got hotel rooms, racked up drug debts, and fucked. We had a lot of fun, except for the times my dick was to drugged out to work lmdaooo. I got her to eat my ass one time lmfao! I‚Äôm not into fingers up there, but a tongue feels heavenly. Eventually my money ran out though, so we were living at my grandmas and eating off her allowance from her mother (chick was 19 but still dependent on her rich ass momma). That just stresses any situation out a lot, and I knew it was bound to end. I caught mad feelings for that girl, but I‚Äôm just to high anymore to give a fuck. Even she fucking moved though! Like 3 hours away hahah! They all **really leave** when they ‚Äòleave‚Äô me hahaha. Me and her still text too, and I‚Äôm gonna be visiting her in her town soon. Cause she might not have been as wet or tight as the midget girl, this girl is stunning and so much better at having sex. Skills pay the bills baby. ",1517821061.0

So, if any melbournians/australians are aware, Codeine is prescription only, which is a horrible decision, not because i want a cheap high that will kill my liver, but because people have legitimate pain and the government really thinks that it would solve the opiate crisis...

If you're not aware of my situation, im 23 and i have chronic back pain, or, sciatica, with spinal stenosis and scoliosis, all of which aggravates my back a crapload.

I'm stuck on what american's call tylenol 3, (500mg paracetamol, 30mg codeine), it doesn't even tough the pain but it does enough for me to not cry out in pain every time i move. I'm fucking sick of relying on pills to feel somewhat better, but it's the only option i have... i tried requesting for shit like low dose oxycodone, just so i can get an alternative treatment or atleast a different pill that can help, no-go, the doctors here are tighter then a nuns cunt. I got prescribed 200 panadeine fortes (sorry, tylenol 3's), and im already almost out (got them on the 20th of last month)... i know its an unhealthy amount im taking, but its either take the recommended dosages and still be in pain or step it up and risk liver fucking damage, which is my biggest fear. 

I know people recommend the CWE (?) method, but if i remember correctly, codeine and paracetamol work well together, and codeine alone isn't much of a pain killer, its more of a recreational thing... but im stuck between a fucking rock and a hard place and already this year ive thought about doing myself in. Pain is horrible every day, i wake up and i can't move unless i literally roll to the other side of the bed, take my pills, wait in agony for an hour until they kick in and then i can slowly get up and walk around, im fucking 23 and i feel like a WW2 vet with 70 year old injuries. Every day i wake up crying, both in sadness and in pain as i realise that this is my life now. 

I hate opiates, and i love them too, i hate the negative stigma around them but i also understand them, im so confused about life right now, and for the past 4 years i feel like ive been living on these pills more then on life itself. 

Even now im practically sobbing, you guys might see me as a username who can type but fucking oath ive been battling this horrific pain for almost 5 years and im sick of it.

Not to mention my painkillers (200 T3's) run out in 2-3 days and withdrawals + incredible back pain is going to send me over the edge, and im scared.

I have a little more than a 8mg strip so probably about 12 mg total.

1) what's the best way to go about a taper? I want to do it in the shortest time possible to make it as easy and painless as I can. 

2) after tapering, if I do it right, will I really have any physical symptoms ? In the past I've had minor aches and low energy but the worst was the cravings.

3) what would (in your opinions) be the worst thing I'll have to deal with? I know the depression and lethargy will be the main culprit but I'm mainly concerned about physical stuff. 

4) if I do the taper right, am I going to have to deal with RLS or can that be avoided? That's my biggest concern because I honestly cannot stand the restless legs. My girl hates it as well and she thinks I'm already through the process so I don't want to be kicking her at night and tossing and turning ... I'm not worried about not being able to sleep really.

5) if I do have some minor aches, what can I do to alleviate them? Just Tylenol and such? 

6) is there anything to help combat RLS if I'm stricken with it once I'm off the sub? I just really fucking hate it. 

7) after I'm through with the taper and all I need to function and do stuff. I have school and an internship and I need to be able to function well at these things. I can't take time off or anything so I want to make sure I'm alright. 

8) I don't WANT to do this but if I end up having a bad day for RLS or something would using a small amount of dope to alleviate it put me back to day one and make me have to withdrawal for a week and start the process over ? Like I said I do not want to do this but hypothetically if I used one day would it fuck everything up in the physical standpoint ?

9) how long til I start feeling ""normal""? Last time I tapered was at a rehab and I did a 10 day taper but I started at 16mg and went down to 2mg on the last day of it and i didn't really have any physical symptoms, it was more just a lack of energy and the mental stuff like depression and anxiety. 

Sorry about all the questions but I just wanna do this right and I don't have the option of going to rehab or taking a few weeks off to get myself back to normal.

TL;DR- I need to taper with sub and I want to do it in the shortest amount of time possible. If I do a taper over a week or so, will I be able to function as a person and do all of the stuff I have to do without feeling too uncomfortable? The mental stuff is fine I can deal with that. I just don't want to be physically sick because that makes it really hard. Also, will I face any RLS if I do it correctly and if so what can I do to manage that? 

I just want to taper off of the sub and get back to normal. I'm ready to be done. ",1517791689.0

I already know and firmly believe that his emergency is not my crisis. He forgot that his roxy appointment is Monday and he didn't set aside any money to pay for a cab. So I guess he was hoping he could get me to help him somehow even though I have no money aside from the money I spent yesterday on my awesome haircut (I go to an Italian ""stylist""). 


&nbsp;

So I just texted him some background about my condition, specifically that I had no money to spare aside from $8 left over from an Uber gift card. I know if I pay for his Uber, he'd pay me back with roxies but it would be a one-way ride.


His response to this information?

**Cliff: Jesus, wtf am I going to do 2mrrw?**


Followed by,

Cliff: Stil at work?        --     (I'm actually home but I want to ensure I'm left alone to enjoy my day off until I'm ready to speak to him in person)


Cliff: Let me know when you leave work. (Does it really matter?


&nbsp;



So I'm not sure how he expects me to help him tomorrow aside form physically biking to the pharmacy to pick up his roxy script, BUT **there is a bonus**.



This time, when I visit Cliff's house to talk about plans for tomorrow, it is **very likely** that I will finally inform Cliff that I will not be spending my pay day money on dope this week. 



#The next Cliffpost will showcase how Cliff responds to that news.

Update: Before I went on my merry way, he didn't ask me what I plan to do on pay day and he was so focused on what he was going to do tomorrow. So tomorrow, when I receive the handful of pills he owes me, he's gonna ask me what I plan to buy on pay day (dope) so that he can decide how many more pills to give me. It is at that point in time I'll have to inform him of what I'm not spending money on.


The next Cliff post will still contain the aforementioned reaction. ",1517789535.0

Have a few questions (I don't take opiates.)","Don't get me wrong, I've got high before. I loved benzos and class A's when I was in my 20s.

But I got married, had a kid and grew out of all that.  The friends I lost got into heroin, two of them are now dead.  One was 29, the other 41 years old. Gone too early.  They used to party with me, I grew out of it and ""got boring"", they got into H.  I never did speak to them when finding out because I didn't want to be around it.

I'm intrigued by opiates because I know that I would love them.  But I won't start them because I have an addictive personality and my son means the world to me.

Anyway, a few questions if I'm allowed?

1. Do you all live in decent accommodation and keep it clean/tidy or are the Trainspotting scenes realistic? I am a clean freak and the thought of getting high surrounded by dirt and mess doesn't appeal to me at all. 

2. Some of you have $30-$50 a day habits. How on earth do you afford this? I just don't understand what a 'hustle' is?

Oh well oh well so here we stand
But we stand for nothing
My heart calls to me in my sleep
How can I turn to it
'Cause I'm all locked up in this
Dark place -
And I do not know
I'm as good as dead
My head aches -
Warped and tied up
I need to kill this pain

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm six feet underground

How long I'm tied up
My mind in knots -
My stomach reels
In concern for what I might do or
What I've don
It's got me living in fear
Well I know these voices must
Be my soul
I've had enough I've had enough of being alone
I've got no place to go

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm six feet under ground

Six feet under
In my grave
Lying wired and shut and quiet in my grave
Leave me here
Leave me here to waste here
So young and here I am again
Talking to myself
As a T.V. blares
Oh man
Oh how I wish I didn't smoke
Or drink to reason with my head

But sometimes this thick confusion
Grows until I cannot bear it at all
Needle to the vein
Needle to the vein
Take this needle from my vein my friend
I said

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone

In my grave
Lying
Lying cold in my grave
The reason -
My reason
Take my head off this terror
The fearing won't come back
I can't see
My mind's all wiped clean
The needle
Make my great escape
I seem caught in time
My head leaves me behind
Body falls cold
And I see heaven",1517775003.0

Sex is obviously amazing, but after a while it loses its allure and you realize that sex usually comes with some sort of emotional baggage and is much better when done with someone you care about. Sex and orgasms are very nice, but like you can't compare it to heroin, heroin comes with problems obviously more so than sex. But the sheer euphoria of heroin/hard opiates is something that doesn't exist anywhere else. They are just too different to compare, like apples and oranges, 

Sex is, if you take the necessary precautions, a healthy and worthwhile thing, it is sustainable and good for one. While heroin is the opposite, heroin blasts you with its effects then leaves you in ruins.

The last couple days I‚Äôve been using it and it completely word it calmed me down made me a lot less anxious I was doing things around the house staying busy, working out, etc ... 

But today I wake up and I kind a have this shitty mood so I try taking a bar or two to try to mellow me out like usual, but instead I find myself in a really bad mood not wanting to do anything I have no energy, no will to stay productive...etc. 

To make this story semi-short, Bear with me here, ORIGINALLY I was prescribed (x2) 8mg does Suboxone‚Äòs which seem to be working fine, but I rarely ever used two in one day it was usually like 4 mg per day and this was going on for the last I don‚Äôt know at least a year? 

A side story I should probably have included was that I‚Äôve been tapering down off of Suboxone.. hence why I copped alprazolam to help with WD. 
Usually this method helped especially in the first couple days where anxiety from not using as much Suboxone was at its max.... 

Can someone tell me if this is just Suboxone being a stupid fucking cunt and making me go through WD, or is my tolerance on Xanax skyrocketing and I‚Äôm not taking enough to feel like how I have in the last two days...?

My boyfriend died of a heroin overdose on January 14th, I found him on the 17th because him not responding for 3 days was odd so I went over to his apartment, no spare key in the box and he had the deadbolt locked, had to have the police kick in the door. By the time we got in there, he was already decomposing because he had the heat turned up to 95 degrees, I'm wondering if using drugs (I found out later on that in the weeks leading up to this that he was also using crack and meth) would cause him to turn the heat up that much? I'm waiting on the tox report to see what exactly he had in his system but also I was wondering if heroin stacks? Like he would have used it as soon as he got it, and then when he got home probably 2 hours later and used again, if the first time he used meant it didn't have fentanyl in it, would his overdose be caused by injecting too close in time together as in when he got it, when he got home and then probably again at home? Apologies if I'm not making sense or worded it confusing, I just feel like my mind is going crazy looking for answers I may never get. His overdose was an accident, not intentional because of him telling me that morning see you Tuesday and then thru text message later that day that he found a new halfway house that he was going to move into at the end of January and he was excited to get clean again and get back on the right track.

So, i myself am scripted oxy10‚Äôs and Xanax 2mg bars.. both 2x a day... the oxy doesn‚Äôt touch my pain anymore as I‚Äôve been scripted for a few years now even though I‚Äôm only 26. With that said I‚Äôve been lucky enough to find a steady source of 40mg oxymorphone, aka G74 aka God tier opiate lol, so i buy his script every month for the last 2 years or so and it‚Äôs been lovely..

Occasionally i run out of the pandas early sometimes due to quick flips being that i get it at an amazing price and sell it for 3x-4x what i pay per. But when that happens and i run out before my guy goes again it‚Äôs just complete hell; Even with my script of 10‚Äôs and Xanax to ease the withdrawals it‚Äôs just very uncomfortable after being so used to the opana for my pain relief, not to mention the utter & complete bliss that we all know opana to be. 

Fast forward to Sunday and i finish off what i have of my opana stock with my guy not scheduled to go until early next week. Fuck me right, gonna be a longggg week and half..

I sit at home tonight after a long agonizing day at work, i just finish rolling my blunt, take a half a bar and prepare to take a hot shower to relieve some of the pain and aches of my everyday life of physically demanding work along with chronic pain bundled with oncoming withdrawals... when all of a sudden, my FaceTime rings... that‚Äôs odd i say to myself, as i see it‚Äôs my GF, odd bc she rarely FT‚Äôs me and knows I‚Äôm going through it rn. (She dabbles but no where near my level, thank god & god bless.) 

So, i answer the FaceTime and it‚Äôs my beautiful GF screaming how much I‚Äôm about to love her; before i could ask what‚Äôs going on she flashes a bag of 10 G74 pandas!!!!!! that i stashed at her house a few months ago that we both had forgotten about long ago, that she stumbled upon while cleaning a junk up draw that she hasn‚Äôt used in months.

I was so ecstatic i can‚Äôt even put it in words lol, jumped in my car, sped to her house and gave her the biggest hug and kiss followed the biggest celebration lines!!

Some may say this is just a shit post or not JJ but if you know what it‚Äôs like to go without opana after being on it steady for so long... than you know it was nothing short of a miracle from JJ himself to blesss us with that find to hold me over.. 

Not to mention I‚Äôm going to an NBA game tm night so without my meds it would have been very uncomfortable to say the least!  but now all is well!!

Sorry for the long post but had to share my find with my fav sub! Have a great night everyone and stay well, high, & safe!!!

So my boyfriend, my really close friend Zack, and I are driving on the freeway to go cop some tar. We see this Prius up ahead and they have no lights on it‚Äôs 11pm and they almost hit the center divider. We‚Äôre like oh shit dude this person is hella fucked up. We started recording this drunk driver because this was the craziest driving we‚Äôve ever seen. Driver was zigzagging across the entire freeway. We followed her 10 minutes down the freeway and she almost hit two cars, eventually she hit a guard rail blowing out her tire. She gets off the next exit and at the stoplight Zack gets out, runs to her car pounding on her window and she skirts around the corner.  She drives over a center divider, rocks going everywhere and dirt in the air, she pulls into a Chevron and we park right behind her. Zack runs back up to her car and rips the door open and was like what the fuck are you doing?! Ironically one of our other junkie friends was at the gas station too and he and his girlfriend walk up and think we hit this girl in a fender bender? All these nosy people come up and think it was a fender bender but they leave after we tell them we got this handled. 

This one chick stayed behind to help out. We find out there‚Äôs a service dog in the vehicle and that‚Äôs when I got really mad. This girl was blonde, had tattoos, total Cali girl cause that‚Äôs where we are. She try‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs from Istanbul, speaking Spanish with a British accent. Yeah, I‚Äôm not even fucking joking üòÇ this bitch wasn‚Äôt even making sense. She was saying they don‚Äôt have center dividers in her country lol and trying to convince us that she was foreign so bad. The girl who stayed back to help was calling her own AAA to get the car towed but the drunk driver was pretending she didn‚Äôt know the address. She just kept spurting out numbers in Spanish with her British accent. The drunk girl is now just saying random stupid shit trying to say her fianc√© is on his way and he owns a taxi company. I tell the girl who stayed back she can leave we got it handled. 

At this point I‚Äôm so close to knocking this chick the fuck out. She‚Äôs just saying all this dumb shit and she walks up to Zack and hugs him and says Te Amo. Then she proceeds to do that to me but kisses me on my face and says Te Amo. She goes up to my boyfriend and hugs him and says Te Amo. We ask her about her service dog and we let it out of the car. Her dog was 3 and it was so skinny it looked starving! It was so fucking sad. I just walked away after this because I was about to knock her out. Only reason I didn‚Äôt was because cops kept driving by. Eventually I look out the car window when I‚Äôm in the car and I see Zack and my boyfriend talking to a cop. I get out and walk up to them. The cop asks if any of us would give a written statement. Zack apologizes to the cop and says sorry officer I just dont give info to cops I hope you understand. I volunteer and tell him I‚Äôll give one. I follow him to his cop car and he asks me what happen and I start writing the statement. Cops give her a sobriety field test and she‚Äôs failing terribly. She‚Äôs lying and still going with her story. I overhear the cops saying there‚Äôs also a cat in the car! Jesus Christ poor animals. There‚Äôs 5 cops there and finally a 6th comes with a blood testing kit cause she demanded them to test her blood. She gets cuffed and off to jail. Animals get taken to the shelter. We leave. We finally cop. 

Sidenote: I had two cousins suffer from drunk driving incidents. They were brother and sister. One cousin died on her way to prom when she was 18. She was passenger and the driver was drunk. My other cousin was passenger too. He was in a coma and has never been the same since. I got hit by a drunk driver just in October. He hit me three times! Totaled my car. I‚Äôm sorry if I sound like a square for being so emotional about drunk drivers but it‚Äôs just selfish. Don‚Äôt endanger people‚Äôs lives because they didn‚Äôt ask to die or get hit by you. That‚Äôs so selfish to me. If I can interfere and stop a drunk driver from killing or hurting someone I will and I don‚Äôt care if that‚Äôs being lame. ",1517908784.0

Today's attempts at pulling extra moves to raise bail money were, ya know... they were a complete disastrous failure. Ended up runnin around with 2 homegirls. One of them needed to go get a laptop charger from her mom so we're hangin in the parking lot. She ran out shortly after because she has a no contact order with her mom so her mom called the cops. Okay whatever let's go get that money your uncle owes you from like a year and a half ago. Suprise! Another no contact order so another police unit called. Let's just stay out of town for now, yeah? So we go to this fucking farm that she has a bed at that I had no clue about. It was beautiful, so beautiful she wanted to stay. Whatever I'll try to pull moves with this girl instead. We take off back toward town but take a path slightly away from town into an area I basically don't know whatsoever. I ask her where the fuck we're going.

""We're going to church, bud.""

""Uh okay right except fuck that. I'll catch flame just by looking at a church."" 

She insisted I had the wrong idea even though I was pulling into the parking lot of what was obviously a fucking church with like church people and shit. My sense of logic is yelling at me - Uncharted territory uncharted territory, abort abort. But ya know when do I listen to that fuckin noise anyway? I'm still alive so it must be wrong. We go around the front of the church and down these little steps that lead to a lowered section on the outside leading to one disgusting looking door. Like that shit was gonna crumble into termites at the next knock. So she knocks like 7 times with decent force until the lock turns. 

This incredibly hospitable pastor opens the door and let's us in. This is the basement of church, I don't know what the fuck was going on upstairs because it's a monday, but it was some sort of church function that he had to get to. My peripherals are showing other people around me, but my focus is on this god damn pastor. He was so nice and glowing . Spark in his eye, big warming smile, and so well spoken, especially when he introduces himself before asking me, ""You need any cleans, cottons, or alcohol wipes?"" 

What the fuck wait what. What? 

What? 

I tell him I'm all stocked up, thank you though. He smiles the kind of smile I would only Santa has. 

""Okay good, if you need anything have one of these guys text me, I gotta go upstairs."" And goes upstairs to do church shit. I look around at the surrounding people and it's all fellow tweakers and junkies sticking needles in their arms. It was fucking insane. I never thought I would ever experience something so controversial and dark yet amazing in my life. I'm not even mad I only made a total of 11 dollars today, all of which went into to the gas tank to do the driving to get the rest 11 dollars. Complete failure. 

But ya know, at least I went to church.",1517901275.0

I figured why not, and dropped him a messaged. 
We exchanged some messages/emails, and Iended up agreeing to do a phone interview,on the record. It was my chance to tell my story to their 30 million+ readers.  So we had the phone interview, and they decided that they(the 2 journalists) would like to fly out, and come do a face-to-face interview with me. 
It's not an American newspaper,but it was Suprisingly cathartic being given the chance to tell my story, And have someone really care what I said. Also,being given the chance to it only do that,but also give my opinions on the how and why....how we (as a country) got here, if we can recover,if so how in my opinion. They covered the local aspect of it as well....they were going to be speaking to some local government officials who line to pat themselves on the back for shutting down pain management doctors, and arresting horrible junkies, ECT. But whom I have a very different opinion of the role the local government played in shoving a lot of people towards the streets for drugs, who otherwise may have never gone that route. 
Its not a big deal, but like I said it was kind of cathartic for me.....if my story stops even one person from fojbg down the same road as I've been on,then it was worth it, I think.

I've lurked here for quite some time now, this is my first time posting, on anything on reddit in general, and I've been on here for years. 

I've been consistently taking opiates for 4 and a half years up until this point. 
Not gonna bore you with my life story but for a little background, at age 14(in 2009) I got drunk for the first time. Two weeks after that I tried adderall. Then xanax. I tried percosets and vicodin at this age too, but didn't really enjoy them that much, they made me throw up mostly and I thought the high was uncomfortable. I fell in love with xanax and was pretty bad on them throughout the rest of high school and beyond. After I graduated, I tried coke, shrooms, molly, ecstasy and drank pretty regularly.
In 2013 my mom got diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver(she was an alcoholic my whole life), was given 6 months to live, and was perscribed vicodin, via hospice.
I was in such deep pain, I just started taking them. Everyday. It was free, no one noticed any ever went missing, and when the script ran out they were delivered to our door step the next morning, free of charge. 
I never liked them until it was the only thing really making me feel slightly okay with having to deal with my mom being terminally ill.
So obviously I became mentally and physically dependant on them, she ended up living for a year and two months. I had quit on my own one month prior to her death.
The longest I went off of them was 3 months, in 2013/beginning of 2014 (2 months after my mom died)
When I relapsed, I tried roxys for the first time. It was a suggestion of my girlfriend at the time, who did roxys years back a lot recreationally. She wanted them for her birthday.
I blew my entire tax check on them and the rest is history.
I continued to do any type of pill I could get my hands on, or afford. Percs, vics, but I especially loved roxys.
As the years when on I got worse and worse on pills and basically all my money went to them.
Toward the end of 2017 I tried heroin for the first time. I loved it. I did that for months between pills also. (only snorted heroin, never IVed anything)

And now that leads us to right now.
Last Saturday was my first time off pills in my most recent several months binge, and as of right now it's been a full nine days. The first two days were brutal, and I was staying with a friend of mine who helped me through it. She refused to give me xanax or anything but ibuprofen to ease the WDs. At first I was pretty angry about it but in retrospect I'm happy she didn't cause I remember every detail of how awful it was and I'm glad. 

I've tried and failed quitting so many times. Never could really go passed 7 days clean. Boredom is my biggest problem sometimes. 
Also, this is the first time I've quit for myself.

I'm not in NA, but I've been before and I think I'll try again. 
Towards the end I was very suicidal and even with my drugs, I didn't really wanna get out of bed most days. I was sick of myself and what I had become. I was sick of hurting people over the years with my addiction. 

I gotta say since the WDs have stopped, I've been so much happier. I haven't felt this generally good in a long time. Without my crutch. I am still mourning it though, I do still crave it, and God do I miss it. 

I've been taking it day by day, and I truly do not want to go back to that. I want to continue to be free from its shackles, I've felt like a fucking slave for years, because I have been.

Sorry for the long post..I mostly did this as my own personal therapy, to extract all these thoughts out of my head.

Being off of opiates has so many more pros than cons, I finally wake up and feel normal. I'm not sick, I'm not instantly getting up to pop a pill or snort h, just to feel normal. 


If you actually read this, thank you and thank everyone on this sub. I hope everyone stays safe out there, and if you want to quit..it's so fucking worth it. 
I hope I never fall back into its clutches.",1517899536.0

I have a chronic illness that causes my joints to dislocate frequently. I am in a ton of pain all the time and because of these dislocations, I end up getting major orthopedic surgery very frequently. We are talking 3-7 surgeries every year.

My doctors are very cautious about prescribing me any sort of pain medication (even getting stronger anti-inflammatory medications can be a challenge). However, when I get surgery, I typically get prescriptions for whatever I need. I'm in the military which has random drug tests and I need a recent prescription to be able to keep my job, so this is very important and legality is also an issue.

Here are my biggest issues that I need help with because I can't keep living like this: 

1. I have an addictive personality. I can become addicted to random stuff like video games and cake without any issues. I know for sure I would have an alcohol issue, so I just don't keep it around my house. Here's the problem: I get major surgery and get worried I'm going to get addicted. I debate whether or not I should use the pain killers *at all*. Typically, I stop taking them after 48 hours or so, even though I'm in agonizing pain and essentially only sleep when I physically pass out. My doctor asks me to please take the meds for 2 weeks or longer, but in the past, I knew it was going to be a problem MUCH before that  - and I know he wouldn't help me with the aftermath.

How can I conservatively use these medications without causing a ton of issues for me in the future? I mean, there has to be some happy medium between not using them at all and becoming addicted, but I just don't know how to gauge it.

2. When I do take the meds for more than a couple days, I need to be able to work from home because I don't have enough time off work to go to physical therapy and recover. However, I CANNOT for the life of me stay awake for more than a few hours at a time when I take even a basic dose of Percocet. I alternate with an NSAID, but even caffeine can't keep me awake/alert. I only take one pill every 8 hours or so... Any suggestions?

3. Tramadol does nothing for me. At all. No pain relief or anything, which is surprising because other opiates knock me on my ass. Is this common? How do you suggest that I communicate this problem since doctors feel like Tramadol is the only thing that they can safely prescribe WITHOUT sounding like I'm a drug seeker?

4. How do you deal with family and friends that act like you're subhuman for using these medications? If I tell people I can't drink beer because I'm on Percocet, my friends act like I need to go to AA and need an intervention. I can't help but feel dirty when they react this way.

5. Constipation, lack of hunger, and sex drive - any advice here? I sometimes don't eat for 24 hours or longer when I'm on them.

This issue will never go away and will just get worse with time, so I want to be able to have as healthy of a relationship with these meds as possible.

I appreciate your help.",1517892114.0

> Heroin has no medical benefit

Actually, heroin has huge medical benefits and is one of the most innocuous drugs out there. It is used in most countries under it's generic name diacetylmorphine or diamorphone. ""Heroin"" is a brand name patented by its creator the Bayer corporation (yeah, the aspirin guys) in 1892 or so. About the only physical effects it has on a person is constipation.

Now, the risk of addiction and possible overdose is really bad, but the main problem with overdose is the inability to get anything where you have any idea whatsoever the potency (that and the dealer fuckwits are cutting EVERYTHING with fentanyl nowadays make it a serious gamble.

But, that just proves my point. Put supply under the purview of the FDA or some such so that addicts can get a consistently reliable product where they know the strength and know there are no adulterants. That right there would eliminate the VAST majority of overdoses (trust me, most addicts have damn near Doctor of Pharmacology level knowledge of their drug of choice).

As far as a rise in addiction? Nope... if heroin was legalized tomorrow and you could go down to the corner market and get some would you? I would bet my life that will be a no. Neither will the VAST majority of people. Education is what we need. How many new smokers are there every year? Not a lot. Why? Because of the education today's youth has regarding it's dangers. Kids, for the most part, aren't stupid regarding such things.

Anyone else that takes up the habit voluntarily will do so regardless of the criminal consequences.

The vast majority of new addicts are a direct result of the actions of doctors over prescribing opiates. Now they are trying to close that barn door by shutting shit down totally and leaving Jenny Johnson from the 'burbs with a raging percocet addiction in a world of shit. Once the dope sick hits her (or anyone honestly) they are going to do whatever is necessary to ""get well"".

Usually (or in my case) the steps are:

* Multiple doctors in different areas 
* Faking pain in local ERs 
* Forging scrips or begging for friends/family's leftovers or having them fill their unwanted scrips for you
* Straight stealing friends/family's scrips
* Finding an illicit seller of pills
* Figuring out the going price for pills is $1/mg and realizing heroin is much cheaper (your pill supplier usually informs you of that)
* Snorting/smoking heroin
* Realizing you are wasting too much that way and the effects take too long to arrive
* Asking your dealer for a clean rig and crossing the line into IV use
* Not having a clean rig so you reuse old ones
* Your old one's needle is so dull it doesn't work or it plugs/breaks
* You borrow your ""friend's"" rig because of course they are clean... you wouldn't hang out with some diseased person right?
* You just don't give a fuck anymore and your life is off the rails
 
I understand you are a bit naive regarding this stuff. I was too. But would you go to a brain surgeon for a heart transplant? No. Brain surgeon isn't dumb, he just doesn't know much about heart transplants.

So. let the experts handle this. Pretty much every expert in the field of addiction medicine and social work agrees harm reduction and the end of the drug war is the ONLY answer to this absolute nightmare we find ourselves in/

We are very slowly moving in the right direction. but a staggering amount of lives are going to be lost before anybody in power gets their head out of their ass and fixes this shit

Peace y'all

Edit: Oh, BTW, this was in response to the following I wrote about how we can fix the ""opiate crisis"". She disagreed and said ""heroin is too dangerous"" to unleash on the virgin populous of our great country.

>I subscribe to the [Portugal method](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it) of dealing with addiction and all the bullshit that accompanys it.

>Decriminalize everything across the board. Keep dealing and trafficking where it is at.

>If a person is caught with a drug of some sort, write them a summons to appear before a Legal professional (judge), medical expert (in addiction medicine) and some sort of social work expert.

>If the user can demonstrate that they use responsibly (they hold down a job, don't rob people, are generally not hairballs) then they go on about their business. If their live is off the rails then they are ordered into state-financed treatment based on current addiction medicine protocols (no bullshit AA/NA... I'm talking CBT and individual life skill, financial and related therapy).

>Pay for all of this with the money you save not locking people up for what has been proven to be a legitimate medical/psychiatric issue and not continuing this idiotic ""war on drugs"".

>Allow users to obtain pharmaceutical grade drugs from a licenced or otherwise government run source.

>Drug cartels will collapse overnight. Billions in wasted money saved, police, court, social service and emergency medical providers will be freed up to concentrate on the real problems.

Seems simple to me.

I always thought I had hit rock bottom before and truly understood what it meant to be there. When I was an IV heroin addict 3 years ago and was homeless with no place to go, I thought that was my rock bottom. When I relapsed after a year and 4 months sober and lost everything I worked hard to get back in that time in just two weeks I thought I hit rock bottom. I have been clean off opiates for over 6 months now, and 2 months off suboxone. So what‚Äôs the problem you might ask? I tried crack cocaine for the first time 3 weeks ago and have lost complete control of my life. The reason I say I am truly at my lowest point in my life is because I know now it‚Äôs not the material things that you lose or don‚Äôt have anymore. I have worked really hard to get where I am now. I live in a gated community that is 20mins away from the one of the nicest beaches in the east coast, I have a job that I actually enjoy going to work everyday, and most importantly a fucking amazing and supportive girlfriend and group of friends and family. I had to earn a lot of trust back and trust me it took a lot of time. I got hooked on crack when I went to my dealers house to grab some vyvanse and they asked if I messed with it. I had only tried crack three times in my life before then and it was back when I was using heroin and never thought it wasn‚Äôt all that great. Long story short, here I am 3 weeks later and I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äôll get two days sober and then have dreams about it where I can feel like I‚Äôm actually high in my dreams then I wake up craving it. I told my girlfriend and my best friend the truth about everything last weekend, after I had a mental breakdown high off crack and tried to get in a high speed chase I hit 132mph in my mother‚Äôs Mercedes while crying hysterically. I pulled over to the side of the road and just started praying for help. I had 4 days sober after that, then bought a 30 sack after I had a couple drinks at an oyster roast. I know I‚Äôm being so selfish and I know I‚Äôm on the verge of losing everything that I‚Äôve worked so hard for in my life, but I am completely broken. I don‚Äôt even enjoy getting high anymore, all it does is cause me anxiety, but I can‚Äôt fucking stop. On top of it all I have type B strain flu virus, and I know smoking this much is just making me more sick.

Plus your WD will be much worse when you're shooting, since your body absorbs more dope due to bioavailability and therefore your habit is more severe. 

It's just more fun. Smoking dope is a casual affair, watch some TV while chasing the dragon, just chillax. Whereas shooting would always end with me tearing my jugular open and dousing myself in blood like some pagan blood priest.


Anyway, /rant. I wish you guys all the best, I'm feeling myself with this amazing Afghan shit, hence my being so chatty. Greetings from the other side of the pond",1517871022.0

So here it goes. I've been using opiates sense I was mid 20s. Not I'm mid 30s. I'm going to fast forward to heroin. I was using about 2 grams a day by IV. I couldn't afford to. Couldn't ¬†keep up with it so I got put on methadone. Of course I still used heroin but now I was only using heroin once a day for the most apart. Unless l had extra money then j would use more. It helped because methadone keeps me from having to stay well all day and night. But I'm at 65 mg so by the night time sense I dose in the morning I start to feel crappy. This is when I usually do my shot. I'm from the west coast and all we get out here is tar. I wanted to try all the other types dope I had heard about. Plus I was having to shoot a half a gram of tar to blast thru the methadone. So I started getting interested in the dark net and the dark net markets. So much tasty looking things on there. East coast powder dope. Golden triangle pure powder. Etc etc. But dark net markets take bitcoins which to me looked like a pain in the ass to get at that time. 

I use to do surveys online to buy cool shit with the gift cards you can chose to cash out in. So I bought things like a PS4. A 55k 4k tv etc etc. Then one day I stumbled upon a survey site that had a higher payout system then the other I was using and surprise surprise. They paid out in Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash etc etc. I was excited. Fast forward to now. ¬†I make about 400-500 a month on my survey site. Which I use to buy my dope online. I've tried all kinds and had some really good stuff before. I ran across a listing once for synthetic heroin. When I read the feedback people where saying it was super strong and it was free to sample so I decided to try it out. When it came I was super careful as everyone said how strong it was. I put maybe about a quarter of a match head in the spoon and did it up. It was so strong I was scared I was going to OD. That .1 sample ended up being 10 doses for me. So it went a long way. Now I'm at the point where I buy a .3 or .5 every week and a half it I love it. I like it because it doesn't fuck up my veins. It's like shooting water. With black tar seems like I fuck a vein up and soon as I use it. On this stuff I can use the same vein over and over and be cool. I do try regular dope from time to time when like a new vendor will pop up with some good sample deals and I'll buy some stuff. The really really good pure powder heroin online is like 200 bucks a gram and that is why I mostly stick to my synthetic heroin which I know is a fent analog but at least it's a good one with nice rush and legs as well. ¬†I can say if I use too much of it for like days straight then my tolerance goes up and I have to slow down so my tolerance slows back down. For anyone that messes with any kind of fent read about what your doing and what the chemical does to you as well first. ",1517863729.0

I Just got surgery few weeks ago and got my first bottle oxycodone 5/325, i used as much as i needed for the pain; usually one, sometimes 2, ans a couple times 3. I took 15mg with 50mg benadryl last sunday  the on 4th. It felt good. like never smoke weed good, i could feel the nod but i can resist falling asleep and the feeling dissipates as i focus. Anyways...

I have 6 left and i don't think 3 is enough. 4 or 5 would leave with leftovers. So i want to take em' all.

so the plan is 30mg oxy, along with some potentiators:
 25mg meclazine
200mg aleve
beef patty with cheese
grapefruit juice
15 ml dayquil

I just want to know if im safe to go for it. im not sure if the jump from 15mg to 30mg would be too much, nor am i familiar with how potent they can get.

Fresh out of three weeks of treatment, got high twice in the past week but I'm hanging on.  I'm putting all types of barriers between me and the block but reality is daily I still want to get high and it's a struggle.  I'm losing and have lost all the things that really matter to me.  Deep down I do want to stay clean it's just the daily struggle that trips me up.  Anyway if you're withdrawaling now or in the early days/months of recovery it could always be worse.

Story goes like this...I had recently been arrested, lost like my 8th apartment and was stuck moving back in with my folks who were still together at the time for like the tenth time in a 6-7 years.  My dad's the controlling type but really cares and what's to find whatever would work for me.  Now I had been on n off the Vivitrol shot for a couple years at this point.  Before this latest attempt at getting clean my parents said I wasn't living there unless I was on it.  So not being built for hovering over candles in the bando (I've been there too) I agreed.  I was on a pretty vicious year or so long run at this point.  I agreed to check in to detox and thought I'd be fine with just that cuz my family was going to the shore the following week.  That week-10 days would get the methadone taper out of my system and be good for the shot.  Well instead of staying clean that week I decided to drive to Kensington every single day to get high and came back to the shore like nothing happened.  I did this for the next seven days.  On the day of the shot my ex and I drove separate from my dad back home to get the shot.  He had to witness me get it or wouldn't believe me.  So I figured this is gonna suck but I don't wanna be homeless I'm gonna get it regardless.  Then as we're driving down the expressway I thought hell I got high the past 7 days what's the difference if I get high 45 minutes before this thing, might as well relax till I get there.  So I lost my dad in traffic stopped in the hood, got high and proceeded to the office, arriving like ten minutes after my dad.  I went in pissed hot, they made me sign a waiver saying I was gonna get really sick.  I signed it and got the shot.

Worst mistake of my life.  People talk about precipitated withdrawal from subs, I've been there, it's that times 1000.  I got five minutes from the office with my girl driving and instantly started throwing up till it was bile then dry heaving.  My anxiety and hot n cold sweats were so bad I was kicking the windshield.  I never contemplated suicide till that moment.  I almost threw myself into traffic.  I told my girl to turn around and take me to the hospital.  The hospital sat me in a wheelchair and took my blood pressure. ""Oh it's raised a little bit, wait here""  Hunny I don't have time to wait I wanna die, shoot me up with some ativan or thorizine or I'm out.  They didn't like that.  I called my Dr. who just gave me the shot n said I had no idea it'd be this bad you gotta fill me a script of something.  He called in a script of 15 librium.  I know librium, I took 12 of the 15 at once on a completely empty stomach.

Now it was time to drive back to the shore.  But wait I'm gonna be out of librium in another hour what then?  I told my girl yo you gotta stop in the hood I need xanax.  Next thing I remember she's hitting me not knowing where to cop bars.  I tell her and fade out.  I wake up on the bridge, tell her to turn around, I fade out again.  This went on for about another three times before I finally woke up down the shore with 0 librium left feeling like death.

The next five days were spent not moving from the couch, trying to down what little bit of bacardi n coke I could stomach and smoking as much weed as possible to take the edge off.

TLDR: Don't ever take the vivitrol shot unless you're pissing clean, no matter what the consequences.  Homeless would have been the far better option.  Moral is it could always be worse when you're withdrawaling, 90% of it is mental.  Just really hard to convince yourself that.",1518030869.0

The end. Tell me what you think of the poem at the end, I‚Äôm genuinely interested in feed back. 

I made all the classic mistakes, I let my money walk, I let my CAR walk at one point (it did come back though), I trusted the strange dude who my middle introduced me to instead of her when I knew she could be trusted. I bought his uncle beer? And then rented a room in my name that he barely used? He kept disappearing or sending me to go get someone instead of getting down to business which should have been obviously shady. He made himself out to be a trustworthy dude but he kept trying to make me doubt my middle (call her K), should have been wary of that. Everything took like 3 or more hours to get nothing done. Wasted a lot of gas and in the end I had no choice but to go home, leaving him with the money and her screwed over because she was gonna use the money I gave her for all this to flip some shit and make her way back home to Cali to see he husband. She showed me a picture of him. I know she‚Äôs trustworthy, she was dragging me all over the place trying to find them and my money before I had to go. She wanted to kill them. She was crying because she was screwed now but also in a mothering way because  I hadn‚Äôt listened and got fucked over. I set her up in the room the guy had me rent for the night though, got a new key. I gave her the cash I had left save what I needed for tolls to get home. She had taken the guys laptop as collateral against anything happening to me at one point, which has me concerned for her safety, though I didn‚Äôt get the impression these people were violent and she‚Äôs been homeless for like 10 years so she‚Äôs street smart but still. I told her to try and trade the laptop for the drugs and fuck it she can have half of them, but only if it wasn‚Äôt putting her in danger, otherwise she should just give it back, I don‚Äôt care about the money or the drugs at this point, just that she‚Äôs safe. I‚Äôm gonna try and help her get across country in time to see her husband for his birthday. I‚Äôm gonna buy her a below freezing sleeping bag that she needs. She read my palm and told me I‚Äôm very creative but that I don‚Äôt use it enough, I have a strong work ethic but I don‚Äôt apply it to my hobbies, that I‚Äôve had some trauma and it affected me greatly and that I have a complicated life, all true things. She said I was a pretty man, with a kick ass beard. People compliment my beard all the time but no ones ever called me pretty. I showed her the text I had gotten the night before from the woman I‚Äôm in love with who told me clearly, that though she values our friendship a lot, in the end the only people she ‚Äòneeds‚Äô are her husband and daughter, things I already knew deep down but didn‚Äôt want to admit to myself. She was sympathetic, and she advised I distance myself from her which is going to be so hard. She gave me a little gold plate of mother Mary for good luck even though she wasn‚Äôt Christian and I wasn‚Äôt catholic but we both agreed on the same opinion regarding organized religion. We also both learned our favorite candy is sour patch kids, go figure. She says we‚Äôre gonna be good friends, something she doesn‚Äôt really even believe in. I told her I believe in true friends but not that everyone will find true love, which she does believe because she has found it. We‚Äôre gonna be good friends. It was all over several scripts of lortabs and a g of heroin. I made a 3-1/2 round trip to get it and I don‚Äôt even know in the end if anyone even had it cause I never saw it. Anyways, now I gotta face the music with my parents cause I told them what happened. I broke down and got scared when I thought my car was gone and told them what happened. It was getting late enough that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stall for much longer and would have had to have had an explanation. More than anything they are happy I‚Äôm safe but there‚Äôs gonna be consequences, I don‚Äôt know what. 
Anyways, here‚Äôs a little poem I wrote the other night about the opiate experience after getting that text from Her that broke my heart and then getting high for the last time before I am now completely out of drugs, possibly for good. It‚Äôs probably overly melodramatic and inconsistent but whatever, I was high. 

The tin man was a fool:
From before the fall, it is that holy feeling we all search for; the orgasm in slow motion, the sunrise that brings light to the dark places and sends the shadows into retreat. Reminiscent of that moment before dawn, when everything was new. It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn‚Äôt ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you can almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in the sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven‚Äôt any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp that it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.

Losing weight is rough ever since I discovered opiates last January.  I barely eat due to appetite suppressant effects and neasea.  I went a month without weighing myself and using daily,  thinking I‚Äôll see a low number once I do..I didn‚Äôt lose anything,  heart crushed..major disappointment.  I ate only at night, some fruit, egg whites and cereal usually.  Opiates also give me energy,  walking is fun while high.  

I‚Äôm starting to count calories very recently..yesterday I had serving broccoli, egg whites with cream cheese.  That‚Äôs it..and some coffee creamer.  I didn‚Äôt lose. 

On a side note,  my opiate of choice doesn‚Äôt cause constipation.  I go several times in morning. 

I hate being sober,  the rush is only thing I look forward to.  Totally non functional without opiates.  

Idk I woke up shaking, blacking out and weak..stepped on scale..nothing.  

It was so easy before.  I didn‚Äôt have to be so strict and when I tried,  I seen results right away.

I‚Äôm at a lowish weight already so counting calories is necessary.  I‚Äôll continue and see where it gets me.

You can look at my user history if you wanna see that....its currently in the works. Until then, I've really enjoyed reading some of your stories, so I though I would share one of mine. 

I moved to Ukraine from the good Ol' USA a few years ago, just to get away from it all basically live a simple, work free life on the gov't check I was getting. So let me set the stage for you all.

I'm Hetmen. Ex-American soldier, who moved to his mothers homeland of Ukraine. I have quite a bit of family here and spend almost all my time with them. Typically they spend 3 to 6 months in a western country working construction (men) or as a nanny/live in nurse (women) then come back for about 6 months before they take off again. Me? I just drink and use everyday, babysit for family, help in the garden...basically chill. 

So my cousin, Oleg, gets this idea, he decides hes gonna rent out a little place, buy some video gambling machines and start a business..... As you can expect, the business doesn't work out on account of the fact that people have no fucking money to gamble with. Ahhhh, but where did Oleg get the start up money from? None other then the Ukrainian Mafia. I figure this is not my or my family's problem, surely Oleg will figure it out. Well, Oleg suddenly goes to Prague to work (this was over 3 years ago). 

A few month go by and I'm at my other cousin Lana's house just crushing some vareniki in her apartment when we hear the buzzer on her door go off. She picks up the phone to see who it is and a look of fear washes over her face. She says its the mafia guys looking for Oleg. She tells me they've come twice now looking for him. 

Me, being pretty high, drunk and full of dumplings, say I'll go down to talk to them. So I walk down to the entrance of her building and there are two normal looking guys in their mid twenties.

I ask them, in English, ""Whats up guys? Why are you bothering my cousin Lana while her husband is away (he was working in Lithuania) . They both looked at each other and smiled, then one, we'll call him Taras, says, ""Ohh so you are Oleg's Cousin. He said he had an American. You're the Cowboy."" I had no idea what this dude was talking about but I just went with it because I thought being called cowboy was kinda cool. Taras said ""Your cousin, Oleg, owes us about 270,000 Hryvnia"" (about 10,000 USD). I said  ""Yeah man that is a lot of money, but you need to find Oleg to get your money back, not his family, or friends because we had nothing to do with that bullshit. Last I heard he was in Prague, so maybe check there?"" I had quite a bit of liquid courage in me. Taras says ""Cowboy, in the United States, $10,000 is worth a shit car. Here, in Ukraine, its worth an entire life."" Now me, being drunk at the time didn't know that this dude was straight up threatening someones life, so  I was like ""yeah dude its a lot of money, good luck finding that dipshit"" 

I'll post part two about what the mafia guys did and how we got them their....Compensation.... if there is interest. happy nods friends. ",1518017032.0

Shit post, but I just have to get this out.","I haven‚Äôt told this to **anyone** yet, maybe some of you can give me some insight. I‚Äôve been floating around this sub for almost a year. I‚Äôm not a huge poster or commenter, but a few of you may remember me as the chick that has been on dialysis forever, opiates even longer, have myself endocarditis from shooting into my dialysis fistula and now my husband keeps my med looked in a safe. He gives them out daily and I save my roxys and Xtampzas up for a week and have happy time on weekends (I don‚Äôt shoot anymore). 

I was finally put on the transplant list a month ago after being on dialysis for eight years. I had hoped to have my surgery by the end of this year. That‚Äôs why I was shocked to get a call yesterday from my coordinator saying they had a possible match. I was surprised it was so fast, but so happy. Then she told me the kidney was from a young adult, was a match for my blood type and the person had never had any major illnesses or surgeries. It sounded good. Then, the coordinator said ‚ÄúThe kidney cannot be classified as completely healthy. The person was exposed to HIV and/or Hep‚Äù. She told me they had run and rerun several tests and they had come back negative. It was showing that it was perfectly healthy. But, it couldn‚Äôt be listed as healthy. I turned it down and began the ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù and the ‚Äúwas I right?‚Äù  

I knew that because I had only been on the transplant list for a month that I was not the first (or probably in the first 20) person they called. The more I thought about it, the more things I realized. 

The donor was a very young adult and the coordinator said that the kidney had not been in any major accidents (of course she couldn‚Äôt specify and probably shouldn‚Äôt have even told me that). But, the HIV/Hep designation would come from IV drug use. And then, because I knew the donor was not living, I realized that this was most likely an OD. I called my Nephrologist‚Äôs office and spoke to his nurse. She said that I was probably going to get many calls about potential matches with HIV/Hep kidneys from OD‚Äôs and that I needed to wait for a healthy kidney. She said the numbers of these types of donor kidneys (OD khave gone steadily up over the past five years. She told me that it would not be held against me to pass on these types of kidneys, especially because I am young and even the healthiest in transplanted kidneys only last for 20 years at the most. 

Last night I began to feel awful. This young person had made the decision to give the most wonderful gift of organ donation. Or, this person‚Äôs heart broken parents made an incredible choice to donate their son‚Äôs or daughter‚Äôs organs. Either way, the family wanted to help another person have a new life through this amazing sacrifice. And now, so many of us were turning it down. 

I never knew this person, I knew nothing about them. But I found myself thinking about what kind of life they had. What kind of things did they like? What kind of music, movies and food? Why did they start shooting? Were the alone and sad? My heart was heavy because I wished I could thank them for their incredible donation. I wanted to tell the family what a wonderful and brave gift they had given. I actually began to cry when I thought about the mom (I‚Äôm a mom myself and I couldn‚Äôt imagine how hard this must be) and Dad must be going through. üòî

Although the situation surrounding the death of this young person might be something other than an OD from IV drugs, it‚Äôs unlikely after putting together all the facts. I will get many potential matches from OD deaths. It is heartbreaking to me. I just want everyone to stay safe, keep narcan on hand, and party with a buddy. This sub is awesome!",1518014840.0

I know the kratom isn't gonna be nearly as good as subs, but it's all I can get... 

Anyone out there get off a heroin habit as bad or worse as mine with kratom ?

The caddy corner house shields our driveway from the road. Well, I guess two people decided our driveway would be the perfect place to shoot up. 

Now, onto the situation. My husband was taking our dog outside, and he saw the car. The car was off, so my husband walked up to it. While walking up to the car, he noticed cigarette butts which he took to mean they‚Äôd been there for a while. Inside, he saw two men sleeping. The driver was bleeding from three different pricks in his arm. My husband tried to wake up the driver, and he would not wake up. The driver only woke up after my husband had our dog bark. The driver woke up, turned the car on, and sped off.

I go through the backpack this morning to find them and to verify that they are in fact her girlfriends. Turns out her mom moved the cards, so I didn't find those, I did however find my own mothers debit card, my bank card, and a couple other items of mine with value. My legs became weak and my ears started ringing. I tell her girl what's up. A little while after she called me from jail asking if I found the cards and when I can bail her out.

We have to be very careful what content and discussion that we allow on this subreddit if we want it to stick around for another 8 years.

We have the rules that are in the sidebar for very good reasons, most of them are pretty obvious: the longevity of this community, your safety, right to not be harassed, legal reasons, and so forth. Our major concerns at this current time are sourcing and locations issues, these have been identified as *the* reasons that these other subreddits have been shut down. Our job as moderators is hard enough as it is, we ask that everyone follows the rules to the best of their abilities at all times.

I am going to clearly define when you can post something about your location.

* **Countries** are always acceptable to speak about.

* **Large regions** are always okay. e.g. Great Lakes, New England, southwest.

* **States** are *not* acceptable when talking about dope porn or not being able to find a connect. They are okay when talking about harm reduction issues or very general topics.

* **Cities** are **never** allowed unless it is a fentanyl warning, the post will then be moderated accordingly.

* **Streets** are **never** acceptable.

* **Neighborhoods** are **never** acceptable.

* **GPS coordinates** - you work for the NSA and you are a cop, never acceptable.

-----

**Sourcing**

From the sidebar:

> No sourcing! Sourcing is any post regarding the acquisition of drugs, including legal substances, from a specific person or place, including other subreddit members, online markets, and/or vendors. Posts about finding people in your city/state will be deleted and a ban may be issued. 

I feel like that is very clear. If it needs clarified any further, this is the time and the place.

----

We want this community to stick around, there is not another one like it. I know many people would be devastated to lose it and the relationships they have built, so we all need to work together. There is the report button that is below every post and below every comment, please use it when necessary. We have many systems in place to help us deal with these problems, but we don't see everything.

People that break the rules will be dealt with accordingly. Most all of the people that post here regularly are super awesome and follow all the rules all the time, it is just that 1% that can take this place away from us.

Thanks for your time, help, and understanding folks!

- Kick


----

FashionablyFake:

I also want to add, about locations: hinting about them is still not okay. If your goal is for someone else to be able to tell where you live, that's the same as naming the city itself.

No location-specific posts! This includes neighborhoods AND cities. Anything that identifies a specific location will be removed. States can not be mentioned when posting dope porn or when talking about not having any sources. üê¢ üçÅ

Dumb Decisions Leading To Other Dumb Decisions.,"So I will say quickly that I relapsed a couple months ago. It sucks, but that's life and I'm not going to sit here and dwell on it. I just feel like an asshole for all the encouraging words I used to leave on other people's posts and the advice I reached out for in other subs when trying to stay clean...and then I relapsed, but here we are and here I am. So I quit my job about a month ago because I was being dumb (yet again) but was able to get my job back and I start back tomorrow. WELLLL.... I went and took out a cash advanced (because I burned through my savings after quitting my job) so I could get straight two days ago. I figured I would just pay it back when I got paid, no biggie. I JUST realized that the cash advanced is due THE DAY of the next pay cycle at work (the 15th) and that I probably wont get put back into the system in time for me to get paid on the 15th...
So now I am sitting here, thinking I will probably have to pawn my laptop so I can get the money to pay the cash advanced so the check I wrote the C.A. place doesnt bounce.
But then the addict in me knows I will most likely take that pawn money and go get straight with it and not pay the cash advanced place at all...
Or maybe I can pay off the cash advanced and then get another one after paying that one?
I dont know. Im really angry at myself.
Sorry for using this as a diary but like FUCK.
I need to pay off that C.A...but I also want pandas :(

7vqnlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vqnlf/using_subs_to_help_detox/,7,https://redd.it/7vqnlf,harea123,Using subs to help detox.,"So I have a couple of questions about using subs for detox and was wondering if anyone could help me out.

First a little bit of background, been using opiates on and off for about 3 years, with my using turning heavy in the last year. I will typically go on 2-4 week binges, withdraw and binge again. Before Christmas I overdid it with Tianeptine sulfate and experience awful withdrawals (I have heard it has some of the worst) thankfully I managed to make it through them, but it almost cost me my sanity. 

Of course after that I vowed never to take opiates again, just a bit of kratom so that I could enjoy New Years eve, and not be feeling to terrible as I settled into my new job. Well that obviously didn't last long and I've been abusing a long last opiate daily/once every 2 days for a month and a half (equivalent to maybe 300mg morphine or more). . I know a month is not a long time, but I haven't fully withdrawn from opiates in over 6 months. The longest I have gone without is a week but I wasn't out of withdrawals then. 


I am positively terrified of the withdrawals, I am very bad at handling them. I have heard of using subs to help minimize withdrawal I know I will have to pay the price, and feeling shitty is inevitable. But I would love it even if they made them 50% more bearable. 

So my questions are:

1) Does a quick sub taper help at all?

2) What dose and for how long should I take them?

3) Does it not just push the withdrawal back a couple of days?

But any information or experience from anyone who has used subs during detox would be appreciated. 

TLDR: Been abusing an opiate with a long half-life. Wondering if subs could help minimize withdrawal. Wondering how much to take/how long for. Thanks!",1517951534.0

But since moving out here I've been incredibly bad at hitting myself, and tend to miss my shots more than actually hitting. Which sucks, feels like such a fucking waste. I'm actually smoking the rest of my shit right now because I missed my shot.

7vqihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7vqihd/in_regards_to_checking_for_fake_pills/,13,https://redd.it/7vqihd,dopiedude,In Regards to Checking for Fake Pills,"For those that ask, have you checked the search bar for what real ones should look like?  Call me crazy, but I feel like someone has come up with the idea of creating the guide of all guides to identify legit pills.  I could be wrong though.

All I'm saying is the general manner in which these posts are made are incredibly inefficient.  They may as well be spam at this point.  First off, any pill has the potential to be duplicated well enough to fool a trained eye.  It would actually be hazardous for someone to suggest your pill is legitimate just by looks alone.  We could only say in full faith that what you have is a real pill is if it were reagent tested, or straight from the pharmacy.  Also, not to mention most of the pictures users submit are blurry as shit, poorly lit, only a single side, etc.  The lack of elaboration on the pills other characteristics also prevents a more educated _guess_.  

So, I haven't looked myself because it wouldn't make sense for me to as a heroin  user, but if such a guide does not exist, we should put a comprehensive list of all available pills and make it a rule for users to check the list before making yet another redundant (or will be redundant when the guide is available) post on the subject.  

Another benefit would be that misinformation would less likely occur.  The guide could be revised, thus making it more trustworthy.

I've done a little bit of meth earlier, so this is just my two cents.  Of course still ask us if someone is unsure, but I'm sure the amount of these types of posts would be greatly reduced.

So I guess my question is....how much recreational value does medical marijuana have? The reason for my thinking for the switch is my health. I've been looking for an out, and I think may be it. 

My abuse of oxycodone is a stress/anxiety relief function. And help with sleep. So will marijuana do the same for relaxing and sleep and pain relief

Never did heroin. 200mg a day oxy for 2 weeks, then benzos/Kratom for 2 weeks in a cycle.

It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides‚Äô gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in a sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence.

Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool.

Which is more euphoric? Obviously both together is the most euphoric but which one used alone is more euphoric? which would you use for social anxiety like public speaking?

Which one is a better anti-depressant and Anti Anxiety? 

Personally I think Opiates are more euphoric. They seem to numb my emotions more, opiates make me feel good about doing nothing, stimulants make me feel good about doing things. To me, Meth doesn't feel euphoric on its own, it only makes doing things much more fun. It increases the reward of things like playing video games or cleaning the house. Heroin you can just sit there in a chair and feel good but doing things also feels good. Heroin you can relax or do things. Meth will make you do something. Same with Dextroamphetamine.

Hi all, had a few questions to anyone who has BOC online. Basically, just set up a checkings today with BOC and just set up an online account too. I know with Chase bank, there is a lot of fraud prevention steps to logging on online. For example, a new computer needs verification by email or text. Also, for example if I use my debit card to make a purchase over $XXX Amount, it will send an email over, etc, stuff like that.

The lady today helping me set up the account told me I need a smart phone to use BOC online but can use it at the computer so I was wondering how similar it was to Chase online banking. Is BOC linked to the email address like if its my first time logging on at a location, will I need to verify with code? Can I set up text alerts without a smart phone? (Like placing a number on the account for protection, like BOC will send a text with a code to me if any log in problems), or anything like that? Or is it simply, use your email and password at any desktop/location and you can log in to view your banking information? 


Thank you anyone who took their time to read and/or respond. Have a good day!!!

=================== Random Opiate story that was promised.======================

===================================================

(First time buying crap Heroin when studying abroad)


I use to study abroad in China (Guangdong Province) a few years back. I was sent there originally to teach English but the program I signed up for didn't provide me with the ESL classes/certificates when I got there so didn't end up teaching. I had an addiction (heroin, but loved blues and opanas) problem back in the US, and Overdosed twice in the 2 months prior to going so my parents/aunt put money together and signed me up for a semester to learn Chinese to give myself time to get back to normal. They thought the strict laws there would deter people from selling and especially me from using. But during the first semester, I somehow managed to get myself into a bunch of shit and addicted to H again. What fucking shit.

About a month into the semester, I was with my friend Tack who was a skinny Indonesian kid with a bunch of tattoos and a funny looking face, he told me he met some new friends who were going to the club and asked me to go. A club was popular place to go among the foreigners. It was around 7pm and we went first to meet up with his new friends he met. So we got to their apartment, and what do you know, 2 Frenchman. They were 2 brothers, Tom and Arthur. Their apartment was very very nice and expensive, even for regular foreigners it was pricey. I say this because 1 USD = 6.1 RMB the time I was there and the USD just went farther making it seem like you are richer, but this apartment was nice is all I am saying. Anyways, both of them spoke English well, and Tom actually went to Cambridge University in England. Tom was also studying at the same school me and Indo Tack studied at but he was also there working in Finance in one of the big companies there (hence the expensive aprtment). His brother Arthur was in town visiting because it was his birthday. 

So we are pregaming at their place since they bought some Chinese beer (Tsingtao) and had a bottle of some liquor i never seen before. I'm not a drinker so i got buzzed pretty quickly. I pulled Tom aside and asked him how long he was there for and if he liked to party a lot. He told me he'll smoke weed every once in a while and even found people with weed in China. I was trying to slowly push his buttons to see if he fucked with opiates, but he told me back in England he did Coke a lot. Anyways, I was thinking to myself I would be fine with Coke. I've only done it a handful of times but I wanted to feel good that night and weed doesn't do it for me. So I asked him straight up if he had any contacts that could hook me up with something.


So he said yeah he has a connect there and gave me his guys number and told me to call him. I called him up and the guy has an accent made it more difficult to understand, I don't want to steriolize  but it was an African dude. It took a few tries but i asked him if he had Heroin after trying to beat around the bush, and he said yea he does and its $600RMB for a bag. I asked him if that was a gram or what? But he didn't understand me and I still to this day don't know how they measured out the bags. The 600 came out to around $95 or round up to $100 USD so I was expecting something good. He told me he'd be over there in 20-30 minutes. 


So i didn't exactly tell Tom what I was buying, I think he thought it was weed, and for sure, Tom's brother and my friend Indo Tack had no clue and they were waiting to leave to go to the club but I was waiting on the dealer so i kept saying just wait a little longer wait a little longer. I'm not sure how long it took but he finally came thru and by this time it was maybe 8 or 9pm and was pitch black outside. We just met on the street because there was no where private we could go, and i asked him let me see it first and he said okay. I pull out the bag and opened it up and dipped my finger in for a taste, and although it was dark out, he's like man becareful here. And to this day I have no clue what I got, I don't know if it was heroin or what. I didn't know about Reddit then or thought I would be buying more, so I never thought to take a picture and save for later. But the supposely heroin was kind of small chunks of soft clay like texture kind of in the letter C. It wasn't powder by any means, but it had that vinegarish smell and in a way tasted a little bit like H or what i can remember it tasted when I was back in the US. I asked him 3 times, what is this shit, and he kept saying yes man it's heroin, it's heroin. Because of the taste and just wanting to feel something, i bought it anyways. 


By now, Indo Tack, Tom and Arthur are outside and say cmon let's go to the club. So while we wait for a taxi, i tell them hold on and run to a public bathroom toilet quick to try and snort some of what i thought was heroin. Of course, there were no American style toilets in the bathroom, you have to squat to shit, So i had nothing to place my Dope on where i can crush it up and make lines etc. so i close the whole door on the bathroom and just use the sink and hope no one comes in. Anyways, so like i said before, the dope wasn't powder, it was this strange substance, I still don't know how to describe. Only if I saw it again I would be able to know. But I dump out a little bit and use my card to try and crush it up and cut out a line. The dope didn't really crush, like it was clay like and just got smooshed when i tried pushing it down. But the taste and the smell was just too similar to what I remember of H, so i kept trying at it. Eventually, shit breaks alittle bit but not into fine powder. It's kind of like bigger chunks but it's the best i could do with the time so I snorted it and went back out to catch the taxi with my friends. 

5 or 10 minutes pass and there was definitely something in that shit i bought. The feeling came on strong, a little euphoric, but not that much, but I was feeling something. I don't know if it was a placebo effect, but I swore I felt a small head rush like when you do a line, and then in a good mood after that. Since it did the job, i never questioned it and did hit up the dude a few times after that. (He came with powder after that which more resembled H then that first time shit). So we went to the club and got mad drunk and i told Tom and Arthur what i got and they asked for a line lol. I told them exactly what i told you guys, it wasn't like normal dope and it has a strange texture and they didn't care. They snorted some and said they felt good too and we hopped clubs a few times and ended up going back at 7am. 


Anyways, sorry for the long rant, this was just the first time i picked up in a foreign county. Later on, i met a different dealer with 100 times better shit like AMAZING shit, and other things that happened to me, spent 2 weeks at a detox hospital (I was only foreigner in there), and it was mad strange there!, also saw a regular doctor who prescribed medicine for withdrawals, getting hooked onto sleeping medicine and not remembering a lot of stuff (Zopiclone/Ambien drugs), got into a street fight while waiting for my dealer, and had to do some grimy shit to get some money there, which i can tell these stories/or answer questions if anyone is interested.. only because this was mad long and kind of shitpost/rant, so i don't know if anyone actually read this. If you did, thank you!

He has never been to any drugs before besides marijuana and never taken opiates. He has definitely battled bad depression and also alcoholism (he was prob a ‚Äúfunctioning‚Äù alcoholic) this year. 

According to him he has only been on fentanyl for 3 months and was only shooting up at work (he works 3 days a week) and the most he did was 500 micrograms in one shift. I did catch him with a fentanyl in his pocket about a month ago which he said he returned to hospital (he now admits he actually used it) and also he admitted to injecting over Xmas when he was off work (so these kinda go against him saying he only used at work). Also besides fentanyl he said he just took 1 morphine XR one time and no pills besides that.  Like i said some of this doesn‚Äôt add up but he really has no reason to lie about it now. 

My question is do you think it is possible for this one 30 day stay in rehab to be enough to help him get sober? I have heard so many horror stories about multiple stays At rehabs not working. However, 3 months doesn‚Äôt seem that long, will that help? He definitely wants to get sober. ",1518084264.0

is there any hope that i can stop here, and prevent withdraws from starting over? i used such a minuscule amount of dope compared to my regular dose, that im hoping i continue foward without having lost all my progress. 

i cant remember the last time i felt this devastated in my life. i carved out a rare window of time from my job/ other obligations to get this behind me and i still manged to fuck it up. 

and an honest word of warning: as helpful as benzos can be, i can assure you that my resolve in the withdrawal process was as strong as its ever been, but it call came crumbling down after one two many xanax. 

anyways, sorry to ramble. is there any chance that my withdrawal will not start from the beginning? any response will be greatly appreciated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",1518084219.0

The story here is I used to be on 16 mg of Dilaudid daily (4mg x4 orally) for about 5 years due to a botched shoulder replacement, and a terrible car accident caused by my epilepsy. Last year I went cold turkey for about 6 months, but went from 8 hour work days to 1.5-5 hour days... :(

I would like to try the rectal route for Dilaudid, as I have heard it is a more potent level of delivery of oral, nasal, and subcutaneously. A 2 mg dose really is nothing...

Why Legalization of all Narcotics Benefits Everyone!,"I was inspired to write this essay upon a realization I received after reading this reply:

""..i wish dope was legal and fent wasn't an issue. In fact all drugs i wish were legalized and the money go to schools, rehabs, and anything else that can benefit society. Imagine if we took the taxes of drugs plus all the money spent to police them and spent it on making society a better place for all.""
~Ddddooope 
 
When Dddddooope made the connection between fentyal contamination as a product of criminalization, this realization dawned on me: 

All negative aspects (beyond the control of the user) is a result of The Criminalization of Narcotics period 


I believe future generations will reflect on the results of the prohibition of narcotics as a Holocaust. Not only as a transgression against the user & the addict, & their families but for everyone. 

The good news is we are on the tail end of prohibition. I believe in our lifetime drugs will be at least decriminalized (hopefully legalized).

People forget that The prohibition of alcohol required a constitutional amendment. Therefore the US Harrison Narcotics Act 1919 is 100% unconstitutional & total bullshit. 

If anything was learned from Alcohol prohibition, it was that prohibition doesn't work. Morality and Human Behavior cannot be legislatively fixed, and that when you prohibit something in strong demand it has the effect of concentrating power & money in the most ruthless suppliers. Which is the real reason behind drug prohibition. This created access to an unregulated source of bottomless fundraising for criminal elements of the power structure (e.g. CIA Iran contra etc.).

It's estimated that Heroin is a 2 to 4 trillion dollar a year market (tax free &w/out regulations) that's a lot of zeros:

$2,000,000,000,000 

Over 95% of world opium is produced in Afghanistan (post US invasion of course!) and 75% of that Afghan opium is converted into heroin in Pakistani labs. 

Please Don't get it twisted these Afghan Farmers are still poor AF and basically paid nothing. 

The real money is made somewhere downstream from the manufacturers and they have probably been cashing in for centuries (e.g. Skull&Bones Fraternity at Yale was created with Opium Money) 

On the Bright-side some European countries like Portugal have Decriminalized narcotic possession. Instead of arrest for those who are found in possession of illicit drugs, they are sent to a panel of health professionals that offer education and rehabilitation. 

The results of Portugals decriminalization proved unequivocally that drug decriminalization is beneficial to individual user &  the public health of Portugal. HIV/AIDS/Hep C across the board showed double digit % decreases. Although recreational drug use increased by 2-5% the overall rate of addiction dramatically decreased. Naturally Several other countries have followed Portugal example and universally showed positive results on both individually and societally.

Even some in the US have seen the light like Maryland in 2016 introduced a drug decriminalization bill(decriminalizing small,personal amounts), but it was voted down in the state house and not enacted into law but progress is progress

The legalization of recreational use of Marijuana has inspired hope in junkies like me that legalization of all recreational drugs is a possibility 

Full Legalization of Drugs should not seem radical, considering for millennia before 1919 essentially all drugs were legal and Human civilization progressed just fine(thrived even) with drugs legal. In fact in Ancient Rome it was considered a spiritual and narcotic use was encouraged during the end of year festival Saturnalia (the origin of a lot of Christmas traditions)

Truthfully it is an extremely  draconian to criminalize drug use. Attempting to legislate human morality or free will has be proven impossible every time it has been attempted.  

Furthermore the US Drug War has historically been more expensive then all other US Wars COMBINED! The ""War on Drugs"" Racks up federally $15 billion/year ($500 a second) since the Nixon Administration in the 1970s plus another $25 billion/yr from State and local governments. 

48 years x [($15b+25b)] = 
$1,927,000,000,000 

How many people could be sent to life saving rehabilitation with that money? How many people could that feed? How much Dope would that buy? 

 The result of trillions of tax pay dollars thrown at the drug war, and the people who are on the drugs have been ""winning"" because illegal drugs have never been more accessible than they are now. 

The demand for drugs will never, ever, ever(X infinity) go away regardless of legality, health risk, or price etc. therefore suppliers will always be willing to supply Drugs regardless of risk, legality, logistical difficulties, low logistical productivity etc.(to infinity). We know this to be true because of the continuous ingenuity of drug traffickers e.g. Narco Submarines, Narco Tunnels, etc. 

lt is important to note the negative ripple effect Drug Criminalization has on a macro & micro level, individual level & family and a governmental/societal/political level. 

The extent of the negative impact cannot be understated. 


 Drug Criminalization has had a disastrous effect on Narco Producing Countries in Central and South American: 
A historical example in Escobar's Columbia out of control hit men gunning down people in the streets, political bombings, lead to Chaos that spilled over into as automatic gunfire in Miami Malls. This continues today in Mexico  which has had Vietnam War level causalities/deaths because of out of control Narco Cartels who supply an out of control US demand for illegal drugs. 

When the Taliban Took power in Afghanistan after the 1980s USSR occupation. Opium production was nearly eliminated, but post US invasion opium production (protected and encouraged by the US Military & government) increased astronomically The result of this is a world-wide opiate pandemic. 
Historically invasion and control of Afghan Opium production seems to be a reoccurring ""Hail Mary"" pass for failing empires e.g. USSR 1980s British circa 1900. 

War and control of Narco Supply fit like hand and glove:

The British fought more than one hundred year long Opium Wars with China. Golden Triangle Heroin production during the Vietnam War. That became ""blue magic"" heroin in NYC. Amphetamine production by North Koreans and terrorist organizations like ISIS helps fund the most radical regimes. 

Again The negative impacts manifest everywhere on all levels of society. nowhere is unaffected from the negative impact of drug criminalization. 

As a global family we can not prevent addiction or outlaw it away. What we can do is control the way we as a society REACT  to the inevitability of addiction. 

It is a common misperception to place sole blame of these horrors on addiction itself; when it's our lazy and ignorant  ""throw them in jail"" mindset while trillions are made by ruthless suppliers and trillions spent on arresting low level users and sellers Is the cause of all these negatives . 

All of these negativities can be prevented by recognizing the problem, and taking action towards a solution.

The head of the hydra is our lack of oversight and regulation of the Narco Trade. 

It is harder for a teen to get Alcohol and Cigarettes than illegal drugs. 

This is because Alcohol /Tobacco:
#1.use is recognized as an inevitability and by nature ""unprohibitable"" (prohibition lesson learned)

#2 strict oversight/heavily regulated on all levels (its use,distribution, production , marketing, purity, qualities etc) 

#3 the public is educated about the risks (everyone knows cigs cause cancer & suppliers are required to disclose these risk clearly)

#4strict boundaries define extent of use,consumption, and interactions with society while under influence of effects. (Everyone knows not to drink and drive and everyone knows the consequences of crossing these boundaries, Also suppliers of Alcohol and Tobacco know the age requirements and the consequence of selling to under age) 

Additionally Alcohol and Tobacco generates tax revenue on a local, state, and federal level. 


Narcotics supply, consumption, production, and sale could be successfully regulated, oversaw, with clear set boundaries.

Quality and Purity would increase while price decreased. The BS of a sellers market would go away and accountability would reign! 

Almost overnight the negative ripple effects discussed above would decrease dramatically while public health would increase. 

I am sure there are a lot smarter people than me out there who don't spend most of there time fantasizing about opiates like I do 

I challenge anyone to refute this logic. I don't understand why we let this happen. I know there is a group of over 100k law enforcement officials who are for the legalization they have a group somewhere.

What was your first opiate? And if your opiate of choice is H, what made you switch over?

I guess I will go first...

I started off in my senior year of high school, got my wisdom teeth out and they prescribed me some hydros. Well I didn't even take them till a couple weeks later, took two before school and I was amazed on how amazing I felt, I was so talkative and I was actually paying attention for once. Well that fun only lasted a couple days. Then a month or so goes by and I went to snag one of my dads cigarettes and I noticed a couple pill bottles... so of course I check it out... little did I know my dad who I am really close with was getting loads of hydros and OxyContins (before the tamper seal). So I snagged some every so often when I knew he had extra from previous months.

 At some point he noticed but my dad didn't care and started giving me some. Then his medical condition was getting worse so he would spend time in rehab (physical rehab not drug rehab). Well he would do rehab for a couple weeks at the most and when he was released they would give him all the left over medications to take home! Meanwhile he was still getting his monthly supply from his doctor. So we had plenty of pills. Sadly my dad is now full time at a nursing home, but I love my dad and visit him everyday. Plus I have met some really good connects at the nursing home!

Edit: BTW I do not blame my dad at all for my addiction. It was my choice and even without him I'm sure I would have found them another way.",1518077721.0

Also sorry my writing is garbage, I'm trying to quit dope so I'm using just enough to keep me from getting super sick but I still feel shitty. 

So I hear nothing about Oleg or the money he owes for a few weeks until one day I get a call from his brother, Pavel. Pavel says they (the mafia guys) are at their family home and about to steal it. Now Pavel's english isn't so great, so I'm a bit confused as to how a house gets stolen but he insists on me coming there to help them. Ok, whatever. I drive the 45ish minutes there. Now this is the villiage. We're talking pigs in the street, no indoor plumbing kinda villiage. So I pull up and immediately see 2 older model BMW's . Trademark low level mafia guys cars. I walk around back and there is Pavel and his mom, Iveta, just absolutely beside herself. Losing her shit. Standing around them are the most stereotypical slavic guys I've ever seen. I'm talking Adidas track suit, leather hat, fake gold chain, all while each is holding a bottle of vodka and sipping on it like its a fucking bottle of bud light or something. One of those guys is Taras, a guy who is obviously his boss and some other guy in a suit. Taras looks at me like we're old buddies and says ""eyyyy Cowboy! how you been man!?"" I was like ""uhhh, good until I got a call to come here"". 

So Pavel explains the situation to me. Since Oleg can't pay, and they can't find him, Taras and his ""people"" are going to take the family house instead. The guy in the suit was some bank or city official who the mafia had paid off to help them do these types of things. The house isn't great but I think it's gotta be worth more than $10,000. I tell Taras, ""There has to be something we can do? you can't take their house because of something Oleg did. His family has nothing to do with it"" So Taras takes me aside and starts asking me questions about my time as a soldier. He tells me that ""the men in Kyiv"" are supplying the volunteer battalions with men and equipment. If I agree to spend a year over in Eastern Ukraine, helping to train the guys and show them how to use the equipment, they'll leave my family alone, make me a ""Captain"" and I'll also be paid for my time. Well if you know anything about the war over there, that's a big ol' ""fuck that"" from me. I did my time and barely made it out. No fucking way. So Taras says fine we take the house and your family can sleep in the street. 

At the end of the day, I agreed to pay off Oleg's debt (I have quite a bit of money saved up) and in return, Iveta signed the house over to me. Literally the day after that all happens, Oleg gets home from wherever the fuck he was and acts like everything is great. This was about 3 years ago, and I have since been paid back as well. But not by Iveta, but by Ivetas sister. Why her sister you ask? Well, dumb fuck Oleg borrowed more money and got in with the wrong people, AGAIN. But thats a story for another time. 

I'll try to answer any comments or questions you have in the comments and thanks for reading/being positive about it even though I'm a shitty writer.

I had this one buddy that I would share with every month. Anytime I saw him and rode with him or if he came over I would split and share my lines with him of my personal script. He‚Äôd never had anything just a few Norcos here and there that I didn‚Äôt even bother with bc I get roxies and don‚Äôt like norcos. Anyways I throw him free lines all the time more generous than ever. For some reason this fool gets mad bc he finally found some bars and I paid for the ones he gave me. Gave me a extra 2 that I wasn‚Äôt expecting and left my house without a pill bc his kids were there and didn‚Äôt want to trade in front of his kids, told him to come by the next day and we can trade which I always do. He always bitches and complains that his teeth and face always hurt in which I always gave him pills and free lines but got mad bc I didn‚Äôt give him a pill that 1 time even tho he was gonna have some the next day. Totally blew it out of proportion by getting an attitude and was tripping over a pill. So out of the blue he said fine I‚Äôll just come over and get those 2 bars back and call it a wrap. I said what the hell I said I‚Äôll trade with you tomorrow but he was just trippin so I said Ok after all the pills and free lines that I‚Äôve given you with nothing in return how about you just throw me the 2 bars as a sign of appreciation and thanks since I always throw you so many lines for free, the least you can do is just throw me 2 bars that won‚Äôt even amount to how much I‚Äôve thrown you. Messages me today and said sorry for being disrespectful yada yada yada. I said OK well then next time I get my refill we can probably trade but we just need a break for right now and I said I‚Äôm glad you finally found some legit bars after over two years of not having anything to give me in return for the pills that I gave you. Then he goes into a rant about how i‚Äôm not his friend because I don‚Äôt care that his teeth and face are in pain. Mind you my back is in chronic pain hence having a script. And I‚Äôm like what the hell I‚Äôve given you numerous pills countless of times with nothing in return and now I don‚Äôt care and that im not a friend? Then he has the balls to say oh well you only want something from me because I finally have something meaning the bars. And I said what the hell are you out you‚Äôre mind, I‚Äôve been giving you pills every month almost every week and free lines without anything in return because you never had shit and now you honestly think I only want to trade because you have bars and I get Xanax myself anyways. So am I tripping or is he tripping? Pretty much kind of proved to me that he doesn‚Äôt either remember or appreciate all of the pills that I‚Äôve given him for years without anything in return. I‚Äôve given him pandas, roxies, and even go on runs to get him heroin aka middleman for him and I get nothing out of it. I‚Äôve been nothing but extremely nice and over generous with him and it‚Äôs my script which I can do whatever I want with, sell or trade or whatever but he‚Äôs gotten selfish and acts like it‚Äôs his script or that I owe him something. He benefits the most from my script and has no realization about it. All bc he left that day without a pill in which he was gonna have a few the very next day. Then he said that we can just go our separate ways and call it a loss for the both of us. But in the end it‚Äôs only a loss for him because I‚Äôm the one with all the opiates basically his plug while he‚Äôs the one that has nothing except for the pills that I‚Äôve been giving him for years now as well as one who can get heroin for him.

I just need to vent my frustration.  I'm sitting here with a pain level that is increasing in intensity and the duration is getting longer.  I know there is only so much I can do to make myself comfortable but my ""arsenal"" is do little.  I can't go to the ER because this is a chronic condition and I'd rather not be made to feel like scum for my inability to keep my pain in check.  Funny enough I just saw my PM doc a few weeks ago.  I've had 2 pretty shitty months in a row pain wise.  My doc asked if I wanted to adjust my pain med dose.  I said I'd rather not because I'm not sure if this is weather  related or my spine stuff getting worse/flaring up.  

Now I sit here joints a popin, sharp pain over my incision site and my neck has a quarter size knot.  It's really discouraging...  Ice packs line my back. .. I've taken my gabapentin, a few Advil, 10mgs of hycodan, .5 ativan and here I sit kicking myself for  turning down a dose adjustment.  I used to be on 75mcg fent patches and 10mg of liquid morphine last year.  Then I had a spinal fusion and the 3rd day in the hospital I tore that patch off and never picked up my new script for it. Then a few months later I quit the morphine and got on liquid hydrocone.

So, I live in the dense urban core of large PNW city--it's one of the three highest crime neighborhoods in the city, although of course it doesn't hold a candle to anywhere like Detroit or Chicago. 

My apartment is in kind of an odd setup--there's a normal small 8 unit apartment building at the streetfront and I live on the first floor of a two family house that is built onto the back of that building (or, maybe our house came first? who knows!). The upstairs apartment has access to the larger building, but we don't--we need to go down a walkway next to the front building and then into the backyard to get to our door. 

Our walkway borders the side and back of a large apartment building and its back driveway, which is at the corner of my street and one of our cross streets, and on the edge of our backyard, there's a largeish shed with a tangle of trees and shrubs around it. There's always been a problem with people cutting through our walkway and backyard, as well as the neighboring building's back driveway, to get to the other street, and, in the summer in particular,  hanging out around the shed and the driveway/outdoor stairwells of the large building next door to drink, smoke, camp out even, and, of course, shoot up.

I've never called the cops on anyone, although I will yell at people to leave when they wake me up (my bedroom window is right on the walkway, with five giant recycling bins under it; people sometimes go through them) but my building manager, whose apartment is above mine in the weird tacked on house, gets really het up about this stuff. Today, he saw two guys shooting up behind the shed and called the police.

Unknowingly, on my way home from work, I had arranged for the d boy to swing by, who is super prompt for the first time ever, of-fucking-course. He pulls up as the po-po are fucking arresting one of the poor schmucks from behind the shed (the other guy got away, I guess). We swing around the block  to make the handoff, instead of our usual me jumping in and out of the car, and he brings me back. As I'm strolling back down the walkway to my apt, trying really hard to look like I was just checking the mail, one of the nice officers flags me down. 

He is super concerned for my safety! He'd like to know about what kind of illegal activities have been happening around here and when. He assures me that the bike patrol (which he's part of) will start swinging by regularly, day and night, to make sure those junkies get the message. He is *so goddamn nice* to me.

And the whole time, I have three grams of fire tar in my pocket, which I'm tightly clutching because I'm terrified it will somehow leap out onto the ground. The nice officer wishes me a good day, repeats his assurances of higher police presence *in my fucking backyard* and I head inside. Whereupon, I proceed to get stupid high.

I have never felt my nice middle-class, middle-aged, white lady privilege so strongly before. Fuuuuuuuuuck.

Life is so bland and boring.,"I had a back surgery in June that was supposed to be so simple with a short recovery time.  Well, recovery took about 3 months longer than expected, and it only helped my pain about 50% (was supposed to completely eliminate the pain).  My doctor continued to prescribe Norco for me at my request.  I was taking up to 40mg a day for the back pain, and a yet-undiagnosed condition, possibly fibromyalgia.  I NEVER took it to get high.  I only took the minimum to control the pain.  I started getting worried when I would take 10mg, and that didn't help, then another 10mg about 45 min later, and STILL it wasn't helping.  I knew my body was building up a tolerance and that road wasn't going to end well.  

I SLOWLY tapered and took my last 10mg almost exactly a week ago.  I was able to increase the gabapentin with doctor approval and the transition has been relatively lower pain than expected.  The pain has spiked really bad several times over the last week.  Those times I reached for the Norco, but then looked at it and thought ""you really weren't helping me with my pain, so why would I take you again.""

So now the hydro is out of my body, the pain is for the most part manageable, but and I find life......bland and boring.  I went from peaks of ""I want to talk to everyone and give them a big hug"" about 30-60 minutes after taking a Norco, to now a neutral level, which sucks.   I'm so quiet now people are asking if I am OK (particularly the ones that have never know the non-hydro version of me).

I do NOT feel like throwing myself off a bridge or anything like this.  Just no motivation to do work or even non-work things that interest me.  I have been drinking HUGE amounts of tea (caffeine) with no real effect (compared to how hydro would make me).  Is this normal for life-after-hydro?  How long, if ever, until I feel ""normal"" again?  

I'm not interested in taking kratom, marijuana, or anything else.  Although marijuana may be helpful for the autoimmune condition that is going on, I cannot take marijuana because of my job.  ",1518033078.0
