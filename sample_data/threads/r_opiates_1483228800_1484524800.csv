This sub helped me fend off suicidal loneliness and learn safe using habits. I view it as a lifeline that kept me alive until i was ready to really wrestle the monkey off my back.

If you are struggling and dont want to struggle any more, reach out, get help, go to a meeting, ask questions here for advice. It is entirely possible to go from suicidal hopelessness to sober contentment, in less time than youd think.

Happy New Years and be safe everyone! Use with friends and if you do alone, do so safely. Get clean rigs and narcan. Use the resources on this sub or a needle exchange local to you.

Try not to shoot suboxone or any silly drugs that will barely bring relief IV and could very well make you lose an arm or die. ",1483282703.0

I'd dabbled previously now and again over the years but in the last 12 months things have gotten a little of hand.

As is commonly the case it started out as a weekend thing which has unsurprisingly enough graduated to almost daily use. On averge Il be getting wrecked 5 days out of 7 with a 2 day break of feeling pretty rough in between. Over the last few week's the withdrawal symptoms have been getting significantly worse and I'm really anxious about how itm going to cope.

Normally I just sort of stick it out for the 2 days But obviously that won't be the case this time round. I know this little problem of mine probably pales significantly in comparison to some our you users/ex users out there but any help, support and advice would be greatly appreciated. ..

Just to add Im using about 0.5g a day (IV) and am a male of around 30 years old.

Thanks in advance if you've taken the time to read this poorly composed post.

Update....

Ended up kicking a bit earlier than anticipated. I'm somewhere around day 3 and if there's a hell this must it. I've spent new years at a friends feebly attempting to get drunk to no avail. I came home about 5 hours ago (In western Europe btw) haven't slept at all and my body and particularly mind are completely In the gutter. Complete feelings of destitution and isolation coupled with crippling anxiety and the overwhelming feeling that I've let down everyone thats important to me. Still this is progress though. ...

Today, as my brother was driving me home I saw a women on the ground. I live in the burbs. I told my brother to turn around. I called out to the women and she did not respond. I called to her again and she sat up and opened her eyes. But she was totally out it. She kept nodding and telling me she wanted to go home. I told my brother to call 911. She wouldn't tell her name. But nodded her head when I asked if she used. She wouldn't tell me what. She just wanted to go home. I sat with her and held her hand. I told her I would not leave. When the paramedics and police arrived she whispered to my ""why."" I told her I cared about her and didn't want anything bad to happen. I've been in her shoes. I felt terrible. A single tear dropped down her beautiful face. When the police and paramedics walked over I told them I would not leave her. She kept nodding. And refused to speak to them. She kept her eyes locked on mine. I wanted to cry. It broke my heart. Thankfully, the police and paramedics were kind to her. They got her up but she could not stand or walk. She didn't let go of my hand. She kept her eyes on mine. I told her she would be ok. I said I'm so sorry. The made her let go of my hand when the took her away on the gurney. By this time there were bystanders coming out of their homes. Asking me what was going on. I just wanted to get into my bros car. And as soon as he drove off I broke into sobs.

I apologize for the long post ahead, I could really use feedback so please bear with me. So I frequent r/opiates pretty often and posted a lot on my old account but decided to make this new account for privacy reasons.

But anyway, I do pills everyday. And today I did way more than I usually do. I got a bomb deal on some blues ($25 each) so I bought a bunch and sold some back for $30 (standard price in my area but still good since so many people are upcharging nowadays) to some friends to make some money back. 

So I ended up doing 165 mgs. Which might not be a lot to some but it's an unusually high amount for me to do in 1 day. My friend just reminded me that I need to be careful with drinking tonight since I've done so much. I didn't even think about it and now I'm kinda worried because I don't wanna OD from mixing pills and booze.

So can anyone please give me some advice? Should I be ok if I just stick to beer and maybe do 1 or 2 shots spaced out??

For reference, I do pills everyday, for about 3 years now. I'm 5'10 and slim (145lbs) with a fast metabolism. I usually do at least 60-80 mgs of pills every day with the exception of weekends. Which is usually at least 100-120 mgs. 

I did 105 mgs earlier today  around 1:30 pm and another 60 a few hours ago around 6pm and 6:30, spaced out. 

I won't be drinking for another hour or two, so that's at least 3.5 hours since I've used any. I'm gonna be eating more too in a bit.

Should I be ok with drinking a lot of beer or should I still be very cautious? Sorry again for the long post and my lack of knowledge on the matter. I don't drink very much except on certain occasions so I've never really been in this situation.  

Thanks to anyone who reads this and have a safe New Years!",1483243354.0

After which, idk if I should just keep it all or if I should send whoever the 1500. If the check actually goes through do you guys think I can get in trouble for just keeping all the money? I mean I didn't sign a contract or anything, just spoke to them and then hot the  check. I really hope this isn't a scam because I really need the money.",1483215175.0

Most of you probably don't know me..but I have been lurking for almost two years before I signed up recently..and I really felt a strong connection to a lot of you.

With that being said, I just wanted to wish everyone a safe night.

If you are going to be drinking, please use cabs.  There are actually some companies that do FREE taxi rides home on NYE!  I will try to find a couple links for major cities if I can find some info.

Any of you guys doing opiates tonight...let's all be safe and PLEASE PLEASE do test shots/bumps of any new batches or pills.  Try not to drink too much if you are using (I am guilty of this, I've been drinking for almost 16 years pretty regularly) and make sure you have Narcan on hand if you can.  We lost a lot of amazing people in 2016...I really don't want to lose anyone else..especially any of my opio fam.

With that said...have the best fucking New Years Eve you have ever had...and let's ring in the new year like the fucking awesome people we are.

 Anyway, I got into a argument earlier with my cousion cause he thought I sold his license plate frame for dope money so I leave the house and try to go score to calm down I call up the dboy wait 45 minutes for him to come he hands me my 2 bundles and I ask if it's fent or not and his friend says ""you take whatever we give your n****r ass"" and the dboy laughed and i snapped.... I threw 4 straight punches to his face all of them connecting breaking his glasses and I kept pounding on him and tried to drag him through the open window when his friend ran up with a knife swinging then the dboy got out t-shirt covered with blood (idk from where) and he had a revolver in hand I thought that was the end of me honestly 

Then junkie Jesus saved me, the store clerk comes out and screams he's calling the cops when i look back at him they rush me dropping me and start stomping me out even stomping me in my head before fleeing in their car they yelled out shit like they're going to find me and blow me fucking head off while they were speeding off

I wanted to extend my thanks to this lovely community, I have been lurking for some time now. 

I don't use, but I have watched my friend descend the slippery slope into heroin use. She has always had addiction tendencies and it's only been the past year that heroin has come into her life.
At first I was so hurt and frustrated because I knew this would happen if she tried it and I had tried to stop her. But once I knew that was futile I instead started trying to understand and be patient when she tries to stop then relapses to a worse place she was in before.

Reading the comments and posts from you guys, it gives me strength to remain her friend. She will always know I'm there for her and because of this she is always honest with me. This helps me feel like I'm doing something to keep her a little safer. 

I know you have your own battles to fight, but by communicating you keep people who love you, by your side. Thank you for looking out for each other, too.

I'm 27, my mother has been a homeless drug addict all my life, in and out of jail and institutions. She maintains sobriety for small periods then goes back out. She always kept away from me as a child though. I was raised by my father who developed a nasty addiction to opiates and crack when I was 5/6. This lead to a pretty horrific childhood. I moved out when I was 13. He overdosed and died when I was 18. When he died I thought it was a good thing. Now that I'm older...I regret not speaking to him before he died. 

My stepmother left after my father beat her so bad with a bat when I was 15 that she has brain damage to this day. We have not spoken since I buried my father. She raised and protected me, but the damage he left her with makes it hard to have a relationship.

Fast forward a decade. My mother is still alive and tries to contact me from time to time. She just wants to be in my life. Last time I told her if she really cared about me she'd get a life insurance policy, name me as the beneficiary, and go die. This was extremely harsh, and I feel bad for saying it.

I also feel that she hasn't taken full responsibility for abandoning me with a father she knew had drug problems and was abusive. Both of my grandmother's are well off and while they were always there when I was younger, they ignored my pleas for help and turned a blind eye. 

I find myself with a lot of anger and resentment that has ultimately isolated me from my family. 

How do I reconcile with them and begin to bond again? How do I deal with the anger over everything I never said to my father?

I'm sorry this was such a long post. Where else can I share something like this though? You guys have seen and experienced it all and see life through similar lenses as myself. 

I would also like to add that I am also an addict. Decade long IV opiate abuser, currently 6 weeks clean. I understand the addict mentality, just not how you can continue when a child's life is involved.",1483364825.0

I can always judge my dope on many levels of general quality, convenience, smell, cut left behind in the spoon, rush, high/nod of course, etc.etc... but when the dope is really good, its like I'm trying to give birth to a soda can out my dick... EVERY TIME. To the point where it actually hurts my back sometimes, and i have to grab the wall for extra support, or sit down like a girl which is not only embarrassing to myself but leads to serious noddage which pisses off (no pun intended) whoever i happen to be sharing the bathroom with that that particular night, and leads to numb and improperly contorted limbs. Its like, no matter what in the world of opiates, the better the high, the shittier the side effects. 
 
Since were on the subject, anyone know of any remedies for this shit?

You know, like maybe cool designs (or blank for inconspicuousness), except the decals would probably gangsta shit like guns and money to emulate consistent design themes featured on wax stamp bags. I mean everybody knows fent fucks you up (it's got no legs, but people smoke crack and shoot dillies, right?), so I think a lot of users would *def* be willing to buy em. WYA's and street addicts short on cash or trying not to be high for too long (maybe they've got a big work meeting, seeing family, or have an important court date and need to get high/well, but must also be able to sober up quickly .. who knows) would buy these *all day,* and you might even hook a few Pill Loyalists who trust that it's in pill form and not a powder. Considering how cheap fent is, any entrepreneur (of any race) who knows they won't get in trouble for stepping on someone'a toes / territory could start making fent presses, resulting in a revolution amongst street opiate scenes across America. Junkies getting well off pills that cost $3, then having to hustle up some more money to cop again in two hours? Theoretically that's like $24 a day per customer (give or take, of course, and has 8 hours allotted for sleep and hustle-detours), and this is if they buy one at a time! Tbh, I think a lot of dope users who are sick of risking their lives and being charged heroin prices for fent bags would make the switch too, just so they can at least tell what it is they're using and take precautions accordingly. This product would especially help dealers who don't have a connect (or funds) for serious weight of dope. I mean with how cheap fent is, literally anyone can order a couple grams of fent online and just press their own pills .. if they don't sell 'em on the dark web (which would be super easy, since the vendor could just use a generic pill press and ship them in an OTC medication bottle), I think that all they'd need is a chain of distribution and they'd start making serious coin. Within a few months' time, I'm sure users and dealers would be shipping this product all over the country. Just daydreaming of course, but do you think this sounds like a profitable idea? Do you think advertising the product as fentanyl would save lives, or would the resulting higher availability simply lead to more overdoses?

Smoking and snorting still gives a rush and I know that IV is a better rush, but is that it? Just a bigger rush? Or is it also that an IV shot is always going to be more heroin in terms of volume?

I just watched a doc about an addict .. And he had been shooting for 14 years with no veins left in his body except his Groin, but even after 14 years every time he shot up he would go heavily on the nod -- How is that possible? Is shooting that effective? How the fuck was he able to still nod out after that much of a tolerance?

Last question: every time I watch any detox programme, why is it that methadone addicts have a much tougher time coming off? I know The half life is longer, but if it's so potent and addictive, why is it used to taper off herojn, it seems more logical to go backwards, use heroin to get off Mdone.

TLDR: what's the deal with IV, is it the love of the preparation, and why is methadone ever considered for tapering when it's so fucking potent and addictive?

You may know that doctors often do not carefully evaluate what appears to be an opiate overdose, especially if the victim has already died. [This](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/Library/studies/cu/cu12.htm) archived article describes the findings of a doctor who decided to investigate these cases in more detail. 


What did he find?


**Many ""overdose"" deaths may be actually be caused by pulmonary edema/hemorrhage (destruction/blockage of small blood vessels due to particles being injected)** Don't take this to mean you can't OD the typical way!


He also found that mixing alcohol and other sedatives is a common cause, though I WOULD HOPE EVERYONE KNOWS THIS ALREADY!!! 


When I used heroin, I was nearly always careful to filter the solution precisely, because I feared having particles in my blood would have very bad effects over time (they definitely do). Many other users I knew would put more dope in the spoon than the water could possibly dissolve, creating a dark, solid brown/black mixture. I also noticed they would not carefully find the bevel (pointed opening) of the needle so they could press it into the cotton, which you need to properly filter the solution from particles. 


I found I could never create a mixture half as dark by filtering the drug (the same sample) carefully. A dull yellow transparent solution was the most coloring I got, even with boiling, stirring, etc. This indicates that the dark ""sludge"" others were injecting was a ""colloid"" (liquid with bits of shit in it) not a proper solution (which means the drug molecules have mixed entirely into the water, so that each dope molecule has been separated from the others). They did this because their tolerances had gotten high enough that they couldn't cram any more dope into a milliliter of water and have it dissolve properly (likely the cut contributed to this).


**IF YOU SHOOT DOPE LIKE THIS, YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR HABITS. FILTER IT MORE CAREFULLY, CUT BACK, USE MULTIPLE INJECTIONS BY I.M., WHATEVER IT TAKES!!!**


If you inject but haven't gotten to this point, be sure you don't take it past (to the best of your ability). A few weeks of heavy usage can get you there. If you reach the limit of what the syringe can hold, take that as a sign to cut back. If you need more, a properly filtered I.M. injection or two will do the trick, though it won't kick in as fast (filtering is extra important for I.M., and if certain cuts are present there's a higher risk of abscess, *NEVER I.M. a stimulant*, I've done smack hundreds of times with no abscesses this way).


Overall, PLEASE BE CAREFUL. Heroin is not G-rated, you are not cool because of how much smack you can shoot, you are not taking shots like you do with liquor. THERE'S A REASON DOCTORS SAVE DRUGS SIMILAR TO H. FOR PEOPLE IN UTTER AGONY. Use your brain! Don't become another awful, tragic statistic!",1483427701.0

I am a huge Jazz fan, through and through, but my all time favorite jazz record is the Unknown Session by Duke Ellington:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x00KB_xc8YA

I also love instrumental hip hop as i make these types of beats, the ones that arent really meant for lyrics but rather speak in its own way of music, such as this artist, EWB:

https://hotrecordsociete.bandcamp.com/album/2000s

Also a big fan of the blues. New, old, contempary, dont matter. its hard to go wrong. but one of my favs would be this Blind Willie McTell record, 1927-1933, the early years... He was born blind in one eye and then lost the sight in the other eye due to, as far as i heard from the damn near centennial grapevine, his step-momma tossed some lye in his eye.. this guy was hardcore and made some awesome blues.

New (very bad) experience with dope.,"Hello everyone. I recently acquired a gram of BTH. I've done it before but usually stuck with ECP but I no longer have a plug for it. So I'm relaxing last night and I cook up a shot. I draw it up, finally find a vein and finish the business. Almost immediately after that I started feeling like I was going to die. My heart rate shot up which (I believe) caused my head to start pounding so hard that I went down to the floor (I didn't fall out, I got down there on my own) and tried to calm myself and body down. The headache part was the worst. It felt like every heart beat was associated with every pound in my head and it hurt like fuck. In just a few minutes things started slowly to get better. Eventually I was okay but I have never had this happen. This is the second time I've got tar from this vendor and had no trouble with that. The funny thing is this wasn't the first shot of this tar... I did one yesterday and felt no ill effects. From what I've read online it was probably an allergic reaction?  But why would I get one on the second shot and not first? If you guys can offer any suggestions/help/advice, please reply. I'm not sure about this tar I have now. ",1483412637.0
5lpfta,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5lpfta/kids_when_that_nice_teacher_comes_along_and/,18,https://redd.it/5lpfta,CrystalFieldTheorist,"Kids, when that ""nice"" teacher comes along and offers to let you ""try a couple of experiments,"" just say NO! (They're just trying to get you hooked on science.)","Going into science probably ranks among my worst life choices.  I turned to opiates about a year and a half ago to ""deal"" with my anger, frustration, loneliness, and general dissatisfaction with life as a scientific researcher.  Also, I felt like I had been delaying gratification for my whole life.  I wanted to do the opposite for a change.

Of course, addiction ensued.  But I told myself that I’ll keep doing this until my postdoc ends.  Then, I’ll get out and start life afresh.  For people not involved in science academia, a postdoc is further ""training"" (read: academic serfdom/indentured servitude) for recent Ph.D. graduates who haven’t gotten a permanent job yet.  They can be as short as a year for the lucky few, or not uncommonly, stretch out indefinitely for 10-12 years under several bosses, or even become a sad, low paying, and oft-derided permanent position as a gloried lab technician.

Well, some of you might remember a few weeks back I had my ""fent withdrawal interview.""  I had assumed that that was a lost opportunity and was ready to move on with my life (and onto further interviews).  Yesterday, I got an email from the head of the faculty search committee of that university, asking whether he could call me.  Today, he informed me of the most unlikely decision that I was the department's pick for the tenure-track assistant professorship.

This is a twenty-year dream come true.  I won the academic lottery, only about 1 in 200 students starting out in a science Ph.D. program ever get to run their own lab in the end.  I should be jumping for joy.  Yet, just as opiates take the edge off of harsh, unpleasant aspects of reality, they also seemed to have dulled the euphoria of this moment of glory.  (It could also be because I realized that the other non-academic life problems that caused me to take up opiates in the first place remain largely unresolved.)  

Nevertheless, this sudden promotion from serf to feudal lord is a major life change that will prompt a reevaluation of my relationship to my beloved class of mind-altering substances and this sub.  Y’all are some interesting, witty, and kind-hearted group of people, and despite your status as internet strangers, I feel a deep sense of connection with y’all.  However, it might be my time to detox for good and leave this lifestyle behind.    Tonight, though, I’ll celebrate the only way I know how!

Tl;dr -- despite my best efforts at self-sabotage, I managed to land myself my dream job.  Relationship with opiates in jeopardy though.",1483411820.0

I will throw up to the point of dry heaving, nod off way too hard where I can't even enjoy my high, and basically just time travel because im so fucking high. I hate that shit. Im the type who does heroin for the energy, not to be put in a coma for a few hours where i cant even open my eyes. The stomach issues when I have zero tollerance is the worst part though. 
        Im 3 weeks clean and everytime i think about relapsing i remind myself of this. Not to mention the mental guilt of using when you are so proud of yourself for making it this far. I never want to go back. I use to enjoy being a junkie. I use to love waking up in my car when i was a homeless junkie, driving to the dope spot, and getting my day started. Now the thought of getting high one day and being clean the next is appalling. Its kind of like an all or nothing thing when it comes to heroin. You either live the junkie life or you dont. It simply isnt fun for me to get high just for a day. If im gonna get high im gonna go on a week or month long bender to make it worth my while. The best part of heroin addiction is going from completely shit out of luck sick to well in seconds with the push of the plunger. Going from normal to high simply isnt any fun for me.

after applying a warm compress the lump is gone, and it was a  fairly small amount of dope, maybe 20-30mg total so I'm not super concerned about an abscess. my main question is; how much of a waste was it?

I did half of the bag and waited. It didn't do too much for me, I felt like I needed more. I did the rest about 30 mins later, and within 5-10 minutes I felt sick as fuck. I was standing outside smoking a cig and felt nauseous, dizzy/disoriented, and was sweating profusely. I got inside and thought I was going to throw up, ended up sitting down with a cold towel on my face for about 15-20 minutes until I started feeling better. I also felt a lot less high, though and had a killer headache. I did two bags the rest of the night- first one split into 2 and second one all at once with no incident...

This morning I did half of a bag, didn't feel it enough once again so I did the rest, felt pretty high and felt super sick again. I got to work, sat down and ate a bit and felt a little better. But now, only about 1.5 hours later, I don't feel that high at all and I have a killer headache again. 

The dope itself is definitely whiter than usual. No rocks. Taste is a bit harder to stomach, not sure how to describe it though. Sound like fent?

I understand that it would be way more complex than just that, though.

Xanax keeps me chill and not speedy, adderall prevents me from falling asleep and keeps me focused and good at games, weed makes everything more fun and music sound better while the xanax keeps the shitty weed mental effects at bay. 

But lately I've been thinking maybe throwing some opiates in the mix could be an even better best thing. Taking the opiates earlier in the day so there's more crossover and then when those fade finish it off with xan and weed (don't wanna mix xan with opiates and don't wanna waste the clean opiate high with being stoned). Anyways just wondering if this is a good combo in your experience. I know a lot of you like the sedating effects and don't like uppers in the mix but I'm wondering if the opiates will nicely smooth the edges of the adderall buzz kinda like xanax does while adding in its own high unlike xanax really does.

But it's been 2 years since I created this account after finding out about Reddit while searching my brothers internet history when he was missing. 

My brother, Jesse was 28. He was one of you. He was in this subreddit every single day as far back as his internet history would go. When I posted he was missing many of you helped so much. Even offering to help call hospitals and police stations. I really didn't believe he could be dead. He hadn't lost his job! He hadn't ever stolen from anyone! He looked SO healthy, no one except our immediate family even knew he was using. He often told my mom not to worry about him. That he was a ""smart"" user. He always did a test shot. He always got from the same guy. He thought he was invincible.  I honestly thought he was too. So when he didnt come home one Friday night and my mom was bawling that he was probably laying dead somewhere I sincerely thought she was being ridiculous. But as Saturday passed with no sign of him I also started to worry, hence the username. 

And then Sunday two Newark detectives showed up at our door and told us they found his body. By the looks of it he had been laying there for a few days. When we went to get his things from the police station anything of value had been stolen off of his body and from his car. No one bothered to try to call for help. They just fucking stole his wallet and his dog grooming gear and a jacket. 

My brother was charming and charismatic and loved by so many people. I have 5 kids, 2 that will never remember him and another 3 who beg me for an ""uncle Jesse"" story every damn night. I know by the end my brother thought there was no one left who loved him or gave a shit about him. I'm sure if he could have seen the funeral home he would have been shocked. Your family and friends still love you. Heroin doesn't let everyone hit rock bottom. Jesse's rock bottom was a fucking overdose and unfortunately that's the case for too many people. 

I just feel the need to share this here every year with the hope that it helps someone. Gives one of you the motivation to stay clean one more day. Because honestly I'd do anything for even just one more day with my brother.",1483537439.0

This is probably a dumb question, but my girl and I are trying to kick our dope habit and we're having a rough time of it. We've got some good kratom, according to reddit at least, and it does help. The hot/cold thing is tearing my girl apart though, and most days she'll refuse to go to work without me scoring her a little something. I'm really trying to quit this, I live in a city where cold copping is pretty rough and none of my regular dudes are worth a shit. Also I can't afford our habit anymore.

Anyways, I keep reading about the wonders of gabapentin and lope on this sub for wd aid, but I don't have a clue how to go about finding any. Do I need to go to the doctor and tell them I'm an addict? I'd really rather not, at this point I'm still pretty clean cut and functional. I've read about a few websites that sell it, since technically gaba isn't a controlled substance. I dunno how I feel about that either. 

Advice/thoughts appreciated. Thanks!",1483506589.0

I was a fairly frequent poster before but I had to delete my account for personal reasons.


Anyways, I had an idea that could save IV users some money and I wanted to run it past you guys before I invest time into trying to make it work.

So, needles... they get dull after a couple uses.
What if they could be used like a pencil and sharpened? 

I think I have some ideas to sharpen them but I wanted to know it there is any issue with the idea. The first issue would be sterilization after multiple uses but I would say one could steam/heat sterilize (or get a tattoo artist friend with an autoclave)

Another issue is the particles from sharpening it but a quick rinse with water could remove them.

Who knows. Maybe this is just the crazy talking.

This has been happening on all of my usual good spots. Now I don't think I have blown any veins or worn any out to the point that they are of no use (I feel like I would probably notice if I totally fucked a vein, wouldn't I?) but many of my spots im just getting this little tiny bit of blood, and if I move it around SOMETIMES I'll get a complete register. But most of the time, it's giving me this little bit of blood but definitely not in there. Cuz I have tried pushing a little bit to see if maybe it's just a poor blood flow, but it's definitely a miss. Anybody know? I couldn't seem to find any answers online plus it's pretty hard to explain.

Could it be that I've blown a vein but haven't realized it? I just don't think I did, as there is no difference in the look or feel of the vein.  And this is happening in a LOT of my usual spots  :/

I have 75g of some nice Kratom mix, and like 20 0.1mg Clonodine pills. As well as a bar and a half, if really needed. I've tapered off before with suboxone, usually using 10mg or so, over the course of two weeks. I think I can accomplish the same thing, but maybe even better, with the Kratom and Clonodine. I think I have the Kratom dosing down, but can always adjust. Also, I have lope. But, my question arises from how much of the Clonodine I am supposed to be taking a day. I'm a 150lb male, in pretty good health, all things considered. And I certainly believe myself to have a much higher than average anxiety issue, which leads to some higher blood pressure. Or course, I plan to start with just one pill. But if these Clonodine will help me with the anxiety a bit, and especially the cold sweats, it will be a miracle. I also have some Doxepin for sleep, if needed. 

So yeah, sound like a good plan everyone? Of course, I'll be tapering on the Kratom. But if the 75g doesn't get me quite through, I can pick up some more. I plan on starting with 5-7g doses, maybe twice a day, and going down from there. Like I stated earlier, my main question comes from the dosing for the Clonodine. Anyone with experience with it, please chime in! 

Thank you =)

I fractured my foot 7 weeks ago and my doctor has been prescribing 5mg hydrocodone. I don't take them as directed, and instead of taking one every 6 hours I take 3-4 in the evening. Some nights I don't take any at all, especially if I am planning on drinking. I work it out so the prescription lasts until my next doctor visit. 

TBH, I have a high pain threshold and haven't actually needed these since the first 2-3 weeks of my injury. I really could go without, but my doctor keeps prescribing them since patients with the same injury tend to need them. I have family members with a history of drug abuse, and they ask if I am still getting pain meds, and I tell them no (because I don't want to deal with them asking for any) and they seem surprised when I say that I am not experiencing much pain (which makes me think that it is typical for patients with fractured bones to be prescribed these for a while.)

Anyway, I am becoming concerned about how long I can keep enjoying these pills before I have to worry about becoming dependent on them or possibly having withdrawal symptoms when I quit. Can the small amount of opiates I am taking cause painful withdrawal? I can't find much info through Google and I am assuming since the doc keeps giving them to me that it should be fine until he says no more. 

I don't have a history of serious drug abuse, but I tend to have addictive qualities. I tend to binge on alcohol when I drink and used to be mentally dependent on weed (to the point where I would suffer severe anxiety and depression when I quit) so I am concerned about taking these for too long.

She fell out and the dealer left, the other guy called for help and stayed with her. She died. 

My middle took me to a new dude shortly after and didn't tell me it was him until we were there... I was scared to do his shit but it was fine, and I've met the dude several times since and he doesn't appear to be the piece of shit I imagined. He actually seems to be a pretty cool dude, has thrown me quite a bit extra just for giving him a ride down the road a couple of times, and even offered to help me with a pretty fucked up situation I was in recently and has checked in on me about it randomly via text. 

No point in sharing this really, just a weird experience for me and a reminder that nothing really is ever black or white.

**EDIT- Man, I really came across in a way I didn't mean to at all. I swear I'm not an awful person. I do not think this person is good because of his persona/actions/etc. if he did what he did, he's obviously a shit person and its absolutely unforgivable. The experience simply reminded me that nobody is all good or all bad. When I knew I was about to meet him, I had a view in my head as this obviously horrible person- selfish, mean, so on. That was not the case. It doesn't mean he's not horrible, it doesn't mean I am justifying his rumored actions, AT ALL. It simply is a reminder that even the worst of the worst can have redeeming qualities- which is a good thing to keep in mind really, since that's how many rapists are able to lure trusting young women into hotel rooms in the first place**

**Edit 2- Also, I should make a couple of things clear: I am not completely sure of his involvement. He is known to be friends with the other dude, who was 100% definitely involved, and a dope dealer, and I heard from a couple of people that he was also there. Not enough details to know for sure. He also does not know that I knew the girl who recently passed, he has never discussed it with me and I've never brought it up. 

And I'll repeat: I am not saying anything positive about him! I am simply pointing out that it's not always black and white. The sweet man you talk to at a grocery store who pays for your groceries might have a couple bodies in his basement...

Supervisor said he had a guy who overdosed on opiates, in general someone unconscious, with respiratory depression, and constricted pupils. Staff member at the halfway house said the guy was a FORMER addict that had been on methadone for over 15 years. Supervisor revives him with Narcan, only to have the patient start seizing.


Physician at the ER where my supervisor ended up taking the guy spoke with him a week later, and was really angry. Told my supervisor something like, ""you know that guy you brought in last week? He was seizing for four days. We sedated him but his brain was still having seizure activity. Don't you know about giving Narcan to people on Methadone?""


Anyway, supervisor said that was news to him. It's news to me as well. Our protocols say to give Narcan to anyone with respiratory depression with suspected opiate use. I was under the impression that Narcan puts opiate users into uncomfortable, but not lethal withdrawals.


Anyone here have any insight into this? Thanks. ",1483475508.0

The next time I went to my referring rhuemotologist, they prescribed Percocet for break through pain, only enough for about four days out of the month, while my tnf-inhibitor was wearing off and then kicking in. 

They did this for the next 9 months in which I never asked for a bump in strength or larger amount of pills. Then last time I went they refused to refill my script and I didn't put up a fight but asked for another referral to pain management. 

Now I have a friend that has suboxone pills and in that dose it does help, I'm just wondering if I get a script for those if future doctors will just peg me as an addict. That and is methadone crazy for pain management, I mean if they thought subs were appropriate why not? With methadone I imagine I could take one dose and be fine for four days until the next month when I need break through again.

I'm largely frustrated because I was fine with the percs and just wanted to stay on that or a formulation without the apap.",1483469768.0

Well for me this holiday season was one of the worst I've had in my life, recently divorced moved back to hometown and temporarily living with mom while  working a shitty low paying job 7 days/week bc white collar gigs don't exist in the middle of a cornfield. One upside though I did get my kiddo  over school break all while my job was shut down for 10 days for holiday break so it was seriously some great bonding time w my kiddo. Well while I was mandated overtime my mother graciously volunteers to drive a 10+hr drove each way to get my kid up here. Of course I can't bear the thought of being sick and unable to enjoy my Lil' ones company to the fullest so while mom/grandma is taking a Rd trip down south I am just getting off a 12 hr shift and sifting through the 2g's of fire and $60 worth of hard girl that I picked up that morning. Of course I must give the goods a test drive as any responsible junkie would, a test shot turns into 12 and a long night of speedballs ensue. I should note that I ran into the hard bc a corner boy in the hood just walked up to me while I was waiting on my dope to arrive and told me he had that fire hard. I haven't done any coke in probably 2 years or more so I chalk it up to a Christmas miracle and pounce on this fortuitous opportunity. I am Calmly tweaking with an arm full of dope and vinegar when my only friend within 1000 miles shoots me a text and asks what I'm doing. About a million texts exchange between us with the main topic being how great it is to have a pocket full of heroin and crack and how it's been far too long since I've done a speedball. I go to work the next day looking forward to the Christmas break as I've literally worked a month straight with no day off and I get a text about as long as this unholy book sized post I am writing now. It's from my holier than though, ex police officer of a cousin letting me know that he received a text message from me at 4:30 am the previous night taking about how I wanted to get more cocaine and heroin and how great something called a speedball was he tells me he couldn't sleep after that thinking about how my poor mother was at that moment picking up her grandchild to bring back for Xmas break and he then goes on to name everytime he has thought I was high around him and how I am surely breaking our grandmother's heart with my unruly  behavior. Heart...drops.....breath.....vacates body.....sweat droplet....freezes mid-forehead
So I try to do what any junky with no self respect would do... I lie and tell him I realized how horrible what I did was far before he pointed it out and that I am already signed up for a program starting after the holidays  and that of course I've been sobee since my kid has been visiting(not dope sick but not completely blasted counts as sober right?). Well Xmas day I over did it and was slightly nodding towards the end of dinner as the coke had worn off but the good ole boys were still hanging in there strong. Today I get a talk with my mom about how I sent a text mistakenly to someone and that he shared it with the entire family out of concern after I had ""relapsed"" over Xmas. My only defense and or argument was limited as my text sent confession had painted me into a small uncomfortable corner: ""well mom i certainly did not relapse, you have to be clean more than a day or two for it to count as a relapse""


TLDR: while doing speedballs I sent a family member a text outlining my love for speedballin and my intentions to buy more heroin and crack the next day, after confronting me about it he then shared it with the entire family two weeks later, including my mother and grandmother who used to love me until last month.....",1483605010.0

Said he'd spot me a bundle till pay day (two days away). Forgot both days, Then gave me the bunny for free. Today I came through asking for an 80 and he gave me 2 rabbits and not to worry about it. 

He's the best. Straight business.  But also acts like an awesome older brother.  Feeds me when he's cooking. Smokes me out all the time and tosses me nugs and wax. Gave me a phone when mine broke.  Never makes me wait longer then 15 minutes and am one of very very few who has house privileges. I'll hop on a round of tekken or call of duty with him when I come by. 

I've known him for over 2 years now and has never done me,wrong and trusts me completely.

And has also left his house unlocked and told me to go in and get it myself then lock up behind me.

And o can count one hand how many times I waited more then 45 mins for him to come through or give me the ok to come get it.

I got clean in May after using opiates in general since I was 14. Without telling the whole story again, I relapsed 2 days before my 5 months. After 2 days of heavy oxycodone use, I feared I would return to the needle and spoon. I used my second DOC meth exclusively for 2ish months. Stayed clear of all opiates. After watching a friend from rehab use heroin, I was super triggered. 3 days after watching her, I found myself purchasing a half gram of heroin. 

It has been rough 3/4 months since then, I swore to myself I wouldn't shoot up again. To this day I still haven't, my ROA is snorting. I have always had a insanely high opiate tolerance, after almost 8 months of zero opiates, besides those Oxys, my first half gram in 8 months lasted me a little less the 2 days.

Even though I only snort now, I use a dangerous amount of heroin. I usually see my dope boy everyday. I never buy less then a half gram. I will use a whole half gram is 5 hours. When I buy a full g, I find that I always have at least one line for the morning. Sometimes 3 or 4 lines. I live alone, and besides a single line right after I pick up, I use alone. If something were to happen, I would be fucked

I have .15 left, last dose was at 7pm. I will use this last little bit hopefully 24 hours from now. After that, I am going to bite the bullet and detox once more. Now this isn't shit compared to what I went through getting off the needle. But WD is shitty of course...but the number one thing that bothers me is the constant skin crawling. I can put up with the shits, shakes, sweats, aches, back pain, restless legs and insomnia. But god damn it, fuck skin crawling. This is what always causes me to cop. Besides a hot shower/bath, does anyone have any other tips for skin crawling?

I have been lowering the amount I use, this .15 is my last ticket. I find myself wanting to IV more and more lately. And I know if I do that, I will never be able to leave her. Mrs.heroin, I love you more then I love myself. We spent one day together and you convinced me to take you back. But you are still the same person you were when I left last time. I was foolish to think differently. You have turned me back into the person I worked so hard to change. I cannot let you do this to me anymore. Your lust is breath taking, but your love is poison.

Go to a supermarket, and find no such ear droppers, closest thing was one of those oral syringes (which I had also read about as a good option). I ask the pharmacist, and he says, yes, the ear droppers were sold out, but the oral syringes should work for all similar purposes.

Then he goes behind the counter, pulls out an open one from a supply drawer, and says, ""here just throw this in your pocket, so you don't gotta buy one."" The thing was only like $2.00, but still a nice gesture I thought, until he added, ""...be safe out there.""

* two years clean

* a frequent semi-user of this sub (new account as I forgot my old login data)

* a former balls-to-the-wall degenerate of the speedballingest, crack-smokingest kind this side of the Mississippi

Now the number one aspect will be this: you need a hobby. A hobby can be a mere distraction, or an actual passion. As far as distractions go, that's fine, but won't get you past the pink cloud. It will help until then though, so let's talk distractions.

* I found that books were the best thing to take my mind of craving initially, especially on philosophy, but also low brow stuff like King (yes I said it). Just read like you're in prison or on Sawyer from Lost. It's just so immersive and also a good habit to get into as far as vocabulary and the like go. Now of course other stuff like Netflix etc also works, but books helped me soooo much more.

* Well, now on to hobbies. This is such a vague term, and many people take it to mean, you have to be a social and you have to work out in some way. That's just bullshit. Social and athletic hobbies are obviously important if you're unhappy with either aspect of your life, but take it from an introvert with no athletic ambition - you can stay clean doing whatever.

For example, I personally got way into philosophy, reading and discussing Kant, Wittgenstein, Locke, Hume, Singer, Sartre etc. I just really like the new ""worlds"" and codes that come with each of these thinkers. I really love movies of any kind too, I write up little analyses of stuff I watched and detailed accounts of my impression. What I'm saying - anything can be a hobby, but don't just consume. Make the most of it! And no, just because I'm slightly shy don't mean I don't get any or have no friends - there's a huge market for artsy, introvert folks like me.

* All that said, comfort meds still help! I wouldn't be clean without my rapid sub taper (like 5 days) and my week-long Ativan regimen. I just can't CT without giving in. But don't switch dependencies either!

* So, here's the final point which was such an important gateway for me. Stop shooting Coke first, then stop dope. I'll maintain that Coke is the actual devil's drug, NOT Heroin. Coke gives you the nastiest abscesses. Coke eats up money like mad. Coke leaves you fiending the hardest. Coke's rush is not worth the comedown, cost or long term ill effects (think off your veins!) So in my book, as long as you lay off that Gaga, that Norway (white girl, Jeezy reference for you uncultured people) you're doing great.

Keep in mind, I don't wanna patronize nor preach. There's not a single way to get clean. Sobriety does come with a lot of preconceived notions though, and it's ok to not adhere to what society deems necessary in order to stay addiction-free long term.

Thanks for reading, and do you!!!

What I mean is, I'll buy Xanax, coke or weed off one of my dealers consistently for a while and then when I hit him up for something like percs or oxy he doesn't reply right away, if at all. The responses usually are negative or something like ""I don't fux wit opiates bro bro,"" or ""I don't want you to hurt yourself bro bro."" Which is odd because, I've definitely personally done way more physical damage to myself barred out than nodding on a few Oxys. 

I've never done heroin and I'm not addicted to opiates (yet hopefully lol) but I've done my fair share of oxy in the past while keeping it manageable without cravings (even after back to back days of use.) I've been fortunate enough to have my dealers usually be my friends so they claim they don't want to hook me up ""because they care about me,"" which makes sense but I don't feel like I have a problem. 

I know that's been said by everyone with a heroin addiction at some point but I'm really more of a Polydrug addict, I still get the most thrills from coke and drinking over oxy.  Maybe it's the area I'm in, but that seems to be the vibe I get from most dealers other than the golden boys who hook me up for a short period before going dark on me. Should I meet more serious dealers like I have in the past, confront my few close dealer friends (somehow without looking like a fiend) or just turn to the Dark Net? 

Whatever advice you guys can give would be helpful and stories relating to this topic are appreciated. Its my first time posting here but I lurk a lot and love the stories I find.

The cat had punctures/tears in it's belly and hips, exposed muscle, the works. Of course I helped her but I forgot about my own bills and now I'm up against the power getting shut off the day after tomorrow.

Ya know, I'm just disheartened. I really made a concerted effort to do it right but you can't account for everything. I can tell myself that it isn't entirely due to my shitty addiction being that I actually had the money to give my sister - money I would have used on the bill, but the reality is that if I wasn't using it wouldn't even been an issue to begin with.

I feel like fucking garbage. My stomach is nauseous and I'm outta weed. Been popping klonopins and they might as well be skittles, ate a whole $60 syringe of CBD oil in two days and it feels like it helps but it's way too expensive. Which is funny cuz I had no problem spending $80 a day on dope. 

The reason I quit right away with no notice is my dealer forgot to take my money so rather than go back and pay it back plus more for a new pickup I saved the $80 and decided to quit.

Surprisingly I went to the gym last night and had a decent workout, which blew my mind.

The only thing thats giving me comfort is thinking about coffee, weed, cigarettes. I hate how it takes weeks of feeling shitty after using for a few months to get some normalacy.

I'm asking for help. 
I'm trying to kick an addiction from codeine. The most I take is 300mg a day, and in a week I skip 1 to 3 days.

With some OTC stuff wich contain 120mg codethyline 120mg codeine, I am able to stay without any problem at 240mg codeine/codethyline. (I hope codethyline is as strong as codeine and not stronger :/ ) -edit : undestand 120mg codethyline + 120mg codeine, not 240 of each-

Can someone describe me a good taper plan ? I'm able to stay ~35h without the product with not going that much sick, so take into account I can skip days but for skipping 1 day I need 2 consecutive days of dosing (and I prefer keeping my schedule of skipping some days because I don't want withdrawaling from 8 consecutive weeks of intake).
Generally there is exactly 24h beetween dose with minimal disconfort at the end.

help

this drug is fucking my life I know I'm not into hardcore addiction but that's really annoying

Ive no idea how hard it will be. Last time I tried, I kicked after 1 complete week of intake (7 consecutive days - but my ""normal"" schedule before), and I finally rellapsed at the 14th day (FUCK). WD wasn't that hard but I was lethargic day 2->6 (but felt minor WD to day 14)


For example, is this schedule maintainable : 

day 0 (tomorrow) : skip
+1 : 180mg
+2 : 180mg
+3: skip
+4 : 180mg
+5 : 120mg
+6 : 120mg
+7 : skip
+8 : 120mg
+9 : 120mg
+10 : skip
+11 : 120mg
+12 : 80mg
+13 : 80mg
+14 : skip
+15 : 80mg
+16 : 60mg


Ive no idea the dose from wich I can jump ???? It would be good advice if some know

It's now 1,5 year I'm kicking various opiates and this begin to really depress me I hope it's the last step (before it was heroin then sub)

EDIT : I CAN GET MY HAND ON SUB but this would be the last option if possible, sub is hardcore.

Not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm in need of some help...I bought a 5g bag of Fu Fen in early November and have been dosing daily since, mainly via small key bumps (which I know is a horrible idea).  For those that are unaware, Fu Fen is a research chem fentanyl analogue (albeit much less potent than the real deal).  I've used codeine/vicodin pills regularly before and never felt addicted to them so I think that made me overconfident about this. In retrospect that was very, very stupid.

Anyway, this Fu Fen is a whole 'nother beast. I'm to the point where I need to dose about every 1-2 hours otherwise I develop bad withdrawal symptoms. The worst symptom I notice which is intense back ache which makes it impossible to even lie down comfortably. Insomnia is the worst too - I can't sleep more than 2-3 hrs without waking up and needing to redose. I think the insomnia is really what got me hooked originally as I'd wake up with terrible back pain and be unable to sleep.

I'm just tired of being reliant on this stuff and was wondering if there is any advice or firsthand experience on battling through this. Is it better to wean off or go cold turkey? I was thinking about at the very least I should put the rest of the bag into a PG solution so that I can titrate down my doses more properly, and hopefully wean down that way. I also have an old bottle of Tramadol and was thinking I could try to use that to wean down as well. On the other hand my buddy thinks I should just flush the rest of my bag down the toilet and try to power through the withdrawal cold turkey.

What do you guys think I should do here? Am I just being a bitch and need to power through this? Bottom line is I want to be off this stuff and will probably not touch opiates anymore. I just want to know the best way to do so. Any advice would be appreciated.",1483558034.0

So my question is, how many Dialuds 2mg should I take in order to receive pain relief that equals a 10mg Percocet? 
And yes, I do know about the sidebar but I was hoping to see some tips or potentiators that are successful.

Due to govt crackdown and economics and whatnot I've used H (snort) from many different sources. 

The effect is usually this: I get high for maybe 20 minutes (I know the dope may be cut with fent but this is with every source I've tried)...then I get really weird. I tend to have...I guess you could call them delusions. Like I start thinking I am supposed to go to an appointment to get dance lessons or something. All really weird dream-like stuff, but I am awake and interacting with people.

 I also lose awareness of how messed up I appear and am genuinely shocked and angry when people accuse me of acting weird. 

Third I get really crazy energy like, just lie in bed punching at the ceiling and shouting all these weird phrases. 

Guys I know I'm a strange person but does anybody else get any of this?

I have gotten this a bit from other opiates but never quite like this. I remember clearly thinking last time ""I don't like this stuff.""

And again, this wasn't from some weird cut. It happens with multiple sources from different parts of the country. ECP, BTH, everything.

Edit: just remembered (oh the irony) something else...I lose short term memory. It's like being on weed. I can't remember where I hid my dope, how that food got left out etc.

I have been trying so hard to stay clean! My dad has been flushing the patches when he changes my mom's patch. Also continuing to take naltrexone and go to NA meetings, therapy, take meds for bipolar and ADHD.

My little brother got out of rebab right after Thanksgiving and is doing pretty well aswell. Relearning how to be a dad to his 16 month old son. My mom and I have basically been taking care of him while his mom works long hours and my brother was in jail and rehab.

Started going back to meetings and working step one. Yesterday I got a huge reality check from my therapist. I was harboring all this guilt from stealing patches from and off my mom and all the lying and treating my amazing husband like crap. He brought me down to earth and reminded me I am not God, nor am I the most important thing in the world. Being raised by a narcissistic father has skewed my perspective of life.

Just remember, when you are ready to get clean, you can! You are worth it!!!

TL;DR 107 days clean! No matter what you have done, you are not the most Important thing in the world! NA helps. Naltrexone will block you from opioids and make you dope sick if you use. You are worth it! If you want to talk, feel free to message me.",1483547404.0

So I recently posted a pic of the identification kit I used to test some dope I got.

Some users here expressed to me that the results pictured seem to indicate a product with little to no H. However, being so extremely potent and powerful (and some other things), I've come to the conclusion it must be mostly fent if not ALL plus some cut.

I sourced another seller and using the exact same test, I saw how quickly and VERY NOTABLY the liquid inside the patch turned an extremely dark green that looked nothing like my usual product.  The product is undoubtedly not as strong and had some other garbage cut in it that produced a histamine reaction on my skin (or was just absolutely disgusting smoked).

So anyway,

TL;DR - I've been a little hesitant to do any more than a small shot of the ""fent batch"" because it usually puts me on my ass just smoking off of foil, even.  I've done a few slightly-larger-than-a-test, maybe a shot the size of what I'd dump on the foil for a couple of hits (which actually even get me high, especially first thing in the am).

The question: with a definite fent on my hands--should the smoking rush be comparable/close to IV? In my experience thus far, it seems pretty damn close. I think the addict in me just decides to IV because we all know how much is wasted off the foil, no matter how good you are at it.

Nonetheless: with fentanyl--should the rush/feeling from shooting & smoking be much different? Or is the fent so potent either way that it is very close?

P.S.

On that note...even though I've already experienced how shitty trying to come off this is...got me a half G late night, so it's going to be a lovely Friday! TGIF! :) ",1483708096.0

 Now is the time to ask yourself, are opiates making me happy at all?

Or are they just increasing my stress and self-loathing?  Is the very feeling which had drawn me to opiates even there?  Or do I experience only a few moments of wishful thinking, wishing for a ghost of a feeling that has long passed?

Not downing Suboxone as a bad drug, it saves many lives, just surprised how a lot of people are reacting saying to take 0.5mg and how banged up that'll get me (and most people)... how powerful it is, etc... how is it powerful if it's not doing anything for me really? And yes I hold it under my tongue for 5 minutes before swallowing.

Another thing, I'm not even getting any relief of the pain that I have in my neck.. so I'm not finding it effective for me at all (recreational or medicinally).. or it could be the dosage that I'm taking.. but this med is *super duper potent* according to many seasoned users...",1483681674.0

the first one is about my ex, who got me into heroin 2 years ago. she was my first girlfriend ever, she took my virginity, i loved her to death.. and out of nowhere, she kept badgering me about buying heroin for her, and obviously.. it was my choice to buy it, and to do it with her.. but she was very manipulative, and had me keep buying it, and i was so in love with her that i just wanted to do anything at all to please her, and make her happy. then.. she went to rehab, i slowly became addicted and whilst she was gone, i got clean too, on my own at home. it sucked.. bad. but, she came back! and... she instantly blocked me on facebook, got a new phone, cut me out of her life completely. i was heart-fucking-broken, man. i wrote that song after cutting myself all over, going through withdrawal, and crying my pussy ass eyes out over her. she doesn't give a fuck.. and she never will. she got what she wanted out of me, left, and that was that. there's a lot more she did to me that fucked me up mentally, but that's another story for another time.

the second song is just a song a good friend of mine and i, and fellow heroin addict slug christ made that just... well, talks about dope and depression. two big parts of my life. two shitty parts of my life. i have a few more songs that just have a few bars talking about herron and my addiction to it and whatnot, if y'all are interested and wanna hear, lmk!

Speaking of meds, I'm going for heroin detox. I'm not a fan of Suboxone, but that's most likely what they'll give me. Should I ask for a methadone treatment or just shut up and take the subs?

Is it co-ed? Do people hook up in detox/rehab? And what are the odds that some patients will be abusing drugs in there secretly?

Well here the past few times, he's sold me something that is not heroin and I found out what it is through that same friend that my D-Boy's partner quit because he started getting ""out of control"" and he told my friend everything.

He's taking this RC opiate, U-47700(?), and cutting it 25/75 or something like that, with Dormin and throwing in some powder dye to make it look tanish. He's smart but he's also a dumbass at the same time because after doing some research on this chemical, it's MUCH stronger than heroin and I wouldn't be surprised if someone hits a hotspot one day and dies.

I know it's this chemical because it tears my nose up and I've noticed myself getting more and more addicted lately. Like my tolerance is building QUICK. Also his H used to come in more of a ""rock"" form and now his ""new"" stuff comes in all powder.

If you are employed and have direct deposit...I suggest getting a GreenDot card online.  The card is free initially, and only has a $9.95 monthly fee...and if you get at least $1000 deposited in a month...the fee gets waived even.  

The card itself is a prepaid Visa card...but it actually has a bank that has a routing and account number, so you can set up direct deposit with it.  You can even order paper checks just like a normal bank account as well.  The real magic of this card though, is the fact that you get your direct deposit 2 days before your payday.  From my understanding....as soon as your employer sends then the direct deposit info (date of payday, amount of money, etc), they post the money to your card immediately, instead of waiting until the money clears like the majority of other banks.  My payday is Friday, and while most people at my job get their check deposited at like 2am Friday morning...mine is available on Wednesday at around 4:45pm, because that is when our payroll department submits all the info to our banks before they go home at 5pm.

Not only that, but GreenDot also just rolled out a Secured credit card.  I have horrible credit...and this is a good chance for me to start the long and tedious process of fixing up my credit.  The interest rate is horrible...but the idea is to just pay off your balance each month to avoid the interest.

I am sure most of us have heard of/used Greendot cards before...but I wasn't aware of the fact that you could order a card and get one shipped to you with your name on it, and that it is just like a checking account.  I certainly wasn't aware you could DD your paycheck onto one and get it 2 days early on top of that!

Most of my friends don't do anything harder than weed (or maybe molly), so I wanted to be discreet about using Coke at my friend's New Years' party. I do coke maybe 5-10 times per year, and while it wouldn't be a big deal being open about it, it's not something's I want tied to my image. To save time, I put my coke in empty stamp bags (about .15 each .. out of the teenth that I copped, about 10 Coke stamps made it to the party). If I wanted to dose, I'd just go to the bathroom, dump a stamp on my phone, and it'd be lined up and snorted within about a minute in a half.

I'm prob stating the obvious, but be aware that you need to weigh each empty stamp bag seperately, as they all have different weights. Any clean spoon (the smaller, the better) should be ideal for sifting your yayo into the bags.",1483733608.0

I want to write a message publicly to V (heroinonaplane), opposed to privately because I know he has friends on here that care about him and may want to comment on this. V, you are my best friend in the entire world. The first time I ever met you we clicked and have had an amazing friendship ever since. You have always been there for me when I needed you, whether it was just to talk, or let me stay at your place when I had nowhere else to go. I have become so accustomed to talking to you everyday and falling asleep to the sound of your voice. The other day when I didn't know if you had been accepted into rehab or if something had happened to you, I was so worried that I couldn't sleep. I haven't felt the need to read your posts in order to know what's been going on with you. I know we tell each other everything and I know that you are in a very difficult place in your life right now. I want more than anything for you to get the help that you need and get clean. I have no doubt that if you don't get clean soon, that I will lose you. You are one of the most kind-hearted and intelligent people that I have ever met. There are so many people in your life that love you and care about you, and know how amazing you are. I know we have this discussion everyday, but I am begging you to get clean and get your life back on track. As you know, I am not, and would never judge you, as I have been in the same place as you many times. I am truly afraid of losing you and I can't stand the thought of not having you in my life. You have your whole life ahead of you and so much potential. I know you want to be clean and be the real you that I know and love. The point of this is not only to tell you how much I love you and care about you, but also so that other people who care about you can chime in. I hope that you will realize how important it is for you to get the help you need as soon as possible. I know you are ready. I love you more than you will ever know. We have so many sober people things planned, and I want to make sure we do them (thrift stores, bagels, roadtrips, etc, etc, etc, you already know).... I hope maybe this will help you see how important you are not only to me, but to others as well. Your best friend, J (nena)",1483888451.0

38-year-old man lost a testicle during an argument with his girlfriend Thursday, leading to her arrest on battery charges.

Tara Danielle Pegues, 36, was charged with Level 6 felony domestic battery, Level 3 felony aggravated battery and misdemeanor resisting law enforcement after the incident that took place in her home in the 600 block of Spring Street.

Police were called to the residence at approximately 3:55 p.m. Thursday, according to reports from the Police Department.

The initial call was made by a third party who was concerned after Pegues and the victim were heard arguing.

Upon arrival police could hear the couple shouting, but they said ""everything was fine,"" according to the reports. Both Pegues and the victim repeatedly told police the argument was only verbal and never turned physical.

But, as the victim was speaking with police, he ""reached down and picked something up that had rolled onto the ground,"" according to reports. Police said his posture changed immediately and he told police ""his (scrotum) was cut"" and that ""his testicle had just fallen out onto the ground.""

He was transported to hospital for treatment and told police a more detailed story. 

According to reports, Pegues and the victim were arguing over his possible infidelity when she became abusive.

Officers observed a fresh laceration to the right side of the victim's neck and right cheek, but the victim was unable to describe how those injuries occurred.

In the victim's words, according to the police report, ""she 'snapped' on him and he attempted to leave but she refused to allow him to leave ... When he got to the front door, she grabbed his testicles, causing one of his testicles to become detached from his body.""

After obtaining a warrant based on the victim's statement, police returned to arrest Pegues.

Police were unable to find a bloody knife in the home, but said in reports that the victim did not say he was cut by Pegues.

The warrant also included a search for narcotics due to the strong smell of marijuana coming from the residence, but only a small amount of marijuana was found.",1483883005.0

Lately he's been shooting about 25 bags (we're right by Paterson) per day.  He wanted to quit and didn't have a comfortable place to be sick so I let him stay in my room.  Last shot was at 10pm yesterday.  We went to sleep fine.  Today, he was laying in bed all day and was being an asshole so I tried to leave him alone.  Then I tried sleeping next to him and he kept shuffling and making grunting noises so I woke up and came in the living room.  Now it's 5am, I'm chilling on reddit and I hear him throwing up in the room. All he had was chips and snapple around 2pm.  I went in to see if he's okay (and to check he didn't throw up on my bed - he didn't) and he said no and basically told me to fuck off lol.  So I'm just here, back on the couch again but I feel like there must be something I can do to help.  

Do you know anything that can help?  If you've gone through withdrawals yourself, what's something you would have appreciated during the sickness?  Should I try to make him drink water or should I just leave him alone? I'm concerned about dehydration.  

I think he took cough medication so he's not really coughing up a lot.  He said he forgot imodium but I haven't seen him shit yet.  

I would like any advice you can give.  Thank you for your time.  

edit: I went to sleep and planned to get him some imodium and weed when I wake up.  Unfortunately, I woke up at 1 to him leaving the house with all his shit.  I tried to change his mind, tried to remind him of the job he was going to get once he was clean but he had already made his decision.  Thank you for all your help.  If he tries quitting again I will relay the info beforehand and follow the wd guide on the side.  He always acts like he knows what he's doing but he clearly doesnt.. how can he forget imodium and reject my ibuprofen and say he tried???

edit: I also hope you guys know that there's someone that really cares about you.. you're never alone and I hope you guys can stay clean/be successful with your own detox.. happy new year

The idea is like a house arrest ankle bracelet or other electronic monitoring device, but with biometric sensors on some part of the body (wrist, chest, ankle, etc.).

Some drug addicts get arrested, go to jail, detox for a few days, and then leave jail. A lot of them relapse shortly after getting out of jail, then they fail a urine test that is part of their probation and they end up going back to jail. Or they overdose.

Our idea is to give people a wearable device that measures heart rate, GPS, skin temperature and other variables after they get out of jail. If a lot of people who are wearing these devices relapse after leaving jail, we can mine the data from their wearable devices during the time period shortly before the relapse (and maybe also their smartphone usage or other variables) to look for patterns in the data that would suggest that a relapse is likely to happen.  Then, if people meet the criteria for a probable relapse at some moment in time, based on the combination of biometic data from their wearable device and other data about them, we can implement some kind of intervention, like a phonecall or a visit from a social worker, to try to prevent the relapse.

I'm looking for feedback on this idea from people who have experience with substance abuse and addiction treatment. Thanks!",1483856552.0

I legitimately have no idea what to do or where to start.
I would like to know what size needle I should obtain.
How to mix it / what to mix it in / how to filter.
How much I should use on the first shot.

My goal is to be safe, though I understand inherently that what I am going to do is not safe at all.

I would prefer to not look on youtube blindly, or anywhere else for this information. I would really appreciate everything you all could do to help me in terms of explanation. If you have a GOOD video that you would recommend I will watch that, but as i know nothing about what I will be doing I don't want to watch a bunch of videos and be oblivious to correct / incorrect techniques and fail horribly.

I just want to survive this one time. I have self control and I will only do this once (IVing) and move on with my life (yes, that's what they all say).

I love you.
Kisses.

BF was desparate, as we'd just gotten in a car accident the night before and spent the night dope sick. He took the whole shot when normally he'd do a tester if it's from somewhere new. He knew right away. ""Baby, it's too strong,"" he whispered, and I saw the panic set in before I watched him leave his body. His eyes pointed in different directions. I tried to alert him, wake him, and his friend we'd been staying with heard the commotion and came out of her room into the living room. ""Call 911,"" she instructed me. I panicked. His lips were blue. He was gone. He'd stopped breathing. The 911 dispatcher on speakerphone instructed her to start CPR and I went downstairs to let the paramedics in. I didnt want to leave his side in case he died while I was gone. I screamed at them to hurry, but everyone moved as if they were underwater. Slowly, they made their way up the stairs as I screamed at them to please help him. ""Don't let him die."" The moment he woke up was the happiest moment of my life.

About a week ago I tried to IV some H into my hand vein - I probably missed the vein, or I pushed plunger down too fast too. Either way, it left a wide but somewhat flat bump.
It disappeared over a couple hours and I felt fine. My hand looks fine but for the past couple of days it has felt a bit weird like a bit of heat (without touching hand) and very minor aches. But my hand isn't in any real pain and has 100% strength and functionality.

Overall, I feel slightly off, say 95% healthy, but i don't know if that 5% is just in my head. 

Is there something happening internally that I should see Dr? Should I just ride it out? Or is it just in my head? ",1483850330.0

After an unnecessarily long wait, I get X-ray'd, turns out I also have pneumonia and a minor fracture to one of my ribs. 

Well shit boys, looks like I'll be getting some goodies in my to go bag, right? ~~No~~ Well unless you can get a nod off z pak and albuterol 

Miss ""I'm sure a fractured rib can't hurt that bad"" Nurse practitioner tells me to take Advil and Tylenol to make it feel better. *Well golly gee why didn't I think of that? Oh wait I did, and have been maxed out on ibuprofen for the last 48 hours*

I ask for stronger pain killers and am offered prednisone, well lady last time I checked, prednisone is not a pain killer (per se), and is definitely not of the opioid variety which is what I'm here to get

Then we get to the excuses:

 * Only an MD can write narcotic prescriptions. *false*

 * A broken rib doesn't warrant a opiate prescription *false*

 * We've had a problem with people selling or abusing their narcotic scripts and so we don't really give them out to ""people your age"" *Bing bing bing we have a winner, finally a grain of truth*

However Miss Nurse Practitioner forgot that **my mother was standing next to me** when she accused me of being the kind of person who  abuses drugs. Mamma bear was none too pleased that someone would accuse her little angel of abusing drugs, while he is sick no less.

The whole thing ends without incident, and we leave with scripts for my consolation prizes. Mom goes into the pharmacy to fill my scripts while I call my bud and ask if he has any pills I could get. he has some Vicodin that he is willing to give me, not sell, give. So my mom and I go by his house under the pretense that his mom had made me soup, plausible enough, I go in get my soup and other goodies and leave. So mom and I get home and mom wants to warm me up some of the soup, proceeds to find my Vicodin as well.

In true motherly fashion, she is rationing my pills, but I can have as much soup as I want.

1.) is addiction very sudden? or does it creep up on you with heroin? (what i mean by this is it one of those drugs where you feel like you want it again immediately after your first high or do you feel like you can control it for a while but end up getting addicted slowly?) 

2.) would it be possible for someone with no tolerance to use it without overdosing? or would they need some sort of tolerance to opiates before trying it

3.) for long term users do you guys still feel the high? obviously the high feels less intense as time using increases but i've heard a lot of long term users using it to feel normal and not dope sick but not really for the high

4.) is the high great? i hear a lot of the negative things about the substance and what it can do to people but i never hear about if the high is enjoyable so what's it like ?(experience stories are welcome (: ) 

5.) is it a rare drug? i've only tried to look for it a few times and everytime i haven't been able to find anything is it just something that's really uncommon on the streets or is it more secretive since it is a harder substance or something like that?

Or are you the responsible type that always waits to get home first? I am not.

Once my gf had to go to Grady memorial hospital. She had got mildly hit by a car (no severe damage just bad bruises, it could've been fatal if I hadn't snatched her mostly out of the way). We were also sick and were just about to go see our guy when some fucker ran off the road and hit us after we had just parked. She was insistent I get us our dope even though we were at the hospital and I was happy to comply. There was a cop with a guy who had caused a bad accident while fucked up right outside the room though and we couldn't close the door, only pull a flimsy curtain to block most of the view. It was part of the er and not a real room like when you get admitted. I got my guy to bring our shit to the hospital which was super cool of him and he even threw me an extra .5 to test for him which was even cooler. The inside of his car reeked of bud like it was made out of the stuff. I put on my poker face and went back inside the hospital and walked right past the cops (2 now, sitting right outside the room) and proceeded to make and do a shot. We only had 1 rig between us and before I could give her hers a nurse popped in and almost caught me making her shot. I now noticed there were 3 damn cops outside the room. As soon as the nurse left she did her shot. Almost the exact second she finished a Dr and another nurse came in and wanted to see her. All of the cops were staring at me when that curtain was pulled back. Only after the shots were done did my gf tell me I smelled like I had a few lbs of kush on me. I was being such a dumb fiend and looking back I was extremely lucky.

One time my gf and I did a shot right out front in the open at a strip mall. We've also done the extremely stupid act of doing shots while driving. One time we were super sick and had just picked up in a McDonald's parking lot so of course we immediately make and do our shots there which is not at all unusual. She was done before me like always but right as I get a flash of blood she freaks saying there is a cop walking up to the car and to hide it. Instead I finish my shot deciding I'm not going to jail sick. I figured it would only be me going down anyway since any time we've been in a situation like that I say everything is mine. Turned out it was just a security guard getting lunch and he walked right past us though.

Oh and also the back of a taxi and plenty of other random sketchy places I should've had the self control to have resisted sticking a needle in my arm.

I think this a cool topic. I will start. This story is semi long, but I promise it is worth the read.

Some of you may remember that I used to work for a chill ass dude. I would travel with a carnival, and also set up and tear down concert stages. I loved this job, $11 an hour, plus a free show. I am a fan of pretty much every genre of music. Besides religious music the only other genres I don't enjoy are modern pop, modern rap and country in general. I am a huge fan of rock, especially classical, when I herd our next stage gig was the rolling stones, to say I was excited is a understatement. 

The day after step up, we came back to enjoy the show and tear down afterwards. About 30 minutes into the show, my boss, his wife, my very good friend Cody (rest in piece brother) and I decided to do a shot. Since it was fucking packed and the cars were four blocks away, we crawled under the stage. We didn't want to miss any of the show walking to our cars. After we all got done preparing our shots, they were performing paint it black. Like many, this song is one of my favorites from this band. I did a  huge ass shot of I'd stay the third best dope I have ever had, under the stage of a The Rolling stone's concert, while they were performing plaint it black. 

That is one of the best memories I have using heroin, well actually any drug in general.  I have a decent amount of stories/memories  about heroin, well drugs in general, I accumulated while working for this guy. I have more entertaining/ interesting stories about stage gigs then I do carnival ones. Which is expected. If enough people request more stories, I will edit the post or comment another story.

I can't wait to read all the other stories you guys share. This topic interested me greatly for some reason. Hope you are all well today, I was sick all yesterday and  today, then randomly made a $200 come up.

We don't really care, because we're dope sick. But we don't eat much on dope, either, so the hunger is starting to gnaw.

The sun is nearly up in the sky. I've been up about two days, anxious, gagging, shivering. Jess has been asleep most of the time. I envy those who can sleep through the sickness.

I'm starving. I don't want to eat though, the thought simultaneously entices and disgusts me. Subway and Wendy's commercials tease me on every commercial break. I wish we had a few bucks, to run into town and split a $5 foot long, or grab a few 99 cent nuggets.

I call my mom again. Its almost noon, and she answers.

""Mom.. I dont know how to tell you this.. But Jess needs an abortion. We cant keep it. You know I dont want kids..""

I feel slimy.

""Yeah we are just $300 short. Yeah, well, we are trying to schedule it for this week. We have to drive to the cities to do it. Really?! Thanks mom! Oh - no  - can you send it today? ... So we can drive down tonight and take care of it in the morning. No - we don't need a hotel, we can stay with Jim and Mary. Yeah, thanka. About three hours then? Thanks so much!""

I know she didn't believe a word of it. Anyone could hear the dope sick desperation in my voice, my own mother probably knew I'd call her today before I did. But it worked. 

""Baby wake up, we gotta go see B.""

Jess sits up abruptly, and a smile grows on her face.

""How much?""

""Just $300, and it won't be till around 3. We can panhandle for gas on the way though.""

She's up and dressed with her jeep warming up before I can even get my shoes on. We feed the cats, grab our stuff and we are on our way.

As we pull into the first decent sized town we pick our usual Walmart to spange at. She looks cute, innocent and trustworthy. I look desperate and shady. The kinda guy you'd pay to leave a nice town like this. And they do.

15 mins later we meet up. I have $7, and she has $25. These little towns are so generous. At the gas station she pulls her act on a teenage kid going out with his snowmobile. He uses his card to put $10 in the tank, so we grab a pack of real smokes and top it off. Rollies taste terrible when I'm dope sick.

Two more hours on the road (and a few bathroom stops for me) and I get the call. The money is waiting for us.

We pull into the first suburb and get the money. Another hour and change in traffic, and our miserable, anxious souls are finally waiting on B.

Dope in hand, we get well and start our happy drive home. We will be well for a few days at least.

We saved $30 for food and essentials. But as we near the same gas station we spent our panhandled money, we are starving. Ravenous. Few things compare to the hunger an addict feels after a shot preceeded by days of dopesick anorexia.

""Baby can we get a heggies pizza?"" I ask.

""Hon those are like $12. Fuck.. They are good though. And I'm starving too..""

""Let's juat do it. We can sell drizzle a few points and buy groceries tomorrow.""

""OK fuck it.""

Our delicious pizza in hand we start the drive home. I get ahold of Drizzle, and he meets us at home.

I take our pizza out of the oven as we sit around the kitchen table, getting high, shooting the shit. Jess runs off to toss her cookies in the bathroom, as I nod out at the kitchen table. Drizzle only has $20 on him, but we hook him up anyway, with a promise for him to send the rest in the next few days.

I wake up, still at the kitchen table. After being dope sick for three days, driving seven hours and getting well, Jess and I finally got an hour of sleep. Drizzle is gone, but that's fine, we can cuddle and have sex without him here.

I find Jess and wake her up. We go to eat our pizza, finally getting some food in our bellies before a blissful night of cuddling and groping 

We get to the table and freeze as we see what's waiting for us.

""Did you eat it..?"" She asks, already knowing the answer.

""Fucking Drizzle."" 

We both want to cry. That was our splurge. And there's two pieces left.

Fuckin Drizzle.

Like if I eat too much, I throw up. Sometimes I randomly wake up in the middle of the night and puke or puke first thing in the am. I've read that digestion is really slow on opana (and maybe most opiates) and that food will literally just sit there and rot and not digest which is what I'm throwing up. Is that correct?

Anyway, right now, my stomach just feels uncomfortable and I want it to stop. I did drink quite a bit last night and would be hung over if I wasn't on OP. 

Anyway, Is there anything I can take along with opana to ease nausea? Does anyone else have this problem?

I have passionflower, dramamine, teas (green, black, chamomille), asian ginseng, ashwagandha, california poppy, kava kava, st john's word, attivan and tagamet. Any of those good for this? Kinda wanted to just list off my herb collection, too lol",1483825322.0

I've just recently tried heroin for the first time about a month ago since I no longer have a connect for pills. I knew I was getting middled and overpaying but it seemed like decent dope and it was convenient so I didn't mind.  Then last week I got too trusting and got taken and was left with nothing. I started getting the weakest of w/d's and since I'm on vacation I didn't have anything to take my mind off it so I decided to try cold copping and try my luck. 

I get to a well know open air market, see what's going down and then park a block away. I walk 20 feet from my car and get approached by a guy: 
Guy: Hey man, what you need, black? 
Me: Yeah
Guy:  How much? 
Me: $20
Guy: *gives me smallest of balloons
Me: *stare at him with hand still open
Guy: You said $20, right? 
Me: Yeah
Guy: That's a dub
Me: That's not like any dub I've seen
Guy: That's tar, that's that fire
Me: *go to hand back ""dub""
Guy: Fiiiiiiiine *spits out another balloon ""here""
Me: Thanks *hand over $20 and walk to car

After driving away I stop to have a look and these bags are even smaller than I thought but not super bad. I mix it up with some baking powder and try a little bump, burns really good, 6-8 minutes later and I  realize that my middle had been doing more than overcharging me. This shit was great, and lasted me well into the night, it's gonna be a good weekend :)

TL/DR - cold copped for first time, not a big bag but fire. ",1483821754.0

Rich Kid

I certainly didn’t feel like a rich kid. My suitemates didn’t think I was one: my room and my appearance being a constant mess. Dirty clothes lined my dorm room, and there were concerns I was bulimic from my university RA due to my frequent vomiting. In reality, I was in severe opiate withdrawal, with a $600 overdraft in one checking account, and a $40 overdraft in the other. As any dopesick addict would, I called my biggest enabler. 

I: Oh hi Mama, how are you? How’s life? How’s Papa doing?

M: Ivan, we’re good, are you okay? You sound a little… chaotic.

I: No, no! I’m absolutely fine! I just need to ask a small favour of you. 

M: Ivan, I’ve already given you more than your $2000 allowance this month, plus your $2000 credit card limit, it’s only the second week of the month!

I: Why would you assume it’s about money??

M: Ivan…

I: Mama, it’s just I have a $40 overdraft, and I really want to take my Nikki (my ""fiance"" at the time) out to dinner since it’s our anniversary and she’s angry at me, and I haven’t been feeling well and-

M: Ivan, this is the last time I’m doing this. I hate myself for doing this. It causes me so much pain; I don’t sleep at night…

I: Mam, it’s’ not for that… I really mean it, it’s the last time.

M: I’ll QuickPay you $60, but that’s it for the month. I mean it! 

I: Mama I very much appreciate it, I’m sure Nikki will be ecstatic.

M: Oh Ivan, you don’t sound well, are you sure you’re okay?

I: Ma, I’m doing great, I got an A on my last midterm!

M: Can you make your grades visible to me online? I feel like I'm an enabler.

I: Ma, I promise I will, but I have to go to class right now, love you! Bye!

Let’s play spot the lies. 

1. I’m absolutely fine. I was so dopesick my sheets were soaked in addition to having vomited twice in the past 30 minutes. 

2. $40 overdraft. More like $600. 

3. It’s the last time. More like hundredth last. 

4. I got an A on my most recent midterm! I couldn’t even remember the last time I’d showed up to class, never mind gotten any grade in any midterm. 

5. I promise. The ultimate lie.

After refreshing the Chase website over fifty times, I finally had a positive balance of $60 in one of my checking accounts. I quickly called TK, my heroin and crack addict dealer who almost certainly had some form narcissistic personality disorder. Thank God (who the fuck is God?) he answered the call.

TK: Yo, my negro Ive! What up?

I: TK you gotta help me, bro, I've never been so sick in my life. I got $60 I can get from the ATM, can you help me out?

TK: Damn bro the least I can do is $100. I’m kinda far from you tonight at a friend’s house bro… I don’t know if I can help you out.

I: TK, I’ll give you collateral, I’ll get an Uber there. TK I have a watch worth $25,000.

TK: Ive I know you’re rich, but I don’t like fronting.

I: TK, I’m begging you.

TK: Fine head on over, just hurry the fuck up okay?

I immediately ordered an Uber, got out $50 in cash (fucking American ATM fees) and told the driver to get me there as quickly as possible. It took me 20 minutes to find TK, and I was almost considering going to the emergency room. He seemed to take hours to weigh our the black tar heroin that we were about to consume, and I gave him my Patek Philippe watch to hold on to since I didn’t have enough money. 

“I’ll give you $50 in the morning, TK, I promise.” 

Finally, TK shot up first, then TK shot me up (I had just started using intravenously and wasn’t very good at it, and I wasn’t prepared to waste any precious heroin). Within seconds Ivan was back, the Ivan with and charm, the Ivan who could debate politics for hours, the Ivan who got accepted to Princeton University… and rejected it for a West Coast to be further away from family. I was me again; not some pathetic dopesick junkie, I was the rich kid who could do anything. We watched TV, smoked cracked, and shot heroin for the rest of the wee hours of the morning, and then I left.

The next day the father of TK’s friend (it turned out we’d been staying at his friend’s house) showed up to take his son to rehab. I remembered my watch had fallen in between the sofa cushions. I never saw that watch again. My father had given it to me as a present for my sixteenth birthday, and I had just traded in the object which had more sentimental value to me than anything else (as we'll as a monetary value) for $40 of dope. 
There are no words to describe my shame; I didn’t feel like a rich kid, I felt like the biggest fucking loser on the planet.",1483815593.0

What I'm wondering is how much of a waste would it be if I was to do a high dose in around 4-5 hours?  A high dose for me is about 40mg.

I know oxy doesn't really work nearly as effectively if you redose it within a 24 hour period, and I want to get my moneys worth out of these pills.  However, I'm hoping this will be less of an issue with following up a lower dose with a higher dose.

I had overdosed,  turned blue, and was taken to the er where they injected narcan. 

Holy cow that was a new hell and remembering it is one way to keep me sober now because I had passed out and awoken in a painful nightmare. Except it turned out to not be a nightmare. It's a memory now burned into my skull. 

Besides being asked questions as I came to, everything was in like a slow motion. My throat felt weird too, cold very cold. But then every muscle started to spasm like crazy. I was also screaming because I felt as if cold water was being injected into my veins and muscles and my skin was ripping itself from the inside. 

Then I heard the word catheter and I howled. That was painful. 

During this, each time I closed my eyes I kept having this image of a power plant starting up like my subconscious was like hey your coming back online, and fast. 

I heard them say here comes something for the spasms, another injection. Then I started going in and out, hearing hit him with a stimulant again. 

But I kept going in and out until waking up in the icu with low everything basically. BP took all night to return to normal then I was discharged. 

Precipitated withdrawals, great stuff. 

Was tough at first to fall asleep, now 2 weeks later I still have sleep issues like waking up with that cold water feeling. And I've got cravings like a sob.

He has some decent shit, can't find anyone to buy it, and is hoping that I'll take it off his hands. I decline, because light bags, 4 day wait times, and fake product all rub me the wrong way. 

I'm a ""my word is my bond"" kind of guy who goes out of his way to repay his debts, and unfortunately, this dude knows it. He immediately offers me a front...and even though I only use occasionally, random credit on one of my favorite drugs is just too good to pass up. 

I pick up what is supposed to be .4 and go about my day. I don't even bother looking at it until I get home. I pull it out...i laugh...toss it on my scale...about 80mg.

Next time I see him, I try to be nice. I really do. ""Hey man, you gave me the wrong bag. It's all good, just wanted to let you know"". Hell, I even reassure him that I'll still tip him for the front. 

He tells me that he knew the weight, and has suddenly decided to start charging four times local street value for his bags. 

As I said, this guy is usually far from impressive...but suddenly charging $40 for the equivalent of a light stamp? This is an unprecedented level of fucktardary. I know I should have avoided him completely, but this is faaar from the usual shenanigans. 

Any advice? He actually expects every penny, and will likely resort to violence if he doesn't get it. I can handle that if I have to, but I'd really rather avoid it (full time job, supporting a household and a disabled mother...the potential physical damage and legal repercussions would be unpleasant). Of course, paying him and going about my business is even less desirable...can't afford a $40 stamp, and quite frankly, it is fucking insulting. ",1483977012.0

I have been using codeine sporadically in the last years, at some point I decided to switch to acetaminophen + coffee for pain treatment (I have sinusitis) and to stash codeine pills and try using them recreationally, but they don't seem to have a major effect on me, the most I've done is 210mg (on an empty stomach) and I weigh 70kg (154lb), I made sure I did the CWE correctly but I only get a very light buzz and my sinuses stopping aching (obviously).

I've also tried 100mg tramadol one time and it doesn't seem to do anything.

I recently stopped doing codeine since crushing the pills and extracting was not worth it for me, I switched immediately to psychedelics after I discovered DXM, but I've always been interested in a decent opiate experience.

Thoughts? Do I have a natural tolerance to opiates? Suggestions? I was thinking about potentiating codeine with DXM, one time I tried 120mg on a first plateau (still pretty meh from the codeine), it seems that prescription codeine (and tramadol, which I wouldn't mess with on DXM) is the only opiate I can get my hands on, I would probably find heroin but I'm not interested in trying it.",1483976450.0

All my friends who used are now sober so theyre no help.

I have 1 guy left who is a middle man and used to be cool. Take me to his dude and his guy would come out and hand it to him and then he handed it to me. So no shady shit. But I still break him off a nice chunk.
The past two times supposly he got ripped off and gave me something wasnt dope. Last night told me he was getting tar and then did a 180 and got some powder. So I paid about $60 for $20 dope.

so here goes... a very close person in my life died recently from an overdose and after coping with it i decided to quit myself. i relapsed in the summer and have been using  h daily until i began tapering in december. i quit completely the second week of december after slowly weening myself off until my tolerance was low enough to be fine with 2mg subs and later tramadol. today was the third day that i have not taken anything and most of my w/d symptoms have dissapeared except waking up with my shirt soaked of sweat in the morning but after a hot shower i am fine for the rest of the day. well today i randomly checked the mail and there was 1g of heroin i had ordered some time ago. and lets just say i just smoked 1-2 points so looks like even after the horror of kicking this evil bitch over the holidays where i spent with family trying to not freeze to death and shit myself and going through w/d without anyone noticing i have undone all that work. hopefully this is just a one time slip but i have a horrible feeling that i won't be able to stop myself from smoking a point or two tomorrow or the next day and slowly go back to using daily again. i know i am the one that fucked up and im going to regret this in the morning but i guess once a junkie always a junkie... anyways i hope everyone else going through this doesn't fuck up like me and beat this bitch without looking back. i will hopefully join you sober guys soon

I don't use opiates daily any more, haven't for around a year now. Every now and then I chip though with various substances, usually H or PST. 

Do tricyclic antidepressants and opiates have any dangerous interactions I should know about? Looking online I can't really find anything bad, but there's not much information. 

Does anyone else take a TCA daily alongside opiates? I'm currently on 100mg a day of nortriptyline, and have been for several months. The only risk I can see there being is nortriptyline somehow mixing with heroin or the alkaloids in PST and somehow potentiating respiratory depression. However I do see a lot of people online being prescribed TCAs alongside their opiate prescriptions as a potentiator. 

I do know that I'm allowed to drink on it, and have gotten black out drunk more than a few times and taken my 100mg dose without any side effects. I've also taken opiates alongside it multiple times but am always worried about taking noddy doses.

I'd like to try mixing them in the future.

I had some heroin though, so when I really wanted to stop feeling this LSD effect I tried to smoke some of H. And it worked very nice, I was super comfortable again and didn't even pay attention to LSD effects and did my own things.


So I have two questions:


1. How does heroin mix with LSD in terms of subjective experience? 



2. Will heroin calm you down when you have bad trip? I want to have full trip but I am scared of getting into uncomfortable feeling (I can't really describe it) that is unique to LSD in my experience, and not being able to escape it for hours.

I learned a lot from the healthy chunk of clean time I put together, and probably the most important thing I learned is that time don't mean shit. Definitely not when it comes to quantity. I've known people with 1 year clean living fuller, happier lives, than people with 30 years clean. Recovery isn't just an absence of drugs; it's an entire change of lifestyle aimed at addressing the issues that led one to drugs in the first place. Because if any of you guys or gals are like me: then drugs were never your problem, they were your solution.

I think it's worth mentioning that when I refer to clean time and recovery, I'm talking about full on abstinence. You can't really say ""Yeah I'm taking x drug daily, but I'm totally clean"". That's a version of recovery called harm reduction, and I'm not arguing it's merit because it works amazingly for some, but it's not the same thing as being clean. Being on a maintenance program is not the same thing as being clean. The only thing that's considered clean is the full abstinence of mind and mood altering substances. 

Back to my original question: one of the things that led to my relapse when I had my clean time, was having a mental relapse months before. For me a mental relapse was logging into an old group I was apart of, and going through and looking at all the pictures of dope. Reading all the posts about everyone doing dope. Drooling to dope. Which led to me having a day dream of everything that would be involved with me getting high. I basically sat there wide awake and got high in my mind. It was only a few months after that until I actually got high, and trashed all my beautiful clean time. Some of the best, most productive years of my life. 

So why are you clean/sober guys/gals on here? If heroin/opiates have done so much to your life that you've had to take the time and get clean from them, why come back here and look at pictures of dope all day? I get that some might say ""well I like hearing all the horror stories to remind me of what it's like"". Well you could go to a meeting, or even r/recovery and get that, but without all the dope porn/romanization of using. 

Not trying to trash anyone, or their choices. I'm just truly interested as to why some people trying to change their lives, are still lurking in this sub. What do you get out of it? Also open to having a healthy debate/conversation about this!",1483932182.0

Everyone on the internet talks about dosing a few hundred grams and it being strong af, i used to dose 750g when i first started, then as I started down the rabbit hole my every day dose grew to 1.5-2.5kgs, then in the last few months as a result of a bit more disposable income it's spiralled progressively from 3 to 4 to 5 to 6 kg to get a buzz.

Best part about him is that he doesn't have a job. So dealing is his full time job. He plays it very safe. He's been in the game for 10+ years and has never been caught/investigated or anything. He's got any drug I could ask for. He delivers anywhere local and is always on time and punctual. I have been going to him for roxy30s for 3 years now. His prices are decent, but he always hooks me up when I buy bulk and cuffs me whatever I need if I'm low on cash. I've become close enough to him that he lets me come to his house when he's too lazy to go out (which is rare, but understandable sometimes). He's always answers my texts within 15 min of them sending. Of the hundreds and hundreds of time I've called him, he's only been out of pills three times. He's become a really good friend and I wouldn't snitch on him no matter how much jail time I was facing. 

The reason for this post is that when I picked up today, I accidentally gave him an extra $100 dollar bill that was stuck to another one. Normally any other drug dealer would just keep it and say nothing about it and when asked, they would deny it and just keep it. I hadn't even noticed the money was missing when he called me and told me, he even offered to drive back to my house, 25 min away from his, to give it back to me. It's that type of honesty that isn't found that much in the world of drug dealing. I wouldn't go to anyone else!

I have been on off on off on off a poppy seed tea train for a few years and I put myself through a self-imposed taper as my one and only New Year's Resolution. I am on day 3, tomorrow will be day 4 of no poppy seed tea at all. I've been careful with the loperamide to give myself a break but it helps SO much to stop the sweats that I want to end that too. 

I have found good luck with Loperamide in the past so I don't want to get into the debate about whether or not it helps. It helps me a huge, huge amount and serves as my best method to get past the most difficult cessation periods. But how long to people typically depend on Loperamide for their taper?

I have cold hands - absolutely all-the-damn-time when I am on the death broth tea (what I call poppy seed tea). Loperamide causes hot hands for me on the other side of the coin. If anyone has cold hands during their poppy seed tea runs, how long do you typically notice this side effect after stoppage?

I feel like my sex drive is more like a volatile witches' brew of brain chemicals fighting each other. When I am on the tea I am barely interested at all in sex. When I am off it I want it every other day or so. Today was the first time I have masturbated in a week and will likely be having sex later tonight too. I am wondering if that is my normal sex drive coming back or if I am just experiencing brain chemical anomalies.

The other day my friend hit me up telling me that her buddy was able to get hands on some China white.

China white is so rare to come by where I live. From my understanding, most of the H that goes around in my area is mainly BTH or brown powder. 

I was under the impression that China (real China) is nearly impossible to find, and if you do happen to stumble on it, chances are it's likely cut with fent or fent entirely. (U.S -West Coast). I usually will pass up the opportunity for that reason, and stick with what I'm used to grabbing. (Brown powder)

I was ready to grab my normal stuff but im really curious now. She told me that the guy she got it from actually had it tested because he wanted to know the purity as well and determine what it was cut with. 

SHe messaged me this morning telling me he got the results back. 

Tested as:
- Diamorphine hydrochloride
- 62-64% purity
- Cut with vitamin B and vinegar

Her and her bf told me because of the purity, it would be $150/g or $400 a ball. They would do any amount under a g as well. They also offered to give me a tester as well before spending that $$, which made me feel a bit better. 

I don't think she's trying to pull a fast one on me, since she did offer the tester. I've known her and her boyfriend for almost 8 years now so it's not jus some random but you can never be to careful with new stuff.  I don't know what to do. It'll be a few days until I get paid. Idk if I should stick with what I'm used to and know I'll be good til payday or risk it and get the CW. I don't want to risk it and get some bunk shit leaving me dry until payday :/.  


1) pick up my normal stuff? (2 gs powder $120)
2) pick up the China (half g-$80)

Should I take the chance and get the CW? Or play it safe and get the brown powder. I just don't know how real it could be..and most stories I've read regarding China in the US are all about fent.

He told me I would only need to do .2- because of how strong it is. 

Thank you in advance for your feedback. It's much appreciated. 

Happy nodding! ✌🏽️",1483915817.0

I smoked 15-20mg of perfectly good Heroin #3 over foil with little wastage about 1 hour ago. 

I felt mildly lightheaded within 20 seconds, and felt (this is important) a definitive pain relief effect (I could test this : I suffer from a sore abscess for which i'm due to receive surgery very soon - poking it 10 minutes after smoking was not as painful as usual). I also felt a tiny bit calmer, but historically I felt much more calm from using basic benzos.

I didn't feel anything else. No euphoria, no nod. Certainly nothing like what I read online on Erowid ,where people talk about it in poetic terms ""wrapped in cotton"", ""orgasm"". Certainly nothing like it's depicted on television or movies.

Now, I realize many will say 'consider yourself blessed etc' and I agree, however for the sake of the question here I'm trying to understand if I could be part of the people who don't produce CYP2D6 enzymes or if it's something else.

The questions being: assuming I'm not producing CYP2D6 enzymes, would I still have received some form of pain relief effect or none at all? Or is it something else? (not enough dosage-wise?, people on erowid are lying?, Heroin is actually non-euphoric?).

i have attempted suicide four times but been suicidal for a very long time.

have never gone deep into opiates because i know how good it feels and how it takes the pain away so well. tried healing myself with psychedelics for a long time with very limited success (basically was able to get rid of ocd)

benzos do help, but really want that opiate euphoria and i basically don't want to be in pain any longer or i'll kill myself.

current drug habits are xanax (0-1mg/day, on rare days more than 1mg), weed, occasional mdma or coke when socializing. only opiate i currently occasionally use is codeine i get prescribed for back pain. not enough for daily use though. all current drug use besides codeine is black market acquired.

i'm totally proficient in using the darknet, but price prevents me from using basically any opiate besides heroin. i've done heroin 4 times, snorted heroin salt (#4).

now i'm a nerd and this post is obviously not the only thing i'll base my decision on, but i hope maybe someone will be able to share something of value that i wouldn't have known otherwise.


so in terms of medical value, ease to obtain, price/dose ratio and health side effects, it appears to me that codeine would be most suited for me.

i cannot however, get enough prescribed to get addicted to it and codeine, like all opioids, is retardedly expensive to buy on the black market. can heroin be used safely as a substitute? at €80/g it seems to be the cheapest opioid, besides maybe fentanyl or UB-4447 whatever that thing is called, but i would prefer to stick to non-synthetic opioids, and i know heroin is semi-synthetic, but compared to fentanyl it's basically straight outta the poppy.

is it ridiculous to expect to be able to use heroin as casually as codeine? are there any other options? including maybe lying about pain to obtain a prescription, i'm open to ideas. i live in a country with socialized healthcare so that would mean incredibly low prices.

kindly spare me the advice to ""get help"" and ""don't take opiates, it'll ruin your life"". therapy is not a magic bullet. my life is already ruined. let me at least live without pain. i consider myself responsible with drugs and i can envision me living with an opiate addiction for many decades without causing any major damage to my life, but i recognize the chance exists. i am willing to risk it. i am in too much pain.

i don't want to sound too dismissive of any answers though, if you beautiful people have advice to share i will gladly listen. for example if someone recommends sticking to benzos instead of heroin i will honestly consider that, in my mind they are very similarly harmful, but am inexperienced with opiates so i could be wrong.

i have only read handful of posts on this sub through my years on reddit, but i've always been impressed with the camaraderie shown by everyone.

this became really long, thank you if you read the whole thing

I got one buddy that is always trying to meet early in the AM before we both go to work, especially if he has a stressful day ahead of him.  I'd love for him to do a fat shot before a big meeting and have the acid start coming on hard and fast and him give me a call saying something is off with the dope and I could be like ""Naw, you just got dosed, good luck with your presentation to the CEO.""

Haven't slept still at all, just absolutely miserable and losing my mind. Since I'm staying with my mom while detoxing, before she went to work she sat down with me and said, ""you're not going to use, I know you won't. You've come too far. What can we do to get you through the next couple of days?""


Now I've been skeptical of kratom because my tolerance/length of use is so high and other 'miracles' such as lope did nothing for me. Even suboxone doesn't sit well. So my mom and I looked at our options, got some info, and we decided to try kratom. She drove me straight to the nearest headshop and paid way too much for 75 capsules. I took 2 g initially and another 2 g in the next hour, then got into a boiling hot bath. 2 hours have passed and my hellish withdrawals went from %99 to about %30 now. But God what a huge difference! I'm still very sore and emotional but compared to the brutal blunt misery of acute withdrawal this is RELIEF. I'm so happy I could cry. I'm almost to the other side of this and can't wait for freedom! Onto day 5!

At this point I'm so far in, have shed so much sweat and tears, and am totally consumed by guilt for what my mom has been doing for me. The lady is a fucking saint. Working 2 jobs and taking care of my dog and I while I detox. She's made sure I have weed, cigarettes, whatever I need to be comfortable. My mom and I have a rocky past but I'm her only child and today when I was at a breaking point she looked me in the eyes and told me I was sick, I was an addict and that she would do everything to help me she could as long as I wanted it bad enough. I'm resolved to get back on my feet and make her happy. I had a year clean last year before this relapse and man I can't wait to get back to sobriety. 


So yeah, kratom! Wow again. I'm blown away it helped this much and it only took 4-5 gs (which I plan on tapering future doses to nothing over the next few days) but I'm sure being into day 4 of withdrawal had an effect on it too. I was especially skeptical of buying from a smoke shop but thought it certainly wouldnt hurt anything to try! So glad i did! Sorry for rambling! Stay up friends.



Edit: just in case anyone was wondering, I bought ""Krave botanicals"" Bali kratom and it was $44 for 75 .5 g capsules. So far it's been worth it as long as I don't think of the dope I could have bought with it...but since my goal is to be clean it's a worthwhile investment.",1483910169.0

He wasn't in the gifted excelled classes too. In High School we never really hung out, all he wanted to do was get high with his girlfriend that I hate, and all I wanted to do was play video games. We'd hangout occasionally but I never smoked with him. Sophomore year, he got into pills. He took prescribed ADHD meds too, but the moment we hit High School he started selling them. We'd hangout more but I still wouldn't smoke or get high with him. He then got into synthetics and I would drive him to places. Still wouldn't do it. He left school and went to a Community Center. I went to Home School. The next year I went back to school, he went to Home School. Thats when he started selling more and more. We'd still occasionally hangout. After graduation I started hangout with him, I started smoking weed. The night he called a Coke Dealer over was my final straw, I didn't talk to him much after that. We'd occasionally message each other but nothing would take. I start my life, find jobs I love, find what I'm here for. I see a post on facebook saying he got arrested for 4 felonies and 3 misdemeanors. I immediately come back into his life, I took blame for what he did on some level. I take him to his court cases, he doesn't know I blame myself a little. It kills me that he's about to go on IOP and he won't get clean.

Not that it matters but I've been active within this sub for the better part of a year but had to ditch my old username due to some OPSEC concerns. Better safe than sorry...

Anyways, came across some interesting research and wanted to see if anyone had experience in the Bernese Method of Induction? More info here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4959756/

The premise is relatively simple. Rather than wait 24hrs to begin the induction process, you start tapering up with micro doses, while concurrently still using. Tapering up the suboxone, while tapering down heroin.

I've seen people post anecdotal feedback that you can indeed avoid PWS by dosing your subs low enough, so that you don't have 100% receptor coverage.

A chemical imbalance resulting from depression or current environment. And two being the added neurotransmitters from drugs.

When you are already depressed, some drugs are an instant fix, and it's hard to get out of that situation when it fixes everything, especially when you're in a bad place in life that stopping using would make life seem unbearable. Now if you use long enough you end up in the place anyways, regardless how good the starting/current living conditions are.
Point being it's a mental state that is fixed by drugs so easily, and once you learn how well it seems to ""fix"" everything, it's hard to get out. When in reality the real root of the problem is often hard to address and especially when addicted/withdrawing, seems an impossible dream. So you just use again.

The OP asked four relatively heavy questions. 


1. Why did you start and continue on doing something that you know where it can lead (health problems / social problems / heavy addiction).

2. Do you acknowledge that starting on opiates it's a very risky thing?

3. Do you think you have total control of your habit and know for sure you won't end up stealing from your friends or worse?

4. Do you feel ""hooked""? Would you rather stop taking opiates if you could?

Since this showed up near the top of ""Opiates"" search results, I didn't notice that it was archived and spent about two hours thinking and writing out a reply. I'm posting it here in the hopes of reviving this outstanding thread...and because I spent two damned hours on this. 

1: Drugs of all kinds have always been a serious interest of mine. The idea of altering one's perceptions, mental and emotional reality, and overall neurochemistry to achieve states not otherwise possible for our species...that's some magical shit. I waited until I was in my late teens/early 20s before experimenting with anything to avoid developmental repercussion, chose a single vice/addiction (nicotine), and started carefully and respectively enjoying all manner of drugs. I continue to use virtually all of them (including opiates, my favorite being IV heroin) because...i can. I can prioritize, keep my responsibilities in the forefront, manage my finances, and occasionally get home after a long day of work and shoot up. I've never been financially or personally compromised due to drugs, have avoided physical and psychological addiction, and maintain my health and self respect (with one possible exception) ...so I see no reason to not continue making my life more uniquely pleasant and interesting when possible. 

2. Absolutely. Opiates can obviously be highly addictive. But at the end of the day, everything boils down to choice. Choose to educate yourself about the drugs you want to use, choose to make drugs an addition to your life instead of its biggest focus, choose to consider the consequences of your actions and hold yourself accountable...or choose not to. 

3: I am absolutely 100% in control of my opiate use. Everyone has flaws, everyone has weaknesses. The exception I mentioned in #1? Alcohol. Ironically, I have zero issues with responsible heroin use, but have been known to drink too often and too much. The thing about that is...i see it. I may not like it, but I acknowledge it, accept it, and take responsibility for it. If I have booze in my home, I drink it. So I do not keep a liquor cabinet. If I want to drink, i purchase enough alcohol for one night. I stop to consider my recent alcohol intake, my finances, WHY I want to drink, and what responsibilities being drunk/hungover may interfere with. By understanding that I have difficulty controlling my drinking when I have a bottle in front of me, I can compensate and thus control my drinking.   Now, I once went several years without touching heroin simply because my dealer became my long term girlfriend, and after we split the drug had some unpleasant emotional resonance. I have turned down free dope because it was late and I had to be up early for work. Once again...choice and accountability (it may seem as though I'm bragging...and to an extent, I suppose I am. But this outlook didn't just magically happen. It took serious self reflection and mental/emotional work, starting even before my first high). 

4: To an extent...yes. I am hooked. Not on opiates specifically, and not to the degree that drugs are required for me to be happy or live my life...but if I have the ability, I will continue to use them indefinitely. They can offer so much...indescribable euphoria, instant relaxation, almost supernatural stress/pain relief, entirely new methods of introspection, self evaluation, and growth. New ways to see, hear, and feel the world around you. Incredible empathic connections with others. Even experiences that extend beyond what we know and believe, moments that can only be described as transcendent. 

Drugs are fucking amazing, and they will never hurt you...unless you decide to use them to hurt yourself. The more you enjoy them, the more caution you have to exercise...because if you fuck up too often, or too detrimentally, you loose them. Permanently. 

(Note: I'm likely presenting myself as one seriously put-together, successful, and we'll adjusted fellow. I'm actually a bloody train wreck of a man who happens to have his shit together, especially when it comes to drugs.)

So a little backstory here - I lost my father to alcoholism in 2006 - as he had come back from Vietnam with a heroin addiction, and replaced that vice with alcohol once he got back home, and never got the help he needed. 

It was very hard to deal with, as I was just coming of age at the time (I was 15). I never liked drinking much myself, and vowed that I would not let the same thing happen to me. I was real fucked up mentally, developed an eating disorder, but was not abusing any substances ( though I am a weed smoker, I don't consider weed to harmful or addictive whatsoever). 

Fast forward to 2011, and I had overcome my eating disorder, but I developed a full on opiate addiction, and finally began a suboxone program at the end of 2016. I didn't want to believe that shit ran in the family until I get a text from my uncle this past Christmas saying he needed to talk to me about something important. Turns out he's been on methadone for 10 years due to heroin addiction himself, and wanted to come clean to me about it.

I declined to tell him of my own issues, as I worried he may bring it up to my Grandma - she is too old for the stress of that news (94 years old), and I stand to inherit a decent sum from her one day, and I really don't want that knowledge influencing anything, as it is my only hope of paying off my student loans. I am unsure that she would change her entire will just because of that, but it is not a risk I am willing to take.

My question is - I was just wondering how many of you out there have family members who are addicts, and how you dealt/deal with that. ",1483985740.0

Really really need some help here. Been doing straight fent intranasaly for around 6 months. Fuck tons of it each day. 

Opted to see a Dr. and join a subs program. I went in to my first appointment just shy of 24 hours since my last dose. They started me on 4mg. I asked them about premeditated WD and they said it's possible but best to get it out of the way. 

2 hours in and I cannot describe the hell I endured. They gave me another 4mg of bupe. It only made things worse. Sped up the clock and threw me into insane WD and a super bad LSD trip. Not joking, that's how it felt. Eventually I'm able to leave the doctors office but only because I lied and told them I was doing better. I took 8mg again that night and again the next morning but nothing helped. I was experiencing 1000x the worst WD I had ever know. This went on for 26 hours. 

Couldn't take it anymore and took a bit of fent that night and the next morning and flushed the rest. Have been going CT ever since and it's nothing compared to that awful, hellish, unimaginable pain I was going through. 

My plan was to wait until I was in severe WD and restart the subs to avoid PWD again because quite frankly, I would have done anything to get out of that. 

The WDs right now are so fucking mild in comparison it's outrageous haha. Don't get me wrong, WD from fent is a hell I didn't think I could handle but they seem so tame compared to the fuckery I went through. I feel like I could muscle through this no fucking problem. Been 3 days since I took anything and my connects are cut. 

The advice i am seeking is what to do going forward? I have a script for subs but I don't know if I should use them. I genuinely want to get clean. 

I probably should mention that my wife joined the subs program at the same time and is doing well. I don't want to rock her boat, just want to be on the same page but my experience with Bupe so far... well I fucking loathe that substance. I fucked up, I know. Ideas? 

Thanks all, much love.

Edit: This happened over the coarse of early last week until, well, now. I am sure I skipped over some details so please let me know if I missed any pertinent information. 

The PWDs were so bad I had to call in dead to work. The doc backed me on that part though. And fucking god damn, it's -9 here. I do hate WDing in the cold. I miss this sub.",1483978521.0

I just found that was super fucking easy to chat someone up for drugs if your chill and play it cool good things can come your way.  Now i hope my boy is there tomorrow morning so we can continue our conversation hehehe.

tl;dr so talked with a dude off a freeway offramp on the way to work and just chattin him up he said he could hook up some H.  Totally random conversation but that how chill it was to just ask about it and it coulda been possible (maybe) to score some.",1484111709.0

Everything from oxycodone to blood pressure meds.

So, without thinking, my mom told me that she threw them all out in our trashcan when she got home. Why would she do this to me? Of course, I found the bag in the trash.

I don't think there as beastly as people make them out to be,"I have a really bad life. No friends. No girlfriend. No real family. I often feel suicidal. I'm a criminal.  

I go through a lot more stress than your average person and I often feel on edge. Guess ptsd is the best way to describe it. I'm telling you that so you know I have nothing keeping me grounded. No family to live for. No great future ahead of me. I'm scum 

I first started using opiates after getting a tooth pulled. I liked the high and I started to drink a lot of lean. Then I realized when I was nodding off I had 0 interest in women or having sex. So I started choosing lean/pills over girls and partying and pretty much everything. Past few months opiates and weed have been my only vices. I turned down a lot of pussy for pills lol. 

A few weeks ago I got some hydro took them all and didn't even get buzzed. I was pissed off so I quit cold turkey for a few weeks. Today I took 90mg of oxy on an empty stomach after being sober for the past few weeks. I got no high to speak of. 

So I'm making the decision to quit cold turkey. As much as I love the high it's just not sustainable for me anymore. And I'm not going to upgrade to needles or start using cut up street dope. 

Not gonna throw my life away chasing a feeling. 

And looking back on it those first couple highs really were the best. Was all downhill after that. Opiates are like a beautiful girl. You can have some really great times with them, especially in the honey moon phase, but you gotta know when to let them go. Just can't last forever. 

People make it seem like opiates and drugs in general are some kinda beast that you can't control. But in reality everyone makes their own decisions in life. My uncles a heroin addict. My moms an alcoholic. My aunts a crackhead. I've done all three of those drugs in large amounts (pills instead of h tho), I could go do all those drugs right now if I Wanted too. Wouldn't even have to pay for the coke or alcohol. But I don't. It's mind over matter. You make your own choices. Drugs can't ruin you if you don't let them.",1484102497.0

It's the classic junkie in me talking because I love opiates and the beautiful nod, but to me its analogous to chasing a fat hit then jumping straight into a cold shower.

It has to be a social thing right? Just Has to be. I guess you get all the confidence and verbosity of Coke mixed with the ethereal and added euphoria of the heroin?

I'm assuming no mater the ROA the Coke is going detract from the nod... So what's the appeal, and in what context would you want to be speed balling?

There are a couple reasons to quit. First, I know that I will require dose increases in the future due to tolerance. Also, I am tired of the bullshit from the office ladies when picking up my monthly prescription and also the noise I get from the pharmacy. I get it...I am a drug addict.

Will I be very sick after a 3 week detox? I feel normal. And other thoughts.,"I've moved over to the PNW Washington from Indiana, and I have been clean now for about 3 weeks after previously detoxing from suboxone (jumping at .25). Withdrawals were not bad at all this time. The first week was rough, with some pain, but after that it was mostly anxiety, depression, and occasional sneezing. In fact today I don't feel sick at all really. Ibuprofen has helped take the edge off here at the tail end of sub detox. First and longest time I've been off opiates/opioids, and I'm ready to fuck it up.

Please don't judge. 

Obviously my tolerance will be lower, but my question is, will my withdrawals be severe if I do a half g of good tar nasally over 1 or 2 days?

I'm gonna plan on picking up some subs again, and taper if need be. I know how to taper properly now. I must admit, one nice thing about suboxone, is that after a while of being on it, you don't crave or want to use full agonists anymore. At some point, as long as you have not used FA's you will taper without any problems. You don't crave the high anymore, you're not sick, and you still have energy. I tapered down from 4mg to 2mg to 1mg in like 2 weeks. I found 1mg and .5mg to work very well for me. It also made the strips last longer. The hardest jump is to .25. After you are used to .25 you have to go a few days without any suboxone. Ease into it, skip one day, dose, skip one day again, dose, skip 2 days, etc. Eventually you will be able to stop with minimal withdrawals.

The problem is, after going 3 weeks without it, now I'm craving. I'd love to stay clean soon, but I feel like I need to get better treatment. The affordable (aka cheap) treatment in the Midwest suck so bad. I would love to be afforded a better solution someday. I wish my family was rich, or my insurance was good so I could go to a long term treatment center on the beach! 

What ticks me off, is my ex from back home had insurance and a family who could afford it, yet they chose not to go because they can't be locked up away from me, unable to keep an eye on me. My ex is a stage 4 clinger, and drama queen, also verbally abusive, etc. The messed up thing is our roles reversed. 

I used to make really good money as a contract network engineer, and I was paying for 2 people to live for almost 2 years. Once I lost that job, I was depending on my ex to score. Eventually and recently, I was dependent on them for suboxone. Talk about unhealthy, toxic, codependency on both ends. I was literally playing my ex so he would give me subs. Even though they were abusive, rude, disrespectful, lazy... I admit... I am such a POS for using him to keep from getting sick... I used to love this person to death, but I can't allow myself to be sucked into their drama anymore. I might be a dope addict, but I work and have goals.

Sorry going detail into a long post. I took some dextroamphetamine, and I've been super stuck in thought.

Over the last two months I have gotten off of my prescription for the most part. I currently am taking a bit of Subutex each day over the course of the day, and have been doing so for about a month to stave off withdrawal symptoms. Simply put, I need advice on how to go from a bit of Subutex down to nothing. I know that it will be difficult for certain. I understand what withdrawal feels like, and it is not great. It is so not great, in fact, that I know that it will interfere with my day-to-day life just like it did when I quit a year ago. I had the luxury of being on summer break in between classes at university when I last quit. But now, since I am running out of money to spend on supporting this habit since I do not get my prescription anymore. 

I am curious how each of you handle the effects of withdrawal, and if it is possible for you to go about your daily life while dealing with it. If you have any advice on how to keep active and stay on a daily schedule just so I can do what has to be done then please let me know. I am getting desperate, and I don't just want to have to take a week off of life again to do this. I am prepared to just endure hell and vomit and sweat my way through computer engineering and work. I figured that I might as well ask just to see if any of you would know what to do to make that last jump to sobriety though. Any advice that can be offered is welcome.

___

As for some extra details...

I am twenty years old, and have been on and off oxy for about two years. My classes just started up for the semester and I work a job usually around 20 hours per week. I started using again around six months ago when I got a script from my doctor for 15's for chronic pain from a slipped disc in my lower back. My usage peaked at around 120-150 mg/day, but now I currently take about 1 mg of Subutex per day and I feel fine on that.

Just checked EcstasyData (great site that identifies street drugs) and it looks like there are pressed Watson 853 Norco going around that's really fentanyl. Not only is it fentanyl but the press is exactly identical to the real pharma pill. No weird sketchy logo or identifying characteristics that would make you think otherwise..

Now, I guess white pills are easier to counterfeit since there is no dye, but it still fucked me UP knowing how good these presses are getting nowadays. Stay alert people and always test a quarter of your pill before you go in on your stash unless you know for a fact you're getting what you ordered. I know that if I took some fentanyl while my tolerance was still low enough for 2-3 Norco, I might not be here right now (along with some of you brothers and sisters).

Why is there such a problem/prevalence of Fentanyl use on the west side of Canada, yet a few hundred miles south, across an imaginary line, it's no where to be found. maybe something to do with CA's border security/customs? you'd think if a majority of it is coming from china/Asan countries' labs, it would either make it's way south, or at least end up in Cali/Oregon/Washington just as often.

I wake up in the middle of the night to redose, normally at least twice. And no I'm not lying about the amount that is 5000-7000 micrograms every hour or two. It's very difficult to manage my dosage safely. I also have been dealing with horrible side effects for nearly the entire time. Extreme nausea, dizziness, and constipation being the worse. Barely ever holding meals down, etc. I manage now with prescription anti emetics and liquid glycerin suppositories. 

 What I'm worried about most is my fiance finding out. She has no idea, she knows I have a history of drug addiction. I was clean for over a year and relapsed onto oxy a few months ago but got fentanyl because it was cheaper. We got engaged about three weeks ago. I also cannot really miss work as I'm a leader, I manage about 50 people and $7 million a year in sales. I really fucked up and don't know what to do. 

I want off this shit, the high is boring at this point, the side effects finally for the past two days have gotten better. I'm afraid of what the withdrawal will be like, I've withdrawn from fent before at smaller doses and it was vicious. This is going to be hell. Please help me.",1484185000.0

My neighbor has been one of my best friend also for like the last 8 years, And me & my brother were walking over there this morning to get a cigarette. On the way we see a township police car slowly rolling down the street. He didn't stop or say anything to us, So we thought nothing of it. After we smoked a cigarette we head back to my house and I was hella fucked up so I went to sleep. I wake up to my 14 year old sister telling me the cops are here and they want us out front. I quickly threw a shirt and socks on and went out there. They had my whole family on my front porch with no shoes on standing in the rain. This is when I learned my boy was wanted on over a dozen felonies, 10 of which were B&E's two of which were at churches. I have a vicious pit bull and they let me put him in the bathroom because they would shoot him otherwise. They were searching my room and took my dudes huge TV, His Xbox one, and a bag of jewelry which was ours. They kept searching all the while we have dope on a plate under my bed and two bowls just out in the open. They said they didn't care about the bowls & I assumed they didn't look at the plate too hard because they did check under my bed.

I guess my question is, that if youre sniffing dope how easy is it to OD?  Assuming that you try it out, lets say you sniff one stamp and feel ok, but want more - whats a safe amount of time to wait in between lines and on the second bag assuming its the same stamp would you normally have to worry about potency differences very much?

My psychiatrist ask for some documentation (MRI report) and was satisfied that I wasn't a risk. He actually praised me for ""How well I handle myself and my honesty."" 
A PA at the pain management practice refused to prescribe my usual prescriptions because of the duel RXs of opiates and benzo. He DID prescribe the break through med because my PDMP didn't show that I had filled my benzo in over a month. YET, I had filled it during the holidays in another state. These two states share info, so I guess it just had not shown up yet. 
Now I am to return for a urine test to see if the Klonopin is out of my system because I told him the truth, that I had taken a Klonopin the day before. He said come back within two weeks. He was glib, power happy, intent on humiliating me, and overall unsatisfactory. I had told other doctors and PAs in the practice that I took a benzo and it was never recorded in my chart.

Five questions:
1. How long will it take the Klonopin to not show in a urine test?
2. How long will it take PDMO to share from TN to MI?
3. I want this PA to understand that I take the responsibility of taking these drugs seriously. What is the best way to humble this power happy PA?
4. I want the ""flag"" taken off my records, and I want to write a somewhat scolding letter to be put in my file. How can I remove the flag? 
5. Should I ask for a letter to be put in my file to explain my indignation.

But if I actually do go cop dope, I'll just fuck myself over even more. I've tried to overdose before in order to just end this miserable existence and those thoughts are coming back to me now.

I know this question seems dumb, in context you'll understand.


I'm in between suboxone docs, and because subs are quite expensive, I've been using I.M. heroin (idk why people say this isn't safe, I've never had an issue with it) to stave off wds, only getting high on it occasionally because with my tolerance (12mg suboxone/day) it's quite wasteful to do that. 


To help stretch out the worth of each sub, I've been using speed, which lowers my food intake considerably, reducing the bup's metabolism, and sometimes benzos to get by on only 8mg suboxone a day. 


The other day was supposed to be the last day substituting other drugs for subs, so I could get that sparkling clean piss that doctors love. So I decided to indulge a bit. I bought heroin instead of subs, a nice amount of speed, and brought a large I.M. rig (10 mL, with a fat needle), something I never do typically as it CANNOT BE SWALLOWED. 


I drive to my vendor (fuck the word ""dealer""), and get my shit, $35 USD of shard and $25 of H, both high quality. I drive to a spot to I.M. the H. This shit looks a little different than before, tan instead of white and solidish. I take about a quarter of it, mix a bit more than a mL of water, heat, filter, voila, and slam that shit in my thigh (again I.M.).
It might be important to note that I may have broken a blood vessel during the I.M., as the puncture wound bleed (not typical).


Being a little sketched at having done this in a parking lot, I decide I'll find another spot to enjoy a bit of speed. I can tell the shot must be a bit strong, as it kicks in sooner the normal. I'm already sleep deprived (thought not really feeling it) from the last batch of speed I did. I'm starting to feel quite tried as I'm driving, so I decide to pull in to an un-ideal (but not awful) location to counter this with some speed. I'm behind a strip mall, still in ghetto-land. I see a worker briefly open a back door 20 or so feet away to toss some garbage out. 


At this point, I'm getting quite drowsy, I get the pipe for the speed, but before I can get it ready I fall asleep, the drugs still hidden in my sock. 


I awake to someone shaking my shoulder moderately, the car door is open, and there's a few cops and an ambulance. ""Oh, fuck me!"" I say. Immediately I'm not drowsy at all, but furious and depressed. The EMT people ask me to step out. I obey and sit in the ambulance briefly while they take my bp. It's 100 over something or other, a bit low for me. The ambulance leaves immediately afterwards. The cops wave my rig and pipe in my face like they've accomplished something. One cop, the nicer of the pair that remains, takes my info, he then has me sit in the back of his cramped cop-mobile, no cuffs, with the door locked. The nice cop comes in to question some more. **He now, for the first time since I've woken up, claims I overdosed and was given naloxone.** 


When he leaves to chat with his partner, I realize they do not have the drugs. I hurriedly search my socks, but can only find the H. I swallow the bag, distraught that I can't find the speed, and assume it's still somewhere in my car. Bizarrely, after letting me out, the cops immediately find the speed, I say it isn't mine, and they *actually believe me apparently.* I assume they planned on smoking it later.


The cops ask me about whether I've been in some program, I respond truthfully that I only had the shit because my sub doc kicked me out. This seems to buy a little sympathy. They decide to do right by me, as I have no record and am white (that's a joke people), and call some relatives to pick me up rather than taking me to jail. Apparently I'm off the hook with a warning I learn from a relative much later. No career ending felonies that would make McDonald's turn me down (Thank God!).


*Now if I really ODed this all seems a bit weird. I suspect the cops were trying to scare me (thanks but I know ODing is very bad everyone).*


For one, I woke up, apparently not more than 20min after falling asleep (something that happens typically when I get high now, in quite the same manner) with my coat and long sleeve shirt down as normal. Not rolled up for a narcan injection (though nasal sprayers are available I believe. 


Two, in every OD case I've read about, the person is taken to a hospital in case the narcan wears off. Here the ambulance took off in 5 minutes, only taking my bp.


Three, upon waking I was not bluish, did not have a headache, and didn't even feel drowsy (or high), though my rage could have suppressed these symptoms. So if narcan was used, it was used excessively (I still had a decent amount of suboxone in me, which blocks naloxone).


Four, nothing about an actual overdose was mentioned until the cop said narcan about 25-30 minutes after.


So what do you think? Did I nod out, sleep-deprived, in the wrong end of town? Or was the dope waaaay stronger than I anticipated? I can't help but feel the cops were just trying to freak me out, not to mention my family. Help a brother out.

I just passed along some info to a friend the other day about how to use a free method to reduce track marks rather effectively and it seems as if most of the dope shooting community doesn't know this.

I'm back in business school, I made the Dean's List this semester, I'm back under 15% bodyfat, I have a girlfriend who loves me and supports me, and I just generally feel better.  However, this morning I woke up to hear ""-AN'T BELIEVE YOU ARE FUCKING DOING DOPE AGAIN, YOU FUCKING BASTARD, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD LIE TO ME BLAH BLAH BLAH!"" I open my eyes to find my mother rummaging through the drawers under my bed mid-tirade. Incredibly confused, I ask her what is going on, since I haven't touched dope, and the last thing I remember was climbing into bed and passing out.

""I FOUND YOU PASSED OUT IN YOUR BED WITH A FUCKING SPOON NEXT TO YOU!"" My mother screams.  I tell her that the spoon is for my Bed Butter, but she acts like she has no idea what Bed Butter is, so I explain to her that I keep a Costco-sized jar of peanut butter in the drawer under my bed because I usually wake up hungry at 2 or 3 AM every night, and I find it easier to just eat 6-8 tablespoons of peanut butter than get up and make myself a snack every night.  My mother might have believed me, but when she opened the drawer I keep my Bed Butter in, she found a number of lengths of clothesline that I had bought to use on my girlfriend. My girlfriend has somewhat of a DD+LG fetish, and because she gets freaked out and struggles when she gets close to cumming, she had never had an orgasm in her entire life.  As such, she asked me if I would tie her up and force her to cum.  

However, these also happened to be a type of clothesline I once bought and cut into lengths to use as ties. My mother knew this, and when she grabbed them and screamed ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE?!"" I was forced to explain to my mother that my nice sweet girlfriend has a fetish for being treated like a sexual slave (didn't use quite those words).  

Alas, this did not work, and my mother remains absolutely 100% sure that I have relapsed.  I even offered to take a piss test and she refused, because ""[I'd] know some way to beat it.""  I'm pretty bummed out, I go back to school next week, and I have told her that I'm not going to leave the house until then so that she can see that I haven't been using.  But it sucks not getting the benefit of the doubt.  Then again, I lied to her a whole lot when I was a dope fiend. So even though heroin hasn't cost me nearly as much as most of the others here (no hospitalizations, arrests, rehabs, etc.), I realize I have nobody to blame but myself for the situation I'm in.

i have recently come into possession of some provigil, for the first time in years. in doing some reading,  ive learned that mod is an inducer of CYP3A4 enzymes, meaning it can negate the effectiveness of a variety of other drugs. of particular concern are opiates, benzodiazepines, and buprenorphine, so im hoping for some well informed responses in more understandable terms for a non-pharmacologists. 
the benzos and ambien are annoying, because they are a reliable means of coming down from drugs meant to keep me awake. 
however, more concerning are the opiates\bupe. if im on modafinil will i be unable to process opiates? potentially to the extent of causing withdrawl? and if so, and im therefore using suboxone to treat opiate dependency, will the buprenorphine be rendered ineffective as well? 
it seems potentially impossible to use modafinil unless totally clean of both opiates and sub without causing withdrawl. how accurate is this logic?

Since October 2015, when I started using poppy pods, I've gone no more than 4 days without some kind of opiate in my system. Whether it was poppy tea, H or buprenorphine, I've been avoiding sobriety. I've used opiates infrequently for years, but this has been my first real stretch of addiction. I've avoided using heroin too much in favour of poppy seeds, which are a bit cheaper, if more of a pain in the ass and nauseating than heroin, though there were a few two week long periods of smoking heroin every day.

Recently I've been buying buprenorpine off the darknet. It was a going well, I got myself from 6mg down to 1mg a day. I had hoped to reduce to .2 or .1mg before jumping, but my most recent order didn't come. I was left dangling, slowly descending into the clammy hell of withdrawals.

It's pathetic, I'm a grown man, but I've been too reliant on my mother recently. I've had troubles with money, and on several occasions she's enabled me. Only ever as a plan to get off these drugs, though on the few occasions shit went south she bought me some poppy seeds to give me a few days leeway to sort out some buprenorphine to continue my tapering. Well, this last bag was it. She's my mum, she doesn't want to hurt me, but she can't continue to enable me, and I understand that she's doing this (saying no more) out of love. Even before the drugs I would get into moods. I would say awful things to her. Not nasty, I've never been nasty to her. More... Hopeless. Telling her I wanted to die, that ""I'm done"" with life, things that no mother should have to hear from her children. I don't know why I do it, I suspect BPD. My intention isn't to hurt people when I do these things, I don't know why I do them. Luckily they're rare, but my drug use has caused them to become more frequent. But I guess there comes a time where you wake up to the pain you're inflicting on others around you, even if it's not explicitly your intention. I'm better than I used to be, I'm more able to limit the exposure others get to how I feel at my worst. But these moods haven't gone away, and they're my biggest fear in withdrawals. They're something I will have to deal with, but I am afraid I won't be able to. I think, I've thought for a while, it would help a lot to have a therapist to talk to. Has anyone had good experinces with a therapist? I've seen a few before, but could never find it in me to really be honest with them.

So here I am, on my last bag of poppy seeds, and no money for any more. No more excuses, no more ""just for a few days until I can get something sorted"" no more ""I'll go back to the clinic"" or ""I'll email my care-co"". No more hurting the people I love. This is it. And you know, I'm glad. I was in withdrawals 9 hours ago. 8 hours ago, I was high, and I didn't feel any better. Sure, the awfulness of withdrawal was gone, but it wasn't worth it anymore. This feeling isn't worth what I've put my mum through,  it's not worth what I'm doing to myself and the ones I love.

This sub, this community is amazing. It's helped me through some dark times, and I hope it continues to be a refuge from the judgment people feed themselves with. Not because criticism can't be a good thing. But because it's much easier to feed one's ego by disguising your bite as criticism.

Not all people of course, and the advice and ""real talk"" I've seen here often comes through my screen as compassionate advice encased in hard cold reality, but with no hint of a gluttonous ego to be fed. That's rare, and I think it's why I like this place so much. I hope if I succeed in getting sober I can be strong enough to continue to come here.

I'd like to say thanks. To the mods, to the people who come here not looking for their ego to be fed. I'm not that well known here, I don't post all that often, but this place has been more important to my wellbeing than is probably healthy.

Not too sure why I wrote this, I guess there's no real point. Just feeeeeelings.

*edit: Holy shit I can ramble when I'm high. No time refunds.*

**edit: Thanks for all the supportive replies. This is why this place is so great. Even so, talk is cheap right? I read somewhere that telling people about a positive change that you're planning and receiving praise for planning the change can make you less likely to make the change. Instant gratification, right? Basically, I don't deserve to feel good about myself yet, gotta actually make the changes I know I have to! Even so, all the support is helpful, thank you :)**",1484284810.0

Sometimes he takes forever to answer his phone and sometimes he nods off midway through weighing out our piece etc, typical shit, but overall he's a not a bad guy at all. He's just a little more on the dumb side than he is on the shady side, IMO.

Anyway, My IV tar habit stretches back to the 1990s but only recently have I started to hear about this fentanyl stuff so I don't know if I was just oblivious or if it's a somewhat new med, but nevertheless I have never had a chance to try it until about three months ago Judd bought a little baggie full of it and offered me a foil hit of it. 

Of course in my head I was thinking that I wanted to shoot the stuff, I never smoke dope. But Judd insisted that I would OD if I shot even just a couple points. I have seen him nodding hard many a time from doing nothing but smoking the fent. I have seen other people passed out flat on their faces, supposedly from the fent. Basically I have been told it is well worth the price, an extremely outrageous $50 per point!!!! (FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK THAT) 

Of course, a couple times when offered when I HAVE tried smoking 4 or 5 big tokes of fent off some foil--even holding it in despite being warned not to) And I didn't really feel a single thing. Maybe it was my tolerance, I don't know.

Well anyway Judd was out of tar today and not getting any more for a bit but he had some of the fent still and my So and I were feeling like we were close to going into withdrawals so we bought some. He warned us not to shoot it.

But I did. Shot 1 point. And nothing. Didn't feel it in the slightest. Meanwhile, my girl smoked hers on foil and next thing I knew she was nodding off. What the heck?

Let me just say, I know this is very likely either not really fentanyl or very very cut fentanyl, and maybe that's the entire problem. But I don't know. Why does everyone else seem like they feel it so much more than me? And what would you say is the best way to do it anyway, for anyone who has tried it in multiple ways? Anything else you think I should know?

Just curious what anyone else thinks? (I might learn something so please feel free to go off on any tangents that come to your mind!)

I kind of wanted to share my experience bc this was the easiest kick I've ever done. So Sunday I took my last dose of Oxy, woke up Monday morning went to work. Around 12pm I took either .5g or 1gram of Kratom (can't remember) via capsule. Then around 4:30pm I induced .5mg of Sub then 45min later another .5mg for a total of 1mg. I also had taken around 20mg of Adderal through out the day. I always take 10mg when I get to work around 11am. The subs had me feeling just fine till about 10:30pm when I climbed into bed and then the lovely RLS kicked in. I took 20mg Valium and 300mg gabapentin but to no avail I couldn't fall asleep (no surprise). I finally caved and took ONE 50mg tramadol. This eventually calmed my RLS and I fell asleep till early the next morning. 

After waking up I went to work, took my addy, some L-tyrosine, 5-HTP, and 1 gram of Kratom. All in all the day was not that bad. I left work around 7pm. Got home ate a lean dinner and took a longgg shower/bath. Hopped into bed and took 300-600mg of gabapentin (ended up giving me a terrible headache) and maybe .5g Kratom (can't remember) after tossing and turning till 12:30 I gave in and took ONE 50mg tramadol. 

I woke up around 6:30 and That's when the stomach issues kicked in (who knew those colors could come out of ones body). I Was able to get some lope later that day but my stomach was so jacked up i called out of work. Other then my stomach and the general malaise it wasn't a bad day as I would have thought. I spent about 20 minutes in a hot tub and immediately passed out after getting out with no RLS.  I didn't take anything during the day and felt relatively okay and actually was able to sleep here and there. 

That night I went to sleep with just some Advil PM and was able to sleep till 9am. I did wake up at 4am though and took a bath due to my stomach hurting but was able to fall back asleep after getting back in bed. The RLS was almost non existent to my surprise.  I could not believe this.. night 3 and no RLS.. yes! 

The next morning I woke up and my stomach felt like I had a handful of lug nuts in it which was very painful. I Took a shower and eventually worked up some energy to get dressed and head to work. I took some addy upon arriving and ate half an apple. My stomach was still not happy with me, But it eventually settled down. Other then the Stomach, some ripples Of goose bumps, and the sweaty/stinky armpits through out the day these were my only symptoms. 

This has been the easiest kick so far. Now
I just need to stay on top of the mental aspects. I now completely believe that it's beneficial to take a small dose of a very weak opiate before bed so you can get sleep and let your brain heal. If you think about it Most WD scenarios the individual doesn't start to really feel better till they get at least 4-5 hours of sleep, and I truly believe that's bc the brain hasn't had a chance to heal itself till one gets some solid sleep. It's proven that our brains do most of its healing and ""house keeping"" when we sleep. And for the record I had ample suboxone I just didn't think it ever got bad enough to the point where I needed more 

TLDR:
Long story short I am now a full believer that taking a little bit of some type of weak opiate to allow one to sleep is very important. It's been scientifically proven that when we sleep this is when our brains heal. If we're taking a lower dose of a lower strength opiate why wouldn't it make sense that our brains were healing..? I think the only reason why I had the self control to do this is bc I hate tramadol and it kind of scares me. I refuse to take more than 1 at a time. ",1484269690.0

5nmraj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5nmraj/quitting_with_methadone/,3,https://redd.it/5nmraj,Takemeawayplzandthx,Quitting with methadone,"I used for a year, had some small breaks. Things were mostly fine when I used once every couple weeks. There was a time when I only use once or twice a month and it was a fun exciting thing to do. But I got wired and quit, got wired and quit. I find I end up using because I binged for a week or two and then I'm too afraid of withdrawals to quit so I keep going. I tried to cold turkey after four straight months and even though the withdrawals were mild, I failed. I had the worst RLS and insomnia and my blood pressure was so high, when I closed my eyes it was like I was in a bright room with white lights. I made it to 96 hrs after last use and stupidly copped dope and used for another week. The relief from snorting a tiny line was amazing.

Anyways I have 30mg of methadone per day for the first three days, then I skip every other day and drop 5mg each time so I'm done by the end of two weeks. I had my first dose today and it got me unsick. I don't have that raw bottomless pit and painful memories feeling but I don't feel amazing. It's 2 hrs since I took the methadone liquid, is it peaked by now? I really hope it helps me sleep because I am not looking forward to repeating that insomnia. I'm really afraid that once I start dropping the methadone for the taper that I will not sleep anymore, which is the worst. It makes facing the days sober so much harder, it hurts my mental well being being sleep deprived moreso than most people-- I just can't handle it combined with my chronic pain issues.

Truthfully I still want to use occasionally like i did before. I know a person who got clean and then started LDN and is able to use without getting dependent although I'm suspicious of that claim. 

It sucks not having my little dose of mental and physical comfort. I have some mental issues that I used the drugs to hide from, it's tough to face them without any substance to back me up.

The thing that really bugs me is so normal walkin clinic doctor would help. I had to go to a specific drug addiction clinic that is privately run to get help. All I needed was some methadone or suboxone and I kept using for months longer than I really wanted to because of being turned away from other normal clinics. With how many ppl are dying of fentanyl I'm surprised the doctors were so unwilling to help. The doctor I had today was really mice and didn't give me any trouble or hassle, they just wrote me a weeks worth of methadone and told me to come back to see how I'm doing and to make sure the dose drops are working ok. I wanted to take subs but I didn't want to wait until I was sick, I've never used them before so I'm not sure if I was sick enough by 24hrs. I had done a methadone taper last year and it worked well. I still felt like shit weeks after stopping but I hope taking anabolic steroids and microdose LSD can help me push through the early months of PAWS. I'm also looking forward to low dose naltrexone usage. I'm told it helps people feel better faster in recovery. I plan to keep exercising regularly, I hope the endorphin rush from lifting and running comes back. I was supposed to go to Southeast Asia to train at fight camp which got put on backburner when I spent that money on heroin, so I hope having that goal to work for keeps me straight. It hurts to think about how much I've held myself back. My memories are nearly physically painful sometimes, the nostalgia actually hurts, I don't know how to describe it. I stubbed my toe yesterayvand it hurt so bad I can't even begin. I hope I don't take too long to get better, as I've been on and off using for a few years, only last two I have been addicted with short break of sobriety. Longest I've had is a month and I can't say I was feeling good by then, so I guess I'll push for at least three. If I can go overseas, it would help.

This was a long time ago. I wasn't abusing anything but weed, and it could be argued I don't abuse anything else nowadays, but I take a lot of Kratom most days. But that's another story.  
   
So I was 18, chronic pain and all that with little improvement from a lot of different meds. So pain doctor scripted hydro 7.5/acetaminophen 325. I took the pills every day as written but threw up almost every single time within 20 minutes. The pills I didn't throw up got me so shaky and sick and withdrawn that I just hated every second of it. The nausea was my biggest complaint   
  
So a month of constant vomiting later my doc had the bright idea to give me a 25ug fentanyl patch. Now in retrospect he's a fucking idiot. He knew I couldn't keep down a single pill and was essentially opiate naive. I was also barely 100 pounds.  
He should've given me the 12.5 patch, which was available at this time.   
   
So I put the patch on before bed and went to sleep.   
   
Woke up cold and shaking and vomited everywhere immediately. All over myself and my bed and couldn't stop throwing up. I didn't take the patch off immediately.    
    
My mother who is a pain patient herself and never had any of these issues despite being on scripted pills basically her entire life just told me to stop vomiting any that I'm overreacting.  
    
She gave me liquid nausea meds which I immediately threw up as soon as I swallowed. I tried to drink water but couldn't keep anything down. I was so cold I couldn't stop shivering
My lips were turning blue but I was totally conscious, I vomited consistently and couldn't keep anything down. I took the patch off a few hours later and was back to normal by dinner, but it was a really scary experience. What if I didn't wake up? Could I have died?    
   
My question is how close was I to ODing? I've read a lot about opiates and I know there are a lot of factors which affect whether someone overdoses. I even read that story about the guy who ordered a dent analog and accidentally doses himself just by handling it and fought the overdose and didn't pass out. I'm just wondering how close I was because my mom fucking brushes it off every time I bring it up.   
   
Side note: she's 100℅ addicted to her pills and goes to great lengths to get them. She was taking my script when I decreased in dose after she coached me how not to get the doc to decrease the script, and still tells me to go back to the pain doc even though I hated being on those pills because all she can get is tramadol. Very fucking difficult to grow up knowing your mother is taking the dogs pills thoughtlessly and running overseas to grab codeine twice a year.  
Kinda terrified seeing her because I don't want to end up like her and I'm so fucking young to be on these meds",1484249695.0

However, I went to meet a friend I haven't seen in years. In an area I used to be known. That was around 1 p.m., and I was there until 7, the first time. We were at some shit bar.

I am off probation, and was waiting on a bus when a few cop cars, and a K9 SUV roll up. I resign myself to a night in county, as I reek of cheap booze at this point, even though I'm not holding. Uh oh, flicked my cigarette, too.

So, I'm standing there, waiting on the inevitable asskicking, when they decide to be civil; thank you random assholes that record everything... I know I cannot do shit, and that I have nothing on me; I consent to a search, as I watch the bus I was waiting on drive by. Well, I'm hungry, so I'm just looking forward to my sandwich, honestly.

I am handcuffed, sitting in the back of this SUV, when I ask why I am being arrested. I am not nearly drunk enough, I'm not holding, but I have been drinking... They have no response. I tell them they can drop me off right here, the bar I was at earlier. They do, and at this point I assume I'm dreaming.

Apparently they received a call, blah, blah, fucking blah. Apparently I could have been a person of interest, but they wouldn't say for what. So, it's 8, and I'm back at the bar...

Hop the next bus, pass out, and wake up at the end of the line, at 10. Two hours later, I've walked home. Thank God the bar by my apartment was still open.

I talked to a friend, and apparently some white boy that shaves his head robbed a gas station last night; bus stop is a block away, and I look like that. Still drinking, as I assume when I wake up I'll be in county.

Not a great story, but I'm still grinning over it.",1484245485.0

Having a rough day. Just going to type away. Feel free to read it or not.

I don't come here all that frequently, but today I truly want to do dope. I haven't done dope in years, and I haven't done pills in a long time either. I take kratom everyday, and have for about two years or so. It's not just a maintenance though. It also helps my social anxiety, and I don't get panic attacks at all anymore which is nice. 

That said, I woke up today and it is exactly the sort of day that dope would be enjoyable on (aren't they all though?). The weather is nice, I have some starbucks coffee, and I just completed my synthesizer collection. Perfect. 

The only reason I haven't done dope, is because I do not want to end up with fentanyl. I'm also fairly certain even if I limited myself to once a year, my girlfriend would end up leaving (which would destroy my life). Been with her for far longer than I was with opiates.

 I live an hour out of Baltimore. Unfortunately the town I live in is very small, saturated with bored and generally inconsistent police officers (sometimes they're really awesome people that I would definitely chill with, sometimes they confiscate and smoke your weed right there, other times they call a k9 unit ""because you look suspicious"" when you came out of the store with shopping bags). 

The other unfortunate (but fortunate?) aspect of living in this area, is that the dope is at least twice the price of Baltimore. I'm talking 20 bucks for a single cap of scramble or 40 for raw. Even the long time dope heads around here pay absurd prices. The benefit of course is not having to cop in the hood or drive a long way. 

Then it gets worse. The dope is always cut with something. Back in the day it was usually just quinine or benadryl, and was morphine based. But nowadays? Not so much. Friend of a friend ended up having a seizure and dying, because he IV'd some scramble that was cut with flour. He couldn't make it to the hospital in time. I didn't even know it was possible to die from flour...but I guess it can't dissolve and he shot it anyways. 

Most of the people I knew who used to do dope here, either stopped completely, use methadone, or suboxone, or have become extreme xanax addicts. 

I don't know if I'll still be ""mostly clean"" in a month, a year, 5 years, or tomorrow. But I can say that I am ""mostly clean"" today. 

Mostly clean, because I have used opiates here and there every few months for actual pain, and because I take kratom everyday.


Altogether--this is why I stopped.",1484242910.0

5nwlkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5nwlkv/crazy_fucking_month/,20,https://redd.it/5nwlkv,bleezpassthavibes,Crazy fucking month.,"To start, I found my step dad dead Jan 2nd. He had shot himself in the head. I was only visiting my family for a few days and due to leave that next morning. Instead I came home after only talking to him 30 mins prior and found him at the dining room table. Blood hadn't even started to coagulate, because after the EMT, cops, ME and everyone left I cleaned up the mess because I couldn't let my mom do it. I cod barely make the phone call telling her she needed to come home and something was wrong.

I relapsed that night after 3 weeks sober. 

Haven't been able to go back and stay at that house, I've been in a hotel every night sense and about to have to make the trip back home.

But aside from the entire family thinking it's my fault somehow in someway, I'm deep in a binge. Almost OD'd the night before last and now about a few shots shy of full blown dopesick. Takes about .5-.8 for me to feel anything.

I've got a warrant now, had to sit in holding for a couple days already. Got pulled over again the other day and just fuuuuck. I hadn't had a ticket or court issues in years, and now I'm fucked legally. Live out of state but not supposed to leave said state I'm in trouble in. And all along this all feels likr some shitty ass dream. I'm just fucking up, and the only things left to fuck off is school and my living situation. I can't let that happen. Everyone is so fucking pissed off at me or wants answers to things I can't answer, just stupid shit along with blaming me for everything that goes wrong.

Sorry for the vent. My phone is currently off and some people l know who have been trying to reach me also get on here and at least get an explanation as to what's up/where I've been.

I keep finding myself wishing it would have been me instead of him. I was already gone and apparently not the person people want me to be when it comes to making them feel better or trying to fix things.

Anyways... two bars, a couple valium, a decent wash shot from some left over cottons and chewing on a bupe patch and I might be able to chill out until the am.

Coming into my shift I got my paycheck (more like my envelope of cash) I saw that I had worked over 40 hours the past week so right off the bat I was stoked, only 10 hours to go til I can score.

The day at work was steady, helping time go by, plus the cook had his buddy drop off some weed so we were going out and blazing it whenever we had a lull.

My shift comes to an end and I get the OK to roll through.

Its about a 45 minute commute to score, pretty much all highway till the last couple miles.

Upon exiting the freeway and merging onto the street I come to a  stoplight. At a full stop im waiting to make a right at a red light, I see my opportunity and begin to gun it.

*Thump*

Asian dude on my hood.

FUCK

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

Despite the incredulous looks painted on the faces of his friends the dude shoots me a thumbs up.

At this point im in shock, I have nothing incriminating in the car, Im not even stoned, but my heart is racing and my composure is slipping. I pull over, get out and walk towards the guy repeating myself over and over, 

""Im so sorry! Are you ok? Are you sure?! Im so sorry!""

Again the guy is cool as could be, joking and saying,

""Its cool man, just remember to look left *AND* right""

I get back in my car, go on my way and score my ball, all the while thinking to myself,

""That was my one. Everybody gets one and that was mine.""

Even now I cant believe that he didn't get hurt, or throw a fit and want to exchange information, or that a fucking cop didn't see it, or even that he was the one I hit, as the others were girls and a bro looking guy.

It was late and didnt pick em up planning to grab them yesterday morning and he apparently ""forgot"" he left them in his car his wife took and wasnt gonna be back for a few days.

So yesterday when i found out i was super pissed and disappointed..thoughts racing thru my mind lime wtf...did he jack me amd take em and made up a ridiculous story i wouldnt be able to call him out on???  I was just thinking the whole story was sketchy af.  And being tje addict he is lately hes been acting super ""all over the place"" with what hes been doing and saying.  

I just was like as long aa i get my shit idc but yesterday was fucked up.  Anyways he brings me a sub pill (ive never taken it) and says itll help since i didnt have any oxy.  So i take it last night and some this morning id say around 1.5mg each dose and it really helped and got me thru the whole day today.  So that was chill but still wasnt certain it was more of a pity hookup than a repayment for the loss cuz i still think he kept the blues.

I have really gotten my oxy dose pretty low compared to what i used to take lets say about 150/200mg per day to 60mg a day and even without my normal dose yesterday i wasnt dying without the oxy but fuck it makes work way better.  So i took some my last bit early yesterday morning so had to wait tillaat night for the sub and it really helped.

So the whole point of this post is that i owe my dude $25 from something we agreed upon early in the week and he actually got his script today for op80s and owed me a few from something else agreed upon(yes this is a mess and he barely remebers anything bc of his hectic all over the place life atm) that he said i can pick up today.  With his scrpt hes usually cool andll front me a few but this time hes like oh nah man i need the cash to payoff a debt i have and blah blah and we were going back and forth and just finally settled on me getting what was owed and giving him the 25.  

So all the while the whole week bear in mind i get screwed for what i was expecting plus early in the week i bought 5 blues and he gave me 4 cuz he needed one and thats why i was getting the shit today.  So im being the cool guy and getting fucked for it.  We were friends first so i let some shit slide.

Well when i pickup the op's today dudes so scatter brained he forgot to ask and i forgot to giv him the 25.  I was like 20 mins away when he texted me and i was like shit sorry.  Then he got all bitchy and shit and i was all fuck this and didnt reply to him after.  So when he asks again i was thinking to say ""oh shit i left the money out and my wife"" spent it.  Lol as a joke cuz of his crazy story he told me.  So that was nice today.

Tl;dr karma rears its head on my boy for his junky antics.  My boy said he lost 30s i was owed by saying some crazy story and when i forgot to pay him he got all pissy with me now ima make up a story how the money i owe him is gone with of course a crazy story as payback.",1484376262.0

My fiancé knows of my use and isn' t accepting but also understands because she's dealt with other people close to her with addiction issues. This is tough because I do love her and want to make it right but I blew my last chance at a clean life with her. So now I'm in the middle of a cold winter in New England  living out of my car. Yay.

I am fairly experienced in volumetric dosing. I've been making Etizolam/Ethanol solution for around a year and was making U-47700 solution until I could not get my hands on the compound any more. 

Recently I recieved 100mg of Fentanyl powder. I want to take every precaution I can *if* I even decide to use it. I already recently bought a good respirator (one of the $40 paint sprayer ones with replaceable filters), chemical supply goggles, nitrile gloves, a full-body paint suit w/ hood and footsies, and a waterproof tablecloth.

I have a few concerns. 

1. **My safety making the solution**

    I am confident in my skills to properly make this solution, using scales and graduated cylindars etc etc. However I am afraid I may accidentally come into contact or somehow inhale the fentanyl powder, which would be no-bueno. Other than using the equiptment I mentioned before, are there any further precautions I need to take to ensure my own safety? I'm planning on being in a well ventilated room, rinsing and tossing (or maybe burning?) the used table cloth, and sterilizing EVERYTHING after I finish. Is there anything I'm missing?

2. **Environmental contamination while making solution**

    I live in a house with other people. I am concerned about an unnoticable but hypothetically deadly amount of product to be lost in the environment during the process. Obviously I don't want to expose anybody else, so what precautions should I take pre and post process to ensure bystandard safety? Do I need something like a fume hood, or would scrubbing down a well ventilated room after the fact do the job well enough?

3. **Storage of prepared solution**

    I plan on having a larger volume of solution stored in addition to the small volume inside a nasal spray. How would I go about storing this solution? What precautions do I need to take to **MAKE SURE** it doesn't leak at all over time? I would hate to touch the 'sealed' container and accidentally absorb a minute amout of solution intradermally. 

4. **Real world use of nasal spray**

    In theory the spray worked fantastic with U-47700. Portable incognito dope. However, the sprayer end would occasionally sweat a little solution out after use and after a good amount of motion. This was not a problem previously, but touching that amount of fent solution would be a nightmare. How do I avoid this problem? Is there some super high quality nasal spray container I could get that would absolutely never leak/sweat?

5. **What solvent to use**

    This isn't a safety concern, just a general question. What solvent should I use for this solution? Previously, I have used 95% grain alcohol for my etizolam solutions and distilled water for my U-47700 solutions. Would distilled water be adequete? Or is there some fancy pharma-grade saline solution I should be using? 

    What about for long-long term storage? If I wanted an emergency medical stash to use 5-10 years down the road, is there a specific solvent I should be using for that? Realistically, what would the best half life I could achieve for a solution of this nature?

6. **Is nasal spray the best option?**

    A nasal spray was my first thought on how to use the fentanyl powder I have already aquired. Obviously I cannot just use the powder straight up, but making a volumetric solution seems very risky and easy to fuck up the more I look into it. I'm sure that's the only real option, but is the process actually as dangerous as I am making it out to be? Am I going a bit overboard safety-wise? 

Since I'm this hesitant, I've been considering ditching the idea of using the fentanyl at all. I have no idea how I would safely dispose of this compound without putting anybody else in danger. I definitely don't have the connections to sell this off to anybody so I doubt that option is on the table. Now that I have it, if I decide I don't want to use it I have absolutely no clue what I'm supposed to do with it. 

Any ideas, suggestions, warnings, or just general discussion would help quite a bit, as I'm completely torn on what to do with this stash right now. Thanks!

The lawsuit accused milk producers of price-fixing. Instead of taking the case to court, the milk producers settled the case for $52 million. The settlement claims farmers were prematurely killing cows in order to raise the price of dairy products. 

To be part of the settlement, you have to live in one of the 15 states and have bought a milk product (milk, half & half, cream cheese, sour cream, cottage cheese, yogurt or cream) at a grocery store or other products 

How much money you get back depends on how many people enter the pool to receive benefits. Estimates suggest individuals will receive between $45-70. 

According to the website, it's easy to claim your cash. All you have to do is go online, fill out the form, then click to submit your claim. However, even with the settlement, Smith and Tate said more needs to be done to protect dairy customers.

He experimented with everything, and especially loved blow, but whenever he'd need a break he would just stop. No problems.

I didn't even know my cousin was a dealer, even though I did blow myself.  I started buying from him, which is when he told me this story. His plug threw him a ton of dilly 12's, free. He said just get them out there, give them to people, sell them, do whatever.. just get the word out sort of. Well, my cousin did just that. But started doing some himself. It turned into a bit of a habit, and eventually someone offered him heroin. He said he'd never slam or smoke that shit, it was retarded. The guy said it could be insufflated. My cousin got curious, did a line and liked it. He never sold heroin, only bought it. His words. He'd trade his other drugs that he WAS selling, for heroin. This is where you guys came in.

He told me he was curious about heroin cause he'd been so immersed in drug culture, but heroin felt like a whole new world in his town he didn't know about. He frequented reddit, and not long after discovered /r/opiates. 

You guys are obviously a pretty positive community to be in for each other, except for when people are just starting opiates. You always say turn around before it's too late, opiates are amazing at the beginning, and that opiates stay amazing.. until they get their hooks in you. Long story short, my cousin hasn't done heroin since his first day browsing here. Reading about withdrawals, and the 'life' of an addict, scared the ever living shit out of him. His week and a half of light heroin use stopped right there.

But now it's back to drinking and blow, so the ending is somewhat bittersweet? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯",1484353692.0

...to completely destroy my *3* insane years of sobriety away with me? it'll be fun, i promise! dope, coke, benzos & booze. plus i need someone on stand by with the narcan, you know, *just in case!* cause let me tell you, that first shot... oh boy, i'm gonna make it fucking count. & there's a 90% chance it's not even gonna be real dope. it's prolly gonna be fucking fentynal. but hey, fuck it, right? if i'm gonna do it, i might as well do it right and go all-fucking-out. i always said that if i start using **ever** again... that it *will* kill me. no ""maybe,"" no ""it might,"" no ""oh, he'll be okay,"" none of that. this shit will fucking kill me if i start using again. it might not be on the first day, the first week, or even the first month. but at *some* point, the reaper is going to come and collect what he's owed. 

__

god dammit. i'm just talking shit. a *lot* of fucking shit. because right now, fuck, for the last ~6 months all i've wanted was. fat fucking shot of some good dope. but i've been a good little boy & haven't touched dope or a rig. the only thing i've done is a bunch of benzos. mainly klonopin but some xanax too. but i still crave that fucking shot. that taste in the back of my throat, that completely numb state of being. & i really don't give a fuck about the physical pain. i want to be completely and totally emotionally numb. 

__

i'm just so fucking depressed and in *i don't give a fuck* mode, which for me, is a very dangerous place to be. there's just so much shit that has gone on over the last 1.5 years that has literally broken me. & you guys are the first and really only ones i've even said a word about it to. i tried to talk to my psych, but she was being a cunt to me so i just fucking walked out. i don't know what to fucking do anymore. & the fact that i lost my job last month, because i had to sit 30 days in county, & working was helping me keep my head on straight because it kept me occupied and focused for 10-14 hours a day. plus i was making awesome money too. so i lost that job, & i started a new job today, taking a damn near $18/hour pay cut... but fuck it, my kids gotta eat & daddy has to provide. once spring rolls around i can get back into concrete. but for right now? well right now i'm **fucked**. 

__

& the reason i've been thinking about relapsing so much, & especially this month/right now... is that because i lost my job, i won't be able to afford to go to my sub doctor & get my Rx filled. not unless i can magically pull $165/$170 out of my ass by tuesday & i realistically don't see that happening. & it fucking blows because there's nobody i know that'll even let me borrow the money until i get my first check. why? because they're as broke as i am, or they don't trust me to spend it on what i say i'm spending it on. that's my own fault though. fuck, every bad thing that has happened over the last 1.5 years has been **my** fucking fault. everything excluding a few deaths. fuck man. someone wanna let me borrow the money until i get my first check? *lol.*

__

anyways, i'm sorry y'all. i'm sorry i just completely unloaded on y'all with this bullshit. there's someone i was talking to last night that would've let me open up & vent to them, but they have their own struggle going on right now. *you know who you are. <3* i'm not really going to relapse. i don't think. but the thought is really fucking nice. if i didn't have my son... i think i would've already hit the ground running. but i haven't. i can't do that to him. he doesn't deserve all of the bullshit that comes along with being a dope fiend. 

__

fuck. i'm sorry y'all. i'm sorry for writing a novel. if you actually read all of this... i love you & thank you. 

...

**TL:DR:** im completely broken & really want to throw away 3 years of sobriety to just completely emotionally numb myself. but i can't make my son suffer like that. because he's everything to me & i refuse to hurt him again. i'm just fucking beaten, broken, lost, confused & im this close to throwing in the towel on life.

I'm an addict.,"When I first started using pills I told myself I would use every week to keep tolerance at bay. Every week turned into every couple days which turned into everyday. 

Now I'm at the point where my tolerance is so high it's like I can't even afford to catch a nod and I'm scared to even do that many pills at once. If anything the high is just teasing me. 

I recently tried to take a tolerance break( tolerance is still super high) so it's not like I need pills to stay out of withdrawal. But I want to keep taking them just because. 

I keep rationalizing my use. Like I'll find little ways to save cash and use the money to buy pills instead. Every time I hangout with a girl I like to take pills cuz it makes me feel more suave. Gets expensive quick. Especially when you're At the point where you can't even feel the pills. 

I know I should just stop but I don't want to. Even typing this makes me want to go do some extreme shit just to catch a nod. 

I think I might join the military

But now that I've got a bigger tolerance and using a better opiate, I'm not so sure about it anymore, it just seems to taint the opiate high and takes away from the nod if anything.

My thought was that since benzos potentiate a nod because it's downer on downer (in a safe way), I thought since alcohol is basically a downer as well it would result in the same effects...

I miss the satisfaction of getting a ""good night's sleep."" I feel for everyone in withdrawal right now. I feel for everyone who's waiting on that call or that text and for everyone waiting to get into their clinic to get that refill.

I have had scripts on and off for a decade and a half and there are times I had to turn to street methods. I know exactly how pissed and let-down you are when a hoped-for confirmation from your guy (or girl) ends up being a well-intentioned text or call from a friend or family member instead. I also know how disappointed you are with yourself when you've finally made it past withdrawals and then the person whose number you should have deleted offers you a deal that's too good to pass up.
 
I am only prescribed 30mg oxycodone/apap a day (10/3x) and yet I still wake up with the yawns/runny nose/stomach cramps/no energy and all-over feeling of being run over by a truck. Not to mention the intense neck, shoulder and back pain from my herniated cervical and lumbar discs, or the stabbing at my lady parts from interstitial cystitis or the piercing, itching HELL of my skin disorder...

Today is my pain clinic appointment and I'm going to stress to them how helpful it would be to have one of my 3 doses be from a controlled med so I don't wake up in agony tossing and turning. I am however grateful every day that I DO have that prescribed amount of relief and I think of all of you that have to scrape together couch change just to make it through the day (or half of it.)

We may not always see eye-to-eye on everything, but I will always feel like this is my true Reddit home. I love each and every one of you. Here's to the weekend and feeling a part of something so beautiful and intensely blissful at times and yet so ugly and lonely at others.",1484329466.0

I didn't have a way out there so he had his homegirl come pick me up. I didn't know the girl, but we had a ton of mutual friends and she seemed chill.


We drove out to meet my boy and when we finally got there he has us sitting and waiting in a sketchy area for fuckin ever.  Homegirl and I are making small talk and she mentions that our d boy had jacked her for $80 the last time she'd seen him and that he was supposed to be making it right this time. She said they had been good friends before that, and I have  known him about 6 years now. I was worried she would jack me somehow or ditch me in the city when I got out of the car because I had to piss and wanted to grab some food at the gas station, but it wasn't her I needed to worry about. 


Well we were waiting and waiting, and then my dude texts to go to a different spot, so we went to go get gas while we waited on him. She borrows my phone and called another friend of hers back in our town and finds out that this other guy has enough black for us to buy if we want. She tells me we can either go to her guy back home or wait for my dude still. Then she got all quiet and I ask her what was wrong. She said she needed to be honest, then told me my dude had been talking about pinching my sack and giving it to her to help repay what he stole from her the last time, and that he was even saying he might just burn me for all my money and take off when I handed him my cash.  Her boyfriend,  who had been asleep in the back seat the whole ride, backs her story up. Magically, my dude starts blowing up my phone saying he was on his way walking to meet us, I kept ignoring his calls and said fuck it,  let's go back home and go through her dude.


She said I could go ahead and tell my dude that she told me what he was planning to do, so I tell him fuck him for trying to rob what used to be a friend of his, and that I Dont want shit to do with his punk ass and that I didn't want him to hit me up ever again. 


Homegirl stopped so I could get my Munchies at a 711, didn't ditch me like I thought she would (I had put $30 in her gas tank while we were waiting for dude to head our way), then drove another hour back home. She took me to her and her mans apartment,  had me come inside,  smoked a bowl of shard with me, then went out to get our sacks while I chilled in their living room. She came back after just five minutes with a way fat sack of black, and let me do a shot,  which I did IM, then we kicked back and talked while I waited for it to hit me. Shit is fire AF too! After finding out that both of us work with dogs (she is a dog sitter, I've been training dogs for almost 16 years), she offered to give my info to any current or future clients who need their dogs trained,  and I gave her the link to this subreddit, promising that you guys would amaze her with how close knit and friendly our community is, and then we both offered to help one another any time.  Then she had her man drop me off home.


Now Im posted up in Nodsville, feeling like a million bucks. I can get high all day today and then I have to go back to just smoking my herb while I wait to get my Vivitrol shot this Friday.  I peed in a water bottle before using so I have clean piss just in case, but I think the H should be out of my system by then. 


I know it doesn't sound like much, but the fact that homegirl didn't ditch me at the gas station an hour from home,  told me about my dealer and our mutual friends shady ass plan to burn me, stopped to get me food, brought me into her home and letting me do a shot comfortably and bringing me a fat ass sack without trying to get me to give her my cash first (she let my shot kick in before I decided if I wanted to buy or not), then giving me a ride home and potentially helping me find work, and all without ever having met me before. .. Well, I was kind of touched.  Years in the game have left me about to give up on humanity. Its great to know that there are still kind and considerate people out there, especially in the dope game.



All in all, it was a good night and Im very happy right now. I hope everyone is having a good night and great weekend.  Ill post some pics of the dope here in a bit. Love ya, fam!",1484480818.0

His doctor's is far away but not too far (14 blocks) so I tell his lazy ass ""WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT FOLLOW MY LEAD"" and we start running... he's slacking because of his laziness and he smokes, I have the endurance of a horse. We make it there by 5:00pm (the doctor leaves at this time) and he missed his appointment. So we head to my grandmoms for a few minutes to let her know I got my food stamps on, left, and got home around 6:00pm.. a few hours go by, just sitting around play game, bullshitting around, he leaves around 9:00pm, I head to my *other* grandmothers to chill there and I forgot my charger there from the previous day I believe, I get that and I still for a little bit.

My gay friend calls me (I am straight), but I think he's a great guy; I don't discriminate and I'm open and honest about how I feel with this guy. So I popped another 2mg Klonopin before I got in his car for the hell of it, and we go driving around all night basically. He wanted me to get him Adderall, nobody was answering their phones, but we still drove around chilling going to all different stores all night. Now I never pull all nighters, ever, and he hasn't done an opiate in months. He was off his Suboxone for 3 days. So he's like ""let's get Perc's"" and I'm like ""I'm broke man I don't want you wasting your money"" and he tells me shut up don't insult me blah blah blah so I said okay why not... it's 6am and he's like ""you want an addy?"" I'm not a fan of stimulants at all but I said, ""sure give me a half of a 30mg (15mg I took)"".. half hour later I'm crying my eyes out venting from it.. we are still in search of Perc's and we found them by 11am... we get them, head back to his house by 12pm... (now I've been up for 26hours straight which is insane for me, but I'm handling it)... he takes 3 30mg M-Box's and 3 10/325mg Bananas, he gives me 1 30mg and 5 10/325mg bananas, I take 3 of the bananas and we're having so fun talking acting a fool, and I grow incredibly tired by 1pm, I lay down and I ask him to lay in his own bed because I didn't think it's fair for him to lay on the floor I expressed to him.. being a little dopey and a naturally loving person, I say ""it's okay if you wanna put your head on my chest brother"" because he was a bit emotional.. now I see him as my brother... and then he tries putting his leg over my legs and I tell him ""yooo I'm not too comfortable with that now."" So he stops, then he tries again squeezing my leg tight in between his and starts playing with my beard and I told him to back off with this now a little, and he starts to try to lay on top of me and I was like ""what the fuck man I says we can just chill and lay down in bed get off of me in this manner"".. so he had a mental breakdown because I apparently lead him on (after expressing my views on our friendship, our boundaries, etc..) I wake up out of my nod crying because I thought he was a good friend and he tells me to get out and leave and all this shit and I told him he's selfish for not respecting that I don't want to kiss him touch his dick and the whole 9 yards.. I don't want to experiment ""how do you know you're not gay, you're just too embarrassed to admit it"" and I tell the dude that I'm not sexually attracted to men at all and this is like borderline rape trying to make me do sexual acts with him.. so I fucking left, it was 2pm, went home in such disgust that a 40 year old man would even try this.. fell asleep by 2:30pm, woke up at like 4:00am this morning (~13 hours of sleep with some tossing and turning).. terrible, frightening and disgusting experience..

TL;DR: had a productive day on 2mg Klonopin + 4 5/325mg Vicodin two days ago, by night time, popped another 2mg Klonopin, hung out with my gay friend (I'm straight and 18 years old, he's 40), pulled an all nighter to hang out with him (I never pull all nighters), I take 15mg of Adderall he gives me (I hate addies), he buys a bunch percocet, we go back to his house, laid in bed casually as friends, he tries to take a step further and get touchy and sexual, I tell him no multiple times, give him a breakdown of our friendship, he has a mental breakdown, I leave in disgust and finally go to sleep from after being up for about 26 hours... woke up at 4am this morning, got 13 hours of sleep.",1484477115.0

This is my first post ever on this forum, im more of the lurker type. :) A wallflower, even on the internet. I have been skimming through bluelight, drugs forum and this place for quite some time though. I am not good at expressing myself, so this will be quite rambly. Please bear with me.

I think i should give you my history of drug use before i ask you my questions.
I have been using opiates/opioids for about 6-7 years, i am now 23 years old. For the first 4 years, i drank poppy tea aprroximately 3-4 times a month, maybe more. With occasional tramadol, codeine and buprenorphine use. I have never, until recently, used opiates for no longer than 1-2 weeks at a time. And most of the times i just used 1-3 days in a row. (Still got sick for 3-5 days, is my body sensitive or is that normal?) 
A constant cycle of using for a while and then trying my hardest to quit, hating myself for failing once again. Starting to crave for another ""hit"" right after the withdrawals subsided. 
A few months ago i got sick and tired of being in the limbo of tranquility and agony. 
For the past 4 months, i have been using buprenorphine (nasally), Clonazepam and tramadol ""medicinally"". Occasionally indulging myself with poppy pod/seed tea, heroin or oxycodone for recreaction. Okay, ill have to admit that sometimes i snort 2-3mg of subutex to get a nod on.
It has been wonderful to be able to sleep, eat, have energy to do things and basically to function ""normally"". 
Although how wonderful it has been, there have been downsides too. I have to buy my drugs from ""the streets"", so they cost a lot of money. Which i cannot afford. Also the longer i keep using, i think the harder it is to recover. My girlfriend isnt really of fond of me nodding out half the time, and im using also quite abit of her money to support my drug habit. Sometimes i cannot understand why she still loves and sticks with me, even though i constantly tell her she should just leave me.
I am also an alcoholic (drink 2-3times a week), a benzodiazepine addict (1mg clonazepam/day + random amounts of xanax when theyre available) and smoke 0,5-1,5g of cannabis a day. Girlfriend smokes too.

So now that i think i have told you what you need to know about my history with drugs, i can proceed to my questions.

I have a strong need to hear success stories from people, who have found happiness from life after drugs. I am so tired of living this shadow version of myself, that the drugs have shaped me into. I would like to stop using drugs (except for the occasional marijuana and alcohol). But i am scared that life can never be the same as before. Can my brain chemistry heal back to normal? Will my life be a constant struggle for the rest of my days?

There is also this question: How to fill the void, created by removing yourself from the ""drug world"". I mean all the time you spend thinking about them, the time you use to get them and of course the time you spend getting high on them. All of those things basically form most of my life, from apart the mandatory stuff i need to do to stay alive. To leave these drugs could in my opinion be compared to breaking up with someone you love, in some ways.

Ugh, im quite the rambler so i will try to squeeze this in a nutshell;

Can life truly be happy after long use of drugs? If so, how to achieve that?
Does the brain ever heal from the damage opiates have caused it?
Am i going to struggle for the rest of my life? (more than the ""average person"")

For if i am, would it really be that bad to spend the rest of my life using, if i could find a way to support such a habit?

I probably will not answer any posts on this thread, if there will be any. Im so high on oxycontin which gave me the confidence to write this post, which does not happen often.
But i shall be lurking, please help me!

5o2hyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5o2hyb/does_tapering_off_dope_with_methadone_work/,4,https://redd.it/5o2hyb,Cloudnff7,DOES TAPERING off dope with methadone work?,"I stopped a six month habit of heroin/fent mix cold turkey and only made it to day five of withdrawal and relapsed for six days. I couldn't handle the lack of sleep and my blood pressure was off the charts high. I managed to go exercise each day and even had a half decent workout one day but the endless shit feels overrode my desire to stay clean.

Anyways after using for six more days i took 30mg methadone 20hrs after I last used. The next day I took 30mg, and this third day I took 20mg. I plan to steadily decrease over two weeks, 20, 15, 15, 15, 10, 10, 5, 5, finished. 

So far I have been totally fine. I feel slightly shitty at moments mentally when I think about being a fucking dope fiend and it gives me panic thinking how far id let myself go, but I'm sleeping well and have a good appetite. I'm expecting to feel mostly ok until 2-3 days after I quit the methadone but I'm thinking I at least avoided acute H withdrawal and withdrawing off a two week methadone tapered habit will be far more manageable.

I can probably get a non narcotic sleep med and maybe an anti depressant from the doctor as I expect my sleep and mood to be pretty terrible when all the methadone leaves my body. I plan to start taking the opioid blocker naltrexone when I'm off the opioids completely to reinforce not using as well as to help with PAWS.

I expect to feel at least a little shitty at some point but has anyone done anything similar? I often hear of ppl doing suboxone tapers and not having to experience withdrawal except for the first 24hrs before they induct. I did a similar methadone taper before but I quickly went back to dope. This time I actually want to stay clean, and the methadone helps with cravings (haven't had any) but I DO NOT want to be dependent on the liquid cuffs or deal with the drawn out horrific withdrawal as that is the reason I relapse in the first place. I have been through WD so many times I don't have the tolerance to handle it before, I will relapse if I have to cold turkey... plus I'm just intolerant of facing WD again, I would have quit using heroin months ago if withdrawal wasn't so horrific at times.. lying in bed all night with my heart pounding kicking sheets and not being able to sleep for weeks is bad..

I'll ask for a RLS med as well just in case and maybe clonidine in a low dose. I also can't stay on methadone long because I have a heart condition and methadone can excaberate heart issues. Suboxone would have been a better med but it is double the cost and I'm petrified of PWD

Anyways wish me luck

Doing dope everyday is not fun , for me. I rarely liked doing it and it truly was just fear of withdrawal that kept me on.

They are sustained release like butrans, but only for 4 days instead of 7. I have the 35 μg/hour ones, so 5mg/day with a total of 20 mg in each patch. I am a daily opioid user for my back issues, but until recently I have only been taking tramadol and kratom regularly. A few weeks ago I got a bunch of codeine and dihydrocodeine, as well as some 10mg MS tabs and 30 mg OC tabs. (unfortunately even though I bought it in Ghana it was still the new formulation) But those are almost all gone. So usually I don't have a very high tolerance, but it probably went up a bit recently and will probably go back down. So I was wondering what dose, if any, would be nice for getting a nice buzz since bup is stronger than tramadol and kratom, plus I know people who get massive euphoria it. I would imagine putting on 1-3 would probably not give me a high due to how slow they release. Also if anyone had any experience/suggestions with getting the bup out of the patches it would be much appreciated!

Sorry for making this so long but I had another unrelated question I wanted to slip in. Is there any consensus on which way to abuse the OP's is the best? I've read about at least 5-6 ways to do it.

TL;DR: 1. I have a moderate opioid tolerance and got my hands on 5mg/day buprenorphine only patches. What dose (if any) would be good for recreation? 2. Any suggestions about how to beat the patch sustained release mechanism? 3. Is there any consensus on the best way to beat the new OCs?

About a month ago I met a guy (I'm a girl for info).  And he's perfect, just my type looks wise, successful, great in bed.  We started seeing each other, we went out a few times.  Then he invited me round to his (we'd already had sex once at this point) and the plan was that I'd stay the night.  This is where it all started to go wrong.

I should probably mention at this point that I'm a highly functioning painkiller addict.  Nobody knows.

I was really nervous about the situation, and I got a little too high and acted like an idiot.  I made myself far too much at home considering I'd only been there once before.  Everything was OK-ish though, we had sex again in the morning before I left.  But in my brain I'd fucked it up....I didn't know how to address this, so I went totally OTT and came on way too strong.  I texted him far too much....I asked him when we could do something again.....I laid my cards on the table about liking him.  In short, I've been an idiot.  

On Friday he text me and says he thinks it would be best if we were just friends.  

I'm gutted but also know it's because I came on far too strong far too soon.  I have to meet him tomorrow to get my stuff I'd left at his back.

So opiate guys and girls, how do I fix this?  How do I get a guy back when I've lost him for coming on too strong?

EDIT;  Thanks everyone for commenting.  I met him yesterday, looked hot, was cool and collected.  He asked me to go for coffee, which I did and maintained my aloofness throughout....I caught him checking me out a few times.....then right as we were leaving he said to keep in touch.....I was thinking that if he did like me too I'd most likely hear from him in the next few days....but he'd text me to say thanks for the coffee before I'd got home!

A few people I know (both of who now eat amazing diets and are highly athletic) would always say how they feel older than they are and specifically their joints and body aches all the time..... and I would always say: ""I feel great and young!"".

Both of these people used to use heroin around 8 years ago and have been clean since.

I had been using pharms for 10 years, intermittently at that time... and seriously always felt pretty good and would NEVER complain of that stuff like they did.

Well due to a lack of supply, I finally tried H for a short time.

Smoked/insufflated for 2 months, quit. Then used a few intermittent times after that (but never had withdrawals again).

Decided to just never due heroin again.

Anyway, I have had the WORST period in my life for months, ever since my first stent. I cannot stop sleeping, often 17 hours a night and even if I do wake up with alarm.... I am nodding out all day (NO opiates) tired.

My body ACHES like never before, my joints in my back, my finger joints have been killing me and I have to make sure I am careful how I sleep or they are painful. My achilles tendons are stiff now and hurt.

So, I am far from acute withdrawals. I didn't use that long... But I feel like I am suffering from what my friends complain of now.

AND they have been clean for close to a decade...

Seems so unlikely.... but I am scared. Pharms never did this to me and I have a lot of experience.

I'm from the Midwest but my parents got me to get on a plane ticket and come here (cuz they live here) to get clean but all I've been doing since I got here is trying to find a way to cop dope. Yeah the hashish is all over the place but that's about it. It's just miserable like the only thing I could maybe do is buy 10 boxes of codeine and use CWE but honestly what's the point. There's tramadol too but that stuff makes me feel funny. The only reason I haven't jumped off my roof is because I have some subs with me but those will run out eventually and all they have here is methadone. If there's methadone there's gotta be dope right? I just don't really feel comfortable as a woman asking random Nigerians on the street if they've got heroin. Ugh I don't even know. I came here to get clean but all I'm doing is counting down the days until I get back home. I dunno I just don't have anyone to talk to and it's really lonely. ):,1484426402.0

I was bad on oxy and opana for a few years and was on low dose of Suboxone/Zubsolv for about 2 years until this past Sept. I went back to doing the pills again, and also have done a little H here and there. I am at a point today of needing to transition back to my Zubsolv, but I have a couple questions. I can't afford to keep my habit, and don't want to have to transition during the work week. I have to work for a few hours tomorrow at noon. 

I had my last oxy at about 1:30 est this afternoon. So from my past experience, I expect to take a little Zub at about 3am or so. Hopefully then I can get a little sleep and be semi normal for work. I had decent luck transitioning last time and functioning the same day.

My question is, would it be worth it for me to grab some Kratom at a headshop to take between now and when I can take the Zub? Does taking the Kratom reset the clock for when I can take the Zub?

I also have some Lope, but that is about it otherwise. Any help or tips would be appreciated. Been lurking here the past couple months and have seen some great advise and support.",1484424582.0

I understand it's actually fentanyl but there are some fairly trustworthy looking vendors and I'm willing to trust the pressing being equivalent in dosage (or at least attempted to be equivalent and homogenous).

It's advertised as being able to be snorted, IV, oral, etc. but the much lower oral bioavailability of fentanyl (33%) vs oxycodone (60-80%+) would seem to make oral use less potent.

So I'm guessing the ""equivalent dosage"" is most likely for IV use, which I'm not trying to get into. The vendor (dopeboy210) says this which is a little hard to decipher but perhaps someone can help clarify...

""Oxycodone 30MG pressed with fentanyl 0.8MG which is equal 100MG OXY as active substance""

Any help that isn't ""fentanyl bad u gon die like my cousin's friend"" would be greatly appreciated. I understand the inherent risks with drugs and I'm trying to mitigate those. I'll likely end up just asking the vendor to clarify and starting off with a 1/4 pill but would appreciate input.",1484421277.0

Through the heartache I've felt for everyone dealing with crafty dboys who only worry about making money and have no respect for their fellow man, I thought of something. 

Why doesn't anyone use test kits for their dope? If someone was to suspect their bag was cut with fent or is straight fent they could test it and avoid ODing. I know no one wants to waste even a quarter of a point of dope but dying seems worse to me idk. I'm sure they make test kits strictly for H. Maybe this idea is too good to be true.

Amidst all of the negatives of dope from the physical addiction to the selfishness to the lying to the money spent, let's be really honest and admit that there is nothing in this world that feels better than opiates, and that's what I struggle with.

The only way to get clean seemingly is to replace the dope with activities that occupy time, but that's all they ever feel like, fucking snowboarding, to the gym, to painting to whatever, in the back of my mind it always feels like I'm going though the motions just to NOT go and score.

Is this just a horrific fact of life - that when a person opens that opiate box and takes a sample, you've fucked up, and only in death will that person ever really stop craving dope?

Tldr: no matter the negatives nothing in this world can beat the euphoria and pleasure of opiates - so where is the solid motivation to get clean?

I've always known he was a decent guy with fire dope but tonight he really went above and beyond for my fiancé and me. 

I've known him for a long time and used to buy pills from him frequently. He gave me some killer deals but unfortunately I built up a tolerance and even though he'd give me one hell of a deal, the pills just were not something I could afford. This is when I graduated to heroin. 

He is an older guy and he likes to know who he's selling to. Since I was bringing my fiancé to buy dope from him for the first time he had us meet him at Shari's so he could get to know my man. As we were leaving he bought us a pie to take home lol and gave us a fat sack. 

We have been going to him for about six months or so and December was a rough month for my man and I. We both were in between jobs and had zero income. After cashing out my fiancés retirement we were able to pay our January rent and keep surviving another month. We paid what bills we could and we had about $40 left which we used to buy some dope last night. 

We met our guy and he asked about our situation because we haven't been around as often. I was honest with him about our situation but told him not to worry because we both have started working this week and should be doing better soon. 

Usually $40 around here gets you .4 or .5 depending on who you're dealing with.

Our guy gave us 8 2mg Xanax bars, a gram of h, and $20 so we have gas and food money.
