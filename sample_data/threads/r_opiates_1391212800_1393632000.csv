I have little marks all over my arm from dozens of failed attempts to try and draw blood into the syringe. Other people got it in me the first time. I was a failure.

.......until 5 minutes ago that is! I watched that sweet blood fill the syringe and mix around with the semi-dark liquid happiness, loosened up the belt and pushed in. My mouth and nose filled with that odd taste/smell as my head became light and my knees wobbled. The warm blanket of success finally engulfed me. I did it!

Most of you experienced users are probably laughing at me, but this is a huge triumph. It was probably the last time I was going to attempt it before completely giving it up and HOT DAMN did it work!

I've been doing opiates for 5-7 years, started out with the usual hydrocodone / percocet (20-30mg a whack), took a break for a couple years, then found myself on Tramadol and then Poppy Seed Tea.

Most would think that tram & PST are only drugs for WD's, but I made a helluva habit out of both.  First the tram, after 18 months or so I was taking 800mg a day..   Problem was the online pharmacies would only give me 180 50mg tabs every 20 days.  I could never ration it, so the first of what I ever experienced of WD's came from Tramadol.  Worst WD's I ever had.

After so many Tram WD's I decided to find something more readily available that didn't cost $120 per script.  Some internet searching revealed poppy seed tea, and holy crap did I indulge.  I spent 2+ years of buying 50lb. bags of poppy seeds at $100 a sack... But at least the $100 would last a couple weeks.  Luckily I rented a house in the middle of nowhere; by the time I moved out, the dumped seeds I threw were growing poppies everywhere!

Now the poppy seeds are hard to find (the only local source turned to trash seeds), oxys & vics are too expensive..  How does one cope?  I've been burning half my paycheck each week buying pills (sharing with a buddy, who still owes me), but a 30mg oxy gets me off for maybe 4 hours...  Then in another 12-24 hours I'm looking for another before I feel sick.

Should I keep spending $5 per 5mg oxy only to have $30 get me through the day, or is there something better?  What's the next [cheapest] step?",1391239974.0

A sober awakening.,"Wow. It's been a hell of a ride since last summer when i couldnt find anything to save my life. I've been getting free dope, selling dope to cover what money i do spend, and otherwise juse getting really cheap good dope for about 3 months now from 3 different guys. One of them got busted back in december for driving like an idiot with an oz of dope and scales on him. That's his own dumbass fault. But today I wake up sick as fuck because I couldnt get anything last night, and my mom tells me she's got the $50 she owes me and I'm overjoyed. I have money to score so I hit up my main guy, no answer. It's kind of early in the day and he sleeps late so no worries, I'll just hit up my other guy with the more expensive, but better, stuff. HIS PHONE IS OFF. Now that raises a red flag, that has never happened in the 3+ months of me hitting him up. Come to find out after texting everyone I know trying to score (i eventually did from someone random I havent called in 3 years, and it was great dope too) that BOTH of my main dealers, who lived across town from eachother and were not connected at all, got arrested late last night. The cops kicked in their doors and took them to jail for having oz's of dope and guns. HOLY FUCK what are the odds. It's a small town and both of them sold dope out of their apartments, ppl streaming out of there all day and night so i guess the odds were actually pretty good. But here I am, no more cheap dope, no more easy scoring, no more fronts, no more selling dope and making money to cover my habit. Folks, it's been almost 4 years since I snorted my first roxy, but I think this is about as obvious of a sign as I could get that it's time to quit. My gf caught me crushing up a pill and hasnt spoken to me in almost a week (she thought I had quit months ago and i lied to her face multiple times....yeah I really fucked up), I'm broke as fuck and can't possibly support my ""need at least a half gram to avoid withdrawal for the day"" habit, and I don't even have a reliable connect anymore. I'm pretty much at square one. I bought 2 bottles of 72 ct lope today and I have $20 to try an find a sub..but i really think I just have to get serious about my life and just not do dope anymore. I won't even be tempted, i have no one to call that's reliable. I have managed to not get any kind of police record, my family has no idea I have a drug problem, and I have a good job (it pays well sometimes, but I have to make do with periods of no income, commission is a cruel mistress) and my habit has gotten so bad that it's not fun at all anymore. I'm tired of being sick every day and now that my connects are gone it's just painfully obvious that now is the time. So it all starts tomorrow. Gonna wake up sick, down 72mg of lope to start and see if it takes the edge off, and see if i can find a sub.

I've also thought about the suboxone clinic. We have one in town and I have health insurance, but my parents pay for it. Is there any chance I can get subs without paying out the ass and my parents not finding out about it? Anyway, just had to share this rant with someone. It's funny, one year ago today I lost my job that led me to having to move back in with my parents, and here i am at another crossroads in my life on the same day. I've had a decent ride with pills/dope, I've not gone to the depths of hell like many of you have, but I've stolen from my parents and pawned some shit i wish I could get back. I'm not the same person I used to be. I want to see what sober life, real sober life months after my last hit is like. I havent gone longer than 9 days sober in over 2 years. I want to make something out of myself while i still have the chance, and leave the junky part of me behind (though it will always be apart of me, I know that). To all of the people i've met here: I wish you all the very best, I love reading this sub almost every day. I dont post much anymore but back in the summer I met some really cool people as I spiraled out of control. It's hard to believe who i am now and what I've done with myself, in the last year especially. I was a 1 roxy-a-day only addict until may of last year when I tried heroin for the first time, and you know how that goes. Half gram a day now to stay well, a full gram to catch a nod. But now has to be the time. I feel like I'm lucky, ive seen 4 dealers i was close to now go to jail on big time possession charges in the last 6 months. If I keep it up, my time will be soon. So I'm really gonna try to do it. I love you all. Be sound.",1391230009.0

After wor some friends came over and we made hash and watched ""this is the end."" At about midnight (halfway through the movie) my girlfriend calls. I ignore it ellecting to call her back after the movie. She calls again, and i ignore again watching the movie. The third time she calls i just feel that it must be serious. I answer and she is crying hysterically. I didnt really make out watch she was saying but i knew i had to drive to her house, which is about 50 miles away.
 I get to her house and she is balled up on her couch crying unconsolably. I ask her whats going on because i couldnt understad her on the phone. She breaks through the tears an starts to explain what happened. Her dad was out with some of his friends and accidently stepped off the side of a verticle rocky bluff. He fell aout 15 feet headfirst onto a large rock. Instantly filling his head with liquid and causing him to be brain dead.

I've been using ""sparingly""(getting high once or twice every two weeks, but real high) since I have more big boy responsibilities now. I was craving pretty bad and didn't do any for 3 weeks, so my buddy said he could get me .2 of some fire tar and some 10mg methadones(6 exactly). I smoked the tar 2 days ago, that night took 25mg methadone, and today took another 25. He hit me up today and said he could get 4mg dillies for 5 a pop. The only reason I got the 'dones was because, well shit, I don't do opi's often, and I figured my tolerance would go back down to what it was after a couple weeks after taking these methadones. My question is, when do you think I could take the dillies(still gotta look up a dose for a medium tolerance but probably what, 8mg? 12?) and get high? I'm right in knowing that methadone increases your tolerance like crazy right?

thanks fellas!

I feel horribly guilty, because I truly thought I could do it this time.  K is doing everything he can in his power to help me, and i'm just horrified of taking advantage of that.  There's nothing more that I want right now in the world than a fucking needle in my arm, I fucking hate myself and I fucking hate heroin.



I know the only way I can stay clean is if I really fucking want it for myself. Nothing terrifies me more because I don't think I love myself enough.  I honestly feel like my only options are going back to dope or killing myself.

At least I can support myself and not have to depend on anyone.  

I'm done hurting person after person.  Most of the people I hurt have never even heard of this sub, some of them don't speak to me anymore, some are dead, so maybe it's some sort of prayer or shout out.

I'm sorry.  That really means nothing coming from me, and probably never will.  I'm sorry everyone, I know I'll never be able to express or say that enough.  Most of all i'm sorry June, I was never the big sister enough.  I love all of you.",1391198477.0

One is that you ""burn out"" your receptors permanently and that you'll need to have some sort of ""assistance"" for the rest of your life to feel normal (e.g. subs, SRIs)

The other is that given time your body will heal itself and you'll be able to be happy naturally again.

Now, I don't know which one is right and I hope to god that the first one is wrong. So I started to think even though I normally need opiates to be happy, there are times that I can be just as happy without them. 

The most compelling example is when I'm feeling TERRIBLE from withdraw and I don't have ANY opiates in my system, as soon as I get a phone call from my connect or finally scoop something up I IMMEDIATELY feel better and as if I'm on cloud nine. This is obviously before I have any opiates in my system and is almost proof in my opinion that your body can still produce the chemicals necessary to make you happy by itself.

Before I tried heroin, I had experience with other opiates. Kratom, poppy seed tea, poppy pod tea, hydrocodone and oxycodone.

Kratom was too weak and tasted gross.

Poppy seed and pod tea tasted gross and was too variable in potency.

Hydrocodone and oxycodone were great, but they were way too expensive. At least for what I could find. $1 / mg for IR oxycodone is just ridiculous.

The first time I tried heroin, I got some really high quality #4 powder. 20mg up the nose was about the same as 30mg oxycodone in the gut. Even at $300 / gram, that's still way better than $1 / mg for oxycodone.

I went from doing it once a week, slowly over time, to every day.

The weird thing is, my life isn't fucked up. I have a car, a job and am fairly healthy.

It just so happens to be that heroin is the one thing in life that I love more than anything else. I know that sounds pathetic, but I just don't care. Nothing else makes me feel better. It fixes whatever was wrong with me. I can actually be happy.

I hate that this is illegal. I've tried going on buprenorphine once, for about a month, and it actually worked okay. If it came down to it, I think I could survive with just buprenorphine. Fortunately for me, I never needed more than 2mg in a 24 hour time period. I was able to get the dosage down to 0.5mg per day. If I stopped completely, I would start getting extremely depressed and would only think about killing myself. Buprenorphine is actually quite a good antidepressant. It's worked better for that, than anything else I've ever tried.

It's more fun to be on heroin though. I like getting high. I don't IV, I just snort or plug it. I've never used needles before, and I don't think I ever will.

I'm not really sure why I'm writing this, but I can't talk about this with my family or friends because they'd fucking go crazy if I even mentioned the word heroin. I wish I had people in my life to talk to that understand how I feel.",1391322283.0

So here's the story, this kid was a hardcore opiate addict. Straight up junkie, but not a regular junkie. I can tolerate them, but a complete and utter scumbag. So he's the type who would lie and steal from his closest friends just to get a bag of dope. A good example is when a group of my friends took him to Pittsburgh for the weekend to chill with our old high school friends. My friend invites him over to stay the weekend and my other friend gives him the ride there. While they're all chilling he decides to try to steal our 'business' money. Around $3,500 in cash from my friends closet. Puts it in a sock and sticks it up his ass. Denies it the whole time until my friend frisks him finds it and punches him in the face. Needless to say I'm pretty sure he had to find an alternate ride home across PA that day. Well this kid was forced to move to California, over 2,000 miles across the country to get clean. So he's apparently 'clean' so now he puts my friends down for using opiates. Saying shit like 'YOU GOTTA GET AWAY MAN, IM A COMPLETELY BETTER PERSON THAN YOU NOW.' and all that other shit. Bragging about how hes sober. I'm glad the kid got sober but shit you definitely aren't better than us. To get sober your parents had to move you across the country and drug test you every 4 days and still do. He's always stolen from people before he had this bad habbit. He's scum. I quite shooting dope with no rehab, no Suboxone (I used one or two here and there), no shit. I did it because I wanted to. Here's the kicker, the fucker tried to buy blues off me via mail while he was behind my back bragging about how he's clean and never go back to 'that lifestyle'.

tl;dr Kid brags about being clean and better than everyone else even though it took the action of his parents moving him across the country. And before that his parents wouldn't even let this 19 year old 'man' have his own job because he'd blow it on dope and pills. But the rest of us are pieces of shit for using an oxy now and then.

Everything. 
Why do you feel this way? 
I don't know how to feel any other way. 
Is it something specific? 
Probably but I'm not sure what is is. 
What the fuck is wrong with you? 
I'm hopeless. A disappointment. 
What makes that true? 
My actions. My thoughts. My fuck ups. 
What did you fuck up? 
My life. My relationships. Everyone's faith in me. I squashed it. It's gone. I won't ever get that back so why should I try to? I mean what the fuck. This is my fate. This is my life. A drug controls me. It fucking runs my life. Even when I'm sober, my thoughts never change. 
Why don't they change? 
Not a question I can answer. 
Who the fuck are you? 
Fuck if I know. The only identity I know I've been trying to run from for the past almost 4 months. Trying to fake something I can never be. Something that will never work for me. I see it working for other people and I don't crave that life like I crave this life. I like the insanity. I'm addicted to despair, misery. It's sick. I'm a sick ass bitch. 
Do you want to be happy, christen? 
What the fuck kind of question is that? Who the fuck said I was unhappy? 
You just did. 
Oh ya. I guess I did. But there's some sort of sick enjoyment I get out of being miserable. So, to me, this is happiness. This is my bliss. I enjoy the pain. I want more. More. More. I'm addicted. 
Addicted? 
Yes addicted. 
Can you ever see yourself sober and happy? 
I can't see myself happy in a situation I'm not comfortable in. I could never be comfortable sober or ""happy"". Those who say they have such wonderful lives sober are fucking joking themselves. They miss it. The thrill. The fucked upness. If they say they don't miss the chaos I say they're full of shit. It's not all about the drug. It's about the full blown chaos. The feeling in your gut when the dealer finally shows up. The thrill when you're walking in someone's house, imagining yourself in their life. Just for a second you may feel normal but a great satisfaction comes from knowing you could never be that person. That person is the ""outsider"". I am the ""normie"". You are the one who's fucked up. Never thinking outside your box. I feel bad for you. Living day to day is a fucking gift. This drug addiction ignites a flame inside me that nothing else ever has. I know you think that's fucked up. It makes perfect sense to me. Wake up twitchy. Find a way. Steal. Rob. Sell. Cop. Shot. Repeat. I love that shit. It's been awhile. The program is ingrained inside me. They say I'm wrong. I'm an addict. I can't think for myself. My best thoughts get me high and I wonder what's so wrong with that. Maybe it didn't work for you. Maybe you're just stupid. Insanity they say. Except I don't expect anything other than misery. I know what I'm getting myself into when I cop. When I steal. 
You're talking to yourself ya know. 
So what? There's no one else to talk to. Don't interrupt me. 
Let's run away. Leave this fucking place and do whatever the fuck we want. I can make it happen. Whatever it is. If there's an opportunity I'll find the means. I'll find a way. I'm just stupid enough to do it and smart enough to make it work. 
How will you finance that choice? 
Save a few paychecks for the gas money. Wing everything else. I don't want to have a plan. There's no excitement to be had when there's a plan. Struggle. Misery. Let it find me. Feed my ""Insanity"". My addiction. 
What about probation? 
If they find me I'll do my time. It's not a lot. I won't deny they will find me eventually. I am not invincible.

**August 2012:** Spent a week in hospital in Thailand, had a private suite as a ""rich westerner"" and was treated like a queen. Got to order IV Fentanyl when ever I liked, which was generally twice a day. The feeling of going from pain to that intense nothingness was amazing, indescribable really, I frankly loved it. Slipping into that warm world of no problems and a sort of radiant beauty rushing through me sparked a desire that was not to be easily shaken. Looking back its probably a rather strong opiate to try for a first time and especially in such frequent dosages.


**January 2013:** Back home, bored, saying the weed I was smoking didnt compare is such a ridiculous understatement, I really wanted to capture that heavenly bliss I had in Thailand and so I figured I may as well just try some heroin for fun to see if it could compare. Ended up getting half a gram. Snorted said heroin and was completely underwhelmed. Had breaks of 1-3 days in-between doses. Not only did it taste horrible in my throat it was no where near the experience I had in Thailand. 

**February 2013:** After being ""let down"" by my experience with heroin and no longer buying into the propaganda that its stupidly dangerous I decided to order a gram and this time do it through IV over snorting. I had used needles before for medication(IM) and had someone shoot me up with speed in 2010 so I wasnt particually nervous about making that leap. I guess jumping from snorting to IV'ing in a month is pretty quick by most standards but I really just wanted to capture that feeling I had overseas. Ordered a box of 100 rigs, 100 30g needles and 100 alcohol swabs and injectable water for harm reduction purposes.


**Feb 2013 contd:** I found my first IV experience to be fantastic, even though I was missing 50% of time to begin with(mostly going through the vein so they were 'small misses') I entered that deep body high and began nodding on every shot. I only needed 0.05 to get a strong nod and that made my entire body sweat, I'd have to take of the majority of my clothes because I was so damn hot after a shot, so nice, so blissful, the ultimate escape without the paranoia and personality loss that came with cannabis. At this point I knew I liked it and figured since I want to keep it just to holidays I may as well just binge in the time I had off, so started shooting daily until I ran out, once a day. 


**March - Early May 2013:** Studying at university, made a promise to myself to only use on the holidays as a treat and kept to it.


**May 2013:** Yay holidays! Time to order a gram, being in Australia I was able to procurer some amazing strong SE-Asian #4 and was throwing up/blurred vision/mega high of 0.03 IV'd. It was about as close to that thailand experience as I had experienced to date. I really enjoyed it. Started shooting twice a day generally, I think there was one day I didnt use due to having to spend it with parents but besides that it was daily until I ran out. 


**June - Early August:** Back at uni, ended up getting another gram in my final week at uni in preparation for the holidays, had ran out of alcohol swabs at this point but figured it would be ok as long as I cleaned my arm with anti-bacterial soap before injection.

**Late August:** One week of holidays left and I really didnt want my recent binge to end, sold my iPad and ordered another gram and after a 5 day break from my last binge I started shooting again. Now up to 3 times a day if I could. 

**September - Late November** - Back at uni, still kept my word to myself and didnt use while studying.


**Early December:** Yay back to holiday reward time, also my biggest holiday period of the year. Got another G but this time it went a lot quicker, shooting 3 times a day and using up to 0.06 a shot now so it went a bit quicker. Started getting some noticeable scars on my arms. Started reading this sub a lot more and after seeing that most people just use tap water I stopped using sterile and boiled water and just started using the tap. 

**Mid to Late December:** Well still on holidays, got some money through some dodgy means and figured I may as well keep the party going. After a one week break I was back to shooting up to 3 times a day.


**January 2014:** Still on holidays, arm is looking a little worse for wear, the track marks are noticeable to me but im not sure if anyone else is aware/makes the connection. Had another one week break since my last binge and was struggling with boredom so got another G. Got my marks from Uni back and was stoked that I passed all my subjects and only have one year left till I have a degree! That deserves a reward in my books. 


**Late January 2014:** Shit has hit the fan. My room mates told me their moving out and that Ill need to find a new place, my best friend of a decade walked in on me giving a blowjob to her boyfriend of the last 4 years, I don't even know why it happened, well I sort of do, he took advantage of me(emotionally not in a rape way) and it was one of the biggest mistakes of my life that I regret deeply.  I don't even want to be with the guy and would do anything to get her back. Ran out of filters, started injecting without filters, as my gears asian and pretty pure (to the naked eye) it dissolves 100% in water so im not *too worried*. For the first time ever im now injecting not to just escape boredom but to escape the really shitty situation of me losing my best friend and about to be forced to move back in with my parents if I dont find a place.


**February 2014:** Ran out of needles, had to use one rig a few times until new ones arrived in the mail. Being the lazy person I am I didnt end up finding a new place. Spent the last few days moving all my shit to my parents house. Had enough for one shot and just did it here, tonight, after they went to sleep. Part of me is kind of happy not to have to pay rent/pay for food/bills at the moment but in all honesty total freedom is worth the cost of all of those so i'll no doubt be pretty bummed out tomorrow. Pretty sure ill get a gram just to make this transition into living back with the parents manageable. Losing my good friend and my apartment have me pretty down and I need something to pick me up. Being in your late twenties at home with your seriously old parents is no picnic. 


**Late February 2014:**Ended up getting that transitionary gram so I could chill out at my parents place and getting another gram tomorrow because I came into a little bit of money and am a bit depressed. Havent seen any of my close friends since January, cooped up in my parents house getting high every day, just waiting until my best friend forgives me...Started back at university, ended up getting a rig ready for my morning class, injected at the train station before my lectures for the first time. My first rule was never inject while studying but since losing my roommates and my best friend I guess I don't care as much, the ""fuck it"" attitude and all that.

1wvugd,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1wvugd/day_6/,29,https://redd.it/1wvugd,thewordtron,Day 6 -_-,"   Sometimes I wonder if It's all worth it. The life, the rush, the fall, the physical and emotional rollercoaster thats ran me through the wringer and back a hundred times. If I had a shot in front of me it would be a different story entirely. Of course it'd be worth it. A quick prick and I'm god again. No need to eat, sleep, shit, piss, love or fuck. The sweet embrace takes care of everything. All I have to do is be, and in being be content. But it's never that easy, is it?
	
   It all started back in 2009, I had my wisdom teeth removed and got a nice little bottle of OC-30's. Back then I hadn't the slightest idea of the joy contained within. I saved a few, and traded the rest for two ounces of some good skunk. Over the course of a week I took the remaining pills as directed. No stripping off the time coating, no whiffing, no shots. At the time I never dreamed I could be an IV user in the future.
	
   Fast forward a couple months later. The chick I traded my original script to noticed I had taken a liking to Oxy and always had Norco's or Percocet ready to go. I wouldn't say I had an addiction at that point, merely a habit. Using two or three days out of the week, relaxing with some weed the rest of the time. I still remember the initial love affair. Twenty milligrams and I was in heaven, nothing could stop me and no one could harm me. It was one of the brightest and most productive periods of my life. Then I met T.
	
   We worked at the same shitty pizza joint and my tiny pupils caught his eyes one day. ""So you get down with opiates?"" That one sentence was the start of something both beautiful and terrifying. He came over that night with an Opana 40 and I had never insufflated anything. He explained the oral vs intranasal bioavalibilities of oxymorphone to me, so I made the decision to take a whiff. ""First time's free."" He broke off a tiny chunk, maybe 8 milligrams tops, I had never been so wonderfully high. I'd switch from bubbly energetic to lethargic to vomitting and back over the course of five minutes, but I loved every second of it. 
	
   After that night I knew that this was how I wanted to be for the rest of my life. Constantly nodding, immune to pain, fear and doubt. Heartbreak and longing no longer existed when it came to other humans. Only catching the next train and riding it until it toppled off the track.  Ophelia, Dolly Parton, and Roxanne, those were the only girls I needed. They were the difference between magic and hell on earth. We thought they were expensive lays back then, but the price was easily half of what it is today. 
	
   Which brings me to my one true love, Lady Heroin. A pill connection of ours started dating a guy who had it on deck 24/7. All it took was a text and a three minute drive and I'd get twice the bang for my buck. I was still only insufflating but gods, it was wonderful. The good times with friends, the mystical music sessions, the junkie sluts and the sex they brought. 
	
   Our twosome had grown into a foursome by then. Me, T, L, and her boyfriend N. I wouldn't say that we were truly junkies then. Only T had ever shot anything and that was a long time ago when he was addicted to coke. N went to the Suboxone Dr, T and L both had Methadone connections. Withdrawal was hardly ever a problem, maybe six hours of minor discomfort at most before we could score. It was all made easier by the fact that L and N were our primary dealers and our best friends. 
	
   Need a 30 but don't have any cash? It's okay L will front you a few until payday. Too fiscally fucked to buy the good stuff? It's okay, N will give you a sub until you've got the cash to binge again. Sometime during this period L and T started banging and kept telling me how it was the greatest thing ever. I'd never snort anything else again. Being terrified of needles, I resisted for a time, but after watching them do it so much I eventually gave into it. It was the best and worst decision I've ever made.
	
   I show up at L and N's place one night after work. Everyone's already fading, well everyone except for L. To this day I've never seen her nod and she does shots that would make Jim Morrison cry. They loaded up two blues for me and T tied me off and helped me take the plunge. I had never had a more profound experience than the first time I saw the red flower bloom. I thought DMT had shown me enlightenment years ago but this feeling, this rush of pure  bliss was like nothing I'd ever experienced. 
	
   The next day we went through the same ritual, but we had some good ECP. Holy fucking shit, goddamn! I thought spiking 30's was intense, that the blue and red snowglobe was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen; It was nothing. Nothing compared to that dirty brown that itches your skin if you don't clean your tip. The tingling behind my ears, the feeling of all of my life's woes being washed away more and more with every unit T pushed in me.
	
   At the time I was awful at banging. I couldn't hit a vein to save my life, so I'd ride to L's house with my stash three times a day and get her to do it for me. She's always had the magic touch when it comes to rigs. Things were great for a while, until a point a day turned into two into three into four and so on and so forth. We could all tell that we were getting worse and worse, but we didn't give a fuck. We had a heroin buffet at the house. What else would we ever need? Then the bad times came.
	
   T ended up stealing everything he could get his hands on; lost his job for it. So he started taking his parents' jewelry up to the pawnshop until he got caught. N and L got to the point where Suboxone wouldn't help them anymore on the dry days and I ended up seeing a stripper with a heart of gold who essentially got me clean for a time. We had a mutual friend though, and she was still railing rockos on a daily basis. I was able to turn her down the first few times but after I found out that the stripper (Henceforth known as Ms. SquirtyPants) had been doing meth, adderal and molly day in and day out without telling me I eventually caved. I caved hard.
	
   By then I'd mastered the art of rigging my sails and getting my ship out of port. Almost everyone at my workplace was on some form of opiate and it was easy to get the cash for my smack from them. Sell some Norcos, use the cash to buy 30's, sell them and turn all the profit into boy. I'd fade out standing in line at the grocery store. I'd pass out over my keyboard every night. During the day I felt invulnerable physically, mentally enlightened and socially adept. The best part was that no one who I didn't want to know suspected a thing.
	
   N and L progressively got worse and worse off. They started going down the same path that T did. I'll admit to being a junkie, but I've never stolen from anyone I care about. I've given my last mg of Suboxone to a friend because I'd rather withdrawal than see them sick. I started to notice that none of my goodwill was reciprocated. I'd let N borrow .5 for the night and he'd pay me back with barely .1 the next day. 
	
   One day everything went dry. It was sick city for all three of us and everyone for themselves. I decided to detox and get it over with so that I could come back with a fresh set of receptors and catch the dragon again. Well a few nights into the withdrawals I ended up picking up some Xanax from a friend. I don't normally do benzos but Christ, I wanted to sleep and heard that they helped. 
	
   They helped alright. On my way home I railed four blues and drank a bottle of DXM syrup. I was still blacked out the next morning when I wrecked my car less than a mile from my house. Was arrested and charged with DUI. Luckily the only thing they found when they searched my car was an unused rig that they couldn't charge me with. I ended up spending a week in county until my junkie pals got up enough scratch to bail me out. I had detoxed by that time but PAWS is a bitch isn't it?
	
   The first thing I did, literally the minute I got in the car was get high. Caught the dragon in my flower again. Delicious. Why would I ever want to stop? Even the days, the weeks, of misery suddenly seem worth it as soon as that plunger is done pushing. Every time I've quit in the past I've had abolutely no intention of quitting permanently. I've always felt that if you love something as much as life itself you shouldn't completely isolate yourself from it because you lack the strength to moderate. Which was always my goal, I wanted to be a heroin junkie without being a junkie. I wanted all the highs and none of the lows.
	
   Tonight I'm on my sixth day of involuntary withdrawal. N ended up stealing the last bit of my cash and left me dry. I'm actually starting to question my life choices again. I've always told myself to regret nothing, but I can't help to feel it when I look back to what I was and forward to what I'll become if I continue down the path. I'm getting paid tomorrow though and so is L. We've had plans to get a huge score and blow our fucking minds. Half of me doesn't want to. Maybe one day when I'm completely withdrawal free, but the other half is constantly checking the clock. Waiting for my check to go through, waiting for L to call and say she's on the way with a Santa sack of vinegar rocks. 
	
   I know that I'll cave as soon as the opportunity arises and I'll be sick again next week, but part of me keeps thinking it's all worth it. I've realized that I love opiates more than anyone, more than anything. I don't need anything or anyone; all I need Is a rig with 50 units of yellow brown goodness in it and I go from a slave in hell to a god on the throne of the cosmos.

I moved to try to get away from addiction, but of course it followed me here. In this new town, opiates are hard to come by. I've been scammed, beaten and overcharged by middlemen, but I still seek them out. Though the financial expense is so much that i now have to steal to get by, and my paychecks are gone within 1 day, and really I can only afford to get properly high once or twice a week, and though i go far out of my way and spend every last dime I have to make it happen at all, I still seek them out.

Fuck I'm sick of this cycle. Heroin was at least fucking easy to get. New town and shitty connects just makes doing this too hard to even be worth it, but I still do it. Fuck I'm so broke.

I was heartbroken and heartsick for one girl and seeing another who was an addict.  Naive as I was, I spent a long time trying to convince her to quit.  I would call off work or sit up all night to stay with her.  I made her tea and tried to distract her with cards and board games.  Eventually I would have to leave the house and when I came back she'd be gone.  I knew she'd gone to cop and it broke me apart inside. I was scared and depressed, I was in love with William Burroughs and Kurt Cobain, I still am.  

If you love someone and they love dope  there's a good chance you'll eventually give it a try.  Sarah* didn't have a car and needed to score.  She asked me if I would drive her across town to some shitty parking lot to meet her dealer (she never lied to me about drugs that I know of.)  I'd been trying to help her get clean for months and failing, and something just snapped.  I told her she could take the car herself as long as she split the bag with me.  She looked surprised and a little shocked, but there was no way she was going to turn down the offer.  One hour later she was sticking a needle in my arm.

I was always terrified of needles, to the point where I'd had to be held down at the doctor's office when I was due for vaccines.  I was cured of that fear more or less instantly.  Most people start with pills and work their way up, snorting or plugging dope for a long time before they start using IV.  I didn't give a shit.  I figured it was all the same and if I was doing this I ought to go all in.  It was and is the best feeling I've ever had, and that night was one of the best of my life.

It's been a long time since then and I'm pretty much clean at this point, but I still think about that night.

First and foremost though, I have to say from what I've seen, you guys are probably the most tight-nit and down to earth group I've seen on reddit.  You don't have any delusions about who or what you are, and you support each other no matter what.  That's amazing in my book!

As for me, I've been on pain killers for about 8 years for migraines and (most recently) degenerative disk disease in my lower back.  I only get 5's of roxi (120 every 4 weeks), and my pain doc refuses to increase me because I'm ""a young guy"" and he doesn't want me to be an addict.  Unfortunately, this also means I run out well before my next refill.  My mom, however, gets 30's, and when she can, she'll hook me up (which isn't often enough).  I don't have any other hookups and I have no clue how to cold cop (although I've heard CT is pretty easy to score 15's and 30's; I just don't have any connections whatsoever).

Anyway, I just got one 30 from my mom, and that'll be it until I can get my next refill on Friday, so I figured it'd be a good time to introduce myself.  So, you all rock, and stay classy all!!!",1391489914.0

Anyway, it's been sitting there for at least six months. Doubtless there are countless layers of dust on it.

So last night I made a tea from 1 LB of Bob's Red Mill poppy seeds. I drank about 3/4 of it and decided to wait, as I haven't made PST or PPT in years. It started out great, I was feeling warm, my limbs were getting heavy, the usual symptoms of coming up on morphine / PPT. There was very little to no euphoria though, and as I felt the effects more and more, I never really felt much euphoria at all. What's weird though is how much I felt the bodily effects of the tea. After an hour or two, my limbs were extremely heavy, my breathing labored, and coordination off. I wasn't really ODing, nor was I nodding, but I was Fucked up sans any of the good feelings. Any idea what happened? Did I just get a bad batch that was really high in some of the less desirable alkaloids? Thanks",1391467065.0

I've been a pretty moderate painkiller user for a couple of years now, a handful of percocet in the morning to get me through the day, but when i tried the good stuff for the first time I had a ball. Thanks to [removed for content] I met an amazingly nice guy who hooked me up with some boi and I had a ball. Once I got back to my dorm though that's when things went hairy. I was supposed to meet up with a girl who I had been chatting up for a while and I was nervous, so I did a little line and then another and then another until I was very high. The girl who we'll call 'berna' for now came to my room and we started making out, I was already really high so this felt amazing. We started talking and I was slurring like a motherfucker so she asked why, and this is where I made my first mistake. I assumed since she was a dealer she wouldn't really care what I was on but more just wanted to know so she wouldn't feel like she was taking advantage of me, so I told her I did a little bit of dope. She flipped out. She told me that if I was going to be doing that she didn't want to have anything to do with me, and she left. I tried to patch things up with her today and she said she would at most want to be just friends. I know I shouldn't really care that much, but I really had feelings for berna, she was someone I could have seen being in a relationship with. Bottom line I just wanted to give a little warning about who you tell your habits about.

to pick up tar every couple weeks. Before I had any time sober I was on straight junky status, you know the drill, anything to get my fix and to keep from getting sick. 



So for the past 2 or 3 months i've been making these roadtrips to get tar usually every week or two, but 
there have been weeks where i make two or three trips. 65$ in gas to get 60 a g tar, and i never came home with less than a G. When i'm not using i don't even really care that i don't have it... which is a novel experience to say the least. On those days i'm perfectly content with going to work and smoking weed in my apartment when i get off. I even got my new job after i started chipping. Haven't gone to work on opiates yet and don't plan to, but one night i made a trip and got a call that they needed me the next day. So i did a shot of meth and drove home to work at 6am on no sleep and no one was the wiser.



Well... it's just been a little strange to me that it's been this easy to chip. I never feel like i NEED to get 
high anymore. I have today off from work and i have no weed and no tar but i'm completely content with just chilling and watching netflix and cleaning my apartment while sober. I really don't want this to change.... everythings going really well and i'm saving money to move back to the east coast... However...





In a couple days I'm going to make another one of these trips to pick up a half ounce of tar for 500. I plan
 on doing half of it and flipping the other half, because in the city i'm in there's no dope, hence the roadtrips. I know I could do 6gs and flip the other 6 and still profit. I just know how this is going to end up... but i've already made the decision and everything is set up. 



Addict rationalization: I can flip this shit and profit and get cash to move home faster

what i know's gonna happen: Gonna do as much of the dope as i can while still breaking even and end up dope sick running 350 miles away every week to re-up.



anyways i don't really know why i made this post.... does anyone have any tips for this 500$ deal in a couple days? 

When I was dealing weed i'd buy a half a week but it was still way less sketchy because it was just
 weed and i'd known the guy for years. These guys have helped me out for the past couple months but i've 
never bought anything over 150 from them...
 My boy's coming with me, but it's still gonna be 2 white kids with 2 old tatted up mexicans who know we live 
in another state....  I know all the obvious rules and pretty good at picking up red flags, and i feel OKAY about this but not completely comfortable, anything i should know to make this run smoothly? and it's definitely okay 
for me to ask for a test shot before i hand over the cash right?



One of the reasons I feel a little off about it is the pricing. it's usually straight 60/g with no breaks. But i 
was asking about what he'd throw me for 400 and he said he could only do 7gs for 400, but if i had 500 he'd throw me 12gs (a mexican half). This was a couple weeks ago when i set it up, But that pricing just seems a 
little fucked up, or maybe i'm not used to how bulk prices work with tar...



I feel completely comfortable flipping it and everything, and i've done deals over 500 several times and i 
know i can take care of myself in most situations, but that was all on the east coast and i feel a little out of my element here, mainly because i'm white and don't speak spanish, haha.



anyways this post is kinda all over the place, this is just the shit i've been thinking about lately and i'd like to hear /r/opiates thoughts.

So being as me and this awesome guy have been talking alot this last month i sent him a PM asking if he was okay and what was going on. The response pained me quite thuroughly and thought all of you guys and gals should know whats happening to one of our own. So here is his response in its entirety that he gave me permission to post. http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1iwo83

He doesnt want pitty which i can completely understand, but i just want everyone to keep him in your hearts and minds while he is having the adventure of his life.

Don't list ridiculous and unrealistic things like ""they're a model who loves to fuck and give away free dope.""

But really, you as the opiate buying public, what's important to you?

Answering calls and texts with truthful info?
Showing up when they said they would?
Never shorting bags or offering too big of a middleman tax?
Having set hours and sticking to them?
A variety of products (coke, benzos, etc) or would you rather have a dealer who focused on just dope or just pills?

What else?  

I'm doing this for a friend who's thinking about dealing pills on the side (he gets a massive script each month).  I told him it's a bad idea and he should just sell to me, but after that was rebuffed, I told him that I read a community of users and could give him some ideas.  He's very corporate and focus groups are part of his daily life, so I thought this would be an interesting experiment. ",1391579701.0

Another time while driving to pick up my friend so that we could assist each other in becoming slightly more sedated than we were.  I saw a cat on the side of the road.  All four legs squeezed together, taking what appeared to be quite a massive shit.  Looking directly at me with those cold dead eyes.  My next thought was, I should tell homegirl about this damn cat.  But what color do I want to describe it as?  It's sort of a tan color.  Almost a sandy orange.  Oh, i know just the thing to describe this color to her.  I shall name this color: Morphine Orange.

Chapter Ten: The Hebrides

I rode, and with the anxiety of leaving New Jersey finally faded I was able to slump into my seat. A smear of deep red was peeking out from the holes in my tattered sweatshirt, yet I felt no eyes upon me. I let the ripped and broken padding of the seat comfort me as I finally took in the details of my surroundings. The window was smeared with the crust of former hands and other nastiness I couldn't quite pinpoint. Nor did I want too. The window was sealed yet I felt a warm draft rushing in between all the tiny cracks this particular tramcar held. And for once, in the middle of running, in the middle of bloodshed, I took a deep and long breath. Holding it in I shut my eyes and let the breeze swallow me, blanketing the fear from returning. Peace. 

With my eyes closed and my breath held tightly in I began to imagine the home I'd always wanted. Allowing the airstream to guide me, taking me to my new home I imagined a place. A mental safe haven. A place I'd never seen yet the details began to flow in as if someone was building this world specifically for me. Outside the daydream I knew I was on flat ground in the car. Yet still, with my eyes closed I knew this, as I felt the shift moments earlier. I sensed the wild grass outside the car change as my mind began to build. I was feeling ever engulfed in this world, my senses were starting to intensify and It all felt so truly real. Dark cliffs formed in the blackness as water followed which violently crashed against them. Their jagged edgings and little crevasse created the oddest sound with the angry title waves. Seagulls screeched as they flew overhead, and in their own grind completely ignored me. And here I stood, in this world, on a grassy meadow above it all. Looking down. I exhaled the long breath and opened my eyes. 

Here I was. My world. I had created it, and it was completely mine. But where was I? It was so strangely beautiful, yet it was an angry place. I sensed I was alone on this meadow, and searched for some sort of bearing. This place must be an island. I saw desolate and broken ships in the background, moaning quietly as they accepted their defeat. There must of been ten, no fifteen ships. Large and old ships, forgotten about, left to decay amidst the zone they had fallen prey too. It was then, as I looked out amidst the water a hermit crab scurried beyond an ancient path beside me. I turned to follow it and found myself walking amidst strange forms of weeds and grasses. Still hearing the water, the seagulls, and the moaning of the ships I followed. It led me down the hill between two large rocks, and in the horizon I saw a stranded beach. It was my guide and I happily followed. 

.""Well, what do you think?"" The hermit questioned whilst scurrying ahead. I found no tongue, no way to answer back. ""This... this young Devon, is where we all go."" I continued to follow as questions began to fill my head. Is this real? Had I descended into hell whilst riding that musty old train car? ""No, this isn't hell. Far from it, now please, quiet your mind and follow. You'll understand when we get there"". 
Down the path and passed the black rocks the hermit led me onto the sandy shores of a beach. It wasn't then, sense I first set foot in this place that I realized I was bare footed. In fact my attire had changed completely. I wore pressed and comfortably fitting dress pants, accomplice by a clean white shirt, and buttoned down collar shirt. Clothing I would have forgotten existed had it not been for my step father. In the moments of examining myself the warm breeze pushed me forward as its current brushed passed through my fingers. I realized I had moved forward onto the beach quite a bit. Sand clung to my feet and pant bottoms. ""Take a moment,"" The creature spoke strangely, it's voice seeming to sound like my own. I did as instructed and planted myself down on the sand. Looking around the beach I noted it's oval shape, and another boat sticking upright against the corner of the right side. This was the biggest vessel yet, and looked to used for transporting cargo. Somehow amidst it's crash large red shipping containers laid strewn about. Some were closed, and others had been ripped open by tiny rocks. Their contents had  been ejected violently ejected and now lay resting. They were small shiny objects which littered the surrounding tan sun beat sand. One in particular caught my eye, and was in hands reach, I picked it up. I felt ill upon rubbing the damp sand from its square shape. It was old, and looked more decayed than the boat which had brought it. But that's not what made me ill. It was a picture frame with a ripped photo of me and my father. His face was cut in half by a split, yet my half of the photo was in perfect condition. I was young, with a smile on my face, and wearing the same clothing I wore now. 

I cried as the gentle tide met with my toes. I stared at the photo, clutching it in my palms for nearly a minute before placing it back where lay originally. Standing up, I decided to look harder. Rushing from location to location I realized all of these objects were once possessions of mine. From a hockey jersey, to my old teddy bear, they were all there. I saw no blood, no drugs, no needle. Just my childhood. The crying turned into a full sob, and I fell in the tide. I wept heavy tears. They fell amidst the still flowing water, and were happily swept away from me. In the corner of my eye I spotted the hermit, who was motioned me to follow. I did as instructed. 

Another lonely path, another ancient walkway. As I left the beach I felt the sadness rinse over me. I said or thought nothing as of note as I followed the creature upwards another hill. We passed by many small caves which illuminated themselves amongst the black cliffs in a blue and greenish hue. And it wasn't until we reached the end of the dirt road that the hermit stopped, staring directly in front of a low hanging cave. 

""I'm sorry, Devon, but I cannot follow beyond this point. You'll understand everything when you get there."" I didn't even have time to think of a response before the creature vanished into the tall weeds surrounding the trail. I looked back at the beach in the distance. The waves beating against the exposed hall. The objects of my childhood strode about. I then entered the cave. 
My journey had felt long, yet I hadn't traveled far at all. It was beginning to drain on me and I just wanted to return to that disgusting tramcar. The nice dress clothing I had worn just earlier on the beach had become tattered and broken with each inch I crawled and manipulated through the cave. Oddly enough I still felt the warm breeze which kept me driving forward. And, nearly 300 meters deep into the void I heard an echo. As I stepped forward it became audible, and very familiar. Then, in an open chamber while heavy flowing water I saw it. The waterfall, acting like the surface of a movie screen showed a scene I had once lived. I watched my mother screaming at me as I laid sunken deep into my mattress, unresponsive and distant. It wasn't until she shook me that I responded. I yelled, and screamed at her to leave me alone. She screamed again and left the room while slamming the door. I remembered the needle entering my arm moments earlier, I remember getting high.  A single tear rushed passed my cheek as I walked into the waterfall. 

The waterfall had transported me. Now, I stood in the middle of a prairie with a house in the distance. I looked down and saw the hermit again. It looked straight up at me while crouching in the dirt and dust. I thought to him, unable to speak still. 
""This is where we all come. All your memories, all your emotions. All here. Never with you. You have built this place to send every negative feeling or emotion. This is our prison, Devon."" Once again I felt scared, in fact I was purely terrified. And as the fear flooded over me the ground began to shake. The sky turned a dark black and the cliffs began to crumble. In an explosive force I felt the island shifting and heard it screaming. ""Thank you, Devon. Thank you"". And then there was nothing. Just blackness. 
I opened my eyes. And while exhaling, I spotted the same stained window. And reluctantly I was in the same clothing. The red was still exposed in the holes of my sweatshirt. I recalled my thoughts, and even though they felt very distant, I knew what I had to do. I stood up as the tram was approaching its first stop. Before coming to an end of its journey I looked behind me to see a young boy leaning over the seat behind me.  He smiled at me and whispered ""Thank you, Devon"".

I never meant to bring any drama to this sub.  It can be difficult since when people meet as couples on this sub, we all use this as a place to rant.  /u/KSM420-421 shouldn't have made our personal issues public.  I know that he was just trying to help me, sadly you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink.  /u/KSM420-421 can and will work through our shit & continue to stand by each other fight this struggle daily.


*That being said, I've come to realize that i'm not ready emotionally & mentality to get sober.  As a fellow addict he understands this and we will be there for each other through the shit life throws at us.*

So instead of paying $18 a day, it's free.

Once I started methadone (I was also on subutex before my break), I was having a difficult time trying to stop using heroin. 

Three weeks ago it was my paid day, so I decided to get off on some random stop downtown. This guy came up to me and asked if he could get a cig for a dollar. I'm like, sure. I ended up giving him another one because I'm not that greedy of a bitch.

I was waiting for my train to head downtown and he offered to smoke me a bowl. He was super attractive, so I told him no and that I needed to catch the next train. Then I changed my mind and decided to take him up on the offer. 

Maybe I'm a little slut but he ended up back at my place later that night. I found out that he was on methadone too. He just started a couple of weeks when I met him that night, kicking a three year habit. 

The night I met him was the day he ended it with his girlfriend. Apparently she was used to him stealing every day from a store and exchanging the goods for money to go cop. He was refusing to do it, so she told him she was leaving to go use with a guy that would give her free dope. He told her if she left that night, they were over.

Welp, that was around the 16th. He's now my boyfriend and I haven't used since the day I met him. It's weird how life works and if I would've caught that train, I'd probably still be using myself and wouldn't be having the best sex of my life.

He's so damn attractive, understanding, and he has such a good heart.  He does everything to make me feel good about myself and he's been there for me when my cravings have popped up in the past two weeks. 

I just feel guilty that he probably would've gotten back with his ex-girlfriend (who would send him 100s of text a day for the first week we were together). She has faked a suicide or OD or something along those lines. Also, they were together for three years. However, he tries to assure me that he was very unhappy in his previous relationship and the way he feels with me he hasn't felt in very long time.

Plus that stupid self-esteem voice in my head that says it isn't going to last and he'll move on. 

But I feel like I've honestly met my match and I'm just going to ride out the goodness until it's over.

I dunno. I'm just rambling. 

If I would've gotten back on that train... Haha, I guess I'm so glad something good is finally happening in my life and having chemistry with  someone for the first time is absolutely amazing. And he gets and understands me. I was dating guys in recovery that were never addicts and they just...don't get it sometimes. It's been awesome.

I would never date 99% of the people at my clinic and he goes to a different one, so I feel like the stars aligned for us to meet that night and he saved me. I don't want to end up dead to my addiction.

On a different note, I left behind my friend was using with for those two weeks. I feel so scared for him because he shoots up alone. He has roommates but they're not always there. I have a bad feeling one day I'm going to get a phone call and he won't be there anymore. He was my buddy that was there when I started using. We lived together and would always pick up together. But I have to move on and live my life for me. ",1391563892.0

After a year and a half of use, I started to shoot up, second worst decision of my life. I sold everything that was precious to me, I lost who I was. I had many hobbies, then suddenly, I had heroin as my hobby, and it was my only hobby. Heroin was my everything. At about 5 years into my downward spiral of destruction, a close friend of mine, who was only a user for a few months over dosed... He died. You know what I did after his funeral? I sold the watch that his parents gave me because he wanted me to have it. Just so I could get my fix. I was a piece of shit and I didn't give a shit... But sadly this wasn't my rock bottom. So it was a long 2 days of withdrawls, I was sick as FUCK. I felt and looked like death. So me and my ""friends"" drove to Anacostia in D.C. looking to score. We ended up finding a group of a guys, that was pointed out to us by the local crack whore, and my one friend who was African American thought it would be better if he went up and tried to score. He was terribly mistaken. They took him down a cut (alley) and said that their boy was waiting there. with in seconds they surrounded him and beat him down. I heard two gun shots, my driver just sped off after that. Lets call my African American friend AJ, AJ was a childhood friend of mine, my parents knew his parents and his parents knew my parents, he was like my brother. So after me almost killed the driver, ( I broke his nose and fractured his cheek ) I called AJ's parents immediately and told them what happened. Their screams of agony still haunt me today, the sound of his mother voice cracking as she screams still echoes in my mind.

This is starting to get really hard for me to type so I'm just going to quickly finish it up. The next day after what happened to AJ I found a suboxone program and got myself in. Not a single day passes that I don't think about my friends who passed and that I feel like it was all my fault. Most days I'm so depressed I feel like death wouldn't be so bad. But, I'm not that selfish, it would break my mom/dads heart more then I already have...

Anyways, moral of the story unless you want to go through a living hell, don't do heroin, roxy(blues), percs, oxy, even vicodin. Be smart. I made it out with collapsed veins and THAT'S lucky. I'm living day to day, just working and gaming, trying to keep myself busy. I cry daily about the deaths of my friends and the decline the ones that are still hooked.

Looking to help other PST users and improve my own methods. Lets compare notes!,"So for my PST I like to use Bob's Red Mill seeds. I typically start with 2 pounds. I place the seeds in a 1 gallon water jug. I then proceed to pour Arizona's Arnold Palmer ice tea/lemonade. I use this because it's very cheap and I have read that using a more acidic solution will help activate certain alkaloids. So then I proceed to shake the jug violently for 2 minutes. I only shake for two minutes because I have read that if the seeds are soaked for too long they begin to absorb liquid, and enevitably the opiates. After shaking I pour the liquid into a separate container, and that concludes what I like to call a ""wash"" (as in I just washed the seeds). Now typically I buy the 42 ounce Arnold Palmers and only use half for the wash on two pounds of seeds. Then I proceed to use the rest of the Arnold Palmer and do a second wash. I then add that to the liquid I have in my container. In my experience I never get back all the liquid I put into the jug so at this point I am left with about 32 ounces of opiate infused beverage. Now I open up another Arnold Palmer and do a third and final (and optional) wash. This puts me at a little more then 42 ounces of tea. Now I drink it as fast as I can haha.

Typically in my experience this doesn't get me super high. I transferred from heroin to tea in an attempt to get off dope as it had been really taking a toll on me. I was using about a 1/2 gram a day, sometimes two or three times a day for about 4 years. So I have a bit of a tolerance. What this does for me is puts me in a really good mood with very subtle tinges of euphoria. The bonus is I can feel the ""glow"" of the tea for about 6-8 hours and usually don't start to feel sick till a day or so later. 

But I have been wondering if I am doing this as efficiently as possible? Am I getting the most out of my tea? Does any one else know of better techniques? I have only been practicing this for about 3 months now so I'd say I'm still pretty new to tea. What do you guys think?",1391547599.0

The moment the penny dropped for me was when i was talking with my brother about our purpose in life a few years ago. 

The conversation went something like this: 

Bro: ""Well...What's your goal in life?""

OP: ""To be as happy as possible!""

Bro: ""How do you measure your happiness?""

OP: ""It's probably the levels of chemical stimulators in your brain or something along those lines.""

Bro: ""Well then why don't you do drugs to increase them huh?""

OP: ""Oh...yeeeaaah....But that's not real because i know i didn't earn it...""

And then after my poor response (which i didn't really believe but used to deflect the chat) the conversation drifted off to another topic. But that idea was still in my mind and it slowly grew and grew until curiosity overwhelmed me.

I guess i just find it weird to remember that point of inception.

Here goes: 

First a little background. I am scripted opana and also oxycodone and have been for two years. Even though this is a dream for most opiate users it is love hate relationship for me. I'm always telling myself this month will be different but I always end up dope sick within a week of getting my RX filled. Herein lies my downfall because of course who wants to be dope sick I'm out on the street hustling buying anything to make me feel better even H when I don't have any other options.

So here's my question: how do you guys make your script or whatever even your dope stash last? Any little tricks you pull in yourself? I myself have tried using a safe and giving someone else the key which of course didn't work because I just took it back and I've also tried this hiding shit from myself to find it later on a rainy day and that just doesnt work either.
Also, I forgot to mention I IV everything. I'm mentioning this because it speaks to my tolerance which of course has sky rocketed in the last 6 months which is when I started IVing.

Thanks I'm advance for any insight and stay safe my friends.

TL;DR I have no self control and can't stay well because I waste what I'm lucky to get scripted to me. ",1391539396.0

I don't know why I thought this but I have for awhile, and I swear I got it from somewhere...

Apparently they aren't, so wtf is wrong with me?? Did the laws used to be stricter, or am I just dumb? Does anyone know more about this? I can't find much, not without having to dig through a shit ton of other info, and it's 5 am, but an article about the ppl arrested for selling Hoffman h said that they will *definitely* not be charged with any kind of murder, because the law requires there be an intent to murder (as it should, obviously, duh). And I don't know why a dealer who sold shit to an OD victim, who *wasn't* extremely flippin famous, would be charged with anything more severe than Hoffman's guys. I just realized this: It's like yin and yang; celebrities get much less punished for their crimes, but I bet any other noncelebrities involved (and therefore on the news as well, I mean) get extra punished to be made an example of. Maybe? Idk. 

I'm sorry, I will do better research next time, I've just honestly always thought that until now! Do they at least get charged with something worst than drug dealing?

Whatever I could get my hands on. Heroin, Oxycodone, Dilaudid, Opana, whatever the fuck you had,  I would slam it. It became to the point where I was stealing out of cars, and doing little scams to make money (stealing merch, returning for giftcards), where eventually I caught a few Second Degree Burglaries and went to Prison for awhile. Just got out about four months ago, and I immediately started doing the same shit (getting high, not stealing -- yet). My family has given me so many chances, they love me so much, but they would most likely just drop me like a bad habit if they found out what I was doing again. I'm about to be 24 years old, thankfully I'm realizing that this isn't the way to live at a young age -- I just hope that I'm able to get a hold of things before it's too late. I currently have an ankle monitor around my ankle, and I'm still waking up at 8am every day to hustle and cop. Today I made the choice to wake up at 3:30am, and go to the local methadone clinic, and get put on methadone. I had my first dose around 8:00am of 30mg of methadone, and I'll be going up 5mg a day until I'm comfortable. I still ended up feeling shitty this evening, and just spent the next 3 days money for the clinic, and bought a dilaudid. I don't know how I'm going to go to the clinic tomorrow, but I'll hustle up a measly 9.00$ somehow. This is a vicious circle, and I hope that it ends soon, because I can't take much more of it.

My question is, how do I let my doctor know that this pain is above and beyond anything that ibuprofen or tylenol could handle?

Finally got my tax return. Ca came through! Been waiting to hit up my connect so  I called him as soon as I saw the balance and...

Nothing...he's all out and.his friends are all out too.

I figured as long as I never got physically addicted my shit was under control. I was meant to pick up two weeks supply of lovely #4 today and was told its not happening till Monday now. This is the first time I havent been able to score when I've wanted to..

That's 48 mother-fucking hours, I really, really dont want to have to wait that long, I wish I could just go to sleep and wake up on Monday. If only I had enough xanax to do just that I probably would lol..

And thats when it sort of hit me, the fact that the next two days are going to be excruciatingly annoying, I dont want to be awake this weekend without heroin, it was meant to be here and I think thats whats pissing me off the most.

I was meant to be high right now, I was not going to have any problems if it was here today. Everything was going to be fine and dandy like usual.

It made me think of you poor peeps with physical addictions, god knows how you do it, to crave it hard and feel physically sick on top of it must be the real nightmare.

I feel *seriously* lame and to be honest, *embarrassed* after defending myself to like 300 people yesterday saying that I didnt have a problem in some thread that blew up. I guess I felt so strong because I thought I'd have a nice two week supply of smack awaiting me the next day. Hell who cant wait 12 hours knowing you got a big bag coming...its not fun but at least its not two whole god damn days.

I know half of yall will be laughing at this and thats 100% warranted.
I guess I just binged a bit hard for a bit long the last two months, it has been so easy to get, I haven't had to do without it and I guess its easy to say you don't have a problem when you have easy access to all the smack you can want. 

But yeah...to tldr myself, I guess it took until I couldnt get it to realize oh shit I really fucking want it, maybe even more than that, I really dont want to be without it right now. My 'life' situation is kind of in a low point(had to move back in with parents while I find a new place and all my friends are an hour+ drive away) and that has got me down. 

I just hope that when im back at Uni next week that it takes my mind off wanting to score and be high all the time because it really sucks wanting to bang that shit and not being able to get my hands on some.

On one hand all my problems would be solved with a big bag of heroin, on the other im for the first time seeing that when I cant get it,  I find it hard to think of much else. Booze and Benzo's just arnt cutting it like they used to.

I can get some weed tomorrow, that will probably help a bit to take my mind off things, but yeah, damn. 

Had this so under control last year, two week binges banging 3 shots a day followed by huge breaks without thinking about it twice. Lets hope its just that I have way to much free time on my hands right now and Uni can save me from thinking about it so much.

I dont even know what you'd reply to a rant like this but for what ever its worth it felt good to write it out, I know ill be fine, I just needed a whine because this all sucks a bit. Peace.

Warning: Depressing.,"**TLDR: This is something I wrote about the worst day of my life.  If you do care to read:  June is my 14 year old little sister, Trevor is my ex boyfriend that was living with us at the time.**

It started off as any other seemingly normal day.  June was starting her freshman year at high school in a week.  We decided to celebrate and treat her to lunch and a night of fun.  We had to make the twenty mile trip to Trevor’s bank and we had just missed the bus, ""You stay here and we will text you when we are back in town.""  We walked the mile to town and had planned on hitchhiking when we ran into my mother.  Instead of crossing the street and ducking like I normally would I said hello hoping for a ride.  I happened to mention we were planning on going to the new restaurant in town and that it was really good. ""Want a free lunch and I'll drop you off after.""  We ate lunch very anxiously just wanting to go pick up the pills. It took an hour and half but we finally got dropped off at the bank, right before closing at four.  We took out a hundred bucks and my mother drove us back to town and dropped us off ten minutes from our dealers.  At six we had snorted enough lines and our dealer had brought us rum.  My sister came to meet us and threw a fit that we had already gone to the restaurant and with mom no less.  


We ate at Mcdonalds and walked back home with an upset June sulking behind us. My dad had a phone interview the next morning and went to bed sober by seven. Which left us up to party the night away as we pleased.  


The next few hours I spent with my sister are blackness, tainted with the smoke of marijuana and the bitter taste of rum.  I sat on the ground glued to my Ipad as usual playing game after game.  My sister sat on the only chair nodding off every once in awhile.  Every thirty minutes or so Trevor would dole out a little white pill to each of us, nudging Lily awake in the process.  


My dad came out to tell us to keep the noise level down.  June came back from the bathroom stumbling and visibly drunk.  My dad tells her that she has to go to bed.  I vividly remember telling her not to worry and that I loved her as I hugged her. It seemed like forever that my dad sat lecturing Trevor and I, this was the last straw he had to move out.  I remember it seemed like I looked up and he was gone, ""Where did dad go?"".  Trevor looked up and replied, ""Where did June go?"".  Then everything goes black as I slipped back into the robot I was so comfortable being.  Sean shaking me until I came into consciousness, glancing at the clock, 4:26AM. ""Are you crazy? Leave me alone.""  ""Come on Clare just a bowl and a cigarette."" I hesitatingly pulled myself up and ordered Trevor to get me a glass of water.  I looked around for my ever needed Ipad, it was nowhere to be found.  I had a sudden feeling that June had probably stolen it.  


As I walked into her room she was laying on the floor with a pillow over her face.  I laughed at the strange way that my sister so often slept when drunk.  Trevor suddenly appeared at the door and a look of concern flashed across his face. ""Something is wrong..""  He leaned forward and yanked the pillow off her face.  A orange puke stain on the ground and white foam on her mouth.  Her eyes partly open with a glassy dead look, yet her skin warm to the touch.  A scream I will never forget came out of my mouth.  


My dad was there in a second, me running to find Trevor’s phone to call 911.  I found myself unable to be in the room with my dad and Trevor.  Trevor repeated what the 911 operator was saying about CPR. I ran to my room to find our pill bottle and see how many there were left. I looked in all our regular hiding places and couldn't find it anywhere. 
 

It seemed like it took forever for the ambulance to arrive. I remember an EMT yelling, ""Her hearts not beating!"" I grabbed a random EMT and told them she probably took our methadone and promethazine. 


 In my heart I knew that she had overdosed.  My mind still clouded with drugs and alcohol from the night before.  My only thought was that she was young and had a strong heart.  I remember just thinking over and over that she would have a cool story to tell all her friends about the time she almost died.  I stood in our driveway and watched as they tried to resuscitate her.  Every time the paddles shocked her, her stomach heaved up and I thought it was a breath. 


My dad followed the ambulance in his car as the police questioned Trevor and I.  The house was taped off and we sat outside in the carport while being asked a million and one questions.  I just wanted to break the tape and run to get my phone incase my dad called.  The cops kept telling me to wait and calm down. I was calm though I was completely numb and refused to think she was dead.  I didn't shed a tear till the cops started whispering to each other.  Worried my dad was going to beat up Sean or me, he was coming back.  I sat on the sidewalk in the rain and sobbed, I knew she was dead before anyone told me.  My dad would have stayed at the hospital with her if she was okay. 


 I sat outside numb and still high.  ""Someone needs to call mom...""  ""You do it, I can't tell anyone else.""  My dad handed me his phone as I stood up. Tears streaming down my face I dial the familiar number. ""Something horrible as happened..."" 
 

The worst thing I had to do was tell her friends, facebook was out of the question.  I looked through her contact list for friends of her's that I knew.  None of them answered...I called a girl I knew was her best friend.  I had never met her face to face, ""Hi...This is June's sister...I have to tell you some bad news..June passed away last night.""  Sobbing I was barely able to choke them out.  ""What...? Is this a joke, June this isn't funny.....PLEASE tell me this is a joke!""  Lily friend said confused and worried. ""I'm so sorry this isn't a joke...I was drinking with her last night and she threw up when she was sleeping and choked...""  Her friend starts sobbing and I tell her I'll let her know about when we have the funeral and please tell her other friends.






This was the beginning of the end for me.  I've spent months ""going through the stages of grief"".  I've come to a place of acceptance but what doesn't change is the pain.  The constant void that aches, I wish I could say that I was able to heal & change myself.  That I took this experience and grew but I didn't, I want this so badly, yet sometimes *I just want to want it.*


Sometimes all I can do is sit in my pain, usually with a needle in my arm. I let it overcome me and be everything in my world. There are times, however fleeting when I can see things other people can't. I now have the ability to appreciate what others take for granted. *My life remains gloomy & dark to me, but I can see glimpses of the beauty in life as well.*


No one should ever have to find a loved one blue in the face and cold to the touch. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. No one should ever have to bury their 14-year-old sister.  Life is fucking cruel and unforgiving at times

*what I'm trying to say is that my pain sometimes lets me see the light, & sometimes I'm completely fucking blind.*

I'm in recovery, or at least I'm keeping clean, from daily use of fire #4, and have been for nearly 3 months bar a monster relapse. I went through 2.5g of the roads finest #4 in 2 days a few weeks ago. I know logistically the needle is next - that 2.5g would have lasted weeks, at least before i increased what is already a relatively large tolerance. Its a line i wont ever cross, that's the only thing I'm sure of with my future relationship with opiates. Anyway I'm rambling, sorry, trying to keep my mind busy!

I stopped 3 months ago when my son was born. I was in WDs when my wife hit labour and high as fuck when he was born and during the complications that followed. I work all week, and I struggle with the little voice but shrug it off now the same way I do nicotine cravings - gone after a few mins.

Saturdays tho. Damm. Saturdays are what got me hooked. I'd be nodding from 6pm Friday night to Sunday morning every weekend. I crave really bad on a Saturday even though I have a beautiful son and a day of cool shit planned with him. I usually eat a kpin or two on a Saturday.

Let me introduce myself as your typical long time lurker first time poster. I particularly enjoy reading your guys' stories about quick come-ups and shitty/great dealer experiences. Definitely a bookmark on the bored at work read-list.

Some background info: I've been during prescription opiates for about 5-6 years now. I have never touched dope although I'd like to think I have a decent knowledge of it due to research and again reading your guys' experiences with it. My DOC is methadone, which I feel like other than the small town I'm from, nobody particularly enjoys or values around these parts. I love being able to pop 40-60 mg of it depending on my tolerance at the time and being blasted all day long with no additional doses required. Because I have lived in a few different towns/cities during the course of my habit, I most frequently use dones or oxy. Oxy definitely is my second favorite and again I find myself going through heavier oxy phases because of its wider availability through pharm users/dealers compared to dones. If I could ever find a steady plug on dones, I would prefer them due to their duration of effects as well as financial benefits. For whatever reason, my oxy tolerance floats between 60-120 mg no matter how long of a break I take from it. Not the highest tolerance there ever was, but yeah doing dones is much cheaper. I usually snort my 30s even though I know popping them is probably better, but I exclusively chew the dones up. I don't IV and again have never had dope, even though it has been available to me if I desired it.

Which leads me to the juicy part of this story/post. Currently I moved for work (Managing my mom's restaurant) to a town an hr away from my hometown, as well as the big 206 which I lived in for 4 years. In this town the ONLY pills I have managed to find were blueberries. While my plug has been one of the most steady I have ever had, it's probably not much of a surprise because of this reliability my tolerance has reached its higher ends of my user history. Well for the first time in about 6 months, this plug has ran dry for a couple weeks and I've been without any opiates for 4 days. Besides detoxing from dones in jail these have been some of the lamest withdrawals I've had to go through, and my position at work as well as the long hours do not make them any better. After half a day of disappointment and searching, my guy got a call about some opanas. Now I have read much praise on this sub about the fabled opana, but in my entire term of use I have only encountered them on one occasion a few months ago and they were the shitty gel ones that I swallowed and as you can imagine was severely disappointed by its oral potency. So after a few long days of hurting as well as a long night shift ahead of me, this news didn't get me as excited at all. I was short on cash due to paying rent this week and even though at this point I could have used anything to help get me through work, I wasn't particularly excited to spend the last of my cash on some shitty E30's that I probably wouldn't even feel. But to my surprise, after telling my guy to ask what kind these were we soon found out they were the fabled G74's! AND to top it all off, this guy that my guy knew was willing to get rid of them for $20 a pop. So although I personally had very little experience with them, some quick research led me to conclude that this was a fucking steal. No shit gel --> green-light to go up the nose. After an hour journey total round-trip, I sat myself down to give an opana a whirl for the first legit time. I got floored, I haven't gotten this faded off of a pill since my early days of use. It feels like I ate a shit-ton of dones, or blasted like 4 30s up my nose. Work was awesome and hours later I still feel pretty great, similar to the benefits of dones that I prefer to 30's. So here I am with 3 left for the rest of the weekend, one day left of work, and my birthday on Sunday.

Hope you guys enjoyed my intro and good luck in all your searches for greatness. Although I consider myself decently experienced/versed in prescription pills, I have managed to open the door to something new and awesome.

TLDR: Recent binger had to suffer through w/d's for the first time in months all while having to work in customer service. Get insanely lucky in a time where all hope was lost and try an opana the legit way for the very first time, got FLOORED by its GREATNESS.

1xc8nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1xc8nw/vision_on_the_nod/,18,https://redd.it/1xc8nw,sinisterskrilla,Vision on the Nod,"It was yesterday when I entered that god-forsaken ""abandoned"" house. After running home I stayed up all night to write this little memoir. I copied it onto ten USB ports and am am about to drve an hour away to pick up my bags of dope and scatter these across the town in waterproof bags. If I survive the next few days then this is just a crazy story, but to whoever finds this if you hear of a 21 year old kid or two going missing in the western part of the state please do something about this. My name isn’t important, I’m an addict but I’m certainly not delusional, I use heroin not meth and PCP.

The sun was a mere 45 minutes from setting. My sickness was only at about a 2 out of 10, so in other words I guess its more like I just wasn’t high anymore. That is the first sign of being dope sick - when the high winds down - isn’t it? I knew if I didn’t scrap the metal yesterday evening then I would have had to deal with ripping the copper, brass, and aluminum out from the house this morning.

It was a wonder I hadn’t tried to scrap the house yet seeing as I was in my third year using opiates, and second year of a pretty time consuming heroin habit. If my neighbor who supposedly owned the houses didn’t scare the shit out of me for so many years then I’m sure I would have done this before I pawned most of my valuables. 

My Dad knows I relapsed last month, but it seemed like he was done arguing about it with me. I knew him better though, this was just his slowly burning fuse phase, complete with a bigger explosion when it reached its end. And he says I’m the predictable one. I expected that I would have been kicked out of of the house when the next blow-up came, but I don't expect it to go down like that.

Before I get to last night let me tell you about Dale.

My neighbor Dale was a nice enough old man most of the time, but with a hell of a temper. He used to let us neighborhood kids play in his yard throwing crab apples at each other and playing touch football. Until the day my best friend Jamie threw a ball through his garage window, Dale was always in that fucking garage with the blinds shut.

“Goddamnit you kids, I let you play in my yard and this is the thanks I fucking get?!?” 

We were eleven and twelve years old so we weren’t shocked to hear him cussing, but the way he yelled at us is what I’ll never forget. He was so filled with hate and pure rage, it was like nothing I’d seen at home or in school. His rant was much longer then that but that isn't important. Needless to say we all ran back to our homes. Usually we’d have kept our mouths shut and waited for the inevitable angry phone call, but this time it seemed like a better idea to just tell the truth.

My Mom never did like us kids playing in his yard, but Jamie’s parents didn’t give quite as much of a shit about what he did. I guess my Ma figured more strength in numbers, plus he *did* seem nice. He was a widower which made the street pity him to a degree. She yelled at me for being so careless in his yard. When I told him about Dale’s yelling she just said “Well imagine what he would do if you went up that hill onto his property, you know he’s told you all not to. Listen to me son, and listen carefully, please never go up the road.” The pleading in her eyes underscored the importance of the request to her and I made a promise. My Mom wasn’t the kind of person to go from angry to totally sincere and gentle in a heartbeat so I took the message to heart. I can’t say she didn’t make me curious though.

It turned out to be the longest promise I ever kept in my life, promises kind of go by the way-side once heroin is in the picture. Its not that I meant to break all those promises, but it just, you know, it just happens.

The Moms and Dads of the neighborhood all talked to one another about Dale and that’s when us kids got our first cell phone. We shared it amongst ourselves alternating who took it home every week, Jamie was the best at texting girls so after a while we just let him hold on to it. He even got a few nudies from this cute girl we all knew. Damn he was a hell of a wing man back when we tried.

I live on a dead end street, a *long* dead end street. Its a relatively steep hill that's blocked off with a big metal gate which I only saw unlocked once in my entire life. Dale’s house was the last house before the gate. The road turned to shit a foot past the bars anyway. Its a dirt road so washed out its only passable by a giant lifted vehicle, like the one Dale drives for what seems like no reason, besides his road he never uses.

My parents told me it was a logging road from the 60s, which made enough sense. That is until I heard about Google Maps when I was 14 years old. The road was about 3 miles long, but the weird part was there was no evidence of any logs being cut down anywhere along or at the end of the road. It was just a road… to nothing. 

I zoomed in as much as the screen allowed, and finally I was able to make out what looked like a small house under the heavy cover of a few giant trees.

I told my Mom about it and she said it was nothing and we’ll talk about it later. It was the middle of a freezing winter, there was no way I was going all the way up there now so she was in no hurry.

The next day my Mom was in a car crash. She was driving back from the neighboring town when she was involved in a hit and run. 

My Mom survived but she had head trauma. She was never the same bright and constantly curious yet rarely annoying woman who raised me. It was like what made her her had just been taken from us. She was suddenly in a constant state of fake looking semi-cheerfulness, she never knew exactly what was *really* going on around her, but she smiled nonetheless, and still does to this day. She just agrees and agrees and agrees with you. 

My Dad seemed to take it well, except for the fact that he began to bond with Dale, I guess it was my Dad losing his wife in his own way that finally helped him to understand Dale. They started to spend more times together tinkering with Dale's truck in the garage or whatever they did.

I didn’t cope as well as my Dad. I started drink that summer and by the time I was a senior I started to do pills. Lots of fucking pills, it was a hell of a time, glorious even. Sure I never wanted to get my friend Jamie involved but he was adamant. I refused until he told me fine he’ll just never talk to me again. I couldn’t lose my Mom and my best friend in the same year, so I finally relented and the rest is history. We started making the trip to the nearest city to get our pills, and we quickly graduated to heroin when the factors felt right - curiosity, low funds, and availability, the perfect storm.

Something strange started to happen a few months after I had moved on to IV heroin. I don’t know what it was about my nods that changed but I suddenly started to have weird experiences in the opiate God's arena between sleep and wakefulness. A user will know what I mean, they’re like dreams just different, more life-like most of the time. 

I began to nod and see my mother talking to me, I was scared but relished it at the same time. It gave me another excuse to use anyways; to hear my Mom how she used to be. I’m a lot younger in the nods.

I would be sitting in the living room. Her on the couch, me on the rug.

*“What is it Mom?”

“I don’t know what it is exactly, angel. I just don’t know if I trust Dale.”

“Oh, Mom, that happened years ago! He hasn’t so much as looked at us kids wrong since then, we don’t even play like that anymore, I’m a freshman in highschool, that’s all behind me.”

“I know honey, its not just him, this town can give me the creeps sometimes is all. Do you ever feel like that?”

“I don’t know… I guess once in a while, its like, well its like nothing ever really happens here, nothing at all, you know?”

“I do know. It does **seem** like nothing happens here hun. I think there’s more than what meets the eye in our little town though. You want to know what I think darling?  

“Please Mom tell me, I want to know, I wont tell anyone I swear.”

“Well it…”*

The first time I woke up I thought back to the time my older cousin came to visit us with his girlfriend. 

*“Your town’s weird man, its like its stuck in the past or something, me and Jessica keep noticing these looks, its nothing I’ve ever seen this far north before.”*

Jessica was my cousin Ricky’s black girlfriend. She was pretty and really nice. I thought he was crazy, its just a normal small town and he was used to the city.

That dream stuff went on once every few weeks for a couple months. More then anything I thought it was my self conscious reminding me of one of my last conversations with my Mom, the one we never finished. 

But I didn't really wonder about him. I was positive Dale was just a normal guy who's been understandably angry ever since his wife died. Hell my Dad hasn't been the same since Mom was in her accident.

I used to ask my Mom the first two years after the accident if she remembered our unfinished conversation. She only remembers a few things from before the accident, and for a while that wasn't one of them. After I had my nod-dreams I asked her again and she reminded me of the promise I made her nearly ten years ago. It only happened once and she hasn't said anything since then about it. My Dad just says its private property and not for addicts to tresspass on

I decided yesterday that I was going to strip Dale's little sketchy fucking house. Copper is light enough that between my buddy Jamie and I we weren't worried about carrying it down. Its two miles straight through the not-too-thick woods, and we have those little flashlight hats Plus after all these years the curiosity turned into a burning desire to explore that unknown area, promises be damned.

This is where things got fucked up.

I could never really get through to her the extent of my addiction problems in the past. She really just thinks my opiate addiction is just a party phase and that I need to grow up So it goes, not every body understands.

Anyways, so her and I are out for coffee the other day and I guess she's doing a project on drug addiction.  She's going off about Methadone and how horrible it is because it's ""The third most addictive drug in the world, right after cocaine and heroin"". (so she tells me) I try to explain what Methadone treatment is about and that you're really not getting hooked on anything new, just something that allows you to live a more sustainable, functioning and affordable life.  She starts going off about how it can be *kind of* good because heroin addicts can take some while their withdrawals are happening  so they aren't quite in as much pain (she was taught that heroin withdrawal is random and just pops up every once in a while for a while after your stop usign).  I tried telling her that with methadone your withdrawal symptoms are completely gone if you take the equivalent to your heroin tolerance and you actually get a buzz from it. She was like ""No there's no high and you still go through withdrawal"". I can't remember all of it but there were some other things that her teacher apparently told that were just not right. I tell her I've done extensive research on this subject obviously as I've used both methadone and heroin many times so while I may not know the brain science behind this I am an expert on the programs and different opiates. She wasn't having any of it because i'm not in Psychology.  I couldn't even get her to believe that drugs like oxycotin, heroin, and methadone give off the same high in different levels of intensity. She was like ""*I guesssss* in the same way that acid and weed are the same because they're both hallucinogenics technically... but it's a bit of a stretch.""

It's not that I was angry at her for not knowing about this stuff like I do cause I wish I didn't have to know this stuff, though I was a little stressed that she wouldn't listen to me. What I was more frustrated about however was the fact that this is all from her teacher who she said didn't even know acid was a liquid, she had to look it up online because she said it was a pill when a student corrected her. I just think it's important, especially in my area where oxycotin is all the rage with kids and later heroin, that the social workers are at least trained properly and know their stuff because they're going to be giving out a lot of advice over the years to young addicts or soon to be addicts that could maybe be preventable. My friend still thinks that methadone is used only for detoxing heroin addicts short term and to keep off to the side for days that they get these random withdrawals.",1391835222.0

I know all about precipitated withdrawal and why it happens. I was thinking about something the other day that really got me curious. Say I was an opiate naive person and I decided to take, let's say 30mg of Oxycodone. As someone with no tolerance or dependance (physical or mental) to the drug, that dose would probably get me good and high. Now lets say I decided to take an 8mg strip of Suboxone at the peak of my high. My question is, would that cause me to go into precipitated withdrawal, or would I just stop being high/probably feel like shit because of the relatively massive dose of Sub? Is precipitated withdrawal a factor related to being physically dependent on Opiates, or does it simply happen to all people regardless of their usage history/experience? I tried finding the answer on Google to no avail.

I am still sober. It made it round to payday, but i decided against scoring again in the end.

Figured I would see how long I can go without anything. No H, no opiates in general, no methadone or sub's.

Still having bad days over a month later, but I figured its been over a month now clean. So just gonna deal with them one day at a time.

I still miss my dope though, every morning I wake up I wish I had some. I could quite easily go score within 5 minutes, but I don't. I am a stubborn bastard and want to quit for my wife and son.

It would probably be easier if I wanted to quit for myself, but to be honest if I was single with no kids, I would still be using.

I guess liking dope is something that will never go, but I gotta do this for my family.

NarcAddict - 1 month clean.

Update 24h later:

Well gotta say, today is not as good a day as yesterday. From the moment I woke up, its been really hard. Nothing like yesterday, that was a nice easy day.

I am at work for the next 12 hours and I'm not looking forward to it. What makes it worse is I will be dishing out medication in about 30 mins, lots of strong opiates that I can't/won't touch.

I am guessing its these small things that are sent to test us.

I'm about 5 months clean of opiates, after several years of prescribed use.  No pain clinics near me, so have to wait until I move somewhere else.

I found some 12.5 mcg/hr Mylan fentanyl patches that I was prescribed many years ago.  They expired 3 years ago.

I'm in a lot of pain and am looking to hopefully use these to help me for a few months.

Several years ago, I was prescribed these when I was not opiate tolerant, and after reading up on them was concerned and called my Dr. who said it was no problem, these were the smallest dosage of them.  I think I talked to a pharmacy who must have told me it was ok too.  I tried them back then and it helped greatly with the pain, but made me fall asleep at work, so I stopped talking them.

So, I respect fentanyl's strength and will ask for some more advice here to go along with other inquiring I'm doing.

As someone who has went thru WD's many times and it was severe, I do not wish to go thru them again.  Do you think I could use one of these patches for 3 days, then wait say a week or so, then use another without having WD's?  Then repeating this process for a few months.  Any insight on how I should space these apart?

Also, because these are the Mylan patches (not gel) will I have no issue with say cutting them in half and using them?  If I cut them in half, I am assuming they will still release 12.5 mcg/hr but for about 1//2 the time?  Is that correct?  I have sleep apnea too, so that's why I'm a little more concerned.

Only interested in using them as patches, not chewing or smoking anything

So needless to say , I'm gonna run out very early, so I'm going to decrease my dose of vyvanse pretty quickly due to the fact I only have 450 mg left total. So, I was thinking, I just switched from sub strips 4mg to Zubsolv 5.7mg, which I believe to be a mistake on my doctors part, but if it helps me, I'd rather just stick with keeping the larger dose of Zubsolv. Do you guys think my larger dose of suboxone will help during my W/ds. And yes, I know the W/ds are very mild, however I work 6 days a week, 10-12 hours a day, with no breaks..

So I've been on Methadone Maintenance for just over a year, and obviously i don't usually get high off my dose. My dosage peaked at 70mg and is now at 50mg. 

Now I've looked into Methadone Potentiation quite a lot. 

So i've come up with a Extremely good way to potentiate Methadone, and perhaps other Opiates for others, but can't comment due to only trying it today. 

So 

8:00am - Took 40mg of Amitriptyline an tricyclic antidepressant (Endep) - Prescribed, which also potentates methadone.

Approx 2000mg (2 grams) Of Magnesium - OTC

And 100mg of Promethazine (phenergan) - OTC

8:30am - Went to the Pharmacy and dosed my Methadone 50mg

9:00am - 20mg of Diazepam (Valium), 600mg of Pregabalin (Lryica), 1mg of Xanax (Alprazolam) - All Prescibed along with 1000mg (1 gram) Of Calcium Carbonate (Tums) - OTC

Funny how all my prescribed Medication potentiates Methadone, Ironic? :P 

My prescribed medication doesn't really give me much of an effect as i have a high tolerance to Benzo's etc from longish use (Everday for over a year) Par from the Endep which i got prescibed for my Depression also potentiates Methadone... ahah

But with all the added Stuff, i have worked out a wonderful concoction, and feeling great! I'm sure this should work for most opiates, if taken orally. 

And just to let you know, i'm a former Oxy & Heroin IV user. 

Cheers. :)

Advice appreciated,"So the friend who usually sells me norcos told me he had a bottle of codeine cough syrup if I was interested. I was (having never tried codeine before) and so I picked it up along with the usual norc purchase. 

Was a little bit disappointed because he ripped the label off (mostly, I can still read ""Cherratussin Syrup"" on it) so I don't know the exact ingredients or the amount of said ingredients per ml. I'm guessing he did this because he was paranoid that if I got pulled over it would be obvious to the officer I had a narcotic if I was searched (I live like 5 minutes away from this dude *facepalm* but whatever.) <Edit: Thinking about it now I'm guessing it's cause his name was likely on the bottle ^^.)

All the sources I'm reading online say it contains guaf which I'm vaguely familar with because I learned to avoid it when I was picking up the basics of robotripping long ago. However a source or two mentioned pseudoephedrine (can't spell) was an ingredient as well? Is this true? Just for an older formula of this syrup? Not true?

My main question I guess is, how do I go about CWE and is it really necessary? Assuming 40mg of vicodin is my limit how much codeine should I be trying to ingest? And with said amount would you personally CWE? I'm not the type of person who's freaking about taking 2 grams of APAP on occasion (although of course I'd rather avoid not but being honest) so if you're the type who tells people to CWE 3 hydrocodones... I still value your input, but give me an idea of the level of risk you personally are cool accepting so I can... gauge... from there? <Another edit: I'm not even sure if CWE works for guaf?>

And I know it's easily found online but if someone wants to link a CWE guide that would be bonus points for you :). Whatever you thought was the easiest method for you. 

[Here is a picture of the bottle](http://i.imgur.com/4eTQQoD.jpg). I don't have a way to know the exact amount of syrup in the bottle but from the ml projection on the bottle (like, built into the plastic of the bottle lol) I'm guessing it's 120ml total. How many 30-40mg vicodin doses is that? Like 1? 2? More :D? (Guessing no though of course.)

Any help would be appreciated and I'm sorry but I'm high on the vicodin right now which tends to make me type a lot for some reason. :). For all I know this bottle could have been a waste of cash but I could probably return it if everyone is like ""lol n00b you bought shitty syrup"" because this guy is a long time friend so I'm not totally fucked or anything.

In your experience does buprenorphine block the euphoria more than the CNS depression? I want to get a full nod on but can't die. I actually like my life right now and am not going to switch back to banging dope every three hours.

My question is, what is proper positioning of the snorting device in the nose? I have read on one end that you should stick the bill as far up your nose as possible to direct the powder to the sinus, while I have also read that you should put the bill only as far in as needed. Obviously, I already know that regardless of positioning one should inhale as softly as possible to prevent bypassing the nasal cavity.

I've been contemplating just ending it all lately because I can't bare the pain. My parents could care less, my 'friends' pretend to care and my ex-girlfriend/best friend care rarely see me because her parents hate me because my family is poor. Then don't even know the opiate issue. I have nothing to live for. I figured I'd type this in case I do make the decision to call it quits. At least someone will know the reason why I did it. I might not go through with it, but this could be my last goodbyes. I don't have the heart to tell my ex but she'll find this if I do it. I don't want to leave people wondering.

If this is the end, I want to thank all of you for doing what you're doing. Showing people on Reddit we're more than junkies. Just know I'm not a coward I can't tolerate the pain, sleepless nights and depression any longer. I haven't been happy in years and I hate it.

Thank you guys for everything, maybe I won't end everything but if I do at least you guys know the reason.  I barely know you guys, but much love to all of you and I hope you all have great lives.

He gets good stuff--no denying that.  I've only copped from him three times in the past two months because I have been broke.  The last time I copped from him was like three weeks ago.  

Additionally, I've been recovering from an injury I sustained, so I simply have not had the will to go out and cop.  He still texts me when he gets new stuff, and he does almost everyday.  Now, onto the purpose of this post...

Today, he texted me and said, ""I can't believe you're not coming to me anymore.""  I was a little bit taken aback.  I explained the situation and he seemed cool.  I've never EVER had a dealer that says something that personal.  I've had dudes that will sit around and bullshit and chill, but I've never known one that wears their emotions on their sleeve like that.  Talking to him can be an emotional roller coaster.. The first time I went down to him, he gave me wrong directions, and then called me a BITCH for getting lost!  He accused me of getting lost ON PURPOSE!  I didn't want to call him out on it because I didn't really care, he hooked me up, and I just have no idea what this guy is going to do.  The thing is, he can be really cool at times--he'll give you shit even when you don't have the money, but he's a big baby!

Should I keep going to him (he hooks it up, and he can be super cool at times) or should I find someone else (he seems dangerously emotional sometimes)?

I find it really interesting to see where people are at in their opiate journeys! Sometimes I see opiate naive people on this sub, not understanding the dangers of the opiate lifestyle. This drugs can and WILL steal your life and take a giant shit as the cherry on top! I remember reading someones post knocking hustling for drugs. Saying they would NEVER steal, or the millions other hustles to get ones DOC. That reminded me of myself a few years ago. I was certain I was smarter than this drug. I desperately wanted to tell the person to get out of the game while he still could.  You will eventually will cross everything off that list of things you said you WOULDN'T do for Drugs! Any desperate junkie understands the reverse bucket list and the horrors that come along with it. Once again I understand the positives of a drugs like opiates. It cures all ailments in the short term.

My Question to you:

Do you hate or love opiates at this exact moment in time? Do you blame them for ruining your life or love them for their artistic ways. 

My answer to this question is pure hate, even with me being a little high. Opiates have absolutely ruined my life. It has drastically effected all aspects of my life including relationships, legal, financial, health, and more. Looking back I can attribute this shit hole of a life on opiates. But for some reason I keep coming back, even though I know recovery is the only way to save my life. For me the opiate life style will  only lave to loneliness, prison, or death. I AM PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE AND I AM TO COCKY TO NOT PULL THE TRIGGER!

I had been dope sick the last 2 days (unintentional). If you guys have read my previous post  you would know my credit card/debit cards were  stolen. Yesterday it finally showed up. I raced home when I got the news it arrived. I finally got that feeling of hope in my stomach. I could taste the high. I needed to make it to Bank Of America before closing time, because I was not giving a pin number (no way in hell i was waiting another 7-10 days for that). I make it home at 430, grab the card, and whip it down the street to the bank. To my horror it closes at 4 during the week. Just ridiculous 9-4 hours, how are working people suppose to do their in person banking?

I was out of options for the day (no suboxone/hustle),  just the dreaded waiting game. I decided to pound some Jameson, hoping it would scratch my itch. Of course it only made things worst.  I didn't sleep at all throughout the night, just focused on opiates.  At this point I am walking dope sick zombie. I drag myself to the bank, and to my surprised still fucking closed!...doesn't open until 9. 
I get to work and an email from my boss explaining how I have to create a presentation for the company Board Morning (needed to be done ASAP). I couldn't focus, too much anxiety Sweating, pain and shits. Let’s just say staring at financial statements did not look appetizing!  I had no choice but to leave work at 9 and get my fix. Finally a 150 dollar shot is in my syringe. The beautiful color of blue memorized my mind, and I could feel the comfort of an opiate high already. 

But of course with my luck I could not locate a vein. It was awful. Shaky hands and a tiny brittle veins  is a terrible combination. The frustration was starting to build, people were surrounding me, pounding on the public bathroom door. As a last ditch effort I try my wrists (hate shooting here), and the rig registers. As I start to push down the needle must have poked through. I knew I was no longer in the vein but I went for it anyways. I know it was stupid but the anxiety was destroying me. For one thing my wrist swelled up like a balloon. It was probably the worst missed shot of my life. It’s scary looking, definitely might have to get it checked out.  Anyways I didn't even feel high.  My question to my fellow IV users is as follows. Do missed shots still get you guys high? I was so frustrated....150 dollar shot leaves me a mountain on my arm but no high. 

TL;DR Missed a really expensive shot but no high. Do you guys get high when you miss a shot?

EDIT:

And now thanks to /u/jumpyourjacks I decided to take the scrapes shot. And wow this shit was good. Now that I'm high I'd like to tell a story. Yesterday I had been going thru w/d's for only a day yet had been feeling a lot sicker than I normally did. Only two days prior I was going through some of the worst w/d's I'd had in a while and picked up some really nice bags of a totally new dude. It took a little bit of time but the d was fire and the transaction was smooth. So naturally I decided to hit him up. In less than a minute he texted me back and I was on my way with a friend. So tell me why we sat there for 30 minutes while he doesn't answer my calls or texts. The fuck? So hopeless and defeated we drove home. I tried to convince him to cold cop but he wasn't about it. So on a tiny hope we decide to text some of his friends. lo and behold we had a savior. We copped and I got really high off the 5 bags I was given. Saving the scrapes til today, I am(was) now sitting with a rig full of maybe 1-2 bags in scrapes(i purposefully don't pour all the bag out to save for later =D. Now I'm just waiting on my friend who is dropping off 3 bags in an hour or so. But until then I'm watching my favorite of heroin movies... Panic In Needle Park. Happy nods y'all.",1392138335.0

I open the bottle of vicodin and took 4 of them right off the bat just so i can make this pain go away. 45 mins later i was on the computer and the pills kick in and man i was feeling so good, pain was gone and all i can think about was happiness, i was in awwww for the littlest things i would read or see on the internet, music had me tearing up, and i missed my mom and all my friends because i was going to school out of state in Santa Clara.  So i am calling everyone to see how they are doing, talked to my mom for like 2 hours about up and coming holidays and plans we can make for vacations, it was crazy.  During this whole time i am popping 2 more then 1 more, then back to 2 more lol.  They were the 7.5 and i have 90 of them.  So i told my self i am gonna take these every day til i run out.  Then the day came when i had no more.  I woke up sick as a dog.  I was like fuck i must of ate something or caught something.  I take a shower and that made me feel ok, but then i put on some clean freshly washed cloths and that shit made my skin crawl, my skin felt sticky, i was like what the fuck is wrong with me.  I call my mom asap and she tells me to go to urgent care.  I get there and tell the doctor everything.  This is not the same doctor she was just a pa at a urgent care.  She told me i might have a flu.  i was coughing real hard when i got there.  She then hands me a few papers that were my scripts.  She then starts to tell me.  I am prescribing you an antibiotic and some cough surup with Hydrocodone in it.  I asked hydrocodone does it have weed in it (i know dumb young ass kid lol) She laughs and said no, its the main stuff that's in Vicodin.  So I go on my way fucking sick as fuck starting to get a little depressed and wish i was back home so my mom can take care of me.  I pick up the meds and go home.  Right when i get home i crack the bottle of cough syrup and chug and good gulp, because my throat was on fire. and low and behold 15 mins later i was feeling like heaven on earth again. no more sickness but even higher then i was on the pills. ( the syrup was the 10mg per tea spoon)  I call one of my best friends up and told him the story about getting sick. He laughed and said ""Fool your ass was in WD, not a flu""  I was like WTF.                ",1392279885.0

My good friend (thanks again man) helped me out with some short tipped new rigs, but long story short I just couldn't register a shot.  I have read multiple guides including the Manual for safe Injection as well as being talked through the process.  I'm sort of a larger guy, not fat but not skinny and I can definitely see my veins under my skin.  However, no matter how many times I tried sticking myself in a lot of different places, my shot would not register.  I would seemingly hit a vein and even sometimes feel the ""popping"" sound, but only air bubbles would enter the rig when I pulled back.  The one time I saw a little blood come in the rig, I pressed the plunger down but I think I missed because there is a large bruise-like thing that formed in that area.  Now both my arms (and even a couple places on my hand) are tracked up, and the spikes are now very dull.  If anyone was or is in the same boat as me, how did you finally register a shot?  Do any of you veterans have any helpful tips on hitting my apparently illusive veins?  Thanks for you help!

TL;DR at bottom. I first took opiates when I was 14. I just took two Vicodin from my mom's pill bottle and took them and went to school. I felt fantastic. I was talking to people I never do, making genuine connections with the people around me, just overall seemed like a better me. After this occurrence I didn't touch any opiates again until I was 17.
   
   
   Now normally I'm a very quiet person who doesn't talk much and I think it's related to some anxiety issues. My family has a history of mental illness. My dad is diagnosed as bi-polar and has tried about 15 different SSRIs and SSNRIS, my grandmother (who I never met) has been in a psychiatric hospital ever since I was born. My uncle was diagnosed with depression and my aunt was a schizophrenic. 
   
   
   I visited my doctor when I was 16 to explain the anxiety issues I was having. He suggested therapy because I was so young and he didn't want to put me on medication. I did the therapy for about a year but I came out of it not knowing anything more about my problems than I already did. The therapist even said that I was already self-evaluating myself based off of what I had told her. Essentially analyzing my own problems and trying to figure out how to get over them. The few new tactics they tried did not curb my anxiety at all however.
   
   
   The doctor who worked with her suggested that I might want to try an SSRI. I said I didn't ever want to take an SSRI or SSNRI. Here's the explanation for that. 
   
   
   After my dad was diagnosed with bipolar-ism he started trying different SSRIs and other drugs to help with the problem. He tried around 15 different medications without them working. During this time me and my dad started to grow apart, he seemed to be changing as a person. When I was younger I could confidently say I loved my father. During the ordeal with the SSRIs he went to a bar and threatened a lady with a fillet knife he brought from home. This was crazy to me as I had never seen my dad be a violent man. He was reserved and quiet but NEVER violent, never even spanked me as I was growing up. He was a different person, a walking zombie, no emotions, stopped talking to me, started showing no interest in me etc.... I stopped loving my dad that year. I started visiting him as little as possible because I did not like him. He was not the same man he was when I was younger and I don't think that just because someone is family that you need to stick with them. Blood runs thicker than water is bullshit. This happened about a year before this next incident. 
   
   
   I hadn't talked to my dad nearly all summer and I wasn't really paying much attention to it, I live with my mother, who is the only family member I can truly say has always been there and she is the most caring and considerate person I've met. Near the end of summer I'm primed to go back to school and my grandparents give me a call and invite me over for dinner. Cool. I like my grandparents, they're pretty cool and relaxed and they always make bomb ass food. When I get there it was far from what I expected. I walk in the door and head for the living room. My dad, uncle, and grandparents were there (also my parents got divorced when I was young so I don't remember it any other way). They basically tell me my father got addicted to crack for about 6 months. This is when I truly realized that I didn't love my father anymore. I had no real feeling of empathy or even wanting to help. Me and my dad probably talked for a total of 5 minutes even though I was there for 5 hours.
   
   
   Fast forward about 6 months and I ran into a supply of Vicodin again. I have a pretty good job so I was buying them and started taking them every now and then when I had a shitty day or when I just wanted to chill with friends. I slowly started realizing that this feeling is something I love more than anything but my mother, it made me feel less anxious and like fucking superman. I ended up binging away 70 Vicodin in about two weeks. I ran out, my connect ran out, and I was disappointed. I was able to find some here or there from wisdom teeth surgeries and broken legs and stuff like that but never a solid connect. 
   
   
   I was thinking about it a lot and I REALLY think that I want to use opiates for the remainder of my life. This doesn't scare me, I have good self control and I know my mom would help with addiction if it ever happened. Opiates seriously make me feel like the best I've ever felt in my life, they even take away my anxiety more than benzos. 
   
   
   For some background I've tried a lot of other things as well and I think they made me realize even more that I might be in love with opiates. (LSD, Mushrooms, 25b-nBome, 25c-nBome, DXM, synthetic weed, weed (which is my second fave, smoke pretty much every day), adderall, MDMA, xanax, and MXE). My grades haven't dropped since my drug use and it even improved when I'm on some drugs. I recently was offered a scholarship that would nearly pay for half of my 4 year college stay.
  
   
   I basically just want to hear some feedback from you guys. I love this community and I love talking to everyone here. Telling me to stop using probably won't work guys, I already had the realization that opiates are one of my true loves. They just make me feel too damn good to not use them.
   
   
   Random question at the end: Why can you make some drugs like meth and speed in a very easy way even at your own house and you can't make some opiates at home. I'm assuming it's because the precursors are poppy plants and they are hard to come by or are they really that hard to synthesize? 
   
   
   TL;DR: Young man realizes he likes the feeling of opiates more than anything but the love for his mother, it doesn't scare him but he wants some feedback on experiences or on how to keep things in check and not let it get out of control. He also is fine with the idea of using opiates his entire life, along with a myriad of other drugs.

   
   Edit: I'm slightly annoyed at the fact that everyone is saying I'm not listening. I REALLY am, I posted this to get information and stories and to talk about it because there isn't really anyone in my real life that would without me thinking that they are judging me. I thought that the people here didn't shit on people for no reason but I guess some do. Didn't want to feel judged but yeah.

   Edit 2: I am now realizing the reason it might sound like I'm not understanding what a lot of you are saying is because I am stubborn and hard-headed as shit, and when someone says that I can't do something I want to prove everyone wrong.

It's red, but also sort of brown. When I eat a booger, or string of snot, (omg gross I know, but I have to see how it tasted) it mainly tastes bitter like heroin and Dormin, rather than metallic like blood. Assuming that what I'm seeing is some part blood, is it a sign of something i should be worried about, or is it commonplace?

...so I work til almost 2am tonight but i did my last shot around 11pm, which means i know that I can make it til tmrw w/o getting more but figure i would test my luck anyways for the hell of it, and if it didn't work out then it wouldn't be the end of the world.

SO... i txt my dude around 1am to see where he's at, and he says ""Woburn, what am ru looking for"". So I say whatever he can do for $100 hoping he'd be in a generous mood and do 1g+, and that I could be there in 20min... I'm 5min away from his spot and I get the dreaded ""dont leave yet"" txt so I'm like not even sure if tonight will even work out, cuz he def has the best shit for reasonable prices but he can be flakey and sometimes bails altogether if the sale isn't big enough for him to waste his time (i know, kind of an asshole dealer-attribute, but i still like to do business w/ him)... so he tells me to go wait at this gas station while he takes a shower and that he'll hook me up with 2g if I can give him a ride all the way which is good news, even though I know i wouldn't get home til 4:30am at the earliest. Long story short (too late, lol), I scoop him from his spot in Woburn, and he tells me that he has blow too. So after I give him the loot for my 2g, I also toss him my last 10spot for a tiny bit of yayo too.

...I just got home 15min ago, loaded up a small shot of 0.2g - 0.3g and throw just 1/2 the $10 bag of coke in too, cuz I don't wanna be up too late AND i already drank plenty of caffeine @work... prep that shit, register on the first try (woohoo), bang-o-rama... and *holy fucking shit* is that some of the best coke ive ever done in my life! I am fucking tweaking like a maniac who can't sit still. I don't usually fuck w/ uppers but mixing them w/ opiates can be fun some times (in moderation of course).

1xvu39,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1xvu39/thought_id_share_an_old_guide_get_the_most_from/,3,https://redd.it/1xvu39,61OH,Thought I'd share an old guide (Get the most from your dope with a few cheap pharms.),"**Warning** Do this at your own risk. Its definitely not as dangerous as a speedball. Not nearly as dangerous. But IVing pills does carry a risk but usually when it becomes an abuse issue. Please read my post in it's entirety if you're interested. It's very informative and I took a bit of time out of boredom to write it. I know longer IV heroin or anything (besides Ambien now and then, that's a whole other awesome experience.)

----------------------

This has the potential to make your dope better, last longer, and is perfect for at work or school when you have to socialize. So give it a read.

----------------------

Since I no longer use heroin I often give friends tips on how to make their high last longer, be stronger, etc. Without you know adding fent or benzos into the mix. When I first started shooting I came across a godly combination. Heroin and Ritalin (methylphenidate). 

**Please Note:** Combining drugs should never be considered fully 'safe' but due to the fact Ritalin is *not* a CNS depressant you don't have to worry about your breathing slowing down to the point of respiratory depression. And you also don't have to worry about it being as strong as cocaine, because its not. Thus reducing the risk of overdose since its potentiator value is a lot lower than cocaine.

----------------------

**First let me give you some pros and cons about this.**

* +It makes shitty dope better and increases the length of the high in my previous experiences.

* +The comedown is minimal compared to that of MDMA, cocaine or types of amphetamines (i know cocaine isn't an amphetamine, lol.)

* +Methylphenidate is a lot more water soluble than amphetamines like Adderall and unlike crack (not sure about cocaine) you don't need vinegar or a type of acid to break it down for IV use.

* +Methylphenidate is almost **NEVER** tested for on drug tests. Pre-employment? Nope. Probation? Nope. It's not even available to test for with home panel tests. Even labs that do random drug testing for companies and criminals don't test for methylphenidate. For example in PA most probation and judicial systems use a company called SASSI to drug test you if your crime was drug related. You're assigned a color, and you need to report for a urine test when your color is called. You fail, you go to jail. Methylphenidate will NEVER be tested for in office for probation and from the tons of research I've done on tests, lab tests, FDA and DEA approved drug tests none of them test for methylphenidate. Is it possible to test for yes? Do they? Absolutely not. Just like they don't test for shrooms. So would you rather do a bag of dope thats out of you in 2 days with a single use and use Ritalin or take the risk of cocaine showing up? I think we know the answer.

* +Ritalin is easy as hell to find and cheaper than cocaine. Hell you can get 20mg tablets online very easily for hella cheap.

* -Injecting any pill is not a good idea, they aren't meant to be injected and your veins weren't meant to be injected with pills. Doing it here and there isn't going to kill you if you be as safe as possible.

* +Unlike IV cocaine or crack Ritalin isn't as intense. You don't get drenched in sweat and puke. And Ritalin lasts longer when shot with dope and vice versa with the dope.

* -Don't shoot Ritalin on a daily basis or even do it more than a few times a month, you can develop some adverse health effects that can be serious. With abuse you'll be damaging yourself without even knowing it.

* +The Ritalin isn't speedy either, its weird how it works. When you snort Ritalin you get speedy, jaw clenching, etc. When taken orally almost has the same effect but more of a study aid. But when taken IV it seems like a totally different drug. I've never done cocaine but a lot of people I know say it feels identical to IV cocaine or crack but lasts a lot longer. And when you shoot Ritalin alone its a tad speedy at first but then its very euphoric and can make you nod on its own.


----------------------


I'm going to explain this as if you guys know about speedballs. You know how the cocaine intensifies the rush and makes the dope stronger and last longer the cocaine feeling however subsides after a short amount of time?  Well methylphenidate is like that. Ritalin's chemical structure somewhat resembles that of cocaine. Hence why it tends to be more social then stimulants like Adderall or Dextroamphetamine (same thing?) Anyway, if you know anything you know banging any pill is dangerous so please know what you're risking when you do this. In my opinion its safer to shoot generic Ritalin then Adderall IR or Adderall XR. Simply because they contain a lot more fillers and those beads in the XR's are a bitch. And plus most Rx amphetamines blow dick via IV. Back when I was shooting up I've tried trust me. MDMA is the only stimulant worth IVing. (Never done crystal, never will.). **ANYWAY** since methylphenidate is similar to cocaine it should make for a nice speedball correct? In my previous experiences YES. Keep in mind I've never done cocaine but I prepped a shot for a friend who does speedballs and he actually prefers the Ritalin+Dope combo. So I'll type up my guide below and give it a shot. Be safe guys. Don't go above 20mg of Ritalin, PERIOD. It can get scary.

----------------------

* First, get yourself some dope. (Obviously). If its mediocre dope the Ritalin will make it better, trust me.


* Second get yourself some Ritalin. Make sure they're IR (instant release). 10mg or 20mg will do fine. If you're nervous start with 10mg. I used to personally use these guys below:


**Generic 20mg:** http://www.drugs.com/imprints/sz-790-11265.html

**Or these (same thing basically):** http://www.drugs.com/imprints/5884-dan-20-6934.html


**Why use generic?** I don't know, probably because less filler. The pills are noticeably smaller which means less filler and if you don't have a wheel filter this is good.*

*IIRC (Someone validate this for me) they do make capsules with pure methylphenidate in it. Maybe not pure but it certainly contains less fillers and since its in a capsule it does not require a binder.



* Now we wanna crush up the Ritalin pill as finely as possible. To a powder. What I do is take any dollar bill fold it 'hamburger' style (90's kid term I remember from school.) Then I would take a lighter and crush the pill through the dollar bill with the bottom of the lighter. Note that I'm not actually making contact with the lighter to the pill. This will crush it down to chunks. Keep the bill folded  and (assuming you're a real man/woman and are using a Bic) just roll the lighter over the chunks under the dollar. Like roll the lighter with the angle of the Bic. This will make it a nice fine powder.



* Afterwards empty your powder into a spoon (Yes a spoon, it works best. Just use it, using a syringe cap for pills is a disaster and usually results in clogged rigs.) With a CLEAN, new rig draw up about 70 units of water and add it to the spoon with the powder. This is plenty. I recommend using no less than 45 units for best results and to get the most of the Ritalin out.



* Filtering. Now if you have a wheel filter go ahead and use it. I rarely used em when I did this back a few months ago. Just use a slightly bigger than average cotton ball filter and draw up. When you see the liquid basically all drawn up flick your syringe? Do you have close to 70 units? Of course not, if you use 70 units you should have 50 units of solution. If you don't just keep trying to get the water out of the cotton and spoon. Add another 10-15 units to the spoon with the same cotton, stir it up and draw up again. Feel free to do this as much as you'd like but leave at least 30 empty units in your rig. We need this later.



* Once you feel content with your Ritalin solution squirt it someplace. I like to squirt the solution into an extra syringe cap. (Not the needle cap for fucks sake, the plunger cap. Lol.) and set it aside. Now with a new plunger cap add your dope. Keep in mind this will intensify your dope and possibly make you nauseated. If you do 4 bag shots of ECP, stick with two to test the waters. Unless you get bad, bad dope then go ahead with 3. Do NOT use your normal amount. You never know how you may react. You can always re-dose but you can't un-dose.



* Add your dope to your cap, and 30 units of water. Or however much units you want and have left. Make sure you have enough for the Ritalin solution! Which I recommended 70 units. So use 30 units of water. For ECP you only really need 10 units per bag anyway if its good dope that isn't cut with something non-water soluble. Stir it up with your plunger, add your cotton and draw up. 


* Now you have a syringe with 30 units of dope solution. As an added measure throw a regular sized cotton filter into that cap with the Ritalin solution. Just in case any particles made it through or in case any were in the cap. Now draw up. You should have a perfect full syringe. If not, flick it and draw from the cotton again. My old rule of thumb was to draw up until I hear that hissing sound and bubbles come up the rig.


* Now to hit a vein. Use a FRESH, FAT vein. Don't make banging pills a habbit to begin with but if you're going to try this do it as safe as you can at the time. Example use the vein that runs on the bottom of your forearm. Its huge and easy to hit. For novice users it can be difficult but you can manage. You do NOT want to miss. A single missed shot or a little miss isn't going to kill you if you followed my instructions but a missed shot is never good for your veins, skin, or body. And worst of all its a wasted rush. 

* Go ahead and insert the pin into your vein of choice, make sure its in. ALWAYS register. If you go in to far but think you're in make sure your plunger is pulled up a little and pull back SLOWLY. If you are in a vein at a certain point you'll see blood rush in. STOP right there and keep the base of the rig static. (Still). You're ready to shoot. Slowly inject but remember to keep the actual syringe still and steady. To reassure you're in stop a few times during mid-injection and re-register. Did you get more dark blood? Good, you're still in and you're about to have a blast. If at any point you feel it burning or see a bubble forming go ahead and pull out and just re-do it. If you need to add a little more water so you can see registered blood easier. If you're shooting up and you shot up 80 units and on the last 20 units it starts to burn its up to you, skin popping (missing) that last 20 units isn't going to kill you and if you're healthy you'll fight off any bacteria WELL before you even get a chance of an abscess.

I even like the discofort, but it kind of feels like my muscles are getting a  painful massage that makes me feel amazing and at the same time causes discomfort.

I swung into an Amish Food store on a whim and began my search. 
At first, there was only a very nice older guy behind the counter. He was
just trying desperately to sell me something, anything. The store has not been open for very long and from what I could tell from my conversation with this nice guy they were not making much money. I soon found out why. I bought ten pounds of organic poppy seeds for $4.75 + tax. 
I also bought various tasty snacks & treats for next to nothing. When I walked out of the store I had 8 bags of snacks and poppy seeds and my total was $32.87. I kid you not this stuff would have cost me $90 at Wally World. Now to get to the point of my post, the store owner walked in as the nice old guy was ringing up my goodies. He walked over and shook my hand, nope not Amish. No beard or sweet hat. I was a little bummed I admit it. Anyway he saw that I cleaned him out of poppy seeds and immediately looked and me and asked, ""That's a whole bunch of poppy seeds!  You aren't going to take them home and smoke them are ya?""  I truthfully told him no. I didn't intend on smoking them. Obviously I was going to make a shitload of PST. He then laughed and said hell I don't care what you do with it as long as you come back and buy some again when I raise my prices next month. Haha I saluted and said yes sir see you next month.

Every dealer has ""crazy fire"", or ""I swear it's like China white bro that's how good it is."" 

We got home all excited and the boyfriend starts cooking. I tie off and he presents me with a curiously clear shot. I asked him how much was in there and he said we'd be getting a .15 each dose. I called him crazy and told him we'd do half and half and see how it goes. We've done .2 shots before with his other product just fine but I never blindly sample new gear with a dose higher than half a point, it's a rule for me. 

He registers just fine and gets a little less than half in my arm before it hit me like a freight train. 

I hadn't felt that laid out since I first started opiates. So glad I had laid out that rule that had saved my ass twice now, we settle in with a cigarette and take a grand voyage to Nodsville. 

We're cuddling and smoking one of those cigarettes that is just blowing your mind, so delicious and satisfying and I'm swimming in a lake of honey and tequila and velvet blankets when I dimly feel the sensation of warmth on my arm. 

It grows. It becomes hot. I finally break the surface of consciousness and I scream. The boyfriend's cigarette, long forgotten, had dropped embers that had been burning it's way through my arm as I was basking in the afterglow of opiate orgasm. Major buzzkill and a warning to fellow nodizens of Nodoplis; beware the power of the nod, or you may end up with a hole in your arm. 

TL;DR: The shit was fire, second degree burns, my arm hurts.

In fact, I hate it.","I see so many folks wishing people happy nods, and so many of my dope fiend friends get high, plant themselves on a couch and burn holes in their pants for the next few hours. Opiates have the opposite effect on me. They give me so much energy. I always want to get up and clean the whole house. I can't IMAGINE sitting there with my eyes closed for hours. It seems like such an extreme waste of a buzz. The few times I've gotten my hands on opiates that were powerful enough to make me nod (the two off the top of my head were IV fentanyl and big shots of oxymorphone), I hated it. I hate not being able to keep my eyes open and focus. I don't see how that's enjoyable at all. It felt like a complete waste when I came down and hadn't moved or accomplished anything for 3 hours. Opiates make me want to get up, clean the whole house, clean the car, bust ass at work, and they desensitize me so sex lasts way longer and feels better. 

For those of you that do nod, why is it enjoyable to spend so much money to basically fall asleep? How can you even enjoy your buzz if you're not even cognizant of your surroundings? I don't mean to insult anyone with this post, as I know I'm in the VAST minority. I'd just like to understand a little better. Anytime I've nodded from dope it was always from doing too much and I always end up kicking myself when I come down for not being able to enjoy my buzz. I've even got one friend that only gets high before he goes to sleep. I understand the feeling of withdrawaling and not being able to sleep, been there many times. But this dude specifically gets high just so he can smoke some weed and crash. That seems CRAZY to me. But to each their own. Please don't take this as a knock on those of you that frequently/enjoy nodding, I'd just like to get your perspective on things. ",1392328618.0

Having something implanted in me that completely blocked my ability to get high would definitely make it easier to stay clean.

So a little back story, ive got this friend (a non user, but alcoholic) who i actually dated for a while. But low and behold she was a sociopath and a complete asshole to me for the whole year we were dating. We broke up and decided we would still hang out and be cool with each other. Well this fall shes been trying to change her life for the better, trying to to drink as much, not manipulating people, and trying not to be such a uncontrolable nymphomaniac. We make a bet (with a couple of friends there as a witness) that she cant have sex or oral for a entire year because she is so super positive she can do it. So i take the bet for 200 bucks because she so confidant that she can be this ideal person she wants to be. Fast forward to 3 weeks ago she tells me she caved in and had sex with this dude. She says she can pay me for it on the 14th of this month (tomorrow) and im compassionate and understand. I get it bills and rent was due for that first week she got paid so i let it slide. I ask her today and basically she tells me to go fuck myself and shes isnt going to pay me. I told her i was planning on using that money for bills and shit because my work has been super slow. She then proceeds to fucking tell me that i need to watch how to spend my money and dont need to be buying drugs like some hollier than thou bitch. It just fucking hurts to be fucked over by a good friend that youve done nothing but help. I mean the whole time we were dating i paid fo fucking everything and even took her to the bahamas on my dime and never asked for anything in return. Sorry this has nothing to do with opiates but you guys are myfavorite community.

Tl;dr: one of my friends made a explicit bet and then tells me to go fuck myself after ive done nothing but help this person. What a dissapointment in someone you consider a friend. Sorry that was longer than intended.",1392320853.0

Here is my experience with using while on the shot.

Day 18: Snorted 4 bags (didn't have a needle). Felt a little bit high, but could have been placebo. The feeling also dissipated quickly.
Day 20: Shot 2 bags, felt a decent rush, and a short lived buzz.
Day 21: Shot 3 bags, great rush, almost threw up, had to lay down for a bit.
Day 25: Shot 2 bags, and then 3 bags a few hours later. The naltrexone has officially worn off. I was mindfuckingly high from both shots.
Day 27: Received 4th vivitrol shot. Decided to try my luck with 2 bags about 3 hours after getting the shot. A bit of a rush, then nothing.
Day 1: Shot two bags, nothing.

So starting about day 20, you can get high. Snorting won't do shit, you have to IV. The weird part is, on the days I didn't have dope, I didn't obsess about getting it. Ordinarily, when I'm not on vivitrol, every waking thought in my brain pertains to dope. I think the naltrexone definitely played a part in this. Also, I had no precipitated withdrawal symptoms upon getting my shot. It was about 36 hours from my last use to my vivitrol shot. Vivitrol allows me to get high a few times a month, not let myself become physically hooked, and live a normal life. Maybe I can finally become a chipper! Yay.",1392317185.0

In chemistry lab you may have used an alcohol-burning lamp.  It's a short squat glass bottle with a screw top, and a wick that sticks through the screw-on top.

You can use Everclear as fuel if you like to burn money, or go to the hardware store and get Denatured Alcohol for about 15 bucks a gallon.  Do not drink the Denatured Alcohol.

Don't use Isopropyl alcohol from the grocery store, because it's not pure enough.

You’re sitting across from her on the cold kitchen floor. She’s shaking with fear and you look in her eyes and you tell her. You want to hold her so bad but she has that thing about being touched when shes having an attack like this. Panic, fear, whatever it is. You don’t understand it but you try to. And you try to help her as much as you can even though everything that you have learned about how to help girls when they are upset does not apply in this situation. You do all of this as you nod in and out of dreamy bliss, trying your best to show her you care..while simultaneously basking in your own drug induced pleasure. You feel amazing. You try not to let this show as you force your eyes open and locked onto hers.  You say in the most serious and sincere voice you can muster.. ”This isn’t fun anymore. We are going to stop..ok? This was fun at first.. but now it’s not. We are going to stop. We have to stop” You shake your head. She nods.

We had been doing bumps of dope and k for a few hours. We had been doing bumps of dope and k for a few days, actually. Nonstop. It was all fun and games for a while but this was the first sign that things were starting to go bad. And it wasn’t the last. It still isn’t. Things have just been getting worse and worse for you..but you have just come to accept that as part of your reality at this point. 

We continued as so for the entire month of January, it seems. Except we forgot about the k somewhere along the line. Because when it comes down to it you  know that it’s  the dope you have been in love with all along. The k was just a little bit of  powdered sugar sprinkled on top of your nods. 

We used to dance in front of the mirror on k all night and let our hands create...now we use those same hands to scrape bags, cut lines, and pray.

Back then we always took trips to go pick up together, the three of us. Like it was some kind of social outing. But now you cannot depend on anyone else’s time schedule to dictate when you go can go cop. You’re on your own clock. And it  is ticking. It’s every man for himself. Your intervals in time, once counted in days and minutes, have become stamps and lines. And those stamps and lines have a weird ability to bend time in such a way that days fly by yet you’re living in a slow moving haze. Layer by layer. That was 23 days.. Only 23 days ago. A lot can happen in three weeks, it seems. 

“This is the last time we are going to pick up”, we say to each other every time. At this point we know it’s a lie. But we say it anyway, to ourselves, because telling the lie has become a part the routine itself. You realize that the only time you even put gas in your car anymore is to go cop. You don’t go anywhere else, or do anything else. You’re spending more and more time all by yourself. And the beautiful landscape around you from which you used to draw inspiration, you can no longer appreciate through heavy eyelids. 

You get into your car today and the check engine light is still there. It’s not going anywhere. The little sticker on your windshield says your next oil change is due 6,000 miles ago. But you drive anyway through the rain and snow to go score.. adding a few hundred more. Your love in a bag that used to cost $10 now costs a few hundred more, too. The dollars disappear as you watch your life slip farther and farther away from you. Less than a month ago you swore up and down that you would never touch a needle, no way. Now it’s your second time shooting today. The promises you made to yourself, and them, crumble within its powerful grip. 

This isn’t fun anymore...but you can’t stop doing it.

For me, pills are readily available via a pain management script, and I KNOW that once I try h, I'm going to LOVE it.  I know I've got an addictive personality to begin with, and pills are a lot easier to explain to my SO than a rig would be.  Once I try h, that's probably what I'm going to stick with for a while.  Plus, if I get tested at my doctor, I don't want anything else in my system but what he's prescribing.

Could use some advice and/or commiseration.,"My boyfriend has never so much has smoked weed in his life. He's known about my past opiate use but I told him it was completely behind me. I've been keeping my binges (which happens once every 3 or so months) a total secret.

I don't really want to go into detail as to how he found out, but it happened a week after I lied to him and said that my mysteriously missing money wasn't going towards drugs and I was done with that stuff. I cried a lot about how I was depressed and even agreed to go to the gym with him to prove that I was doing something with my life. So basically I had already promised him I wasn't using and wouldn't use ever again - and then the next week he catches me in the act of chopping some lines up right before bed. He's pissed and upset and worried, but he's also a really wonderful guy who loves me and he made that clear as well.

I feel like total worthless garbage. I cried so much tonight over the prospect of losing him. He's really all I have. But part of me is also resentful of how naive he is about drugs - if he had any clue how opiates felt he wouldn't be saying shit like ""If you loved me, you wouldn't use drugs"" because he would know what an irrelevant sentence that is. And now I'm in a position where I desperately want to keep my relationship and make amends but the idea of quitting forever isn't appealing to me - and I think that pretty much shows I have a problem regardless of whether or not I'm physically addicted. My boyfriend requested that I get help, so I emailed a few therapists to set up appointments. I really need someone to talk to as the root of my drug use is in anxiety and depression. I just have so much going for me that I can't fuck up like this.

Can anyone relate? Thanks for listening, anyway. 

Edit: Thanks everyone so much for the heartfelt responses. It means so much to me to know that others have gone through the same thing. Things have mostly gone back to normal and my boyfriend has made it very clear that he wants to stay with me and support me. I scheduled an appointment with a counselor. I'm going to focus on being sober, going to therapy and trying to find contentment in my life outside of drugs - all things I was meaning to do anyway but never got around to. He's given me a second chance, so I can't fuck it up.",1392545954.0

Gettingdrunkwithjesus here. Due to the good response I got on this idea from [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1y03cn/another_member_has_left_us/cfga2a6) I made this account and thread to develop this idea and hopefully make it work.

The idea is to create a system where users are paired with a buddy who they check in with on a given basis. Because we have lost quite a few members and lost track of probably ten times more I think it would be a good idea to have a system where we can keep tabs on each other. If we lose track of a member the idea isn't to immediately assume they died, but rather to keep tabs on each other as much as possible in case something does happen. 

The way i'm thinking it will work is that each person who wants to take part will PM me with an email address (or would it be better to just PM through reddit?). The member will be assigned another member (maybe in a different state to promote privacy?) to introduce themselves too and give a little information about themselves. On a given basis (maybe once a month) the members will check in on each other and see where they are at. If your buddy goes MIA you will be issued a new one. Hopefully if this works we, as a community, will be able to keep track of our users and know if anyone goes to jail, gets clean, or disappears. I hate the idea of someone who has contributed to this community and their legacy just disappearing forever. That's what has spawned this idea. 

I would love any input on how to improve this idea as well as any concerns. Any little personal information provided will obviously be stored in an encrypted file. On top of this I am thinking I will have the details to this account on an automatic forward to other trusted members so that if anything happens to me the program will live on. 

Sorry this is kind of a rough draft of my idea, I just want to gather ideas and hopefully figure out a way to make this work. Thanks everyone.

New blood here. First off.. Love this sub. As a whole, you all seem like a great bunch of people. The stories, discussions, tips, and personal experiences you all have shared have been invaluable to me during some incredibly difficult times. So thank you for that.

So. For anyone who's curious.. Here's a bit about me:

I'm a 22 year-old college girl, living outside of Boston and working part time. Relatively high functioning for a heroin addict, I think.

My relationship with opiates has been off and on for about six years. Like many others, I started off playing with pills in high school. I experimented a bit with other drugs, as well, but nothing ever stuck like opiates did.

Things starts to get real in 2011 when a very close family member of mine passed away. She was in a lot of pain towards the end so she was prescribed pretty much every painkiller known to man. Percocet, OxyContin, Fentanyl, Hydromorphone, Methadone.. You name it.

We lived together so when she passed, **all** of her meds were left behind. Nothing worked for her pain so I had months and months worth of meds stockpiled. *Sigh... Those were the days..* It seemed like I had an infinite supply. I assure you, I took **full** advantage. Amazing (and a little sad) how quickly I burned through them all. I was pretty good at keeping physical dependency at bay, for the most part. Psychologically, however, I was completely hooked from day one.

This year, when I shot heroin for the first time, I knew that was it. I was just too curious. I couldn't help myself. I just to see what all the fuss was about. Dumbass. I know. The second that needle registered, I fell head over heels in love.

I'm still not totally sure where I stand with it all. I know I'm an addict. I've accepted it. I've embraced it. But I'm sort of okay with it. Is that a horrible thing to say? I guess many of us tend to say things like that at first. That is, until the shit hits the fan. But until then..

Glad to be here, and I look forward to getting to know you all.",1392526558.0
1y1cgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1y1cgy/a_letter_to_a_selectman/,12,https://redd.it/1y1cgy,sinisterskrilla,A letter to a Selectman,"Mr. Selectman! Mr. Selectman! I need you help!

Can you see what is happening to your town?  Why won’t you help us? I’m an addict and I’m afraid I’ve been written off, another statistic bound for the morgue or the police log. Why do you do this to me? I swear I want the help. Sometimes. But you see Mr. Selectman its just not that easy. It runs in my blood and its become a part of me but I swear its like you think that its all of me. 

I wish I could make you understand but how can I when you’re not willing to learn. You don’t want to hear about the disease or how we feel or what we want. You don’t want to hear about harm reduction or what we need. This town’s become vindictive and its people like me in those life-altering crosshairs. I know you speak about us at meetings in hushed voices, working your damage control us on page B8 and not A1.

I don’t think you know who we are Mr. Selectman but I can try to shed a light.

We’re sons and daughters, neighbors and cousins. We’re mailmen and bartenders, garbage-men and nurses. We're friends and acquaintances, husbands and wives. We're published authors and famous movie stars, trying to protect our image from the stigmas you refuse to deny. We’re hookers and bums, trying to cope with our habit or keep warm in the winter. We’re all the same and we’re all so very different. We all came into this world but some came in on the top floor, others on the bottom, most somewhere in between.

I know you can’t wrap your head around it, how we got ourselves in this position. Some come because of pain, some come because of a trauma. Others come from curiosity, most of the curious finding fake security starting with a pill. Your drug educations lied and lied and once we knew that we thought we knew better. 

Regardless of the whos, whys and hows are we not still here? We might be missing a friend or a loved one but we’re still holding on. For now. But its so not easy! We struggle Mr. Selectman do we ever struggle, but its not an inherit struggle! You could help us so much if you only gave change a chance.

Some of us are just beginning, noticing the first creeping feel of withdrawal, or choosing a drug over an obligation just this once. The better feeling of today and the possibility of controlling that feeling sucking us in until we’re caught in our own snare. Its sneaky believe me Mister, it happens so fast.

Some of us embrace our habit. We refuse to try and re-enter the very society that’s ridiculed us, jailed us and arrested us! We hold a grudge that’s been shaped for years at the hands of the brutes who cause us more harm.
Most of us desire to quit our drug of choice, a desire that varies depending on the day or the individual. Its a scary thought and its often so tempting but such a struggle. A struggle to re-learn how to live life as it comes to us, to re-evaluate who we are and what makes us tick, to conquer the depression and anxiety that so often plagues us. 

Its not easy to lose an addiction, we’ll even mourn an addiction because it was the constant in their life, their one thing that was always there. Many of us have families who when we look at we just fill up with shame and a desperation to escape through the drugs we want to kick. It would be easier without the stigma, without the familiar looks and the condescending tones. The sneers and the judgment. The Police records we often carry are like a weight on our ankles, stripping us of pride and freedom, only to ensure difficulty if we ever do get the sobriety so many desire.

We’re not violent people, we don’t belong in jail. We sometimes do bad things and it’s no mystery why, but you could never understand why. 

Until you've been in that parking lot baking in the hot sun for 3 hours you'll never understand. Until you've held your rent money in one hand and your cell phone in the other praying you won't make the inevitable call you can't understand. Until you lay in your bed cursing your very existence and thrashing around like an animal all night then you will not understand. Until you've lost friends and family, whether for eternity or because they won't talk to you then you'll never quite get it. 

We’re addicts and we want more, more, and more. The illegal status of the one thing we desire makes it a very valuable substance. We don’t want to steal but we need to get well, we need to get well more than you could ever believe. The laws aren’t working sir there’s no numbers left to crunch. The prisons are full and they’re profiting off of us! Its common knowledge but you can stop it!  The departments and the task forces and the administrations exploit and imprison the vulnerable at the cost of taxpayers and the greed of individuals. 

Relaxed drug laws don’t create a country of devil worship filled with hate. It doesn’t create more addicts. I beg you to look at the other countries, the Portugals of the world who thought outside the box and helped those who were suffering. The statistics are promising and their addicts are less miserable. Help doesn’t strictly mean recovery. If someone isn’t ready for it why not allow them to flourish in the mean time with free access to their drug of choice allowing them more time to work a job or find a hobby and increase their self confidence which in turn will give them a desire to live drug-free. Maybe some encouragement and some group therapy to speed along the process. 

You can’t scare the addict out of someone with the threat of shame, jail, and diseases, how many more overdoses and incarcerated Americans does this country need to witness before the righteous among us finally come to our aid and stop inhibiting our detriment. Why must we keep the sale of drugs to the gangs and the greedy who infest our cities and murder our citizens. They ruin neighbors and futures and all for a quick buck. The drug dealers are false role-models for the young in the area who idolize their money and the false idea of a long prosperous life as a drug dealer. Why can’t we just say enough?

Just because we’ve fallen from society’s idea of a quality life does that mean we don’t deserve an easier path back to that quality lifestyle, a path filled with humanity and understanding instead of hate and intolerance. I beg you to consider the people you could help Mr. Congressman.

If only addicts could come together and demand a change. If only we had the voice of the other marginalized people in history who came together to improve the quality of their lives. We may not yet roar but  each of our willingness is eager to unite.

You have the opportunity to help a million people, we just need some political advocates. Its the right thing and a sorely needed change of stance from dehumanizing to acceptance. Practice what you teach and help your fellow citizens. Talk to your Selectman friends and a Senator you know. Be the change us people seek. Our lives depend on it.

Thank-you.

 For the last two weeks, minus one night last weekend and last night my friend (we will call him Joe) has been staying the night with me. For the first week I had no money so Joe supported my habit, it may not have been an all day high but he did get me high every day at least once a day. He took care of me. Well my income taxes came in this week and I decided I would take care of him this go around. I bought him pills all week. Their was only one day that he was sick for half the day and it was because my ass was too lazy to get out of bed. Well yesterday I ran across some opanas for a great price that I couldn't pass up and the guy that we usually buy from told me if I can get them for that cheap to just let him know and he can sell them and split the profit with me, so I split the pills I buy with him and let him do his thing, 45 min later I have made all but 50 of my money back and had I let him have one more to sell I would have got it back too I was just being pill greedy.

So later we go and pick Joe's Cousin Dave up at his house to come hang out and get high with us, while we are all sitting on my bed nodding out we hear a knock on my door... it's my ex boyfriend wanting to talk to me. I told them to stay in my room and I would keep him outside, I leave my pills in a little red pill box sitting on my bed... I have known these guys for years, I Trust them with my life plus they are so high they can hardly move so I don't think twice about not taking them with me. I am outside talking to my ex for about an hour when I get back inside I want to get high again, I start to look for my pill box where I left it and I can't find it, automatically Dave starts thinking of things that could have happened to them, like kicking them off the bed when I got up stuff like that. We tear my room apart looking for them and don't find them and next thing you know Joe gets on the phone trying to find someone to come get him and Dave and take them somewhere else. So I know that pills don't just get up and walk off without help, I know the bed don't eat them so that tells me they got them. Less than an hour later they start texting me asking if I will take them somewhere, I am pissed so I blow them off. Even today they have called me probably 8 times wanting me to hang out or come get them just stuff like that, I just keep blowing them off. 

Then on top of that, today I had a guy going to get me some more opanas and they were a pretty good price, I have dealt with this guy before. He has no car so I know he will have to ride with me, I have always gave him money sat in the car let him run in get my stuff and come back out and it has always worked out just fine, well today it didn't Work out that way he got the money, got out of my car and took off and I never seen him or talked to him after that.

 I am just so fucking irritated that everyone that I have taken care of in the past has fucked me over so hard this week.. it just amazes me what money and drugs can do to people you have known for years or pretty much all your life. I have never fucked anyone over like that and I just don't see how people can do it like that. Oh well what goes around comes around, all of them have pretty decent police records so their day is coming. I know that is harsh to say but I am just pissy right now. Anyway just needed to get all that off my chest, if you made it this far thank you :-) 

TLDR: I have got fucked over twice in two days, both by people who I have helped out a lot when I could. It amazes me how much drugs and money can change people.

The details are all very vague right now, so that's all I know.

edit: After reading through the comments, I just thought I'd offer a few more bits of information for clarification. DownNOut28 kept his use secret from his family, and what his brother told me was that they weren't at all sure what happened to him, only that he passed away on Friday.

His phone was going to voicemail since Tuesday (major red flag with him, as this never happens) until Saturday when someone charged it and his brother answered... I will be in touch with his family in the near future to find out what actually happened once they've had a chance to piece things together and lay him to rest. If you knew him and would like to know anything, I'd be happy to share once I know myself.

All that said while I don't think that assuming it was an OD is at all a stretch, it could have been any number of other things. People die every day from unseen ailments and things like that. However I'm certain with knowing what we do, we can rule out car accidents and all other such violent deaths in this case. Given the circumstances it's reasonable to assume this was an OD. That's all it is for now though, an assumption.

He was experienced with shooting, he always tested his batches, and I know he'd never do something crazy. I guess my point is that even the most responsible users who test everything and try to play it as safe as possible are still subject to the cruel nature of the beast.. you can never be too safe.

I had rolled into the car in front of me! Apparently I nodded out and took my foot off the brake just enough to roll into the car at what couldn't have been more than 3mph. The guy got out of his car to check out the damage and I got out as well to face the music. A million things were running through my mind like would the cop be able to tell I was high, if I had anything on me I didn't know about, etc. He looks me in the face angrily, looks at the tiny dint in his bumper, yells ""fuck!"", then quickly gets back in his car and speeds off fleeing the scene. I don't know what he was up to that made him flee when the accident clearly wasn't his fault, but it worked well for me!

My physical condition has recently deteriorated to the point where I can barely stand, drive, walk, or think. I thought some stress pushed the situation over the edge. Assumed it was my illness plus lack of sleep. My doctor took some blood and my cortisol level was that of an untreated Addison's Disease patient. The cause is now believed to be the opiates I was taking, which were zapping my cortisol and keeping my body from healing itself normally. No wonder I couldn't handle stress! I'll still have issues but much of my situation is expected to improve. I read a lot about the drugs I take, but had no idea they could do this. I took them as prescribed. I wonder how many people are suffering from this and don't know it. I receive a lot of top-tier medical attention and a simple blood test when the problem was starting might have saved my job and much of what I've lost in the last six months -- a lot.

Few weeks ago I drank a crushed up 80mg oxy and drank it and also barely nodded, so i decided I'm not going to do oxy anymore cause it's too expensive.

I don't have any contacts to get h and I'm not going to hunt it out, I'm at a stage in my life where I'm ready to make a few changes to improve my life and just wanted to get the most out of this last stuff so I decided to iv it. 

Took me 3 jabs before it registered and down went the plunger, not too much of a rush but getting so high so quickly was pretty nice I'm sitting in a park under a tree chain smoking right now it's quite lovely.

If I ever do this again it will be in at least 6 months, I'm setting some goals for myself to do to Improve my life and unless I work hard and do these things there will never be another shot.

Sorry about the small picture. I recently moved back to the big city from out west and was clean for a few months due to a lack of a hook up. Finally, after quite a while of searching, I was able to find a connect last week. Well, we had terrible weather today, so he was not able to help me. It had been 6 hours since my last dose before I decided, fuck it, I'm going to have to cold cop or be sick. I had never cold copped before, so when I got to the ""hood"", I had no idea what to really look for. I pulled into a KFC to get an Ice Tea. When I got out of the car, I looked down and I saw a sandwich sized black plastic ziplock bag. I opened it up and found 60 bags and just a bit over $1400. I swear to the opiate gods that I thought I was dreaming. As a matter of fact, I knew I was, only this was a dream come true. I grabbed the bag and jumped back in my car and got the hell out of that parking lot and over to a nearby hospital parking lot so I could fix. 

Guys... guys... this shit is SO fire. I did a bag and was on cloud 10. I hit up my boy in the far west burbs and drove over to him to throw him 5 bags because 

1.) He doesn't drive

2.) Even if he did, travel times were in the 2-3 hour range

3.) I was so happy, I just had to start doing nice things for people.

Sitting here tonight, writing this, is bringing back all the warm fuzzy feelings I got when I found that bag. Anyways, it's been a while since I've posted on here, but I guess I can check out any time I like, but I can never leave.

I've done lope before but not super doses. 16mg per day. it does help me but no sleep. 

I have some leftover xanax from a death in the family. pretty much a benzo virgin. maybe total of 6 weeks in my life on small doses. zero meaningful tolerance. 

so here is the question - I've found pdr entries saying not to mix benzos and lope because they compound each other, sedation-wise. 

I'm a one-chem dude. don't mic anything, ever. 

would 16mg and like 1-2mg xanax be safe? I know some of y'all bang bags and eat bars but I'm asking as a lightweight here. lope def makes me feel like I had benedryl.

Severe effect changes post withdrawal. Has anyone else had similar experiences (not just on PST, but any other opiate)? More info inside","So here's the deal. I have been a dope user for 7 years (first 5 in a row, a year of being clean, then the next two followed by my switch to PST). 


Now I've only been using the PST for about 3 or 4 months. I originally switched tried it to help with withdrawals, but have developed a fondness for it. When I make tea I use 3 pounds of seeds and do two washes of the seeds to make one serving. Now due to my high tolerance, this tea does not get me ""high"" per say. What it does is make me feel very positive, somewhat energetic, with a very subtle opiate-glow. I can feel the tea at work for about 8-12 hours, and towards the tail end of it, when my energy is coming down, I sometimes (rarely) catch a very brief nod here and there. 


Now on to my concern. I had been using the PST for about 4 months, day to day, no breaks. This recent snow storm messed me up though and I couldn't get seeds for two days. During those two days I was in a state of withdrawal. Now this withdrawal was no where near as bad as dope withdrawal, and if it hadn't rendered me so lethargic and I hadn't gotten restless leg syndrome I would have even considered it manageable. 


Well two days into the withdrawal I managed to get my hands on my seeds (same brand I always use, and as a side note the effects of this brand have always been fairly consistent). Now heres the interesting thing. Ever since I start back up on the tea since the withdrawals, the effects have been very different. I still get a very subtle opiate-glow, however I don't get the energy. Now it's like the opposite, I get very tired and I even get pretty noddy. The whole situation just seems very interesting to me. I don't think just because I had my first WD experience from the tea would cause the tea's effects to change like that afterwards.I know that seed potency very batch to batch, however the change is very drastic and I don't necassarily think that may be it. I prefer the effects I had originally as opposed to this very ""sleepy"" set of effects.


Has anyone else had a similar experience (not just with tea but any opiate)? Does anyone have an idea on what the issue may be?

My first real dealer when I switched from oc to h started out cool as always. I drove him around and he was hella generous. 6 months into running with him, call him A, it was obviously he was getting in deeper and his biz was suffering. Going femoral and all. I know it's stupid, but one day I let him walk off with 2o's of weed to sell. Surprise, he never came back.

I was sick for 2 days (no other connect) when he hits me up and apologizes says hell get me back yadda yadda. Im sick but im also pissed, but I get a g from him. I act like its back to normal. Literally a week later I am casually chatting with this lady downtown at a bus stop and we get to talking. She sells.

I started getting small bags from her and still hitting up A every other time. Quality is better, bags are cheaper. Then she offers me o's for 250. It helps her get more at a better price. She even leaves me collateral! Obviously I go that route. 

A starts calling me asking if I need more frequently. I finally tell him I got a line on good bulk. He buys some from me. Loves it. Wants me to buy for him.

""Sure man what ya want?""  Ill take 2 he says. ""Let me get that cash and ill be right back"". We bus there (my idea. Car was 'broken'). He hands me 500.  I walk off and never saw him again! Debt paid back almost to the penny. I was so amazed how that all lined up, and how I managed to play it!

Broke my rule about only using on the holidays, ended up prepping a shot to inject at the train station before I headed off to uni in the city and can unfortunately see myself doing it again. I've been binging pretty hard since December, spent nearly 2 grand on dope some how but did manage a few small breaks.

But yeah its funny how much easier it is to control your use when everything is going right, I took big breaks(months) without even thinking last year and now the week break I'm on is killing me, spending 22 hours a day in bed either watching shows or sleeping. 

I now need almost twice my old dose to get high and I dont want the dope to stop because my life is feeling shitty. I know spending all my money on dope the last month probably isnt helping me improve it by getting out of here but it makes things a lot more bearable. 

On the bright side I'll be getting some money to move out in march(government check for $1100! :) ) so just got to stay high till then haha....

Apologize in advance for the wall of text. I started IVing less than a week ago and despite what I thought about my level of self control...once I tasted that rush it was all over and I quickly became a ""greedy dope hog"" as tracey would say. I managed to shoot over 40 bags in about 3 or 4 days with the last 15 or so all being within one 12 hour hard binge I had with another redditor. I puked so much during that hard binge and just felt like such absolute shit that I figured the way I feel right now can't be worse than what going through withdrawals will feel like. So that sprialing out of control of my use combined with a lot of personal stuff in my life hitting the fan drove me to reach out to a few close friends and family members, inform them of how bad my situation had gotten, and throw in the towel ending this close to 2 month straight binge of daily use. 

I took my last shot at around 9:30am on Monday morning. By that evening I was already starting to feel some of the anxiety setting in. Thay same anxiety has always drove me over the edge every time I tried to quit and I would end up copping within 36 hours or having to take a sub. But I was determined not to cop so I chugged a bunch of Nyquil and passed out hoping to sleep it off. 

Woke up the next morning and the anxiety started to kick in hard. I was then past 24 hours. I managed to find a connect for some xanax which I hoped to use to curb the anxiety. Took 1mg around 1pm and it helped a lot but I hate benzos as they make me feel completely emotionless and also make me really groggy so I tried not to overdo it with those. Had to take another .5mg around 6pm because I started to panick again really hard I guess once the first one wore off. 

I was feeling really groggy from the xanax and wanted to pass out at around 10pm as I have a few things to get done tomorrow/ today (including a job interview for a new, better job). But as soon as I laid down the restlessness set in and I started to panic again. I didn't want to take any more xanax and wake up groggy so I caved and took 2mg of suboxone that I had been trying to hold out on taking. Waited about a half hour and was still in the same state so I took another 2mg and that did me right I guess as I fell asleep and just woke up about an hour ago. 

I'm feeling fine right now. Have a job interview today at 3pm so I don't want to take any more benzos and risk being groggy/out of it for that. So I'm just going to try to hold out and hope the 4mg dose of sub will keep me ok through that. 

If I get this new job I will be moving to a different area, closer to my friends and family who support me so I'm really just crossing my fingers that everything goes well with that. I already have my foot in the door at the company and it is a long term friend who will be interviewing me so I just gotta pull myself together despite all of this and try to be on my A game. 

I have another 8mg of sub to taper down on as needed but I'm trying to avoid using them unless absolutely necessary. Stocked up on lope even though I haven't had a problem yet but we will see.

I have a huge exam tomorrow in advanced corporate finance, hence the all-nighter. I absolutely suck at going to class for those in which professors don't take attendance in and this being one of them, I have a fuck ton of studying to do.

ANYWAYS, my girl/middle(wo)man texted me earlier this evening and said if I picked her up from school, which is five minutes away from where I was, and took her by the dope man's house, which is on the way back to her house and to my apartment, that she'd give me a free bag (a bag of unknown weight, not a stamp since we don't have those around here). I haven't really been doing dope lately, the past week or two, but i decided fuck it, i'm gonna see what I can get out of this bitch.

The last few times I've fucked with her have been absolute bullshit, which is one of the reasons I haven't really been doing dope lately. She's my plug, and it's just not worth it for me to fuck with her. So she knew she was gonna have to hook me the fuck up to get me to do anything for her. So after acting like it was such a hassle for me, she agreed to .4. I left from where I was chilling around 9, and I was home by 9:45. No shit, it's never been this quick/easy to go through her. I really don't give a fuck though because it was so easy this time and from what I've heard around this shit is fire.

So why, may you ask, am I so proud of myself? 
.........I haven't even opened the bag yet, nor do I plan to for a little while. Shocking, right? What kind of fucking junkie get a fat bag fo' free and doesn't do that shit immediately?! I'm gonna finish my all-nighter, geeked on addy, study my ass off, and ace the fuck out of this test. Then, and only then, will I experience that wonderful taste of heroin. 

I know this probably doesn't seem like a big deal to most people, but for me this is huge. I'm the kinda girl who can hardly even wait to get home to do her shit, and sometimes can't even wait to get home. But somehow, that bag of dope on my kitchen table really isn't bothering me all that much. I'm completely fine with waiting the 9-10 hours to get my fix. Granted, I did .3 this morning so I'm not quite withdrawing but still. Okay now i'm done rambling and back to studying. Happy nods darlings.

TL;DR: I picked up a free .4 of some fire and despite my junkie habits, I'm refraining from doing it until tomorrow after a huge exam. Yeah, I'm proud of myself.",1392785988.0

Blue 30's are the devil... saying that. So a little back story been using 2 years everyday... using 10 a day for a year. Recently have been in really bad money issues (maxxed CC's getting high, now have to deal with bills). I haven't been able to support my massive habit, so I tried to ""maintain"" with some opana 40 ER. I cut them into 4th's and try to take 1 to 2 of them 2-3 times per day. They seem to really help with the physical WD's but I feel absolutely HORRIBLE.

Even though I am not in physical pain, or really any physical symptoms, I feel like absolute shit mentally. It's impossible for me to get motivated, for anything! I sat at work for 7 1/2 hours (came in 1/2 hour late) and probably only did about an hour or two of actual work - and that came after I popped 2 quarters after lunch. The rest of the time was spent on my  phone looking at reddit or messaging various people throughout the day. The day drags soooooooooooooo fucking long. I honestly feel hopeless... 

I went to the DR. and they gave me zoloft and told me to talk to a psychiatrist. I told her how I felt but I left out the heavy oxycotin user part...

So my question: Is this a normal coming off oxy thing? Has anyone else experienced feeling supper depressed from trying to taper down use? If I was quitting cold turkey I might understand, but why do I feel SO bad just trying to taper.

edit: I have done this before, and was able to go 2-3 days with no problem (maybe it was because I was focused on EVENTUALLY getting high and feeling normal again). Just another reason I'm tripping...

Is this something that eventually gos away?

Yes, I know what you are thinking. ""But Narc, we went through this before, and you came to a good agreement"". Well, seems my wife lied a wee bit about her being happy, which didn't take me long to figure out.

He brought along this chick let's call her Cassie, I didn't know he had her with him and I was kinda mad but it was pouring outside and I wasn't about to tell her to kick rocks.

So she turns out to be a super whiny annoying bitch. I'm sorry, but she just plopped down on my couch and started bitching about how she was sober and blah blah blah blah. She didn't have any money and was trying to get us to buy her alcohol and cigarettes and everything. So she fucking drinks half my SO's 40 without asking and then tells him it was nasty anyway and that it wasn't a big deal. Then she took a couple of my cigarettes without asking too. At this point I was kind of pissed.

So then Bill gives her a shot to shut her up. Turns out she didn't have the 'tolerance' she thought she did and she starts falling out. I get over to her and start attending to her, making sure she's breathing and trying to wake her up. The whole time she's half-slurring at me to fuck off while she's barely breathing. God. Then she manages to crawl to the bathroom, pukes everywhere (even in the sink) and sits her ass back on the couch. 

The toilet is clogged, my apartment was fucked up, and she's still so messed up. We asked her to clean up her mess, and she throws a bunch of my very nice white towels on her puke and then eats the food that we had for US, for dinner. The whole time burping and farting and bitching.

Holy shit. Sorry for the wall but I am so, so pissed. Who does that shit?",1392774658.0

Current plan: do last .5 gram shot tomorrow EARLY like two hours before I leave for work then go to work. Come home and start popping benzos as needed.

Take Neurontin. I heard it works wonders. I have never taken more than a test to make sure I was not allergic. 

Take benzos and neurontin as needed then take Ambien for sleep.

Wake up (hopefully I'll have slept) and at that  point take more benzos and then take the sub at a dose of 2 mg then follow that with more after 30-40 minutes had passed since it went under tongue. 

Is there any chance I could actually pull this off?  This is a long standing habit that must end now. And work is not flexible. I could go to rehab and lose my job. I could go late and lose my job. But... I could show up sick to death and thus get the support necessary to take the day and maybe a few more off. I simply do not want to go anywhere as sick as I am 24 hours off...

(Long story in comments)","So as a lot of you know I've been dealing with some bullshit lately. I have my grandmother to take care of, which I put before getting straight. Always have. Always will. 

My sub script was not covered by medicaid as I mentioned in my last thread and I was just coming home from one last outing of the day trying to hustle up the funds we need. I was having a heated conversation with a friend, explaining things as I finished my cigarette before I stepped into the basement of my building ready to go upstairs, maybe do a little bitch crying and take some lope and try to pass out.

Suddenly, as I'm waiting for the elevator to come, a familiar voice echoes from around the hallway corner ""JAY?!? That you brotha?!"" as I heard the boiler room door slam shut and footsteps approaching, I honestly expected someone who could only make my situation worse, especially with the way things have been going as of late.

It was Gary/G, a homeless vet who lives around my way. He's been around since I was a little boy. We met one day when he saved my ass from getting jumped and having my basketball taken by some older kids. A couple grown ass man slaps ended that situation with the quickness, to say the least. We became friends and over the years I'd always help him out with any twos and fews I had growing up.

Once I was older and was working and/or hustling, I used to hook him up with money for food/booze or toss him a few stamps when he was looking sick, or a dub sack to burn, etc. Sometimes we'd smoke together and talk about life. He told me I reminded him of a kid who he grew up with who lived in my building named Jan. That's when I found out he knew my dad back in the day. I never told him though. I didn't have the heart to tell him his old friend was dead. 

He was always cool, though. One extra bad winter maybe 10 years ago, I found him outside and brought him in, gave him a blanket and some fresh long johns and clothes so he could wash his in our machines and have some fresh stuff to wear while he did so. I also gave him the boiler room key that I used to smoke blunts/chill in there sometimes with friends. 

I told him he could use it to sleep in there where it's super warm, so long as he made sure he was out really early in the AM before any maintenance guys came since the last thing I wanted was him getting arrested for trespassing. I left him and thought nothing much of it.

Of course I'd still see him around the way from then on until now, every now and then same as always. But I'd all but forgotten about giving him the key and I suppose he never thanked me or mentioned it again for fear that I'd take it back, who knows.

Turns out he's been coming in there to sleep on nights when the weather was too unforgiving ever since. I guess years of USMC training has him pretty well conditioned to waking up early so he's never been caught once.

Fast forward to tonight - I guess he'd overheard my conversation and recognized my voice and the subject matter because he risked blowing up his own spot just to come out and see if it was me. We talked for a few mins and I guess I was just flabbergasted that he'd been sleeping in there for so damn long, that by the time he'd reached into his pocket I wasn't even thinking about my situation at the moment.

""Here you go, kiddo.'', he said, as he dropped a stamp into my hand. ""ON DECK"" was the faded label. ""I know it ain't much b--"" I didn't even let him finish his sentence, I just hugged him and told him to wait right there. 

I went upstairs and got him some food but what I really came up for was to make him up a Tracey-style care package from what I had for myself from the needle exchange. I gave him everything I had for myself, save for one rig and a cotton for me to use his gift with. About 40 rigs, cottons, a handful of cookers, alcohol pads, blue steri-water vials, etc. He needs it way more than me, plus I'd noticed some abscesses when I saw him which is what inspired me to get all that stuff to begin with. So I threw in some Neosporin and a full bottle of clindamycin I had on hand to help him fight any infections/mrsa/what-have-you and sealed up the freezer bag. 

I rushed back downstairs and gave him everything and he was so happy he tossed me another bag. I was reluctant to take it but he said he'd had a pretty good day scrapping since no one else was really out so he had his pick for the most part, albeit after a bit of snow digging.

We chatted over a couple Newports and said our goodbyes. I went upstairs and he went back into the warmth of the boiler room for another night.

The bags were nothing special (I'm gonna see if he's around tomorrow night so I can give him my connect for stamps) but then again, it was well below my usual dose with my tolerance. The important thing is, I wasn't sick anymore. And won't be for hopefully 12, maybe 18 hours if I'm lucky. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text but it's the first time in what feels like forever that I've felt well enough to be enthusiastic about writing anything, so I decided to add in the backstory rather than just saying 'some homeless junkie I know gave me free dope yay' and leaving it at that. 

Just goes to show, even when seemingly EVERYTHING is fucked up, you never know what might happen. I'd say 'thank you Junkie Jesus' but really what I need to say is 'thank you Gary'.

So a few days back I sold an old instrument of mine and was able to get more than two grand for it, pretty lucky I know. I took $500 of it and deposited it and the rest I kept on me for dope and a PS4 for my little brother's birthday. I picked up A LOT of dope, even though I still had 20 bags at home. Everything sounds great right...? Wrong!

First off I got a call from the drug counselor saying I need to go drop a urine sample by tomorrow at 3 P.M. There's no way that pee is going to be clean. This I can't really get that mad at because in all honesty, it's my lack of foresight that's putting me in that predicament. Second, I lost all the dope, and most of the money I had left over, I have seriously looked everywhere to no avail. I had a sneaking suspicion that it was either my brother or his girlfriend but I told them, ""Look, if you guys stole it or have it please just tell me so I can stop looking around all over the place like a fucking idiot. Also, those 20 bags I mentioned, well I'm going to have to sell them to get money for my upcoming appointment/prescription. I would have been fine but I lost all my other money. Finally, I shot myself right into precipitated withdraw so I'm sick as fuck right now because I took subs so that my urine would have them present. A relapse or a dirty drop is bad with my drug counselor/prescribing doctor, but a urine test without any Bupe in your system is grounds for expulsion from the program. 

I have half a mind to start staying away from people I know, less my luck rubs off on them and they get hit by a bus or a stray bullet. Thanks for letting me rant boyos and girlos. I hope all of your current situations are a little more fortunate than mine. ",1392840041.0

The friend, Star, has a pre teen daughter,  that she has only had contact with over the last several months. It seemed star has been trying to get her life together. She was going to a methadone clinic for a while and just recently got discharged. She divorced her recovering junkie husband and moved back to her home state to live with her mother. She has been 100% clean for atleast 6 months. Bunny and Star have been friends since they were in grade school,  now both in their 30s. Star moved out of state when her daughter was a couple years old, for a several year long binge and ended up seeking help and meeting her now ex husband. My cousin, bunny, is one of the most important people in my life, I hate to see her anything other than perfectly happy.  And I will do whatever needs to be done to make sure of that. Both bunny and myself enjoy the, little more than occasional, opiate use. So I understand the slippery slope it usually turns into, as does my cousin. After years and years of no contact from star, she basicly shows up on the door step. Asks for bunny's forgiveness, of which she readily hands over. Bunny's way of looking at it is: yes she fucked up, but if she is willing and trying to get back on the waggon, then I'll support her for the entire ride. Well Bunny went to stars mom's house this morning to help with things around the house, and that's when she got the news that Star has been MIA for three weeks now. Not missing as in, we need to inform the police, we all know what she is doing. My reason for posting this here book, is to maybe find some advice on what I can do to help Bunny deal with the fact that no matter what she does, it's up to Star to make the decisions. And maybe a look into why Star is just throwing it all away... again. So that i can share it with Bunny.. to help her cope.

I signed up for IOP (Intensive Out Patient - I think we all know that word well here.) like a 5 weeks ago or so.  Now I have been clean for a while and I signed up for IOP for a few reasons. 


1) I had court on Feb. 14th and I wanted to be in a treatment group when I went to court. 

2) To show my family that I am truly staying clean. 

3) For myself.  My first IOP I did (my insurance approved the entire program upfront for the first one), I was eventually referred to a higher level of care cause I was still using but I didn't go seek a higher level of care.  A month or so after I got clean myself and have been since.  But I wanted to prove to myself that I could commit and that I could finish the program.

To get into IOP, I told them I had just quit using ect ect because I wasn't sure if they would accept someone who was a couple months clean.  Although, this time around my insurance fucked me and would approve me for 2 weeks upfront, then a week, and a week again, 2 classes and 2 classes again, to 1 class, to ""we're not paying for this anymore.""

My counselor called me as I was on my way out the door this morning going to IOP to tell me that.  Which pissed me off as I had gotten up, taken my vyvanse, showered, had a cup of coffee ect ect, for me to end up attempting to go back to sleep.  (Group is at 8-11am, I wake up at 6am to get ready and leave at 7am due to traffic getting to where I need to be)  My counselor told me that she told insurance that I needed to stay in group like she would anyone, but also I'm having a Liver Biopsy and thinks I could use the support for going through that and just feeding the insurance company what they want to hear to get  shut down and cut off.  

My insurance is VERY good.  I have been to 1 rehab, 2 IOP programs (including this one), and 1 detox over the course of like 2-3 years and insurance has paid for every dime of those costs which I am very grateful for, but where do they get the right to just assume that I'm fine now?  

I know I probably sound like a whiney bitch ""boohoo, I dont get to go to my rehab program that some may think I dont truely need.""  But it was something I looked forward to this time around.  I enjoyed the people in my group and my counselor was awesome.  Nobody was afraid to say how they were really feeling and there was great feedback.  So whether or not you or anyone else thinks I may have ""needed"" it, I certainly benefited from it, a lot.

Whatever I think thats the end of my crying rant.  I kinda wanna call up an inpatient program and see if I can get myself in just to waste my insurance's money.  Tell them I relapsed a few days after they cut me off of IOP and go waste a few thousands of there dollars.  Sadly it wouldn't do much to their bank account, but it would make me feel better.

TLDR; Ranting about how my insurance pissed me off by cutting me off from IOP, even though I've been clean a good while I was actually benefiting from being there this time around.  More backstory in the long dreadful post that you lazy people skipped and read this.  :D",1392998183.0

Ok I wanted to post this guide to easing withdrawal for a while and now I've finally gotten around to it. I hope that this helps at least one person get well, because then it worked. I figured it was worth sharing since I know at least one person other than me that it's worked for very recently.

Just so this is clear:

**DO NOT!!** Use this guide with Buprenorphine or Methadone!! **IT WILL NOT WORK, IT WILL BE HORRIBLE.**

**DO NOT USE** with the following medications:

Omeprazole (prilosec), Cimetidine (tagamet)

**MATERIALS REQUIRED**:

800mg Loperamide pills (don't get blister packs), 10x-15x doses benzodiazepines of choice, 2x laxatives, lots of marijuana (optional). 



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UCL's Guide to Easing Opiate Withdrawal**


**-0.)** Find a relatively short acting opioid/opiate to start taking. Hydrocodone, Dilaudid, Oxycodone, H, etc and take it for the next week (3-4 days minimum, longer if you are coming off an opiate with a longer half-life) before you start this guide.

**-1.)** You need to taper as much as is possible while taking into account your self-control limits. Can you handle getting 5 ""staying well"" doses or will you be nodding out by the end of the night with nothing in the morning?

You need to determine what you can handle and try your best to stick with it. If you're like me, you might just want to get 1 extra bag or 1 extra dose that will be only be sufficient to keep you well. Use as little as you can in the end and it will be much better, trust me. When you taper, you should only be taking enough to feel well. If you are getting a slight high it's better than full blown nodding, but you're cheating yourself out of an easier withdrawal. 

I used this method after using a half bun and 3 blues one night and then one bag the next day, and it worked surprisingly well.

**-2.)** When you are out of opiates, you need to wait as long as you can before you start eating lope. Really push as far as you can into withdrawal. Do anything you can non drug-related to feel better. Try some coffee if you like, take a shower, smoke some weed, eat a benzo or two, get under the blankets and watch a movie while drinking hot chocolate (my favorite). Stimulants can make your anxiety worse, but can also be useful in withdrawal, so be careful (stimulants inhibit GABAa receptors which are agonised by benzos, cancelling the effect to a degree). Benzos after stimulants will work, but stimulants after benzos likely will not. When you are really wiggin out/thinking about using, begin with 12-24mg of loperamide. Wash the pills down with some water and wait **3 hours**. It's about to get a lot better.

Loperamide has a very long onset as an opioid and taking more may be a bad idea. Remember, the idea here is to use as little as possible every time. After the 3 hours has passed, take another 6-24mg per hour until you feel normal enough to go on through your day without exceeding 80mg. I find marijuana also works great for quelling cravings and thoughts about opiates in addition to helping me sleep.

After 80+mgs, enough of the loperamide has been consumed that there might be some opioid activity in the brain (**YOU WON'T GET HIGH DON'T TRY**) and it will just **prolong** withdrawal instead of easing it. For this reason, **DO NOT** potentiate the loperamide with cimetidine (tagamet), quinine (tonic water), omeprazole (prilosec), grapefruit juice, etc or any kind of pgp/enzyme inhibitors. 

Once you've reached 80mg you are done for the day, if you cannot handle the withdrawal at this point this guide is not really gonna help that much. 

**-3.)** Analyze your previous dose and take the same amount (in larger incremental doses, 24-30mg at a time) when you next begin to withdrawal hard or at max once a day, minus a few milligrams. They come in 2mg pills, so 2-6mg reduction from your dose the first time, then an 8-18mg/day reduction would be a good example. 

You're going to continue this pattern of tapering your loperamide dosage every time you withdrawal for one week. 7 days exactly. If you haven't pooped in 36-48 hours at any point during this week, you need to eat a laxative (maybe stool softener too? loperamide never made me constipated) and take a fat shit immediately. Intestinal blockages are no joke. You could die or rip your asshole apart.

This week you should be trying your best to get things done, exercise, work your natural dopamine cycles. A few days of isolation will help but prolonged isolation will not. Get out, go to class/work, be social, get a drink, etc. Remember you can drink, smoke, do ketamine but not opiates. Some drugs that really might help:

**Ketamine** (no really), GHB, GBL, DXM, other NMDA antagonists (alcohol), GABAergics, benzos, stimulants, lots of marijuana, various supplements (multivitamins, duh! and niacin), ambien at night.

**-4.)** On day 7, you should be at 30mg/day or less of loperamide. You will already be one week into the mental/physical withdrawals, stick with it, it gets better! I got down to 24mg/day and when I jumped off it was easy (compared to without anything). At 18mg there will be no point to tapering the loperamide, it will not prolong any withdrawal at such a low dose. Exercise!

Day 8, stop taking loperamide and evaluate your withdrawal level. Still having a harsh time physically? Remember loperamide doesn't help mentally, it only helps by making you feel better physically. Go exercise before anything. Continue to take loperamide & benzos as sparingly as possible throughout the next week (days 8-14). Be careful not to develop a benzo problem, I've had one, it's terrible. You could have seizures or possibly die.

Smoke some weed, find a new hobby, change your lifestyle to what you want it to be. Now it's possible.

**DO NOT** keep taking loperamide after day 14. After this point it shouldn't be helping you at all anyway as the physical withdrawals are likely long over and it can only do more harm than good. 

If you've made it here, then you've made it to the end, congratulations. I used to think about heroin every day all the time, then once every day, now every couple of days I'll think about the feeling. But I'm not in a place where I can use opiates again casually and if you are like me then you shouldn't start using again. 

More power to ya!

(lets say your homeboy TROY is your middleman
So how much do you usually give TROY for; 

>copping from TROYS connect AND picking TROY  up and dropping him off,

>copping from TROYS connect while being picked up by TROY and dropped off (<15 min or less),

>^ same as above but the drive is 30-35 min.

As far as all of my friends and people I use with (minus of course my bropiate) the standard is 2-3 bags for the first two situations and 3-4 for the other. However my boy insists that he should be getting ATLEAST 6 for picking me up and dropping me off and seems to think that 2-3 is way too little for any of the examples. 

He's a really cool dude but this disagreement is understandably frustrating. I have my own connects but my ability to get a ride is spotty at best which makes going thru this guy one of my only options.

So what do you y'all think about middlemans and their pay for their service?


EDIT: just thought I'd elaborate on the situation. He sold me 6 of his bags for $40 instead of 7 for $40 because his homie wasn't pickin up. So technically, yes, I did pay $40 for a bun and only got 6 bags.

I jumped in the shower, cause I just didn't know what to do and thought it might help, and was red aaaall over where I had itched or touched! I took some flu medicine that I had cintaining promethazine, since I thought I remembered that that's an ingredient in alleegy medicine.. This was just to try to take something that might help in pure desperation. 

Anyone had something similar or know what could have caused it?? I took some sleeping aid pills lasy night containing diphenhydramine if you'd think the combination could make that reaction? 

Half an hour later now it's better and I'm able to sit still and write this after a long shower, but I still feel it a bit. The flu medicine with the promethazine could have helped by now tho, if it would help? Any suggestions to what I could to do prevent this again, or what caused it? 

Thanks in advance guys! Am searching on google as I write this too, but wanted to see if any of you had any similar experience or tips.. :)",1392991717.0

1yj63u,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1yj63u/my_experience_with_pst/,19,https://redd.it/1yj63u,datsfunny,My experience with PST,"I had done a lot of research on pst before trying it. I have a lot of experience with scripts, although iv never tried morphine. I have no tollerance right now because iv been clean for 6 years. So i fugred it should be pretty easy to get a buzz. I got some popular seeds that most people know about and say are good.  
  
I got an empty 2 liter and a 2 liter of minute maid lemonaid. Punched holes with a small nail in one of the caps. I added 1 pound of seeds to the empty 2 liter and covered it with lemonaid. Shook hard for about 5 min and then put the hole punched cap on it and squeezed it into an empty gatoraid bottle. Then i added a little more lemonaid and repeated.  
  
The mixture tasted like how id imagine paint would taste. Iv herd someone else use that analogy and i think it was pretty dead on. Very bad tasting and even though the lemonaid was yellow, the tea was a slight brownish color. Like a dark yellow mixed with a hint of brown.  
  
I drank a little over half of the mixture, cautious for ODing. About an hour after drinking, i started to feel funny. It didnt feel like the on set of opiates. More like i was in a cloud and feeling kind of anxious and weird.  
  
About 30 min later i started to get a VERY slight euphoria. Smiling a little and feeling more talkative. But nothing too big.  
  
2 hours after initial dose i feel the very slight (maybe even a placebo) euphoria is allready going away. So i said fuck it, i dont think ill be ODing off what im feeling so i drank the rest.  
  
Not much changed in the hour following drinking the rest so i made another half pound of tea the same way i did the first and drank that. This time in the following hours i started to feel sick. In a daze. Like if someone were to talk to me my voice was weak. I started feeling really sick and had to go throw up twice. Got sweaty a little and felt like even just sitting there i was nauseus.  
  
After eatting some crackers and just resting for about 2 hours, the sick feeling went away. I just felt drained. It felt like how you feel when you are coming down from a really good oxycodone high. Droopy, relaxed, burnt out, just wanted to go to bed. So i did.  
  
This morning i felt chill still. On the way to work my eyes were droopy and almost nodding out. Still feeling that way a little. But no euphoria. It wasnt a good nod. Just a burnt out feeling one. I usually get talkative and energetic on opiates but not this time.  
  
Is this a somewhat normal reaction? The throwing up and not feeling well could be because i took too much. But i feel like even if i did take too much, where was the euphoria? It was like only the bad effects of opiate high and none of the good.  
  
I have plenty of seeds left and im thinking about trying just half a pound today and only drinking the half pound worth and seeing how that does.  
  
EDIT: Also, whenever i use opiates, i lose my sex drive completely. Last night i couldnt cum for my fiance no matter how hard i tried. So i know i had some strong opiate effects going on. Just never felt the euphoria i was hoping i would. Again, just all the negative opiate effects without the good ones.  
  
UPDATE: So this morning, i decided to make another half pound mix the same way i did yesterday. Drank it and 4 hours later was feeling pretty chill. I think because it was piggybacking off the feeling i still had from yesterdays mix. After reading some comments, i decided maybe the lemonaid was too rough and unnececary on my stomach, so i just made a half pound with plain tap water and i took a half a bynadryl with it. I have a lot of allergies and im thinking maybe part of the reason i was so sick is something reacted in my stomach. So the bynadryl will hopefully cancel anything like that and add another effect of sedation. Iv herd it can potentiate it too. Ill update in a few hours when i start to feel this batch.  
   
UPDATE 2: Its been about 2 hours since drinking the 2nd halfpound mix with only water and im feeling much better than i was yesterday. Nodding every so often at the computer and feeling pretty relaxed. Slight hint of euphoria. Not an energetic euphoria like hydrocodone gives me. More like a mellow, everything is good, type of euphoria. But it feels good. I feel like its constantly growing in stregnth though. I feel like im wanting to nod more and more as the time goes on.  
   
FINAL UPDATE: Today is MUCH better than yesterday. I feel like iv taken a few oxycodone. Not a whole lot of the euphoria but im feeling all the relaxing qualities you would expect. Nodding pretty good while sitting at the computer. Not feeling sick at all. I guess making the tea with just plain water and only a small bit of lemon is the way to go. I guess i didnt expect it to be so heavy on the stomach. And adding the half a bynadryl really seemed to help. Im not in a really talkative mood like i would normally expect on an opiate but im feeling pretty much all the other good effects that something like oxycodone would give. ",1392987964.0

I'm going to tell you about my opiates story, from that first oc to the bags I just finished, to the times i've kicked and how i did so, the relapses, and everything in between in hopes of hearing similiar stories, maybe support for getting clean, to be honest I'm not 100% sure what I want to get out of posting this.

(This story may end up being long, so I'm going to leave out the early ""occasionally pop some hydros"" era)

First some backround: For the sake of anonymity, I'm posting this on an alt account. I'm 26 years old, and a fully functioning opiate addict. I'm a mechanic (automotive) and I'm damn good at what I do. I'm not a squatter, train hopper, or down and out in any sort of way. I've got a wife and kids, who I wouldn't trade for the world, or rather all the dope in the world. They come first.

About 5 or 6 years ago, I started working in retail store, similiar to Wal-Mart. My girlfriend at the time was the one who first introduced me to oxycontin. When chasing her before i finally got her to fall for me, I'd talk a big game, yeah i do OC's all the time, they aint shit i want some real drugs blah blah blah. On the day of my interview for this retail job, she gave me some blue hydro 10's and wished me luck, and offered me a very generous sexual reward if I got the job. Needless to say I did, and in all my excitement, I told her we would ""go hard"" and split an OC 80 when I got my first pay check (bear in mind i've never done an OC at this point, and couldn't find em if i tried). First pay check comes around, and we're chilling, I almost forgot about my promise. Dude texts her saying he's good, come through, so I was like OH SHIT lets do this, we're really going to do this! What a mistake. Not only was i physically destroyed by splitting this OC80 with her, puking everywhere, scratching my face off, irritable as fuck, It was also the start of a long hard life ahead filled with opiates, which i had no idea at the time. Fast forward a few weeks into this new job. I met this girl I started working with, a real dime piece, a perfect 10. I was a pig at the time, would date multiple girls at once, yadda yadda yadda, and needless to say I wanted this girl. We'd occasionally do some dro's/small OC's/roxies together on our lunch break, but never anything serious yet, until the one day I sent her a picture of 8 or 9 OC80's i was taking on a trip to NYC with me. She immediately fell in love lol, and we became a couple. We started slow, maybe an OC 80 and a 40 or 60 every Friday after payday together, and that was it. Weekend warriors. Occasionally we'd go on ""hot streaks"" as my hook up would call it, getting shit for 3 or 4 days in a row. This was when OC's were 50 cents a mg, 80's were 40 bucks, but with prices rising slowly, eventually up to 60 bucks an 80. Fast forward a few more months, to where our hot streak was every day. We'd come up with scams at work to get money, like if a customer forgot to use a coupon instead of ringing it in as $2, we'd ring it in as 12, or 22, and just get random coupons equallying out to the rest of the value, doing this 10+ times a day and we were well off every day. Then that first time we went a lil over 24 hours without doing anything, it hit her first, then me a few hours later. Seemed like a flu with our joints, and especially our legs acting up. This was the worst feeling in the world, and we immediately knew what it was- withdrawls. Needless to say, we did everything we could to make sure that wasn't ever going to happen again. (and by this i mean by constantly using, not kicking, to make sure we never got dope sick) Fast forward. End up ending the relationship with this girl, but my addiction was in full swing. Looking back on it now, I was fucking crazy some of the shit i did for money. First it started with hustling, ya know getting shit for other people but making 10-15 bucks off the top, eventually straight robbing people (selling fake heroin, getting someones money and telling them i'll be right back with their shit and running off, etc). I started passing bad checks at the supermarkets, even grabbing bills from the 50's/100's slots at a gas station and just taking off. Quite the mischievous bastard I'd say.

By this time OC's were turning into the OP's (the non crushable OC's, not opanas) but Opana was getting big. OC wasn't shit compared to opana, the only plus it had was you were able to shoot OC's (later learned that opana could be shot with rubbing alcohol). So i was living my junky lifestyle, couch surfing, no home, a decent job on a sit-down assembly line, but no real direction with life. I was getting in trouble at work for falling asleep constantly (aka nodding). I was also started to get really into the hard at this point (crack). So now I was hooked on 2 drugs. Have to wake up and get my opiate fix, then the rest of the money for the day went up in smoke. Bad bad mix, for those of you that have never smoked, the come down is terrible, you will do ANYTHING (literally) for that next hit. I thought of crazy ass scams to rob dealers, gangsters, serious dangerous shit. I didn't care, as long as I was high. One morning i'm on my way to my opana dudes house, and notice a few cop cars blocking off the road in front of his house, a bunch of big white vans, and armed SWAT officers around his house. FUCK- my dude got raided. This blew hard, cause he was the only hook up in town, he was running the opiates game. I had no subs or anything of the like, so I did the only thing i could think to do- get some more rock. More and more. This is where it gets interesting. A few days (i think) of rock binging went by, and i realized what the hell? i'm not dope sick! after a few days! We're talking 72 hours plus! And thats when I had realized I was one lucky son of a bitch and managed to kick, without any withdrawls. I replaced my opiate addiction with a pipe addiction. While as thrilling as it sounds, unfortunately like I said earlier this was dangerous. One day i pulled off a big scam and robbed my rock dude of $500+ of some fire work, and when it was all gone being stupid enough to go and try to legitimately buy some from him. Woke up a few days later in the hospital, I had not only gotten my ass whooped by 6 dudes, but also thrown out a second story window. As crazy at it sounds, being high as a kite is the only thing that made me survive. My alertness, and ability to bear through the pain. Eventually when i was released from the hospital word got to me that we were'nt square yet, and to not leave town. Obviously, I went into hiding. Fast forward, i find out this dudes in jail, ended up getting raided yadda yadda. Ghost mode deactivate! But being ghost for so long, I lost touch with everyone. For the first time in years, i was 100% sober of all drugs.

This was an incredibly exciting time, As i was ready to get my life back on track. Fast forward a bit. Remember my girl from the retail job? she comes back into my life, but only as a friend. A dope friend. She's got a connect, this and that, we start fucking around and getting twisted maybe twice a month together. I""m holding down a good job etc. Fast forward to present day, especially since this post is getting rediculously long. 

Now though, its strictly heroin. The pill buzz doesn't touch a nice dope buzz, but i'll never shoot it. Needles aren't for me. Everyone tell sme I""m wasting it, and compared to banging it, yeah i probably am. I'm just a lil chickenshit when it comes to that. The problem witht he dope is, all my connects are middle men. So i stay getting fucked. Everyone has to make theirs on top, either cash, or bags, or if its a lose G taking a nice quarter G out for themselves. I end up wasting so much money this way, bt i'm just at that point where I dont care, as long as I get high. I need to kick this awful shit again, for the sake of my family. I know I am perfectly functional now, but for how long?

This girl is still a dope friend, we take turns buying a few times a week and getting incredibly twisted. I'm not at the point where i'm feeling full withdrawls again (although i do believe i am sensing P.A.W.S. occasionally) But its back to that point where when it gets in my mind i wont rest til i get twisted. I've got a good job, a great family who believes i am clean but yet i still come up with rediculous excuses as to why i fall asleep in my dinner plate and always have tiny pupils. I don't want to stop getting high especially with full blown withdrawls right around the corner again, but at the same Time i can't stop. Has anyone else been in this shitty situation? How did you cope?

I guess what i'm looking for witht his story is maybe support, how people cope, is anyone else like this? Granted iI left ALOT of detials out (most of the good ones sadly) to try and cut this article down, but if anyones interested in talking I'm more then glad to open up and share. Has anyone else used rock to get off opiates? Maybe this will be a whole waste of time, figure it was worth a shot though, as I have no one in real life that I can reach out to. Feel free to comment on here, or in PM's.

My question however is, how many times your usual dose to get high would it take to overdose with Oxycodone (would this be different for heroin ?) ? 

I need about 40-50mg to get a decent high but I want to try more to feel more high without running a significant risk of over-dosing. Obviously I'm not thinking of doing 100mg+ straight away but would it be safe to try say 65-75mg or so ? 

Secondly, I've read about the signs of opiate overdose but how can I tell I've gone too far ? I eat Oxycodone (in powder), and I usually feel it after 1h and peak about 2 hours in. How noticeable is it if I have a hard time breathing or something ? Are the signs subtle or is it pretty clear if you've done too much ? 

Thank you, and I hope this can help others out here too to consume their drugs more safely.",1392923389.0

Was just wondering how everyone's eating habits are when off opiates or on?

I started thinking about this now since I just ordered loots of junkfood to my door (+ cake), basically just because I'm so bored today without opiates haha. When I'm on opiates I barely eat, but make myself eat cause theb I don't feel as shit or as exhausted. I eat a lot of fruit, especially green apples and grapes, and candy, because of the drip since I snort,and often popcorn or something salt if I'm nauseous. When I'm in mild withdrawal I don't feel like eating anything but just have to make myself eat something that's fast to make, something with vegetables in and all. 

So, me eating, or ordering, lots of junk was soo not typical me, think this is the second time I've gotten takeaway the last months AND first time all alone in my room.. watching movies on netflix, and enjoying some junk! Ofc I got way too much but have had insomnia the last days and always wake up starving; so at least now I have some night food haha :)

Usually anywhere from 120-150mg per day.  I've been running out earlier and earlier in the month every month, and for the last several months Ive been doctor shopping.  Well, they found out and my insurance has me blacklisted from opiates and benzos as far as I know.  The cravings are wicked, everyone talks about the physical withdrawals but for me the mood swings and depression are the worst.  I'll take the puking, shits and sweats, but the mood swings are just ridiculous, and interfering in my life.

Anywho, I decided on a whim to buy about 60 grams of kratom from a headshop.  From what I've read it's not very understood how it works, but it's been seen to stop opiate cravings.  

The guy told me that most people do 3-5 grams on their first dose, so I downed 30 grams at once.  It tasted like shit but within 10 minutes the feeling was there.  That feeling of something being ""different"" that I'm sure all opiate users are familiar with.  My sickness actually was gone the second it hit my stomach, but that probably had more to do with me expecting to not be sick anymore, and the placebo effect kicking in.  Anyway, it's been about 30 minutes since I've taken it, and everything is awesome.  I'd say this is the equivalent to about 30-35 mg of oxy at this point, I'll update it if it gets any stronger.

The moral of this weeks story: Generosity and Goodness begets Generosity and Goodness.","As some of you may know from my post earlier this week, I found a large amount of dope and money. With my tolerance being maybe 2-3 bags a day, I thought it best to sell/give away a lot of the stuff I had so that I wouldn't start doing insane amounts. I kept 15 for myself and I still have 6 left! After 45 bags and $1400. it all came full circle. 

One of my friends was short on cash until she got her paycheck today. She asked if I could front her a few bags, so I threw her 4 and told her not to worry about it. Today she showed up to my house and said, get dressed I'm buying you a steak and some drinks. We went to Harry Carrie's steak house and I had an amazing filet and whiskey, it was well worth the 4 bags. I took $300 of the money I found and bought what my mom would consider, an amazing birthday present (I got her one of those goofy looking Dyson Vacuums... they're awesome). 

I gave another friend 10 bags, again telling him not to worry about paying me back, but he showed up with 2 buns, no charge, of what I would consider to be the most fire Heroin I have ever had (disclaimer: I've only been doing ECP for about 2 weeks now and my tolerance is really low after 9 consecutive months clean). My next door neighbor is an old, relatively feeble man, who is on A LOT of pain medicine. I introduced him to heroin after he caught me doing blues in his garage while I was doing his yardwork for him. 

Again, he can't really get around that well, let alone manage the yard or snow removal in this cold Chicago winter. Anyways, I gave him 10 bags because the amount of Oxy he receives wasn't cutting it. Today was refill day so I drove him to the pharmacy, and he gave me half of his Blue script, 90 of them, and told me to let him know from now on when I'm going to be picking up. Sometimes I hang with him after I scoop and we drink whiskey while I listen to the myriad of awesome stories he has from the years that he has lived. I'm sure a lot of them are embellished but they're entertaining as fuck nonetheless. 

I gave 7 of them to a kid from Reddit that just moved to North Carolina. I overnighted them with the USPS and man was he happy. I got an email today from Amazon that a copy of The Last of Us was sent to me. Man, I'm excited to be play that shit. The other 15 odd bags I sold at 5 a bag, it was much appreciated. 

I don't mean to sound boisterous or braggadocios about my good fortune, rather, I'm trying to lift the mood and spirits of the people on here. Too often I see stories of how someone OD'd for the 8th time and are just waking up in the hospital, or worse, not at all. I read stories of people in such desperation just to get a fix. I read stories about people ripping other people off or getting ripped off. I read stories and see pictures of peoples bodies, covered in cysts, infections, and abscesses. I just wanted to spread a little goodness by posting this. I think it really says something about how much people appreciate a little help. 

I went into this expecting nothing in return, even if they told me they'd get me back. I guess I've become a bit cynical over the last 2 years of my drug use, and tend to expect the worst from people, because I gave nothing but the worst to others. I know not everyone is able to give and be generous or help people out, but if you are capable of it, do it. You'll get a lot in return, Karma does exist outside of this website. The game is played loose and fast, but this week I didn't really have to concern myself with that. I was trying to be neighborly as Mr. Rogers would say. Anyways, that's all.

TL;DR: Find drugs & money. Give some away. Get a lot more than I gave away in return. Make a new friend, get more dope, hear cool stories, eat good food, and renew a more positive view of the world around me. ",1393059274.0

Of course i experience the constipation, and then extreme ease of pooping while withdrawing that opiates cause, but does anyone experience weirdness with there urination? Specifically guys?

When I am high, i get a weird sensation similar to stage fright  (stage fright happens if im real stoned or nervous, go into a crowded bathroom and when u whip your dick out, you cannot piss, but you know you have to go, and you awkwardly stand there wondering if the dude next to you is wondering what the fuck this creep tomy left is doing, not peeing in the urinal?)

so pretty much i cannot pee standing up, at all, unless maybe i have to go extremely bad (im talking water drinking marathon then holding it for a few hours), havent really had to go extrmeley bad as of late, i likely dont drink enough water during the day, my pee is normally pretty yellow. but yeah so when im high i cannot pee at all standing up. it is very difficult for me to pee evensitting down, the setup that allows me to urinate the quickest / least effort is literally me taking off my pants / any belt, and even my socks. (yes i have notied a difference even with my socks on and then off lol. sometimes this is the factor that pushes it over the edge, im just like fuck why cant i pee, take off my socks, pee)

its literally strange as fuck. i live with my girlfriend whom i use with and im not really like embarrsed about it, its just strange to me. and it would definiely get very annoyiing if i was homeless or in a situation where i had to always use a semi public bathroom (dorms)

so guys, be honest, does any of this sound familiar to you, and its just not talked about as frequently? or is it all psychological? not denying that that could be it, but i doubt its completely that, because no matter what it seem i cant stand and pee. or should i go to a urologist?

I've been off everything except for a few weekend binges of PST, herb, and in the worst case scenario a emergency script for a few 1mg kpins from my doc when I'm unable to break the anxiety attacks without drugs.

The past 2 weeks have had me cornered and potentially could make me lose my job over a misunderstanding that happened after my Lithium dose was increased (with doctors supervision). I was so anxious and manic that I could not sleep, eat, or use my hands because of tremors from the anxiety. Also by blood pressure was so high it impacted my ability to read or work on the computer (I work in IT/Systems Engineering so not being able to use a computer is very bad).

Where I live it's impossible to find anything outside of herb and maybe a 30mg Oxy if you're lucky and my PST sources dried up. Before tonight I've had no more than 1 hr sleep/night for the past and was getting close to doing something that I can't take back once done.

This should be fun!,"I made a post earlier just been dumb, that mentioned a made up situation, that involved all sorts of random shit just trying to be funny, and it gave me an idea!!!!


Finish this story:

I name a few things, and then you post a small little story, that includes these random things I choose, in your storyline. And not just a mention. I mean the things have to actually be USED! then, once you post your story, at the end, you post 4 more random things, and someone can reply to your post with their story with those 4 things in it, and then they do the same!


It can be about ANYTHING, ANYKNE, ANYWHERE, but since this is the opiate sub, maybe we will try to make it somewhat about opiates or a situation an opiate user may be in, but by no means does it HAVE to involve opiates. Just a suggestion.


So for instance, if someone posts shoelace, baseball bat, a rear view mirror from a car, and a golf ball, you make a short little story, involving those 4 things in it like....


 I was walking down the road the other day, when a homeless man started chasing me with a baseball bat!!! I pulled out my shoe laces, and tied them to two street signs on opposite sides of the road. Then, i ripped the rear view mirror out of my car, and proceeded to reflect the sun off of it and into his eyes, blinding him momentarily, just long enough for him to trip right over my shoelace trap. Once he was dazed from banging his head on the concrete, I took aim, and launched the golf ball from my hand, with a powerful throw, and managed to make it go directly down his throat, blocking his airway, therefore, the homeless man couldn't chase me anymore and try to steal my dope! Haha

That was very loosely done, and short just to get the point across. This could be a really stupid idea, but I just figured from all the novel sized posts I've seen people make, we've actually got some people here that like writing, so it might turn out funny! 


Obviously the objective here IS to be funny, so please Dont turn it into something like the baseball bat is symbolic for the narrow road your going down, and the golf ball is your bag of dope, the shoelace being your tourniquet, and the rear view mirror is a reflection of yourself and who you've become and blah blah blah. Don't do it haha this is supposed to be funny. 


You could even add on to someone's story, with the 4 objects they name, and we could just have one huge story. So this may fail, or it may not. Who cares. Just thought I would throw my idea out there. The first 4 words are:


Trampoline

Shoebox

Battery


Pickle

I used it one time and don't know what happened, they never brought it up but I still am not sure if that means it worked or they just didn't mention it yet.

And I've looked on google a thousand times. But I can never get a definitive answer. How long does heroin last in your piss. I have parole Monday, got high Thursday at about midnight (Friday Morning) by the time I piss it'll be about 85 hours or so.

First WARNING- MAKE SURE YOU DRINK A LOT OF WATER WITH YOUR LOPE DOSE

THE REASON:

I've made the mistake, *twice now*, of only drinkiing enough water to get the 30 pills down my throat easily and both times, I ended up in the ER. What happened was, an hour after my dose I start noticing I was really sweaty and couldn't cool down so I went to take a shower to cool down a little, but noted when I got up that I was REALLY REALLY weak, physically. In a matter of minutes it was almost impossible for me to walk anywhere because the action would literally cause me to collapse from exhaustion. This was scary, just by itself, but what sent me to the ER in an ambulance was THE PAIN. It felt like someone had jabbed me in the stomach with a knife and was continually twisting it, non-stop (meaning it didn't hurt for like a minute then feel okay for a bit, then hurt again, over and over, it just hurt continously) and it also felt like my insides were on fire, and I was passing out because at that point, just the mere action of being awake was too exhausting. I kept slipping in and out of consciousness at the hospital until I finally woke up with an IV in, and a bag of saline being pushed. Once the whole bag was gone, the pain subsided and the second time it happened, I forced myself to chug a shit ton of water and it passed within an hour and a half.

SECOND WARNING: DO NOT TAKE LOPE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, LIKE MORE THAN A MONTH

Last year was one of the most horrible years I've ever had and the reason was because of lope. What happened here was I had no way to get meds, really, and just kept taking lope, no thoughts of weaning or anything like that, and before I knew it, 2 months had gone by where I took almost nothing but loperamide. 

Then, at my family's urging, I started seeing my suboxone doctor again. After my initial visit with him, I switched from taking lope to taking the suboxone and thought it was fine to just move on like that.

3 Days Later, I was sobbing to my mom begging her to help me. I was in the midst of one of the worst panic attacks I've ever had. I started having them 4 or 5 times a day, and every waking moment was spent feeling terrified for no reason and I literally just could not be happy no matter how I tried. These panic attacks lasted 2 weeks and by the end of them, I wasn't able to calm down. 

Taking lope nonstop for 2 months literally led to me almost going crazy with fear for SEVEN MONTHS in 2013. The anxiety and depression from stopping the lope lasted 7 months last year, I shit you not. It made 2013 one of the worst years I've ever had and I planned out my suicide nearly every day just to get some relief from the fear

These are just a couple things I found while I used lope. Now I know these things and avoid them, even though I still take lope to avoid wiwthdrawal, I just avoid taking it for long enough to develop a dependency on it ",1393014212.0

My mom seems to be getting a little concerned about the potential of me being on strong pain medicine for the majority of my life. She recently mentioned that I am soon going to see a new pain doctor at Emory Hospital in Atlanta, which if you don't know is one of the largest and well respected hospitals in the world. Im nervous that this new big-time Emory Dr. Y is going to cut me off of the medicine prescribed by Dr. X, the medicine that I need, and try to switch me onto something less risky. what are the chances of this? given that I have been taking this 20mg oxy i will undoubtedly have some withdrawal issues due to a built up tolerance.

1yk7uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1yk7uw/my_lope_experience/,12,https://redd.it/1yk7uw,crushstickahhh,My lope experience,"Ok, to start I'm putting it out front that I have crohns, and have had surgery 5 times. So I have some pretty major intestinal issues, and dont wihs to take 100+ mg of imodium. Though I can eat normally most of the time, some days I just feel like shit. So I go to pain management and get 70 4mg dilaudids every two weeks. Every time I run out early and was just sucking it up for 6-7 days. So I decided to try lope.

So after looking at all the bullshit online I decided on taking two Omeprazole (40mg) and Ten Loperamide (2mg). I have to be careful with Imodium due to the crohns, as I don't want to create any major stoppage. I get massive heart burn and normally take 20mg Omeprazole daily, so an extra one was taken after reading wiki.

Wow do I actually feel good. I know it isnt placebo as I felt like shit this morning, swollen knee, stomach aches, normal stuff for me that lasts all day. So for me to feel any better there has to be something going on. I know it doesn't cross the BBB (not the better business bureau) but I feel well enough to go jump on my bike, which is a damn rare feeling.

And haikus about shitting your pants.,"Hello guys. In anticipation of my WDs I stocked up on some OTC med including a full bottle of lope (72 count I believe?  Have to check when I get home). I ended up not needing it but as I already threw the box the bottle came in away I can't return it. The bottle itself is unopened. Seeing as I spent around $20 on it I'd like to see it go to someone who could use it. 

Kind of fitting to post this now as the top post is a meme about shitting your pants. So anyway I'm in NJ (Morris County) and I will be in NYC all day tomorrow so if anyone wants to meet up in person I can give you it. Otherwise I'm willing to mail it. 

All I want from you in return is a haiku. The theme of course is why you need this bottle of lope. Post here and I'll pick who gets it (taking upvotes into consideration). 

Even if you don't need the lope, post a haiku about having the shits anyway (just for shits and giggles!) Just specify in your post that you don't need it.

I did my last big shot at 9pm (Saturday night) and I'm gonna start sub tomorrow. I have a 10-15 bag a day (IV) habit. I only saved two bags for the transition, but I also have some oxy (which doesn't do much to get me high but has worked in high doses in the past for me to ease PWD). Should I use the h first or the oxy? I'm hoping it won't matter because I'm hoping after that initial sub dose of .5-2 mg, precipitated wd won't be an issue (cuz at that point I'll already have the Bupe in me).

Anyone else gotten on sub this way? Should I use the h first or the oxy? Again, I know the oxy will help more after the first dose than any other time (cuz it's weak, weaker than heroin - maybe it wouldn't work after the second sub dose, idk), but I shouldn't need anything after the second sub dose, so should I just use the bags after the first sub dose?

Gender: Female

Age: 24 

Drug of Choice (if you are clean state your previous drug of choice and how long you have been clean and or chipping): oxymorophone

Duration of Opiate Use (not necessarily how long you have been using your DOC, but just opiates as a whole): 6 years (roughly 2 of which I spent clean cold turkey for my job)

ROA (Route of Administration): snorting 

How big is your weekly/daily habit: for me this fluctuates from week to week sometimes even day to day depending on funds and what is available at the time but ideally 3-4 15 mg opanas a day or 6 oxycodone 30's a day

General area you live in (don't give exact locations): Southeastern United States 

Remember all of this is completely optional if you are not comfortable answering anything just leave it out, I am mainly just curious about gender and age for the most part the other is just some extra stuff thrown in there.

Pretty shitty, especially considering I'm young and have always taken care of my body (except my veins of course).

I'm not currently dependent on opiates and will have no problem being sober for the surgery, but I have a tolerance like a motherfucker. Both me and my father are this way, including being immune to local anesthetics, every time I've needed stitches in the past I had to be put under general. This is however the first time needing general post addiction. To top it off I also have a heavy tolerance to benzos as a result of an anxiety disorder ffs.

I have only had a consolation with the doc who ran the tests so I didn't bother to bring up my tolerance. I'm leaving that discussion for the surgeon and anesthesiologist in the many meetings that will precede the actual surgery.  

I know benzos are often used as induction agents, and opiates maintenance agents. This makes me real nervous. 

I'm sure many of you have needed surgery before so I guess I'm just wondering what your experience was like? How was the good doc able to work around this problem?

It was my first time doing heroin but it wasn't my first time doing opiates. I'd been doing OP's sense I was 13 and I fell in love. The first year I took 15-25 mg of an op, the second year I was taking 40mg, and by the time I was 18, and before i was leaving for basic I need 100mg to get high. But there I was, high as fuck off 20 dollars of heroin. I felt that love again. 

I've been doing heroin every day sense then. There were great times, nodding out, having sex for hours, and generally feeling amazing. But there's always a low to the high. I got caught, and my ex fiance went to rehab. I didn't quit, I moved to a place where I could deal, and started slinging large amounts. That ended when I got my ass beat and lost over a thousand dollars. I was sent to a shitty rehab where I eventually left..

Now here I am, still doing heroin, alone, and confused. I'm broke. I steal for drugs. I whore myself out. I have turned into a piece of shit and I know it, but I cant stop. I met a girl, a sober clean amazing beautiful girl who has dreams, goals, and is ambitious. I remember when I had dreams, but now all I can think about is how I'm going to score.

1ysloc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1ysloc/weight_gainloss_while_on_opiates/,21,https://redd.it/1ysloc,ishnupoo,Weight gain/loss while on opiates.,"Typically, opiate addicts are portrayed as people who are essentially wasting away. They're skinny, fragile, and pale. While I'm pretty pale, I think I've actually been gaining weight during my little dope binge over the past 2 weeks. I have a little bit of a gut that sort of resembles a beer belly. I think some of it might have something to do with the constipation which results in some bloating, but I'm certainly not all skin and bones. 

My inquiry is about what all y'alls experience has been. Are any of you just supremely skinny from your opiate use or do you find that you gain weight in a certain are of your body? Also, what about your appetite? I've noticed an affinity towards sweets. Not just sugary candies and drinks, but things like cake, and cupcakes and pastries that, in all honesty, I really don't care for that much while not on opiates. Other favorite foods of mine, chips, crackers, beef and other meats, or salty savory things, have sort of lost their appeal.

(throwaway account for a few reasons) 
After a particularly mentally & physically deflating 10 day crystal & heroin bender, I came to terms with a few grim financial realities. With a new apartment lease getting signed, and a new vehicle on the way I no longer had any disposable income other than a few loose bills to buy up my street subs for the rest of the month. 

In the past 6 months, the longest I had gone without taking 2mg of sub was 2 or possibly 3 days - meaning the sub never left my system entirely. I would sometimes not take it for a day and then use that night, taking it the next morning and going about my day business as usual. 

So when I decided to take sub yesterday thinking it was ""business as usual"" I'd forgotten I hadn't taken any in 10 days (I also ended up banging it - 1mg because I was feeling both apathetic and reckless). It ended up being slightly different than status quo: right as pushed the final five units home I felt this frigid burning sensation make its way from the dirt under my toe nails to the root of every last hair on my head.

Yes, this was precipitated withdrawal. It sucked for a while, but I got off easier than I had in the past...likely because of the small amount of sub used. Anyway, I decided to get high again last night and then today I had leftovers.

Tomorrow morning, however, I hop on a plane for a business trip. I guess what I'm unsure of is whether I inducted myself with that 1mg yesterday. I road out the precipitated w/d, used dope again, and would obviously love to take 2mg of sub sometime tomorrow if at all possible.

Look at it this way...

At 11am tomorrow morning I'll have had:
- 45 hours since 1mg sub & precipitated withdrawal
- 12 hours since last intake of .15 IV heroin

I guess given the way half-life works with bupe I should have a little less than .5mg sub still in my system around that time tomorrow. The whole precipitated withdrawal piece just throws me off though since I don't really have experience going back to continued sub use quite soon after.

Thoughts? Similar experiences? If you have advice great, but I also realize it's a fairly specific set of experiences.

To start off, I don't know how I'm alive. I have an amazing streak of luck when it comes to being in danger. I've been stabbed in my back where my kidney is (must not have gone deep enough), I totaled my car in a near head-on collision, with a dualy-truck, driving at 35mph, which caused me to flip and land upside down. I miraculously walked away un-injured. (Though I did go to the doc and manage to squeeze perc 10s outta him. Hehe fucked up, I know.)

Okay so...Moving on.
On one particular, night of a full moon, myself and two friends (well label them A and B) decided to get twisted. 
I had 200 dollars and blew 100 on .5 ECP (I'm assuming it wasn't that great, you'll see why in a sec) and I bought 3 xanny bars.

Dose up. I take all 3 bars. Begin prepping my shot. I'm already rampaging with all my inhibitions obliterated. A takes everything from me as apparently I'm missing the filter and jamming the point all over the spoon. We toss that needle, grab a new one, and A fills the syringe. A hits me (I can never pull the plunger myself. A 10 shot to test. My vision is instantly fucked. I can't see for shit. It's like riding around in a truck on a bumpy ass, gravel road. Fuck. I'm fucked up. Everyone else takes their shots. No where near as obliterated as I am. 

Apparently, I take a ten shot and walk to the living room. Collapse face first on the couch. A takes my shoes off for me and throws my feet on the couch so I'm more comfortable...I wake up STILL fucked up. (Although more clear headed, just feeling WAYYYYYYYY good.)

HOW THE FUCK did I not fall out? That was only my second time IV'ing. My tolerance HAD to have saved me. (I do sniff quite a bit.)

I don't condone mixing benzos the way I did at all. 
For some reason on benzos, I don't stumble around and slurr, and I have no tolerance. I become a loose cannon that can't be stopped. I AM QUITE AWARE how fucking stupid this was and I have counted my blessings. I have given up on benzos because I lose control of myself, completely.

Just a story I wanted to share with you all.

I've watched an unhealthy amount of movies the past 5 weeks after not really watching movies for like half a year. I've watched all of these in the past 5 weeks. Streaming of course. 

The bomb: 

- Django Unchained (Jamie Foxx in a Tarantino movie, nuf said)
- Cloud Atlas (Tom Hanks and Halle Barry are awesome, Halle Barry plays a white woman, very tough movie to follow when nodding though I'm sure) Edit: Barry plays a white woman in a few scenes, not the whole movie lol
- **American Hustle** (Probs my favorite I've seen outta them all)
- One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (a classic), 
- Gone Baby Gone (underrated as fuck, great movie)
- Capote (shout-out to our fallen brotheren PSH), 
- Hunger Games: Catching Fire (don't sleep on the books either, good easy reads)
- Into the Wild (I think many people here will relate to the main character in this)
- Thor (Both movies really surprised me, I really enjoyed the hell outta them.)
- The Princess Bride (1980 movie or something, of course its an absolute classic)

Damn good:

-  The Hobbit (Both are good)
- All The President's men (1976, tad slow but good)
- Someone Marry Barry (Smaller budget and fucking hilarious)
- Into the Furnace (Casey Affleck is one of my fav actors, gritty good movie)
- World War Z (good action zombie flick)
- Dallas Buyer's club (Matt M. has become an amazing actor, so close to making my top tier list)
- Mud (Matthew M. again, this one just made the list)
- The Wolf of Wall Street (Super entertaining but didn't crack my tops)

Good: 

- Ain't Them Bodies Saints (Casey Afleck again, Bonny and Clyde kinda movie but not really much action.)
- White House Down (better than I expected, entertaining flick)
- Ender's Game (Not bad for a sci-fi flick with a 13-year old lead, only decent but has some cool scenes in it)
- The Banshee Chapter (Pretty scary at parts, could have been great with a few changes)
- Frozen (Yes I watched this by myself, kinda a lot of singing in the beginning threw me off, nothing special really, but good if you have kids)

As far as television goes its incredible how many good series there are in the past few years, these are all shows I completely fell in love with and are at least 9/10. I've watched all these shows over the past year or so.

- Orphan Black - Only BBC series I've ever watched. Absolutely amazing show about a woman, you can't not mention how gorgeous she is, who lives a gritty life mixed up with drugs. Sees someone who is her doppleganger commit suicide in front of her. She steals her identity to clear out her bank, she leaves her stuff there to make it seem like it was her, faking her own death essentially. Turns out it wasn't a coincidence and things move incredibly fast in this show, really I can't say enough good things about it. Please watch this lol. (second season starts soon, this is on Netflix I think I heard)

- Homeland - Great show about a girl who works for the CIA and is an incredible field agent but is neurotic, and a little unstable which both helps and hurts her in her field. Great acting. Plot is about an American Marine who has been captured by Al Qaeda and kept for 6 (maybe 8?) years before American soldiers find him while taking down an Al Qaeda leader. Sargeant Brody returns to the States but he isn't the man he once was, is he a Muslim or has he been turned into a double agent? Watch it and find out, its worth it big time. (Three seasons so far, next one starts soon)

- The Americans - The only cable series besides ole faithful Breaking Bad that I've fallen in love with, thanks again FX). Plot takes place in the late 70s I believe when the Cold War is starting to heat up. Two seemingly normal American's with two kids live in Washington DC and seem to be a perfectly normal American family, except that they are Russian Sleeper Cells. Probably the most suspenseful TV show on the list so far. Kerry Russel is stunning and plays the badass wife of a guy who I can't remember his name but is also badass. Mother Russia starts to ask more and more of them. They're true alliance lies with Russia but America has grown on one of them more than the other ""at least the electricity is on here all the time."" says one of the characters while arguing about their lives in America. (Season two starts in a few weeks and re-runs are on all the time now.(

- Game of Thrones - Not gunna waste my time here as its already so popular.

- True Detective - First season is in progress, great show, difficult to explain kinda, but awesome nonetheless. Matthew Mc. and Woody Harrelson on a TV show?? Yes fucking please.

- The Wire - Our sub's favorite TV show!! Dope, dealers, cops, and the dangerous web they all weave together.

Edit:

- **SPARTACUS!** - Watch 1st season trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHxn8mTpAJU

Can't believe I forgot about Spartacus.**The first two episodes kinda sucked but it gets so much better** (Boasts an 8.7 on IMDB) I actually stopped watching after two episodes but a month later I gave it another shot and I am SO happy I did. I guess the Director wasn't getting the freedom to do what he wanted for the first few episodes but the studio relented. The first two episodes feel kinda cheap and dirty like the audience is dumb but it develops an amazing story quickly after. Honestly I'd watch the first two episodes but if you can't stand them just skip to episode 3 or 4, you'll still follow the show no problem. Beginning in season 2 the show has a ton of different locations while in the 1st season the show focuses on the Gladiator part.

The Roman empire tries to force Spartacus's people (Thracians) into a war they never agreed to and Spartacus 
refuses. He's sentenced to death by Gladitory but ends up winning even tho outnumbered. He becomes a legend in the Arena until he decides he's had enough of the lying ways of the house of Batearus (the house that owns him and the gladiators of Cappua) and vows to end the ways of slavery and rain hell upon the Roman's. 95% as good as   Game of Thrones imo from the mid-point of the first season on. It quickly gets better after episode 2 and really hits a stride soon after.  Three seasons and played on the Starz premium cable channel.

Sex, Violence, GORGEOUS women, Ancient Rome, INCREDIBLE FIGHT SCENES, Loyalty, Gladiatorum, Vengeance,  AND if you are a woman there are jacked dudes running around half naked all the time lol. It started for me as a bit of a guilty pleasure but quickly turned into a straight up favorite. Easy show to follow and perfect for nodding out, much less tricky storylines than Game of Thrones.

Take away those restless legs, cold sweats, and shaky everythings. 

Today, however, I was prepping one with all of the cottons from my last gram as well as some from a .4 and .6. I had been using older needles so some of the cottons had a bit more residue than usual. There was about ten in total, and I took two new ones and dampened them and ran them along the inside of about 6 or 7 loose baggies that I had floating around.

As I mixed in about 20cc, I noticed the water being VERY dark. I figured I could probably get a second wash out of them, so I ran 20 more CCs through. Still pretty dark. I told myself I would make another shot after this one so I didn't have to inject 60cc's in me at one time as that's a lot more liquid than I'm used to. 

Thank goodness I didn't.

Tied off, sat down on my injection thrown (the upstairs toilet) and immediately found a hungry little vein. I pushed it in pretty quickly as these were ""long"" needles and I didn't want to push through with my restless, shaky arms. Untied the belt and popped the needle out.

...

Next thing I remember? Laying on my side in between the bathtub and the toilet. Pants down to my ankles. Classic Elvis style. I have no idea how long I was out - it could have been 5 seconds, it could have been 5 minutes, but thankfully I survived with very minimal (if any at all aside from an elbow and shoulder bruise) wounds.

I got lucky. Really lucky. Be careful with those cotton shots - they may have a lot more in them than you think! I'm fairly new to IV, but have easily done .2 - .3 shots before and not dropped out.

I am prescribed 25 MCG patches. Therefore if I go to one pharmacy its gel and the other has the smaller ones that stick better. I usually go non gel just for convenience of not having to use tegaderm to keep them on. Typically I get a little less than I want just by really scrubbing my arm good with hot water and a wash cloth before putting it on. Sometimes the next 4-6 hours are perfect sometimes a bit less. Then the second night I will use a heating pad but it doesn't work as well. My script is for every 48 hours but they're supposed to last 72.
My question is what can I do that second night to get to where I want. Anytime I start working up the balls to gum one I just took off my arm or put an older one on with the day old one I get anxious and back out. My thought is there should be some left over since I change after only 48 but I have also heat them up so I don't know. Been on them for over a year so my tolerance is getting there but I don't really want to bring up moving up to 50s to my doc yet.

Further explanation in post","Hey guys,  I've been lurking this thread for a long time, and occasionally used to post under the name chattt, but i forgot the password.  I really like you guys and find this sub very entertaining and a pretty cool community.  There seems to be really cool/smart people here, along with the freaks. 

I don't IV, and never have.  I've built up a relatively small habit (compared to H IV'ers), but its still legit.  Takes me about 40-60 of rox to feel good.  I really like Opana at this point.  A 15 makes me feel pretty damn good. 

I've gone through some days where I can't score, and felt what seem to be the same feelings that people describe in WD's: restless legs, lack of sleep, tears from the eyes, no apetite, etc. 

BUT, i feel that non IV'ers kind of chalk themselves up to people who have serious IV habits.  For me, even though i've been going several years with pseudo daily use, I can survive the WD's for 2-3 days, and then it goes away.  I feel like people are kinda pussies about it and use it as an excuse to score.  It's really not THAT bad (for me).  

I also wonder if physically, my body is somehow different from others.  I binged on Opana for 2 weeks using almost every day (during 3 years of use), culminating in 2-3 moons per day the last few days, and was *dreading* the withdraw.  2 days later, i felt fine, and was like W.T.F?? It was awesome.  It really wasn't that bad.  

Yeah, my legs felt kinda shitty, and i definitely didn't feel good, but it wasn't this fuck-my-life-i-want-to-die scenario. 

Any thoughts?  Does anyone else feel like WD's are sometimes over stated?  Would it be possible that i'm physically lucky as shit to have been given a body that somehow doesn't respond in the same way? One thing that likely plays into the answer: I don't really chase 'the nod'.  I personally don't strive for the feeling of being extremely fucked up to where i'm slipping out of consciousness.  I like to do it to the point where I feel a boost and feel really happy/excited/up.  Doing it to the point where i'm falling asleep isn't what my target feeling is.

She's a heavy user (she injects several times a day but since I don't live with her and not with her all the time I can't say exactly how many times each day), and recently I've noticed that she sometimes has difficulty injecting herself when she never use to, it sometimes takes her several attempts before it goes in. 

She's developed a lot of sores on her upper arms and face (they're the ones that I have seen), she told me they are mosquito bites that she has scratched and taken the tops off. The site where she injects looks red and sore and has a small lump (on both arms but one is worse than the other). Her partner is really worried and confided to me that the sores are on her face, arms, stomach, groin, legs and back and are weepy; she has also developed quite a large rash on her back. 

She is incredibly self conscious and has gotten moody and angry when her partner has offered to dress them for her, so bringing up the subject is by no means easy. Any advice on the cause of the sores and rash would be greatly appreciated, as well as any suggestions on what might be the best way to talk with her about it without her getting angry (which happens very easily) and then withdrawing from us altogether.

can't lie, i've upped my usage a little bit to about 3g's/week(go through like .7 a day about, usually every other week, sometimes two weeks space, sometimes two weeks in a row), did a full g today though. obviously smoking it off foil but i've started getting a slight cough . nothing serious or heavy but just a light one every couple minutes. how fucked are my lungs getting? i'm not dumb, i can only imagine how bad smoking tar off of fucking foil is, but i plan on stopping for a month after wednesday. do you guys think .5 over 2 days will help/stop with any potential WD's?(only time i withdrawl'd was over summer, was doing like about 3g's of high quality ecp a day for a week or so straight, after doing about .7-1.2g's a day for like two days, then stopping for a couple days, then four days, stopping again, etc). it sucked really bad. i missed new years eve. i stayed in bed, felt this weird kind of depressed sick where i wasn't exactly sick but i still felt like horrid shit, i had no apetite or desire to drink, etc.(i imagine it was like a 2.5/10 on the WD scale lol).

on that note, for my last .5, i want to shoot it(not all of it, not trying to OD lol). i've never shot before. is there a noob guide on how to shoot tar? how hard is it going to be to both prep for the first time and hit a vein for the first time?(can i kinda just try multiple times to get it in the vein? how the fuck do you even know its in the vein?) how long does the high last if i do a slightly above normal dose(prob .25)

also, how is everyone? not that i know any of you here irl(except one person) but shit, everyone likes to talk about themselves even a little bit, and shit, i like to read and respond to people.

For the last two months I've been buying from Two Joints, and it has been a great relationship thus far. Over the seven-plus years of buying pills and now two of H, most of the dealers I've dealt with, icy would be a compliment. Mono syllabic responses for entire conversations: ""Yeah, What you want?, Roll through"" And that was about it, and its not as if they weren't efficient, or overtly rude, but rather apathetic towards me as a human being? I'm not sure if that is the correct way to word it, I suppose it was that they lacked any personality, and assumed I did as well.

Two Joints is a breath of fresh air. Granted, his stuff is quite good, and always consistently fatter than most of the D-Boys on the block, so that has something to do with it. However, say there was another guy whose stuff was just as good as Two Joint's, I would pick Two Joint's everyday of the week, simply because he treats me like a human being.

This leads into the other night, when I fully experienced just how far Two Joints is willing to go for his good customers (I bring ~900/wk via myself and friends). I had no car, and although I can usually find a fellow user in a pinch to do a bit of driving for some smokes, a bag, and a bit of gas, it was not happening.

Now he knew I was searching and put me in touch with one of his other customers, who had a ride, but no cash: Kismet!

Boring story short to the main point, Two Js ended up passing out (this has never happened) and wasn't picking up after we got to the dope spots on the westside. Driver makes a few calls, and since he was the wheels, we were going to his other connect. Now, I'm usually a good judge in character, but I was a bit less guarded as Two Js had vouched for this guy, so I wasn't too wary about Driver. And with my guard down I made the rookiest of rookie mistakes: Driver left with my money, as I waited at an all-night diner down the street where his supposed connect was, and a lovely 25 miles from my apartment. 

Seriously, so god damn stupid of me. I got my cup of coffee and sat at the booth facing the windows, and not even fifteen minutes in and I knew it. I knew that prick had gone off with my three bills and I let him. The funny thing is, is that the money wasn't even what pissed me off the most, no, it was the fact that Driver knew I was 25 miles from home, with no cash, and a dying cellphone. I get the being a grimy fuck, I get pinching a few too many bags and blaming it on the game, I get it, all of us, at one time or another has done something to get high that makes us shake our heads in retrospect. But the way he just just fucking plopped me on the side of the road at 4AM, man, fuck that.

However shitty the move Driver pulled though, it led to Two Js reaffirming, just barely, my faith in humanity. After four hours of sitting in the booth nursing W/Ds and blowing up half my contacts looking for a ride, Two J calls: ""I read your texts, I'm warming up the car, sit tight, text me your address."" By nine, Two Js had driven the 28 miles in rush hour from the city to the diner, and not only did he drive me back home, another 25 miles in the other direction, but he also hooked me up with the three jabs I was supposed to have purchased the night earlier with the now stolen money. I was completely blown away, never in my life have I met a dealer who would do something like that, I mean, the ride alone was beyond generous, but the three jabs for free?! Unreal.

So thats my new dealer Two Joints, the best-est in the whole wide world.",1393293136.0

I went to a friend's house like I did every weekend to score some H. I arrived with a big wad of chips and beer, I was prepared for a good night. I was so happy that night, I didn't know I would regret that shit forever. My tolerance was low, and I had injected the previous week, and I obviously misjudged my dose. As soon as I shot up, the wave of euphoria hit me, it wasn't the strongest I felt. I didn't see my overdose coming at all. I was eating chips, and then I closed my eyes. And HOLY FUCK WHY ARE THERE PARAMEDICS ALL AROUND ME! 

My reaction at the time was a clear, calm, I didn't think. I was driven to the hospital in an ambulance, all I could think to myself was disappointment, and the hurt that I would cause to my family. Needless to say, I made my parents cry, worry, feel like failures. Goddamn I'm not doing this again, but goddamn did I enjoy it. Almost regret I wasn't left to die. :)",1393285986.0

That is, up until recently when I had to move 500 miles after my divorce. 

I've got a bad back but I also am fairly hooked, so while I take it for its intended purpose I also take way more than I need when I can get away with it. After I moved I was able to find a few doctors that would help a little, but none of them wanted to take me on as a patient due to the chronic nature of my pain/habit. 

So I finally have an appointment with a Pain Management doc this week and I'm really hoping this works out OK. I've been getting by with subs lately, but lets just say that if I don't get anything from this doc I'm going to be in WD city. WD suburb at least. 

I was wondering if anyone who has had a PM doc might be willing to share some of their wisdom with me to help my odds. I always did well by my last doctor, so I know how to not look like a total junkie, but then again he wasn't a PM doc. I'm assuming these guys are much better at sniffing enthusiasts out. 

Anyway, I feel fairly confident about it, just a bit nervous is all. I wouldn't mind getting my grubby hands on something sweeter than what I was taking before.

white generics lets go over the basics here:
a.)have to suck off the coating because its so fucking hard to crush em
b.) the white generics have the the most disgusting taste to them when snorting them do to their filler ingredients
c.) they're a pain in the ballls to crush and have soooooooo much powder

pink regular ir 10mgs
a.) i dont need to suck the coating off
b.) i can use a credit card to crush em just like blues they brake up exactly the same however the pinkys taste better
c.) far less powder and the taste isnt so bitter, it actually sweet and doesnt have that sting like blues have when snorted
d.) far easier to snort and makke it fine powder the taste is similar to blues like mentioned before but god i love these so much better than blues. plus they're stronger than than blues
e.) doesnt clog your nose when snorting

long comparason short i absolutely dig the pinky opana ir 10mg far better than the white ir 10mg . how ever i feel like the white ones have a more potent buzz but that could be mt imagination playing tricks on me

soo tomorrow im getting my tumor removed, ive been in agony for the past two years due to the first time my surgeon completely fucked my lower spine up, i have a neuroma that is caused by weak scar tissue and when ever i sit its like sitting on the tip of your tailbone all by itself. i have to get that removed as well as another pilonidal cyst..

people with chronic pain... i need your help .. or anyone in general.. i take 6 x opana 10mg ir a day .. after surgery what should i tell them to give me since i have a tolerance?

I was hanging out with a friend today who has been using dope and other opiates for 10+ years. He was kind of boasting about how he could get 'pure' fent and that it was super bomb shit.

But we started talking about the strength of fentanyl and he starts telling me about how he doesn't like it because it's too 'weak'. So I'm like, uh, what? Fent is stupid strong dude. And he's like, no, I've taken like 300 mg before and I didn't even nod. So I'm basically stuck between telling him he's a. either full of shit or b. getting bunk shit or c. that fent is measured in MICROGRAMS, not mg, because of how ridiculously strong it is. I tried telling him it's what they use in surgery to anesthetize patients, what they use to knock out huge animals and he would just not accept the fact that he is completely and totally wrong. I was seriously in awe of how someone who has been using for so long was so dangerously misinformed and well, just totally full of shit in general. And this type of thing happens all the time.

It was really hot at work and then BAM I woke up in an ambulance. 

Anyways,  I never remotely combined anything with tramadol again and rarely ever touch the stuff and I never had a seizure again... Until today....

  I had an exam at 7:30 in the morning and I was scared I would oversleep as I often do, so I used some adderall to stay up all night. I took probably around 60 mg total throughout the night and into the morning. Anyways, I get anxiety from adderall, so I take hydrocodone throughout my study sessions to ease the anxiety without fogging my mind like benzos. This time, however, I only had a few of my vendors top quality kratom strands...

   So I ended up taking around 4 grams at 4 pm, 3 grams at 9 pm, 2 grams at 3 am, and 2 grams at 6:30 right before my exam. Now this is by no means very much kratom for me as I took subsequent doses when the anti anxiety effects were wearing off, but neither was the dose of tramadol. The exam went well and I went to the library to finish some homework. I was working vigorously and remember the library being extremely hot even when I was in there before the test. Anyways, the last think I remember is my notebook falling on the floor. I wake up to two campus police officers hovering over me and an ambulance stretcher being brought in. They tell me that I had a seizure... I was completely and utterly confused. I had no aura as epileptics usually have. 

 When I got to the hospital my heartrate was around 150, a combination of the extreme anxiety and confusion. First chance I got without a nurse at the hospital, I took a big dip out of my etizolam (no I am not addicted to benzos or thienodiazepines) and that along with my IV water (I wish the water would have went in my mouth and the etizolam the IV ;) had me feeling 100% better. My heartrate went back to normal!


 I just give this as a precautionary talk. I know I combined other seizure factors such as amphetamine and sleep deprivation. I just wrote this to make people aware that, like tramadol, other seizure factors may need to be avoided when taking Kratom. Hopefully vendors aren't still putting o-desmethyltramadol in there kratom, this is one of the more reputable vendors.


  Btw... My seizures were 5 years apart in case you were wondering. I even checked to see if there were many reports of seizures from kratom as it is speedy like tramadol, but I don't remember finding much. Now that I look at it, there are a few reports out there, but kratom hasn't been used nearly as often in the English speaking world as tramadol.
  


Also, the campus PD made a mess putting my stuff back up, but thye didn't say anything about the bottle of adderall with my girlfriends name on it blatantly sitting out in my backpack. Wow we are both lucky. She leaves the labels on for me as plausible deniability that I was taking them and so I can just say she left them at my house and I was taking them back to her.",1393405070.0

  It also is a product of the metabolism of hydrocodone by Pseudomonas putida M10, the bacterium used for oil spill remediation which also produces a morphinone reductase which can turn morphine into hydromorphone in a process which produces other active opioids such as oxymorphone, oxymorphol, hydromorphinol as intermediates.

Looking further at its wiki page:

  Certain variants of P. putida have been used in organic synthesis, the first example being the oxidation of benzene, employed by Prof. S. V. Ley in the synthesis of the cyclitol (+/-) pinitol.

Just for fun:

  Pseudomonas putida CBB5 can live on pure caffeine and has been observed to break caffeine down into carbon dioxide and ammonia.

I've come into contact with only a little bit of good tar when I lived in cali, and when I came back to Buffalo I much preferred the powder over the Tar still.

Kids in cali offered me $70+ per bag of powder that I could get them because they wanted it so bad. That seemed a little ridiculous but money wasn't a problem for thse kids. The junkies I knew back here in Buffalo were too pussy to actually do it, and I didn't really trust them with a couple hundred dollars anyway or them not to pinch the shit out of the bags.

But to the people who have tried both, or have had the option powder or tar, which did you prefer?

Even now the prices in buffalo for  tar are about $40 for .25g which is outrageous compared to anywhere from $60 for a bundle up to $130 for some fire.te

From what I've read, the way Tar is made, it's way fucking more dirty and less pure just due to the method. But powder is way more pure but Obviously gets million man marched on from the time it hits the streets til the time you get it.

So, simple question. Do you prefer to  **shoot** powder or tar?

I have 80 5/325 M365s, 10 332 Watsons and 10 of the new 20mg OP that I picked up over the weekend. I know my tolerance and metabolism very well but can't find any info on how long these little beauties normally take to break down if taken orally. I prefer duration vs peak with my oxycodone normally anyways since I get more unwanted side effects with oxy vs hydro while peaking and thus use the oxy for maintenance pain and the hydros for breakthrough time/days. 

I'm not just trying to get high, I legitimately am in a lot of pain all the time and can't get prescribed like normal so I'm stocking up when I can on what's available. I actually have a microplane grater which can be used to prepare these pills as a fine powder to be snorted (I did a bit that way last night to great success right before bed for a nod), I am just nervous to take one until I know how high it's gonna make me for how long, especially with my finicky digestive tract and inconsistent acidity making some pills hit me way harder than others from the same batch. I recently had this happen to me just taking my norcos when two of them got caught in my stomach with indigestion for hours and I took another two like 4 hours later when i started not feeling anything, before they suddenly hit me as if I'd IVed (massive rush, flushing, itching) and I promptly had to run to the bathroom and puke my guts out before lying in bed nodding for like 2 hours while my friend I was chilling with took care of my ass. 

I'm guessing every pill i took that day (40mg hydrocodone, 5mg valium, 200mg gabapentin) hit me all at once, and am just trying to avoid a similar situation since I know some time release pills are designed to give you an immediate dose followed by another dose several hours later, while others are meant to just dissolve at a constant rate like the MS Contin pills my GF used to get. Even with my issues I've never had issues with continued release pills like MS contin because they end up quickly in your intestine where they can continue to release at a steady rate more consistently, I just cannot find info on the duration of this mechanism at current since all the info I'm finding on google about them is how to abuse them for snorting/shooting",1393360777.0

So anyway, my doctor mentioned possibly putting me on Fentanyl Patches and taking me off the Oxy IR 10mg.

So my question is for those who have experience with Fentanyl Patches as a prescription.  How does it compare to Oxycodone?  Did you switch from Oxy to Fentanyl?

Shouldn't it be a similar experience?,"I drank PST every single day for 2 and a half years and I made a decision to stop. The last time I drank it was about 23 days ago, and I'm still feeling the W/Ds pretty strongly. I feel a deep tenseness and anxiety, the chills, and a feeling of lethargy. I feel like I can sort of see the light at the end of the tunnel from here, but for all I know I'll feel similar a week or 2 from now. The process is very very slow and I hardly feel any improvement from 1 day to the next. 

Anyways, I know PST has a long half life and that's why the W/D takes so long. It's still in the body for a long time so it takes longer for the body to adjust.

But what's the difference between that and weening off a short half-life opiate? Let's say I was getting off hydrocodone and I went from 10 pills to 9, 8..etc every day or every other day. I'm pretty sure I probably wouldn't feel much W/D at all and it would be fairly seamless. So why is getting off a long half-life opiate so much hell? 

Isn't it gradually decreasing from the body in the same way that weening would? You'd think it would be easier to get off of, since it would be a smooth decline, but in reality it's much worse. ",1393493238.0

This came after numerous trips to rehab and multiple near-fatal overdoses. Before this past week he had been clean, with the exception of one or two slip-ups, for over 16 months. The randomness of it all has been very trying.

My own drug use has always left me feeling guilty. Although some people say it's not possible to successfully chip, I always thought I did so. I've probably used dope 100 times over the past 4 years, never shooting and never using 3 days in a row, which were always my rules for it. Watching my brother and other friends struggle over the years with something that I was able to control always left me feeling awful, that I should have refused to use out of solidarity. He never knew the extent of my use of opiates, probably didn't know that I used at all, but that didn't stop these awful feelings.

Prior to his death this week I hadn't used since winter break, but today I went out and bought .6 or so, and spent my afternoon nodding on the couch while my family mourned. I still have a lot left, but I feel that this is one of the scummiest things I've ever done. None of my siblings have any clue that I've ever used drugs, and assumed my behavior was just my way of expressing my sorrow. I was very close to my brother, and his sudden and early death has effected me horribly. Do you think I'm making a bigger deal out of my using than I should be?

I am prescribed 25 MCG fent patches. I have been on for over a year and have good days and bad. Still in some pain a decent amount of time and nothing beats the feeling of going from pain to a little euphoria. 
As I understand it percocet and the fent patch hit different receptors. Does this mean I would feel something as small as a 5? Or does the patch bring up my tolerance to all opiates? I would really like something for breakthrough and a little more if I'm being honest.  I know the easy answer is talk to the doc but I broached it before and it is crazy how he was so quick to prescribe the patch but treated pills like taboo. I am scared to bring it up again because I don't want to come off as seeking (isn't everyone in pain seeking?) and jeopardize the relief I am getting. Which leaves the issue of finding something small as 5 or 10s but one prob at a time. 
Thanks for any help. Excuse any errors, I'm on mobile",1393481347.0

They'd been steadily decreasing my hours ever since I started a little over a month ago. I started off the first two weeks working nearly full time, down to twenty something, then 16 hours last week, and finally, four hours this week.





As far as me getting fired today goes, here's how it happened... I last worked on Sunday, which is the day our schedules for the next week are written out. So, having a pretty sharp memory, I looked at the schedule, and since I only was supposed to work one day this week, took a mental note rather than writing it down. Big mistake. Our paycheck comes weekly on Tuesday, but for some reason our manager didn't bring them in until today. So naturally, I spent yesterday bugging my manager about them. I had it in my head that I didn't work until tomorrow, and in my mind, I was so sure I was right. Imagine my surprise and dismay today when I came in to get my check, and I go to check the schedule to confirm the time I worked tomorrow, and I see that I actually was supposed to work **yesterday**, not Thursday. I said, ""Aww, shit!!"" and my shift manager came up with my check and told me we needed to talk. At that point, I already knew I was done. Aaaand so I was.





I then collected my check, cashed it down the road, and waited at the local McDonalds for my dboy to bring me a half G of some fire tar. I banged some, and then really didn't care about losing my job. Everything happens for a reason, right? Thank god my dad decided to help me pay rent. I really don't spend much on heroin, and even if I hadn't purchased any, I still would've had nowhere near what I need to keep a roof over my head. 





Next month, I will not have this problem. I moved into my new place right after my hours got cut, and I moved in, with help from family, without a penny to my name. I'm really counting my blessings right now. I have a roof over my head, food in my stomach, and I'm not out prostituting myself for dope money, like I was a scant few months ago. Normally, something like this would throw me through a loop and really fuck me up, but not this time. This time, I will stand on my own two feet. I will not be defeated.





First thing in the morning, I'm gearing up and getting my ass out there. I am dressing up in my most professional outfit, grabbing my binder full of resumes, and doing the damn thing. Please wish me luck oon my job hunt tomorrow, y'all. I got this.





PS, be on the lookout for some dope pr0n in the morning. Yay, needles and titties!

Since my hours got cut a few weeks ago, I've had less money for dope. So on payday, I usually scoop about a half g, which lasts me a day or two, then survive off of tip share buying dimes until my next check.





Well yesterday I had a brope drive an hour to meet me and go take me to pick up and cash my check, so we could go score some goodies. Well, we rolled up around 7PM only to find out my manager had already been in that day and didn't bring our checks. So I called his wife and asked when they'd be in. Supposedly today, but I hit up my managers son (who is also my coworker/shift manager) and no reply.




I am dying here man. I haven't bought a bag all week, and last night I scrounged up $20 so I could get my brope and I straight. It was some fucking fire. So naturally, he drops me off home, and he's all the way back to his place before I realize, hey, I don't have my dope. Of course I left my sack in his whip. -.-






So now, I'm sitting here, raping cottons and carpet farming, waiting for my damn paycheck. Its irritating the shit out of me. Like, I know my manager goes home with cash in hand every night from our restaurant... Your entire fucking crew depends on you to be there, each and every Tuesday, with our paychecks. Come on man. Fuck. My dope boy lives right down the street from my work, and he is always on and always has good shit. So that's driving me even more up the walls.

    I need some advice and I do not know where to start. I am a golfer that has been dealing with wrist issues the past 2 years. I went to an orthopedist/hand specialists and did the whole x-ray and MRI thing. Found nothing major and got a series of 2 local Cortisone shots (or something like that I can't remember). That didn't really help and the pain is still there. I moved to another city and it is getting to the point where I can't play nearly as much golf as I would like or need to (It is my hobby and I also entertain clients on the course) yada yada yada the reason I am posting here is because I found that Vicoprofin (which contains hydrocodone) worked wonders for my wrist. I broke my rib playing soccer a while back and got prescribed 30 of these. I only needed about half and the remaining half was in my medicine cabinet for a long while. My wrist was really acting up one day and I decided to try and take one of these pills before I played (even though the Doc did not prescribe them for that reason). Well, it WORKED. I played with almost no pain and I could actually enjoy myself again. I would really like to approach a doctor for a prescription but (insert awkward penguin) I am terrified of being viewed as a pill seeker because I am young (I have been playing golf since I was 5 and the wear and tear is there for sure). I feel like I have a legitimate need but do not know how to approach a doctor or even what kind of doctor for that matter. Does anyone here have any advice as to A. what kind of doctor and B. How to approach him about it besides flat out asking? I do not want to go and not get something that I know works for me and risk waisting money and time. Any advice would be MUCH appreciated.

If you're reading this you probably are not feeling too good, but hang in there buddy it will get better soon! **I AM NOT A DOCTOR SO BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU DO, KNOW YOUR BODY ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE SOME BENZOES.** What you will need for my routine and ranked from most important to least is below. If you ever see any of these around and have some extra funds, buy them and save them for when the day comes. Think of these items below as like a drug 401(k) and the earler you start collecting them the easier it is when the day comes: 

1. 2 or more 8mg subs (less is better IMO) [Required]
2. ~100 or more 2mg Loperamide Hydrochloride pills. You can get 400 for $9.99+ Shipping on amazon best way to go IMO.[Required]
3. Some benzodiazepines. IDEALLY you would get 20-80 mgs of diazepam (Valium) and 2-8 mgs Alprazolam (Xanax). If you can only get one or the other get Valium as it last longer and is better for what we need it for. [Optional] Also there are LEGAL (to own at least) research chemicals called Thienodiazepines which are supposed to be just as good as Valium. I myself am looking for a good source still, but I've heard good things. **If anyone has a good source for the US please PM me or post** (MODS: This should be okay since it is LEGAL to own and is not a scheduled drug, but if not please let me know and I'll delete this request ASAP)
4. Some weed. [Optional]
5. 10-30mgs of Adderall [Optional]-This is for Day 3 which seems to be one of the worst days for a lot of people motivation wise. I took it out of necessity and it helped me much more than I thought it would. 
 

Okay so long story short I have been doing opiates for well over seven years now and I'm relatively young 25-30 range weigh 200-250 lbs. Of those seven years I've had some binges, but the last two years have been daily use and LARGE doses. Now I used to wake up feeling like death and TERRIFIED of the withdraw I'd get if I ran out (it happened before NOT fun).  So I made my plan and it worked VERY well for me and I feel GREAT now.

**TIPS FOR THE ENTIRE PROCESS:**
 Leading up to your break try to taper down, **do NOT end on a binge before your break** or you will feel WAY worse, trust me on this. The more you are able to taper the better this whole process will be, but do NOT expect it to be pain free, it will be like having a cold if you do it right. Do not expect to have any enjoyment from the subs, you have to use them ONLY to not feel like shit, I think a lot of people take too much because they want that mental opiate high and if you do that you will have a bad time. Taper off the Subs aggressively, try VERY hard not to be on them for a week or more as you will become addicted to them and that is no fun from what I hear. Use Lopermide to your hearts content, it does not have any negative relationships with any of the other drugs and unless you stay on it for months and take extremely high doses there are no negative effects from it. Use Benzoes for sleep, not fun. Similar idea to the subs and if you get addicted to Benzoes its even WORSE than opiates from what I hear so don't take them for too long.  DO not expect to do much the first couple of days and try to eat healthy and exercise as much as you can. This is an aggressive taper and you will feel uncomfortable at times, but you will recover quicker than you think. 

**Day 1** Saturday-Woke up feeling like shit around 9:00am, last dose I had was at 8:00pm and I had taken a Valium (10mgs) the night before so that I could sleep in as much as possible. I Immediately took 26 mgs of Lope and was able to wait 2:00 pm before I had to take 4mgs of Suboxone. I smoked some weed throughout the day and around 4:00pm I took 4mgs of Suboxone as I still was feeling kind of crappy and felt more was appropriate. Around 11:00pm I took 2 mgs of Xanax, 10 mgs of Valium and smoked some weed to fall asleep. It worked and I was able to get some sleep. Tips: Don't expect to do anything this day, wait as long as possible before you take the Sub, but take lope right away. Also try to take as little suboxone as you can the less the better. **Total: 8mgs Suboxone, 26 mgs of Lopermide, 10 mgs of Valium, 2 mgs Xanax, Weed**

**Day 2** Sunday- Woke up feeling like shit again around 7:00am. Immediately took 30 mgs of Lope (raised it slightly) then was able to wait until 9:00 am to take 2 mgs of suboxone. Then around 1:00pm I took 2 mgs of Suboxone (tapering already). Again I smoked weed throughout the day and didn't do anything really. Felt a little crappy these days (1&2), but nothing *that* bad. You should only have mild withdraw effects tif you take enough suboxone and lopermide. I did NOT take a Benzo this night and as a consequence I did not sleep Tips: TAPER YOUR SUBS! Don't expect to do much today. This day was the worst for me. **Total: 30 mgs Lopermide, 4 mgs Suboxone, Weed, (I should have taken 10 mgs valium and 1 mg Xanax)**

**Day 3** Monday- Didn't sleep not because I felt that bad, but rather my body just wouldn't let me. I had work today so I couldn't just take Xanax as it was too late and I didn't want to feel all benzoed out at work. I took 30 mgs of Lope around 6:00am  and only 2 mgs of suboxone around 8:00am. Since I was tired and not only coming down off opiates, but had no sleep I had to take some measures I normally don't do. So I took 15 mgs of Adderall XR around 9:00am. This helped me tremendously and I would highly recommend it. I had a 16 hour work day and I felt great the entire time. Then to make sure I went to bed I took 3 mgs of Xanax, 10 mgs of Valium and some weed. Tips: If you can find some Adderall as it helped me much more than I thought it would, make sure you have some benzoes for it though as you will not sleep without them. **Total: 30 mgs Lopermide, 2 mgs Suboxone, 15 mgs Adderall XR, 3 mgs Xanax, 10 mgs Valium, Weed**

**Day 4** Tuesday-Woke up and starting to feel normal again. Still felt the effects from the benzoes, but starting to feel pretty good naturally. Took 20 mgs of Lopermide jut in case around 8:00am and then took 2 mgs of Suboxone around 10:00am once the Valium started to wear off. Then I smoked some weed when I got home and took 1 mg of Xanax and 5 mgs of Valium around 10:00pm. Tips: Really I have none for today, try to make this the last day you take subs if you can and expect to feel better today. **Total: 20 mgs Lopermide, 2 mgs Suboxone, 1 mg Xanax, 5 mgs Valium, Weed**

**Day 5** Wedesday- Woke up today and felt GREAT. Took 16 mgs of Lopermide, but I really didn't feel like I needed it. I didn't take anything else but weed later in the evening. Tips: If you feel worse take what you feel you need, but really try to use Lope in place of Suboxone and try not to use too many Benzoes**Total: 16 mgs Lopermide, Weed**

**Days 6,7,8,9,10-**These days all I did was take 16 mgs of less of lopermide and smoked weed. I started to feel *normal*. I will admit that I didn't sleep some nights, but I am a natural insomniac and I avoided taking more benzoes as I didn't want to get addicted to them. **Total: 16 mgs of Lopermide or less, Weed.**

What do you all think about a chipper at an NA meeting?  I know this isn't op-recovery.  But. You are ""my kind of people"".   

I'm not 100% into recovery at this point, but i'm a hell of a lot better than IV'ing stuff.  I'm back to chipping percs n vics when I can.

Am I the odd man out at an NA meeting???!!  Or..  Am I 'tolerated' showing up at a meeting with a much-worse-off friend and myself being a lil high/stoned?

Cuz... I was kinda high last night at the meeting.  Thought I caught a couple ""yea, you're stoned"" glances.  But..  didnt think much of it til now, 24 hours later.


I think that if my priorities are right, and my desires are right, then i'm there to be a part of that group.   My kids are #1. Way ahead of drugs. We spent my last $20 on pizza today, instead of vicodins. And I feel good about that.

I had a couple people who I thought were friends be totally shitty to me, had been feeling lonely and distant and overall losing faith in humanity and karma. I have always been a believer and a practicer of good karma. I give whenever I can because it makes me happy and it's the right thing to do. But tonight I found myself in withdrawal (a direct result of helping someone out who had no intention of ever returning the favor) and alone. Then out of the blue, without revealing too much detail to respect the privacy of the user, I found someone in my city who offered to help. Not because they were getting anything, not because they wanted something, but because they just wanted to help. Then they just happened to be by my SO who was able to procure it for me and will bring it home for me later tonight.

I mean seriously. I can't believe the odds of something like that happening! I feel so much better, not only because I'm not going to be sick in a few hours but because I feel like karma came back to me and I can keep doing good without feeling let down by shitty people. You can call me stupid or idealistic if you want, but man it is nice to have a little miracle happen. Things can get so nasty in the dope game, I really needed to be reminded of the good in people and the surprises life brings.

I wake up with someone all up in my face. I jumped back scured as all get out. I was instantly lucid and rational and realized what had happened.

Well here's a poem ya'll, stanazas are such a bitch to figure out on here so its just one big ole chunk.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm stuck at a brand-new bottom,

its even lower than the last

Nothing like a wishing well,

this bottom stems from my past.

I dream of a different tomorrow

since my days are full of hell.

Today I live my chosen existence,

and watch the people as they pass.

I wonder just what's the difference

between their story and that of mine.

*Is their's filled with all the heartache?*

*All the struggle and the tears?*

*Have they ever felt pure pleasure?*

*What its like to have no fears?*

I dream of a different tomorrow,

because this one can't be mine,

I run from a million troubles,

but they're never too far behind.

If I slept and met no morning

I wonder what would be left,

Would I simply be forgotten -

just an odd or even in a stat?

Would the obituary make a stranger weep?

While they relive a loss of their own,

Would they cry out their lost ones name?

Perhaps a daughter who she couldn't find the help?

Or maybe its a he - a Johnny or a Blake - 

who couldn't find his peace.

We build our walls of reasons,

strong as an old stone fort,

And wonder what would happen

If our reasons hit the dirt.

Is it the pain and the sick -

that feeling always near.

Or is it the crushing depression,

combined with stresses awful to meet.

Are those what keeps me on my ride,

this roller coaster of bigger falls,

that teases but never climbs so high -

as it did the first, oh, maybe 50 times.

I sat in awe at the height of the high,

but then I found out the ride was fixed. 

Full of such deceitful ways, yet it seemed too late

to try and change the way I spent my days.

So maybe it can't be concurred,

and I can accept my fate.

Or maybe its just my destiny,

Oh how much better does that sound!

Then again sometimes I get a feeling,

one yet too slippery to grasp, 

I can only manage a glimpse.

The glimpse looks a different tomorrow,

and its so unlike my past. And while I look

I hear a whisper - its pretty as the sea -

I close my eyes and try to hear,

Just what she could say to me.

I strain my ears and hold my breath

And suddenly a word, 

I think it is ""find your peace,"" as if that I've never heard.

I lash out in anger ""That's no great advice!""

But suddenly I think understood,

just what it is she said to me.

Its that there is no such magic -

no book or advice that can free,

no string of words for a great epiphany.

Suddenly it feels so tragic,

to continue to waste my life.

So I consider just what it would take,

to change my life. Support's a must, 

maybe some meds perhaps,

halfway houses and sober living to stop a relapse,

there's websites to read no matter the time,

and libraries full of books for free,

there's movies of hope and songs of strength,

and a future of wonder that now lays forth.

A life is too precious to die all alone

inside a public bathroom in McDonald's home.

So please just consider from time to time 

and when you do imagine a new tomorrow.

There can be a time where you've grown old.

And when you lay their on your death-bed,

with a photo of your grandchild in a hand,

your grown-up firstborn's palm grasps the other.

Smile as you close your eyes,  

and suddenly say to death,

*""I guess you think I've reached a proper end,* 

*but I believe its time that you hear,* 

*that with all this love I hold so dear,* 

*there just ain't no grave can hold my body down.""*

And when death grants you another last day, 

relive the difficulties of past, 

and thank your lover, children and mother, 

because now you feel peace at last.",1393545921.0
