Let me start off by explaining my situation. The other day I was in an accident at the fault of another driver and got really bad whiplash and had my chest hit the steering wheel along with my left side of my body being flung towards the drivers door. The pain from that extended all the way to my upper back and neck area from my arm. I hired an attorney through a very well known firm in my city. 

Long story short, I’m 21 years old and my attorney set up an appointment with a pain specialist that works directly for their firm. Being that I’m young, I really want to know how to get the doctor to prescribe medicine that will actually help with this pain. I’ve been taking Tylenol/excedrin/aspirin and most of those either don’t help or just mask the pain for a very short amount of time and then it comes right back just as bad. I took tramadol that a relative gave me and that makes me feel very funny. However, I was offered Vicodin (10/325) by another relative and that one worked the best for me by far. I didn’t feel any funny side effects and I was still able to work and do everything without my pain bothering me and it lasted a good while. 

However, I won’t be getting anymore from that relative so I will have to see how the appointment goes. I’m not sure how to tell my doctor that. I know I can tell them that the excedrin and other OTC medications didn’t work for squat but I doubt I can tell him I tried taking tramadol and Vicodin that wasn’t prescribed to me. 

Is there any advice I can take to try and get the pain management doctor to prescribe me those without sounding like I’m drug seeking since I’m only 21? 

Also, all of this is being paid for by the attorney (prescriptions, appointments, etc.) and I’m pretty sure the pain doctor has to do much as possible to help and win the case. Thanks. ",1542957815.0

I've posted a few stories on here about how I'm the dope fiend of our little family and my gf is the straight edged one. But I dont think my use had anything to do with her attitude today because she never mentions it on other days and never hounds me about it. 

Today it got to the point that I was plotting on how to leave her. Go to our apartment during the day tomorrow while she is out and pack all my shit and dip out. I'm still a little angry and I'm thinking like a fool because I know I'll never leave her. She hasn't left me yet so I owe her the reciprocation.

If you've never experienced a prostate orgasm,  it's the only way I've ever gotten multiple male orgasms, back to back to back, every single time I've done it.

If you've never lived it you really won't understand how hard it is to get out of, between all the social services discouraging upward mobility because they are literally in the business of keeping you homeless, and housed society treating homelessness like a contagious disease, only wanting to interact with you to tell you off, call the cops, or make themselves feel good with a handout.  If you try to talk them as a fellow human being it's like you don't ""know your place"".  I'm going to talk about how my wife and I got out but first I want to say if you are living in active addiction and struggling with homelessness, you have to address your addiction FIRST, and you are lying to yourself if you think you'll make it out without changes you are lying to yourself.  Not saying total abstinence is the only change possible, but you need some change and only YOU know what that is.  It's hard and scary, especially as a using couple and dealing with WDs when homeless but it IS POSSIBLE.  So without further ado here is our story:

Last year we had a super janky old 80s 38 foot Chevy Pace Arrow RV we were living in, strung out in the desert.  It would break down a bit and we would get stuck in like small town chain store parking lots.  Sometimes we would have to spend a full day riding casino buses back and forth just to buy shitty tar.  I look like Jesus so I made really good money flying signs, and usually got enough food while I was at it that I could spend it all on dope for us.  Shitty ass tar.  It breaks my heart remembering it, hustling away to stay well, all our hopes and dreams on hold.

Shit I wouldn't even read it at this point.,"The holidays for us hard drug addicts aren't times of joy and love, a multitude of variables forces us to take a step back and see just how shitty we're really letting things get. It's depressing. So ya know we get high. Which isn't changing our patterns of destructive behavior, therefore still letting things get progressively shittier, so we get depressed, etc. 

Stupid ass circle we're running ourselves around, guys. Every once in awhile somebody breaks the cycle, the holidays begin to be the most important time of the year, every year, because that once in awhile person is doing it right, and that's important. 

I don't know. I'm about to deal with my family head on, and though there's not a lot of us and my family is no stranger to addiction, it's still scary. I'm sitting here smoking literally a year old cigarette wondering how to make the best of this time.

May we show thanksgiving!","Usually around the holidays I am a lurker around here, envious of people with the good stuff enjoying great highs and holiday times.... usually I am drooling and just getting by, but this time I've been blessed, and I am going to express my thanks. I'm thankful that my dope dealer who almost always has fent garbage legless dope has had this $15 a bag stuff that is actually real dope, brown and chunky with legs for days and a delectable monster rush at just 2 bags with my tolerance... I'm thankful that he came up with this shit around this time of year when I'm ready to have a good last run and move on to sober living for the new year...

I'm thankful that I was able to score some good dope on this day of thanksgiving. The dealer only had 2 buns left and was pushing them both at a discount (probably so he could tell people he was out on Thanksgiving Day), and I only bought one so some last minute fellow junkies would have a chance at some quality holiday dope.

I was able to share some of this good dope with family that I love.  and we can all have a great day together, probably the last Thanksgiving we will all spend together in this home. My brother almost got arrested today for driving without a license, but they let him walk home with tickets. The car got impounded so we weren't going to be able to pick up my other brother for Thanksgiving dinner, but he got a ride now. 

The Lord has blessed us, so undeserving. Now we get to share together the blessings of good family and friends, good times, good food, good dope, and all the other blessings we have to be thankful for.

I hope everyone is having a blessed Thanksgiving, and sadly I know some are not, we all take a turn dancing with misery, and it is even more excruciating when it is during a special time like the holidays, where it seems most everyone is having a joyous time, but remember, you are not alone, if you are suffering. And on this day, hopefully you can still find something to find comfort, solace, and enjoyment in, something to be thankful for. And know that even those who are hooting and hollering for joy at such a time as this, have shared and known your deepest pains and sorrows in their own times of sadness and even despair.

So to all of those living it up with those you love, remember all you have to be thankful for, take none of it for granted tonight.

And to all of those alone and hurting, you are not alone, in that others share your pain and loneliness, and many folks among the partyers can sympathize and empathize, have gone through it, and are here with you too. 

We all have something to be thankful for, and many of us are blessed with a life replete with even countless blessings, and those of us more fortunate may we show thanksgiving by looking out for our fellow human!",1542907683.0

And because your car is a piece of shit the heat won't work once the engine is off. 

So you wait and freeze while dope sick for over an hour. All because your reliable plug is gone for the holiday.

Because unlike you even he has family that wants to see him on Thanksgiving.

And that's why you're sitting in the freezing car, because you plan to spend the night nodding off and ignoring how pathetic you are.

And you try to tell yourself that it beats an awkward family dinner but when you're dope sick and emotional you can't help but see it for what it really is.

So you go to r/opiates to complain.

All the while grateful to whoever invented the gloves that let you use your phone with them on.

After going clean for a month and suffering through brutal withdrawals, I was finally starting to feel normal again (the ""kicks"" stopped, and not constantly shivering but simultaneously sweating profusely to name a couple symptoms). I thought I was in the clear.

I'll rewind to 4 days ago; I was given a single oxy 80. Feeling relatively fine now having been a little over a month clean I thought, ""chewing one up for old times sake couldn't possibly hurt, right?"" Wrong. 24 hours later I was back in full blown withdrawal state; sweating, shivering, just complete hell. I'm back to 3 days clean and feeling much better, the withdrawals didn't last nearly as long this time but they were equally as brutal nonetheless. 

Anyways my question is, will I ever be able to just enjoy oxy every now and then without inducing withdrawals? Like will my brain ever go back to a state where I can enjoy a buzz infrequently without inducing a withdrawal every time, or am I forced to go 100% clean? If I waited 3 months and did some oxy, will I still withdrawal? A year? Anyone's help would be greatly appreciated. ",1542905751.0

I was wondering if you had any advice to give regarding a doctor that won’t listen to me.

I am currently on a 25 microgram/hr patch. The patch doesn’t see to last as long. I brought this up to him as well as the fact that I experience an increase in my pain and some withdrawal symptoms. I asked for a bump in my dosage, but he was like, “Nah.”

Any advice as to what I should do? I don’t want to doctor shop as I don’t want it to seem like I am shopping around.

Do any of you all have any recommendations? I also have a GI doc but he flat out refuses to prescribe anything.

The things I did in this post are not recommended and should not be attempted.

  This is a recount of the day i took the following drugs:
-An unknown amount of Fentanyl 
-Approximately 12 mg of Percocet 
-Approximately 1 g of Marijuana (OG Kush)

  It all started when I got home from work and my girlfriend informed me that a friend of hers had given her about 1/3 of a 50 mg Fentynal patch (Not 100% sure of actual dosage). She told me she had applied the patch to her skin, with no results. She then told me she had thrown the patch away inside a rubber glove. Not one to waste free drugs regardless of my knowledge of them, I began to find the discarded patch. When I retrieved the patch I will be the first to admit I knew little to nothing of the patch other than it had led to the death of one of my favorite musicians (Mac Miller)
  I began to research the patch with no luck finding a guide on how to safely smoke the patch. So I decided to go for it anyways knowing I had an already established opiate tolerance. I began smoking my OG Kush and started by putting the most miniscule amount inside my marijuana pipe (about the size of a small bug). The only effect I noticed was a little numbness on my tongue when exhaling smoke. After that I moved up to about a fingernail size peice to see if I could get the desired effect. So I sat there and smoked and everytime I smoked a little more I started to notice a body buzz similar to a hydrocodone high.

Aproximate amount consumed:
-About .5g of OG Kush
- Approximately 1/6 of Fentanyl patch

  At this point I felt really good and decided to take a break until the drugs wore of. After the high subsided I crushed and snorted about 12 mg of Percocet. 

Approximate amount consumed:
-Approximately 12 mg of Percocet 
-About .25 g of OG Kush

  After enjoying my high for the next few hours everything had wore off and I decided. I was going to smoke the rest of the patch (Approximately 1/6 of the patch) at once to see if I would get a stronger effect. So I packed my pipe with the remaining. 25 of OG Kush topped with about 1/6 of a Fentynal patch. I smoked it all at once and the effects were immediate. The smoke was mouth numbing and the high seemed to stack with the previously consumed Percocet. I then began to blissfully nod off.
  Although I had a rather positive first experience with Fentynal it could have gone horribly left. I beg that no one repeat what I did in this post because in complete honesty I had no idea if I'd be enjoying a high or taking a trip to the hospital. Be careful out there friends. Dont be careless like me. It effects people with different levels of tolerance differently. So what worked for me might kill you. Just be careful out there.",1542877103.0

Prior to driving a total of 6 hours (3 hours each way) I managed to arrange a trade for some v 48 12 Qualitest brand 30s

inb4 I’ve been sober for 4 months did 5 days detox and a month on suboxone and discontinued it 6 days ago. 

So after going through about 2 days of real wd I decided to drive to a buddy that was as I said before 3 hours away from me for a total of 5 Roxy. 

First off when I got there he only had 4.... I ended up doing 2 on the drive back to my house and 2 when I arrived home. And nothing. No pupil dilation, no itchiness, nothing... definitely not even a fragment of euphoria.  Can you imagine my frustration and will to die?

Seriously though. I’m no novice to oxycodone and have had my share of experiences with different brands of oxy w/ that said I am more familiar with Rhodes pharma white 30s, a215s mboxs n the e8s ... e8s being my fav of those listed. 

Has anyone had more experience with the v4812s? It seemed legit and I did see a picture of the script bottle before purchase but when I broke down the pill it contained more white specks than I had originally thought. Also I’ve noticed through my own research v4812s are a slightly darker blue. The ones I purchased were of the same light blue color as a genuine a215. The imprint was deep it did not rub off not even with a wet finger there was no smell to the pill and the drip was weak only slightly bitter same for the taste as I tried some sublingual for taste and it was a very weak bitterness.

First time was with the worst pain in my life.  They mercifully shot me full of dilaudid pretty quickly.  

With no prior opiate history whatsoever. 

Holy. Balls.  It was like every rainbow on earth came in my veins.  I finally got it.  This is what all the ruckus is about.   

Over two weeks I got two hour morphine shots followed by regular oxys.  Learned what a nod meant.  Shit made the ordeal almost worth it.

The next time I had an episode I got dilaudid to start again, 3mg IV every two hours. Fucking amazing.  But the euphoria wasn't quite there.  Okay, I know substances. Never gonna be like the first time.

Third time I got morphine shots.  Zero euphoria and almost this cramping, ""unnnngh"" feeling spreading up my shoulder and into my spine and neck.  Great nod after, but the come up wasn't pleasant.  ""Maybe morphine kinda sucks?""

Well, just got discharged from two days of 1mg dilaudid IV every 3 hours and it felt the same way.  It hurt (although kinda in a good way) going into my bloodstream and kinda melted into a sore nod.

Anyone else experience something like this?  Is this what it would feel like if I shot H?  Might keep me off it....  might.  Oxys still give me great euphoria.

Also I know constipation is a thing but also difficulty pissing?  They were pumping me full of IV fluids and I could barely piss half a bladder load at a time.  Been 13 hours since my last dose of D and I am still catching up on pissing.  

Also this time I itched like a morherfucker.  Thanks to browsing this community I took some Benadryl and it seemed to help me not scratch myself raw.

I’m just hoping some of you boys/girls can relate to your mates abandoning you because of your addiction; even though it isn’t harming them. I would appreciate some input: share your thoughts (this was a text message and is 100% truthful),"Bra u don’t have to act like u boys give a shit mate. Do you know how I spend my days? Waiting for my job to call cos my mates don’t want anything to do with me, even though I’ve done nothing to them. 

Yeah I’ve got an addiction problem and I’ll lie about my use (if I don’t I get judged by you boys- U know, the boys sometimes doing bags 4 days a night on a week day, missing days of work).

Just remember when you had your problem bra and no one understood that you were suicidal. I took u into my home and made sure you were okay. I called your mum to chat to her about you, cos I was worried and I love you cunt. I was there for you no matter what and u know it. Was that your fault that you were depressed;no. The boys thought so, but I always defended you. 

My shit doesn’t affect you boys. And I really don’t need a lecture from any of you boys when none of you can even bother to check to see if I’m okay; even when I was in hospital. If you boys were there I’d happily listen and be honest: if I’m honest, I get avoided. 

Wanna know one of the main reasons that I go back to drugs at this stage in my life (and I rarely do em, or even drink for that matter) It’s because  I’m that lonely that I barely have a friend, all because of a problem that I have and I am trying to help. I don’t steal from my friends, I just harm myself: I don’t even talk about drugs or use in front of anyone. I’m always truthful when I tell use that I’ve been clean; if I make one fuck up, I’m a liar and the other times don’t matter; it’s like I’ve never been clean.

If I fuck up once, I’m a liar. Marcus won’t let me see his kid (which I can understand), I get invited no where and to be honest bra that’s fine. Don’t try act like it affects you mate, cos if it did, you’d check up of me every now and again, but you couldn’t even be fucked returning a phone call of mine; I came to your place and everyone is there drinking ( U just pretended like I didn’t call) 

Just remember who was there for you when no other cunt was. Don’t bother replying to this, just think about where I’m coming from. I’m not mad at you mate, I have a problem and the only person to help me is my Mum, dad and myself. I don’t want to be an addict but I can’t even talk to use about it because I never get believed. 

There’s no need to get offended because it’s not a dig; it’s the truth. Fergus, Mohun, Venter all have benders on the needle but “they’re just having fun, hey” it’s not like they aren’t worthy of being your mate, hey? I don’t even touch the needle anymore mate, but it doesn’t matter cos you boys have done everything for me, hey? I don’t expect help from use, I just want my mates back. Same thing happened to Brodie. You ask for help and all the help you used to have just tells you to go fuck yourself.",1542860701.0

It didn't have the look of a really used dope spoon but the backside was a faded black. 

I washed it with water I had in my cup holder and ran my fingers across it to see if any soot would rub off which it didn't. I took this as a sign of being good to go. Holy shit that first bite was absolutely disgusting... seriously one of the worst things that I've ever tasted.

I have noticed on several occasions when taking some of the newer generic brands specifically the Novel Labratories brand "" N 358 hydrocodones. Man I feel like absolute shit if I take more than 1 of these at at time. I get histamine type reactions and intestinal issues and just over all feeling like I could crawl out of my skin. A very unpleasant sensation. The side effects are mild, but damn I will be getting another brand next month when I get a refill. I talked to the district manager of my CVS and they agreed they would order whatever I wanted. Unfortunately I did not think of this until after I got my prescription filled and I'm stuck with these until next month.

Do any of you guys have these kind of issues with particular brands of opiates? If so what brands cause you problems or work better for you? Personally for me anything Watson, Mallindkrodt, and Qualitest has been absolutely amazing for me, and have zero side-effects with all of those brands.

Anyway... the last like 3 times he has an excuse and is short on the money..usually short by 2-3 bucks, at most $5.. Sometimes he tells me, sometimes he waits till he sees me. He's always very sorry and will get me back..blah,blah,blah.. I just let him stop to my office, I go to him and he says, ""I owe you 5""...I just shake my head and say whatever..

SO...my question is..should I just stop fucking with him? I mean its not the money that bothers me, its the principal. Its like since he knows we are friends, he can take advantage of me...What do you guys suggest? Tell him no more till we are squared away? Whats your opinion on dealing with your friends not regular customers? Thanks!",1542824621.0

Please. Looked everywhere.,"Hey guys so I’ve been scavenging the internet for three days trying to figure this out. I searched everywhere even Reddit. But there is just so MANY conflicting answers.

If somebody can please make it as simple as this I’d greatly appreciate it
So I know how to convert oxy and hydro, for example I used to take 90 mg hydro and when I moved on to oxy I calculated and experimented and found the equivalent to be 60 mg oxy

But for opana, there’s soooo much conflicting info. And all these numbers get mixed up in the route of administration (oral, insufflated, etc)

So let’s say I’m going to be snorting these opana

How much would I need to snort that would be equal to 60 mg oxycodone???

Like if somebody could tell me for example 5 mg snorted opana = 60 mg oxy it would be such a help. 

Thank you! 

Cuz I’ve heard all these answers from 1 mg - 10 mg !!!! I’m so lost just wanna be safe ",1542823861.0

And other prescription drug questions,"I have a few prescription opiates: oxy 10mg, codeine 30mg, DHC 30mg and a couple of slow-release morphine 10mg capsules (that I don't get much from). 

1) I've noticed different effects and after-effects from each - like oxy hits hard but leaves the system quickly, codeine seems 'cleaner', less of a scuzzy gnarly feeling the next day, while DHC makes me feel grumpy. Is this in any way correct or is it all in my head? 

2) My tolerance has gone up recently. I have an opiate binge once a week. Used to be I could get nicely high from one oxy or 120mg codeine/DHC, but now I'm needing two oxys and 90mg codeine to prolong it, or 180mg codeine/DHC. It's annoying and I'm wondering why - does codeine stick around in the system for over a week? I always thought it left the bloodstream after two days or so. 

3) How can I reset my tolerance? Is it simply a case of taking a break? And if so, will two weeks be enough or am I looking at a month clean? 

4) Are there any lasting effects from using opiates like this? I know from past experience that benzos are pretty troublesome - I feel dreadful the next day, and a couple of days after that I'll feel real crap and anxious and stressed out. With opiates I feel awful the next day, bad mood, fuzzy, but after that it's plain-sailing.

My knees, back, legs are SO achey most days. I barely have any entergy at all. This has been going on for years..... but im “young”.... so how could this be?
One day when I was in a lot of pain, a friend gave me a loratab... worked so well and I was out of bed cleaning up. This went on and on and now I am taking oxys here and there because they HELP me. I really dont even get “high” so to say off of them. They aleviate the pain and give me a boost of entergy to where I can get through the day and be somewhat productive. I am buying off the street because I do not know what else to do. I have had issues with kidney stones over last 5 years and I noticed my back pain got worse after having my daughter in 2013. 
When I tell people this, they LAUGH at me. I say I feel like a 60 year old in my 20s because I do and my body just hurts. I dont know why. At any annual doctor visit, when I start to discuss this, they think its a joke and just brush me off. I cant blame them, I “look” healthy and again I am only 26.

I cant visit a pain management clinic because I have Medicaid and no one accepts it nor do they accept cash payments where I live. Really not sure what else to do or where to start.

This was the hardest detox of my life, and I have come off 1g H a day straight to subs as well as fentanyl and oxymorphone, none of those came close.

One of the synthetics has an effect on the cardiac opioid receptors, causing a panic reaction upon detoxing as early as 8 hours, even before the longer lasting synthetics are out of your system.

From what I experienced some of the half-lives are insanely short and some long.  The long acting compound takes 48 hours to leave your body compared to H which is more like 12-24h.

What worked for me is dropping my tolerance from 100 a day to 40/30/20 over the course of a few days with someone else dosing me.  This was the most painful part - fucking horrible.

Once my dose was down to 20, I started taking 2mg subutex an hour before picking up a 20 bag a day.  After a few days of this I lowered to a 10 bag, adding more and more time between dosing subutex and fentadope.  This is the Burnese method and it is critical for detoxing from mixed fentadope.  Be careful as it is an easy thing to fall into just continuing to use ontop of the subutex.

Use your pupils as a guide and make sure they are not pinned or you are using too much fentadope in your Burnese detox.

Having subutex in my system really helped, it blocked the short acting opioid which caused compulsive dosing so I could actually just do a small amount a day to retain the long half-life effects.

Once I stopped taking fentadope, there was a period of 3-4 days where I had horrible withdrawls but nothing compared to without subutex in my system.  I was sweating so much my tshirts had dark stains in the pits after 12hs.

I could not sleep more than a few hours and had horrible chest tightness as well as restless legs so bad I would do squats every few hours, even though I had tons of subutex in my system and it had been days since I had anything.  This is unique to fentadope, I never had WD effects when fully induced on subutex in the past.

I have now been stable on subutex with no fentadope for a decent amount of time and it is getting better and better every day.

This shit is no joke and I really feel for you guys who have large habits, I hope this can help.  I was only on 100 a day for less than a month, I can't imagine what its like for you guys that have done it for a while.  From talking to other users and dealers of this stuff, everyone says its impossible to detox from a big habit and jail then eventually the hospital for seizures/secondary WD effects is the only thing getting people clean.

The game has changed and we need to recognize that, as medical professionals are way behind and analytical labs are mostly useless in determining which synthetics are present.",1542782011.0

But I do follow this sub everyday and am hopefully excited to be getting high in a weeks time (Hopefully)!

Anyways a little background regarding vivitrol, I first got the shot back in February and I tried getting high in April after 33 days with no success and that was only after 3 months.. now fast forward to now, I just received my last shot on October 23rd (8th consecutive) and will be trying next Thursday the 29th, Friday the 30th, and mainly Saturday the 1st. What are the odds I will feel at least 80% of the effects 37-39 days after last shot. I just bought 80 grams of Kratom on Saturday and took about 8 grams and didn’t feel a thing.. I was hoping to boost my tolerance starting Monday a tad to prevent risk of OD and to catch a small buzz in the meantime. I figured I’ll wait to Monday to try the Kratom again to see if I’ll be able to even feel a thing.

I guess my question is for people who were on vivitrol, how long after your last shot were you successfully able to get high again? I’ve read anywhere from 28 days to 40 days. Thank you and happy nods to everyone!",1542767134.0

My tolerance got fucked a while ago and recently decided it's time to stop.

Back still hurts like fuck but the pills weren't doing shit anymore so I had no choice really.

I initially tapered but didn't  save enough script so started withdrawing once I ran out. Withdrawals were effecting work so I bought some etizolam and for the past week have been taking 2-3mg a day (.5-1mg at a time). It's been a miracle. 

Now I know I'm an idiot, but I have the next 2 days off an just really want to take some opiates. I got a new script 3 days ago and I've been a good boy and haven't touched them.

 Basically my question is, when can I safely pop a couple pills? I know opiates + benzos is a big no no so I want the etiz to be gone plus I don't wanna ruin the dope high. I've only taken  half an mg today and that was 7 hrs ago. Thanks.",1542760847.0

I have plenty of experience with pharmaceutical opioids and have done most of them, I have however, never tried heroin. Which is what I thought this was, just another form of heroin.

I didn't know until today that it also has fentanyl or carfentanil in it.

So I took one inhale off tinfoil and that's all I needed, man I was high. I was surprised at how high a single hit could get me. Couple hours later did it again. And that was that. Quenched a curiosity I've had for awhile.

Today I'm at work and I'm suddenly freezing! Almost like im running a fever. 

Is it possible this is because of this stuff I smoked last night? Figured after effects like this typically only showed up with habitual use.

It was a very shady situation and we know the people that were with him that night are hiding something. I know of three people there at least:  Female 1: the mother of his 3 daughters. Male 2: her current boyfriend. Male 3: 2's friend. I know male 2 that was there despised him and bragged about killing him as a joke supposedly. The police in the town he died are crooked and the cop that handled the case was friends with the homeowner where he passed. (He would buy them food, buy drugs from them, and warned them they were going to receiving a warrant so they could run, etc.) The cops did nothing.


Yesterday the homeowners newest ex posted on Facebook that he was selling the secret how my cousin died. 1 got very defensive and told us all to ignore him but it reignited our anger. She never told us what happened that night. As far as I know she is still denying she even used. The only thing I remember she admitted is they let him die in his eldest daughters bed then let her sleep in it. Fucked up, right? A year before that I remember her daughter finding needles and asking me grandmother why she has needles like the nurses. CPS was called and nothing was done. She's sober now and still not talking. We have so much hearsay but I won't believe any of it. 


We've heard he was taken upstairs and was shot up again by male 2. We've heard he collapsed downstairs and they carried him upstairs instead of calling 911. 1,2,3 has never said a word to us but according to others have talked. We don't know what to believe. We do know he was shot up when he overdosed and couldn't do that himself. 


My cousin had not been doing heroin very long and didn't know what he was doing and they were aware of that. I think that's everything. Here is the link to the toxicology report. Thank you for any help.

Hope everyone is good !

I been using opiates for like 3 or 4 years, (mostly codeine and dihydrocodeine i have a weak tolerance and i try to keep it), some friends use with me sometimes.

Last night i was with on of my day one friends, we were smoking watching dumb shows on yt, we took codeine before. 
And all of a sudden he got up and told me ""bro i'm not feeling good at all"" , he was nodding extra hard , we had to go outside in the rain and cold so he could be better and more awake, then i gave him sugar, ice cream anc activated charcoal. That scared me a lot because he is kind of ""solid"". He was good after an hour btw.

So my question is, how, and where could i procure myself narcan/Naxolone in EU ? Because we never know whhat can happen. It can save a life so i want Narcan, i don't want my friends or myself to die.

Peace,have a good night, and be safe opi fam.",1542741136.0

And bare with me cuz it’s a kind of long explanation, and my questions will be at the end. I’m fairly naive when it comes to opiates. My husband is an addict and has been for over a decade.  He’s been in and out of active addiction since we have been together (5 years) he’s relapsed on IV heroin a couple times in those 5 years,  The past year or so he’s been taking pain killers because he hurt his back 2 years ago snowboarding and he has protruding disks and hip problems. The first year of his injury he did everything to try and help his back BESIDES using pills, and they didn’t work, so for the last year he has been taking oxycodone and OxyContin to help with pain. (Sometimes instant release, sometimes the extended release OxyContin). I left last night to stay with my family for the night and my husband didn’t come with me because he had to work today. His buddy came over and spent the night, he buddy recently got out of prisons and has probably been doing heroin... I returned this morning and found a wrapper for a 3ml needle, and when I confronted them about it, the buddy said it was his, and that it was a needle intended for narcan that a friend gave him and that him and my husband had most CERTAINLY not been using IV drugs.   Now I’m not an idiot, so I know that they probably were. They also said that a 3ml needle is way too big and Ymir would not be ideal to use for injecting heroin, which I have confirmed with a friend. It would not be an ideal needle, but still doable. So... here’s my question: if my husband takes a 12 panel UA that I bought, I would expect the THC and the oxycodone tests to come up positive. There is also a test on there that says “opiates” and that test includes codeine, heroin, and morphine. If he did junk last night, the “opiates” rest would be positive correct? If he didn’t, the only tests that would come up positive would beTCH and oxycodone, which I know he takes.  Is my logic correct? Is there anyway he can get around this and try to convince me that the “opiates” test is from the pills? Please help. The test Is called a “quickscreen at home drug test 12” and the drugs it tests for us listed on the side as follows; 

Amphetamine
Barbiturates
Benzos
Cocaine
Ecstasy 
Methadone
Methamphetamine
MDA
opiates
Oxycodone
Phencyclodine (pcp)
Marijuana (thc)

I've been dreading stopping heavy oxycodone use for a while, especially since the internet is filled with horror stories with people in bathtubs puking and shitting themselves. But I finally started (well, stopped).

I took 300mg oxycodone around 4-6 times daily, so 1200mg to 1800mg oxycodone oral daily (not retard, instant action) and around 5-6 times 300mcg fentanyl sublingual daily (Abstral it's called). I already didn't have any high from this anymore (but had in the past), but I didn't want to up my dose, mostly because of the cost. I've taken this for about 6 months without a high, and before that about 18 months starting with 20mg and increasing regularly to keep the high (ending up at the above amount).

So two weeks ago I started quitting the fentanyl and limiting my oxycodone intake to 400mg a day (4x100mg). I had expected to feel some withdrawal in the week that followed, but there was NONE. However, perhaps the 10mg valium I started taking was masking this? Just a single one with breakfast, it seems unlikely that a single valium is masking the withdrawal symptoms, but that's the only thing I can think of. I felt like I took a 10mg valium, nothing more and nothing less.

Then the next week (the last week until yesterday). I've tapered down to a single 20mg oxycodone cap daily in the morning plus the one 10mg valium. I have noticed my bowels are waking up a little, so I'm taking 4mg loperamide for this (afaik this is also an opiate that doesn't go into the brain, but does work on the bowels).

Since i didn't feel bad at all, yesterday I decided to skip the daily 20mg oxy as well as the 10mg valium (but kept taking 2mg loperamide) to see what would happen. Nothing happened. I repeated this today as well, and I feel completely fine.

So none of this matches with the stories I'm reading of detoxing from opiates (or the official information, like [https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/opiate](https://americanaddictioncenters.org/withdrawal-timelines-treatments/opiate)). Oxycodone has a \~4hr half-life and I should go into withdrawal after at most a day without, right? Besides my bowels acting up a little (and I mean a little) and my shit being a little softer (I guess going back to normal) than the previous ""normal"" (which was a little too hard for comfort), I feel totally fine. No symptoms or cravings at all.

What is going on? Is the withdrawal still coming maybe? How can I go down from a 1200-1800mg oxycodone habit to nothing in two weeks and have zero withdrawal symptoms? I'm not taking any other medications that could explain this.

It has crossed my mind that if I were taking fake oxy that was not an opiate at all that could explain this, but I know 100% certain it's real as I Rx it and get it from different pharmacies myself (don't ask). Also my girlfriend was suffering from horrible menstrual cramps yesterday and I gave her \~4mg (slightly less than 1/4th of the contents of a 20mg capsule) and she was high as a kite for most of the day (she has no tolerance).

Now, I'm obviously not complaining that I'm not feeling absolutely horrible right now, but I am quite interested in why I don't seem to have any withdrawal symptoms at all. Anyone have a clue how this can happen? I haven't found any stories matching mine, just misery.

I was going to school out of state and was coming home for Christmas. I packed up my suitcase and bag of oxys and hopped on a plane. Took 80 mg before I boarded. The flight attendant knew my dad (he’s a pilot) and offered me free drinks. Woot! So I accepted. 

4 drinks and one hour, 10 minutes later I land. I’m picked up by my mom who can A, smell the alcohol on me, and B, knows I’m fucked. She sighs and goes, “Ugh...here we go again.”

She takes me home and relatives are there from out of town. I get crazy nostalgic and am loving everyone. I’m shouting people’s names and giving them hugs. Basically being a fool. Snorting oxys whenever I get a chance to go to the bathroom.

We all go out to dinner and apparently I’m shouting across the table at my cousins and laughing my ass off, just embarrassing everyone around me. My pupils are pinned, I look tore up...just a mess.

We get back to the house and start our Christmas Eve party. I’m making a fool out of myself the entire time, laughing at everything. My cousin convinces me to hook him up with some oxy, so we sneak off and snort a few. Now he’s lit and everyone knows who gave it to him. 

My aunt (not his mom) loses her shit and shouts, “u/TheBackPorchOfMyMind, you’ve ruined fucking Christmas!” And busts out the door and slams it shut. My cousin goes, “Oooooooooo.” And starts laughing. I start laughing and everyone in the room just glares at me. 

My mom runs up to me and goes, “Where are the drugs!?” And begins to try and search me. Mind you I’m 21 years old at the time. I have my drugs on me and I don’t want them to be taken away, so I run out the door. I called a literal taxi as Uber wasn’t a thing, I go back in and pack up my bags on Christmas Eve, have the taxi drive me to a hotel I used to work at. My buddy still works the front desk and tells me he’ll comp my room. So I spend Christmas Eve getting drunk at the hotel bar.

I woke up the next morning and had the shuttle take me to the airport. I spent Christmas alone on a plane back to home. Got high some more and life went on. 

That is how I ruined Christmas. 

tl;dr I got high and ruined Christmas.

 I am unable to get high off of smoking heroin anymore. I've been using for about a year and I just smoke currently. I have been unable to get high since August, like one day I just stopped feeling it. I can nod out, but no euphoria or pain relief. Will IVing help with that, and if so, will it be just a temporary fix?



Rant:
I had a good thing going for a while, I've been using for about a year now, and I always went through the same dealer because she was reliable, and good to me. We became good friends pretty quickly. Anyways, last night I called her, and asked her to deliver as I have a thousand times before. While shes on her way, she stops answering my calls, which is an immediate red flag. If she's not asleep she answers instantly. Like, 6 hours later, her friend texts me from her phone, and tells me she got arrested for outstanding warrants at a traffic stop.

Fuck. My good friend and only reliable dealer who I have a year long relationship with is in jail. I'm not one to show emotion, at all, but I cried for her, knowing she was detoxing in a jail cell while I was blowing up her phone.

 She was part of a network of dealers, so while I'm worried about her, I still have to get my fix. I called one of her associates, and he said he'd hook me up. He told me he was on his way, responded for a while, then just went dark. Again, not like him at all. I haven't heard back since.

So yeah, I think my entire fucking network got taken down, and now I have to start over at street level. I have no idea how to cold cop, but it's necessary at this point.

It's not all bad though, I have enough Suboxone to last me for 2 months. While I hate subs, it's better than going sick. Also, I live in in the West coast, in a smallish city with lax laws, with an extremely overcrowded jail, so if it's not too serious she'll be out in a couple days.

I'm working on getting a clean rig and 2 points just to give to her the second she's out. My issue is finding the 2 points.",1542716860.0

So I've been using heroin off and on for about 2 years now. My longest clean time has been a little less than a month. My relapsed started off with a couple beer, that lead to me cooking up some crack. (Moving around powdered doughnuts at the time) lol Idk, that's a new one for me too.. Haha, anyways... I skipped the soft and went striaght for the hard. Mind you I havent done it in over 9 years. So that lead to me doing it every other day.. yadayada..EVERYDAY.. I fckn hated the comedown so I eventually started back up with the dope to soften it. Then that eventually led to an everyday thing.. which leads me to today.. havent skipped a day and it's probably been a month and a half, if not more.. 
   I need fucken help. And I'm scared to quit due to a possibility of having a seizure since it's been such a long binge. Should I be fine? I was planning on writing the hard and then dozens day or 2 after. Hoping for some advice and answers..

9yoll4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9yoll4/goofballing/,18,https://redd.it/9yoll4,EitherSmoke,Goofballing.,"I saw a recent post where i guy mentioned goofballing and it got me curious. Have many of you on this sub tried goofballing? For those of you that don't know, goofballing is mixing heroin with methamphetamine. You don't need to shoot it for it to be a goofball, you can also snort or smoke the two substances at once.

You might be thinking, ""Why would someone want to do that?"" Well, there is a few reasons. 

First, mixing heroin with meth gets rid of that edgy/wired/possible paranoid feeling that meth can bring. It actually feels like a very relaxing meth high. 

Secondly, it is way more euphoric than taking either substance by itself. Thirdly, its better than speedballing (coke & heroin) because coke only lasts an hour or so, so you would need to redose the coke. Also, coke overpowers the heroin. 

It obviously isn't the safest combination so you should start out with small amounts of the two substances, especially because i think they both potentiate each other. 

I've only done a goofball one time. I mixed 50mg of ice and 50mg of heroin into one line and snorted it. The meth didn't over power the heroin and i felt both substances for a few hours before the heroin sort of wore off and i was left with a very relaxing meth high. 

I don't recommend this high, i just wanted to explain my experience with it incase some of you were curious about goofballing. 

How many of you have goofballed and enjoy it? ",1542687536.0

I have been hooked on Tramadol for about 3 years now, it started out with me getting a prescription because of pain after a surgery. But quickly turned in To buying illegally since its so abundantly available where i live.

It has varied wildly in dose, from first beeing on a steady 200mg the first year, To it getting up To over a gram per day a couple of months ago. I have not cramped ever. I just dont want To do it anymore.  It isnt fun having To take a pill a couple of Times a day just To live life normally and having energy To work and function like a regular human beeing. 

This is a complete secret i keep from my family and friends including my wife.  With the exception of a few buddies that have almost the exact same journey as i do. 

I have quit a couple of Times before. Tried it all, CT , tapering, benzos. And the WD symptoms are just too much for me. Especially since i have To act normal while shivering and cold sweating and not beeing able To lay down still bc of the RLS(which i am diagnosed with even before the drugs). 

Ive only managed To be a couple of Days without it before turning back bc of the pain and suffering. 

I gave it another shot a week ago and tapered off from a steady 400mg to 100mg in the last couple of days. Its now been 3 days since the last dose. 

And This time ive gotten my hands on a couple of oxy 80s, ive taken minimal doses(5-15mg orally) two Times today, and it actually works! The euforia isnt there or the energy but i dont feel like dying, and i dont have those wierd brain flashes.

Now i know oxys are a much stronger drug, and i dont plan on taking these for recreational value, and have Maybe a weeks worth if i continue with this pace.

But am i really detoxing in this time ? Or am i just feeding the same need in a different way?  I wouldnt want To quit with the oxys in a couple of Days only To find out that i havent made any progress(Maybe i made it worse?) 

Can you detox from one opiate with the help of Another ? How much do you have To keep taking oxy To get physically dependent(in doses No more than 20mg, max 40mg in a day)? Wont my body crave opiates when i stop? ",1542674404.0

I have tried hydros and codeine w/acetaminophen on separate occasions, neither of which got me high at all (no opiate tolerance) and just made god awfully sick. Made my reasoning concrete as to why I avoid these things. (No more than 1000mg of ace at a time.)

Recently, I got ahold of some RP 5/325 percs. Took two yesterday, found somewhat of a high but still became very nauseous and sick. I still have 0 opiate tolerance. I do understand that RP's are regarded as bottom of the barrel pharmaceuticals. I have heard people say that only RP's 5/325's make them sick. 

What I wonder now is, is it the acetaminophen that is making me sick every time or am I just very prone to opiates? (even though the high was very subpar) 

I have thought about doing a CWE on these RP's, but I have held off on the chance that it is the opiate itself making me very nauseated. 

TL;DR: Everytime I have taken an opiate, it has contained tylenol and I cannot pinpoint whether it's the opiate or tylenol making me sick. 0 tolerance, 10mg of oxy and 650 mg of Acetaminophen, made me very sick. Wondering why it's making me sick. Thanks in advance. Sorry, I feel like this post is all over the place. ",1542660508.0

He goes and gets the stuff and he slams his. I dont even open my bag until later and when I do it's like brown powder?  Whatever, I've heard of crystal being brown from not being properly cooked and shit like that, im not used to not having shards. But whatever. I trusted my friend on that day. Did a decent sized line. No burn at all like meth usually has. My friend says it's just more like crank and not smokers ice. Weird but whatever. I'm being a dumbass addict at this point and need my fix so I dont give a fuck. So I continue on. Drive to Target down the road, and that's when it hits me. Everything felt so fucking warm and tingly. My vision was all fucked up. I had to stay in my car cause I was barely functioning. Then came the vomiting. Dry heaving for about 45 min then finally got it all out of me. Still feeling weird but am coming down. Zero speedy effects. All I wanna do is lay in bed. It felt somewhat reminiscent of when pure MDMA hits you, but not like that at all. Eventually I could compose myself to drive 10 min back to my house, but had to pull over and yak one more time.

I don't know if I'm allowed to post prices or the place, if I can because I'm not sourcing, just curious, let me know and I can give more details. I live in a big Midwest City and buy dime bags, usually wrapped up in foil but we get stamp bags here too.

My dealer answers from 9am-10pm every day, so I don't think she has a regular job. I never meet her personally, she has 1-2 runners she must pay that also work all day. She's the biggest dealer in this part of town, always has other people waiting near us. I'm assuming cause I've met like 4 other dealers on this strip, but their shit isn't as good, less flexible hours/take a while, and always meet themselves. I know a lot of people who go to her, and I've gone every day for about 2 years.

Any estimates? I'm really clueless when it comes to this. I don't know if they buy the dope prepackaged or if they make the bags themselves, or how much they buy it for. I'm really curious how cheap it is for them and how much they must make to not work.

Edit: thanks for all the replies! I just wanted to say I'm not specifically asking about my dealer, there's obviously no way anyone could know, just using as an example.

The last time I waited 36 hours before a 2mg sub dose and it absolutely wrecked me. I assume the stuff I am getting is has some fentalogues in it with it being as potent as it is.

I was wondering if there were any tips on how to make them last longer, or if there are OTC meds that will lessen the withdrawals. I am prescribed clonazepam for withdrawals and have some Librium (not much) after a very long stay in the hospital where I was hooked up to a fentanyl pump.

The victim mentality seems most common amongst junkies(over other drug addicts). The blaming of everyone else, constant lying and whining gets tiring and makes it hard for people to have sympathy for you. Junkies need to not only start taking responsibility for their actions but to also mature and be less dramatic about everything.

9ye4fa,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ye4fa/so_you_want_a_script_guide_to_going_to_pain/,51,https://redd.it/9ye4fa,cozywarmedblanket,So you want a script? Guide to going to Pain Management and not acting like a junky,"First off, the days of getting big scripts for a fake back ache are gone.  Only proceed if you have an actual injury or pain.

An interesting fact is that most adults have some form of fluid sac degradation in their spine, so you may have damage that would show up on an MRI and not even know it.

1. **Dress nicely** \- not fake nicely, but like you dress like that every day.  Take a shower, shave, and wear clean pants/shorts and a button down/polo/solid color shirt.  Don't wear graphic tees or anything like that.  If you have trac marks, be sure to wear long sleeve.  Also cover up any tattoos you can.  Dont wear those double layered shirts I see people cover their arms with for court.  You know the ones - white on bottom and a tshirt over.
2. **Don't go in looking for a script** \- even if thats your goal.  Go in explaining that you have this pain and its been affecting your life/sleep/work.  Tell them you've tried to do the things you used to but cant anymore and **just want answers.**
3. **Accept that it'll take 3 or more appts before a script could even come up** \- the first appt will be all talk, then an MRI/imaging, and then an after discussion.
4. **Try everything they throw at you** \- If you want to try and short circuit some of the options you can say you've been trying physical therapy on youtube or whatever, but if they want you to go to PT, go.  When the doctor talks to you about trying a shot or whatnot, **listen and act hopeful that it'll help.**
5. **Pay with insurance, if you can** \- cash is always a bad sign.  If you dont have insurance, pay with a credit card.
6. **Wait at least a few months before trying to up your script, if not longer** \- you can get away with having a ""bad reaction"" maybe once, but if its your first script its a bad sign.  Also you only get so many changes before they cut you off.  One nice thing is most insurances wont pay for oxy ER anymore, so the PM will usually work with you on a med that your insurance covers - this is when you can use the ""morphine gets me feeling tingly and weird(histamine)"" and get opana or something else as its covered.  **Don't push your luck!**
7. **DONT go to the ER** \- people who are really in pain dont go to the ER all the time.  If you're in lots of pain and the clinic is closed, leave a voicemail or call the next day.  Also, it should go without saying, but **dont be stupid and try to get an injury to get a small script, it will not work.**
8. **Always go to the same pharmacy** \- accept that the first time going they will contact your doctor multiple times.  They may even want the chart.  Be patient and persistent.
9. **If a pharmacy says they are out of stock, ask for them to order it:** pharmacies bank  on the fact that people wont ask that.  Try to find a pharmacy that is a chain but not super busy.  Build a rapport with a pharmacist just like you are with your pain doctor. 
10. **Don't ask for early refills, ever.**  Also don't be the guy filling the script at 12:01AM or when they open.  Pick it up around lunch or so.
11. And, last but not least, be ready for drug testing - some places do it less than others, but have a plan for this always ready to go.  Ive never had a place actually do a pill count, but so ready over your pain contract and be ready for that too.

Hope this helps with the many questions I see all the time about getting meds at pain management.  If I forgot anything, let me know!

Bonus: here are some reasons why certain medications might cause you problems that warrant a change:

**Tramadol** has an SSRI effect which can cause depression, brain zaps, and other bad side effects.

**Morphine** is known for bad histamine reactions - pins and needles, itching, etc

**Some ER formulations** are known to cause upset stomach

When in doubt, google the drug and read all the known side effects and see which were most common.",1542607957.0

I am looking for something long acting that won't put me in total nod territory but will feel nice. Tram does that but I would like to alternate with either Oxy or Methadone. The lack of cross tolerance with Tram is a nice benefit.

The Toroxycon OX40mg pills. I will get 5 40mg pills. I am currently using about .2-.3 of fire heroin. The purity of my H is between 60-70%. This is tested. So my question is what is the best way to taper down with 5 pills. J thought about since these are ER pills I will take on the first day 40mg on the second and third 20mg. Then on the 4th day 10mg and on the 5th 5mg. And then I will see if I can do it on the 6th without any pill. I also get 10x2.5mg Lorazepam which I will take like needed. I will maybe just try it with the Lorazepam first and wait till I pass my drug test. Its ok if I will be positive for benzos since I got a script for them. and since 10x2.5mg Lorazepam are like 25x10mg Diazepam I can do it with them too. And then I can enjoy some oxy which I have just done once. Since oxy isnt very common in my country. Maybe someone got some input for me. I tried staying off for 24 hours. And I did it. Stayed sober for more than 24 hours but then I just couldnt stand the diarrhea and chills. So if needed I can do it cold turkey too but it will be hard and I have to go to work too so I wont risk that.

By the way please don’t try to tell me to not take it as it will lead me down a dark path since

2. I would never steal an opiate from a family member since it’s there medication and they may need it 

3. And I am not at all a fiend for drugs as in my closet I have a stash with xans, addys, vyvanse, 4-Fa, and pretty much unlimited wax cartridges and I only let myself get high once a week on Saturday night with my friends.

Oh and finally don’t tell me to sell because I don’t have an addictive personality but I know many who do and could get hooked off of one high and I’m not tryna ruin someone’s life for the however much one of these pills sells for.

While I was there, my normal physician (who prescribed all the good stuff) moved out of state. So in the time I’ve been back, I’ve kind of been tossed around to different doctors in the practice with no one knowing quite what to do with me as they are all terrified of killing me with an OD or having the DEA on them. So it’s been a bit of a stressful ordeal trying to keep my medications straight with them. 

Anyway, today (yes on a Sunday.. weird), I got a message from one of the doctors that I’ve seen there recently with the subject: “We need to talk... OPIOIDS”
Ahhh! I’m freaking out. I truthfully can’t even get enough courage to actually open the message (I figure since it’s Sunday there isn’t shit I can do about anything he would potentially say until the office opens tomorrow anyway). I am so scared though. 

This is kind of a shit post so I apologize, but you guys are the only people that would understand. Not only am I going to be in a world of withdrawal hurt if they take my opioids away (which I am pretty sure that’s what this message is going to say...I’ve got the feeling since seeing docs I don’t know well that they all want to say that but no one quite has the guts...), but I have actual legitimate conditions that are ridiculously painful, and a tolerance that is - thanks to being over prescribed from a time when I didn’t know any better - that of a small rhinoceros 🦏. 

I am not even an “addict” if you go by the definition of doing it because if cravings and despite it having a negative effect on ones life. I don’t have the mental cravings (been thru withdrawal a number of times due to pharmacy screw ups over the years and... withdrawal itself is honestly the least of my worries... it’s the actual pain I experience when I don’t have decent doses... if I don’t have pain I don’t take meds and it’s not a big psychological deal). 

However, I am terrified. I don’t know what I’m going to do if they take my meds away. I will be completely nonfunctional, not able to get out of bed, and lose everything that I’ve accomplished BECAUSE of opioids (well because of the pain relief from them). It’s exactly the opposite of most people’s issues but nonetheless it’s the same result. 

It’s dumb but I don’t know how I’m gonna find the courage just to read the damn message and am here stressing myself out not even knowing what’s going on. Ugh.

How? Unless, of course, I am no longer absorbing the bupe? I've used multiple ROA's in my search for relief and nothing helped. Nothing made it better.  Now, how in the hell do I explain this to my Dr? Hey Doc... uhh... I don't think I'm able to properly metabolize bupe anymore ? ",1542567459.0

Started with t3s, then to perks, then dillies and morphines, and finally moving to hydrocodone as its the one I like best. I can honestly attribute it to a lot of the successes i've had the past 5 years. Being able to take an edge off in a fast paced, critical thinking, extreme stress environment has proven to be extremely beneficial for myself.   


 I'l use sometimes a max of 60mg in a single work day ( sometimes 80-100mg when partying on weekends ), and then say the next day after a big mg day/night use only 40mg max. My doses are very, very sporadic and generally it's not because I NEED to take one ( can't get the thought of an oxy out of my head ), it's more or less because i'm bored or may have a stressful situation that needs enduring where taking an edge off has proven to have an advantage. I understand that when I run out of the pills I like, that other forms of harder opiates are completely off limits. Period. Never once have I thought about buying heroin, or fentanyl, or ANY other substance or pill where I don't know where it came from. If I can't find a true script of oxy's or dillies, where I can actually see the seller's script info on a bottle ( i've had the same scripts for years anyways ) I just refrain from using opiates period. Buying heroin, or harder opiates does not appeal to me in the least bit. I almost pass out when I get blood drawn, or see a needle. Very sorry to some, but heroin actually fucking disgusts me.   


 The longest and highest mg dose I have used opiates was 8 months straight, at 40mg-60mg a day with the odd 20mg only tossed in and higher doses on weekends. I know for some that's peanuts. I decided to cut cold turkey when non where readily available, and tried to keep my body and mind busy, and only craved them mentally for maybe 3 days after my final dose. The physical symptoms where normal, fair amount of cold/hot sweats especially at night time, random mood swings, and a deep sense of anxiety. It's weird, when I feel all of these symptoms I can fight through them, and I can keep reassuring myself it's just the drug and not me. That's what keeps me going. I know it will pass, and for all the situations it's helped me out in the past years, it has to come with a hand of bad. I have stopped cold turkey dozens of times over the years, and each time it almost gets a bit easier.   


Is this normal? Are their others like me? Thank you. ",1542566998.0

I was told by my doctor and some answers on the internet that bupe or subs will not test positive on a 6 panel test (oxy, amphetamine, cocaine, thc, pcp, and benzos) and that the test would need to look for specifically bupe. I was researching on the internet when i ran across this

""YES! Suboxone is comprised of two different drugs, buprenorphine and naloxone. Oxycodone tests look for a metabolite called Noroxymorphone. The problem is, one of the metabolites of Naloxone is Noroxymorphone as well. This is a little studied fact that users of Suboxone CAN show positive for Oxycodone as well. It appears that Noroxymorphone can be detected in the body after taking Naloxone for between 2-5 hours after absorption. Suboxone is taken sublingually, under the tongue, and Naloxone is poorly absorbed sublingually. The problem is that many Suboxone users are swallowing the mouth full of liquid (Suboxone, saliva) after the buprenorphine is absorbed. Since the Naloxone is not well absorbed under the tongue, it is absorbed after swallowing!! A friend of mine just tested positive for the Oxycodone metabolite Noroxymorphone and he has been taking only Suboxone. A solution to this problem may be to raise the cutoff level for Noroxymorphone in Oxycodone tests.""

Is this true? The only opiate on the test is oxy.",1542563554.0

so i drove about 45 minutes to meet up with my coworker friend, who has been addicted to H for some time and also sells it.

even though we’re mostly work friends, we’ve hung out a few times outside of work and get along really well. so she generally cares about my safety and well being & wanted to show me how to properly smoke it and how much to do. 

i told her at first that i’d just watch her do it because i didn’t want to drive 45 minutes home, high on heroin for the first time. but she insisted that i try it right now and that i won’t get fucked up with a hit or two. so i took two hits of it off the foil and all was good. i really didn’t feel anything right away, but then she wanted a ride to get 10 dollar bills from a gas station. 5 mins after, i just felt the opiate euphoria just wash over me. it felt really nice but i wasn’t super high. i could still drive confidently for 45 minutes. 

when i got to my house, i was really excited to get even higher. so i smoked a little chunk (about the same size that her and i sorta shared) and felt decently higher. about five minutes after that i decided i really wanted to go the full length, so i smoked the other little piece that was even a bit smaller than original one. i also crushed up the tiny crumbs on the bottom into a nice little bump and railed that. 

after all of that, i was really high. my whole body was half numb and i almost felt weightless. i was trying to do stuff on my phone but i was nodding off so hard i couldn’t even keep my eyes open. after battling the nod for about 30 mins, i tried to fall asleep. 

and that’s where shit went bad. 

i thought that heroin, or just opiates in general, would make/help you fall asleep, but i could not fall asleep for the life of me. i just tossed and turned in my hazy high. for hours. somewhere in that time i had lost my high, and around 7am i started to get a headache. that’s when i decided i had enough and just took a ton of hits from my wax pen and drank a bit of water and passed out for about two hours. 

i woke up with a TERRIBLE migraine, i felt like i had no energy. i eventually got up from my pain to go to the bathroom, but getting up and moving made me start to get clammy and sweaty, and my stomach started to get really upset. i was feeling so hot and like i was going to vomit, i just went outside quick and bent over for five minutes. only dry heaving once. 

i then went to my bed and laid in agony. basically the same symptoms for hours until i managed to pass out from enough THC entering my body. the hour nap helped a bit and the symptoms slowly wore off. except for the pounding headache which i eventually solved with some ibuprofen. 

where did i go wrong?? is this just a normal heroin hangover? was my body already having withdrawal symptoms from one use? did i just take too much or was the usage too spanned out in time? what will help me feel better if i find myself in the same situation? 

i am a complete heroin noob, please help me. i need information from experienced users. like a beginners guide. ",1542524588.0

&#x200B;

Let me try my best to make a educated guess, I'll bring up a few things below.

We know from studies that of those RXed opiates maybe 1-2% will go on to develop addiction, we also know from a study done in Europe that when offered INFINITE FREE HEROIN addicts would initially consume much more but almost all eventually settled to around 2 grams per day in the long run.

&#x200B;

I do think casual opiate use for aches and pains would skyrocket, you know people popping some codeine or oxycodone for backaches or menstrual cramps etc. Many people right now take a horrifying amount of APAP or NSAIDS just to get through the day, I think they'd actually be better off on low dose opiates.

&#x200B;

I assume the lower levels of society would see a lot of opiate addiction, but it already does so its a wash pretty much.

&#x200B;

I think hard core addiction might actually decrease slightly. Legal or not society would still frown on IVing daily. I think there are people who for whatever reason will still be reckless and OD etc. Alcohol is legal and there are still people knowingly drinking til their liver screams and shrivels into a ball. I think the greatest threat to a return to prohibition is people wanting to ""do something"" to save this reckless population.

I almost died today.
My heart stopped and I was legally dead for 4 minutes. 
There was no warmth or flashes of a life well lived. 

I almost died today. 
So many things undone, so much left to do. 
I don't even remember my last breath.

I overdosed today.
All in the pursuit of an escape from reality; I nearly escaped for good.

I overdosed today.
What I thought was powdered Oxycontin turned out to be Carfentynal.

I overdosed today.
I thought nothing could put me over the edge. 
My own stupidity and need for an escape mercilessly rifled my body off a 100 foot cliff to be impaled on the jagged rocks below.

I killed myself today 
There was no God or relief.

I KILLED MYSELF TODAY.
I have squandered the one good thing I have left. 

I KILLED MYSELF TODAY.
I fear that it's too hard to stop; I am petrified thaf it's too late.

I SURVIVED.
But I'll probably kill myself tomorrow.",1542519195.0

I was cleaning out my closet, I just recently found I am very motivated on opana lol. So anyways, it’s not a huge mess but some crap I wanted to bring to the shed like my BB guns and paintball guns, stuff I just don’t need In a bedroom closet.

Found an old safe, I mean old, like at least 8 years old, it’s small, I got it from a yard sale and used to put my goods in there back when I was using regularly. 
Open it up and see a pill bottle, dump them out and orange hexagon pills come out. I knew exactly what they were, the old sublingual subs from a long ass time ago. Since it’s not in the original bottle, there is no what to tell the exact expiration date. I’d say at least 4 years or so? I got them fresh from someone who used to sell his script. I bought them on days he got his fill and that was like 6 or 7 years ago...I can’t think of the exact time frame but shortly after my last purchase he started getting the films. 
I estimate them to be 3-4 years expired bc if they were fresh say 7 years ago, meds usually are good for 3-4 years so yeah. I could be absolutely wrong. 
Anyways it was a nice surprise for sure but don’t know if I should keep them around to test out on a rainy day. I had a buddy who would get high off them. I’m not a daily user anymore but maybe a rainy boring day that I’m broke I can test them. Idk, I’ve got 37 of them just chillin in a bottle. I put them back in the safe and put up. 
Anyone know how much it affects the quality or even if it does? I’ve taken T3’s that we’re 20 years old from my parents house from my dads root canal back in 1995 and still felt like it was T3 and imo the potency was the same, if anything it may have went down a tiny tiny bit.

Full: About 3 years ago I started to get into using opiates (small amount like 5-10mgs of oxy once a week or so). About 2 year ago I started to do them daily in high doses, 3 10mg IR Opanas 4 10mg oxys, 2-3 10mg methadone, and an 8mg dilauded when I could get my hands on any of it and Ioved it. It always me made me feel invincible, but within this last year of 2017 I really slowed down and stopped about 6 months ago, except for the occasional 10-20mg oxy once in a blue moon. I'm in a bit of a delimma now, I rarely use anymore but I've been dealing with depression and anxiety my whole life. I've tried almost every medicine on the market for those illnesses but nothing seems to click. However when I take small amounts of opiates, say a 10mg hydro or a 5mg oxy, I always feel like I have a drive to get things accomplished. I've lost the interest in getting completely fucked up off these things, but I feel like they do have a therapeutic value to them in smaller doses. Does anyone else do this or feel this way?

I had read online somewhere of someone taking 3 75mg doses of methadone to get off H with no withdrawal. I was skeptical but out of options. I need to work but can't if I'm withdrawing. So I bought 150mg of methadone and used the last of my heroin.


Day one : I woke up in withdrawal only having used a small amount last night and had just enough left over to get me well enough to get into work. At about 1am I consumed my first 50mg dose of methadone and an hour later I was feeling pretty good. Like the feeling after you were high but not yet in withdrawal. Content. 


Day two: woke up in withdrawal? Felt sluggish had rsl and a runny nose. Oh no this isn't gonna work fuck. Trudged to work and consumed another 50mg methadone at 9am. Again felt great. 


Day three : woke up very tierd but atleast no withdrawal symptoms. Got into work and decided to take 30mg and leave 20 just incase. Again felt great. 


Day 4:woke up no withdrawl Again very tierd though. Decided not to take methadone felt pretty good throughout the day just more tierd than usual. 


Day 5 : tierd Again but no withdrawl feel pretty good through the day. 

That's where I'm at. Late in the day day 5 feeling great. Just like myself. Not sure if I still have methadone in my system or if I'm clear. It was almost too easy. 

I have 20mg left i may just use it tonight for the fun of it. But don't want to risk getting Methadone withdrawl. 


So yeah I guess I will wait and see how tommorow goes but I think I just got off a gram a day heroin habbit with no withdrawal at all really.

Never shot up. Most I’ve done at once is ~ 240mg - 300mg of some oxy. I’ve cut down recently (due to not having money for it) so I use sparsely through the week. 

The reason I’m making this post is just to vent a little and to share. I live with my gf who I love dearly. She’s not an addict or anything but she loves me too. She knows what I do for the most part. I feel like I played her yesterday.

I was upset because I didn’t have any weed or pills. The fucked up part is I guilt her until I get what I want. I’ll dis her and disrespect her and even go as far as to act like I’m packing up and leaving for the night. I’ve done it many times. I know I play on her insecurities by doing that too.

If I ever try to get clean I replace opiates with a heap of regular cardio to help with my chronic pain and get those endorphins flowing. 

I have a month of annual leave coming up and was originally planning on trying to get clean again but I kinda know I'm not ready and feel like I've failed before I even started, plus I've been sooo depressed all week just thinking about stopping using in a week. So I'm kinda thinking there's no real point in wasting my precious leave and going through all that pain of tapering etc. If I'm just going to get back to work and start using again. 


But I digress, have many people here been successful in maintaining a regular exercise routine while still using daily? I think if I can aim to have some balance on my leave and still go and swim 1km a day then get high I would at least feel like I've accomplished something worthwhile while still getting high and having fun. I know if I just nod out for 3 weeks straight I'm gonna feel like shit about it when the time is up. Do people think this is doable? I've always struggled to maintain any balance in my life so if people have some successful exercise/using schedules/stories to help motivate me that would be great.

Have been trying to cop for the past 48 hours...Thursday night went to all shit because of this non-Fucking snow storm that blanketed the north east with like 3 inches of snow during rush hour, which basically rendered the northern part of my state useless for 8 hours (my girl was stuck at work for an extra 4 hours after working a 12 hour shift and it still took her 3.5 hours to get home where it normally takes 45 minutes).  By the time she got home my dboy, who swore he’d stay away for me (and normally does) passed the fuck out.

Got a message this morning (Friday) saying my bad, I got you whatever time you can come through today.  So 6pm rolls around and he says yea he’s good but I gotta meet him in the hood, which I absolutely hate as there’s no good reason for a white boy to be in the hood...but I was mentally committed.  So I embarked on the 55 minute drive, mind you he was also on his way there and I was literally 5 minutes behind him.  When he got there he calls me and says how long and I told him just stay in your car I’m LITERALLY TWO MINUTES from you.  When I get there I call him and he goes “there’s some shady shit going on I’ll hit you back in a minute” (FAMOUS DBOY WORDS FOR WHO THE FUCK KNOWS IF ILL HIT YOU BACK BEFORE THE NEXT BIG BANG).  So, I find his car and park in front of him and...surprise surprise...he doesn’t answer.  I’m already incredibly uncomfortable chillin in the hood so after 30 minutes I bounce.  Complete waste of 2 hours, tolls, and gas.

After I’m home for an hour he hits me back saying my bad I’ll be back home, meet me there.  So I drive BACK up to him, another 40 minutes.  Tells me to meet him at Walmart (which is normal)...so I go inside and grab some McDonald’s and he texts me 1 minute...I finish up and go outside and POOF.  No answer and now his phone is going to VM.  Mind you he’s been my main guy for years and typically is on point (for a dboy).  I wait another 30 mins and then drive back home, frustrated as all hell...tail between my legs.

At least I have some temazepam and a couple good beers to take the edge off...but fuck this life, this is exactly why I so desperately am trying to get out of it for good.

TL;DR - Drove 2 hours round trip, sat in the hood for 30 minutes for no reason.  Drive another 1.5 hours and sat at a Walmart for 30 minutes for no reason.  Dboys suck.

Hope you all habe better luck on this wonderful Friday and have a great weekend.",1542436652.0

Besides the loperamide I've also got promethazine, gabapentin, hydroxyzine, etizolam, xanax, zofran, seroquel, Diphenhydramine, and pretty much every OTC painkiller and cough medicine.

Hi, i'm Addie, and i'm an addict.
I've been clean for about 7 years now. 
I have noticed in my self, an extra sensitivity to feelings, like, physical feelings, certain textures in my hands. I have other mild mental disorders, so I had initially put these down as that.  Until I met two other addicts in recovery. One for four years and one at 7 with me. They both talk about the same feelings.. it's as simple as sticking your hand in a bin of flour and losing yourself in dopamine soaked brain waves.. 
I always thought it was just me, until the other 7 year was telling me about how he always felt his senses were heightened during the come down. He loved to be touched when dope sick. Whereas me (f) HATED to be touched (for the first/only time ever) when I was sick..
Your skin on mine would feel like a flame or 1000 daggers piercing my flesh till I just wanted to scream in agony..
To each his own, but back to the point..
Do recovered addicts have higher sensations than regular people? Do our brains so need to release that feeling of pleasure that we can release on contact with minuscule things? If anyone else feels this way, feel free to let me know. Non judgy obvs. I've done alot of googling and nothing to the science behind the feeling.

I had tons of money and was fucked up 24/7. I didn't really need the money or care too much. I was chilling, smoking playing video games or something and if someone wanted bud or coke or whatever. I didn't really want to risk going anywhere and I knew you would come to me as for the excuses they are for you to not get upset or wait longer. (It really doesn't make too much sense but it does at the time). We not want to go or drive or we are running late due to chilling and getting fucked up. Most people would get pissed off if we said we will be there in 3 hours. We might lose a sale. We would rather lie to keep the business. This shouldn't always be the case but sometimes it is.

I work through the night and I have my own office and let me tell you, I sure as fuck get bored at times.

Mostly I'm a maintenance user - meaning that I use the same amount every day in every shot just to keep myself well enough to look people in the eyes and not be drooling all over myself. Rarely do I use to get high these days because to be honest, my tolerance won't even let me catch a good high anymore.

About 78% of the posts I've read contain mostly disclaimers and don't have actual info that pertain to the questions in them. And for a good reason, H is a fucking trap. I understand. 


So, I'm really looking for info on how to do this safely. I've read all the variations of disclaimers that there are. I'm sorry if this comes across as arrogant, not trying to be. I've just found it a little frustrating to find real in-depth info that I can use to try and avoid harming myself. Obligatory ""don't do heroin if you wanna avoid harming yourself"" (but again that's a valid argument).


I can't get pills where I live, at all, so I'm tryin' H. Never done Opiates. 

* Is smoking or monkey water a better way to dip my toes in at first? I have some fentanyl test strips, so I will at least be knowing to some extent if what I'm about to ingest is Fentanyl or not. 


* Can anyone tell me what sort of experience I might expect from Tar my first time around? I'm thinking of just ripping off a tiny teeny little tear the size of maybe Abe Lincoln's nose on a penny. And either smoking that or using it with monkey water. 


* With smoking or monkey water, how can I tell if I'm in a danger zone with how my body is reacting? Like, will I realize that I'm close to ODing? I don't have any friends.. so, it's not really an option for me to do it with someone. 


* Is being Opiate Naive, different than not being opiate naive but having no tolerance?


Curious if anyone has been in the same position as me, uhm, and I'm really just trying to not die my first go around with opiates. Considering it's the 2nd most potent one.

I've been scammed and had to argue with people who brought a good sample but then tried selling me shit when I bought big.. So..

I was once staying at my ex place for a month and her neighbor was selling dope, so naturally I mixed it up with him, I got in good with him and I got his number. I live in Europe and we have a lot of #3 and people normally smoke it, but I prefer to snort and this guy had #4 so it was a fucking jackpot.

Anyways time flies, I break up with the skank, dude moves out, changes his number and I lose all contact. Then I get a call from someone, explaining that he is now the owner of my plug's phone and is working instead of the plug I met. He gave me a free sample but it was some garbage dope and I maybe called him once or twice.

After a while his number goes offline and I get another call from him asking to meet up and he offers me another half a gram as a free sample. Dope he gave me was even worse than before and I forgot to save his number so I was doomed to buying from middle men.

About a week ago I start wishing that my phone would ring and the voice on the other side would go; ""Hey it's me, new number, got time? I got something for you.."" You could call this The Secret ™  or the law of attraction but I got the call today.

""Hey it's me. \*\*PLUG\*\*'s girl, you remember me right? I got the phone and I salvaged your number, give me a call if you want to meet up.""

Oh my god!! JJ is real! This was the girl from the plug that I originally met, before he sold the phone and those dudes started selling weak junk.. I told her to meet me right away & she even delivered to my place which is out in the suburbs. I was skeptic because of the shit dope that I got before so I only bought a gram.. Shieet I should've bought 5. It's that fire #4! I can snort it without any preparations or clogging in my nose, it isn't cut with shit, she delivers anywhere and said she would even front because she remembers how stand up I was when dealing with her man.

I'm so fucking happy.And to anyone that read this far, the plug I originally met is currently locked up. His girl is holding shit down tho.

During a weekend trip last month with my longterm girlfriend/love of my life I Od’d. The thing is she didn’t know I was hooked no one in my entire life barring my mom knew. I was real good at hiding it because I have a good job and pay bills and have no debt. So when I went to bed and turned blue and woke up to EMTs and my girlfriend apologizing for calling the cops the only thing I could think was “wow great fuck up”. I had  ruined everything. My girlfriend who all I want to do is protect can’t stop telling me (not passive aggressively but just through random conversation) how she has nightmares about seeing me again having dead eyes and gasping looking lifeless. I traumatized the only thing I really love and she will never ever look at me the same again. 

This is a woman who doesnt touch weed or alcohol and to be told by the hospital I was on heroin was definitely the first time I saw real disappointment in her eyes. I cannot for the life of me pull myself out of this funk knowing how much hurt I caused. Whenever I zone out or daydream all I feel is like I’m being narcaned and throwing up her screaming. God I am a fucking idiot. I hate how much of a shitbag I am. 

She stayed next to me when I was recovering in the hospital because I wasnt taking in enough oxygen and was still in shock. She told me stories of when she was a child. She told me if she ever found out I was back on it she would have to rethink “us”. So instead of sticking to weed like I told her here I am on the couch nose full of boy. I cannot find a reason why I am this way like any other person here. 

I do not deserve her. But she won’t leave me even though I try to let her go. Why can’t I just realize what a blessing I have in a woman who sees me dead and still wants to get married and start a family. But no I am watching youtube blasted on the couch.

I think it’s about time I get a small amount of Oxy again (I haven’t had any in months) and this time, I was looking at getting some OxyContin ER rather than IR.

I currently have a small tolerance to Tramadol, but that should quickly dissipate as I stop taking them now. Back when I last had oxy, I would take 10-20mg of IR stuff which would have me feeling real good and occasionally nodding. I generally have a pretty low tolerance to most things. 

So, rather than getting IR this time, I am considering getting some OxyContin 40mg ER since they’re much cheaper and with my low tolerance, I figure 40mg of ER would have me feeling real good for the whole night; saving me from re-dosing etc.

Would 40mg of OxyContin be good for someone who would normally feel real good on (closer to 10) 10-20mg of IR? Thanks guys and stay safe.",1542362156.0

I went cold turkey and it has been and still is a rough ride. i'm starting to reap the benefits of it though. My quality of life is improving. My self esteem and motivation are both coming back. Finally i'm working on becoming stable, mentally and situationally. Happiness is still elusive but i know i will find more of it with time with this path and i want to stay on it for once.

But man oh man am i still an addict. Going without a cigarette for a while is rough. Going without weed is pretty bad too. Im always drowning out the noise in any way i can and i need to work on it, before it gets me in trouble again.

I took adderall last night & today (got some sleep somehow) and i loved it last night but at work today i just wanted a cigarette the whole damn shift. I still worked hard and did my job right but i was so fuckin awkward & i hated almost every minute of being there despite breezing through the work. Which i'm always awkward and good at my job but my pupils could have been noticable & i was acting a little out of the ordinary. Fingers crossed i didnt fuck up my promotion lmaooooo

I did it a lot in high school but never felt like i needed it. Part of me thinks i can do it recreationally still, but the better part of me knows it's a rocky road because i thought i could do opiates recreationally and uhhhhhh NOPE. Im just trying to fill a void or something. It's only gonna lead to more trouble. 

But guess what? Prolly gonna keep doing it cuz it's available and it helps me get through life a little easier (outside of work) and i know i shouldnt but this desire to get some sort of rush & escape is ingrained into me. I don't think i can beat it head on. i need to weaken it by finding the deeper problems. But alas. Life is a struggle. I recognize that i might cause another crisis and now i must try to do something differently than what ive done in the past.

Cops don't give 2 fucks about good Samaritan laws assuming your state even has any, there is a thread right now in /r/legaladvice where in a state with GS laws the cops seized all the possessions and all forms of ID and all cash from everyone present.

Couldn't catch an Oxy high for shit after that. I think the Bupe raised my tolerance or something cause in the past I would stop and go back and be fine getting high but this was the only time I took subs daily for like an entire week. So I spent over a week taking oxies and not getting high.   


So why burn my money on pills that aren't working. I went back to the subs. It's weird though cause I've discovered subs work as a good substitute for my old addiction. Like even though I don't get high I get excited in the morning when I wake up just knowing i got that morning dose coming. Then I get excited in the afternoon or evening when I can take my second dose.   


I usually crush my morning dose into a powder and snort it. 2mg of Bupe just somehow gets me kinda amped up and it just works like a substitute for dope or oxy.  I know many people end up addicted to Suboxone for years but hell if it keeps me clean and I can go about my life normally in all other ways then why the hell not.

There is no heroin where I live, so whenever I purchased it, that would have to happen in one of the larger cities in my country and because I have to bring it back with me from my travels the smallest amount I have ever copped in North America is 3.5grams. 

How much is a bun?

This is my first time attempting to IV oxycodone. I’m not unfamiliar with needles as I’ve run multiple AAS cycles, so needles do not bother me. But I do have a few questions for you great people. 1) All I have on hand are 29g needles  with 3cc syringes. Would this tear my veins to shit or would I be ok with occasionally using these til I get more? 2) If I’m planning to IV roughly 15mg at a time, does the amount of water used have any effect? 3) I’m assuming I do not need to cook oxy once it has been dissolved in water, correct? Would I still need a cotton in this situation? 4) What dosage should I start with? My tolerance is pretty high, ~300mg+ a day of Oxy, with 300mg being a low day. 
Thank you to everyone that replies and gives advice. I really appreciate it. 
A little backstory on my habit and tolerance: I’ve used opiates for 10+ years. The first 3 yrs being Oxy, the next 5 yrs was heroin, and the last 2 yrs have been strictly Oxy with less than a handful of times where I’ve used H. 
No need for harm reduction. I’ve been to hell and back with this habit and I’m well aware of the risks. 
Thanks again to all those who reply

The last time I used was 2 weeks prior to getting the Vivitrol, and after that I gave my dad all my savings to hold on to (so that I wouldn't blow the money on dope). On the morning of my appointment for the Vivitrol shot, they tested my urine and then gave me a shot of Narcan as a ""test"" to make sure I didn't have any opiates in my system. The Narcan immediately made me feel kind of like a (very mild) version of opiate withdrawal. It wasn't unbearable, but I was definitely having cold sweats, loss of appetite, restless leg, needing to use the bathroom, etc. The doctor told me if I we t ahead with the Vivitrol shot, I would keep feeling like that for at least 2 days and then it would probably go away but he ""couldn't guarantee anything.""

I tried to tell my dad I didn't want the shot and I didn't want to feel like shit for (possibly) a whole month, but he said if I didn't get the shot, he was throwing me lut on the street and keeping all my money (that I had given him to hold) so that I wouldn't be able to get a place to stay.

I have been doing some research, and it turns out Vivitrol blocks your brain's natural pleasure chemicals in addition to blocking opiatese, resulting in an inability to feel pleasure.

I have had some people tell me that Vivitrol starts to wear off as soon as 2 1/2 to 3 weeks, but I also read a post here on r/opiates by a guy who said he tried to use opiates 31 days after taking Vivitrol and didn't feel a thing (meaning the Vivitrol hadn't even begun to wear off).

I'm definitely not going back in a month for my next shot, and I hope this one wears off ASAP.

Anyone else have any experience with Vivitrol? Do you start to feel better after a while? How long does it really take to start wearing off?",1542333318.0

They also did a urine test. Anyway fast forward the dr calls and says they did a urine drug screen on him. First question who most likely ordered this? His doctor who sent him there for tests or the er dr. The pcp originally just said blood and ct. Well he wasnt informed of a screen it showed positive for weed benzo and methamphetamine. He can account for the benzo and weed. Yet it didnt show opiate which he had taken 2 days prior and that was prescribed to him from said dr. He had gotten valium from the VA a few months ago and took the leftovers during a stressful time recently. Well the methamphetamine is where we are confused. What can cause that? He did get adderal from a friend at school so he could do a bunch of work over the week I had no clue till I heard the dr say it. I've looked and it says that shows as amphetamines not meth the dr even asked if he had bought any street meth illegally. I'm so stressed because we see the same dr and I get a monthly script of valium and do not give him mine so unless he stole some it was not from me. Will the dr want to drug test me? Cut me off? I mean all that will show is valium for me. But I'm worried he will think I gave him some. He can print off showing he got them from the VA. I'm so stressed. ,1542332252.0

I deal with the black tar because its all we have, but I won't shoot it only smoke it.  So any chance I have I go home and stock up. ...GETTING TO THE POINT so anyway of course everyone is like use the DNM's you can get the world best ecp direct! Sounded to good to be true, but I tried it. Now don't get me wrong I am not by any means knocking the DNMs, this is strictly concerning ecp. I tried numerous vendors mostly with high rating but some more low down ones to get a full spectrum. All the product was different looking but it all gave the same effect and certainly did not have really many similar qualities to what I have known and loved to call ecp or at less what I am used to (stamped bag quality). All the stuff from the DNM seemed to be maybe some kind of home lab made#5 or maybe a research chemical, I am really not sure but they were smokable substances and that is certainly not what I am used to with ecp. The rush was also really strange on all of them... it gives you that pins and needle rush like tar but then you don't feel high sedated like you just feel disoreiented. All and all I was pretty bummed and now I have a drawer full of unused ""substances"" that cost me a boat load and well they just don't quite do it for me. ANYWAY my question is does anyone know about this or what substances this vendors are selling, because clearly they all got the same memo which read"" Hey I know this stuff that we could pass off as ecp, its cheap and will still get them feeling some kind of way""   Im just curious if anyone else has been experiencing this     AND TO ANYONE ORDERING ECP FROM THE DNM beware

I've been at my methadone clinic for years and have been clean off everything else for a very long time now, so when kits became available I was never even asked if I wanted one by the nurses or doctors, but I assume it was cuz of the fact I don't use and haven't in a long time.

  


But this past week I've been given 2 one at my clinic and one at a pharmacy that I used to get methadone from so they had that on my record and they asked me if I wanted a kit so I said sure to both kits. I live in Canada where they are always free, but I live on a street where there is a temp homeless shelter at the end of it and I always drive by and see cops and ambulances there a lot and ppl always hanging out outside and I've seen a few ppl OD as I saw paramedics issue narcan the nasal spray. So I thought it would be smart to have a kit or 2 on me when I go out just in case. I don't know anyone personally that uses anymore so it really would just be used on the off chance I'm driving by and someone is passed out and I have no problem going to check it out if it means I can help faster then paramedics. But it's getting colder where I am and snowing a lot more and temperatures below freezing and I originally thought I'll just put the kits in my car, but would the solution in the nasal spray freeze and be useless that way?

  


I have children and one is very young and into everything so having it out in the open so I can remember to take it with me everytime I go out isn't really an option for me as I would have to put it somewhere way out of reach which will definitely make me forget about it all the time.

Luckily I'll be cutting them into halves and fourths so I won't need to get more than '7 days worth' each month until we can petition the insurance and get them to either approve the Butrans patch or whatever.

How do you deal with Heroin/Opiate Addicts?,"Everyone loves to hate on the Piggies. So, I'm just curious how you (knowing what you know now about the lifestyle, misery, etc... of severe opiate addiction) would prosecute/not-prosecute the Heroin/Opiate Pill Addicts who've been arrested and end up in your court room. Let's say the crime is something directly related to supporting his or her addiction. Lets say they've been charged with something like Theft Over $200 - a Class D Felony, and for all the other relevant factors USE YOUR CURRENT SITUATION TO FILL IN THE GAPS (aka just use YOUR current Criminal History, Financial Situation Determining Whether You'll Have A Paid Lawyer or just Public Pretender, Age, Race, Location, Employment, are you currently on Probation or Parole?, Etc..)

&#x200B;

Depending on where you live (probably keep that information to yourself a la sub rules) this crime in a large city might be considered next to nothing to you as a Judge because you see this type of crime all day, everyday with people supporting their habits. On the flipside a drug addict robbing someone or somewhere to support their drug habit - in a small town this might be looked at as a MAJOR, Serious big deal - where you'll be made out to be public enemy #1 (I've seen both.. Hell, I've lived both...Just depends on the City/Judge)

&#x200B;

Okay, myself... If I were the Judge preceding over a case like this, and we were in fact able to find this guy or girl guilty of theft I would force (say it's a girl) her to get a mental health evaluation, because we all know lots of drug addicts have a dual diagnosis and also suffer from mental illness on top of drug addiction... And generally speaking, most of the time, these mental health conditions are undiagnosed, and sadly even if they are diagnosed that's usually just about the end of their treatment. It's either way too expensive, or it's frustrating, confusing, and just overall very difficult to fucking find help out here once they know that you are a DRUG ADDICT (Dr's seem to really kind of just not give a fuck about opiate addicts and try to keep use at a distance away from them) .

&#x200B;

Fast Forward .. As the Judge I would make her complete an in depth mental health evaluation and to follow through with any and all recommendations that spawn from it. Also, if she is unemployed (which I assume she is because she's stealing for Oxys or Heroin). Then I would force her to complete a 30 Day inpatient rehab with AMA'ing resulting in an immediate warrant for her arrest & finally my ""Special Tactic"" I would COURT ORDER her to receive VIVITROL INJECTION every 30 days for 24 months... Any missed shots would result in an instant warrant for her arrest - with random drug testing several times a month looking for things like meth, coke, etc to biohack the Vivitrol Shot.

&#x200B;

So basically, I'd give her 24months probation w/ mandatory monthly vivitrol shots and lots of random drug testing and if she completed all this I would totally erase everything from her record. I would also require her to get job.

&#x200B;

What tactics would you use to try and help this person?? Knowing what you know now about the severity of opiate addiction and physical dependency/withdraw.  How do you feel about my idea of forcing a monthly Vivitrol Injection (if she didn't want it she absolutely did NOT have to accept that's what trails and lawyers are for.

Interesting read! I've always been skeptical about these sorts of things. I'm going to start trying them out for shits & giggles. I'd be interested to hear of people's personal experiences 😊🤘🇬🇧,"The Categories

In general opiate potentiators usually fall into one of these categories:

-	Antihistamines
-	CYP enzymes inhibitors
-	NMDA antagonists
-	Muscle-relaxants
-	Other CNS depressants
-	Phytochemicals

The Big List

There are literally dozens of chemicals that can potentiate opiates, many with similar mechanisms. We will start with the most well-known ones slowly move into the more novel ones as we go down the list.

-	Grapefruit Juice – The classic. Works by blocking the enzymes that metabolize opioids, thus increasing opiate concentration and duration. Usually, a 500ml of real 100% grapefruit juice will work fine. This is simple and works modestly for most people.

-	Cimetidine (also known as Tagamet) –  Works by occupying CYP enzymes that metabolize opioids (and other drugs), may not be great for the liver as it increases the workload on in. Anecdotally dosage is 800mg. Available over the counter. Works for about an hour. This is the choice for most people, but may affect the metabolization of codeine to morphine.

-	Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) – Less itchy and better effects. Inhibits histamine and increases the analgesic and mood properties of opiates to a small degree. In addition, they also inhibit a subset of CYP2D6.

-	Clonidine – Dosages 0.1mg to 0.3 mg. Stronger rush of effects. Sometimes quoted as the strongest potentiators also known as Catapres. 

-	Benzos – Not potentiation and a dangerous combination, but can be complementary to changing the effects of opiates at a low dose.

-	Quinine (Tonic Water) – makes opiates last longer and act stronger. It inhibits the CYP450 set, more specifically, CYP2D6. It doesn’t attach to as many enzymes as Cimetidine does, but it strongly attach to CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty.

-	Promethazine – Any other sedative anticholinergic antihistamine will work to reduce opiate side effects and potentiate analgesia. Take after administration of opiate not before.

-	CPM (Chlorpheniramine maleate) – Same as above.

-	Cyclizine – Same as above.

-	Anafranil  –A Tricyclic antidepressant that could potentiate opiates. Antidepressants pop up in patents for potentiation, but there doesn’t seem to be many anecdotal experiences on the web.

-	DXM – Actually a tolerance reversal and prevention agent, since it’s also an NMDA Antagonist, but we will pile it on this list. DXM is a whole potent analgesic drug itself. Dosage is 30mg of DXM a good half hour. This chemical is highly illegal in some countries (only available as cough syrup in some) due to potential for abuse. There is ample scientific evidence on this one but remains controversial.

-	Proglumide and Memantine – Proglumide naturally enhances opiate effects as well as reverses tolerance over time. Memantine is like DXM an NMDA antagonist, only its non-competitive so it doesn’t have any strong effects like DXM on its own. These are tolerance reversal and prevention agents and I would not classify them as strictly potentiators though they can be used in that way.

-	Magnesium – Efficacy is unknown as there are multiple forms of Magnesium. Magnesium also acts as an NMDA antagonist. Magnesium Maleate is usually the one quoted as having effects. If anything it is good at calming nerves and reducing things like bruxism.

-	Loperamide (Immodium) – 2mg. A little unclear whether this works or not. The theory is that loperamide occupy gut opiate receptors, thus freeing up more opiates to act on the brain. Seems to enhance analgesic effects more than mood effects, though.

-	Doxylamine Succinate (Active Ingredient in Nyquil) – Works to enhance effects, commonly used.

-	Orphenadrine – Anticholinergic used to treat muscle spasms, potentiator because it is strong anticholinergics. Acts on ALOT of mechanisms including being a moderate NMDA receptor antagonist.

-	Cyclobenzaprine – Same as above

-	Carisoprodol (Soma) – Same as above.

-	Propoxyphene – Huge potentiator of opium, but for other opiates it is unknown.

-	Naproxen – Non-selective COX inhibitor. Adds analgesia and increases mood effects. COX  inhibitors reliably have shown in studies and patents to potentiate opiate effects. Other drugs of the same class may have effects also.

-	Cat’s Claw – Increases Duration, specifically for Methadone. Also an NMDA antagonist too.

-	Baking Soda – Only necessary for oral ingestion affects PH of the stomach to allow more opiates to be absorbed into the blood.

-	Rhodiola and Ashwagandha – Clinical studies show potentiation and tolerance reversal. We have some other herbs listed in this blog post.

And there are probably others that can potentiate opiates, its hard to include everything ever. These other ones have reports of working, but don’t have confirmed mechanisms.

-	Black Seed Oil (cumin seed)
-	Hordenine (very minute amounts, 5 – 20mg, even. MAO-B inhibitor – works great if you don’t use too much)
-	Tribulus Terrestris (a milder MAO-B inhibitor. This is also great as it boosts testosterone and brings the ‘libido’ back which opiates can diminish)
-	DLPA (this is great unless your tolerance is high, then it doesn’t do much)
-	Curcumin (around 2g taken with Piperine – this potentiates the potentiator )
-	DMSO = yup, it’s a potentiator and it seems to feel similarly to how Hordenine & Tribulus bring the ‘magic’ back to strains when tolerance is being a ‘bitch’ so to speak. We are using this stuff for the soaps and lotions, that’s how rubbing the lotion = pain relief and relaxation. It’s an interesting product, look it up: DMSO (organic)

Example Extreme Opiate Potentiation Regiment

1.	Taking a combination of the CYP450 set inhibitors can drastically increase blood plasma levels of opiates.
2.	45 Minutes before administration – 10mg Memantine + 600mg Proglumide would be good to combine with a regiment to prevent further tolerance and withdrawal developing.
3.	45 Minutes before administration – 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), a large glass of tonic water (or another source of quinine), and a large glass of (white) Grapefruit juice, preferably from concentrate.
4.	35 Minutes before administration – 30mg DXM, 25mg Benadryl(Diphenhydramine HCl), 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
5.	20 Minutes before administration – 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
6.	T-0) Administrate your opiateopioid.

You can see how having a tolerance prevention regiment in place can pay off in big ways later, because you can continually use potentiation as needed instead of developing straight up tolerance to higher doses. This means better effects for longer, less side effects, less withdrawals, and a much longer sustainable usage of opiates in the long run.

i got clean awhile ago and got my life headed in the right direction. currently at grad school. handled personal life issues poorly, ended up doing suboxone for about a month. between 8-16mg a week for a month. then i did about 20 bags of dope over a week after i couldn't make it through withdrawal. i only made it 38 hours from my last dose before i felt terrified and bad and went out and bought a sub -kratom and weed and even xanax didnt help me with the restless legs and general anxiety. i took 2mg 2 hours ago and 2 more mg just now but i don't really feel anything. does suboxone no longer give you a high after you've done dope for a little bit? do i just need to take more? i don't think i put myself into precipitated withdrawal but i don't realy feel ""okay"". 

my last question is just about quitting: how much have i reset the process by taking subs today? were the 30some hours i spent pointless? do i have to wait for the subs to fade (fkn long half life) before i start making meaningful progress? i had been hoping to be somewhat clean/presentable for thanksgiving.

thank you so much for any help. i need to make a change now or im gonna lose everything, so i really appreciate any advice.

However, there’s almost no info about people having any experience with the instant or extended release version of this Tapentadol, medically let alone getting high.

Apparently Tapentadol 100mg = 20mg Oxycodone, and you can only take 600mg per day (there’s a cap like Tramadol)..

Long time lurker first time poster so sorry for any posting issues. 

Just posting this In response to the debate going on below in the oct codeine thread.  the truth is legalizing all drugs is truly the way to go. There are 2 countries in the the world that have done this and the usage, od rate and crime rate all went down. Youth drug rates are at historical lows in both countries.

Portugal- decriminalized 
Uruguay- all legal 

There is a great book called ""chasing the scream"" that starts from when all drugs were legal in the usa to now, or roughly 2015 when it was published. All the research is there both good and bad on both sides. I highly suggest those that think the war on drugs benefits anyone but corporations to read it.

I’ve lost about 15 pounds due to not being able to eat because of the pain. It literally hurts to talk. I have been getting absolutely no sleep due to the pain

I have another doctors appointment today and if I don’t get something for the pain I think I’m going to buy off the streets.

Also got sent home with a script for Hydrocodone Hycet and some more antibiotics.

Edit 2: dosage of the Hycet is 15mL every 4-6 hours or when needed I have i total of 180mL so that is 12 doses with no refills. Probably took my 8/10 pain and turned it to 4.5/10 and I am able to drink (uncomfortably) but I can lay in bed (comfortably) and this is the biggest selling point for me.

It reminds me of something that happened in my area years ago, during the 2nd wave of Fent (This is the 3rd wave, first 2 were from the same dude, he got of prison and started doing it again lol). Black dudes from Detroit had been dropping for weeks without anyone caring but once the suburban white girl OD'd they finally did a crack down, the news stories were written, etc.   


Then on top of it the movie version is clearly just riding the wave of opioid epidemic interest. They're digging mass graves on the East Coast, guys like ASavageLost have better tramadol stories than Nic Sheffield has stories involving his whole drug career, and they choose to make a film on this trustafarian and his turtleneck wearing crybaby dad.  


Sorry for the rant. I'm not a ""street kid"", and I'm not trying to gatekeep, but god it just seems like a WEAK story to get so much traction. Literally any AA/NA meeting will have people with much more interesting and inspirational stories.

Not today.

I was speaking to him the other day and he said he’s not sure why but he really misses the part of his life where he was in the hospital and always goes on about the amazing vivid dreams he would have, I suggested that him missing the hospital is likely due to the opiates he was on.

He said that since the incident he has been feeling pretty emotionless/depressed, I’m guessing this is apathy caused by the opiates.

He also says that if he gets the money to, when he’s older he wants to pay a doctor to put him on fentanyl once more with a safe dose, I said that it’s unlikely that he’d find a doctor that would do that, my concern is that he’s going to seek out something like heroin.

I was wondering how fast oxy tolerance goes down and at what rate? Some people say the tolerance is almost permanent or takes years but I always find that false 

I have been on my current oxy binge for about a month now and when I first began it I was taking 30 mg oxy at once.Eventually  my tolerance grew to about 60 mg oxycodone and most  recently 90 mg hydrocodone. 

But the thing is I haven’t touched a single opiate in 8 days. So I’m scared to just jump right in to 60mg at once, but at the same time don’t want 30 or 45 mg to be a let down.

What do you guys reckon? Should I just take the full 60 mg and just get extra high? At the same time I don’t want to make my tolerance go up if it doesn’t need to

I’m just really not sure, what do you guys think is the right dosage ?

Hear me out.,"Since so many of the numbers of disease tramsmission, infections and (often) OD's originate from IV use, why not move the harm reduction thinking over to a form of IV replacement? Like a safe dose kit.

It seems to me that using needles is a choice. There are many ways of dosing opioids without this dangerous method. I understand that OD's and other harm comes from these alternatives methods too, but if there was a safer (non-IV) way to use opioids, it would undoubtedly save lives. Many lives.

Opioids aren't going anywhere. So, what about inexpensive (manufactured) smoking kits? Clinic supplied transdermal patches? Trade-in centers where you trade powdered opioids (heroin) for pill form? 

The US Federal Government has monkeyed around for decades trying to shame users, help users, flip users, bust users, jail users etc. you can't tell me that a safer alternative to needles can't be designed. What do you guys think of focusing on safer dosing?

Edit: I'm not saying that this idea ""replaces"" IV, just that it could offer safety and a step back from danger. Anyone looking for a 100% replacement is asking too much. It's about compromise and safety. ",1542239073.0

Almost everytime I’m in a drug store I see someone buying over the counter tylenol with codeine in the largest quantity they can. Of course they have to ask the pharmacist for it, and the pharmacist is now required to insist on ID and record the sale so they can’t come back tomorrow when a different pharmacist is working and buy just as much again but it’s downright harmful that they sell this stuff with so much harmful APAP. Everyone (including the pharmacist) knows only too well that they are buying it for the codeine content and the large amount of acetaminophen aka paracetamol aka APAP is toxic to the liver. **For the love of God I wish they would just give opiate addicts their opiates without insisting on poisoning them!**  This stupid war on drugs is just so wrong and can never be won.

Desperate I actually asked plug 1 (P1) it she knew anyone else I would ask , she gives me a name but says not to mention her name at all . I start small talk with potential new plug (PNC) right away , we question and validate each other's credibility and after about a week I decide to give him a shot. I mention to P1 that I'm gonna give PNP a shot and she says ""Nooooo!! Don't! He'll short you !! He's got garbage!! He'll rob you!!"" Ummm, ok? Whyd you give me his info then I'm thinking right? Scares me off a little bit but the next day I say fuck it and go thru PNP. I needed at like 7am; he was not only awake but responded to my messages in line under 5 minutes. Ok, my first WOW. Then, he tells me to come meet him now, which was like 20 minutes from the beginning of our conversation that day. I go straight there and he comes out immediately , weighs in front of me , takes cash and then we split ways. Whole thing took like45 minutes with driving . First reliable, quick no bullshit plug I've deait with since I started using H. So wtf P1?? Why give me his info if all that shit is true?? Just hating because he got good good.

I've consistently been buying from this guy now (who has now become my main plug! Fuck P1 & P2 lol) I drop by last night and grab enough to last thry the night . Me and my friend go p/u together then head to our spot to dose. I know this shits good and Im pretty good about knowing hm I can do to get high the way I like. Well , after I do my first blast I barey remember anything EXCEPT coming to with my friend asking me wtf I'm talking about. Apparently I'd go on and on about shit that made no sense and at first he'd ask wtf I was talking about or just keep saying my name over and over til I'd come back so to speak.  After like the 3rd 4th time, I'd come to and feel terrified because at that point I was like hearing myself say these things that made no sense at all.  I was genuinely scaring myself with my own words. I'd be talking about someone who I didn't know or talking about being in a place that we were not at . The last time it happened I had kind of a breakdown, I just didn't and still don't understand where that information came from. Also I guess I scared the shit out of my friend. Ive been using 3.5-4 yrs now and I've never experienced anything that intense before. I've nodded out and came to talking to myself before lol but this was like detailed recollections or conversations . Have you experienced anything like this before?? Someone plz!! Relate to me!!

(Because of its opioid properties?),"So I know its a novel dissociative analog of pcp but this particular one has affinty for some opioid receptors and i always remembered when i experimented with it, I would experience relief from opiate WDs immediately.

> The drug also has high affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) (Ki = 39–60 nM),[2][3][4][5] the κ-opioid receptor (KOR) (Ki = 140 nM),[4] and the sigma σ1 receptor (Ki = 42 nM; IC50 = 19 nM),[4][6][7][8] whereas it has only low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (Ki = 2,300 nM).[4] The high affinity of 3-HO-PCP for opioid receptors is unique among arylcyclohexylamines and is in contrast to PCP, which has only very low affinity for the MOR (Ki = 11,000–26,000 nM; 282- to 433-fold difference) and the other opioid receptors (Ki = 4,100 nM for the KOR and 73,000 nM for the DOR).[3][4]


3-meo-pcp and 3-ho-pcp worked as functional drugs I could use short term for instant antidepressant/anxiolytic effects. Looking for a everyday-/+ functional drug, Im on subs, not trying to get back on opiates, tolerance to amps/stims is too high and I cant afford them or sleep if i take them more than once or twice a week.


**So my question is, first of all, im on ~ 8 - 12 mg subs a day, Will the suboxone block the opioid properties of this drug making it less effective? Basically will I have to wait 24+ hrs after sub for this to work, like i would for opiates?**


2nd, If I take 3-ho-pcp and dose my sub, say a few hrs later, will doing this cause precipitated WD like it would if I took an opiate while on sub? Will I have to wait for the 3-ho to leave my system, or until im in WD, to take sub? (Assuming that taking the 3-ho in the right dose will alleviate most/some WD replacing sub)?


**So to make things short, can I use suboxone and 3-ho-pcp together, or do I need to treat the 3-ho just like any other opiate when using it alongside subs?** 

If I can't use them together, what about other pcp analogs? O-PCE, 7-ho-PCE, 3-meo-pcp etc??

Hear me out. Just over the past two months, the following things have happened to me

-My DNM Bitcoin wallet gets hacked, among others, and I lose $80 that I planned on buying Oxy with.
-I've gotten robbed by TWO heroin/Oxy dealers
-The one time I have a legitimate deal set up to buy heroin, there is a FUCKING COP CAR parked right around the corner, with a cop in it. The dealer refused to sell to me as the dumb fuck thought I was a cop just because my neighbor is.
-Not one, not two, but THREE packages I've ordered now have gone ghost. One package I ordered from a vendor I've bought from twice by now, one package from a vendor with shitty ratings, and one package from a vendor with really good ratings. The one with shitty ratings got refunded to me and the one that I've bought from before claims to have sent a reship, which I am still waiting on.

All of these things have happened within a course of two months, no way in hell it's all just a coincidence. I genuinely have the feeling some type of higher power is trying to prevent me from using opiates. I know I'm probably just paranoid but has this ever happened to anyone else? I'm extremely desperate for opiates and any good vibes that can be sent my way are extremely appreciated.

I’ve been seeing a lot of posts lately asking people what the most fucked up thing they did for opiates was and boy have I got a story for you guys....

Now usually it’s the dboy making the girls suck him off for the goods right? But see boys, it’s the 21st mothafuckin century and we don’t do oppressive gender role shit no more. Girls have rights now an can do everything a man can and that’s exactly what happened in this story. 

So this all starts in 2016. 
I had just recently got into opiates and was living on my own with my brother and after a 7 day straight opiate/meth/coke and mdma binge/massive party we had at our house (it was a really nice place in the country, we supported it by dealing stims but I won’t get into that) we were crashing hard and I mean HARD! 
For the first time in my life I started to feel real withdrawals along with a comedown straight from the seventh layer of hell itself and my go to remedy (oxy) was all gone. 
I knew my script wouldn’t get filled again for another two weeks but my brother and I’s withdrawals were not gonna wait that long so we had to come up with a solution fast! Now this is where the title comes into play... 

There was this girl we use to know who was hopelessly infatuated with us during our younger years and recently she had become pretty big into opiates and was known around town for dealing. My brother and I hadn’t talked with her in years but we knew she would reply right away if we hit her up because of how infatuated she use to be with my older brother and I.

We hit her up and told her we needed some opiates fast! 
We didn’t give a fuck what kind we just needed something because on top of our withdrawals we were coming down off a 7 day meth, molly coke and oxy binge and we’ve got no landing gear. 
I mean we were crashing harder than a pair of 767’s into the World Trade Center. 

She replies ASAP and says she’s got OC 80’s. 
THANK GOD! 
She tells us she’s already super fucked up so we’re gonna have to drive to her. 
No problem, if we can drive on meth we can drive during withdrawals. 
We then ask her how much she wants per pill and this is where it gets nuttier than squirrel shit.... 

I get a paragraph long, detailed description of how this bitch wants my brother and I to pull a train on her in exchange for the oxy and she’s not gonna accept cash.... 
Before my bro and I even have time to process this bill Cosby, come get my pudding bullshit I get another Snapchat.
It’s a photo this time but see I’m already in the worst state of mind of my life so i say fuck it and open it. 
No joke, this bitch straight up sent us a close up photo of her butthole with the caption “looks good huh boys?(;”. 
Now see, I’m not opposed to some groceries and neither is my brother but see we haven’t talked to this girl in years and she’s as fat as your mother and probably has more bugs than your computer after downloading limewire in the early 2000’s..

My brother and I both are in complete shock but we don’t have any fucking time to process this because this is the only plug in town and if we don’t get some oxy soon we are FUCKED! 
We hop our asses in the car and head out to this bitches house. 
I swear to god this car ride felt like we were in a landing craft about to storm the beaches of Normandy...
We both knew what was about to go down once those doors opened but we’re just two young men who don’t have a choice and we’ve got a job to do. 

Que 45 minutes of some horribly regrettable sex and occasional awkward eye contact with each others dicks, she told us she was satisfied and we could have 3, oc80’s each. 
Now that wasn’t good enough for my brother and I. 
I mean we straight up moby dicked this bitch for almost an hour with no prior whaling experience and we needed good compensation for our time so we managed to convince her to give us 6 each instead. 
In hindsight, we made it out of there rich as kings but good god did we feel like human garbage... 

We immediately pop one OC each as we get into the car and we were gone faster than cake at a fat kid’s birthday party... 

We get back home and by now each of us were right about to retire to our rooms and enjoy our nods (preferably in a bath of hydrogen peroxide) when we both get a notification on Facebook from the girl. 

To this day I don’t know why, but we accepted her friend request and no more than 10 minutes later we see on our newsfeed that she updated her status.
All it said was:
Another win for feminism.

Hope you guys enjoyed this because I sure as hell didn’t but it’s been a few years so I figured I’d finally share this one.
That was by far the worst thing I had ever done for drugs and for some reason the biggest revelation I got out of it that day was “man feminism has come a long way”. 

I’m clean and sober now and finishing up my doctorate in pharmacology and doing well. 
I managed to not get any STD’s from her and for those sensitive fucks out there, I have nothing against feminism and I have zero prejudice, I just needed to share this story and that’s just the way it happened. 
Figured this sub was perfect for this and as always guys, 
Happy nods.

9wxnz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9wxnz6/how_much_of_phyiscal_withdrawal_do_you_think_is/,7,https://redd.it/9wxnz6,LittleBigCheeks,How much of phyiscal withdrawal do you think is actually mental?,"I have been thinking about this a lot today. First, I want to say that I'm not implying physical wds are made up or exaggerated in any way, or that people are not suffering during wd, because I've been through it countless times and know as well as you guys that it's a living hell. Obviously, there are clear, awful physcial symptoms.

I also already know that there is a huge mental part to withdrawal. The anxiety, depression, restlessness, hopelessness, and boredom is definitely the hardest part for me and lasts longer than physical wds. My question is simply, do you think some part of the *physical* symptoms are actually more *mental*?

I definitely think so, to some degree. I was just pondering this while thinking how some of my detoxes seemed strangely easy and some seemed impossible. For example, the first time I ever got dope sick, I was out of town and didn't even know what was happening. I thought I had a bad flu and I was also having crying spells, but it wasn't *that* bad. When I finally used again and felt better, I did some research and realized that I was in too deep and physically addicted.

Of course, as that was my first time wding, my addiction wasn't as heavy at the time so I know that's the main reason it seemed bearable. Mentally, though, I think that not even knowing I was wding made it easier, because I hadn't yet realized another bag would cure all. Like, I was wondering if a non-addict could suddenly experience wd symptoms without knowing it's wd, would they find it more tolerable than an addict? Would it be easier because they would not also be struggling with mental addiction, and would just resign themselves to ""I've got a bad flu, just need to get through this""? I think knowing there's such an easy solution to the physical symptoms makes it more difficult.

Similarly, I find that the more bearable detoxes, both with and without Suboxone, are when I'm resigned to quit. When I'm prepared for what's coming and I know getting more dope is not an option, the wds a little more tolerable than when I'm just out of dope, or when I'm half-heartedly trying to get clean. Then it just seems like the worst.

My easiest detoxes have been with Suboxone, but even then, I've had some terrible ones where the 24 hours waiting to take the sub is complete hell and I don't make it, because I don't really want to quit and I know a bag will fix it. Yet, when I'm determined to get clean, there have been times when I'm surprised at how easy the 24 hours were, and then the sub obviously helps and a week later, I'm like damn! That wasn't bad at all! Again, I'm strictly talking about physcial symptoms, I of course still struggle mentally. But my experience indicates to me that the physical aspect is a little mental as well. One last example was rehab; I did a quick sub taper but did not start the subs until 36 hours in. Though not the easiest 36 hours, they were better than other times simply because I knew I had no other option. After those hours I was medicated, so it was obviously fine.

I know that sometimes addicts want to quit but are too scared of withdrawal, and I think anticipating horrible physical symptoms could actually make it worse.

What do you guys think?",1542177850.0

I’ve had a taste for them ever since I was 14 getting my wisdom teeth out. I’ve always been able to manage it since then.

However, this summer, I did heroin for the first time. I’ve done it a few times since, and have been introduced to withdraws. Seeing as how I don’t have access to pills, I buy more heroin when I’m withdrawing to take away the pain. This prolongs the cycle and has happened probably 5 times since I first bought heroin. Since trying it, it's all that I really want. 

I’m really teetering on the line right now between functioning and full blown addict. I’m in a relatively large college in my senior year as a financial consulting major. My grades have begun to suffer at such a crucial point in my life (job search) and I’m radically depressed right now as I withdraw.

I know the only option is to stop. Are there any rehabilitation services or centers available to someone like me who absolutely cannot reveal to anyone close to them (including parents) that they are addicted to heroin and still attend college class? My ability to pay for this would be limited as my funds are currently still tied to my parents.

If you’re going to cast judgment, please do not. I have thought long and hard about my mistakes and have beaten myself up enough. I'm incredibly self-sabotaging and I would really like to change my way of living. I wish that I could wake up happy again, go through life without being miserable that I'm not doped up.",1542169847.0
