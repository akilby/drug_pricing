so, I live in MD , inbetween baltimore and dc and lately I'm seeing to be getting garbage, i dont really have anyone I *always* go to since it all sucks to me, but the one guy I do go to just because he will deliver, well his dope ALWAYS gives me ""pins and needles"" I never knew what that was last year, until a couple months ago, because I always got a normal good feeling rush. But with this shit, I get pins and needles SO bad, in my hands, and feet and even head to the point where it HURTS. and itches at the same time. but it hurts real bad. My question is, is it from the cut? 

I should probably also mention, I am on 41mg methadone, been on it for months now and luckily haven't went above 50 or something like that. ( Don't want to be stuck on it forever like many people I see there. I'm 24, and see people in their 70's and shit here looking terrible) 

Another question I have is, is it unreasonable to   expect for some of the dope I buy (once I can actually find some decent shit, :( ) to give me a rush , being that I'm on 41mg methadone? Last summer, I had a good connect, and the shit had to have been fentanyl, because it was so ""clean"" I put a TINY little pebble in the spoon, and then water and it dissolved perfectly, nothing left behind, water the same color as when I put it in, and anyway, that shit hit me so hard , even through the 20 or so mg methadone (was weening off at the time) I started running down stairs so incase I fell out, I'd be by my family or they'd hear me tumble down the stairs lmao.


The other day , my friend introduced me to some stuff called ""Flatline"" , it's scramble & I thought it must be good, because his ex girlfriend literally died a few days ago from it (ironic name, I know) so I try it and yeah, it made me nod a little bit, but I got no rush. Maybe I was too scared to do as much as I should have, since I am already on methadone, have never OD'ed in my life and try my best to have it remain that way. But anyway, the flatline is gone now, and it's back to the garbage, bullshit , junk dope that I've only been able to find, and I dont wanna go back to the pins and needles shit either because that just hurts and doesnt make me tired, or nod or anything :(

Sorry for the random questions, and shitty formatting of this post. I know I could have done better, but I guess I am kinda in a rush. Thanks for any and all help people, and be safe.

Turning 27 in a week. Had a friend in college who had a roommate that would IV OC 80s. Decided to get one randomly and found out why people got addicted to it. From then I had a few different group of friends start doing 30mg percs and would do them from time to time, and you guys know how the story goes.....doing half a pill only at night to waking up a only filling content/fulfilled by doing 3 a day. I know my use is low compared to others in this sub but my urges are real, my overdrawing my accounts have been too many, and when I w/d I can't sleep, boners off the wazz and shits for days. Did a line of heroin once but that's it. Been trying to quit the last 2 years, was off for a few months and ended up right back into the cycle and it's been 10months, tax returns down the drain, suppose to have saved 6k from work since May but haven't saved a dime. Starting Pharm school in the fall so I've been on subs hoping to be clean and clear by September just enough to get the grades I need. Luckily I'll be moving away 1.5hr from where I live so that'll help. Just worried I won't be able to study and concentrate when the time comes. 

Btw, the 5 years of use first year was mostly 1/2 a pill to 1 and only got everyday at the end. After that I stopped for 4 months, only got diarrhea. When I came back home I started right back up for another year, and by the end of that year I bumped to 2/day. Stopped for 6 months, then got back into it for a couple months maybe 6months straight was use. Then a 4month break   and at that point my w/d got to the point I had RLS, sleep sucked for 5 days, felt a little off mentally for 2 weeks like a fog. Since then I've gone on a spree and now I'm at 3/day. Worried that my w/d quitting this time won't be so easy and that the PAWS will be bad enough that I won't be able to study when the time comes. I'm thinking of supplementing with neutropics and maybe even try and get a prescription for provagil for a few months. Sorry for the wall of text but I feel that this was the only way to get a good picture of my usage. Never IV, always crushed and sniffed them. Kindve wished I found this sub sooner and learned about protentiating! Btw, on day 3 of subs right now. Been doing a 1/4 pill of the 8mg subs* twice a day and I have 3 more 1/4 left until I'm out. That's how I had quit the last two times was using subs to get me through the first few days to get myself mentally prepared for the w/d",1470057497.0

Well I'm trying that right now and the following is my experience over the last 4 or so days (I'm loosing track of time). I can tell you I have gone into full acute withdrawal very quickly by experiementing with 2 CYP3A4 inducers. 

But before that for those who do not understand what I am talking about CYP3A4 is the main enzyme that metabolizes Subutex which is directly responsible for its breakdown and half life. Inhibiting the CYP3A4 enzyme created in the liver will cause Subutex to be broken down at a much slower rate making it build up in your blood and causing you to either get super high or not go into withdrawal much longer and needing to dose lower and/or less often. 

The oposite should also be true that inducing the CYP3A4 enzyme should theoretically eat up the Subutex from your system at a much faster rate causing you to need higher doses to stay well and go into withdrawal much faster needing to increase your dose or theorically get through withdrawal faster.

So now on to my method and my current experience which my near psychosis is now making me question if this is such a great idea or am I just torturing my self for no reason. I started by using DHEA cream which is a known CYP3A4 inducer and I started feeling sick very fast after jumping ship from Subutex at about 2 mg a day (tapering was not going well and I was sick of stretching out the torture just wanting to get it over with and start living life again before I fell into heroin and subseuqntly went on Subutex cause its's cheaper). 

I got sick on the same day as I stopped taking Subutex but repeated dosing of DHEA was to much and I felt like my hormone levels were becoming unbalanced so I switched to Modafinil which is an awakefulness agent known to potently increase CYP3A4 activity starting with 200 mg which put me into acute withdrawal which from reading on the net seems to start somewhere between day 5 up to 12 depending on the person going cold turky normally.
OMG the feeling was so intense but i beared through it taking another small dose later in the afternoon cause it felt like it was wearing off. Come night time though I start to feel a little bit better but no sleep at all coming to me (nor for the next few nights). 

So the next day I up the Modafinil dose to 250 mg and at first I feel great! getting out of bed at 5 30 am in the detox facility I am in with no sleep behind me for the last 2 days, full of energy, positivity and I start doing the laundry by hand (this is a really cheap and ghetto facility and they barely monitor you so having pills in here or drugs is not that hard to get away with provided you came with them when you first got here). Then it hits me, I start feeling like garbage, pupils dialate, blood pressure increasing, have to poop. I start muching on Clonidine and Loperamide pills (the latter making sure not to take enough to get out of withdrawal but enough to not have dhiarria).

Blood pressure is skyrocketing, having to take more clonidine then I can keep track of, more loperamide, I'm starting to go into a panic and having intease fear like a bad LSD trip. Seeing slight trails when I move my hands and colored bad reception TV static in the air. I come out and ask my friend who is one of my roomates if he can come to the room to talk with me but I can bearly get the words out of my mouth before I break out in sobs and tears. He sits with me and reassures me that I am ok and that I will get through this. 

I'm trying to calm down but I keep feeling crazier and crazier and I'm trying to do everything in my power to hold on to this ride to hell trying to remember that I will come out of it eventually and my hopes are high with this method that will come sooner then later. I can't tell if the increase in stimulation from the Modafinil is causing this insanity or the increase in CYP3A4 activity is causing higher withdrawal. I take another small dose of 100 MG come afternoon after things start calming down so I ride it out till night time where I spend yet another night with 0 sleep. 

Trying not to make the same mistake again here we are today where at 5 30 am again I took a mear 150 mg of Modafinil and again my sickness increases heavily. Blood pressure again shoots through the roof, need to poop, eyes wide. Feeling more energy and withdrawal but it's nowhere near as intense as 200 or 250 mg and this I can tolerate.  

But questions come into my mind like how long is this going to go on for? wouldn't of all the Subutex already of been eaten up by now? Should'nt I be already coming out of this and feeling much better? Is this experiment really making any sense or will it end up just being more intense and just as drawn out as any other cold turkey withdrawal from Subutex. 

Am I feeling less intense today because of the lower Modafinil dose or am I getting better? I can't tell whats going on here anymore and loosing my will and motivation but seeing no other option other then leaving here and scoring some smack (oooo baby how good that would feel right now) but I know in the long run that's bad news and I have started a new program called SMART Recovery (smartrecovery.org) which is really helping me put things into perspective and giving me a lot of hope that this time I will be able to stay clean and start the life I have been dreaming about for years.

Anyway I'm unsure where this is going or whats going on but I wanted to share my experience and experiement, put the idea out there and see what yall think what ever that may be.  Maybe this is working and perhapse if others want to try it to we can see if this could be the answer to a faster recovery. I'l put an update post one day but I want to put my experience out here now while I am still going through it. 

Clonadine all day baby couldn't do it with out it. 

UPDATE (just a few hours after I wrote the original post): Geez I wish I would of just waited a little bit longer to write this cause its now mid day and I am no longer feeling acute withdrawal. I took another 150 of Modafinil cause the effects wore off but the acute withdrawal symptoms have not returned. 

My blood pressure is also really low now so to me all this adds up to meaning that this enzyme induction method worked and got me through the acute stages of Subutex withdrawal in about 4 days which as hard as it was was well worth it. 

Now I'm waiting for all this clonidine i took to wear off cause this is pretty uncomfortable. The Clonidine stuck around after the acute phase ended and now i'm glued to my bed cause the acute withdrawal seems to be over and is no longer causing mega high blood pressure which now means really low blood pressure. 

Now I am expecting Subutex PAWS which I guess will take a bit to get out of but the passing through hell seems to be over and  I'm really glad I did this experiment and I hope this info helps others.

I just want to stress if your going to try this method to speed up your Subutex detox have a good amount of Clonidine around. I'v been through heroin withdrawal before and taken clonidine but never had to take this much it was really unreal how much I was eating and my blood pressure continued to go up. 

I don't know if you will get through the acute stage in 4 days but it worked for me jumping at 2 mg. Also keep in mind this might not work out as well for you we all have different body chemistry so understand if you do this your outcome might not be the same so it's at your own risk. 

In addition I want to add that I take and took through this ordeal LOTS of nutritional supplements which are to many to list here and I don't want to spend the time. Just know that I took supplements in what are considered mega-doses (but I just consider them effective doses) around 3-4 times a day (which is regular for me even when I am not in withdrawal). I take vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, etc and I know it helped me through this just like it has helped me in regular life. 

Oh well I guess I'l see where this is heading with the PAWS and how long its going to take me to get back to normal but all in all I would call this experiment a great success and I'm very happy I did it.

I may write another post or update in the near future after I heal to normalcy to describe what happened in the month or more to come and how long it took me to come back to life. As of now I expect I will be struggling with PAWS issues mostly insomnia which is always the main issue I have when I stop using drugs.

When we met she was suppling it and now a year later and 2 months pregnant she's given me a ultimatum of quitting or losing her and my unborn. 
 
Now before we had met I had a heavy habit that had grown out of a naïve love of oxys and eventually dope came in when pills lost all effect for the most part. Then G a day quickly grew to 4g and stayed that way until meeting her. I started cutting back since she wanted out of the drug life her family threw her into. These days I've barely been doing anything. Kept it at a G to G and half a week and still she looks at me like I'm doing 4g. I barely get a nod just a nice warm feeling and away from what comes when clean after nearly a decade of opiate abuse.

Now I've tried it all to get off and best I had was 7 months and that was hell, still craved on a daily basis and don't want that again.

Basically, kratom makes my opiate withdrawal symptoms worse than using nothing at all.  Every time I take it when I run out of pills, I get hit by an overwhelming fatigue, start yawning uncontrollably, my eyes water, stomach hurts & I start to shiver.  E-v-e-r-y time.  

Is kratom an opioid *anta*gonist?  Is there anything I could do to negate these stupid effects?  I've only used low doses around 1-5 grams.  Will a bigger dose only make things worse?  

My drug of choice is dihydrocodeine, about 140mg per day.  So nothing crazy.  

((This is definitely not a fluke or me mis-attributing these effects to the wrong thing.  It's kratom 100%.  Doesn't matter the strain, the effects are the same.  The nasty w/d feeling starts within 15 minutes of drinking kratom tea and is even worse if I do the toss 'n wash method.  I've been trying to use kratom as a backup opiate for over 5 years and it's always the same story)).

He was using heroin for 3 years. I asked if he was injecting it and he said no, but then I looked at his arms and he told me yes he was. I know from what I was told that the prescription medication and heroin is the same but heroin is my worst fear for him and confirming it was very scary. I’ll admit I lost my composure for a while. I offered him rehab and he said he didn’t want it because he can quit on his own at home. I don’t know if that’s a good idea but I want to trust him and give him the chance to do it. He offered to take drug tests to prove that he was being honest. He doesn’t want some of his friends and our extended family to know about his problem so I think maybe I should give him the chance and if it doesn’t work we’ll talk about other options.

I spoke to a pharmacist about narcan because it was mentioned several times and I am so thankful I asked here and was told about it.

I went to fill the prescription shortly after the visit and the pharmacist informed me that they cannot fill it bc it had been written for the next day, my doctor is an old guy so I don't know if he did that mistakenly or if he had some sort of reason but he definitely didn't forewarn me.
A friend suggested that I just wait until midnight and go to one of Walgreens 24/7 pharmacies since I was supposed to leave early in the morning for a trip I was going on, so thats what I did. As soon as I got to the pharmacy and handed the pharmacist my script she looked at me weird and said ""I have a few questions"" and asked me when my appointment had been, I told her it had been earlier in the afternoon, she asked if there had been any reason it was written for the next day and I honestly told her I wasn't aware of any, that was just the way it had been given to me. 

She got really angry at me and yelled ""I know you did not just have this written, it's 12:30 AM and no doctor would give this to you!"" even though I had told her he had prescribed it to me this afternoon.. She told me what I was doing was illegal and that she would not help me and threw my script and ID and insurance card back at me in my car.

Has anybody heard of this? I've never tried to fill a prescription at midnight, never been prescribed a pain killer in the first place so I guess I didn't predict how sensitive pharmacies would be about filling it... I've filled other prescriptions like BC and antibiotics at Walgreens all the time so I'm definitely in their system.

I'm sure this is the approximate temperature many other places, which makes long-sleeved shirts unthinkable. Unfortunately, here in Houston the humidity is also ridiculous making cosmetics pretty damn uncomfortable and as a result, also crossed off my list. So I present a less than groundbreaking solution... 

Big ol' Hawaiian shirts! 

Now, their crook-covering capabilities are compromised if you raise your arms over your head and let the sleeves fall down, but otherwise work quite well. Some selling points: it's summer, so Hawaiian shirts are totally acceptable to wear. Hawaiian shirts specifically are perfectly okay to wear a couple sizes too big, providing that extra sleeve length. They're typically on the thin side of things, so you won't sweat your ass off. They're technically button ups, so you can look a little nicer (possibly) than your typical junkie self, I know I do. Also, most (not all) are made with a front pocket- use it for whatever you want! I keep a pack of cigarettes in mine. Lastly, I think they're fucking comfy, but that may just be me. 

There's my suggestion, hope someone can benefit from it. I went ahead and converted my wardrobe to center around Hawaiian shirts (read: I bought a lot of shorts from Goodwill) and haven't had any issues covering up at work/restaurants/getting pulled over.

Not on speaking terms with my family anymore cause I'm such a dick. Just really lonely. I was kinda seeing someone or whatever but he violated his parole yesterday with an assault charge so. Just, what's the point in anything if you're not high? Just want some Xanax, meth and heroin. I was clean for a year, did the NA thing. Wanted to die every day. NA thing ain't for me no mas. I live at a sober house too can't even get away with getting a script. Moving out is just too damn hard til I get a car. Then what? And on top of everything I got fat. What the fuck. Days like today the only thing that gets me through... I don't know. Just wanna go to sa pick up and od like fuck it. Why don't I? Last time I ODd on heroin and Xanax I regretted it. That feeling before you die and there's nothing you can do about it and you're like, oh shit I fucked this up. This ain't right. Did I mention I got fat? Gained 30 lbs this year. BMI is still 22 but still what the fuckkkkkkkkkk. Why don't I go get some tar. OD. What the fuxk of its so bad stop complaining you fucking pussy stop bitching and just go do it. Fuck",1470147209.0
4vslwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4vslwf/stupid_tramadol_questions/,4,https://redd.it/4vslwf,_lysol,Stupid Tramadol questions,"Hey guys. So basically, I haven't gotten high in about 6 months and all I have is 250mg Tramadol (I know, I know). In theory even that should knock me on my ass somewhat but I have a few questions that make things a little dicier.

1. I'm currently taking both Remeron 30mg and Effexor 75mg. From what I understand, both these medications create the risk of Serotonin Syndrome when used with Tramadol.

2. I'm going to be drug tested in the not-so-distant-at-all future. I have no idea whether or not the test is going to be a standard piss cup or sent to a lab (as part of an IOP-type program), but could it, in theory, show up?

Thanks guys. I was this close to saying ""Fuck it"" last night and popping them but held back. I'd appreciate any info/tips/whatever. Happy nods to all!!

It's important to understand how it all works. A good hour of solid research, then another hour in various rooms confirming it, and you will have a very good idea about it all. 

There are a lot of myths and much misinformation around it all. 

Subutex is Buprenorphine.
Suboxone is Buprenorphine with added Naloxone.
Buprenorphine is the opiate that does the job.
Naloxone is added only to deter injecting buprenorphine. 
Buprenorphine is an opiate, it satisfies cravings. It is a long lasting, powerful, and dominating opiate. It takes over your receptors from other opiates. 
Naloxone is the opposite. It kicks all opiates out of the system. Not dominates.....kicks out. 
Interestingly, and the reason why this works, Naloxone is NOT absorbed properly in the mouth, but buprenorphine IS. Conversly, Naloxone activates when injected. 

If you take buprenorphine before you are deep enough into withdrawals, the bupe will dominate the other opiates and launch you into precipitated withdrawals. 

If you inject Suboxone you will activate the Naloxone which will purge your system of all opiates and ALSO send you into precipitated withdrawals but in a different WAY.",1470144662.0

Kinda sad finding these because it's been 10 years and I'm still using. This is my first experience with opiates and the first bit of repercussions. If only I stopped then!  Enjoy.

Let me try and lay some ground work for you guys. My name is William and I was raised in Vegas. When I was in elementary school my best friend was named Joseph. He was the alpha of the group and I’d mostly tag along doing what he did, thinking whatever he thought was cool was. My brother who is just a year older then me was always really close until I turned 16. He became Mr.Popular while I had my escapism. The first thing that took me away was punk rock in 3rd grade. Not real stuff but the punk-o-Rama garbage but hey the quality isn’t what matters. It was a voice telling me I can be different from these people and no one is absolutely right. Like when I was waiting for pre-school to start in my moms car and The Ramones- Beat on the Brat came on. I didn’t know what it was but I knew it was for me. Elementary school was full of Resident Evil and Romero. Towards middle school the film, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly made me want to make art. Think it was the first time art connected with me on a personal level. Where I was completely enveloped in the medium and all my problems, grades and homework and dating and friends became all so fickle when I’d listen to Ennio Morricone. This beautiful, tangible thing will be there for me. I can listen when the world has given up and life is at its worst I could still have this for myself. They can take away and break me down but I’ll still have Ennio. And so it grew to the Smiths, Fugazi, Joy Division, Iggy Pop, David Bowie. Dropping a few as I get older while I pick up others but Ennio remaining a constant. The first time Joseph asked if I wanted to smoke weed I was in 6th grade. Told my mom I was going to spend the night at his house after a night of bowling. I didn’t end up feeling anything but we started doing it more often. Eventually I started to feel it but it did the exact opposite of what I had thought it would or learned in dare. It made me more awkward but I was happy to have a friend. We started looking up to Hunter S Thompson after watching the Johnny Depp movie and a few years later after a few shitty Chuck Palahniuk books i moved on to HST then after the rum diary I learned of The Sun Also Rises. Tackled Hemingway and the lost generation stuff in 11th grade and it blew up from there. Reading is the second best form of escapism and by far my favorite because not only does it harden your own personal outlook it helps you find answers for questions you’ve been asking you’re entire life only you weren’t aware you were looking. Opiates and synthetic opioid derivatives are the ultimate form of escapism. Some people can take them and be just fine but I was in love since day one. I walked into my parents room when I was 16. That week my mom forced me to go to the barber shop for a flat top so I was really down on myself. My brother turned around in a panic and once he knew it was me he calmed down. He opened a bottle and threw me a few pills that looked like aspirin. 
“What is this”?
""Just take it bro! It will make you feel good. But don’t tell mom and dad.“
That night I was reborn. Suddenly the pain from walking through the school halls vanished. The fear of being anything was gone. At that moment I could have told God himself to Fuck off and he would. This is how others must feel. That was the only time I saw my brother take those. I think they just made him sick. I started to take some every morning. One at first and it was plenty. Before I knew it I had a girlfriend and was living like a kid my age should. 
A few months pass and one Sunday we go out to eat with my family. Everything is fantastic and when we get home my brother and I are called into my parents room. My father dumps out his pills on the bed and says count them. 
""8, 8 pills dad”, Jonny 
He stares at me 
“8….”
My heart tries to leave my body behind because….,
My dad flops the pill lid over with a big ten on it. Jonny seems super confused as I remain quiet. He says 
“I swear dad. That wasn’t me.”
Everyone is looking his direction as all the remorse crashes in. 
“ it’s was me I’m so sorry. I need help!”
My dad slaps me across the face.
“Oh great my sons a fucking drug addict. I never want to see you again” 
Mom chimes in as I hold my face,
“You want to be high all the time. You don’t care about us”
“I do care I just can’t stop”
“Wow its so important to you that you can’t stop”
Jonny looks at me right in the face,
“I can not believe you”,
as he proceeds to spit on it,
I walk to my room. Never so low. The guilt killed me. They all refused to talk to me for over a month. This should of been the last time something like this would happen but it’s only the first of many. 
They ended up giving my truck to Jonny I got on my 16th birthday. Never drove it once. I walked to high school till I graduated. 
At least I had Ennio Morricone and they could never take that",1470119150.0

I've been on suboxone for 6 months after spending 3 years with a opiate addiction that lead to a gram a day of strong philly ecp dope habit. Went on subs and tapered from 24mg to 4mg. Now my insurance is running out but im sick of subs and want off anyway. So I planned on using serious self restraint and going back on dope snorting only just enough to stay well and avoiding the best I can any high for 2-3 weeks and quitting off that rather than going through the long hell that is sub withdrawl. 

Since I got myself a 100 mgph patch I was wondering if I used that last if because Of fents fast half life I could maybe go through shity but fast withdrawls and be in the clear after 2-3 once the suboxone is totally out of my system. Has anyone ever done this does it make withdrawl faster when taken as a patch or is fent only so fast when it's abused by chewing or smoking or whatever. Should I try going on fent or stay on dope and quit. I've been doing pretty well and managed to stay on only a point of dope a day half a point in the morning and half in the pm. 

Does anyone know a good conparison for how strong this 100 patch is. I found conversions but they don't really help to take in all of the equivalent at once. I was hoping to hear what it should feel like in terms of oxy across a day like is it like taking a op 80? I have no clue how strong this patch is? If it's not the gel type can I cut it and try half first and do the other half later?",1470118715.0

I didn't feel sick while tripping, when I woke up I was in the dxm afterglow and had no WD symptoms which continued to the following day.

 Even then I didn't feel sick but used anyway because I had dope and wanted to see if my theory was right (dxm acts on k-opiod receptors I believe and would prevent any WD or urge to use which it did for me)

So me and my friend (we'll call her ReeRee) went downtown to grab some dope from my dealer who we will call D. I needed a ride and offered half of whatever I bought for the ride because she likes to get down too. Anyway I call my guy and he says he'll be ready in 30-45  minutes which is around the amount of time it takes us to get there so I have her come and pick me up. She arrives 15 minutes later so I figure by the time we get down there my guy will be ready (he is usually very punctual and the dope is top notch). 
So we're driving shooting the shit and when we reach his exit off the highway I give him a call. He proceeds to tell me he's gonna need another 20 minutes until he is ready. Me and ReeRee both roll our eyes and acccept the fact we're going to have to wait a little longer. So we're driving around the hood playing pokemon go and manage to catch a charmander and one of those shitty little bat things that are a bitch to catch, so that was cool. 20 minutes go by and I give him a call and he says to meet him at this gas station near his place and  that he will be there in 5 minutes. We arrive at the gas station and 5 minutes go by and he's nowhere to be seen. 
For a mental image we're parked with our backs to the store and front facing the entrance to the parking lot. 10 minutes go by and we call him and he says he'll be there in 5 minutes man. ReeRee is visibly  irritated as am I. So this is where it gets interesting. 5 minutes go by and a brand spanking new lincoln navigator rolls up. D uses rentals so it's impossible for me to know exactly what kind of car he is in. Right when the navigator pulls up it stops infront of us and the passenger rolls down his window and says follow me and motions his hand. Me and Ree are excited we can finally get dope so we follow him. We drive down a few blocks and he pulls over on an empty street with nobody in sight. Ree and me pull out our cash and I walk up to the window, excited and happy we can finally get high. I walk up to the car and look inside and theres a driver and passenger and they both have bags filled with beans on their lap and another bag with some good looking bud however to my surprise neither guy is my dude. I asked them hey man wheres D? They looked at me and said, oh man D sent us what you got? At this point im confused but they had the dope and ended up giving me TWICE what I should of got and in one of the bags they handed me had a piece of paper. I asked what the paper is and I they say its their number and to give them a call anytime. Im very confused but I walk away with my loot and they yelled out ""gimme a call anytime bro"" and left. So i get back in the car and tell Ree what happened and she was confused as well. Anyway we pull into a different abandoned lot and as we're fixing up a shot I get a call from D. I told D what happened and he said that he never sent anyone and that those guys had just seen me, figured I was waiting on a dealer and they swooped in and seized the opportunity. So I tell D the situation and he is pissed on the phone and I tell him how sorry I am and then I proceed to tell him that they dope they gave me was fake (actually it was real and fire). D tells me to roll up to his crib and he'll take care of me. Well I drove to D's spot and me and ReeRee explained the situation and he gives me  5 free beans after i got a tongue lashing about how to never believe  anyone unless I see his face. So at the end of all this me and ReeRee ended up getting 3 times the amount we pay for and I got a new dealers number.  LMAO what a trip. 
TLDR: Go to hood to cop from my guy and two random dealers sold me their product by tricking me into thinking my dealer sent them and I end up with 3 times what I paid for and a new dealer. ",1470110729.0

Found my diary from my junky days. Just one of many crazy stories. Let me know if you want some more stories or if it's shit . 

Decided to skip Don's Kerouac and the Beats class felling I’ve suffered enough dirty looks this year, pretentious grad students always forget they came from somewhere. Met Amanda on the corner of Trop and Eastern. She had picked up a 20 for us to split but we needed to make a quick trip to white cross drugs on the strip for rigs. At this time I was still living with my parents, just out of rehab, so I used when I could but not nearly everyday or week for that matter. She cooked it up for us in a McDonalds parking lot and fixed first as I watched then she did me. Amanda was a homeless girl from the desert and it showed. I could see beauty through all the suffering but it wasn’t around much after that. While she was pregnant she couldn’t stop using jeopardizing the life her kid was to fall blindly into. Already sick and tortured, eventually born with collapsed blood vessels and a heart that could barely beat. I saw she wanted out but didn’t know anything else. Our lips touched. She smiled gaps of chipped teeth, so innocent and engaged. People just need attention. I jumped back as I realized what I was doing and collected myself.
“I’m going to get a drink.”
I left her in my car and as I stood up to walk inside McDonalds the blood shot to my brain. Try and maintain…I had never felt it this intense and through the door I went.Make this quick. Straight to the register, cash in hand. 
“Can I have a medium……….
And then there was nothing.
I was nothing. No past or future. No name to call my own or family to grieve. Nothing lost. It could of been days or seconds.
My eyes opened to the yellow crusted roof of McDonalds. I was surrounded by faces I didn’t know and couldn’t move. Paramedics had me tied down. Just like you remember life before birth. I was reborn out of nothing into the statistic I would soon become. They took me away and I called out of work. First lying about using drugs then finally deciding to give up and see if they’d let me go. Suddenly the nothing turned to black. Escapism turned to problems that couldn’t be solved. My parents would have to find out about a version of this, having been on there insurance. Laying in the hospital I could over hear the lady next to me as the nurse gave her morphine for the first time. She was on cloud nine and all I could think was how I could get it from her. Life slowing becoming concrete. This is what you chose. When I was finally let out I ran back to my car which was surprising that it was still there. My coins in my ashtray had been taken but I understood. I developed a lie that I was anemic and told everyone. Living this life that never really seemed mine. Making stories up to fill the gaps. That night I got Xanax from my old English teacher and did more opiates. Wasn’t long before I was shooting again but the difference was I made it through these times. I’d be better off if it would just kill me. Instead it kills my time, money, friendships, relationships, work and my motivation to be me. The funny thing is no matter how hard something hits me I can never take a hint. I just want a little more. One more day I promise….",1470109651.0

Plugging.

My plan was to take one of the 2mg pills (first time, may do 4mg. Have yet to decide.). Crush it up very fine and then dissolve it in warm water. Then I would take my homemade re-usable enema (A squeeze bottle, with a long tube at the end). And insert it about 5"" in, then push the solution into me.

well as most people probably figured i tried them anyway. i sent the dealer a message and he assured me that he presses these pills himself, and that he does it accurately with industrial-grade machinery (yeah, i know, still probably should not have trusted him). i also hit up some other people i found in random reddit posts that seemed to have found the same batch.  

one guy seemed to know what he was talking about (told me that they seemed very ""homogenous"" to him) and had a novel idea for someone like me who doesn't have a high opiate tolerance: crush one up, take a tooth pick, dab the end of the toothpick on your tongue, and get some of the powder and put on your tongue. wait 25 minutes and repeat until feeling it.  so thats what i did, and now realize that i can take 1/4th of a pill but i havent gone any higher than that.  

one difference i notice is that these pills seem more sedative than euphoric, if that makes any sense?  these things straight put me to sleep rather than having that feel good feeling (hard to describe, i mean you still feel good off these things but not the upper-like euphoric feeling).  maybe thats just how fent feels?  not sure i am going to keep doing these things (ive done 4 quarter-pills over the last couple days) because of the difference between them and real oxycodone.  if anyone has any similar experiences with it, id be interested in hearing.  

anyway, thought i would post an update in case anyone else gets their hands on these blue A-215 replicas.    ",1470095699.0

Fast forward, I have relapsed on and off, mostly with kratom extracts and U-47700.  I'm now on about 300-400mg of U-47700 a day and called the clinic that does subs and methadone and they told me if my habit is ""too large"" then methadone would be a better fit.  

The problem is I travel a lot for work and other family reasons and can no way afford to go daily b/c of this schedule.  I'd like to get on subs but I'm afraid the doctor will see U-47700 and know nothing about it and say ok, 300mg x 7.5 = your equivalent dose in morphine and immediately put me on methadone.  Whereas I know the bioavailability is way lower.  And subs are 40x stronger than morphine with a 40% BA, that's 16x stronger.  So 16mg of subs is like constantly having 250mg of morphine in your system which I think would probably make me comfortable on 250mg of U-47700 a day.  I just think it's a crap shoot with the doctor knowing about it and giving me a chance to try.

I guess my question is, how big of a habit in H for example have you guys had subs help stave off WD almost completely?

Thank you much /r/opiates!!

I grew up with a veteran, chronic pain afflicted addict of a father who's DoC was opiates, which he always had in abundance. Now my parents have recently seperated due to his addiction, but all this is besides why I'm here. Im personally fascinated with psychology, drugs and addiction. Lately(past year) I've been obsessing with drugs in particular, learning all that I can about them and how/why people get addicted. Now that its summer and I have a lot of free time as a student I've moved on to experimenting first-hand instead of just reading wiki articles, r/opiates r/benzodiazepines and erowid reports. Partially this is because I had my wisdom teeth removed a month ago and got 20 (5mg) Vicodins as well as having migraines scripting me 60 Fiorcets(Barbiturate) a month. 

I've been using the Fioricet alot because I have so many and to be honest they're nice but minimally recreational on their own. The vicodin I had been saving since I only have a few and I know they're a guaranteed good time. I tried two by themselves and then three and both times they were nice but I only felt good for maybe an hour and a half. And by good I mean I felt content and a bit chatty but overall very mediocre. 

Then I tried 15mg Vicodin, 2 Fioricets and 25mg of Benadryl(learned it potentiates from this sub, thx). All I have to say is **wow**. It was amazing. I felt relaxed in my muscles but never in a burdensome way. I learned what euphoria feels like. I was sociable. My intrusive thoughts were there but they didn't matter, even when I exposed myself to my phobia of ticks. Yet I felt completely functional the whole time; I went for a two hour hike and close family members interacted with me without knowing a difference besides that maybe I was happy/talkative. 

Anyways it felt amazing and now I feel like I understand you guys, I understand my father and now no thought is scarier than the sheer amount of enjoyment that it brings. In fact I'd love to do it again ASAP and thats terrifying + humbling at the same time. I'll never break my internal rule of waiting at least 48 hours between trips, but this is the first time its taking willpower not to. 

I guess the thing I'm most elated about though is I understand now. I may not understand your pain; what it feels like to constantly be riding up and down between heaven and hell, or what its like to love and hate something with all the emotion humanly possible. But I do understand, or at the very least have had a small taste of, why you do it. Why you begin chasing dragons. How addiction happens. It feels really good to know, like a secret kept from me all my life that I've finally learned. I understand why my father would do anything to continue his addiction even if it meant destroying his relationships. I don't know what I'm going to do with this knowledge but my short term plan is to enjoy whats left of my Vicodin and quit while I'm ahead.

Sorry if this is dramatic but I love this sub and its community, its so compassionate and educational. Thank you for all you've taught me <3",1470089714.0

Im not sure if this is the right sub to post this, but i really need some help and thought this might be the right place. I assume some of you have experience in trying to get off opiates so i am hoping to get some advice.

Im abusing oxycodone for about 8 months now and for the last 3, 4  months or so on a daily base. The amount varies from about 25 (on a good day) to 35/40mg. Tried too go cold turkey but i wasnt handeling the withdrawls too well. It was affecting work and sports in negative way. Right now the abuse itself is  starting to affect my daily life. The only thing that kept me healthy (sports) is getting more difficult to do. I try to stay sober untill after training but the withdraw symptomes make me not want to train because i feel sick and not focussed. Same goes for work.

My question is if somebody has tapered using temgesic,loperamide and/or kratom and has something like a taper schedule. I have a fair amount of temgesic in my possesion because i read somewhere people used it for tapering of opiates. Also loperamide and kratom is easy for me to come by.

I got a ""scholarship"" to go to rehab because the owner believes in me and wants me to do well... I got 3 days into a cold turkey detox but I'm a musician and I had 2 out of town shows this weekend which would not only require me to perform but also fly around the country... I definitely couldn't handle being in full blown withdrawal for this... They were really nice and understanding about the situation and allowed me to go play the shows and come back to finish treatment so long as I took the suboxone prescription I have at my house... Well, when I went home to pack and get my meds for the trip, of course I did what any true junkie would do and stopped by my dboy on the way and got high... I considered actually taking the subs afterwards but decided fuck it and copped enough to use through the weekend... Pulled another junkie move and used my stash up way faster than I planned on... I had to fly back home dopesick af... I decided that I was going to get well one last time before I submitted to paying the piper and detoxing... The rehab was supposed to pick me up straight from the airport so I wouldn't be tempted to stop home and use before I went back in to treatment... I called them and told them I missed my flight and would now be arriving on Monday(today) instead... I actually landed last night at 10pm and have been shooting speedballs since... I have two more rigs loaded and they're stashed discreetly in my crotch... I just want to get settled in again and relax after my trip before I go down the roller coaster... I feel like a piece of shit for all of my deception... These people are trying to help me save my life and I'm doing everything in my power to cheat the system... All of this just to get high ""one more time""... My therapist told me he thinks I'm afraid of living up to my true potential and sabotaging my own greatness... I guess I agree... I think I subconsciously continue being an addict to use as a crutch incase I fail, I'll have something to blame instead of actually just possibly failing and living with the results... I'm so fuckin grateful to have a free trip to rehab... I can't wait to break the vicious cycle I'm stuck in... I can't wait to not revolve my every waking moment around my next fix... I can't wait to be free and not a slave to a chemical... This detox is gonna be hell but I will make it through to the other side... I will beat this addiction...

Abso-fucking-lutely not worth it. More inside.,"Ive been back in my hometown after going to rehab and moving to two different states 7 months ago. My hometown is known as a big dope city and i'd been clean 7 months but it all it took was passing by an old motel i used to pick up and get high at to get on the phone and call up an old dude i used to run with cuz my main guy wouldn't answer his phone.

so he gets to me real quick in like 5 minutes, i buy .25 from him and i excitedly rush over to walgreens thinking ""i havent used in like half a year, this is gonna be sick, ima get blitzed and pay like no money at all for it and im just gonna smoke it!"". Before i went to rehab i was banging dope everyday so i knew that was a promise i wasn't gonna keep to myself tho lol. Anyways i get to my car put the dope on the foil and take a few hits. nothing except a little head buzz and a sour taste in my mouth. fuck this blows. So i take a huge hit and exhale and as soon as the smoke leaves my mouth a little stream of puke does too. Lands on the foil too. 

Fuck right? so now im dashing back over to walgreens, i buy a 10 pack of 29g 1/2"" tips and then i drive to a grocery store where i used to get high a lot. I cook up in the bathroom and blast off and it feels great for a fleeting moment. I flush anything illegal and walk out the bathroom. here's where i fuck up. I still had the rig in my pocket and i grabbed a soup cup and a lid from the cafe on my way out because i always like to throw em away in some kind of container. Im literally 10 feet away from the trash and thats when i hear ""hey buddy, stop"". i keep walking and he quickens his pace and i turn around and its the manager. I'm like hey man whats the problem. He's like, ""show me whats in that soup cup"". I lie and say its just a cup so i can put food in it for my dog. He says prove it. At that point i want out of there so i shake it and say ""look i'm leaving right now"" and he says ""yea don't come back"". I guess thats what i get for trying to get rid of points safely?? lol

So now i'm decently high and i walk over to a mcdonalds and as soon as i get in the door i am absolutely overwhelmed by nausea and my clothes feel like i ran through a farm sprinkler. I am so hot and outta breath that i take all my clothes off and puke like 5 or 6 times in the toilet and just lay on the floor for a good five minutes or so. Eventually i gathered my shit and left and went back to my car and nodded out for a solid hour. Snapped out of the nod, threw the rest of the points away, smoked a joint and called up my boy who's clean and chilled him the rest of the night.

Anyone have experience?,"Long time forum reader. Created a throw away to post here. I know it sounds cliche but I feel like r/opiates is my ""tribe"".

I had surgery Spring, 2012 which is what started my love of opiates. I've been prescribed oxycodone for back pain (unrelated to the surgery). I have an acetaminophen allergy, and because of stomach issues I can't do ibuprofen. 

My primary care doc has been prescribing them to me for back pain and over the last few years I've built up to 60 of the 5mg every month. He has added in 60 of 15 mg oxycontin the last couple of months but has also said that he would like me to see the pain specialist starting soon to help manage the narcotics. I'm a little worried about it and have a couple of questions.

1) I occasionally use marijuana edibles. Will the pain management doc automatically test for it? I live in a State where pot is 100% illegal. I get it from a friend who lives in a State where it is 100% legal. I've made an appointment with the pain clinic doc for the end of August and I last used the middle of July. Will it be out of my system by then? Is there a way to speed up the elimination?

2) Can the tests the pain docs do tell them I am not taking the opiates daily? I save them and use them on the weekends. 

3) What's the best way to break down the OC to make them IR? I've read about letting them sit in coke. Does it have to be ""coke"" or would some other soda work just as well? What about letting them sit in coffee?

I had no idea what happened so I just drove to work. I called him the next and he said his reasoning for leaving is because he didn't want to get arrested, and he used that same excuse for stealing my dope. He did not admit to stealing my phone. Honestly, I don't even think he called 911. He said he did, but I don't think it would have taken them 30 mins to arrive.

I sat in the living room at my grandparents house. My father and mother as well as my brother were down visiting. My grandma was in the middle of talking about her friend from work while the phone rang. My mom answered.
“Hey Mare”
My aunt Mary lived next door and her daughter was in the back room of my grandparents house.
I looked up as my mom turned pale and her eyes penetrated my heart as it sunk deep into bottomless nothing. I jump up and ran to the kitchen. Throwing down the phone she follows.
“Give me the fucking pills”
    “I don’t know what your talking about”
Her arms wrap around my torso and I pry her off. I open the back door to the kitchen and run. My heart pounds as every step I take makes me feel closer to nothing, only postponing what will happen. Jonny bursts out of the front door and I keep running all the way down the block. My grandparents view from the window but I can’t look. I seem far enough away and I reach in my pocket and pull out its contents and swallow. When I look up I’m surrounded. My brothers roommate, Bladen, who’s house I happen to be standing in front of now , is in front of me as my mom and brother follow up the rear.  Bladen tackles me to the ground and in a matter of seconds and I’m searched all over and brought home in aggressive tugs to my arm. I’m living shit. My home at the time is a guest room with my parents. I sat in that room that night in denial that I even took anything while my trendy teenage escapism turned me deep into Allen Ginsberg’s Howl. Which I read over and over. Trying to hide the tears. 
-Five years drag me down-
Knowing my Grandpa had seen me run down the street being chased made me hurt the most. The endless days of monopoly when id catch him trying to cheat. Stories of childhood when danger and mischief was brought on by adventure. The birth of a hard headed Swede who taught me you can’t avoid getting hit but instead deal with the punches. His mid-life was full of late night cocktail parties, cigars and women. Became his own man. Cashing in on the last bit of the American Dream before it cashed him out. My earliest memories are in the back seat of his thunderbird cruising down the wavy hills in the San Fernando valley, leather seats with the cherry pipe tobacco imbedded deep in the seems. I must have only been 4 or 5. Frank Sinatra’s South of the Border played as my brother and I did the best we could singing along and trying to not crack up at the “we were so gay” line. Still to this day that smell brings me back. When my grandparents moved from LA out to Vegas I was ten years old and had lots of time to learn from the man. I can’t go a day without using something he told me. I was his little side kick. We found a dog when I was in the fifth grade and my parents wouldn’t let me keep him but it was my grandpa that said I could keep him at his place and I could visit whenever. When I was 14 he bought my brother and I paintball guns for Christmas after my father forbid it. He always spoiled us and I was hoping for someday to repay the favor. The change in me happened when I was 16. I used to come down once ever other month to mow grandpas lawn for him. He wouldn’t pay me but I liked to hang out with him. Sometimes he’d make me virgin old fashions and I’d drink with him as he’d tell me how much a steak used to cost or how you can make a zip gun. Soon I started to show up more often. From once a month to once a week to once every other day to mow his lawn. I’m sure he had caught on long before I realized he did but maybe he just wanted my company and that hurts a whole lot more. There is no right way to pilfer, that is there is no good way. My grandpa was prescribed 10 mg Hydrocodone. He was suppose to take 3 a day but maybe do that much in a week. There fridge being in the garage made it easy for me to gain access. 
“ Do you mind if I grab a Brisk!”

Before he would be able to answer id have 5 or 6 in my hands and quickly down my throat. My logic was if he wasn’t going to take them, no harm done. Well besides one day when he tried to kill himself with a handful of them. It was just one of those stepping stone moments. He stuck around through for a lot longer. They ended up moving from the house my parents bought them in fear that my dad won’t support his brother when they die to one down the street, the one I ran from. Later on I cleaned up and visited but not nearly as often. I went to Alaska to work as a deck hand when I was 21 and when I got back his mind started to go. 4 years of a gradual decline into painful forgetfulness. He was always so quick witted. Life takes its toll on us all but he seemed bored and ready to go. He forgot my name long ago but towards the end I started to forget the man he once was. I got a few jobs and grew up, went back to Alaska for a second time and graduated but grandpa was too sick to attend. I was in bed with my girl friend this last year sick as a dog. Flushed with sweat and eyes glass with tears. My phone blew up. 

“Grandpas dead billy! Go down there”

My heart sank and I woke my girlfriend up and told her she had to go. Once she leaves I pull out my kit. I cook as quick as possible. Images of my grandpa dead on the floor flash as I spark the lighter. I remember my veins are all shot and this needs to be done quick. I soak up my shot and try my left hand. Squeezing it I’m reminded of the baseball glove he got me as a kid, breaking it in with shaving cream and rubber bands as the belt snaps around my wrist. Clock is ticking and I keep missing. This isn’t worth it but I’m too far in. I start to cry. Just as I was just about to give up old blue eyes came on the tv. Some shitty commercial for Sinatra’s greatest hits and I pulled the plunger back and a big red cloud shot up right as the trombone intro swayed into my ears. I slam it down “South of the Boarder, down Mexico way…” Thanks grandpa. Sorry. I thought as I threw rig away- Tv off - keys- wallet. Phone mom but they are already at the hospital. Drive 95 down Boulder but it’s too late. My hands look like mittens. I spend the rest of my grieving with my family. A few days later we have the funeral and less the 20 people show. That must be the problem when you outlive all your friends. When I was finally alone with grandpa I kneeled down to him and one of my tears landed on his cheek. I was expecting for him to jump out any minute  like it was a joke but it never happened.
“I’m sorry grandpa. I’m sorry I was late. These last few years have been hard and I hate to be the disappointment all the time. You’ve been there for me. I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you. Please forgive me.”
I slid I cigar I brought from home in his front pocket. The playlist switched over to South of the Boarder and my hairs on my neck became sharp. That was the last I talked to him. Randy Johnson, childhood friend of my Dad, who are no longer friends showed up for the briefest of moments during the end of the reception. I watched him hand my aunt a stack of cash in exchange for some pills. Maybe I’m a hypocrite but I never want to see him again. I was going to tell him to fuck off but by the time he got the pills he was gone.",1470185410.0

 I was thinking, since hardest part of WD/taper for me is lack of energy and boredom, that I could use low dose (15mg-30mg) orally of meth or amp for energy throughout my day and hopefully eliminate the need to redose throughout the day. Now I know meth is considered very dangerous but at this low a dose, plus light at the end of that tunnel to get me off oxy...I need this to work. I feel like I barely get euphoria anymore from oxy, mostly just to keep WD and boredom at bay and watching my accts drain before my eyes while my fiance tearfully asks why...I truly want to turn this ship around. 

I should say I got the idea originally because mid WD about 2 years ago when my habit was closer to 5-6 10mg pills a day, feeling like shit but bearable, I decided to dip a finger tip into MDMA bag and ate it.

Every day I would give him his medicine as he lay in bed unable to move. After awhile I had a headache and asked him for something. He gave me a half a Dilaudid so I initially had 2 mgs of Hydromorphones orally, not too much right? I proceeded to go about my business and was absolutely shocked. Within 10 minutes it was like I just felt so good, not too blitzed or anything just a very tranquil feeling. Like nothing is wrong in this world. In High school you could say I was popular. Smoked weed, held parties, delved into cocaine.. All that good stuff. At right about 11th grade my friend wanted to buy some pills off me as he was going on a trip. I was skeptical at first but then thought, ah what the hell its only like 3 from each bottle. After I did this a couple times.. And I'll never forget this. He said ""Dude are you crazy? If I had the access you have to pills, I wouldn't sell them I would do them!!"" I thought to myself and had a quick psychological rebuttal without uttering anything aloud. I thought, maybe he's right. Maybe I could do a couple here and there and be fine.. I think I will! 

Months later

Dad finds his pill bottle with only 2 pills left (Hydromorphones) always liked those more than morphine especially because the short half life and the bioavailability of the snort.. anyways. So he always normally shook his bottle before taking anything, just a habit eh? He shook and with disbelief, almost immediately realizing what was in store for him, just shrieked. Keep in mind my dads a doctor and a lawyer from Harvard so interrogations do not go well for me, although I do consider myself to be intelligent. He said, ""DONT YOU KNOW IM GOING TO GO THROUGH WITHDRAWAL NOW?? What have you done?!"" He proceeded to run a hot bath to soothe the symptoms. I would not know how he felt until just two weeks ago.

After having the life.. Making 500 a day, not doing shit. Pills every day, orange 40s, delivery at my fucking front door.. How CONVENIENT! It was hard to say no; let alone just say no and face reality. I couldn't do anything without pills. Even nearer to the edge I would be so sick - dry heaving.. Then I hear the doorbell!! Come on in bro. Blah blah blah ok here's the money -exchange- cya!

*breaks down pill.. instantaneously*

I would snort about half and some would go down my throat and I would absolutely have to throw up again. Even psychologically knowing I was gonna be okay in about 5-10 mins, I couldn't control the symptoms. It was literally the worst. And now after being off of opana for 2 weeks.. I feel so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so SO SO SO much better. 

If I can make the step from almost 300mg a day of intranasal oxymorphone to nothing, I think you guys can do it too!!!!",1470157159.0

What the fuck is the purpose of opium's existence. Was that just a natural coincidence that as humans we found this plant that can so profoundly affect our beings to our deepest core? Who's little molecules can both allow to to spend heaven on earth and make you wish you were dead?

Why do the things most pleasurable have to come with that spike of pain. Is it what lends the pleasure end its specialness? If opiates caused no overdose and no withdrawal would we all just be high as fuck every possible minute? Would the non-existent dangers deprive the drug of its luster after some time? I know at first I'd have a hell of a one week binge, but then what? Would I continue? Would you? 


Why do our brains feel the need to ""adapt"" and ""compensate"" for such rushes of euphoria? Goddamn you, can't you just leave the amount of opiates receptors you got alone and let the pleasure keep on coming? Shit, my brain doesn't build a tolerance to hot women and give me less and less pleasure the more of them I see and then make my whole body a living shithole when after looking to long at hot girls I don't happen to see one for a day or two.

The mixed responses and my own anxiety made me too scared to take the plunge. In my attempt to pursue a ""normal"" life I since got plastic surgery that has left me brain damaged. Not just slower but with a cruel permanent anhedonia so I can no longer experience any happiness from life at all.

I took 10mg of oxycodone for the first time and felt almost normal .. but I could still tell something was off. Like part of my brain was still out there not feeling anything. But I instantly realized I was a fool for not taking that chance when I still had my full brain. To think I could have actually experienced what true bliss is like and then make that feeling my entire life... fuck.  I had no social connections, and worked and lived by myself with a solid passive income, and never once had experienced true happiness (Still haven't - the one codeine pill I took remains the happiest I've ever felt). Opiates would have been a gift from God for me. Instead I'm cashing out my bitcoins now to go buy a gun.

I think maybe this sub does a disservice to those who are truly downtrodden to downplay the incredible benefits of opiates compared to the risks. Most people on here don't seem to be miserable. I think if I had at least gotten to experience that fabled first nod, I would never have resorted to something as stupid as plastic surgery to make me happy. Or at least I could go out with less regret for never having fully experienced life. Now it looks like my brain is too messed up to do that. ",1470155778.0

What do you fellas do as far as timing it? Do you do a line of each at the same time?

Well I found out yesterday through his cousin that my dealer (the middle man) got popped and is in jail. I have terrible anxiety issues (hence why I use) and my mind is all over the place. 

I know for damn sure there are texts on his phone of us talking about deals. No actual words are used I'd just say things like ""Hey going to [town next to ours] today?"" He'd say ""Yeah how much?"" and I'd say a number amount. 

I've always heard cops/police want to go ""up the tree, not down"" but I am just worried because after all the searching I've done on this question it's ALWAYS talking about grass and I am most certainly not talking about grass. 

Also I don't know shit about the law, he might start ratting people out to lessen his sentence. Is some texts and him saying so enough for a warrant?

Thing is, even if the cops did bust in here they wouldn't find anything but some pipes and grass (that belong to my husband) but that would still lead to an arrest. Because I can't find any to buy so I haven't been using since he's been away (blessing in disguise I suppose)

He got arrested on July 20th, if they were gonna do something to me would they have done it by now? Or would it be after some sort of trial or something?

Please Help,"So I knew I shouldn't. I've made the mistake before and lost everything to a small triangular pill. Multiples Times. 4 Years longest clean time. So I have the tool/support and know it's time clean again.

I don't want this to take everything from me again. I don't want to give it all away again. I work to damn hard to get to where I'm at today.

So I wanted to get high (not gonna BS ya) made one phone call and in 45 minutes had 2 pills.

It would only be two pills. Ill break them up and get high when my family and little brother aren't around and none will be the wiser.

As soon as those 2 are gone I get more. Don't even think about. I just do it. These pills will be the last then since I've only been using for a week so the WDs wont be bad and I've been through way worse WD due to much longer habits. And off to buy some more pills...

So I have 4.5 8 mg D's Left.  Some days if I'm busy I can get thru using two shots per day, buy as you now the legs are short on Ds. The most I shoot is 3 time a day, but its rare and I try to stick with 2.

I either IV 4mg twice a day leaving me with 4.5 days of this BS. It might be a little less than 4.5 days because sometimes I like the 6 mg shot and that would bring my count down.

Or the Hardcore end is I IV 6mg shots over 3 days and make that last 2 more days, of course my twisted bran will do some 4mg shots to conserve and the number might be closer to 3 days more on this shit. I have the tools I have the support, and hopefully I've made my situation clear.

Now the question I have is someone gifted me 9 10mg methadones. How should I effectively use these while making the WD the easiest.

Maybe I Won't need all 9? Do I take 1 a day for a few days then just stop the methdadone? Or do I do like a minitaper. 

Day 1 30mg
Day2  25mg
Day3  20mg
Day4  10mg
Day5  5mg
Day6  2.5mg

Or because I've only been using for about 3 weeks now do I do a faster Methadone taper?

My goal is to get off these pills ASAP, but would like to be somewhat comfortable(hence me getting some methadone)

Please Help I throw the best answer some Gold b/c I just mainly and unfamiliar with methadone. I'm just thinking if I'm taking any where between 8-16mg IV 2 to three times a week, whats the best bet with the methadone. I was thinking bc 12-16mg D daily is alot will taking 1 10mg pill even help?

themselves
the ditch you dug now leads to china 
still going
my body LIE dead in the shower stall
to fix what I destroyed long ago

IV League inbound

2.The world smells like compressed cologne

This cart is home too;
My upbringing, forging tickets with a beta aggression

This Car is home too;
Trashcans seeping of countless bums; the passion for crashing into things
No turning back

This phone is home too;
“come out and play”
I never reply

This house was home too;
bath salts, Go Fast and BLACK, my celling has changed color since

My hands are home too;
Synthetic paper and Popov
The scar above my left middle finger to remind me when I was wrong
Scars on my right hand knuckle to remind me I was right

My body is home to me and I’m sorry.
That night I left you sick in the desert after too much Xanax-
-My teenage waste driving hard
That day I OD’d at the McDonalds on Maryland. (I fell hard but I didn’t feel a thing)
That day I forgot to say I love you in your “precious text messages”
And that night I finally killed you off

My life is a home to me;

No more religious missionaries or shooting gallery
I just sit alone and wonder what’s to come
And how I’ll let it affect me.

3. you me and heroin

alone I suffered 
scaring 
tumbled
the ebb and flow 
depression makes before it
sets
solidifying your life
junkie 
broken 
fixable
alone I climbed 
healing forced itself
pacing daily as I learned to manage
structure &
solitude 
clean 
but 
still broken till I found you
together we have bled 
died 
scars so deep they cover memories 
marching through life, the game 
Work->Drug->Work 
i watch your life fall apart 
an instant 
as mine surly follows before I realize
mad insane 
no longer broken
maybe one day We can change 
I made you sick 
my responsibility

I'm a long time lurker on this sub, I just never had the balls to post until now (fresh account too, it still has that new account smell). I love the community here and you guys are the most accepting people ever. You guys make me smile when I'm down, make my problems seem more normal and you just make me feel like life is worth living when I want nothing more than to bury myself and give up on life. 
Anyways, some background info. I've been using opiates on and off for the past 5 years. I've smoked opium hash, took some percs, thought I could handle heroin and did too much when I was really young and dumb, managed to quit thanks to my gf at the time (I didn't tell her about my use but it was nice having someone care about you). I was clean for awhile, got dumped and went right back to where I started. I quit again and told myself that I'd only stick to pills, and only freebies. I managed to stick to those rules for a year, until I got a bunch of 10mg vicodins from my friend's surgery. Needless to say those rules went right out the window as soon as the pills were done. I now have a connect that has 4mg dilaudids and I'm back to almost daily usage. They give me some pretty bad insomnia though (I'll go to bed at 2-3am, and fall asleep at 7-8am if not later), so I'm just wondering if there are any ways to get rid of the insomnia, or should I switch to something else?",1470255668.0

Be a friend to? Level with? I don't know...handle, maybe...a friend who is lost to his addiction? I am DESPERATE for an answer to this.
 My group of friends that was once a solid, thriving family of like-minded pot smoking, festival hopping, traveling, music chasing ""hippies"" is dwindling. Half of us just had to cut back, due to new careers, babies, probation even. But more so than that, we are losing our buddies to H. 2 have OD'd and died in the last year. A few are new users and have, in a matter of weeks, dropped off the face of the earth. 1 has been in and out of hospitals, rehabs, and halfway houses for going on 5 years now. He, in particular, is who keeps me up at night, wrecked over whether or not I will wake up to hear that he is gone. He comes back to us begging for friendship and love, and we always welcome him back with open arms, and he is okay for a week or 2. We use to continue to smoke him up, as he said being stoned distracted him from his incessant craving for dope. But that's always when he would start to spiral again. A week later, money would go missing, along with game consoles, glass pieces, etc. He would disappear, and we'd hear from the grapevine he was heavy back at it. So next time around, no pot around him, but we never gave up. Now it is to a point where he almost resents us for wanting to help. 
It's not an option to leave him alone about it. This kid, he was one of the good ones. Kindest, sweetest soul I have ever met. Would give you the shirt off his back, bend over backwards to help a friend out. Big into his church, awesome musician, so so so smart. And now all that's left is the shell of that person. And I want him back. I am not satisfied with the answer ""that's just who he is"" because it's not. He is not the junkie that we see now. He is beautiful, and this drug has almost destroyed him.

I've heard of high proof alcohol increasing the sublingual BA, so today i took 4mg klonopin (I always try to potentiate in some way, whether it be cimtimine (tagament) or dph) and then took a small swig of whiskey and held it under my tounge for about 5 minutes.

Then i swallowed it and placed half of a 8.6/2.1 Zubslov tablet under my tongue and am typing this as it dissolves.

Explanation inside (as well as a ""mystery fever"" bonus you might help me with). [high level shit post]","So, a bit of background (that I've written plenty of times in comments so some of you might find this redundant). Since roughly 2 months, I'm living and working with my uncle in a small town some ~3 hours from my hometown, Stockholm. He offered me this opportunity and I took it, having been basically homeless for two weeks previous to moving. I am really, really grateful of course, but, after only a few days here the cravings got unbearable.

I managed to buy some bitcoins and order half a gram, which I saw the last of 5 days later. So, another G. Which lasted barely a week that either. 

Now, the problem is, at this point my parents took complete charge of my account, partly because they thought it was tempting for me to have that much money, and partly because I was (am) in massive debt. I obliged them with the passcode and stuff, because I genuinely thought that I was done forever.

Having your parente have that much control over you when you're 25 sucks balls. I've been fiending like crazy this past month, but without money, haven't been able to score. However, I came up with a great idea.

Like two weeks ago I went to meet this girl from Tinder who is one town over. I spent the night (nope, didn't get laid but got to cuddle which is almost better. Fuck I miss cuddling. Fuck I miss my ex. Anyway) and came back home the next day. So I figured I'd just say I was going to spend the night with her, but insted go home TO STOCKHOLM AND DO DRUGS!!! Fucking genius. So that's what I did.

Came to Stockholm yesterday at roughly 11:30am. Immediately went and copped a ball from my old dealer. Then, after finally having gotten high for the first time in way too long, I ran some errands. Got some more cash, picked up more dope and a bit of coke to do speedballs. Only done a speedball once before and didn't use enough blow so I was underwhelmed. But this time - holy fucking ballsack was it good!

So I walked around doing speedballs all day, sat in a park for a while, had some beers and listened to podcasts. Then I went to my old favorite Indian place for some lamb, and later on went to a free stand-up club. Some of my favorite local comedians did their sets which was awesome.

I didn'thave anywhereto sleep so I just walked around high as tits, catching pokeymans and listening to Frank Ocean's Channel Orange in preparation for his (finally) upcoming album.

All in all I'd give these past 24h a 9/10. The only thing dragging it down was, because of my low tolerance, the itching has been extreme to the point of almost intolerable. Tried three different kinds of otc meds but nothing's worked. Also, my homeboy u/CloudRain313 was supposef to meet me there but ended up in the hospital after having seizures bc of trams, so a big shoutout to him and wishes for a speedy recovery!

(I've got mosquito bites on my psoriasis, and a severe opiate itch. I might claw my way down to the bone this time)

*Bonus: when I got home today, I felt alright and took a nap. When I woke up I had a crazy high fever, and still do even after 800mg of ibuprofen. I'm suspecting that it's due to my pump; I got plenty of supplies from a super friendly reddit user, but unfortunately the needled and filters didn't fit the pump. So I've been using an old pump that I've had since before I moved. Do you guys think that's the culprit as to why I'm having a fever? Like, how easy is it for bacteria to accumulate in an old rig, and if that is it, how do I wash it properly? Thanks.*

Like the title says, my first week of going to the local clinic is in the books. I went on my pwn terms, & wasn't forced to by anyone. Basically, I saw someone fallout last week, & that's where & when I drew the line. 

Everything there is going fantastic. I have a personal therapist, & I love my sessions with her. We talk about anything & everything, & this is a big deal for me.

Of course, I am on methadone, 50mg at the moment. The medicine is nice, but, I am convinced that the sessions with my therapists (single or group) are what's going to keep me off the streets.

I don't want to be on the methadone forever, & would eventually like to switch to sub.

Next session with therapist is Monday at 8am, & I also up my dose that day.

If you read this far, thanks. I am very optimistic about my treatment.

so recently it has come to my attention about a disease known as Leukoencephalopathy that seems to be primarily contracted from smoking heroin off foil or 'chasing the dragon'.

Does anyone have any knowledge about this or if it is still around? I've heard that chasing the dragon is the main ROA around the UK and i would think that if that ROA is so prevalent there then there would be a lot more information on the internet about it. So far I can only find sparse articles about it and interestingly cant find any recent articles about the disease past about 2002.

So far all i can find about it are a few articles stating its rare and from an adulterant that the heroin is cut with but they don't know what this adulterant is yet or why it is contracted just from smoking off of foil. Information is sparse, scattered and seems to contradict itself a lot, especially the wiki article saying that you can contract the disease from a number of drugs and no matter the ROA. 

Does anyone have any information/harm prevention tips regarding this? anyone have any personal stories or friends that have suffered from the particular disease? I've freaked myself out over it and would love to know if its something i should be worried about.
Thanks heaps",1470388645.0

Again, I have no idea why that would be the case though.

I'm pretty ignorant to all of this. Which I suppose Imm glad about since that, at least partially, means  I'be never been searched.

Like two in the morning. My dboy usually has me meet him in the city, but since it was late he agreed to meet me at a gas station right outside the city. It's closed at the time, but it's still better than my white ass posted on the block after midnight.

Still. I'm worried about sitting there for too long. He usually takes much longer to meet me if I'm not going into the city to meet him. Nothing crazy, but waiting 10-15 minutes at noon is cake. An empty parking lot at 2am is a different beast. All it takes is one curious cop to driven by and... 

So I hit him with the ""I'm about to pull in"" text when I'm still a few lights away. Hopefully he also realizes being posted there after hours isn't the best look.

I pull in, and as I'm getting ready to let him know I'm at the spot, a car pulls in right behind me. Shit you not, it was my Guy!! He comes up to my window, serves me 3.5 bundles, and that was that! Once I pull out of the gas station I'm sniffing bag after bag; I have made it through another day.

Not going to explain what got me there in the first place but when you live like this is almost feels like a lifestyle. Like, when I'm not being threatened or at risk of injury I feel almost bored. Like i feel an almost thrill for being put in danger now. It's odd. Does anyone else have this issue? Like almost the adrenaline maybe has made me enjoy being in life or death situations. 


On a side note, I'm out of the hospital. According to the doctors I have ""severe asthma"" now.. I didn't know you could developed it at an older age. Got me on a whole bunch of meds including a rescue inhaler now. Always been relatively healthy. Only occasionally maybe every other year getting sick. So having news like this is baffling. From healthy as a horse to wtf i can't breathe on my own. But I want to thank yoj all for the support and caring messages I received. You guys are all great I love you all.


On another side not I haven't had dope since last Friday night. The night before i went to the hospital. Luckily i had some meds and stuff to somewhat help with withdrawal during my stay in the hospital so I'm good and clean now.

(Long, depressing shitpost)","So,  today I essentially adopted a 23 year old junkie and his 7 month pregnant wife.  I agreed to help him with a semi-fast (6 week) suboxone taper, acquire (from my own pocket) the sub strips, provide him the counseling that a reputable sub clinic would do, to be available to his family for any questions they may have, and to do my best to help them access any programs that may make the next few years easier for them, and thus increase his odds of success. 

I've known these people for 2 days. So why agree to spend the time and money for people I barely know? Well, I was chilling at dboy's place today, enjoying my usual payday binge, when they came in. It came up that they had an appointment with her OB in a few hours, and I said I'd give them a ride there, since it was on my way home. We wound up getting there 20 minutes late because we left a full half hour after the agreed upon time, because he needed one more shot. Then needed to buy some shards. Then obviously he wanted to do a shot to test the shards. And so on. While he was ignoring the inexorable passage of time and the people reminding him of it, I looked over to his young wife. The mixture of anger, sadness, and embarrassment there was incredibly familiar to me, because I had been seeing it for a decade on my wife's face. 


I saw it the night we went to dinner with her parents, and her dad asked if she had 'kept me up all night' because I was nodding out. I saw it when she saw me sneak some hydros so I wouldn't be sick during the birth of our daughter. I saw it every time that we had to borrow money because we came up short for rent, or insurance, or Christmas/birthday gifts. I saw it as she found dozens of rigs, and listened to hundreds of lies. 


I didn't see that face yesterday,  though. I saw something worse. You see, I had gotten a bit of heatstroke at work, so when I got home, I fell asleep almost instantly. In fact, I fell asleep in the middle of sending a text and dropped my phone. When she picked it up, she saw the text was about drugs and decided to poke around. So she saw I was still shooting H, instead of eating the occasional percocet to deal with soreness from work. She saw the sexually charged conversations junkie ladies. She saw that my brother hadn't gone to the hospital for heatstroke like we had said, but because he fell out on the H I'd sold him. 


So instead of seeing that facial expression, what I saw first was all of the pictures of us piled in the floor, along with the letters I had written her and the other emotional nick-nacks you pick up over the course of a decade of being together. The next thing I saw was the love of my life, the mother of my daughter sobbing so intensely she could hardly draw in a breath. She asked me how I could tell so many lies to someone I loved. She asked me if I wanted to be with someone else, and told me to quit stringing her along if I did. And she asked me why I couldn't just be happy with my life, why I needed artificial happiness. 


There's no telling how many times I've made her cry, this poor girl whose only crime was loving me. I've been trying to get clean again, but sometimes I feel like it's too late for me. But I can help this couple avoid that. Maybe she won't have to shed so many tears, and he won't have to live with the same guilt that I'm carrying around. And if it doesn't take, if he won't stick with it, maybe she'll do what my wife probably should have done when she was pregnant, and take off before the kid will be able to be hurt by losing daddy. 


If anyone reading this is dabbling in opiates, or is early on in their addiction, please think hard about it. The high is like nothing else, but the joy is not free. You steal it from your own future, and from everyone that loves you.

Just wanted to say that i last used heroin on tuesday, drabk 40mg worth of loperamide wed, and now today i was starting to get sick again and i suptisingly found my old script of subutex i had gotten right before i went into heart surgery. I put it in a spoon and mixed 4mg of bupe in 45 ml of water, filtered through a new cotton 3x, and injected it. And...im actually pleasantly suprised at the rush i got. Nothing compared to heroin obvioudly, but i got that sedating, everything is okay, glow and slight boosy in mood/energy thst i normally get when i do heroin. Obviously i dont advocate abusing your script like this but when you need yo get high, you need to get high. Always practicr harm reduction guys!!

I haven't used subs since Thursday as of now. Will the clinic not take me with subs in my piss? Could I not use sub today (Saturday) if I had to? Can taking methadone after sub cause some sort of PWD? No, right? Only subs too soon after methadone would do that.

Edit: someone commented if I piss hot for benzos they won't take me, but they did not mention that on the phone. They just said don't use 24 hours before coming in.

This guy is a literal piece of human waste. Walking skeleton, smells like piss, DESTROYED arms. Can't even read. 

I just need to vent about this fuck face. 

Gets in the car and right off the bat complains about me not having water/cotton when he has always brought it. And I'm the one supply the car and the money. Like shit, you are just walking to your dude and getting the shit, fuck off. 

Then he puts his disgusting mud caked torn to hell shoes he always wears on the dash of my brand new car. WHAT THE FUCK. 

In the most obnoxious way possible, condescendingly snaps at me to get over into other lane, when to get over (and when I don't get over in .05 seconds of him telling me to he throws a bitch fit), etc. I proceed to tell to him to shut the fuck up, that he doesn't even know where we are going because he can't read the exits and that I have made this drive 1000 times. But no bro, he's been doing dope longer so he knows it better according to him. 

Picks up from the guy and then proceeds to spill like half the fucking dope on the ground when he gets in the car. And then STILL is trying to get me to split that shit with him. Like no. Should have thought of that before you just lost $60 fucker.

Is violently nodding on the way back, in the most annoying way. I have never seen anyone do this shit so I figured he had to be trying to be annoying as fuck at this point. He has his eyes closed and his bottom lip pulled over his top lip in pure, unadulterated down syndrome fashion, with his arms out in front like a t-rex, and is flailing around. Like come the fuck on. He then proceeds to mumble some shit to me over and over and I tell him I can't hear it. He gets pissed at this and starts screaming profanity. OK. 

So then I'm driving through McDonald's on the way back. As I'm making my order, HE SCREAMS AS LOUD AS HE CAN TO MAKE HIS ORDER OVER MINE IN THE DRIVE-THROUGH. Totally cuts me off. Then tells me thanks for paying. Like what the fuck? I didn't offer you anything and I'm not paying for shit dude. 

Pull up to the drive through window, and this is the icing on the cake, he essentially sexuslly harassed the woman working the window. Tells her she is sexy and he wants to fuck her in the ass and stuff. I have never seen someone look so uncomfortable. And trust me, if someone looking like this guy said that shit to you, you would to. Anyway, I apologize profusely and move on. 

Finally drop the motherfucker off and he's all smiles telling me thanks bro and to hit him up. Like no. I'm never hitting you up again you fucking brain dead nesnderthal. Damn. 

I've just noticed 80% of the time I use a middle or a select few of other users I know, they all act like this. 

Like why? Why do you act like a piece of trash? Inconsiderate, and really you are just embarassing yourself. Except they have no shame.

This time, let's get some discussion going about ROA's! What is your preferred Route of Administration? What was your first? Do you prefer different ROA's for different DOC's? And as an add on to all these questions, why? 

To clear some things up, here are various ways many opiates can be consumed (in no particular order):

Insufflation(snorting)- ingesting the substance through your nose, often by plugging one nostril and pulling air into the other. The substance is absorbed by the tissue in your nose. 

Intravenous Injection(IV)- injection into a vein (Bang that shit!). Shooting up, as it's often called, involves the injection of a substance directly into your veins. 

Inhalation(Smoking)- heating the substance, often through indirect means (vaporization) and inhaling the smoke/vapor that comes off of it into the lungs. Heroin users who smoke theirs on foil often call it ""chasing the dragon"", although this is slang. 

Orally- ingestion by swallowing your substance. Most commonly associated ROA with pills. 

Sublingual- dissolving your substance under the tongue to be absorbed by the tissue there. 

""Plugging""- I don't know the technical term for this. Ingestion of substance in the anus, by absorption via the anal canal. Often preferred by people who don't want to shoot up due to the typically high BA of substances in the asshole. 

Intramuscular Injection(IM)- injection of your substance into your muscle. Rather than be immediately in your blood stream like IV'ing, the substance is absorbed by the muscle. *Many missed IV shots are ingested like this*

Subcutaneous Injection(skin popping)- injection of your substance into/just below the skin. Rather than be immediately in your bloodstream like IV'ing, the substance is absorbed by tissue in your skin. *Many missed IV shots are ingested like this*

Topical- ingestion of a substance by absorption into the skin. This is commonly associated with patches (suboxone, fentanyl) that are worn on the skin. 

It's possible I missed some. Feel free to tell me about any in the comments. Also, thank you guys for the plentiful and interesting responses on the last one, some great answers and conversation there so please check it out. Happy nodding! ",1470463086.0

I'm also on methylphenidate prescribed for narcolepsy. In the past I always railed 2mg bupe a day to maintain away the WD/s and stockpiled the remaining 2mg/day, then I realised snorting the 2mg bupe with one of my methylphenidate doses amplified the stim buzz somewhat. 

A few months ago however I went back to snorting the whole 4mg in one go and realised, with or without the MPH this alone gave me a buzz. Not an opioid buzz. More like a slow, long-onset, light buzz where I infact feel more motivated to do stuff sometimes than I do on the MPH. I faff around, write long-winded posts about stuff on the internet, the furthest from your typical opioid buzz you could imagine.

Normally when I began to snort large doses of my stockpiled bupe in the past I'd build up a tolerance within a week and go back to doing 2mg/day as before cos doing 8mg felt no different. But I've been railing my daily 4mg dose, now, usually first thing in the morning, for a couple months. And tolerance hasn't changed. I still catch a pretty stimmy buzz from it.

Anyone else had similar experiences with bupe? My addiction keyworkers keep asking me when I plan to start reducing but as long as I'm getting a buzz from it, even if it only lasts about 2 hours or so, every day, then I have no desire to reduce (I haven't mentioned this to them though obviously).

I've also tried other RoA's. Plugging both small and large doses doesn't do anything. Same for sublingual. Just to clarify this isn't *caused* by any kind of cross-synergy with the methylphenidate cos I get the buzz whether I take it with the MPH or not (though I like to combine em from time to time cos they *do* in fact synergise quite nicely when I do).

tl;dr - been snorting my maintenance dose of bupe 4mg/day and getting high off it consistently for a few months.",1470444480.0

Sorry if it's common knowledge but I was interested in this info and thought others might be.  It will probably only interest people in PA. 

So PA's prescription monitoring program was pretty basic before. It was only for C-II and only Law Enforcement agencies had access I believe. There was supposed to be a new system put into place in June of 2015 but they didn't have the funding. It was started in late June of this year and will be fully live at the end of this month.  

I was looking through some info and some parts of it bothered me. It said that law enforcement needed a court order to access records regarding CIII-CV but this language was missing from the paragraph about CII scripts. So it seems it is easier for LE to access info for CII. 

I won't get into my privacy concerns any more.  I will just paste my query and their response for anyone that is interested.  Hopefully it's useful to someone. 

If anyone is familiar and has more info that'd be cool too!

-------------------------------

Hi, 
I noticed PA's prescription monitoring program is going into effect this month after being delayed from last year. I was hoping you could clear up a couple things for me. 

I have a question about Section 9 (b) (3) (i) of the 2014 Act 191. It states that The Office of Attorney General shall query the system on behalf of all law enforcement agencies. There are 2 paragraphs after that. Paragraph A addresses schedule 2 controlled substances and paragraph B addresses all other schedules. Paragraph B states that the system will be queried upon the receipt of a court order by the requesting LE agency. Paragraph A does not state that a court order is required. 

Can you tell me under what circumstances the system can be queried about a CII prescription? 
Is this saying that law enforcement can query this system about a CII prescription without a court order? 
The fact that law enforcement has access to this information at all is worrisome but if they are able to access information without a court order that is definitely a problem. 

Regarding paragraph B, am I understanding that law enforcement needs only 'reasonable suspicion' to obtain a court order to access a person's medical records? Isn't the standard for a warrant 'probable cause'? IF you are going to allow citizens privacy to be invaded, there should be a much higher bar than reasonable suspicion. Does this section comply with the 4th Amendment? 

Also how are you planning on informing patients of this new program? I would not have known this was going into effect if I did not remember last year and decide to see if there was any new news. Patients have a right to know about this new program, especially if law enforcement can access their medical information (even though they could with the old program already)


Thank you for your time

Hi padrugmonitor


The PA PDMP system will go into effect this month for dispensers where they will need to start submitting controlled substances dispensation data to the new PDMP system. The actual go-live for the prescribers and dispensers is still end of August.
 
1.  The system can be queried only by the Office of Attorney General (OAG). OAG’s office may query the system for its own purposes or at the request of other law enforcement agencies for Schedule II controlled substances without any court order. All other law enforcement agencies do not have direct access to the PDMP system but must make their requests through the OAG.

2.   For all other scheduled controlled substances, a court order is required. A court may enter an order if a law enforcement agency demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the request pertains to a person who is already the subject of an active criminal investigation with a reasonable likelihood of securing an arrest or prosecution in the foreseeable future; and that there is reasonable suspicion that a criminal act has already occurred. These terms along with the ones you stated, “probable cause” and “4th Amendment,” are criminal law terms that are beyond the scope of the answer here. No answer or opinion will be given.
 
3. A written notification will be sent out to all pharmacies, dispensers and prescribers to be used or displayed to provide notice and information about the PA Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to patients  A copy of those notices will also be posted on PA PDMP website. Patient’s rights and information will also be posted on the website shortly.

4.  There will be more updates via our public communications.

 
Hope this helps.",1470437349.0

I just want to ask this quickly and see what the general consensus is. 

The best opioid rushes I've ever had have been from the right amount of good dope, or dilaudid. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a junky at heart, and when it comes to overall high, nothing beats the opioids for the euphoria and good feels.

But when it comes to rush, I feel like dope has nothing on the right dose of cocaine IV. The rush from a good shot of cocaine is indescribable in it's euphoria, first the taste in the mouth, then the euphoria climbs higher and higher, until it's almost unbearable, taking your breath away and making you pant and almost puke. It feels about 1000 times better than an orgasm, and lasts a good few minutes. After that, the high isn't worth shit.

But that rush though!...does anyone find a strong dope rush to be anywhere near that of a good IV coke rush? I want to hear what all the dedicated dopefiends say.

My vote goes for coke for the best rush on earth, and dope for the best high on earth...",1470430522.0

I waited there there for hours

They dance from lack of sleep

The stench had hit me hard

 It singed my nostril hairs

I wait while weak and weary ,

Too tired for the stairs

Hours turned to days
 I wait there in the corner

Tried to think of ways

 But fog consumes me further

I'm fevered, sweaty, weak 

That box just will not come

I'm on a losing streak 

Just short of getting some.

Finally after months ,

The box has come for me

To relieve me of my slump 

Content is soon to be

The corner in the box

 Is worse  than than that upstairs

riddled with debauchery, 

I lean, too weak to care

After about a day

 The box has opened up

angry sun shines my way

 I think First time in months

THEN finally THERE HE IS!
 With heaven in his hand

THE beacon OF RELEIF! 

I've been waiting for my man

The exchange was brief and simple

 I barely remember it

I return to that vile box 

And happily I sit

Takes a couple minutes

 For me to reach my floor

Then a couple seconds 

To finally reach my door

Sweaty weak and weary

 With heaven in my hand

I push it in my body

 content I leave this land

Goodnight , goodbye , farewell. 

Good luck with all of it

I quit , it's over, I'm done.

Due to study/work/relationships and relocating we'd drifted apart over the last few years and had only been catching up once every few months.  I saw him today for the first time since the beginning of March.

He's now been using IV daily for over 2 months; His girlfriend of 3 years is gone, he's dropped out of college and is living alone selling dope and pills.

What I saw was unexplainable and breaks my heart. He weighs no more than 110lb and has sunken blackened eyes and grey skin. 

He shot up while I was there and proceeded to wander around cross eyed, confused, in and out of conversation and forgetting where he was. After 15 minutes or so he was fully under the impression that we were about to be on our way out and that i'd just handed him $200 to help me cop. I went to piss for a minute and came back to him slurring that he thought he was inside his dealers house and had forgotten that I was there.    (Are these hallucination/delusions typical with IV use?  I have no idea) 

He mentioned having briefly tried methadone and that he's reduced his use from 8+ times daily to now using two or 3.  I know he wants change.  


I'm still in shock but my initial thought is to see if he's interested to meet weekly for a coffee/meal etc somewhere public and close by.   I feel like for me to sit there in his house surrounded by syringes and smack isn't conducive to change.  I know he has no sober non-using friends.

Any suggestions or thoughts would be more than appreciated guys thank you already for having read this far. ",1470579996.0

I don't know if this is just a 'UK' thing, in regards to the violence aspect. But I do know that all directed stigma towards drug use is all aimed at Opiate users. 

This disgusts me. Out of all the drug 'circles' i've been involved in, Opiate users are by far, the kindest, compassionate and selfless people i've met in my entire life, and that's saying something.

That is the exact reason I love this sub-reddit. Everyone here has in some form or another, the values I just mentioned. Even among non-drug users, those values are hard to find.

But yeah, back on topic. Why do you guys & girls think that Opiate users always bear the brunt of drug related hatred? I love discussions, so hopefully lets get some opinions on what you think about this issue, because I do believe that it could get much worse for us. Opiates are by far not the most dangerous drug out there... Methamphetamine is much worse for ones body, and yet the stigma isn't as bad for them.

The seller is very well trusted and both him and the plentiful reviews state that it is very potent - with one advising insulating 1-5mg max for a new user - is this usual for 'pure' heroin.

I am aware of the prevalence of cutting with Fent so am appropriately worried, is there any was to test the H for Fent?

Edit 1: Should have mentioned that there was no reviews that claimed cutting with Fent for the China White. Also, please save the 'Best harm reduction is not to use to drug at all' etc - I would really just like some advise on dosage for pure Heroin.

For years, we put all of our recycling out for trash pick up, including bottles and cans. And every week, guys with shopping carts go up and down the street picking out the stuff they can turn in for cash. 

I finally thought fuck that. If anyone is going to make money off of my recycling, it's going to be me. 

Saved up a bunch of bags and went to the recycling center. Looked around and saw a mix of homeless guys, old Mexican ladies and junkies. 'Yep. I'm at the right place.'

Couldn't believe it when they finished weighing everything and the guy handed me like $40. 

Fast forward to me trying to scrape up enough money to buy a few xanny bars. $20 will get me 4. I remember I've got some stuff to take to recycling. Turn it in and get $10. Need another $10.

Go home and go through the fridge & cabinets to find stuff to return at the market. If you don't have a receipt and the dollar amount is less than $10, they'll usually give you cash. Otherwise it's store credit. But it depends on the cashier. Sometimes they'll give you store credit no matter the dollar amount.

My fiancé passed away from MRSA, even though they caught it very early. 




A woman who I loved, whom I dated for a year and 6 months died from MRSA. Refused to go to the hospital, she said she was terrified of what the doctors would think of her as a Junkie. When I was finally able to get her to go; it was already too late. Fever was 104 when we arrived. She lasted 3 days.




I never had the guts to call her parents. I had to fly to Vancouver, BC, to tell her parents face to face. As soon as I told them her dad jumped on me, beating my face with his fists. I didn't fight back; I only tried to cover my face. I felt as if I deserved it. When they flew back to see her body, I remember being with them at the hospital, visiting the morgue to see her body. 



At the hospital, I stayed in a waiting room, there was me, a gentlemen in his 50s and what looked to be 3 sisters. I sat there, staring ahead of me, at particularly nothing. My mind was blank; I didn’t know what to think about. I couldn’t think, because if I did, I would be sad. When Sam’s parents saw her lifeless body, I heard a scream. Not the typical scream. This horrendous sound, had emotion in it. I felt as if Wade, Samantha’s father, had just lost everything he had in his life. He had no other children, no grand children. 2 Months before this day, his wife Tina, Sam’s mom, had been diagnosed with stage II lung cancer. Tina died on July 4th, this year. 

Sam died August 15th, 2014th. 




The next incident occurred in 2009.




My older brothers name was Jared. He was an addict, just like how I am now. I pretty much followed in his footsteps, except for a few different choices that led me to different paths. On a late Sunday afternoon, my brother Jared was fighting with my mom. My mom accused him of taking some of her Lyrica. He was really angry, screaming back and forth with my mom. The fight died down and eventually it seemed she got over it. Fast forward two days later its Tuesday morning. My father finds my brothers body. Words can’t even describe what I felt in my heart. I was somewhat young and this killed my teenage heart. He had left a note stating the following: I didn’t take your pills. And in fact, he was correct. He didn’t take her pills, because I did. I was young, stupid and I didn’t want to get in trouble. You can guess how I felt afterwards. 


Everyday I wish I could go back in time and do things differently. Addiction is not a joke. I have been to more funerals than most of people my parents age have been to. Please do not think you are safe because you only take a lortab or two on the weekend. I started out the exact same way.

I just finished 1.25gr of U-47700 in a lapse of a week, yesterday being my last day in which I sniffed around 250mg through nasal solution.  Today I am our of U4. 

So I went to a pharmacy where I found a generic  Tramadol box to cost $159 pesos ($8 US) for 10x 50mg capsules. 

When I went to pay for two boxes and the price was slashed to $30 pesos per box ($1,57 US).  So I obvioulsy bought 6 boxes (60x 50mg capsules) for $180 pesos ($9.5US). 

[PIC RELATED](http://imgur.com/AUljcRK) 

I am most likely buying 10 more boxes tomorrow (the promo ends in September) before I leave the country. 

My actual question is:
How to tapper off U4 withdrawals with Tramadol? 

Today I just feel lethargic and have flu sympthoms, but am ok, my week of usage was regulated to only dosing after work around 60-100mg U4,  and my sober week mornings were always productive with a pinch (5mg) o 4F-MPH.

I do not feel dope sick, but do feel hungover. I already took 125ug of F-LAM to spend the day relaxed, but am missing the bliss. 

I am thinking about talking 200mg Tramadol today and then 100g Tramadol for 2 days and then 50mg Tramadol for the last 2 days.

I know there is no fool proof way other than testing it with a kit but that can be prohibitively expensive/inconvenient. 

So what are some pointers? I know typically that it has a strong rush, but no legs and past significantly shorter period of time than heroin. Also comes with more sedation. But that comes after injecting. I need to know beforehand. 

But what about taste, etc? I only ask because I bought some dope today that was white as snow. When you taste it, it does not have much of that bitter taste you expect from heroin either. Not much vinegar smell either. 

I did a shot and it gave me a good rush and it seems like it has some legs, did it about 2 hours ago and it is still carrying me. 

So I just don't know. If it has no bitter taste and not much vinegar smell but has all the attributes of dope when injected, could it still possibly be cut with fent?",1470601437.0

In your experience, does holding the smoke in as long as possible allow more of the drug to be absorbed?  I've read different accounts, some saying it's absorbed as soon as it's inhaled, others saying hold it til you burst.

Second question, i'm probably gonna sound stupid, but if you were to exhale the smoke out through your nose, does it allow extra heroin to be absorbed in the nasal cavity on it's way out, or has all the drug been absorbed in the lungs and the smoke is just the waste coming out?


Edit:  One more question - Does breathing out through the tooter also allow extra residue to collect, or is it the case again that the smoke being exhaled is just smoke and none of the good stuff?

I walk up, and while in line I grab an at home sharps container since right now I just hold onto needles until I find a public restroom with a safe needle disposal bin. So I walk up to the counter, put down the at home disposal bin and ask for ""twenty half-inch 29g insulin syringes, 100 units"". I could very clearly see the boxes and boxes of syringes behind the guy, like I could have reached over and grabbed them. He repeats back what I say, puzzled, and I nod in agreement like Yeah you got it good job. He then hastily walks away and is searching up and down the walls of pills to look for syringes... The syringes that were right behind him. He asks a pharmacist for help and she gets annoyed and is like ""They're right here behind you, look here's 29g here's half inch, if he doesn't want the thirty unit ones tell him we don't have any"" (they were out of 1ml ones but I didn't care 30 units is fine). The guy grabs a box and checks me out, and I was totally not thinking and paid for this $12 box of syringes (20 needles should cost like $3) and the sharps container and leave. Get to my car to shoot and I open the box, and realize that I just 100 needles instead of 20. Well, at least I'll be set for a while. ",1470593666.0

I'm not dope sick, I don't get dope sick cause I dont use that much right? Fuckit dopesick or not I cant sleep. I need SOMETHING.

I could trip out on a few hundred mg of benadryl, naw that shit sucks and I might not even fall asleep. I wish my psychiatrist would give me a xanax script, she has written me a script for literally anything that is not a benzo. Fuch her, ill go to my buddy's girls place. Shes got xanny. I havn't seen my phone in a few days, hoping I left it at work, but Im going out looking to score with nothing by my wallet and keys.

Show up at her place, its about 11pm, no way she sleeping. I know shes a night owl.

Knock, knock knock.

Wait 3 minutes.

Knock! Knock! Knock!

Wait 2 minutes.

BANGBANGBANG.

Fuck! I lay down in her yard and smoke. The fuck am I going to do? If I dont sleep tonight ill be on 5 days no sleep. I NEED to sleep. After 3 cigarettes  it hits me to go look at my buddies place (currently at his girls house) and look for her. 

Oh man and I know they have LOADS of goodies in that house. I lived with them for a few months after HS. TO give some background, its my buddy (B) my buddys mom (M), moms boyfriend (MBF), and my buddies girl (BG)

B and I were great friends in High school, M worked as a sign language translator, that is how she met MBF. Sounds insane but she started ""dating"" this guy while translating for him IN PRISON. He had gone to jail at age 16 for murder and did not see the outside world until he was 55.

Anyways, back to the story, I was going there to find BG and get her xanax. She wasn't there. But BM let me have some of her Klonopin. Fuck yeah that really took the edge off. But sleep was still out of the question.

With the Klonopin running though my system, I find myself out back chillen with MBF. He was born deaf , and never learned how to speak but through my 6 or so months living with him I can get a general understanding of what he means. So him and I are just bullshitting. I try to ask him suboxone cause I know he has it. He wasn't getting what I meant. So i grabbed a needle from my truck and mouthed ""DOPE"".

He smiles real big and runs inside. Comes out with pen and paper.

""Swear you won't tell B or M?""

""Yeah""

""Want Suboxone or dope?""

""Dont care just wanna sleep""

""ok get in the car ill show you where to go""

Mind you I put A LOT of thinking into this. I have gotten one DUI that I am currently still on probation for, but man I NEEDED to get to sleep. I even called out of work for the next day so I could get some sleep. So off we go into the night with nothing but grunts and a tatted finger for directions. I am starting to nod a bit and I can tell its scaring him, so I let him drive. I have a blow and go, so when it goes off I still blow. 

We get there, he gets in and out of the car in like 5 minutes. Get fixes up a can to smoke the dope. I start nodding hard... like i was freaking him out, he kept asking if I was ok. I was falling out and giving him a thumbs up and we got back to the house eventually and I got an amazing 25hrs of sleep.

When I get up MBF was telling me he was scared shitless cause I was out cold for the ride back, and the blow and go didnt get the blows it needed. He just kept driving. He cant say for sure, but he thinks the alarm was going off (as it does when a test is missed) So picture it man: 55yo tatted convicted murderer, driving with a 20yo close to OD on dope, in a truck with a blow and go, thats all the lights and alarms are flashing casually driving down the road at 2am.

I still dont know how we made it back.

When we got back i was comming back up a bit and he gave me his suboxone to finish me off for sleep.

If you polyuse but don't condone it, why not? If you don't polyuse, why not? Have any fun or scary stories related to multiple drug abuse? As always, to all of the above questions, why? 

These threads have been pretty civil and enjoyable, and this topic can have some diverse opinions, so let's keep the conversation nice. For the sake of clarity, when I say drug mixing, I mean abusing multiple substances at a single time. Think of things like candy flipping, goof/speedballing, drinking while nodding, sniffing coke while doing dabs, etc. 

Thanks for the great responses as always guys, can't wait to hear thoughts and stories on this one. Happy Nodding! ",1470717119.0

My question is, what are the circumstances surrounding this? Can I buy more than one package at a time in a single location? I don't want to run into issues because they think I'm ""a drug seeker"" for wanting more than one package to take home. Are they just on the shelf in the store? Do I have to ask at the register? What is available to me? I don't even have insurance in the country I live in currently, and I don't know when I will be able to pay for it, so this is pretty important to me at the moment.

For Carl Solomon

I


I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,

dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix,

angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night,

who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,

who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,

who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,

who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,

who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,

who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,

who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night

with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,

incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,

Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,

who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,

who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi’s, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,

who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,

a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,

yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,

whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,

who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,

suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,   

who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,

who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,

who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,   

who loned it through the streets of Idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels,

who thought they were only mad when Baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy,

who jumped in limousines with the Chinaman of Oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain,

who lounged hungry and lonesome through Houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant Spaniard to converse about America and Eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to Africa,

who disappeared into the volcanoes of Mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace Chicago,

who reappeared on the West Coast investigating the FBI in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets,

who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of Capitalism,

who distributed Supercommunist pamphlets in Union Square weeping and undressing while the sirens of Los Alamos wailed them down, and wailed down Wall, and the Staten Island ferry also wailed,

who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons,

who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication,

who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts,

who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy,

who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of Atlantic and Caribbean love,

who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may,

who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a Turkish Bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword,

who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman’s loom,

who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,

who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,

who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses’ rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too,

who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden Manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,

who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam-heat and opium,

who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,

who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,

who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,

who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,

who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,

who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish,

who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom,

who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg,

who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade,

who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,

who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,

who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer,

who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,

who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other’s hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,

who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,

who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver & brooded & loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,

who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other’s salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,

who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,

who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,

who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,

I've been lurking on this sub for a few weeks now, and figured it was time join and begin participating. 

A bit of background about me:

I'm an early 30s male, born, raised, and working in the SF Bay Area - I've always worked in high tech and current manage a team of support engineers for a cyber security company. 

Somewhat ironically, I swore to myself for many years that I would never touch drugs - that is, until some friends got ahold of some beer (and pot shortly thereafter). 

My introduction to opioids started with a 5/500 script for Lortab after my wisdom teeth were removed, and although I don't remember much of those 3-4 day, I certainly enjoyed the effects. 

I didn't seek them out following this period, but my real love affair began several years later when a friend tossed me a bottle of 100 10mg oxys. After an inordinate amount of research, I ended up crushing one up, dividing into 6 piles. I snorted one, felt amazing, snorted another a little while later and was immediately nauseous and glued to the toilet for some time after. I ran our and felt crappy, not drawing the connection to w/d at the time. 

I dabbled - frequently - for the following decade, with my usage varying almost entirely based on availability (most of my supply coming from a friend's over prescribed mother - oxy, morphine, fent patches, dilaudid, etc), and with frequent emotional ups and downs as my ability to stay high ebbed and flowed. 

A year or two back, a found myself a connection that provided a couple of dozen dilaudid a month - and a near unlimited supply of subutex (the bupe being tossed in for free). Suddenly, I no longer had to get sick. 

Bupe, well as it kept me, always got boring, and I made the odd contact with folks supplying oxy - an amazing, professional guy (who tragically passed away of an unrelated OD), a Craigslist found guy selling part of his script (who fell down the rabbit hole and became a liability), and the latest (a golden ticket - a wide menu always in stock, always on time, and a consummate professional). 

None of my family knows about my use - and only one friend has any idea the extent. Though we'll see how long I can keep that up, as I came to find that the ""golden ticket"" also carries black tar. And... I like it. A lot.

I haven't been able to go back on subs, and for the first time in my using career, I'm making seriously bad financial moves in the interest of securing more dope (not to mention showing up to work late - if at all). 

I suppose I just needed to get this out into words, and tell it to someone - even if it's anonymous Internet type folks. 

TL;DR - Long time covert opioid user discovers BTH and peers into the abyss of dope-fiendom.",1470702195.0

Tonight i said fuck it and did all 3 at once but squirted the tiniest bit back on my cotton so i could do a morning shot for the sake of shooting something. Whats your guys input on this? is it even worth saving that tiny shot just for mental satisfaction of doing a shot and the possibility of prolonging your withdrawals? Or is one better off just doing all of it so you get to enjoy the high, or do half now half later to stretch it out and not get a great high but save yourself from feeling w/d's for a lil while.....ehhh idk probably consider this a shit post but when i have like no money and can only afford a few bags i go through this problem.

I'm tired of using drugs to cope with the boredom and social anxiety. I'm 18. I've been trying to get a job for a few months now. Nobody's to blame but myself. I have little to no guidance. My family will help me obtain drugs rather than talking to me about what I'm going through and what I want to do positive with my life. It makes it hard for me to talk to people and keep relationships. Therefore, getting a job is even harder for me. But I'm pushing my hardest. What I really, really want to do is Uber. I can just see myself being successful with it. But you gotta be 21. I plan on going into the Air Force. I have one more year in high school (home school) and I just want to make the best of what I got in these years I have now. I don't want to waste them using Perc's. Boredom is my worst enemy, and many other's as well. Where can I start?

While I am clean now I still thought that it was worth sharing. There are a number of cheaply available milligram scales. The most widely known and available one is the GEMINI-20 from American Weigh Scales. This scale can be found online for $20 USD. This scale is accurate down to the .001g. What if we compiled a list of weights for KNOWN legitimate pharmaceutical pills. The pharmaceutical presses should not vary in weight at all since their production is so regulated. The community could make a list of weights and their corresponding imprints. If you received a questionable pill you could weigh it using the Gemini and compare it to the list. It is important that everyone uses the same scale for consistency. This wouldn't guarantee that the pill is real, but it could provide more proof one way or another. It is unlikely that these bootleg manufactures are using the exact same fillers and binders so there is bound to be some weight discrepancy between real pharmaceuticals and the fakes. What are your thoughts? This could be used in conjunction with a test kit.",1470680153.0

When I take breaks in between now I notice two things in particular. My mouth and sinuses get really slimy. It's really strange my spit is a thick gooey consistency and my nose gets clogged with the same type of goo. And all day I have the feeling you get right before you're about to throw up.

   I would include information on ingredients, steps, risks, how midocean, equipment, costs, different ways of doing things, efficiency, and anything else you guys can think of.   

   This would mainly be for the new users, those who don't have much experience, and are at most risk of damaging themselves through liver damage, brain damage, overdose or any such other potential causes of harm. 

   My main thought is, new users are going to use whether we tell then to or not, so we might aswell and it safer for them, right? 

   If you would like to see this, comment or PM me, and I'll do what I can. Im thinking of uploading an album a week, with a large comment describing main risks, uses, ROA's and a run-down of effects.  

   On the premise that I'm fairly versed in Pharmacology, I could post some informational posts based on requests, popular demand and necessity. I could also set up some Q&amp;A sessions for those with specific questions, and also have requests, so anyone who wants to know or see something in particular can have me upload it for them and anyone else interested too. 

   I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and opinions, and if you want me to go ahead with it, I can start uploading next week, if you put some requests in this thread and have the most popular request up voted so that I can upload an album, informational post or Q&amp;A on that subject. I'll go into more detail in an intro post as to how this will work if you guys want this as a feature, and if so, I'll keep it regular, and for all users- new or seasoned in the game, this will also be regardless of your DOC, and I'll provide all the info I know on your requested topics. 

   This will be all about harm reduction and reduction and spreading correct information.  

   If anyone's interested in helping out or help running this thing if it takes off, that that would be awesome.

She almost fell down because she was so exhausted. We watched her pull out a cell phone. Minutes later the SMALLEST car (like geo metro status) pulls up and out pops 3 peeps. So she just gets in the car and about to leave when my friend rolls down the window and yells out "" YO, lemme get that bike if your just gonna leave it"". The girl pops her head out and says YA!.

I've read alot of hype about this drug, but I dont get it. 

Let me start off saying I'm addicted to Norcos and take them whenever I can get them. I've got quite a bit of gaba, but it doesn't really do anything for me. I'll take 1200mg at once (2 600mg pills) usually when I don't have Norcos and I'll feel relaxed I guess, but there is no high or recreational value.

Maybe I'm not taking enough? I dont like wasting pills, so with Norco I'll only take 2 7.5mg pills and get a good buzz on an empty stomach. Then I'll wait at least 4-6 hours before I do it again so the half life has already kicked in. Ive never taken more then 30mg at a time. I imagine Id end up vomiting and wasting them doing so.

Ive read about people staggering their doses and taking it with soda/light snack as well as some Naproxen with the first dose for increased effects. I haven't tried this, but am considering doing it when I've had a couple sober days in a row and the tolerance is shook a little bit.

Maybe staggering 1800mg in 300mg doses every half hour with the potential to up the dose to 3 grams.. that's what I'm intending to do in a couple days, maybe tomorrow night.

Ill report back with my results.

If anyone has had success with gaba let's hear about it. How much to get a high and did you stagger your dose or take them all at once?

Edit: Took almost 10g today (9600mg 4 600mg pills or 2400mg doses 4x today a few hours apart. It didnt really.do anything, maybe a relaxing feeling. There is no high with this drug.

I don't really have anyone to talk to about this in real life because I dont want people to know that I shoot dope, so I guess I came here to say that Im 2 and a half weeks sober from dope. It was fun while it lasted but ever since my parents found my rigs, which is stupid to use in their house, I know, I decided to become sober after I had a talk with them. They told me that they've seen a lot of people die while using this drug and that they never want to see me OD and having to bury their kid. That resonated hard with me because I dont want to put them through that. So thats a main reason I quit. 

The other reason is that I was just trying to match the best highs from shooting. I know its not a whole hell of a lot, but I was shooting like a bun a day/2 days. Thats when I knew it was time to take a break. I looked at my credit card account and I just saw a bunch of $60 advances. I was spending money that I needed (rent/university tuition/amenities, etc) on dope. 

I guess I just wanted to share my accomplishment, if you can even call it an accomplishment. Please everyone, stay safe -- have someone with you when using so you dont OD, take a test shot, and others just so you dont have to have your parents go through that pain.

Drank a glass of the juice and ate the bag of prunes and before I knew it I was running to the bathroom, never felt so good to piss out of my asshole...probably should stay hydrated since that was a lot of ass pissing...was in there for a good hour [NSFW?]",1470783746.0

Anything I add will be **bold**

The book has some interesting things to say, and ""trip reports"", about mescaline, marijuana, etc...

In talking about addiction, it has many interesting things to say. Remember this was written over 50 years ago, so don't judge too harshly it's outdated wordings or ideas, which are for the most part spot on. 

Regarding alcoholism: ""The cause of alcoholism lies not in the whiskey bottle but in the psyche of the unfortunates who swallow it's contents too freely. The alcoholic is sick mentally and emotionally. He belongs, according to Dr. Lolli, to that group of disturbed individuals who are labeled ""impulsive neurotics"". He is insecure, emotionally immature individual who seeks alcohol as a crutch to support him through his journey through life. Often he is more sensitive than his fellow men and is thus more prone to injury life conflicts. For this reason, creative artists often become alcoholics...What can be done to help the alcoholic? Absolutely nothing until he has reached a fixed decision to help himself. Only when grown utterly disgusted with his dependence, sunk to the bottom of the pit and come to loathe his self-inflicted degradation can he be helped to help himself. Without doubt he needs help, is a lonely being, insecure and unstable. He needs love, support, understanding....etc....

**I feel like that bit about alcohol applies to opioid addiction in a way, but this author has his own refreshing take on opioid addiction, that is in some ways strange sounding, in some ways rings very true. I could type full pages of this interesting info, but it would take too long and no one would read it all.**

""Opium in the past has had many devotees who, taking it first to relieve physical pain, came gradually to rely upon it and ultimately became it's slave"".

 Author then goes on to describe Coleridge and De Quincey. Quotes De Quincey on alcohol vs. opium, **something I agree with as put**.

""Crude opium, I affirm peremptorily, is incapable of producing any state of body at all resembling that which is produced by alcohol; and not in *degree* only incapable but even in *kind*, it is not  in the quantity of it's effects merely, but in the quality, that it differs altogether. The pleasure given by wine is always rapidly mounting, and tending to a crisis (**I believe he means getting sloppy shit drunk and feeling like trash**), after which it rapidly declines; that from opium, when once generated, is stationary for eight to ten hours; the one is a flickering flame, the other a steady and equable glow. But the main distinction lies in this-that whereas wine disorders the mental faculties, opium, on the contrary (if taken in the proper manner) (**I believe he means not nodding the hell out**), introduces amongst them the most exquisite order, legislation and harmony. Wine robs a man of his self-possession; opium sustains and reinforces it. Wine unsettles the judgement, and gives a preternatural brightness and a vivid exaltation to the contempts and the admirations, to the loves and hatreds, of the drinker; opium, on the contrary, communicates serenity and equipoise of all the faculties, active and passive, and, with respect to temper and moral feelings in general, it gives simply that sort of vital warmth which is approved by the judgement and would probably always accompany a bodily constitution of primaeval or antediluvian health (**I believe in this he means that  a person with the perfect ""zen"" happiness and mindset would already feel this way and have no positive effects to gain from opioids, which goes on to explain when this books' author describes opium addicts as ""psycopathic""**).

The author quotes a Dr. Lawrence Kolb, and says ""normal people do not derive any pleasure from opium or morphine...pleasure is derived from opiates only by psychopaths: the intensity of the pleasure produced by opiates is in direct proportion to the degree of psychopathy of the person who becomes an addict...the subsequent depression resulting from long continued use of the drug carries him far below his normal emotional plane as the first exaltation carried him above it""

**In my words, the term psychopath should be considered in this context as simply a disorder of the mind, not zombie face eating madness, and I disagree about normal people not deriving pleasure. If you are again completely happy and content with life, the high from opioids probably wouldn't do much for ya and the side effects would probably make it a complete turn off, but I feel with repeated dosing as high percentage of the population would come to enjoy the high of opioids**

More interesting tidbits:

""With the psychopath, however, the situation is different. He derives pleasure from morphine or heroin for much the same reason an alcoholic receives pleasure from alcohol. It relaxes his inner tensions and enables him to live at peace with his conflicts.""

Some addicts describe a purely physical thrill following IV use. It took the form of a feeling of warmth in the region of the abdomen. One psycopath with a low IQ described the sensation as a thrill through the body lasting 7 or 8 minutes and resembling a sexual orgasm. The brother of this individual also experienced the thrill and, though derived pleasure from it, said it did not in any way resemble a sexual feeling. (**I don't find it sexual in feeling, more of a lightheaded dizzy euphoria and release, whereas IV coke feels like an orgasm in a certain way**).

A quote by this Dr. Kolb ""That individuals may take morphine for 20 years or more without showing intellectual or moral deterioration is a common experience of every physician who has studied the subject."" [a couple cases are cited], then ""cases not uncommon, for subjects to take as much as 15 grains (**almost a gram**) of morphine daily for years without losing a day's work.
(**Here is a huge enlightened point made by this Dr**): Such addicts, however, are under the necessity of concealing a practice disapproved by the public and proscribed by law. 

And here is something HUGE: ""Dr. Kolb, in his testimony before Senator Daniel's committee, made the following statement: ""There is, a certain type of shrinking neurotic individual who can't meet the demands of life, afraid to meet people, has anxieties and fears, who if they took small amounts of narcotics, would be better and more efficient people than without it.

**That's big to me, he's basically saying opioids can have use as antidepressent/mood regulator, and that reflects the reality of many of us here on this sub who use as a form of self-medication**.

Dr. Kolb states ""These two physicians that I am talking about didn't get cured, they should have it forever, because it would not mean anything but an insane asylum for them, and they were doing a pretty good job of work as physicians when they were on the drug and regularly taking it"".

The authpor goes on to talk about physical addiction, saying ""One injection of course does not make an addict. Physical dependence is the result of frequent injections, but soon the habit of ""joy-popping"" leads to addiction. **Then described is physical addiction to people given the drug for pain management**.

**Here's the kicker, wisdom written over half a century ago that is still not widely realized**

""Just why the alcoholic is tolerated as a sick man while the opiate addict is persecuted as a criminal is hard to understand"" **hysteria, superstition, ignorance, and cruelty are mentioned as reasons**

**The ultimate kicker**: ""The addict should be able to obtain his drugs at low cost under Federal control, in conjunction with efforts to have him undergo withdrawal. Under this plan these addicts, as sick persons, would apply for medical care and supervision. Criminal acts would no longer be necessary in order to obtain a supply of the drugs and there would be no incentive to create new addicts. Agents and black markets would disappear from lack of patronage. Since about 85% of the ""pushers"" on the streets are said to be addicts, they would be glad to forego this dangerous occupation if they were furnished with their needed drug. Thus a bulk of the traffic would substantially disappear...By a change in social attitude which would regard them as sick people, and by relieving them of the economic oppression of attempting to obtain their drug supply at exorbitant prices, it will be possible to reach existing addicts in an orderly dignified way, not as probated persons or sentenced criminals. They would come under supervision in the interest of health, not entanglement with the law"".

**An even bigger kicker**: ""All the billions our society has spent enforcing criminal measures against the addict have had the sole practical result of protecting the peddler's market, artificially inflating his prices and keeping profits fantastically high. No other nation hounds its' addicts as we do and no other nation faces anything resembling our problem""...

**It is amazing to me that these ideas, obviously out there half a century ago, have not hardly taken root, and drug policy continues to remain senseless, I truly believe it is a conspiracy. All the DEA and LEO jobs, fuck Mexico probably pays us to keep it going, and just think about the cocaine and Contras, all the CIA cocaine and heroin used to fund black projects that aren't in the US budget....hmmmmm**

My dad passed away suddenly in 2007. I had a really hard time processing it, so I didnt. I was introduced to the world that is warcraft shortly before he died and it consumed my life for the next year and a half. Dropped out of school quit my job, literally all I did was play wow from sunrise to sundown while going through a 750 of vodka and an 18 pack every other day. I became my little undead priest and blocked out the rest of the world. I met a guy on there and we clicked on so many levels..addiction depression music comedy, and he was so very sweet to me. We talked for a few years while I finished my degree and I moved half way across the country for him. Needless to say, he was not at all the person I thought he was. 

We made it about a year, he was very horrible to me but I felt so stuck and I did love him.  Damn I was so depressed. He had problems with heroin in the past but he said he was clean but he started getting into PST. The longer I lived with him I realized he was pathological liar to the core. It was insane. But I digress..

He would buy maybe 8 or 10 packets of poppy seeds at the store with his food stamps, along with 6 or so boxes of lemon cake mix. I could kind of see his thought process but poppy seeds are legal and who was he fooling really.. I finally broke it off, about a year later he was getting evicted so I went back to our apartment to grab the shit I left behind while he was out at a festival blowing glass. It was horror storyesque when I got there. The place was trashed, poppy seeds EVERYWHERE imaginable. There were 4 big closets in the apartment, I opened up each one and they were stuffed to the max with fucking LEMON CAKE mix, I counted over 500 boxes, completely crazy. No one even likes lemon cake, it could have been a good cake mix at least..fuckkkkk. to this day that's all I can think of when people talk about PST. I've made it occasionally to get through w/d till I could reup,but now I just use kratom. OK, thanks.  I was never able to share this shitty story with anyone but it still haunts me sometimes.

UGH... I was recently upped in my Percocet prescription from 5/325 to 10/325 and got EXTREMELY lucky the last (first) time I filled them in getting the Qualitest (yellow V) brand. They are my favorite next to the Watson name brand percs. Well, I called the same pharmacy yesterday in preparation for today's fill and was told they only had Aurobindo or Amneal and wouldn't have a new shipment until NEXT Wednesday and didn't know what brands it would be. Disappointed, I then called Pharmacy B and was told they only carried Sun pharmaceuticals brand, grrr more fucking garbage. Then, finally, when I called pharmacy C in my area I got some relief when the HEAD PHARMACIST told me that C pharmacy ONLY carries Mallinkrodt or Actavis 10/325s... Well, even though Actavis bought out Watson and some people claim they changed the formula, I thought I'd be safer with those or Mallis versus Aurobindo, shitty Amneal or shittier Sun... 


So, today I call pharmacy C all geared up to grab my script and guess fucking what, they ONLY now have them by MAYNE Pharma! The fuck!!! I tried to google search it to find some reviews and they must have only recently began manufacturing them as I can find nothing except shit like, ""you need Percocet? I got you MAYNE"" lol and shit like that... I am soooo incredibly frustrated and I just had my FIRST appt with my new pain clinic on Friday (GP was the one to up script last month) and since I already called once to change location I hesitate to call a second time as to not appear suspicious, afraid they might think I'm selling them to picky customers who want certain brands... I guess you can't get DAW (dispensed as written) orders on C2s either so I am gonna be up shit creek probably at least until my next appointment; and even then I don't know how appropriate it would look to ask to have them switch it a second time. 




TL;DR: does anyone have any experience with MAYNE Pharma oxy 10/325s? Any input would be greatly appreciated! Thanks fam and happy Thursday! By the way I am aware that I'm a lucky SOB for getting anything, looking a gift horse isn't a good look etc, but I suffer from degenerative disk disease, ankylosing spondylitis, pinched nerve in my neck, L5 issues and sciatica, interstitial cystitis, wrist tenosynovitis, hidradenitis, plantar fasciitis and nerve damage from my second c-section so I really am a walking disaster 😔.

EDIT:

Found THIS on http://medlibrary.org/lib/rx/meds/oxycodone-and-acetaminophen-12/

Article referring to MAYNE PHARMACEUTICALS:

""10 mg oxycodone HCl is equivalent to 8.9637 mg of oxycodone""

😡😡😡

Edit 2: after typing in literally every manufacturer including Watson, apparently they ALL contain only 8.9637mg; so no matter who we go through, we're being fucked over. Lovely! 🇺🇸

Maybe I have grown so familiar with feeling down and out that when things start to go my way for once I feel out of place, and so then I unknowingly try to reintroduce the chaos and uncertainty that I'm so accustomed to? Maybe I've just got a mental disorder which means I have a predisposition towards dangerous and destructive lifestyles.

I have no idea why this is how I am, but what I can be sure of is that there is a definite and very real pattern of self destruction whenever things seem to be going well for me. I first noticed this subconscious thought pattern many years ago and after observing it for a long time I am almost certain that it is a very real phenomenon in my life.

You probably don't wanna hear my life story so I'm just gonna list a few examples that come to mind to sort of illustrate my point.

* Bought a bike a few months back. The exercise and mobility really did a lot for my mood and self worth and I felt really, really good and optimistic about life. Suddenly decided one night to cycle to a brothel and fuck a fat whore, the condom broke and I'm still waiting for results back from my HIV & Hepatitis tests. (Urine tests for chlamydia ect. came back negative)
* Meet a beautiful girl I want to spend my life with, after a few dates she confesses her love and attraction for me. I feel so good and optimistic about myself and my future that I develop a drinking problem and gradually make her hate me by being a dick, being nasty, unreliable, ect. Destroy the feelings she had for me and turn her love and desire into hate and resentment.
* Having an amazing time in Amsterdam with a group of friends. Making real life long memories and shit. Feel a little anxious cause I haven't had any codeine in a few days. No chance of finding any so I cold-cop some heroin. Stumble and shuffle around the red light district on my own all night feeling the best I have ever felt: fall madly in love with heroin and decide to find a dealer when I get back home.
* Always wanted to move to London. Move up in my job to a point where my boss puts a plan in motion to move me to the London office and set me up with a free room in a house where 2 other employees live. Dream scenario for me. Gradually start slacking, fucking up, missing work, being late, ect. until the prospect of the move becomes less and less likely and I am eventually asked to hand in my resignation.

There are many more examples of times I've fucked things up for myself but these are some of the biggest ones that come to mind. 

Why the fuck do I do it? I think that all I want in life is to be happy and to live a normal life, but can this honestly be true if every time things seem to be going my way I do everything in my power to ensure that they don't? Has anybody else noticed a pattern of self destruction in their life? Does anybody else seem to just subconsciously fuck everything up for yourself? Why the fuck do we do it?

Title is slightly misleading, but writing the whole thing out would create a bitch of an unwieldy title.

I was friends with this guy for like 8 years, I ""introduced"" him to H after he got popped for weed and he started harassing me to get him some H ""just so [he] could sleep at night."" I was about 2 months clean at the time, and I kept assuring him that fucking around with H was not something he should do.  I offered to get him some benzos, and I offered him 20 free Ambien if he was having trouble sleeping, but he insisted, and was adamant he could handle it.  ""I'm not one of those weak-minded faggots who is gonna get addicted to that shit, I'll be fine bro, I'm stronger than that.""  I told him that if I bought him H it would lead to me relapsing, and that that really wasn't something I wanted to do, but he insisted H wasn't that bad, and that I would be able to handle just snorting some every now and then without giving in to addiction.  Given the fact he was basically addicted to weed I kinda knew where it would end up, but when you're 28 you're old enough to make your own decisions, so I started giving him stuff at the astronomical price of $300/g, mainly because this would allow me to get some for myself (junkies gonna junk, right?)

What I didn't expect was that this guy would turn out to be literally the WORST dope fiend I have ever encountered.  My main connect has been in the dope game for 25 years, and he told me that my boy (we'll call him Andy) was the most terrible junkie he had ever seen.  Honestly, you know someone is bad when the middlemen who are making money off of him don't even want to deal with him.  Way before this kid was physically addicted he was mentally hooked.  One night when he knew I had gear he showed up at my house unannounced and sat in his car in my driveway from 12:00 AM until I got home at 2:30 AM.  My mom (who has known him as long as I have) was understandably suspicious, so I told her he was spending the night so we could lift early the next morning.  However, Andy refused to comply with my alibi, and left 15 minutes after coming in, which is how my mom knew for sure I had started using dope again.  When I told Andy the next day that his antics had completely exposed me to my mom, who was understandably disgusted and angry to the point of tears, he apologized profusely, claiming he had no idea coming over at 2:30 for 15 minutes would look suspicious.  His next text: ""so do you have any more Numero Quatro or no?""

Let me take a second here to say that, although Andy blew my cover, I'm still obviously a piece of shit for lying to my mom in the first place, and probably would have gotten found out anyway. Although I doubt I would have relapsed if not for him nagging me, it was still a conscious decision that I made, and I don't blame him for me relapsing. But from that point on I didn't consider us ""friends,"" as our only association was around dope, specifically me getting it for him.  As he started getting more and more desperate and continually doing insane shit regarding dope, I became more and more fed up with him.  I was getting halves for $80 and grams for $140, so I would charge him $160 for a half and $300 for a whole.  Astronomical prices, and he would oftentimes spend the entire drive to and from picking up complaining about how much I was charging him, but my mantra was basically ""nobody's forcing you to buy this shit, if you don't like the prices don't get it.""  In addition to complaining about the prices, he insisted that I was telling lies to my mother (who he was friends with for years) to ""turn her against him."" It was completely inconceivable to him that my mother didn't want a dope user hanging around her son.  He would also stalk my house anytime I was picking up.  If I told him I was picking up at 11, he would literally take off work at noon and lurk in the area texting me and blowing up my phone all day until I gave him something.  He was too stupid to even check the weight of his bags at all, so one time after he called my mom asking if she knew where I was I pinched his bag and gave him 0.2 instead of 0.5 (kid didn't even fucking notice).  Another time he was $400 in the hole to me and he called me saying he had $600, but that he would only pay me if I got him a gram.  I told him I'd picked up 1.5, went inside the house, scooped all but 0.3 out, and gave it back to him (once again, the kid was clueless).  This kid was so irritating that, despite the fact he was literally paying for my dope, I didn't want to deal with him.  I knew I would never be able to get clean with Andy always blowing me up for dope, so when I decided to get clean I told him I was getting out of the game, and I gave him my connect's number free of charge.  This was simultaneously a nice and a dick move.  Just as I had expected, getting his dope for half the price didn't save Andy money, it just meant he was buying twice as much dope.  I always figured I was just making a flimsy attempt at rationalization by telling myself I was ""helping him out"" by charging Andy such an astronomical price for dope, but when I talked to my connect recently he confirmed that Andy had gone off the deep end, copping 3-4g at a time.  My connect said he watched Andy snort an entire half a gram over the course of a 15 minute car ride.

I'm telling all this to set the stage, I'm not saying I'm a nice guy, pinching bags is shitty, but if ever there was a guy I didn't care about fucking over, it was Andy.  He has repeatedly shown time and again that all he cares about is dope, the only reason we're ""friends"" is because when someone's your friend you get better prices from them.

Anyway, a couple months ago Andy calls me freaking out because he has to take a piss test for his probation, and he thought he was in the clear because he has a vicodin prescription, but apparently this test was going to test for heroin as well.  He said the test was in 5 days, so I told him that he would be able to pass if he drank a ton of water and stopped using IMMEDIATELY.  LOLNOPE, Andy just wanted clean piss.

Now, we WERE friends for a while, and I felt for the guy.  I know what being a junkie is like, and if he had pissed positive he would have lost his apartment, his girlfriend, his job, and had a felony on his record.  So I told him I would pay the $200 it would cost to express-ship a Wizinator to my house so he could use it with my clean piss.  He thanked me profusely, and promised to pay me back within the week.

The week after his test I called him every day without getting an answer.  I was starting to actually think he might have gotten arrested when he finally answered, immediately taking an irritated tone with me, and told me that his job had cut his ability to do side work (he's a mechanic), so he could barely afford to pay his bills. What followed was 2 months of me calling once or twice a week asking him about the cash he owed me, and him insisting he didn't have a dollar to spare, and just generally acting irritated that I was trying to get him to pay back the money he owed me.  Twice he claimed to have called me (he didn't) with money, but that I didn't answer and he had had to use to money for something else.  Meanwhile my connect confirmed he would come by at least once or twice a week to cop anywhere from 2-4g at a time.  Eventually I accepted I wasn't getting my money back, and told Andy that I was done harassing him, and that if he was that much of a broke bitch, he clearly needed the money more than I did.  As someone who will tell anyone within earshot about their integrity and what a loyal friend he is, it honestly never occurred to me that Andy would ever get to such a low point as to welsh on a debt, as his integrity is pretty much his only redeeming quality.

Anyway, fast forward another couple months to today, when I get a call from Andy.  I can immediately tell that he is sick as a dog, and he tells me that our connect is in jail, and he needs to get something so he can go to work.  I silently thank Junkie Jesus for this bounty he has bestowed upon me, and calmly ask Andy what he wants.  He says he has $350.  Now as much as I would love to rob Andy blind, I've been clean for long enough that I've acquired a bothersome illness called ""basic human decency"" (trust me guys, avoid this shit like the plague, it's the fucking worst).  So after faking a phone call I tell him that I'm gonna get 1.5, he can take the gram and I'll take a half for myself (this setup is crucial).  I have him pick me up and drive me to the spot.  He is pale and covered in sweat, he looks like he hasn't showered in a couple days, he has a plastic trash bag next to him that he has been puking into, and he's making moaning noises.  The guy has Ulcerative Colitis, so he already has a lot of stomach and intestinal pain, which I imagine gets amplified pretty badly by withdrawal.  Nevertheless, he has also always been one of the biggest withdrawal babies I have ever seen; when he is sick he expects the rests of the world to take a backseat while he does whatever the fuck is necessary to get well.  As he's driving he makes no mention of the other cash he owes me, he just keeps fiending.  ""So do you think the dope's gonna be good?  I really hope it's good bro, I feel like shit.  Have his bags been on point lately?  I really hope this shit's good, the stuff I been getting from [OUR CONNECT] has been pretty weak lately, I'd be really happy if this shit's good.""  So we get to the spot, I hop out to go into McDonald's to ""make the deal.""  I come out, and since he snorts he wants to bust that shit out right there.  I tell him no way, it's broad daylight, and I need to take it home and weigh it first to make sure shit is even.  In truth, I actually don't have anything on me, which is why I insisted on saying we were getting something for me too: because I knew he was going to want to start shoving it up his nose the second I got in the car.  He whines and bitches about being sick for a few seconds, and I tell him that if he wants I'll put down 200 bucks and take the whole thing for myself.  He threatens to kick my ass, I laugh and tell him he's welcome to try.  He's always thought he was a tough guy, and it probably would have actually been a good fight back when he was 180 or so, but now he looks to be all of 145.  Meanwhile I've been lifting consistently for about 3 years now, and I've more than made up the gains I lost during my dalliance with dope, so I'm 6'1, 220 pounds, and I'm also not a shivering ball of dopesickness.  Needless to say, I win out, and he drives me home.

Once I get back to my house, I pop inside, cut the corner off a sandwich bag, and throw a spoonful of chocolate whey protein mix in there.  I twist it up, run outside, and hand him the bag.  I say ""I took a little taste while I was in there, shit is sweet as HELL, bro!  You're gonna be blown away!""  I see his face light up, and to misquote ""The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,"" my dick grew three sizes that day.

I went inside, put my money away, went upstairs, got my Glock 17 and my AK-47, put them and my phone on the table next to me, and lay down on the couch.  I closed my eyes, and I felt a level of serenity I never once got doing any of that bullshit they told me to try when I was in NA.  It was only about 5 minutes before my phone began to ring.  As I expected, it was constant.  After about 10 back-to-back calls, I got the first text:


**Andy: What the fuck bro this is bunk**

*Me: Yeah it's protein powder*

**Andy: Pete I'm coming back for my fucking money**

*Me: Come on my property and I promise I'll shoot you*

(Another 3 or 4 calls)

**Andy: YOU FUCKING FAGGOT. PICK UP THE PHONE**

(Another couple calls)

**Andy: Pete if you don't give me my fucking money back you will have to answer to me.  These are not threats they are fucking promises**

*Me: I don't think you can possibly fathom how not-afraid I am of you.  I could literally snap you in half over my knee.  You're lucky I didn't take you for all you had*



This is a novel of a post as it is, so I won't quote the entire conversation.  After 3 hours of cursing and empty threats, Andy actually began to beg, saying he was sorry for not paying me back and offering to pay another 200 for half ""For the love of God Pete PLEASE!""  Tempted as I was to sell him more cocoa powder, I took this opportunity to climb up onto my fucking HIGHEST or horses and tell him to get some fucking help.  I tried to explain to him that heroin addicts don't magically turn some corner in their addiction; as bad as shit is, it can always get worse, and it almost always will until you quit using dope.  But you know, blah blah blah, can't MAKE someone want to quit.  He'll keep using until it ruins his life, and the sad thing is that once he goes down I don't know that he'll be able to get back up.

Anyway, I felt the need to write this ridiculously long post because, while I know what I did was pretty shitty, I really don't feel that bad.  Fuck that kid.  He doesn't give 2 shits about me, as evidence by the fact that he called someone he knows has recently quit heroin offering them money to get dope.  He really doesn't give a shit about anyone or anything beyond getting well, and I knew that this was my one and only chance to get my money back, and while I don't expect any recognition for only jacking him for SOME of his money, it's more than most people would do.  I'm not sure whether I'm hoping for people to tell me I did the right thing, or tell me what a cunt I am, but feel free to do either.

**Tl;dr gave a sick asshole a bag of whey protein to clear a $200 debt he owed me**

*EDIT 2: I also feel like I should say, the protein powder was Allmax Isoflex Whey Isolate, so we're not talking Gold Standard or some offbrand bullshit here, we're talking real, uncut fire here*",1470908855.0

Though tripping is not for everyone, I think microdosing is something everybody can handle, and both have helped me immensely in so many damn ways. My depression, anxiety, trauma, insomnia, the mental illnesses all these stem from and the substance abuse issues I use to cope have all been helped immeasurably, all in what feels like healthy self-growth and not ""thoughts and feelings caused by medication"".


Always exercise caution with these substances, and treat them with respect. I just wanted to get this out there (again! (I'm sure others have made similar posts before)) in the hopes that someone else could have their lives changed in a great way like I have.

I had been completely sober for about 28 days (maybe a few coffees here and there... :D ) until today, when I relapsed and snorted enough to nod for about 6 hours, continually re-dosing to keep myself at the same level of intoxication.  &nbsp;  

For those interested in my situation: I feel like I have done pretty well staying sober, especially since it is the first time I have been completely sober in about two years; though I used heroin for the past 12 months, I used benzodiazepines, dissociatives (ketamine and nitrous) and amphetamines before that. In almost all cases I was snorting the substance I was abusing at least once every few hours, and in the majority of those it was upwards of twice per hour. In the case of heroin I was snorting and then injecting towards the end of my daily use.  &nbsp;  


I have to credit my experiences with LSD and psilocybin with my ability to rapidly cease drug use, deal with the reasons I went to it in the first place (mental illness), stay positive and make other positive changes in my life; all part of great choices I made that have lead to immense self-growth.  &nbsp;  


The main trigger was a considerable degree of pain and physical/mental discomfort I was in due to food poisoning, a bad case of influenza and an upper respiratory infection, which has had me bedridden for the past 4 days.  &nbsp;  


TL;DR Been off heroin for a month after 12 months on it (mainly snorting, sometimes injecting). Relapsed, what should I expect in terms of recovering in all areas?  &nbsp;  



Thank you all for the help you have given to me and to other people. You are all amazing human beings, even if you don't believe it to be so. We are all doing our best to cope, be and enjoy life.  
Be the change you want to see in the world.

Today's discussion is gonna revolve around advice! The big question is this: what advice would you like to give the opiate community? I know this is a big one, and it covers a variety of topics, but that's the point of this one. Lots of ideas regarding lots of the aspects of this lifestyle. 

Some more specific ""guide"" questions in case you're stuck trying to figure out the advice to give:

Current users of (DOC), what advice would you give other users of (DOC)? 

DBoys, what advice would you give buyers to be better customers? Customers, what advice would you give dealers? 

People who have quit either successfully or unsuccessfully (remember, success is subjective), how would you advise people looking to stop using? 

People who shoot/snort/(insert ROA here), what would you like to tell other people who have the same ROA to improve their experience? 

Most importantly (although that's also subjective), what harm reduction advice do you have for the community here? 

What misinformation do you see often, and what is the actual information that gets misinterpreted? 

As always, please feel free to explain why you answer the way you do, it helps feed the discussion and helps us understand where you come from with your answers! 

Remember folks, some of these answers will be opinions. Remember not to down vote discussion or *opinions* you disagree with, only down vote truly irrelevant comments or rule breaking ones, as well as misinformation/harmful ideas, i.e. if someone suggests shooting alcohol with their pills to get higher or something. 

There's a whole lot that can be talked about here, and I'm excited to see all of your responses. Sorry yesterday's thread was kinda shitty, hopefully I'll be able to keep quality back up from here out. Thanks everyone for the words of wisdom here, and Happy Nodding! ",1470889224.0

For those of you who expressed an interest in the outcome, I ended up returning the pills. I got them back in time that it hadn't been logged as missing yet, so the pharmacist responsible for the fuck up didn't have to face any consequences. It definitely was one of the toughest decisions I've ever had to make, but possibly saving her career made it worth it to me. I just got out of rehab a few months ago and am finally getting out of sober living in a month, so another relapse would've set me back a shit ton.

The walk home my face is beat with the California heat

And then straight to the bathroom sink, where I imbibe in my treat

followed by a nod-out over the piss-stained toilet seat

where I give back to the earth what little I could afford to eat

Like these fast moving clock hands

Our hard-earned cash goes straight to the man

As grands escape our hands like grains of sand 

In trade for the grams, that are never enough even slammed

The monster cries out, and we give in without a doubt

“We are addicts” for gods forgiveness we shout

And pray that tomorrow is the day

That this monster finally lets up and goes away

But when tomorrow comes it’s all about the funds

The money is the essential element in the equation our minds hum

If I can get off work then I can finally be sick

But I can’t afford to take off work that’s the kick

If I could a year later i'd still try to rationalize it

So what’s a guy to do, but give in entirely to you

Adjust to this new normal as my life comes unglued

I’m anti-social un-hormonal and rarely eat food

It’s a daily struggle, a constant struggle, here lies nothing good


Two years passed since my last and I’m still holding on

But in that time twice as many friends are gone

I ask god for them back, knowing damn well it don’t work like that

So I cast aside my rational mind

And I imbibe, back to the toilet seat where I hide

Constant Struggle

Daily Struggle

It's been over 72 hours, and I have no experienced physical symptoms thanks to Suboxone. The most difficult part was two things-- fear of withdrawals (fear of the unknown), and the abrupt stopping of a habit.

The fear was overcome with support from friends/family, and by just getting through one night without Kratom. I replaced the habit of drinking kratom tea with another caffeine-free tea from Target. I will continue to drink this tea, as it is a calming part of my evening. It seems as if all effects of Kratom were just placebo effects. I'm starting grad school this month, and will try and stay determined to stay off the drug. Thanks to everyone who commented.


edit--- I've been on Suboxone for a long time under a Drs. care. I'm starting grad school and have no plans of coming off in the next year. I know Suboxone is strong, please no lectures on that. All I want to know is if I stop Kratom while also on Suboxone, will there be any withdrawal affects, and what they are like. I do appreciate you guys looking out for me, but for reasons I don't want to get into, I will be staying on Suboxone. PM if you want to know how I ended up on Suboxone and why I'm going to stay on it for the forseeable future.


This is a peculiar question I realize....and I may sound like a pussy, that's because I am.

Has anyone successfully mitigated Kratom withdrawals with Suboxone? My situation is a bit weird, in that I'm prescribed Suboxone (I have plenty of it) and have been taking Kratom as well. 

If I upped my suboxone dose a bit (took it at night when I usually take Kratom), would I avoid Kratom withdrawals?

In order to stay on Suboxone (I'm prescribed) Dr. says I must get off Kratom.

I really appreciate any input, expecially those who have switched from Kratom to Suboxone.",1470877450.0

     Hey guys! I'm a long time lurker of this sub (for anonymity - but I now have an r/opiates Reddit account for moments such as this) and I have a question for the veteran bangers. 
     I typically insufflate my dope, as I prefer it over smoking, and *usually* over shooting (the prep time for shooting is often too long for my incredibly impatient ass, and I don't do it often); however, I have been banging my dope here and there over the past week because I'm starting a WT detox on Sunday - and honestly, for the sake of my bank account, and to make my dope stretch as much as I can with the smallest doses to get me well, shooting has become the most economical route of use for me (as I'm on the tail-end of my dope taper and preparing to drop this shit and never look back in 2 days).
     Long story short, I just did my bedtime shot, and and immediately after my face and body got incredibly hot, my heart started racing/pounding, my face flushed red, and my hands began shaking. 
     I'm by no means a noob when it comes to shooting, and heroin in general, as I've been an active user for about 2 years - but I've never had this happen. The only comparable experiences were when was when I was sold cocaine and fentanyl (on separate occasions), but both of those times I was snorting my ""dope"" rather than shooting.
     The only thing that I can think of that I did differently on this particular occasion, was that I didn't filter my dope with cotton or a micron filter. I just drew it up into my rig from the spoon, and I had just wiped down my spoon with isopropyl alcohol. I'm wondering if my body's reaction was due shooting un-filtered dope (but even then, a cotton filter only really does so much), or possibly from accidentally shooting a trace amount of the rubbing alcohol that may have been residually on the surface of the spoon. 
     I know for a fact that my dboy did not sell me anything cut with fentanyl, or any other unusual drug/chemical/powder other than his usual vitamin C/lactose cut.
     In addition to this, I will disclose that I do suffer from GAD and I typically get anxiety every time that I do bang my dope because, well, it can be very dangerous if done incorrectly or carelessly. Yet, I was pretty calm when I was preparing my shot and while I was actively shooting. Even when my body started to freak the fuck out, I took slow deep breaths and stood still and did the whole ""calm your tits u/Nietzche_is_Peachy7"" mental peptalk until it subsided about 3 minutes later. 
     Any thoughts on what may have caused such a reaction? Because I'd rather not experience that again if I can avoid it.",1470991716.0

Coffee cigarettes black and green tea and hundreds of foods all contain mao inhibitors

Mao I s increase cns depression and prevent the break down of serotonin

Fentanyl raises seratonin levels. high serotonin levels can lead to respiratory and gut acidosis which can lead to a cycle of malnutrition and bulimia or even death, when we of course factor in fentanyls inherit respiratory depressing effects this is already bad enough. Considering most of you have impaired livers and kidneys from alcohol abuse and at some point during your use you will encounter a potent potentiator such as GARLIC or black pepper or an mao containing food drink or herb. Bad news. Your breathing technique and oxygen or levels in your blood also affect the way this drugs potency even your stomach ph.

Contrary to popular belief in the boards of the internet probably by the fault of foreigners aiming to hurt America's brightest. america honor those who paid the final measure of devotion with the poppy flower after all ..memorial day

Bluelight and shroomery drugs forum and erowid are so infested with disinfo its simply scary.

Is that fentanyl half life is some 50 odd hours transdermally. Don't bother posting about the reason being because its time released you are I'll informed. Fentanyl ltself Hangs around for days even with oral and buccal and nasal and smoking and i.m. use.

This shit will kill you after your first yawning bout after you put 10 mcg onto your arm if you are sussceptible. All the while wondering when it will hit as you somehow ignore the burning in your legs from breathing once every 80 or so seconds is blotted out by this drugs anaesthetic and anticholinergic effects. And possible effects on the amygdala causing you to ignore fear inducing stimuli. If your lucky you will realise you are dying and wake up before you lose the ability to talk and use of your digits and limbs.

Opiates and opioid affect gaba also.

Loperamide same distinct class of opioid has been shown somewhere to potentially damage the bbb which is inherently wider in male's than in females, a dose that was safe a month ago may now be deadly for one reason or another diet sleep etc. Inflamation of the bb b can be caused by simple things like antibiotics or even a shot...

Assuming you dont get gear or mislabeled fent that contains aceylfentanyl which is essentially an opioid made out of glue which may or may not ever be detached from your receptors.

Even with real fent it feels like literal trash like doxylamine fucked buperonephrine and had a baby with a birth defect that causes the pronounced side effects listed above.

I could cwe 30 mgs of dph and get more rest on a Saturday than I would ever be able to on this scam of an excuse for an opioid.

Now with the danger discussed why is this drug useless even for the dying?

Opium pods are not needed to produce bupe morphine etc. Hogwash. Neither are gmo opium creating yeast needed.

Morphine will forever remain king of the opium alkaloids. Morphine is non toxic no matter the dose until you are malnourished or experiencing hypoxia afaik. While demerit same class as fentanyl I believe is pereipheally and centrally neurotoxin.

Fentanyl will you when you least expect it.

I relapsed a couple months ago and have been lurking and decided ""what the heck"" and signed back up. 

Anyway, I have a dumb little method to avoid the possibility of cotton fever. I've gotten the fever multiple times before from cotton washes and every time after I'd swear off reusing old cottons, but forget all about that swear when I run out of dope and start to get sick. 

But now I do something different in order to get that cotton shot. After I inject my regular dose, I squirt in 40 units of water into the spoon and stir it around and stir/press on the cotton for 15-20 seconds, then draw up the solution. I set that syringe aside. On my next dose later on, after I shoot the regular dose, I take the syringe with the 40 units of cotton wash from earlier and squirt that in the spoon and repeat the process. I just do this for every shot until I go through my stash (I usually buy a gram of Baltimore dope at a time) and at the end the solution is pretty tan/gold and tastes really bitter, which is a good sign. If I have any empty dope bags that still have a little powder in them, I scrape it off into the spoon and add that to my cotton wash solution. So essentially it ends up just being an extra shot at the end, but sometimes I have the willpower to really hold on to it and use it when I absolutely need to, like if I run out of dope at 7pm and I know I'll be able to score tomorrow morning, I can either use the cotton solution as a wake up shot if I'm too sick to do the hour long drive or I can save it and keep adding more using the next gram I get. 

Idk, I thought I could share something that might help someone out. The cotton shot's potency is 50/50, it just depends on how long I've been able to hold on to it and how many cottons I've washed with it. But the important part is I've never gotten the cotton fever using it. ",1470945753.0

I have been waiting for withdrawls to start for me to take the zubsolv again but it's been days and I feel fine. What gives? Could it be because the syrup was extended release? ",1470941276.0

Hey guys, got a non-urgent question that may or may not be opiate related. So, yesterday I went to shoot into a side of my wrist vein (in line with my thumb but down around my write area) and got a ridiculously large histamine reaction seconds after the needle went in, I didn't shoot anything or register, I assume there was some dope in the tip or something. Anyways my hand looked like a small island nation for about an hour. Don't worry, the shot mainlined just fine. No pain, went away no issues. Now, today, hand mildly swollen, a little up my arm about an inch away from my wrist (hold your hand up in front of you like you're telling someone to stop, and go an inch up the arm from where the skin folds) is a raised red patch, it's noticeably red but not very raised. It's mildly warm, and 1.5-2 inches in diameter. It does not itch or hurt, and has shown no sign of growing. This is not in an area I injected yesterday, but I have shot into the vein in that area before. It may not be anything important at all, or even related to any of the events I mentioned, but I was wondering if anyone has experience with something like this? It's possible my arm is having an allergic reaction to something topical, I don't know. Just wondering if anyone had any idea what it may be. Thanks for help, I know it's probably nothing, no worries or hurry. ",1470936761.0

Today the question is about your favorite music, and this is a pretty vague question, which leaves some room for interpretation when you answer. What are your favorite artists? What's your favorite genre? Favorite album? Favorite song? Anything in particular you listen to while shooting? Any songs/artists/genres/etc you *don't* listen to anymore? To all the above as always, why? 

This is one where I'm quite ready to hear some answers, so I'm pretty excited about it. I hope everyone expresses themselves, and please, keep it civil.

My main dude for the past year pretty much has recently opened a legitimate storefront business and had a kid in the past month. He is usually pretty good about staying full with boy, and has become somewhat reliable with girl. To give you too much information he has actually had me come to this business he owns, and made me wait out back in a parking lot, behind his dock door, for anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes. I think it is a little stupid to shit where you eat but I can't complain because I'm getting my stuff sooner and usually waiting less. He used to make me wait at least an hour at a gas station or park in the middle of bumfuck nowhere.  

However, two weeks ago, he told me hey I won't be good until tomorrow. Okay, no big deal, this has happened in the past where he has run out for a day or two tops. So I hit up the b squad for the day, and hit him up in the morning. Same response. Okay no problem, rinse and repeat. And repeat. 

Then I just didn't hit him up for a couple days because I figured he is working on his business and family life for a minute, but he will be back before the week is up. After a week of going through bsquad which they are second string for a reason,   quality, I hit him up and he swears up and down tomorrow Fo Sho. I don't believe him, but hit him up the next day anyway. Same response.

Flash forward to tonight, it has been two weeks, and he swears on his kids that it will be tomorrow morning or tonight after 3am if I want it that bad. Which I wish I knew before my last pickup since I wasted 150 on some bullshit. But still there is a little bit of doubt in my mind that he will either not pick up his phone tomorrow or will just tell me the same shit.

Sorry if you read all that, but that's what I have been dealing with. And my bsquad is weird or his stuff is. He is very punctual, and sets you up in a spot where you're not in the hood and cops arent surrounding you either. The stuff he has been getting recently is very chunky almost solid when he gives it to me, but breaks down easily with a soft pinch. With water it is very dark and doesn't dissolve well or react well to heat. I heat sometimes with big chunks to help dissolve, but this shit becomes goo. And you might go through 3 cottons trying to fill one shot especially without heat. Really weird. The shit can give you a nod though. However, occasionally, you might get cotton fever symtpoms. Cold, headache, and all around groggy. Mind you I am not cleaning cottons and mixing that with cotton water, but just his stuff alone. It has happened from different bags but obviously the same stuff, and he gets it by the boatloads so God only knows when his lineup will change. It is very strange and has only happened to me once or twice before, coming from H alone, but at least 3 times in the past two weeks with this stuff. 

Hope there aren't too many typos, I am tired as fuck, but just wanted to check in and tell yall about life around the River City. Hope everyone is doing good and avoiding fever, and fuck I just remembered I need to order more rigs. Much love and happy nods!

TLDR: usual guy said ""tomorrow"" for 14 days straight, and my bsquad is giving me cotton fever occasionally.",1471063046.0

After a long time waiting to hear from the cops who had cut me loose saying they'd be in touch, I got a call recently that they'd filed a warrant for my arrest and would have to book me. Was in and out of booking faster than I expected, got a court date in a few weeks. Still have my job, and my family still doesn't know, as the cops were nice enough to haul me in discreetly.

I've never been in trouble, so from what everyone tells me I should get first offender status and no felony record. I also have an appointment with a sub doctor in a few days which will help in court.

Points:

1) despite what people on here say, they can come get you later if they let you go when they initially bust you with the dope

2) After being on nothing but subs for over a week, I feel almost completely normal. It always sucked when I had to use them for a day or two here and there because I couldn't score, but this is actually not bad. My appetite, sex drive, and interest in work are even coming back. My theory is that being dependent on a partial agonist is different than being dependent on a full agonist. It's like having 75% of a dope habit - you go through a very mild dope sickness that lasts about as long as real dope sickness would, after which you readjust.

3) The cops really don't care if I help them or not (of course I'm not a rat). They didn't even bother with the good cop/bad cop routine they pulled when I was arrested. It was like bored cop/bored cop this time. As someone said previously, they needed to get someone leaving that dope house with a gram, and they got that. They already have what they wanted from me.

Be careful out there. I intend to stay off, but if I ever do go back, let's just say the bitcoin way is the safer way. Really.",1471043639.0

I want to know what y'all use (if anything) that works and also what you would recommend for me in my particular situation.

Anyway, I have used Dramamine and found that I can do more opana without feeling nausea and that bloated feeling from doing too much over the course of a day. I've also heard DXM not only potentiates but also helps keep tolerance down. I just popped a Tums and am gonna wait for y'all to respond before I do another line of panda. I heard Tums potentiates...didn't just take it for fun. 

Some background on me if you feel like giving me advise: 

1/) My tolerance is pretty high (do 40mg on an average day) and I only have 10mg left and won't be able to get more until I get my paycheck tomorrow and I'm already hankering to do the whole 10mg tonight, but I only have half a subutec left and would rather have that for emergencies since they have been hard to come by since my sub guy decided to get his ass arrested.

2.) Intranasal insufflation is my preferred mode of ingestion and I do anywhere from 20-60mg a day depending on how much $ I have on hand, but would say 40mg is my average. 

3.) I took some some vyvanse earlier before work and a lorazepam a bit ago to come down off the Vyv nice and gently.

Yes, I know I could bang it and I'd get higher than snorting it, but I believe it would a) shorten the duration, b) risk having my GF get pissed at me, and then c.) there's the whole ""I've been snorting opana for 3 years and it gets me plenty highj mantra I keep trying to convince myself."" I've shot up dope a handful of times and dilaudid once, and I have absolutely zero judgment towards those who shoot up and do not think I am any less of a junkie or they any more of a junkie than myself..I just personally believe it would be game over for me if I started regularly shooting up. Especially since my opiate of choice is opana...I've seen firsthand what shooting up those things does to your heart, lungs, insides, injection sites...for those of you that do inject opana...please be careful! I barely keep my shit together snorting the damn things bc they're so fucking expensive.

I thought I would be fine because I used to bang a couple gs a day of nice light brown blow dope. Guess what!? I was wrong. As soon as I ran out of my script, I started looking. That was two weeks ago. Too sketched out to go try and cold cop, and I wouldn't even know where to start in a new area. Sooo, I get on CL after reading something on here. Meet up, get served some fake shit. Okokok I was dumb. Try something else off CL and get taken for 400. Apparently cash can be collected from moneygram without a reference number.

So, I've been a heroin addict for 12 years now, minus a few tears in prison(although I did shoot dope semi regularly there too) Anyways. Yesterday I call my dude, he's dry, so I go on the hunt. End up copping from a dude I generally don't deal with a lot. The dope looks weird , its blackish but really soft, but not quite bth. Oh well. Put a half G in some water, fire away. No rush. At all. So now I am thinking this cock sucker sprayed vinegar on some bullshit and sold it to me. About 2 minutes after shooting it, my body gets that warm fuzzy feeling you get after doing dope , my pupils are constricted and I am starting to feel kinda high. Okay, not as high as I would of liked, but hey its something. And then it hits me. My head starts to POUND. I am talking worst head ache of my entire life. I can't even walk Its hurting so bad. It's just a non stop pain. I end up throwing up and taking some Tylenol and ibuprofen. An hour later it finally quits. Wake up this morning , shoot another .4 of the same dope, same exact thing happens. Has anyone ever had this happen and care to explain ? Needless to say, I won't be doing that dope again, but in all the years I've been junked out, I've never had this happen. What is it?",1471024069.0

Should I stop (haven't smoked in about an hour) and come down at work or keep using a little to make it through my shift??? I haven't slept in about 30hrs if that matters. I also used about .5g of shitty bth when I first started smoking (h was also smoked). Also (sorry) I get super sweaty and shaky when I'm really tweaked, but so far, people don't seem able to know that I'm high

1 b) Given how much I have used (.5g of very high quality meth from DNM over the course of 4/5hours), did I honestly use too much with my current tolerance? I've always hit the pipe or foil compulsively, rarely doing anything else but getting spun 

2) I spilled some crystal on my tile counter in bathroom. It got wet, dissolved a little, and re-hardened on the tile, where it is now stuck.

I can't believe what I've become. I need to remember all of the shitty side effects of this drug. Even though it produces probably the best feeling I will ever experience, 10x better than dope, it's still too harmful to keep chasing. There's a limited number of outcomes here. You die, either from a heart attack or even just taking too much, what will your family think? A meth overdose? Fucking really? 

I'll sure go insane some day. I can't be awake for all of these days, sleep for one night and then go back to normal. There's a comedown, a pretty shitty one. I won't always have access to dope or benzos to get rid of the paranoia, hallucinations and torturous physical symptoms. One day I'm gonna be tweaked out for one too many days where I will be bound to have a psychotic break. I absolutely am sure of it. 

Ezra most likely had a psychotic break. He was a good kid growing up, but I guess was struggling with scitzophrenisa. One day, he lost it. Killed his grandparents by bashing their skulls out with a baseball bat. Hours later he called 911, saying ""I am covered in blood and I don't know why"". He was wearing shorts, a t-shirt, and no socks... on one of the coldest days of the year. I remember crying at their funeral the moment I locked eyes with Erica, Ezra's mom, and the daughter of the two he killed. She had this look of despair and brokenness that could make the toughest of the tough burst into tears. Although I do not think I am capable of murder, there's a shit ton that I am capable of. Things that I would never do if I wasn't tweaked the fuck out. I've heard the stories, and I know the likelihood of this happening. Psychosis will make one of my worst nightmares come true; disappointing my family to a point of no return. If I keep up with these binges, there will be no positive outcome. 

I actually don't know why I'm writing this. I'm smart, and I am aware of this. I love meth too much. It will ruin my life if I use it as much as I want to.

I ran around down the line looking for the zip-lock, and couldn't find it. She looked like she wanted to cry. I get back and I tell her that I didn't find them.

He was originally on 60ml methadone and reduced this to 20ml. He begged his doctor to put him on lofexidine (spelling?) and despite specialists thinking this was a bad idea it was his choice. He went through an awful withdrawal and begged us for help. The doctors refused to put him back on methadone or subutex for about a week and a half of him shaking and vommitting. Eventually, after I look for advice from specialists I knew at other hospitals, we convinced them to commence 4mg of subutex.

He is now absolutely terrified of reducing the 4mg at all because he feels he will experience that same pain and we won't listen to him. I was wondering if anyone on here had any experience of how to reduce from a low dose, anything that eased your pain (from prescribed medications to food and comforts)? 

Also I understand that some peoole stay on a low maintaining dose for years and years - but for reasons which are difficult to explain quickly, he can't go to a pharmacy daily or have weekly pick ups of medication.

Anyway, thanl you for reading, I hope this is the right sub!

Mine is now but for the first time today I had a scary experience coping H. So before i start let me just say this is my fault and I didn't think it through. So usually how it goes is I hit up my dealer he says he is good and gives me a street to go to generally in the same area, same city at least. I always pick up a bun and its 65. But my boy wanted 2 bags so i asked him for 12. So i finally get out there and pull over on the street he told me to. I texted him when i was getting off the exit and said how much for the 12? So when i pulled up on that street i saw he had replied 130. So im like woah he misunderstood so i call him and explain i only wanted to on top of the bun and only had 110 or i would grab both. He says dont worry just pay me the rest next time. Which is cool because i always have the money and never ask for fronts so that was straight of him. He asks where i am because the road is quite long and i tell him I describe where i am, he says cool im pullin up right now i see you, pull into that building up there. 

Now real quick every time we do a transaction he is usually in the same car but sometimes drives a secondary car. He either pulls up behind me and hops in or comes up to my window.
So right when he said ""im pullin up go pull out and park in that building over there"". So i turn my head and see the second car that he drives and its the exact same car i couldn't tell it was any different. He pulls in right in front of me. Im waiting waiting waiting finally i decide okay he wants me to get in. I've been sitting here for a minute no one else is here and he hasn't called me so i go walk up to the car open the back door and there is 2 black guys i have never seen before in my entire life in there bugging out. I literally almost shit my pants, my heart dropped and I said ""holy fuck wrong car wrong car i am so fucking sorry"" and started to walk quickly back to my car and they get out and start to run at me. Once they realized i wasn't trying to hurt them or do anything sketchy their mood completely changed and the driver says ""oh u wanted something i got u i got u, calm down whatchu need?"" and i was so nervous at first i was like ok are these guys with my boy? Def not. He asked how much weed i wanted and he could tell by my expression i didnt want weed. So he goes you want crack and im like nah dope but i gotta go im sorry and he was like take my number down take my number down. In my head i was like okay my guy has the best stuff and its the only shit that is legit and good that i can find and he has always been so loyal to me so i knew i just had to go. Right when im getting in my car he rolls up and pulls the window down and knew something was up so he rolls forward and talks with the guy for a second, they roll off and he backs up with a very pissed off look and says follow me. I felt so embarrassed and followed him for a few minutes and he finally pulls into a secluded area. He gets in my car and first off says why didnt you answer I've been trying to call you? I go what? Dude you never called look, he looks at my phone and says whatever forget about it what happened and i explain exactly what happened and he interrupts and says nah nah nah don't give me that shit my nigga, there's no excuse i never told you to get in, i always come to you, you know how it is or we meet window to window. I started to explain more and thats when he realized i was really shooken and started to laugh and said hey calm down calm down you can't even count your money. I understand you got nervous and thought you were supposed to get in, and i did tell you i was rollin up, i just worry because you could have gotten hurt. (hell yeah i could have skinny white boy in the ghetto are you kidding me). He gave me my two buns and said just pay me next time and stay safe. So i pull off drive for a minute calming down and pull into a gas station to set my GPS. It wasn't working nothing on my phone was. And i just started to laugh. I have an LG G4 and once and a while it does this thing where it says ""im offline"" and nothing on my phone works and i need to restart it. But the reason i laughed is because of course my phone has to fuck up and right there and thats what my guy meant when i was following him and he said he was trying to call me.  It wasn't ringing through. 
Moral of the story I fucked up by getting nervous and impulsively making the decision to get into that guys car. Btw he had tints just like my dude so i couldn't see until the door was opened. I'm just glad he was cool with me and everything worked out.

I opened the door to the wrong car in the hood, thinking it was my dealer.

I took it because I have moderate to severe general anxiety, social anxiety, some anxiety attacks, and lately have been falling into depression. I heard a Tramadol high would be good for anxiety and depression from the fact of it being an SSRI and from the opiate euphoria.  
This was my first opiate, and unlike what many others have said online, I had a great experience with this. I love it, I definitely want to take it again, but I have to be careful and stay in control. This may be pretty long, as I wanted to be as detailed as I could when documenting the high.  
According to other's reactions online, I was lucky and had an awesome reaction, it's probably also because it was my first opiate and I rarely do drugs.  
The purpose of this is just to help anyone who would want to know what this is like, hopefully this helps someone in any way. Anyways, Here it is: 

**TRIP REPORT**

**Update for myself and others later on:**

Its about 2 hours and 40 minutes after 100mg, and I just feel amazing. Very slight body high, meaning no jitters or shaking or looking tweaked out or whatever. Depressive thoughts and feelings are gone! I'm browsing depressing posts on different subs and sites, and where I used to feel so emotional and depressed, I just think like ""oh that sucks, it'll get better, it has for me."" For things where I used to get angry and jealous, I'm like ""You know what, great for you, there you go!"" I feel a bit energized, well not really, maybe more lively. I am kind of singing in my head to a fast beat and bobbing my head along, but I control it and that's as odd as this high gets. 

I heard Trammy highs can cause itchiness, none of that happening. Also, it can make you nauseous and have headaches, none of that either. I was also getting very thirsty and cotton mouthed, but I drank a couple glasses of water and the dizziness mostly went away. 

I just feel upbeat, like I can do things, happy for others and myself, slightly energized, feeling simply great. I have to control myself with these drugs though, I know what fuckery addiction can do. Also, the words are just like flowing out of my mind and I'm typing somewhat quicker than usual, so this may seem slightly unorganized or not sound as grammatically correct. I hope I can fall asleep well in a couple hours. Shame, I should have saved this for tomorrow when I had time to do things. I heard the high can last for like 10+ hours, I hope it does! Hope the crash is minimal or doesn't hit me too. Hopefully, maybe I can even remember how I feel now tomorrow and it will be enough to kick me out of feeling shitty, like maybe this will be some kind of turning point, one can dream! 

P.S. My mind is thinking at about average speed for me, which is probably faster than most people, except now it's just like funny and happy random things. Still feel totally in control, not like some drug fiend out of their mind you see on youtube. Sorry for how long this is, I just want to be detailed and document this well to remember what it's like.

**Update:**  
4 hours in, I actually have been getting kind of itchy. Mostly my nose, now some small spots on my back and shoulders. Have been eating some chips and drinking some water, seems to have helped with being light headed and dizzy. Euphoria feels to be wearing off already suddenly. I don't feel bad again, but starting to feel just normal instead of great like described before. Unless I'm just getting tired. 

**Update 2:**  
About 15 minutes later now, 4 hours 15 minutes in. Definitely coming down now, I'm fairly certain. I'm feeling kind of sleepy and tired, but not to where I think I'll knock out or to where I'm nodding. Kind of tired, but relaxed. Feeling normal, meaning not great and upbeat like before, but not depressed or anxious or emotional. Just a chill feeling watching videos, shows, and such. It's a very calm and gentle come down, but it came quite suddenly and unexpectedly, like a quick slope down that you would see on a line graph. Still getting itchy, it's random spots now getting itchy all over my body, but it's not too bad, not my entire body itchy at once or whatever. My nose started being itchy first and has been the most itchy for some reason. Almost forgot another detail; my breathing was kind of weird, it was normal and not difficult, but I found myself almost forgetting to breathe at some points as I was holding my breath. To be more specific, it would stop at the bottom of an exhalation. Odd, but not scary or dangerous seeming.

Overall, love this stuff! Just wish it would last a bit longer. If I do it again - which I do want to, but am wary of abusing it - I'll try 150mg then. I'll also take some Zyrtec to see if that helps with the itchiness. If I start getting emotional or depressed tomorrow, I'll try to think back to this great feeling and state of mind I was in, like life wasn't such an irreparable shit hole for me after all, I'm just making it out to be that way, making myself feel it is, how I had the energy and willpower to go do what I wanted and know is best for me without being afraid of myself or others. 

So this turned out to be a nice little trip report as well. Hope this helps others!

**Update 3:**  
15 minutes later now. Ok now I'm really starting to be getting sleepy. Still doubt I'll knock out, but it feels like it'll be time to hit the hay in probably another 15 to 30 minutes. Guess I'll be missing The Eric Andre Show tonight :(

**Update 4:**  
Okay its 6 hours in now. Still awake. I feel like a zombie. Getting a headache and zoning out. Still kind of dizzy. Feeling normal, not great, not depressing. Somehow still going, like my CNS is energized just enough from a stim to chug along, but my mind is frying. Goodnight. 

**Update 5:**  
6 hours and 45 minutes in. I feel physically dead. The crash was harder than I thought, but it wasn't painful or too uncomfortable or anything. The itching didn't last long, it's been long gone. The crash is just like a bad stimulant crash, like a caffeine crash. I'm in bed. This is the last update for the night. It's 1:45 am. I just measured my heart rate, and it's 53 BPM, which falls well below the ""normal adult resting"" range according to my phone. Imagine if I died in my sleep, haha, that would kind of fucking suck. Having come this far recently, for nothing now. I'm just fucking around, but it is a low BPM, although it shouldn't be dangerous. *knocks hard on wood*  
Oh yeah, state of mind. Not depressed or whatever, just chilling, but all I care about is going to sleep. Goddamn, I hope the morning isn't bad from this. We'll have to wait and see. See you all on the other side of the rainbow.

**(The last paragraph was during early in the morning of the next day at 1:45 am, the next part below is from after I woke up after about 7 hours of sleep. I usually sleep 8.5-9 hours, and I felt good to go after just 7, but I laid in bed for a couple hours on my phone)**

Final update. So it only lasted really, a couple hours, but they were the best I've felt in too long of a time. 13 h 45 minutes after taking them now. Any trace of a high is completely gone, I only have memories and this post. The depression and emotion shit has been coming back this morning, but fuck, I need to get over it and just do me. It's so incredibly tempting to just take a couple pills and feel great, like a magic pill, but I know how absolutely stupid that would be with a narcotic and I'm not going to fuck myself harder than ever with that. I just have to remember how I felt and how I was thinking I could do anything, I was on top of the world... from my house.
Don't feel hungover or whatever. Maybe a slight headache, but coffee should fix that fine, and it could be because I didn't sleep as much as usual. I think this trammy acts as a moderate stim too. Again, all psychological effects are completely gone, but it helps to remember how I felt and how I can feel like that naturally if I really want.
Anyways, great reaction for me, amazing drug. Almost too amazing for some with lower self control or more addictive personalities than myself. Definitely try this if you never have, especially if it's your first opiate, but be careful to not let a tiny pill control you. It was a very clear and controlled high, possibly unlike hydro, oxy, codeine, other opiates that I've heard make your like foggy minded and stuff. The dizziness was the only downside, which felt like just enough to where I wouldn't want to drive. The high came somewhat slowly, but once it started, it got to the peak relatively quickly, and it hovered around a peak level for a couple hours, but then out of nowhere you stop feeling so amazing in a matter of a couple or few minutes, then in another 15 minutes you're crashing. That would be the other downside, it's steep gradients on the come up and especially come down. If anything else, it took a bit long to hit, for me it was over an hour to start feeling anything, and that was on an empty stomach.
Okay, this is really long again. Well, that's all. That's all how it's like from start to finish and the next day. It has my newb seal of approval. Way better than xanax for anxiety and depression, it fucking wipes it clean off your mind and replaces it with enthusiasm, happiness, etc., but it has harsher side effects (dizziness, light headed, breathing, heart beat) and a crash.",1471120576.0

Also, I'd take 1800 mg of gabapentin in the same fashion.

I went into the doctors office to get a few things checked out. I never mention to my doctors that I am a IV drug addict, unless I have to. I walk in and go through the usual procedure. I tell the nurse that I've been very fatigued, having very bad headaches, not very hungry, and also that my pee, no matter how much fucking water I drink, is the color of apple juice. She tells me to piss in a cup and I do just that. I hand it to her and she says ""you weren't lying"". I shrug my shoulders and sit down and wait for the doctor. Eventually, she strolls in. Probably one of the chilliest doctors I've ever had. She didn't seemed worried at all and just asked me about my lifestyle. She told me I seemed to be one of the healthiest kids on campus (hah). She tells me I'll have to get my blood drawn so she can run some lab work. I go do that and get a lil' rush from watching the whole thing happen. I leave thinking nothing of the visit and go on throughout my week. Today, she calls me twice. This scares me because in my experience doctors call with lab results and leave a message if you don't answer. I listen to the voicemail she left after the second attempt of calling me. She tells me my kidneys are fine and my electrolyte levels are a-okay. Then, she mentions that my liver function test was ""elevated"". I immediately think, ""fuck.. Hep c"". From that voicemail at 7:58AM this morning I've been worried sick. 

I have shared needles in the past, only with three people. It was definitely in the worst of my addiction. Now I feel like I'm gonna have to pay the damn cost of that. I am hoping that by some miracle it isn't hep c and that it is just some bullshit that can be resolved very easily.

On this last day before classes start on campus, I just want to take in the beautiful landscape where I live and appreciate the mostly healthy life I've been able to live for 20 years. I love life so much, I would be devastated to know what I've done to myself. Today, I am just going to enjoy the beauty that is in every second of life. I hope you can do the same too",1471275021.0

I'm a 22 year old guy who lives in southern Maryland, I'm a third year apprentice with local 5 IW and honestly for my age I have pretty decent income. I moved out of my grandparents house about a year ago and got my own place (three bed two bath ranch house for only 1100 a month). I had no problem making rent and honestly I really enjoyed being by myself seeing as I work nights. Now one thing you gotta know about me is that I'm an opiate addict, I've been this way for years. So living alone was nice seeing as I didn't have to worry about Hiding shit. I've learned that being an addict doesn't mean I can't live a normal life, and while I know it's not the best path but its the path I'm on. 
OK so now that's out of the way we can start haha. Two months ago I was a bar after work and I happened to meet one of my best friends from high school. We got to talking and ended up finding out that both of us were in the same situation. We exchanged numbers and I headed back home. Two and a half weeks go by before he called me again at two am. He said that him and his girl had gotten into a fight and she kicked him out, he asked if he could park his car in my driveway so he didn't have to sleep in a random parking lot. I told him I had a spare room that was furnished that he was welcome to stay in as long as he was willing to pay a small amount for rent. He ended up being pretty much out of cash but he ended up having a script for suboxone which was even better for me. He moved in the next morning and honestly it seemed like every thing was going great. Little did I know I had graciously open my door for the devil. 
Three days in and the first incident occurred, seeing as I work blue collar it's just about impossible for me to do my job while in opiate withdraw I always made sure I have a a few days worth of hydrocodone for emergencies. Well when I was I about to leave for work I noticed the bottle had be moved, upon further inspection I instantly realized they had be replaced with Tylenol. I ended up not confronting him because i didn't want to deal with it.
Two days after that, I come home from work at one am I was greeted by a young woman slouched over a chair with a syringe at her feet and blood covered arm. I went over to washout and re cap her rig so just In case it was her only one to prevent it from getting clogged. As soon as I did that I got a wet towel and went to wipe her arm. The second I grabbed her wrist to do this I realized she was cold, completely unresponsive and clearly hypoxic. I ran to my vehicle and grabbed my suboxone, I quickly used her syringe to dissolve about two thirds and gave her a attempted IM to save time. Two minutes later she was in precipitated W/D. The ambulance arrived twenty minutes after that, I honestly think without doing this she most likely of died. Turns out that this girl was the one who kicked him, he had been letting her stay the night while I was on night shift. And where was he throughout this whole ordeal? He was in my fucking shead looking desperately for some chore boy so he could take a blast of hard that he Bought by using all my spare change I save... But only the fucking silver, he left me all the Penny's...

Ive been b on pst for a month and a half or so now, and it was going good, was able to start tapering down, even got down to a real low dose and held that for a week or so. But now im just so depressed again, and it's not like i wasnt for the last year, but ive been able to just nod out and forget life for a bit occasionally I'd hurt myself ""on accident"".

But basically this last week ive been cutting non stop even sneaking away from work to cut and everything. Went back to a really fucking high pst dose and im not able to drown thr sadness out anymore. I cant stop cutting. Im numb and not in tge good way anymore. I just want out. I feel like i need to make the switch back to heavy stuff so i can either nod all day or maybe OD of im lucky. Im sick of this.

I'm the guy from Scotland that found 90 grams of decent number 3 a few months ago ahhh good times !!! Though as you can imagine the ending wasn't that great and started slipping into old ways . One of the reasons i had to make a new account is I sold my Ipad on buy back but things fucked up and couldn't get the cash to get it back in time :( 
    Plus I started grafting/hustling again the usual thieving and fucking people over basically being a right dick to people or getting a loan of money from friends and family and not paying it back . So after a few weeks of that shit I decided I'm not going back down that road again that is basically a vicious circle of drugs ,crime ,jail and repeat . The guy I was hanging about with was a right thieving bastard and stole from me (xbone one games) with the excuse I stole a bag from him which was bullshit as the cunt was full of Valium and just couldn't remember . So I cut that cunt off and barred him from my house / I continued on for a week or so and just got to breaking point and decided I was just getting to old for this shit . So I had twop weeks worth of methadone saved up which I get every week from an old friend 70/80ml every Tuesday like clock work . Good friend but he never comes out any more as he suffers from agoraphobia and sitting with him can be a bit tedious as he's always going on about the ""Good old days"" which weren't all that good to begin with as being a complete arsehole to society aint that great and violence ain't really my thing plus being slashed/stabbed or dealing it out isnt that fun though surprisingly at the time doesn't hurt much. So I knocked the H on the head and started a  5 day reduction on methadone with a few dihydrocodeine (DF'S 30MG) at the end . It's basically a full proof way of coming of basically pain free and in the 18 years I've been doing this shit it's hand's down the best way !!
         I've been off for nearly two weeks and thought I'd treat myself  on this miserable Sunday so I popped into town and got a half G (£20) and took some works with me and also went for something to eat at Burger King as I couldnt be fucked cooking anything when I got home plus I could have a hit in the toilets and save myself 30p by not using the public  toilets down the street. Plus they have those stupid blue lights that are meant to stop you from finding a vein but really don't work as most folk know where there veins are located but I suppose it could deter new users . Though it does kinda annoy me as your paying to use them so you should be able to use them as you wish . A lot of places now have sin bins in the toilets to dispose of used needles safely but nope not in my butt fuck of a town . Though it does have multiple needle exchanges and Naloxone is easy to get which I'm sure has saved many lives since it was introduced . But i'm going off on a tangent not really sure what the point of this post is ... I suppose just a bit of a rant and to say hello .

I was warned about this particular stamp been goin around for a couple days, and now that the warning has turned out to be accurate I want to pass it on.


This time, when I go to the spot to wait on him there are a couple other junkies there & when they pin me for being there to cop they both warn me: the new stamp, with an Indian head and says ""I'M APACHE"" is insanely strong. They've had habits for almost a decade: both regularly shoot 5 bags at a time, but when they used the new stamp last night a two-stamp shot fucking knocked em both out instantly. I tell em that I just sniff the shit but they say ""you gotta start off sniffing half a bag, and dont do more for at least an hour or so even if it takes a minute to kick in.""


When the man comes, lo and behold the stamp is indeed this APACHE stuff. So I follow their advice and do only a half a stamp, sniffed! It's a tiny amount, I've been using for years and although I don't have a serious habit rn I generally do a bundle in a day on my own. But Jesus Christ this half a bag has me nodding out in the Dairy Queen right now ans I can barwly write this shit. It's getting stronger as I write rn too.


Now the trick is this: the genlemen who warned me told me they didnt. think it was fent, because it had serious legs. Guy said ""when I did this two bag shot last night, I went to sleep after and woke up ten and a half hours later, the next morning, still high as fuck!"" But since I have no way of IDing fent or some other dangerous cut... I feel like I should warn people who live in the area.



People of East Williamsburg, Bushwick, Bed Stuy! Be exceptionally careful if you come across a bag with the stamp ""I'M APACHE"" with the profilr kf man in a feather headdress. Do a small small test shot, even if u snirtjnf start it off slow. This shit is crazy crazy strong and I would not be surprised if there's some crazy cut in high purity junk to produce thesr results.Be safe!

I've done h a few times but I don't have a connect and I'd like to keep it that way (for obvious reasons.) Back when I lived on the Southside of Savannah, I struck up a friendship with an old lady. Somehow it came up that she had a prescription for pain pills and she asked my ex and I if we thought we could help her get rid of them. I was completely naive to them at this point but my ex being the junkie he was jumped right on that. Apparently this woman got 120 hydro 10s (she was getting hydros at the time) a month and took only a half at a time when she was having a bad day. She literally handed over about 300 of them trusting us to sell them for what they were worth. We sold a few but the majority of them my ex and I gobbled up like Thanksgiving dinner. We'd throw her some money every week until they were all ""sold.""  Definitely didn't give her what they were worth but she was pleased. 

Not long after, my ex and I split and I moved across town. I kept in touch with the lady and bought a few off of her here and there. A year or so later, I start dating a new guy. He and his friends were big into cocaine and I like it alright but I was like ""heyyy, what do you think about these instead?"" He loved them of course (who doesn't) and complained he just couldn't find any. We start seeing the sweet old lady on the Southside and three years later we're still going by her house weekly if not daily. 

It's mostly an awesome situation. I am the only person she sells to so all of her script goes to me. It's always the same price and the product is always good. I never have to worry about it being a fake pill or cut with fent. There's no sketchiness factor. There's no waiting an hour when the person said they'd be there in 20 mins. We literally go sit down with her at her house for a few mins, talk about random shit, get what we want and leave. She's pretty much always home, always sitting on her couch smoking a cigarette with a smile on her face asking ""how many do y'all want?""

The only downside is we burn thru her script in no time... We can make it last two weeks if we use some restraint. But the other two weeks of the month we're left asking around if anyone has heard anything, looking for friends on that other subreddit which shall not be named, experimenting with poppyseed tea or kratom, or mostly just being fucking sober and counting down the days til our favorite old lady gets her refill.

(I've written on a large variety of projects before, at least 1200+ pages)
My script idea is about a man named Nordan. He's in his early twenties, fresh out of college, working at a convenience store and lives with his pregnant girlfriend while trying to save money to launch his own business. However, Nordan has developed anxiety from his childhood living with an abusive, alcoholic father. Due to stress from work and the upcoming child, his anxiety worsens and eventually leads to a series of horrible panic attacks. He's prescribed Xanax and falls in love with him, quickly slipping into addiction. Meanwhile his mother who lives with his brother, struggles to support themselves, forcing the little brother to get involved in drug dealing to support himself. Nordan becomes severely addicted to Benzos, causing trouble with his work and relationship with his girlfriend. After his doctor learns about his abuse, he stops prescribing Nordan the pills. Out of desperation, Nordan begins seeking out to drug dealers to acquire his drugs. One day his dealer is out of benzos and he ends up buying opiate pills to deal with the withdrawal. He falls in love with them and proceeds on to abuse them. His boss learns about his abuse and fires him. As his girlfriend finds out about his addiction and recent firing, they end up in a rough confrontation, resulting in her leaving and Nordan completely isolating himself and spiraling out of control. His mother learns about the brothers drug dealing and reaches out to Nordan, only to learn about his growing addiction, worsening her own personal issues. His tolerance increases and he starts spending his saved money on pills, but he quickly runs out of cash. With no job and money, he finds a cheaper solution - heroin. He starts off snorting it and eventually injecting it. Meanwhile his brother gets involved in serious trouble with the drug dealers and his mother slips into depression. Unable to pay his rent, Nordan gets evicted and lives in his car, desperately trying to earn money. He starts robbing, shoplifting and eventually stealing from friends and family. He also starts developing serious mental issues from his drug abuse (Depression, Psychosis). Seeing no other option, his mother reaches out to the father, who's been clean for years, to help Nordan with his addiction. Nordan rejects the father, continuing on with his lifestyle.
I'm currently working on the ending, but i have three different scenarios in my mind: 1. He goes through rehab and gets clean. 2. He continues on and ends up in jail. 3. He continues on and ends up overdosing.

TL;DR - A man with anxiety working at a convenience store with an upcoming child starts abusing drugs to cope with his life. He ends up in a deep heroin addiction, ruining the life of himself and everyone around him. His mother seeks out to his father to help him, but he's the one who caused his anxiety in the first place (He was an abusive alcoholic).

I'm really trying to show the true horrors of drug addiction. How quick it can occur, what it feels like, what people are willing to do in order to get their drugs and especially on how it affects the person and everyone around him/her. I want it to feel true, authentic and relatable.
I have tons of ideas, scenes and quotes for the movie, but these are some of my favorite:

""Heroin fill the empty void inside of me""

""It's 4 hours since my last shot and my soul aches and cries from it's core to the tip of my 
hairs. My clothes feel like sandpaper grinding against my body.""

""I lay back on my bed, floating away on a sky of euphoria, tears rolling down my face, an odd mixture of remorse, joy, grief and pleasure.""

A scene where he sits alone in the darkness in an abandoned house on his birthday. He sits in front of a store-bought cake with a lone candle and a syringe in his arm.

A scene where he dreams of a perfectly normal life with his girlfriend and child, where he afterwards wakes up to the living hell he's enduring.

A scene where his little brother finds him overdosed on the toilet and rushes him to the hospital in the middle of the night, saving his life.

I would love to hear your opinion on the project (How it sounds, if it's any good etc.) and i'm open to all feedback, ideas and so on. Sorry for the long post but this is a project i have a burning desire to make.

It has really helped me stay away from alcohol which has always been my drug of choice. At the end of August, it will have been three years since I've had a drink. Im very proud of that. My life has gotten immeasurably better since I've quit drinking. Anyway, kratom has helped a lot with that. 

Every month or two, a friend of mine sells me five 30mg ER opanas (the ones you can crush) and ten 10mg IR opanas for about $200 (friend prices, obvi). I do a little pill binge for a couple days, then use the kratom to level back out. I have very, very mild withdraw symptoms that are pretty well managed with the kratom. 

So two months ago my pill friend says that there's this stuff called U-17. Supposed to be 100x stronger than fentanyl and it's legal. He knows I'm fairly tech savvy and asked me to look into it. Long story short, I determine that U-17 is NOT ANYTHING I want to fuck with. Ever. However, there's another, more promising substance, U-47700. Stronger than morphine, but doesn't have to be dosed in mcg like U-17. 

I start to look around and do some research on u-47700. I find some and start to try it. I'm completely blown away by the amount of euphoria I feel. It seemed to me that the euphoria was somewhere between dilaudid and opana (admittedly, I've never IV'd dilaudid which is supposed to be the king of euphoria besides heroin), with opana slightly edging u-47 out in the euphoria category. Of course, opana and dilaudid last way longer than u-47 which I think has been documented enough at this point. 

So anyway, use 1g of u-47 over a few days. Run out, start kratom. Felt clammy for a couple days but nothing too serious. Order almost 2g the next time. Use the 2g over about 4.5 days. Get another order for 3 grams, but made sure I had another 3 grams before I ran out again. 

Point of all this is to say that the kratom hasn't been handling the withdraw symptoms very well. I think I need suboxone. Can you all suggest a taper schedule and how much suboxone I should take over a week or two? I'm not sure how long I should wait after the last dose of u-47 I should wait to take the subs as to prevent precipitated withdraw.

Any insight you all have on this would be great. I definitely jumped in over my head and I'm flailing a bit at this point.

Thank you :)",1471194608.0
