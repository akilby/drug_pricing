I ran out early last month and landed myself right in the heat of withdrawal when my dad visited from 18 hours away. He drove 18 hours to spend 3 days with me, drunk and withdrawing, and I completely ruined our visit. 

I had good intentions to do better with this refill. I have a 7 day pill box. I cut them into halves and set out my weeks worth. 

Then that weeks worth ran out and I kept dipping. I'm right back up to a dosage that's triple my prescribed daily amount. The worst part of this refill is my doc cut a pill a day so I am already working with 30 less than normal. 

I still have half my script left but Idk how long that will last. The kicker is I'm not even enjoying them. Usually I'm active and energetic when I take my oxy but I had the flu 2 weeks ago and my body has just changed. I've slept all day every day this week. I feel stupid and sick on them. Why do I keep redosing? 

I can't let myself sit here and go through wd this weekend cause that would seriously suck for my family, but come Monday, I'll have all day all week to deal with the effects. 

If I can stick to my dosing schedule I'll have at least 40 left on Monday. Even if I go to the excess I'll still have a weeks worth left of my script. I think it will help the wd knowing I'm sitting on pills. I won't feel so desperate. I can start taking then the week before my refill. 

Sorry for rambling. I'm just so pissed at myself. The road to hell is paved with good intentions I guess. ",1523625101.0

Im currently focusing on Oxycodone if that makes any difference.

Firstly, anything that will potentiate Oxycodone so that a lower dose is required.

Secondly, drug combinations (such as benzos) that add to the experience. 

I really value the opinion of this community and the knowledge that lies within. This is why I am asking opinions over just browsing potentiator forums. 

Just as a side note, I am aware of the potential pitfalls (over and above drug use for recreational purposes) so there is no need to be conservative.

Background: we are habitual users with a daily habit of anywhere from a half to a whole G on a typical day (and we snort it). Anything we get we split down the middle. We take turns buying it for the day but it isn't quite 50/50, I buy more than she does, and usually get a greater amount than she does when she's the one purchasing. Because of this I feel that I'm doing more to support our habit than she does. 

But here's the argument: I'm currently (and newly) unemployed but I receive a pretty decent inheritance check every 2 weeks and I'm the sole buyer for us until that money we budgeted for our habit is gone(typically anywhere from 5-8 days), at which point she takes over until the next check comes. 

She is also unemployed but doesn't receive a check like me, so shes always finding new and exciting ways to generate money (and no, she doesn't trick or Rob people for it in any capacity).

Her most recent hustle, and probably the most clever IMO, was approaching people and asking if they can help her with a bachelorette party scavenger hunt that she has until Saturday to complete (today is Thursday). One of the tasks is that she has to get a minimum of $50 in donations from strangers (from any multitude of ppl, she isn't  asking 1 person to donate $50 themselves) . 

To further legitimize her ruse so as not to appear like a scam she tells the ""donator"" that she has to get a pic with them and the $ and have them initial her scavanger hunt paper to ""prove she isn't cheating"" by using her own money to accomplish this task. Pretty scandalous and quite clever right?

Anyway obviously her way takes a lot more effort than simply getting a check, but her way also generates less funds and takes a lot longer than my way. It took about 3-4 hours to come up with $60, which is really the bare minimum amount we need to get enough for us to split and be Ok for the day. 

She says that even though were typically only getting enough to get by  when she's the one buying that her contribution is actually worth more than mine bc of the amount of time/energy, and thought that goes in to her plans. 

I disagree. 

So we are giving the argument to you good people to decide once and for all who's doing more for our habit- my greater amounts with almost no effort, or her smaller but acceptable bags for us to split.

TLDR: I spend more money on H for us to split 50/50 than she does with little to no effort via a bi-weekly inheritance check/ once that $ is gone she takes over and buys smaller bags but with great effort and time consuming plays. Who's making the greater contribution to our needs?


Addt'l info on her scavanger hunt play: to try to encourage people to ""donate"" more $ for the game she says that all the money generated is going towards the honeymoon for the fictitious couple and that whomever comes up with the most money by the hunts and will receive a call bonus and a day spa certificate and whomever had the largest single person donation will also receive a cash prize.


I've included pictures of the pretend scavanger hunt rules and tasks she created at her request to show the people she's asking for donations from so you can see how much effort she put in to this plan.",1523599116.0

I’ve been on 16mg of Suboxone (the white half moons + 155) daily for the past 9 months, and to be honest, I’m sick and tired of all the doctor appointments, making up reasons why I need a certain time of day off of work, telling friends and family that I see a psychiatrist when it’s really a Suboxone clinic... I just want off the Suboxone.

I’ve read some really conflicting information on what it’s like coming off of Suboxone; some say it’s the worst opioid withdrawal I’ll ever experience, and some say it’s quite easy. Before I got on Suboxone, I was physically dependent on oxymorphone. If I couldn’t get my hands on that, it was oxycodone. Always something, every single day just to not be sick.

Has anyone ever came off of Suboxone on their own, without the ridiculous “3-4 year weaning” process these Suboxone doctors put people on? I wouldn’t want to just up and quit cold turkey, but what do you all think it would be like after 9 months or so of two 8mg tablets a day? How fast could I wean myself down to nothing?

I've been snorting pills/heroin for the last 7 years. The past 2 years have been strictly h and between. 5 and a gram a day. I switched to the needle 2 months ago because my breathing had gotten so bad that I couldn't walk up stairs without being out of breath. Also, I got tired of living with the ""death rattle "" at nights for the past year. I used to use a netti pot fairly regular, but was always shocked that NOTHING ever came out.

Fast forward to now...

I have a major sinus infection and I'm blowing ridiculous amounts of stuff out of my nose. However, what has me concerned is seeing a thin rubber like membrane that I'm also blowing out in small pieces. (Since its coming out of my nose, its actually pretty big). They best description would be a rubbery thin film thats the thickness of a condom and you have to actually tear apart to break up.

I'm assuming that what this is, is my sinuses had gotten a coating of drugs that over time had formed a rubbery film? If this is the case, it would explain why A. I never got anything out after using the netti pot... and B. Why my lungs had gotten so bad so quick. My sinuses no longer were absorbing anything because it basically had something similar to a condom that was covering everything that the dope would have normally attached to?

My questions are this...

1st. Has anyone else experienced this?

2nd. Does my theory seem plausible?

3rd. Any idea how to get rid of this? The only time I ever get this stuff out is when I have a sinus infection. The last SI mainly had this film coming out of the right nostril and now, it's the left nostril. (I'm getting regular heavy mucus out of the other nostril).

4th. Can you think of any other possible reason/thing this is? 

I'd love to go to the doctor, but I've basically bankrupted my family and I don't have insurance. So unfortunately, seeing a doctor is out of the question unless this becomes serious. ",1523595242.0

Xtampza is Oxycodone proper and not Oxycodone Hydrochloride which is why XT's are 9,18,27 and 36mg - evidently it converts to the 10,20,30 and 40mg equivalents during metabolism or something.

Anyway, she charged $10 for the 18's which is a great price for oxy  imho. Well when she got upgraded to the 27's she left the price the same - $10 for basically 30mg of oxy. IMHO you gotta be a fucking idiot to turn that down but fuck if I can get anyone interested in them.

I don't get it.

I've been on Vivitrol for about 14 days and its pretty terrible stuff IMO. INSANE insomnia and a strange kind of crippling depression and agoraphobia-ish type anxiety i never had before, along with other more minor physical symptoms. (Pain and stomach issues.)

Because I can't handle this shit, I've been trying to research a way to break through that infernal shot, to little avail. Been reading about how Suboxone/bupe can bypass it, so naturally i acquired some and insufflated 4mg.

I was quite underwhelmed, and though i doubt it was placebo for various reasons, I did manage to feel a teeny bit less anhedonic (i can actually talk without a flat affect, and leave my house--seriously.. I wish the psychiatrist would've warned me about these issues (i did ask), but the way he presented it, Vivitrol is as harmless as chamomile tea.)

Digging online reveals that most people who have success breaking through vivitrol do so by IVing the bupe/Suboxone..usually in like 1-2mg amounts.

I only have Suboxone (no subutex) so I'm a little wary of risking putting myself through PWD (considering the naloxone) though is that even really an issue when you get down to the fundamental pharmacokinetics?

Shouldn't the residual naltrexone perhaps block the naloxone? I know for me, bupe itself doesn't block naloxone like it does for many folks who IV Suboxone. (I had a bad experience IVing it some years ago, so first hand experience in that regard.) Really tempted to try it though, as pathetic and desperate as that may sound.

Also I've seen tramadol mentioned but much less info seems available on that. I'd appreciate it if anyone has any information on that, or anything else that would displace the damn naltrexone on my mu-opioid happy spots.

Are there any other methods to screw with the injection itself, apart from cutting oneself open? Like some kind of way to metabolize the gel release thing faster than usual, perhaps some kind of ass cheek exercises combined with grape fruit juice and hydroxycut? (I joke.)

But seriously, is there any way to nullify this thing? You'd think they'd (the drug company) create a way to reverse the shot in case of emergency adverse symptoms.

Please, any tips or anecdotes please! I am desperate .",1523570735.0

Shit posts regarding my “habit(s)” etc, make me feel normal... from the feedback. So, last Thursday I tossed my guy $50. He’s a middle, but kind of a friend. We’ve gone hunting a few times together, played pool, he’s chilled at my place and vice versa. He’s on pain management, relative of a really good friend. He likes to play games sometimes.... “I’ll be good at 2pm tomorrow “. You call at 1:00, no answer. 3 days later you get a text... “are you coming to grab these or what?” Than he bitches you out for not being there at 2pm. However..... if he gives you a day and a time and you show up, he’s fucking pissed you didn’t call before you came. Yah, it’s like that. Today is day 7 of waiting for what I needed 7 days ago, his uncle has been sick and actually passed yesterday. “He will call me when it’s good, don’t call him”. Sad part is, his uncle really is sick and I assume did pass away. I did the dt’s already, took my normal kratom daily. I’m nearly off the kratom now too, though I still feel shitty after an ounce a day for months.  I’ve really been keeping my nose clean the last 18 or so months, 11-12of which I was on methadone. Stuck to daily kratom and that’s been it. I decided to dabble with the fucking roxy again, I probably even chipped successfully in all reality. But the bullshit and games are the same every time. I met a guy that was laboring for one of my professional contacts yesterday, I cracked a joke about pills..... he says, “My wife gets the little pink ones, Christ she probably has 4 or 500 sitting around. I haven’t text him..... yet. Dude will show back up, he won’t burn me; not even worried about that. I don’t know if it’s worth going down the rabbit hole again or not.

I have only tried cold-medicine with codeine before, around 100mg 3 times, and it was fairly enjoyable. I have also been addicted to alcohol for the past 2 years (not very heavy use but still every day).


Therefore, i bought 5 30mg IR oxycodone a couple of months back from a guy with a script, but I have been unsure whether I want to go down this road or not. In my mind I would use occasionally for as long as I could until I ran out of money, in which case I would end it (unless doing opiates changed my outlook on life).


In the best case scenario, I would be able to use opiates for a while, possibly become addicted and maybe have some sort of revelation about life. In this scenario, finding a purpose in life would far outweigh the negative effects of addiction, as I would be alive instead of dead (since most normal people hold life above all others, it wouldnt matter if i were addicted as long as i was alive)


In the worst case scenario, I would use opiates, fall in love with them and become addicted, run out of money, and then still not have the courage to off myself, and I would be stuck in a ""mental prison"" which according to what I've read here for the past 3 years is 1000x worse than regular depression.


What I'm looking for is people who have been in a similar situation who could shed some light on what they did and how it worked out.


Please refrain from posting ""it gets better"", ""you mean so much to X and Y"", "" just get help bro lol"" etc.. I've had my dose of those messages while browsing for suicide methods and statistics. If anything, they make me feel worse, because it is this ""fake compassion to look good in front of others"" that is a major factor in my negative mood.

Well when my actual dude came through he threw a cig pack in my car when I handed him the money and then split fast.

So, how can you tell what your current tolerance is and if you can safely redose.

Say for example; I take 40mg of OC at 2pm (crushed/parachuted) Then at 3pm I snort another 20mg. Then 3.30pm, another 20mg dose. 

Say then at 4.30pm I'm feeling high but would like to be higher. How do I know what a safe amount would be to take. I've never had a problem and my doses have probably maxed at 160mg throughout the day. 

The only guide I go by is obviously if I'm feeling good but also measure heart rate. If that drops below 60bpm, I tend to slow it down. Is the dose response curve fairly wide if you are resonably experienced?

The problem is it doesn't seem to be very effective, atleast in the last 4 to 5 days of using it. What I was thinking about doing is using the neosporin before bed and a few times throughout the day, and vitamin E oil in the morning and maybe once or twice throughout they day, and then using the lotion and coconut oil 2 to 3 times throughout the day. Thoughts? Any other suggestions. If it takes forever to heal I can also start using make up, although I'd rather not since I've never used make up before and I'm worried it'll look like shit because of it. ",1523531039.0

And he gets back to me really quick which was strange because it was six in the morning West Coast time. And so we’ve been having some pretty serious conversations for people that don’t know each other. And he has a Hunch from our convos and he asks me if I do anything more than weed. 

I was expecting him to say he has some coke or acid or some shit, but low and behold I get his number and we start texting, and of the first thing he says he has is dark and kpins. 

Like I’ve been looking for any benzo for so long and he gets legit rx ones 😍😍😍. 

But yeah and today actaully was dudes birthday and he was celebrating because he is on probation for PCS, but just had his color called yesterday so he is golden. 

And if all of this wasn’t good enough I thought I had $109 to my name, which of course was going to all
Be spent on dope today regardless, oh btw $140 today got me 7 points of 6/10 bth. 

Anyway I check my bank app this morning and my tax return went through! Needless to say about $600 today is gone and it’s been awesome. I hope everyone else has a fair day. Days like today literally never happen to me so I had to share.

How in the fucking world can I only get my hands on Hydromorphone 8mg? Well, those and the occasional percs; I have one other random dude who has 10/325 percs. They are the RP 10/325. Circle, no split line, they look like Tramadol or some bs when I first saw them but they're legit.
Iv take a few pharmacology courses at Uni but I'm at a cross-tolerance paradox, or maybe I'm not, please help me understand this.
I feel more off 3 of those 10/325 binder filled percs than I do off of sniffing or boofing 16+mg of Hydromorphone. 

Advice? Should I go on a tolerance break? Are my nostrils just fucked?

Once every few weeks to once every couple months. I decided to buy some kratom from my local head shop. Honestly it's really boring to me. A couple grams gives me a mood boost for the rest of the day. 7-12g very very very slightly relaxes me and makes me kinda talkative. No euphoria though. Feels like it wants to be an opiate but obviously isn't lol. Anyways I noticed something. I took about 3g in the morning (noon is my morning time) and went about my day. Hadn't used opiates in a month or two. I got ahold of a nice 30mg of hydrocodone my usual dose. Ate it with a semifull stomach. It kicked me in my ass something similar to the first time using MDMA euphoria. Used a couple times since and I've gotten nothing like that. I'm going to take a couple weeks break and try it with kratom again. I was just wondering if anybody else has had this experience or can confirm this happens. I thought it would have the opposite effect. Would taking kratom when the highs going away be effective? I'm just really curious as to how it can potentiate euphoria,1523523756.0

My doses are anywhere from 30mg to 60mg depending on if I've been using daily or been taking breaks. Anyways. Even on super heavy doses now and with breaks the euphoria has gotten really weak. Only lasts like an hour and even my nods are getting weak. So I've switched to oxy. While oxy is way better for my money as I'm taking 15mg-20mg for a similar if not cheaper price than the hydrocodone and getting the old euphoria I was missing, I'm getting no nod at all. The nod and euphoria really went amazing together. I don't want to take a whole 30 and get nauseous just to attempt to nod. Is there anything you guys recommend for me to get a nod? Will like .5mg - 1mg of xanax do it for me? I take about 3mg-4mg to get high on xanax and that's a pretty weak one to me. With no tolerance I can't feel a bar so .5mg to 1mg is like nothing to me. My blackout range on xanax is about 6mg. I can take 5mg and remember everything and not be too crazy. I know those doses sound crazy I don't know why I have such a high natural tolerance to xanax but I do. Sorry about explaining my Xanax tolerance here I was hoping it'd help. Is there another opiate you would recommend to achieve the old hydrocodone effects? I don't want to do heroin again I don't really like it. Maybe what we have here is just really shitty. Actually I know what we have here is really shitty $60 grams and I can do a gram in two - three days easy. I can do a gram in a day if I'm really pushing.

Did you taper? If so how slowly and how were your withdrawal symptoms and what was the duration?
I am absolutely horrified. Everything I read online says it’s months long and I’ve only ever been able to make it 3-4 days and then it’s so bad I have attempted suicide/ given up and gotten back on them.
I’ve been on them for three years, I take 16 mg a day.
I am so tired of them controlling my life and having to be scared if my dr fucks up and forgets to call it in. 
I just feel like I’m right back where I was when I was using when I feel that way, all over unstable and not knowing when I’m gonna get sick and when or how I’ll feel better and that fucking panic that sets in.
I have a baby girl and just want to be the best mom I can be to her, my parents were opiate addicts and I don’t want her to be in this cycle.
I’ve not touched anything else in two years and other than subs I’ve gotten my life together. 
The only part left is to get off the subs. 
I’m just so scared of the withdrawal.
Looking for real experiences good or bad.
There’s a lot on google but people don’t mention if they mean their bones aches and their stomach felt removed for months of they are talking about PAWS or what.

Do the opiates stay in your body or just get flushed out since they can't stick to your receptors?  Can you go ahead and take suboxone the next day and keep on with your maintenance or do you have to wait until withdrawal to start sub again even though you never felt the opiates and they were never able to bind to your receptors? 

I was under the impression suboxone wipes all the opiates out of your system, and unless you wait long enough after your last suboxone (24-72 hours) dose you will not be able to feel anything from opiates.  If that is true then do the opiates that you tried to relapse with even stick to receptors in your body or do they just get flushed out as if you hadn't taken a thing and you ended up just ""wasting"" pain pills?

Like I said, I know this happens all the time and for the most part you just have to deal with it but when it happens a lot is there something else you do to try and make sure it won't be shorted?

Lately i made the stupid decision to use again. Thought i could just have a little nostalgic fun with heroin again. I scored 0.1 just for a shot or two, sounded like a good idea at the time. And ive had such great control with my drinking and weed lately i thought id be fine.

Well time flew and 5 days later i was still using, at 0.25g a day. Woke up yesterday morning and felt pretty crappy, by some miracle i woke up with a bit of clarity though; and got rid off all my rigs and called my 'dealer' (who is a friend first and foremost luckily; i only met him after 2 years of clean time, we just go to the gym together) and asked him to stop selling to me; he said he was relieved and was worried i was gonna turn to shit again. Swore he wouldn't no matter what i said.
I can cold cop in open air markets here but the gear is usually awful and even in my peak of addiction id avoid it unless i had to.

Dont take your clean time for granted, i did and nearly fucked it all up. The battle isnt over either but im insistent on staying the fuck away from it. I nearly lost my sobriety from heroin, and in doing so risked everything that's important to me.

Lastly. If you don't have a job/career, have daily responsibility, no bills or on welfare or any kind of social situation where if u wanted to you could sleep in your living room for weeks at a time doing nothing and nothing will go south in your life, you have NO EXCUSE to not quit if that is what u want to truly do. You KNOW how to do it, but put saftey valves in place to allow urself to give in. Turn your phone off. Keep it off. Deal with the withdrawals , don't check your Facebook, don't allow anyway to contact or someone to contact u regarding using. Give your  laptop to someone or do whatever it takes to separate yourself from the people that will be your rope when your sick as a dog, depressed, and worst of all, beginning to let the user part of your brain plan a justified relapse. If you relapse out of just withdrawl , you need to get some professional help , as you don't want to quit, at least not enough to do it unsupervised.

The mods here do a great job of policing the bullshit but they shouldn’t have to!

My post on here helped me realize how much I was enabling him, and shortly after I gave him a 60-day notice to move out. I also did a walk through of the house (with our mom, who had been deep in denial). There were syringes everywhere and it was pretty traumatic to see how bad things were.

Anyway, the move out date (March 30) came and went. I didn't file an eviction because he did open up to our mom about his heroin use and said he wanted to get help. He went in for an evaluation and got state-funded insurance. He supposedly detoxed on his own at home and will be starting outpatient treatment. 

While there has been some progress, I am concerned he is not really serious about treatment and not totally convinced he is clean. He still refuses to respond to my text messages or calls, has not attended any meetings, and declined inpatient treatment even though he is eligible for it. He seems more concerned about people finding out about his addiction than working on his sobriety.

If you shoot up in a public bathroom, clean your shit please.","So I work in a chain drug store. The area around here is really rampant with heroin and other opiates since it's one of the more pure areas in the country and its pretty cheap.

I live in a bit smaller of a town, but I work in a pharmacy. We sell syringes to those who ask, and I don't have a problem because I am an ex-user or all different drugs so I know it's better to give them clean ones than to share or use old ones. THey are gonna do it one way or another, so I sell them.

Anyways, one night some undesirable looking people come back to the pharmacy, ask if there is a bathroom, and I tell them where it is. Immediately I know something is up, especially because at least 2 or more people came in for syringes right after another and that isn't a common occurence.

I go into the bathroom, I can't really do anything but a kid is in the stall, sitting, I hear a zipper and his pants aren't down.. so he clearly aint taking a shit lol. I leave and come back later to inspect the bathroom and I figured I would find some baggie, a syringe or cap or something.

I don't see anything, but then as I am about to leave I look at the toilet seat cover holder and THERES A FUCKING METAL SPOON IN IT!!

Seriously, what the fuck guys?! I've seen people leave cotton, caps, baggies, BUT A FUCKING SPOON? First of all the idiot is burning all of the fillers and bad shit into their solution and putting it in their veins.. but to leave a spoon man? Come on...

So I told my manager, the police were called and they inspected the videos and saw all of the people. They knew who the kids were ( small town), what car they were now in, who they were with and knew that they had drugs on them now. 

So basically, this kid not only disrespected society and other people by leaving his fucking drug spoon in a public bathroom, but ALSO made it that much easier to find him and his friends and bust them.

Good job!

Please... clean up your shit and be courteous to the rest of us, you're just making things worse and causing more trouble for yourself to get caught.

Thank you and be safe all.

Edit: I’m
Not understanding how it’s My fault that they left their shit there .
Somehow IM the bad person ? Seriously ?

Edit 2: man you guys are relentless . Maybe just don’t be stupid and be respectful and there wouldn’t be any problems to begin with ?
Edit 3: I want to make it clear that no one was arrested from this situation . They can’t prove who left it , they already were aware of who these kids were and all the info about them . This is basically a warning for everyone , yeah maybe i should have not mentioned the spoon but if I did this Then there are thousands of more examples just like this , I’m basically trying to tell you all to not do this shit or your running the risk of it happening to you and getting pinched

FINAL EDIT : ** You know what? It is my fault. You guys are right. I completely forgot that those in the middle of addiction don't take any responsibility for themselves and blame every one else for their problems and what happens to them. Never THEIR fault, they have an addiction! It's my fault he left anything there! It's my fault he shooting pills/dope in the bathroom and leaving a ton of residue of a random substance behind for some kid to find. It's my fault the police know who they are and what they are up to.

B - for pills or H, if I have time at home to prep, I will make little foil envelopes of pre crushed goods. Portion out the doses and fold them up into perfect little packets. Put them in my pocket and head back to said bathroom, open up, and use a rolled up post it note as a tooter.

I have prescriptions for everything I would test positive for, but I’ve been using dope (which would pop for opiates) but I have a codeine cough syrup prescription which would explain why I tested positive for opiates.

     I sit Starring at nothing and... but for a moment living the murky past.  The watercolor smudges of cumulative remembrance,  the eternal “rightness” of these life dreams.

Oddly and luckily enough, the last time my computer was in need of repair, I was invited to take it to BestBuy to have it fixed for free on my grandpa’s three-computer repair plan on which he had only registered one computer; and since I never decided to remove the BestBuy sticker with his name on it, my grandparents ended up informing me that they had received a call from the police department asking them if they had recently had a laptop stolen, as they had just come across one with his name on it during the execution of a search warrant, which confirmed my suspicion that I was lied to by my apartment management when he told me I didn’t need to worry about any police involvement and that they had indeed obtained a warrant that quickly. While they left the syringes, spoons, empty prescription bottles not in my name, and lots of other illegal materials, they did decide to confiscate all the foils, my bongs, pipes, about half of my remaining recently prescribed gabapentin out of the bottle (?), my fucking cat and his crate (????!!!!), and ALL MY KRATOM:(.

Does anyone know how long to expect before they’ll get an arrest warrant, or if they might even decide not to worry about it since they didn’t find any actual possession of narcotics? Does anyone know where my cat might be if he isn’t at the humane society or animal welfare, and if they’ll charge us anything to reclaim him being that he’s microchipped in my girlfriend’s name? Lastly, I was just approved literally two days ago for a new apartment but have only paid the application fees, and the $200 deposit to hold the apartment so it won’t be leased to someone else. All we still have to do is deal with renters insurance and make the pet deposits and can then presumably get our keys and start moving in out stuff and getting it out of the current apartment that we need to vacate by the end of the week.

Yet again had to go under the knife to do the entire surgery over again to fuse my entire spine. The second surgery left me with terrible chronic pain - developed fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, and severe athritis. 

Needless to say, im in pain management. The doctor who performed my surgeries saw me and gave me whatever pills I needed - vicodin, tramadol, percocet, valium, you name it. But by time Im around 21 years old, he tells me the pain im in makes no sense to him, isnt adding up due to my ""successful"" surgeries, and i dont need to be seen by him any longer. These fucking surgeries made me had to be home schooled in high school for two years because I was in sp much pain I couldnt get myself out of bed most days. I fought to get through my high school years, got through and was able to have a relatively normal college experience, and somehow a pain ridden fucking loser landed my dream job a year out of college. Its a physically demanding job and there is very little if any room for error. But heres the thing - im good at my job and I absolutely love it. Its given me purpose and has brought a new sense of meaning to my life (needless to say im a clinically depressed and anxiety ridden fool. All this shit will do that to a person) and while any other person in my shoes would pick an easier, less taxing on the body job, i cannot and will not do that.

So, Ive been in pain management for going on 3 years now. Started off on butrans patches along with 5mg oxycodone, celebrex, gabapentin, and tizanidine. After two years we got rid of the butrans patch because it just wasnt helping me anymore and i was left with everything else.... and my tolerance for the 5mg oxy is just laughable. When you've been on opioid pain killers since literally 11 years old and are now going on 25... 5mg is nothing at this point, but i know how almost impossible it is to get any sort of assistance or prescription overall from any damn doctor anywhere, whether you have chronic pain or dentist work or cancer or whatever the fuck! So believe me when I say I am lucky to get anything at all. I get 120 pills a month to take 4 times daily, but when youre doubling, tripling what youre supposed to be taking, 120 pills disappear in the blink of an eye. Got my script tomorrow, gabe my mom around 5, gave my roommaten 20 of them to stash and hide for me to dispense out to me when im out, and had at the rest of them. Took far too many to get through just two days of work and took way too many once I got home and could relax... and thats putting it lightly. 

Im frustrated. Im embarrassed. Im scared. Im hopeless.... I just dont even know what to do anymore. I have an appointment with my pain managment doc in aboit 3 weeks. My new insurance plan sucks and wont cover these appointments so im paying $300 out of pocket to get meds that my body has grown a tolerance for and dont do anything for me anymore. 

I guess im posting because i just feel like theres something fucking wrong with me and I feel far too dependent on these damn opioids... im 25 years old and am on the same pill regimen as my 79 year old grandma. I know I need my doses raised, but im terrified to try and address it and because of being so young, im scared of saying or doing any damn thing that would even remotely think of labeling me as a drug adict. But these drugs make it possible for me to work my dream job and have a somewhat normal life with my friends, family, and endeavors plus or minus some things. 

I don't even know what to do. Any advice or even just some positive vibes would be much appreciated. The pain has been so bad today that Ive been popping pills like m&ms, i havent been able to fall asleep and my alarm for work goes off in an hour and a half.

Thanks.",1523432272.0

I use the monkey water method with an oral syringe. So a large part of the IV ritual has already been a part of my use. I always measure out and write down every single dose along with the total at the end of the day. This is every day for the past year. About 10 doses of 20mg per day all tracked. Now I am very much considering switching to IV. My only worry is that I will eventually end up using a lot more than I anticipated and ""falling off the deep end"". But this worry only stems from what I've heard and read from others about switching to IV immediately being the worse decision to make. I do have faith in myself that's its possible. For a person like me, who's been able to use the same amount daily for the past year, is switching to IV and maintaining the same strict use schedule actually realistic and achievable? Or am I fooling myself?

EDIT: Thanks for the insight guys. Buddy had syringes at the ready but I managed to keep away for at least a little while longer. I've gotten the urge to switch a couple times now and I always tell myself to sleep on it first. Once again I woke up glad I didn't.",1523429070.0

I don’t wake up thinking about heroin, nor do I go through withdrawals.. but I do think about the girl who got me to use a lot. Codependency and all that. It’s stupid I know. I’m not a junkie or act like an addict, but is there a name for this phenomenon?

Dealer hits me up, sends the infamous “good come thru” text. My heart rate increases and my brain excretes endorphins. I swear this excitement is better than the high. So I hop in my car, run to the bank and take out 150 bucks for 5 blues. Damn could’ve gotten a nice pair of j’s with that money. Ah well, this shits way better. 

Driving to my dealer, fuck, why is my mom calling? ignore, it’ll be a lot easier to chat mom when I’m high. I continue down the road, he’s only 15 minutes away but I swear to god this always feels like hours. I take the right off the highway, and text him I’ll be there in 5. We all kno dealers, that’ll mean I’ll see him in 30. My phone vibrates, a text, maybe it’s him! Dammit, my mom,  “hey son, it’s my birthday! I kno u didn’t forget, 😝 just letting u know!” Fuck! I absolutely did forget. I’ve been withdrawing all day, only thing on my mind is getting high. Fuck it, I’ll still call her when I’m well, talking is difficult when I’m not. 

Boom, I’m in front of his house. Bout god damn time, shit felt like it took forever this time. I call, no answer. “Dude Im here, the fuck u at?”  I sit back in wait, scrolling thru Instagram, trynna keep my mind off my fiendish ways. Phone vibrates. Yes!

Ur moms blowing up my phone said you’ve been ignoring her?” I try to pretend like I’ve been sleeping. “Nah, just waking up whatsup?” She knows I’m fuckin a liar, but she has no clue that I’m a fiend, fuck no one days. “Hold up babe my mom is calling AGIAN” I click over

Adam is in his early 50’s. He’s short 5’5 and he’s disgustingly overweight 300+ pounds. He wears glasses cause he’s blind as a bat with his beedy little eyes. He’s a ginger. Has a raspy high pitched whiny voice. So there’s your description of him lol. Now I’ve met some junkies that are pretty fiendlike but Adam is in a whole other category. 

My boyfriend had known Adam from back in the OC days. Adam’s Dad was one of the biggest pill dealers around here. He got prescribed OC’s the real ones and other pills. I think he also got pills off the web idk but I’ve heard a lot about Adam’s Dad and how cool he was. Nobody knows why he is the complete opposite of his dad. Could’ve been cause he’s an only child and he’s spoiled rotten. His dad passed away years ago and left everything to him. He had a construction business that went to shit cause Adam is a lazy fuck. Basically he blew everything that was left to him and fucked off the business. He used to have an apartment but eventually lost that too cause funds ran out. 

I met Adam in 2016 when my boyfriend and I were in rough spot. We had to move out of my house cause it was being raised for floods and we had no car. My cars clutch blew and I couldn’t afford to get it fixed in a shop so a family friend said he would store my car and help fix it when he had free time. My boyfriend totaled his car. It was just a rough time. One day when we were staying at a friends house our friend Trevor came over. Trevor grew up with Adam and were best friends but it was more because their parents were close. Trevor told us Adam would help us do returns and give us a ride and we obliged. 

Anytime we’ve needed someone to do returns for us or whatever we break people off fairly and we aren’t stingy. Adam realized that, and immediately offered to let us stay at his place and he’ll do more returns for us yada yada. The least amount of work he had to put in to get high the better. We accepted his offer and needed showers so it sounded like a good deal. We pull into his apartments and it’s the same Senior apartments my great grandparents lived in that had just passed away that month. I knew Adam was older but not that old. He then mentions he lives with his mom. I knew how tiny those apartments were and started to regret accepting the offer to stay for the night. We don’t like being burdens on people or anything like that so I felt bad. We climbed the 3 flights of stairs and Adam is huffing and puffing. Surprised he never had a heart attack climbing those stairs. He introduces us to his almost 90 year old mother and I felt so much guilt then. The apartment had no room to walk. Adam’s belongings were everywhere. In the living room there was a small twin bed in the corner that we slept on that night. Adam rushes to his gaming corner. He has a desk with his tv and Xbox one. He sleeps in a Laz-e boy every night with his headset on, drool dripping down his chin, and his rolls hanging over the side of his recliner. He’s got paraphernalia all around his desk. He’s a smoker but still it’s wrong. His mom was so sweet tho. She really enjoyed our company. Her birthday was in a few days and she told me her whole life story. Adam treats her like utter shit. Video games and dope is all he cares about. His mom will try and ask him something and he tells her to shutup or he pretends to listen. My boyfriend and I are uncomfortable and just went to bed. 

So for the next two days we realized just how big of a piece of shit Adam is. He’s supposed to be taking care of his mom but doesn’t. She needed her benzo script filled and he hadn’t filled it in over a week! I eventually took the script and went to fill it myself because she was withdrawing and I couldn’t let it go unfilled for another day. Adam’s car was on a spare tire so we went and paid for a brand new tire on his car for him. We found out why Adam was procrastinating and wouldn’t take us to where we needed to go was because his moms social security check and disability check came that day. This motherfucker takes his mom to the bank cashes her checks and takes ALL the money. He had $750 and was searching for a quarter of black and a quarter of crystal. I was just flabbergasted that someone could do that to someone like their own mother. After he picked up his dope he went and bought himself a dab rig cause he liked dabbing after I showed him how. Then drove to the apartments and told us we could take the car and do whatever just bring it back. We went to the grocery store and my boyfriend got groceries. we remembered it was Adam’s moms birthday and she likes wine so he got her a few nice bottles of wine too. We went to drop the groceries off and filled the fridge up. Adam will literally go to the dollar store for groceries. The less money he has to spend on his moms necessities the more dope money for him. So sad. We gave her the wine and she almost started crying! She said she hasn’t had anything nice in a very long time. 

We didn’t end up staying in the apartment either we slept in Adams car for two more nights. I knew from my great grandparents living there that if the management finds out anyone that’s not on the lease is staying there then the tenants will get evicted. I overheard Adam’s mom worrying and asking Adam what they were going to do but I wasn’t sure what she meant at the time. Well two months later, I’m hanging with Trevor. He pulls up in a U-haul. I ask him what’s up with that? He tells me that he’s spent the last three days busting his ass packing and moving everything out of Adam’s moms apartment, while Adam sat on his ass playing video games. I guess Adam got his mom evicted. They were behind on rent and he wasn’t supposed to be living there. Adam told Trevor he would break him off some dope for helping too and when Adam didn’t Trevor lost it. So he proceeded to use the U-haul for two more days then returned it. I guess Adam and his mom stayed at motel 6 for like two weeks if that. Then they stayed in a shelter but eventually got kicked out because Adam was using. Last I knew, Adam and his mom were living in his little ass car. Dragging her around while he scores dope. Mind you, this was during December so it was freezing outside. I’m sure he was using in front of her too. Hella fucked up. His mom is definitely codependent and shit but she’s 90! She’s got dementia but in the early stage. She needs someone to take care of her. She won’t leave his side tho. ",1523419274.0

It got me thinking about how other then getting a couple hours Of sleep after we r completely exhausted. But other then that we all know during withdrawals sleep alludes all of us but I was wondering if anyone happened to know the scientific reason behind not being able to sleep.


It doesn’t make sense to me. Like every other sickness the human body goes through requires sleep and rest. It’s literally how and when our bodies heal.  But nope not during opiate withdrawals and I want to know why. 

I think i speak for all of us when I say if we could sleep through withdrawals we would prob make it through the w/d more often but alas we don’t have this luxury. 

So does anyone know exactly why this is the case? It sucks that on a normal non withdrawal day if I take even a crumb of a seriquil I’m OUT  for 12 hours and even groggy after that. When I’m sick tho I can take multiple full seriquil and maybe get 4 hours of sleep. 

The god answer is fuck you u did this to yourself now reap the consequences but I really would like the scientific answer as to why we are kept up during withdrawals he’ll if u guys can explain the reasoning behind any of the symptoms we go thru 
-RLS
-Diarrhea
-insomnia
-vomiting 
-anxiety 
-muscle cramps 
-loss of appetite 

If u guys know the scientific reasons behind these symptoms please fill me in!

I'm just reflecting this past weekend and the amount of money I spent in a three day period.

I've been on sub since January and  doing really well so I thought I'd treat myself for just one day (I always tell myself just one day but that never seems to be the case.) So my parents were in Florida last week and I could go to there house to use to avoid my roomate who I didn't want to nod out in front of.

Long story short I took my last 2 mg of sub Wednesday afternoon around two. Bought ten thirties for $350 and waited until around nine am Thursday to blow my first three.. Probably didn't wait long enough since I didn't feel much, but felt more and more as the day went on. I planned on getting back on the sub Friday but that quickly changed so after work I bought another ten pack (350). Went to my paremts empty house proceeded to nod out effectively after doing 8 total.

Again, planned on stopping Saturday but I had two thirties left.. I thought I should just sell them. BUT I  brought them to my half day of work on Saturday and  quicklyfound myself sitting on the toilet and crushing one up. Now I only had one left and knew it wouldn't get me through the rest of the day and didn't want to risk PWDs by taking sub so bought six more after work ($210).

Sunday came around and I took a look at my bank account and it hit me that I spent almost a g in three days ($910). Worth it? Definitely not Thursday, but I'd say yes for Friday and Saturday.

What's the most amount of money you've guys spent in a short amount of time and did you regret it? ",1523410836.0

I have a bunch of old school tales.  I will keep each post short.  So do your thing boys and girls and get ready.  Oh – everything in these stories are complete lies and fabrications or fiction.  One or the other.  I think, maybe ;).

The Boss – A Bad Mother
The boss of the house was Price.  Price was an old school N who was all about business.  He had rules and order to his house and he got his cut from EVERYTHING flowing through from steaks to pussy.  If you broke his rules, you were barred.  Simple as that.  Price’s house wasn’t a trap house.  It was more like a party house or a hang-out.  Old school we would call it an oil joint.  A place where you could buy or sell ANYTHING and either take it home or do it there.

Being white and from the suburbs, I liked the rules and order.  Price made sure that everyone was mostly treated fairly and as safe as possible considering the environment.  I could send my girl to the house without her being harassed or ripped-off.  It’s not that things never got out-of-hand, but mostly things ran smoothly.

Price rarely got beat.  The reason was the way Price handled himself.  If you messed with him, Price wouldn’t call or threaten you over the Internet.  He didn’t spray your house with women and children in it.  He didn’t get his boys.  He didn’t mess up your car.  Price took care of his business with his fists and boots.  People who fucked with Price were beaten – severely, old school style.  Not bitch slapped, not fucked-up, not ass whupped -- beaten.  He would do it himself, alone, or maybe take a white guy along so that he wouldn’t kill the man.  Price would break noses, blacken eyes and knockout teeth with one punch.  He would take out a knee or break an arm if he was in a bad mood.  Price didn’t need a weapon.  His rock-hard body was a weapon.  His hands were like grizzly paws.  He was a ferocious fighter, he was mean and he liked to fight.  One time he beat a man that he ran into in Walmart, right then and there, in front of his wife and kids.  Price was known for hurting men and that meant that few tried him and those that did regretted it.

Could I remove the coating and dissolve the tablet in water and dose volumentrially? I've heard oral (and plugged!) BA is awful, but I could drip the solution into my nose slowly.

I'm afraid of fentanyl presses like everyone, but I have test strips for it, so between that and a seller with good rep (and a non-infinite supply), I should be able to figure out if it's pressed and just toss it.


I have narcan on hand and would have someone with me for the experience. Anything you think I'm missing? Even though I have a bit of a tolerance, it's nothing like shooting H or fent, so I figured I'd start with miniscule amounts (like an 1/8th of a 10mg).

I could get two 8mg buprenorphine sublingual pills, the brand is called buprenaddict. (Those are supposedly without Naloxone in them.)
So they are supposed to be consumed sublingually, I'm taking from the name, lol. But is that the most efficent ROA - seeing as I only have 2, I'll have to be very efficent with them.

I'm thinking I'll try to wait as long as I can after my last H dose, then take half a pill and see if I'll get into a state from full on withdrawal to something managable.
Then I'm waiting... and taking the next half a pill the next time it gets really bad? How soon after should that be?
I'm not actuall sure exactly how to dose this so that I don't just take the subs for 2 days and then get the whole full spectrum of H withdrawal only 2 days later, lol.
My goal is to get clean with the help of these making WDs a little more managable, maybe then I'll be able to make it this time.
Or should I try to put getting more of those bupre pills on the top of my to-do list bc I won't get anywhere with just 2 pills? My plan here is not to get on sub maintenance and stay on it here, tho, so I only wanna be taking them a few days for sure.

I’ve read conflicting reports and thought I’d be feeling a lot worse, so I’m just curious if I should just continue this small amount of subs for a few days and just come off them or mix In some opiates?

Bad idea? Has anyone done this or had experience with something similar? Any feedback is appreciated. ",1523374053.0

My brother left Georgia in October 2016 as a walking skeleton. I had only seen him a few times in the decade prior, but this time he showed up looking thin and tired and somehow so grey and so yellow. He detoxed at our parent's house. 

He was also on parole, over H. However, he was clearly going to die if he stayed there. His Hail Mary throw was to board a plane and come back to MI. He showed up with a back pack. During the week, he realized he wasn't ready to go back to GA. He would use again. He called his parole officer to let him know he wasn't going back. His parole officer told him that would be breaking parole, but my brother never moved back.

Of course, my brother struggled during recovery. On my birthday, my Mom found a needle in the bathroom and my brother nodding off in his bedroom. There were slip ups. He made mistakes. I'm an alcoholic, so I know recovery isn't always smooth. Addiction is hard. But he was recovering!

My brother got a really cushy job! He gained weight! I found him a doctor that prescribed Suboxone, and now he is that same guy I remember from childhood. He still smokes like a chimney, but I believe him now when he says he isn't using. He has abused drugs for almost twenty years, but once I heard he was on opiates I was scared he would die. 

Anyway, my brother was back in my life. My family was complete. Then, when driving the car he was able to save up for (SO MUCH PERSONAL GROWTH!) he got pulled over for speeding in a school zone. The cop ran his plates and then took him to the county jail for GA to pick him up. GA wants my brother to go to court for violating his parole.

The county jail doesn't provide Suboxone, so my brother goes through withdrawal. He said it wasn't so bad, which was heartening.

I just felt so heartbroken because I finally got my brother back, and he was taking responsibility for himself, but this consequence of his actions still found him. I don't know how long he will be gone (he spent a week waiting for GA to pick him up), or what his punishment may be, but... I don't know. I'm mad he is being punished when he did what he needed to just to stay alive.

The good news, though, is that the lawyer thinks she can get my brother back to MI to finish his parole. I'm tired of waiting, though. I finally was able to enjoy my brother. We both have dogs we would take to the dog park together, and he would make jokes about the stuffy labradoodle owners. I miss him.

I don't know what the point of this post was, besides to purge my feelings. I'm sorry if this was the wrong place. I just love someone who got addicted to opiates after getting kidney stones.",1523373811.0

Those of you who posted in my previous post where I wrote about doing heroin for the first time (yesterday) made me throw it all away!

part1: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8b3c3k/just_did_heroin_for_the_first_time_advice_xpost/

Okay, so first of all I'll have to admit that I did it twice. But I've been having an intense feeling that this shit will fuck me up and get me completely addicted. Although it's so relieving; No worries and no problems. Even better with weed!

Earlier today I smoked it for the second time in the forest, alone this time, and then I simply decided ""Fuck it, I won't do this shit again, let alone buy it again."" and promptly threw my remaining dope on the ground. I've experienced it twice now, no need to continue. I don't think that the risk is worth the reward.

It was a nice experience, but I'll do myself a favor and stay off it. I don't want a drug to take complete control of my life. Thanks to all of you though, I wouldn't have thrown it away if it weren't for you guys!

I missed more than a year of school. 365 days of school. 

During these times the doctors perscribed opiate pain killers. 

I remember I was a troubled child, and taking those pills only made it worse. (Broken home, lack of love, abuse, you get the picture) 

I didn't realize during that time how much those pain killers did a number on my mental stability. I never got addicted, but they really fucked with my chemistry at such a vital time in my childhood. 

My high school life revolved around drugs. I'd drink alch by myself, to doing x alone. Smoked weed laced with meth (There was a batch going around in my city.) 

I tried to OD on the opiate pills once. It wasn't much, but I rememeber not being able to move and just sitting on the stairs of my house drugged up, alone at home. (I was usually alone.)

Out of high school I started messing with ecstasy again. I dropped a bad batch and it really messed with my mind. I was in psychosis for a few years after that. Formed a mild schitzo, massive anxiety, and a boat load of other mental instability. Because of this, I lost the only person that mattered to me at the time. ex gf of 7 years. 

I decided to turn my life around at this point and did.

My chipping got out of hand like 2/3 months ago, in that I was pushing 3/4 (and still am) nights of using a week. Last couple weeks I've had nights where I'm sniffing up to 7/8 points (granted it's not very pure, but still). Use for a couple days, feel great, then off, withdraw. It's not full blown or severe, but I'm literally detoxing essentially once a week...

I used last Fri-Sun. Spent pretty much all of yesterday sleeping, literally slept 14 fucking hours last night. Woke up for work, went in a complete haze. Mad chills yet I'm sweating, aches and bathroom trips every 45 minutes. Dissociated AF, look and feel like I'm severely hungover *and* decided to have a line of ket before work. It's seriously stupid, and very draining (combined with literally not having a **single** day off most weeks, I'm either at uni or working full time), but every time I decide to cop it and let my body groan. I feel better on day 3/4, have plenty of cash, so I decide to go pick up a half gram. Maybe I do the same thing the next night or two. Again, and *again*, and **again**. The dance continues.

A big part of me is definitely trying to put the brakes on, I know how fine a line I'm walking, and the only thing I've ever been somewhat pleased with my opioid use has been my total and utter refusal to use day-in, day-out. But honestly at this point this is feeling arguably worse.

Telling myself again that this week I will let myself fully detox and get my shit together. At least take a month before pondering my desire to chip. This shit is ridiculous. The money spent is ridiculous. But man that feeling of pulling up after the first fat line of the day is just so good :(

I feel stupid, shameful and just generally like I'm an embarrassment to my family and all the splendid mental help professionals that have supported me in the past. This isn't sustainable. Feelsbadman.

health questions presented to the forums daily, and *most* of us can only speculate. but if we had a mental health professional on the team, I think things could slightly improve. while I know there’s nothing they can REALLY do over the internet, they could definitely point them in the right direction. whether it’s online resources, or if general areas are shared, some googling could be done. & I think this could benefit a lot of people.

How are you doing? My life has been pretty insane. After a 2 week hospitalization that included 3 low-dose ketamine treatments I was discharged off of 0.5mgs of dialudid IV every 4hrs and 15mgs of oxycodone every 4hrs to an ultra small script of 30 5mg Oxycodone pills. My previous pain doctor wouldn’t see me because he’s getting out of the pain management business (to no fault of my own) and I hit withdrawals last week Friday prompting an emergency visit with a very expensive pain specialist. He gave me a two week supply of medication and told me to come back in 2 weeks and spend more money.

So, I followed up with an additional specialist covered by my insurance today and I don’t know how to feel about it. He immediately suggested I install a pain pump/spinal cord stimulator thing to which I politely declined. I've been through enough traumatic surgical procedures and want to hold off on this option for as long as possible.

Then he tried to put me on belbuca selling it to me as “for pain” and “not buprenorphine” he also gave me false information about how you could seamlessly transition from taking oxycodone to taking that without being in withdrawals first. 

I had to drive home the point that I had a seizure on buprenorphine in the past and was unwilling to take that without being under supervision first. To which he finally just increased my Lyrica dosage and switched me from oxycodone 10mg 3x/day to Dilaudid 2mg 3x/day saying it didn’t have the same reputation as oxycodone and not to drink with it.

I think I’m going to have to stay with this doctor though. He’s crap but he at least prescribed me something useful and he doesn’t cost $250 a visit wanting to see me every two weeks. He’s covered. 

I don’t know. Shitpost. At least I got something even if it is a 50% overall equivalency decrease. They give me the Dialudid in the hospital and it works well. So yah.",1523325378.0

I found an oxy connect and it was an infinitely better buzz.  We had a massive crackdown in my country on pills and the costs escalated and pills dried up.

Then I found opium. Morphine got me high every time, even though I had to escalate doses.

Then I managed to cripple myself spinally through sport, and was eventually prescribed oxycodine. Being an addict, I quickly raised my prescribed dose to 60mg a day, and I started abusing that to all ends. I was taking between 100mg-180mg a day. I would go through a month's script in 10-12 days. I'd go through WD, and then when the script was available again I'd jump straight on it.

But I found I can't get 'high' on oxy after a couple of days. No matter how much I took, I'd at best just nod out, but without any euphoria. I was swallowing all these pills without any pay off.

It was probably for the best because I no longer crave it, but it seems like I'm the only one this happens to. Oxy bottoms out in regards to the high once you've been an addict for a while. I've never done H, but morphine can seem to keep giving me a buzz if I take insane doses of it while oxy doesn't.

I took 130mg for my last dose last week and I felt nothing. In fact, I felt more depressed than usual. Does anyone else feel the same about oxy?",1523325283.0

8b3xd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8b3xd0/any_polydrug_addicts_here/,5,https://redd.it/8b3xd0,3nigma_,Any polydrug addicts here?,"Yo, I don't post often here but tomorrow I'll upload a pic of how #3 afghan H from the UK runs on the foil since I don't see that often on this sub. Anyway, I was wondering if there are any other poly drug addicts around? For those wondering what it's like I'll explain how it works for me:

Every day, I have what I'd call an itch. An itch to be high. This is a different kind of high though; It's simply a physiological change. What I mean is I crave for any feeling that'll deny me of being sober. Weirdly, I'm fine with being sober. I feel like I've been vague so far so I'll explain my drug usage now - I'm young and I live in the UK which has quite a large drug/rave scene for my age range which means every weekend I'll go out and get drunk with another drug added to the mix, usually ketamine since that's very popular in the UK. Every few months I'll do mandy and during festival season in summer I'll do a lot of pills. This is normal for most outgoing kids in the UK. 

For most people this stops on the weekdays but for me I find that I still need some sort of drug to get through. Coffee at this time is perfect. I'll have a bunch of mugs of coffee on the weekdays for about 2 weeks, and then I'll switch to caffeine pills for 2 weeks as my tolerance increases and then with a click of my fingers I'll stop consuming any form of caffeine (except for chocolate and a fizzy drink here and there). 

Next I'll crave weed and be the biggest stoner for the next 2 months, starting with joins then going on to blunts and then hitting bongs and then edibles etc.

Next I'll crave a different kind of drug. Maybe kratom. For the next month I'll take kratom daily like with the coffee and then one day I'd just stop. Next might be alcohol and those benders I'd normally just have on the weekends with mates turns into some vodka every night and again, with a click of a finger,I'd stop. The worst part is that every year I get depressed for about 2/3 weeks. This is when I fuck with hard opiates, namely heroin. Other than codeine the other opiates are very hard to come by in the UK even with DNM's so I'll smoke a lot of H like I have been recently and again, just like I did yesterday, I'll just stop. 

I've also done LSD a few times (bad trips every single time, will probably try again in a few years) and shrooms as well. The interesting part, however, is that every year there are times when I'm sober and I don't crave any drug. This is always the time when I have exams coming up or a deadline for work. I'll be so immersed in my work that drugs don't even cross my mind and when I complete that work to a high standard it's sort of a high itself. As a result, I've always done well in school and uni and when I complete uni I've already been offered a mid-level high-paying job. Leading up to this intense work time, I tend to turn into a bit of a 'junkie', chasing each high, getting more drunk than my friends, doing every high I could possibly get my hands on and just being completely reckless with my otherwise safe drug use. I feel like I'm constantly chasing highs which has worked for me so far but I'm worried about the future so I have a few questions for you guys (and I'd be happy to answer any you have for me):

1. Are any of you functioning poly drug addicts?
2. How do you deal with it? How do you scratch that itch?
3. How old are you (Doesn't need to be specific)?
4. Do you think I could keep this up? As of right now I plan on cutting off all of my hard drug usage when I start my first career-oriented job out of uni
5. Are any of you non-functioning poly-drug addicts and if so, where do you think it went wrong?
6. Are any of you addicted to one drug and do you have any advice / questions for me?

1. You take 5mg of combined Ativan, Clonazapam and Xanax in a 24 hour period, every day.  You take more clonazapam each day than ativan or xanax.  You have been doing this for about one year.

2. You have about 15 drinks of straight bacardi rum every day.  You start drinking at 6am every day, and you dont stop drinking till you pass out each day.  You have been doing this non-stop for five years.

3. You take about 120mg of oxycontin every day, over the course of a 24 hour period.  You've been doing this for about 2 years.

Today I met an old friend who's a heroin user, and since she knew the streets, I agreed to buying heroin together.

Now, I know that I probably sound like an ""idiot junkie"", but can't help it due to a ton of problems with me and my life. I'd rather be addicted to drugs and happy than abstaining from drugs and live in misery. My wish and goal though, is to do drugs in moderation. I don't really want to do drugs every day.

I met her, and we went to the drug dealing area with police at nearly every corner. We met a dealer that seemed pretty laidback, and she had bought from him before. We went to smoke it and I felt really good, relaxed and like my problems had just vanished away.

I just got home and still have the majority of it left(about 2-5 doses?), but I'm worried that this will lead to an addiction worse than weed, speed and alcohol combined. I'm really in need of some advice here and I'm not really sure what to do. How do I not get addicted? What should I do?

I've come across 2 12mcg sandoz fentanyl patches, I put the first one on my skin saturday around 7PM, the next morning I popped 9mg bromazepam and proceeded to have a jolly good day. Today I popped another 9mg brom and cut the second patch in half, put in inside my cheek for a while then chewed it, then nodded quite nicely pretty much all afternon, I mean I played a good deal of video games and watch a bunch of shows with my TV and PS4 not on... my tolerance for BZD and opis is pretty low these days.

I told him I could probably get a ride or take the bus even.. no response. 

I don't get it :(

So I wanted to pick up a g of ecp with a friend, it was my friends plug. I pick up the friend and we head to the dude about 30 minutes away, my friend isn’t talking much and just says hes tired, I think this is a bit weird but whatever. He asked me for the money before we pulled up which he never does, I park on the side of Taco Bell and he runs around to the other side to the dude. About 10 minutes pass and I’m starting to get nervous then all the sudden my friend pops into view and jumps in. He gave me my shit in foil and said be careful he couldn’t close the bag so that’s why it’s in foil. I’m like cool, seems like a lot and we take off. I drop off my friend and I go home, when I get home I dump the bag which is all powder into a mirror. 

(Some mini back story: I’ve given the dude 100 before and got a tiny bag with 3 rocks that got me and my girl very good for around 2 hours(prob fent). This dude doesn’t do it by point so I throw a number out like I want 100$ worth and that’s what I got. So I never know how much I’m getting, this is all thru my friend)

There’s a lot of powder and it’s more white then the last few times although it’s usually barely tan anyway. Well I’m chopping it up and my girl and I each do a line, starting to feel it, we do another, feeling good. Then I notice the powder is clumping it together and getting gummy. We try to smoke some and don’t feel anything, try to snort tiny hard rocks, doesn’t work. Tried to boof a decent amount and felt a little something for about 30 seconds then nothing. 

Ended up doing it all with only about 30 minutes of being high in total. Clearly it has some fent but what’s going on lol. Like it felt like someone took a .3 of dope/fent and mixed it with starch just to add up to a G. Makes me think my friend has something to do with it, like him texting the dude oh he’s about to spend 120 and he wants a g, give him a real weak bag and hook me up with the difference of good shit. The the 4 or 5 times before this it’s always been good but always looked tiny, my friend told me the dude does a g for 120, for 2 weeks I’ve tried to get a g and told he doesn’t have it or whatever.  Then this time it’s fine he can do it and I get a fat bag but it’s weak af. 

I give this friend rides to pick up drugs and I throw him money or drugs for helping me out when I need some and he helps. I think maybe my friend got sick of my asking for a g and told the plug to just give me a weak bag that’s big. 


Tldr; went to buy a g for 120, got the g and went home, got home to realize the bag was mostly just filler/starch, think my friend is cashing in on my misfortune ",1523298262.0

You may have seen me comment on here. Would love some input. I am 40 yo, was on opiates for most of my adult life. In 2015 got on subs, stayed on them for 2 years, then went to rehab to get off them (I tapered in that 2 years from 12mg/day down to 2mg/day) I just didn't want something ""controlling"" me anymore, so I got off the subs. Been clean about a year and a half now....
I'm seriously considering getting back on a low dose of them. Since being clean, I've been a wreck. Major bouts of depression, anxiety, and dealing with diagnosed bipolar disorder. I definitely didn't feel any of these negative chemical imbalances when I was on opiates (as long as I didn't run out and get sick) and definitely didn't when I was on the subs and had a script so I had them everyday. 

My friends think I'm nuts. Like the usual ""you worked so hard to get off that shit, why would you get back on it?"" Type of stuff, but seriously.... I have never felt worse in my life. I just can't seem to get my shit together mentally and physically. I don't sleep or eat right.... *AND its been a year and a half*

I recently made an appointment to see a psychologist in my area who is also a suboxone doctor. I dunno.... do you think it's foolish???.

I present this.

https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/mood-disorders/buprenorphine-improved-resistant-depression-outcomes/article/368764/

I'm actually going to see if he'll prescribe it for depression treatment, rather than addiction treatment (since I've been clean for a year and a half)

I don't know.... a few months ago I got a half of an 8mg strip from a friend (4mg) I broke it down to .5mg doses, and for a week, I felt great. Mind you, with such a low dose I didn't get *high*..... but I felt way better than I had for some time. 

Studies are being conducted and they are finding buprenepherine is great at treating depression *in low doses*

Left to his own devices, his own unmade decisions, particularly in moments of solitude, he felt the slight tug blossom into a uni-directional yank.

Not in any pre-determined physical direction, but in a jagged spiritual pathway towards that which would bring him the sting of danger and the warm gauze of release.

It wasn’t a release in the sexual sense, or even in the spiritual sense.

It was the sweet release of determination.

It was hand slamming on the reset button, beginning the timer afresh, a new bright clear morning.


He’d tell himself: 

It’s the dawn of a magnificent new struggle, begun with the shapeless warmth and gentle eyes of that fiendish old current welcomed back into his system.


The struggle was surely just one of simple mathematics:

One day on, One day off.

Or maybe Two days on, Two days off.

Or perhaps Three days on, Two days off.

Or why not eradicate the bun entirely –surely it could be wiped out in a day or two– and hunker down for the invisible journey that awaits on the other side?

Tear through The Ten with a spiteful urgency, a malevolent glee; Tearing, Chopping, Sliding, Breathing; Stabbing the Angel with a sharp inward current of wind; Stabbing and Stabbing again.

Until there’s nothing left to Tear open.

And It slowly awakes, bleary-eyed and hungry from Its bitter cold slumber.


Decisions have to be made:

To take action or to hunker down and hope that it passes over quickly and quietly.

No doubt you’ll feel the Angel’s cold breath in your bones as it passes; It knows you’re in there, hiding, quaking under your damp bedsheets.

How slowly will it pass? How close will It come? How much of It’s icy breath will surround your skin and permeate your being down to your sick marrow and helpless lungs?


The ever-present question:

How close will you allow it to come?

How close until you rise from your sweaty bed and take that first step on your quest to find the sacred blade that will gash the Angel back into its sacred slumber?

How proud that first step!

How exhilarating that wind-swept first swing of the blade!

How calm and clean, silent and warm those first moments when the Angel drifts off and you sense It’s softly dithering snore.

How delicately ritualistic those first few motions that follow your initial frenzied swing:

The tear

The chop

The slide

The breathe

The stab

The Five Points of the Glowing Star that resides deep in your chest.

Beyond the heart.

Beyond the breath.

Deeper than your bones.

Deeper than your blood.

Smaller than the cells that orbit throughout your system.

Less quantifiable than consciousness.

Less alive than death.",1523293039.0

8ayksh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ayksh/detox_plan/,4,https://redd.it/8ayksh,SixCylinder777,Detox plan...,"OK so long story. I've been a heroin addict for 11 yrs. 

A few weeks ago I came out of a 28 day treatment center and has tapered down to 4mg suboxone over the course of my stay (it was an intense taper) with the aim of dropping by 2mg a week. So after 2 weeks I'd be off... 

Anyway. I ended up leaving with a girl I met in rehab and moving to her city; I didn't wanna go home first so I bought only the things I had with me in rehab (so I don't have a phone or my wallet). I had convinced myself, well we had convinced ourselves, that we had fallen in love. 

Anyway. This girl has a connection that can supply her with infinite amounts of methadone, so to get some cash she encouraged me to sell my last few subs(the things that were gonna get me off) for some petrol money.. and that I could use her methadone, also her Valium, of which I am fully dependent on her for both these things. 

We didn't stay sober for long, for the past 3 weeks we've been doing dope and crack quite often, although not everyday however I've been taking 100mg+ of methadone and 20-50mg diazepam... 

Last night we got into this vicious argument about the last chip of crack, it ended badly and with her saying shes no longer gonna give me meds... but I made nice with her today, told her I loved her etc... and she's given me 500mg of methadone, it's not the last she's giving me she just said I must try make it last 3 days before she'll give more(she has an insane amount, I can see 3000mg but apparently there's a lot more stashed) but that's not what I want, I wanna get off being dependent on this woman and odd opiates LIKE I INTENDED to when I went in to rehab. I was so fucking close to getting off for good before I moved close to her... 

I said this in the last post but be careful of rehab relationships, when you're in there you're lonely and vulnerable, on the outside things change..

So, what's the quickest way(if possible) I can get off with methadone using 500mg.... remember I'm a heroin addict, only been on 'done for 3 weeks...

A little something crossed my mind this afternoon & I just wanted to get some feedback from our wonderful community.

As an opiate addict at some point you could quite possibly eventually have a run in with the law. Even at no fault of your own. It happens everyday, and subsequently as is notorious in the United States you will likely end up being required by the courts to take the old [piss test](https://imgur.com/a/ky10U). 

Myself included, I know most opiate addicts are really good people, but we are just totally slaves to our addiction for no reason other than we've fucked our brain chemistry up & we don't want to be sick. Fight or flight. It's not a character flaw - we're not fucking losers we literally have a fucking DISEASE. 

So where i'm going with this. If one of us, in the medical world, is legitimately diagnosed by a doctor as having the DISEASE OF **OPIATE DEPENDENCY** - shouldn't failing a drug test for opiates fall under the same category as being an issue that manifest itself from the disease?

I understand opiates are unfortunately illegal the way some of us take them. Even if we hate it, and want to be opiate free we are chained by the illness.  My question is, if someone was in recovery, and genuinely trying to fight their disease - wouldn't failing a drug test for opiates just be a symptom that results from the disease?

I know the courts are about 100 years away from even considering seeing it this way, but honestly could this logic be used as a defense if you were to find yourself fighting a positive drug test? I'm not sure I've explained myself well enough, but you guys are smart & can hopefully understand where I'm going with this. What are your thoughts?

Edit: And honestly on this same tip - How can jails deny you legally prescribed Suboxone if you or a family member brings it in correct container? I mean these are supreme court level type questions.

My doctor recommended me for suboxone a couple of days ago for Kratom withdrawals. You read that right. We don’t need to go into how absurd that is here, because it’s usually the other way around.

However, I’d like to know about what exactly it is. For someone who is not severely addicted to opioids like myself (the withdrawals exist and they aren’t fun, but id say it is not physically sickening like I know heroin or most of opioids have) would suboxone have the potential to make one feel “high?” I know buprenorphine is a very potent chemical, and with my comparably low opioid tolerance, what would, say, 2mg feel like?

Thanks all, I’m just curious as to what suboxone really is, because it seems to occupy a different space than most all other opioid drugs. I’m not going to go get a script and start getting high off of it just because you guys say it’s possible.",1523208168.0

Rick's lips were blue and he was drooling a red froth from his mouth, like red foam.  I was a lineman and the company made everyone pass Red Cross First Aid, so I was trained to call 911 first and then start CPR.  The new CPR is two emergency breaths followed by 100 chest compressions fast and hard and repeat until help comes.  Rick is a big man so I had to  straddle his big belly to start CPR.  Rick starting breathing with that rattle breathe, but only three breaths / minute.  Finally Fire and Rescue comes and they asked me what he took, which was two 80s, a bar, a dub and half a bottle. They hit Rick with NARCAN and took him to hospital.  Rick died the next day.  The cops called me and asked questions, but I was at work and had an alibi.

About 20 mins ago I made a small switch in the order of the steps I take to prep my shots and I think it left me with a slightly more potent shot (I'm kinda nodding typing this so it definitely did the trick), which inspired me to ask about switches others have made.

In the past my method has been putting the dope in the spoon, squirting some water in, applying some heat, mixing, filtering (cotton) and shooting (More minutiae than that but not especially pertinent atm)

Tonight my first step was putting water in the spoon, heating it, *then* throwing the dope in, followed by mixing etc.

I'm not the best at slowly heating and in the past I know I've reduced potency by overcooking. Heating the water a lot, letting it cool juuust a little then adding the product meant that if I happened to draw up fewer mls before shooting that difference could be attributed to **just** water evaporating, not product along with it.

Not applying heat with the smack in the spoon also forced me to be a little more patient while the H was dissolving - I mixed it a bit then set the spoon down, got ready for night nodding (brushed teeth, prepped netflix), came back, stirred a little more then filtered and shot. I've always heard folks say cold shots are superior but I've never been patient enough for that - I feel like this is a happy medium :)

I'm always open to suggestions for enjoying my tar the best I can, so what do you guys do in your prep process to improve your shots?

I have been IVing Heroin for years so I do have a decently high tolerance.
Lately, all the stamp bags going around my area have been fentanyl. 
No matter how many bags I shoot, I can't catch a nod.
It's feel a great rush and feel good for a little bit or wake up in cold sweats from getting hit with narcan. 
My friend, who has about the same tolerance, will do the same amount and he is nodding hardcover. 
What's up with me?
The only time I can catch a small nod is when I mix it with Xanax which I never recommend doing.

Sure, after 30 days at 800mg of codeine (Schedule 2) you'll be more physically dependent than at 200mg a day (schedule 4). But this completely fails to take in consideration that noone gets prescribed 800mg day to start, and you're not more likely to get psychologically addicted at all. The effect of drug schedules is that users are punished different amounts for same crime, and not to mention that the actual classification of drugs into the schedules is horrific!  

Lets take a look:

Schedule 1: (No medical use)
Dope,
PCP,
LSD (all hallucinogens),
Cannabis,
Synthetic Cannabis,
Meth (Even though it clearly has a medical use listed as a schedule 3)
GHB,
Morphine,
Shrooms,
MDMA

Schedule 2: (Medical use but high potential for abuse)
Addy,
Carfent,
Fent,
Methadone,
Hydrocodone,
500mg of Codeine,
Dilaudid,
Oxy

Schedule 3:
Ketamine,
Morphine under 50mg
Meth

Schedule 4:
Xanax,
Valium (most benzos)

Schedule 5:
Codeine under 200mgs

Drug schedules don't keep doctors making safe prescriptions?!? They don't protect the public from being prescribed dangerous drugs, they value punishing users for having larger addictions and flat out deny medical uses and contradictions in their schedules. Potential for abuse is NOT = measurable impact of physical dependence after prescription is consumed.

Ever since I've used almost all of that kratom, usually in high doses and redosing several times when I use (not opiate naive, assume using starting on kratom the day after first time with h skyrocketed my tolerance). 

Went back to my apartment for a day recently, binge smoked some more h over the course of an evening and woke up with a hangover from hell, was throwing up, had a headache and couldn't keep food down without it coming back up for a solid few hours. Left the h and rest of the kratom at my apartment so I don't get tempted. Got some bars and went back to stay with family over the holidays. First night I had 2 bars (fucking delusions of sobriety) and slept for hours, second night just one bar and ended up sleeping for almost 14 hours(?!?!), got out of bed at 6pm (yikes), waking up sweating like a pig a few times during the night, and have had fucked up body temperature since. Tonight I think the plan is to have half a bar and a couple beers so I can wake up early and meet some mates at the pub.

My question is, have I managed to develop a physical dependence to kratom already from using it in such high doses (10-25g) almost daily? Won't have access to any opiates for another month so if so I'll have to just deal with it, got 5 bars and plenty of street speed on hand to regulate sleep cycle tho.

I fuckin love to get high on pain killers.

I’ve only tried mostly mild prescription pills, Codeine, DHC, Tramadol and some morphine and oxy use. 

I am prescribed 100 X 30/500mg codeine/Paracetemol every 20 days for Lower back pain. This has been going on for about a year. However this 20 day supply barely lasts 48 hours. By the second day I have CWE’d the pills and consumed all 3000mg  usually in 5 doses. 

I’ve heard the stories of codeine having a ceiling dose at 400mg but I do notice a difference between 400 and 600. 
Anyway. My problem comes from the residual paracetamol left after the CWE. No matter how many times i filter or what material I use to filter I still get a residual amount which would be totally safe if I didn’t take 1500mg of codeine each day. 

I have overdosed on paracetamol a few times, once resulting in hospitalisation. I explained I take a lot of cocodomol and paracetamol for my back pain and they werent suspicious even giving me IV morphine at low doses for my pain while In hospital. 

I was wondering if I asked my doctor to put me on something stronger what his first response would be. Tramadol isn’t an option because I puke hard. 

Bearing in mind this is the NHS I’m dealing with and they are strict with opiates. 

Obviously I won’t tell the doc I’m taking half the box and CWEing them. 

I’m using OTC codeine syrup and DNM oxy pills on top of the script Most days.

It started about 6 months ago when I went off my antipsychotic meds in order to elimate negative side effects . (I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder) In the process of getting off the meds I lost my mind and tried herion. Biggest mistake of my life.

Long story short now I'm at a point where I'm smoking over a gram per day just to keep from getting sick, I don't get high off it anymore. I would have started shooting it a long time ago but knowing me once I do a shot I'll never come back from that . I go into severe withdrawal every 4 hrs if I don't smoke and it gets really bad really quick. Freezing cold, sweating, vomiting, muscle cramps, the whole bit . The worst part is it makes me start having a panic attack so I'm unable to breathe/hyperventilating while crying and shaking.

I've tried methadone and it really doesn't help me as much as it seems to for others, and I don't want to become addicted to that next .

I'm planning on taking suboxone and xanax which has helped in the past but I know it's still going to be torture.

The part I'm most worried about is my mental health. I feel myself starting to go into an episode and completely lose it. I feel like I will become so suicidal and generally screwed up in the head urging the process of withdrawal that it's going to trigger me to go into a state of mind I won't be able to come back from for a while. I haven't had thoughts of self harm since I was 15, and I found myself waking up and burning my leg with a lighter last night I couldn't stop myself whatsoever. I felt so dissociative and far from reality that it scared me. 

Does anyone with mental illness have experience getting off opioids? Are these feelings only going to last through the whithdrawls or am I going to lose my mind for a while?

I'm so scared of the mental aspect of my withdrawals that it's making me want to give up and kill myself . Any help or advice would be appreciated I really don't know what to do or what's going to happen",1523088525.0

Goodbye Heroin,

It hurts my heart, we have to part, 
But this is for the best. 
You filled a hole, inside my soul, 
And I’m sure you know the rest.  
My life you took, my world you shook, 
Now I’ll never be the same. 
And you were worth, my time at first, 
But you played me like a game. 

The shit I did, is no way to live, 
So I’ll have to say goodbye.  
I hurt my friends, and in the end, 
You made me want to die. 
You lied to me, you said you’ll be, 
The best friend I ever had. 
When you were gone, your warmth I longed, 
I realized you were bad. 

I finally knew, when I craved you, 
That you would cause me pain.  
I stole so much, to get your rush, 
I needed you in my veins.  
You took my life, and made it nice, 
Then you had to mess it up. 
I crashed my cars, and tried so hard, 
But never could I stop. 

I made my choice, but lost my voice, 
I couldn’t ask for help, 
You caused me harm, scars on my arms, 
You watched me as I fell.  
If only you knew, that I am through, 
Maybe you’d leave me alone.  
There’s things I’ve lost, due to your cost, 
My morals, my friends, my home. 

By putting you first, there’s people I’ve hurt, 
Now I realize you are shit.  
So this is the end, my dear old friend, 
It’s over, I’m done, I quit.",1523092992.0

[shytpost extraordinaire - no proofreading just hitted send],"I'll keep this short. I was asked for money today in exchange for roxies from Cliff's script, to be available today within an hour of providing cash. It was due to an insurance change. Basically the insurer was willing to cover a 7 day supply for 2 per day but was not willing to cover the month until next month when the authorizations came through and shit.

&nbsp;

In the mean time the script would cost $210 for the full month. Cliff already owed me four because I loaned him cab money knowing full well that I'd get the 4 when today came. Due to this unforeseen scenario I would either say ""fuck it, you wait and I'll wait"" or pitch in further. So ultimately I lowballed, I said ""I have $120"" so that I wouldn't clean myself out and have money to use for the week ahead. Cliff did ultimately make up the difference with the aide of a friend form out of state who visits our City every week. After a transfer and a visit to the bank via cab, Cliff went right to the pharmacy. Even gave me three extra in addition to the amount he gave me for the money I provided. Normally I'm given two extra for free due the effort I make in picking it up for him and because that's what a cab would cost.


&nbsp;


So now, no pressure, I can do whatever I want at this stage. I had a good day, my turtle polished off the bottle and I had a great day at work. 


Cliff made a fairly generous conditional offer.... Should I take it? I'm already leaning towards not but in the time it takes me to eat this pizza, maybe one of you will chime in and change my mind.

&nbsp;


Cliff said that he will give me two more free roxy 15's if I show up at his house before work tomorrow afternoon and show him that I have two roxies left in my bottle. **What would you do? What would you recommend I do?** Some might ask, ""what should I do?"" Should is such a subjective word, and many of us don't do what we *should*.""


I have two left right now and am leaning towards consuming them after I eat right now If I do that, then tomorrow I'm taking a sub if and when I feel physically, emotionally and/or psychologically compelled to do so. **Let's be honest, I'm ripping these pills in the form of lines after this pizza... still I'm open to suggestions if anyone beats my timing.**

&nbsp;


**TL;DR:** Started today with 15 roxies (15mg) and if I don't finish the last two and show those two to Cliff tomorrow afternoon before work, he'll give me two more for free.


&nbsp;

**P.S.-** In conclusion, I consumed I didn't save any so today I get to take subs if I start to feel funky but at the moment I feel sufficiently well since my last dose was about eight hour ago. This means that it might not be too soon but it probably is too soon to take a sub and it's never worth finding out that it is too soon. 


Was it worth it? Well, I was already due 5, 6 if I picked up the script so it was nice getting 15 but I didn't do a great job conserving. Even when I had the power to conserve, I tried running a derby to finish and here I am. 

To answer anyone's question, I think that maybe Cliff would've given me two free pills if I saved and then said ""hang out with me tonight since I was so generous"" or something like that. Maybe it's a bribe to increase the likelihood that I hang out with him because he did offer me a couple of bumps for after work. Either a couple of pills or bumps, not sure which but it's inconsequential if I have other plans tonight. ",1523086051.0

I'm wondering if I could wear some kind of symbol to indicate that I've got it, just in case someone needs it and is looking for it. I tried doing a search on this, but so far without luck. The only idea I've gotten so far is to fashion a recognisable mockup of the Narcan logo, maybe about 10 cm across, as a shoulder patch.

I also wonder if it's a good idea or not. I can't really imagine anyone wanting to mug someone for Narcan, but I admit I do wonder if that's a risk.

 I have been taking adderall and Xanax for the past few months pretty regularly.  It's been pretty consistent. I don't know what to do.  Should i call them and tell them the truth? Should i take the test and they can see the results?  Should i try to see a psychatrist to see if i can get them to prescribe those meds (i have an appt Wednesday an hour away and have to pay 250 up front)?

A good friend of mine underwent an operation and was prescribed oxy and antibiotics to help with pain and fight infection. Friend got the pills mixed up by accident and took two doses of Oxy by accident and we think he overdosed; he doesn't know how long it was until afterwords but later he took Narcan to reverse the effects and he says he's just gonna take Narcan as needed until he doesn't need it anymore. what do, should he continue what he wants to do and not go or should he not risk it and go, he was having trouble breathing after he first took the oxy but he isn't anymore. I should also mention he isn't an adult and is in his teenage years, i'm not sure if that changes anything tho

He went in Monday to get the results and apparently got some really bad news, and then killed himself Tuesday.   Some of my coworkers are speculating that results either showed liver cancer or hepatitis B.  Won’t get the autopsy results for a couple weeks.  I would think he committed suicide so he didn’t have to feeling the pain that was gonna come.  Also, does anyone know if you can take opiates when you have a fucked up liver?  What can they give you for the pain if your liver is that badly damaged?

8afgsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8afgsw/nose_not_absorbing_suddenly/,7,https://redd.it/8afgsw,bratzdfff,Nose not absorbing suddenly,"This may be a tolerance issue, but pretty abruptly it seems like my nose is just not absorbing the h I snort. Nothing has really changed; the dope is pretty much the same as it was a week ago. Also I have not been snorting long term- I moved from the west coast to the east coast 3 months ago. Out west I was smoking tar, and when I moved I took 2 months off from opiates. I have only been snorting for a month so I don't feel like i have done any major damage. My nose physically feels fine and there are no scabs and no bleeding that I have detected.

Anyone have any idea what could cause this? Although my nose doesn't feel clogged, I am thinking there is a chance that whatver non water soluble cut has accumulated and coated the blood vesels to some extent? I blow my nose semi regularly (not to the point where my nostrils are completely empty so that the powder flies right through into my throat, but still a fair bit), but maybe a full on flush with saline would be in order?

If I can't sort this out its either sober up or start IVing. I don't feel ready to end this run, but I know that returning to IVing would be a horrible decision. I IVd hydromorphone for half a year 4 years ago when I had an amazing plug, and while the high was great, the  lifestyle was destructive. Not that snorting/smoking aren't horrible ways of life, but IVing feels like a differnet ballpark. The temptation is there though- like I said I don't feel ready to end this run and any addict knows how difficult it is to sober up when you don't actually want it.

Has anyone encountered this type of issue with failure to nasally absorb drugs? Or do you think its just a pretty abrupt tolerance spike? I have upped my dose but so far its been futile so I am thinking its the former. ",1523071740.0

I have five 8mg subutex. I tried a few searches on google and on r/opiates and couldn't find a taper chart for subutex. 

I've done subutex before (one 8mg pill would last 3+ days) and figured I wouldn't need to do a full 8mg/dose to stop withdraws.

My tolerance to dope depends on my setting of where I'm using. At home where I am most of the time, I can do up to a gram per day. When I am using outside of home (dad's house, movie theatre, restaurant, etc.), I can do .2 and nod out without realizing. So I'm not positive as to where my tolerance is at.

If anyone can give tips or experiences with tapering short-term, I would appreciate it. I am looking for the least withdraw symptoms possible, so it doesn't have to be a 7-day taper, but not looking to do month long tapering as I only have 40mg of subutex.",1523070814.0

I had coffee on from earlier and chugged 24oz with my wife because I didn't wanna nod out on these. I just thought I was being a bitch or my tolerance was low be ause of the break but nah We were right.

I get the remaining 4 face the M's in one direction, turn them over and the score's and the number 30 are all in different spots, nothing was identical.

Fuck man I could have had a really fucking big problem.

8acqfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8acqfo/ugh_another_dboy_got_raided/,7,https://redd.it/8acqfo,rickersjun,"Ugh, another dboy got raided...","So I posted something about a month ago about my dope boy giving me the run-around about delivering to me.  I waited all day and night and he wasn't able to make it out that night.  He did swing by in the morning and delivered to me though, which was great. I found our a day or two later though that the reason he was unable to get out here was because his spot got raided that afternoon, and most of his people got popped too.  Pretty sure it was mainly because the crackheads and prostitutes he had selling for him were unreliable, flaky, morons who were far from discreet or careful about their behavior.  Always yelling and screaming at people they had problems with directly OUTSIDE the trap, calling tons of unnecessary attention to their operation.  Why my old dboy chose to continue having those dipshits handle business for him, I don't know, but yeah...his lack of caution got him busted, which sucks.

So a few days after he got popped, I walked around that side of town and was able to cold cop.  Found a chick who was willing to take me to the spot she hustles and tricks out of, and I quickly became a regular there.  Was out there yesterday and only had $10 to drop, but got what I needed quickly and left.  I don't like hanging around for long when I cop there because of the lack of caution that that hooker practices is just plain awful.  Always freaking out and being loud, yelling, fighting with addicts and johns, and just plain engaging in super hot behavior.  

So today I was psyched because had some decent money to spend and I got a ride out to the spot.  Had my Uber driver drop me off a block away and walked to the trap, only to find that someone was pulled over like two houses down from the spot and had multiple cruisers at the scene.  Pretty sure it was the plug. Asi walked by, I saw the hoe walking up to the trap house (within sight and earshot of the cops) and yelling up to the doorman super loud about so-and-so getting busted.  I walked on by and grabbed a cup of coffee from a local coffee shop, then casually walked past the trap house to see that the car that had been pulled over was gone, but the cops were now all parked at the spot and were apparently raiding the place.  So frustrating!

So again, because of lack of caution and care, I lost another connect.  What I don't understand is why dope boys continue to put their freedom in the hands of unreliable crackheads and prostitutes.  In my experience, most dope dealers I have gotten to know over the years are far from stupid, and are typically very careful.  So why the hell do they continue hiring flakes like these asshats?  If it were me, I'd only hire people with even tempers and calm demeanors.  Then again, I'm sure those kinds of personalities are few and far between.  

Anyway, this was just a post to vent about the ineptitude of dealers and their associates in my area.  I was able to cold cop a FIRE ass 20 bag of boy from someone else in the neighborhood (all she had was a 20 unfortunately,) but was wanting to get at least a half.  But hey, at least I was able to score SOMETHING and didn't end up getting popped for possession.  

Now it's time to do a nice shot of this fuego.  :)  Stay safe, everyone!",1523045848.0
8acndc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8acndc/wits_end_with_chronic_pain/,18,https://redd.it/8acndc,Cr0ssRo4ds,Wits End with Chronic Pain,"Sort of reaching out to any other members on here who also have chronic pain.  I am to the point where I have struggled with suicidal thoughts from pain for about 4 years straight almost daily.  This is the only problem in my life.  (Suicidal ideation is probably a better term.  I've never been close to actually ""doing it"" nor am I at the moment.)

I'm also very young.  The only time I can really get scripts is from post op procedures.  I white knuckled through the pain for so unbelievably long, not even taking pills after major surgeries... not once.

In early 2016 I started using kratom.  Still never touching one pill from scripts I started accumulating in 2009 when I was a young teenager from surgeries/broken bones.  My only opiate experience prior was IV in the hospitals... but imo there is something different about consciously choosing to take a substance verse in the hospital, even if it is more intense.  With the kratom I thought, *""Wow... this REALLY takes the edge off my pain""*  My depression subsided a lot.  I would only take kratom before work where my pain was the worst.

Late 2016 early 2017 my pain gets worse... I successfully complete another hip surgery (#2, first one on other side), get another script, still don't take it.  Stick to kratom and weed.

My main issue and what always has been is low back pain.  I thought it was because I was fat... so I dropped 100+ lbs.  Then maybe it's my posture?  Spent months correcting it.  Poor flexibility/core strength?  Worked my fucking ass off and am considered ""flexible"" when doctors examine me now.  Physical therapy?  Over 100 sessions.  Acupuncture /chiropractor?  Tried it.  Yoga?  Tried it.  Prescription NSAIDs?  Tried it, cortisone injections?  Ya ya you get it by now.

My first hip surgery was a failure, and they are refusing to do another one.  They literally told me to just wait **""A COUPLE YEARS** for stem cell treatment.  I'm sorry but that is horse shit.  1 minute in 10/10 pain feels like a couple years.  I strongly believe I have referred pain to my low back from my hip and if I could just get my damn hip fixed my back pain would go away.  Lidocaine diagnostic proves that at the very least my hip pain is sourced from my hip.

Anyway March 2017 rolls around, out of my mind and wanting a couple hours of no pain I finally pop 20mg worth of oxy.... *""ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I'm finally free.""*  I musta had 300 of these 5mg percs and went through them in about 2 months.  Eventually needing to up the dose and begin wasting them with CWEs.  

I go from May - November again relying on kratom... but fuck am I miserable and in PAIN.  November I see my surgeon again telling him how much pain I'm in, and he hesitantly gives me 5 5mg percs.  Not without a 45 minute discussion about me taking place outside the room and just this look of ""You freaking junkie.""  (They actually asked me if I was WDing from that script when I saw them again 3 months later lmfao).  I'm sorry but that's an insanely small script.

So December nothing but kratom, January this year I begin occasionally getting loose ms-contins when a family member had extra, by February that dried out, so nothing in February.

Here's where I began imo possibly overdoing it.

March I get a Panda connect with 0 opiate tolerance.  This is where I began snorting.  I could get a solid 4 uses out of a pill at first, but they're so potent my tolerance shot up faster I guess, I needed half.  Well that dried up (thank you FDA) so back to percs.. only this time I need something like 3x the dose of when I had no tolerance....

Basically I see where this road is heading... but I'm in SO MUCH PAIN!  This pain rn is so much worse than any surgical procedure I've had, any bone I've broken, I'm losing my mind right now.  I think I've spent $1k in the past month and part of me is seriously considering just going down this path to hell until I hit rock bottom and check out.  Because seriously what is the point of life when you're holding back tears 24/7, can't work, can't go out with friends, can't enjoy life.  These are supposed to help ""manage"" pain, but I can't help but take enough that it ""kills"" my pain.

I don't really know the complete purpose of this post, maybe I just needed to vent.  Basically almost everybody I know is really ignorant on the topic of drugs and if I confide in them about the pain I'm in and how I'm currently managing it I will get shunned as there are too many mutual friends who are dead as a result of opiates.

Fuck... I'm assuming post people in this subreddit are going through some type of pain, physical, emotional, or both.  I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it all away.  

Oh and it's not withdrawal pain or anything... but I think at my current dose I'm probably 1-3 weeks away from serious dependency beginning if I continue using.",1523045180.0

Tomorrow will be a week off of methadone. When I quit I was on 90mg liquid, once daily.

The first couple days weren't too bad, but it's gradually getting worse. These withdrawals are nothing compared to heroin withdrawals that I've gone through before, but the restless legs, muscle spasms, and over all depression and a sense of impending doom has been crippling. When can I expect to feel normal?

I've been taking excedrin for muscle aches, and I'm not gonna lie, I've been taking alot of Nyquil just so I can get to sleep. It takes hours to get to sleep but once I do I sleep for a solid 8-10 hours. I wake up extremely depressed and I have been getting chills and cold sweats. I thought I'd try to muscle through it and take long walks outside (I walked for over 3 hours today) but by the time I get back home I'm very sweaty and I feel like I have a fever.

I've been living in a sober living house for the past seven months, after a month in treatment. When I first moved in, people on subs or methadone weren't allowed in at all. About two months into living at the house, cravings and all that got bad, and everything I was doing with my sponsor and the steps left me feeling like I still might slip back into H. So I started buying subs from a dude I used to sell to back in the day, and taking a quarter or so of a sub a day.

It helped, like, a lot. I got involved in the recovery and sober living community in my area, worked with my sponsor productively, gained respect at my job and with my family. Things were going well. Hell, looking at the big picture, things still are going well.

See, my sober house is chartered under a nationwide organization of sober houses, where each house is mostly autonomous as long as some very basic conditions were met. My house meet those conditions my whole time there, but a few days ago, some people from the state and local parts of the org used false pretenses to sit in on our weekly house business meeting, where we discuss bills, rent, chores, etc. 

They came with the intent to intimidate and railroad us, and that's exactly what they did. They drug tested the whole house, which in retrospect was not even their prerogative to do. Obviously I popped for subs, and another guy for alcohol.

So I've been sleeping in living rooms and cheap motels for a few nights, and it's sucked, but I've been making it to work and all that, and now I can look for a place to rent with a friend. I've already got an appointment with a sub doctor on Wednesday so I can go legit. My sponsor has been really understanding and supportive. I haven't gotten high, and I don't see subs as a relapse, despite what a lot of the recovery community says. I know my motivations.

And to be honest, I stood in front of the beer cooler at work for a minute there other night, and I could go score now. And if I agreed with the""recovery people"" that I've already relapsed with subs, I probably would have gotten drunk or high by now.

So I just needed to write this out while I'm eating McDonald's and charging my phone to remind myself that things look a little fucked right now, but I'll best serve myself by not giving in and proving those busybodies from the sober house state org right.",1523035209.0

For some background, I’ve been on maintenance for close to 2 years now and for the majority of that time I was taking Suboxone, recently due to issues that I won’t get into I had to switch centers and after a lot of research I decided that Methadone would be the best bet for myself going forward.

During the switch between centers I had to wait about a week due to the new place not being able to take on a new client on short notice. During those 7 days I was using full agonists again to stave off withdrawals until I could start MMT. It has been 5 days now that I’ve been on methadone (currently on 50mg and going up until I can make it a full 24 hours without going into w/d) and as of now I feel like I made the right choice, however I have 90mg of oxycodone left from the week in between centers. My question is simple. Would I be able to get any benefits from taking the oxycodone while on methadone or would it be a waste? I just want to know if I’d be better off flushing them or taking them.

if i add 70% isopropyl alcohol to the tooter and let it dry on foil, will this waste any of the crack cocaine residue/resin/whatever you wanna call it? i've heard of people cleaning their H tooters like this. do I need to let the alcohol dry for a specific amount of time (smoking isopropyl alcohol could be deadly im sure) or can I just light it on fire and then dry the remaining product (say with a hair dryer, carefully, or by leaving the foil on a windowsill for a couple hours or over night) and smoke without problems?

(im high and sleepy but lets get philosophical),"i.e. street prices or higher

in theory i believe that most peoples addictions would end sooner .

prices continue to go up for pills

people beginning to charge $2/mg for pills.

and i don't blame them, i would too.

its pretty much the end now until a new beginning . what is the next phase? thats what i want to know
when fent is gone and its analogs
are rcs are unimportable
and people cannot afford $40 roxys
i think something is going to happen
something beneficial for people that like opiates
the govt. cannot ignore a signifigant percentage of the population that enjoys something so much that it puts a strain on their infrastructure

drugs should have never been made illegal, drugged driving sure, or acts comitted while on drugs should be an extra penalty and not a subtraction unless they are found to be  psychiatrically ill.

the government and our world wants to control every last thing that we do

from the food we grow down to what we eat and what we can view on the internet


the media is nonstop fearmongering propaganda and i have really about had it if i had the money id move to a country a little bit more sane. yes, other countries might be more strict or not prescribe opiates as much but if our healthcare systems main focus is not prescribing opiates than we have a major problem

that within itself is stupidity

ii cant get over the fact that some things are going to happen no matter what and government intervention only makes it worse yet each new president makes an attempt at doing something different


i dont like living to feel like i am restricted, bound to our countries moral code and stigma

ive been taking opiates since i was young

ever since i first enjoyed the feeling ive loved them


however


the most major factor in this is the mental cognition & physical control of ones ability to not feel the need to have the feeling that opiates gives you. once you let go of that, then you can actually use opiates however you'd like without really fucking up too much. always put your mind and body ahead of the drug no matter how far behind you think you are .

tl;dr
our countrys, and other countries most likely, laws make me feel like we live inside of a jail . 
why can't we have community gardens
why can't we build houses for one anothe
why can't we have free electricity distributed or created
why can't we do things together without having the government involved in every single FUCKING process of our lives
why do they allow a pharmacy in new york to charge $110 plus tax for a quarter gram marijuana oil cartridge that is less than 60% thc?
why does jeff sessions think that marijuana is worse than heroin?

Thailand is only going to have tramadol and benzos unless you've got a local who can speak Thai, as well as having a legitimate injury like a busted knee. When I go I'm going to have locals I know, so that makes a huge difference. I've never gone myself but several of my close friends have and they've scored, and I've been researching this for months, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

As a chipper with previous years of dependency that's barely from the edge of dependency with my rate of use, whenever I'm in an off-use period I can't stop considering going on a drug holiday. I know I'll go eventually once personal stuff in my life works out (bored AF of living in the States), but every time I'm not using I can't stop thinking about it. I probably look at flight prices into [forced edit:Two main cities in SE Asia, one in Thailand and one in Cambodia] at least every other day.

Don't get me wrong, there are MANY reasons to want to go that would seriously peak my interest (all the temples and historical sights, the food, etc.), but the one that obviously draws me the most is the drug availability over there. There's ""happy pizzas"" throughout SE Asia, which are strong weed pizzas, shroom shakes/other food, pretty widespread opium/heroin use to the point that certain bars, especially in Cambodia and Laos, have straight up menus with opium on them, whether opium tea or a bag of opium. 

Between this and the ability to get tramadol, benzos, and soma from Thai pharmacies and fucking EVERYTHING from Cambodian ones, such as tramadol, benzos, soma, ritalin, full on morphine, sometimes oxycodone (Thai pharmacies will also have all of these without a prescription, but it depends and they're a bit more strict, like you need to actually have a visible injury to get morphine vials), hell even gabapentin, it's a drug user's paradise. Some pharmacies in Cambodia even sell freaking liquid ketamine for IV use, though it can be cooked down for snorting. 

It's all cheap as fuck too, though the opioid pills apart from tramadol are a bit expensive. $5 for 20mg old school OCs is cheap for the US, but in SE that's a shit ton of money for a pill. Opium can be found for like $15-30 per g for tourist prices, and supposedly real non-fent China White is like $10-25/g if you get a few grams of it. There's even still full on opium dens with smoked opium and opium tea if you know where to look, especially in Laos. 

Sure it's all illegal, but as long as you don't combust weed (it's shit weed anyways, you'll want to eat it on edibles) and don't carry your drugs on you all over the place (only consume it on the premises and try to cop from pharmacies near your apartment/hotel during the day, and be sure to head straight back with your drugs), it's quite unlikely you'll get caught. You can get a mock prescription for like $40 if you want to legally beat the possible forced piss testing at checkpoints, but that's only in certain cities like parts of Bangkok.

It's just like I figure that what's the point of barely scraping by in the West if you can live comfortably for like $600/month all included, and that's eating out every day. If you can get by with just benzos (it's like 100 valium 10s for literally $3, l o l) and half g of opium or like fucking 70% pure heroin for $15-30/g that's only like $1100/month total living costs. Many people here already pay that much for freaking rent, if not double that in certain cities.

Anyone else been over there or constantly consider taking the plunge? It's the kind of hedonistic thing our culture completely shuns, but I figure with my online teaching gig I could work like seriously just 20 hours per week and afford the $1100/month plus like $500 per month in savings. It just seems too good to be true, but it's absolutely true.

Especially in Cambodia/Laos you can bribe police for as little as $5-50 per cop. In Thailand they'll want like $300-500 each for a bribe, which is bullshit.",1522987130.0

I quit twice before around 3 yrs ago when I went to italy where i knew no one to ask for around a couple months each time. Both were cold turkey but this time it feels like it's too much I can't do it cold.  I'll have around 100 15s, 30 30s & 30 20s. I'd say I'm around 150 mgs a day. I also have 3 subs for the very, very end. My fiance who is an amazing wonderful woman is gonna hold my batch this time and despense them. I realized it's over for me when after I continously spent the money I saved up for over a house these past years and when I would get my batch I wouldn't feel any happiness anymore I would only think about how I'm fucking it all up.

As the title says, I just threw away 10 months clean. I haven't been full on sober for these past 10 months, but I have stayed clean from dope. I've done more growing up and bettering myself in the last 10 months than I ever have in my life. I mean when I first switched to dope, I didn't give a fuck if I never woke up. 

I've dabbled with pills in the last 10 months though, on very special occasions. Recently started smoking weed again too after over a year  and a half off.

I don't really know what the point of this post is. Basically I feel like I can chip (yeah I know, I know, I told myself this when I first got into H) because things have gotten so much better for me over the last 2 years. I first switched from oxy to dope in 2014 because it seemed cost effective. I quickly spiraled down into the depths of a heroin addiction. I was suicidal, reckless, mixing benzos dope and coke regularly. I didn't see any friends or family for the first 6 months of 2016, I just stayed in my apartment and made up excuses why I couldn't come visit on holidays.

I quit dope the summer of 2016 thanks to 40mg of alprazolam, clonidine, and kratom. I was pretty set on my decision, I even got a shot of dilaudid in the ER two weeks after I quit dope because I had kidney stones. That rush reminded me why I loved opiates and threw my life away from dope. But I still stayed clean from opiates.

Two months after I quit dope, I had a seizure due to benzo withdrawal while I was driving with my girlfriend. At the time, this was my second seizure from benzo withdrawal. My parents got really suspicious since I live 4 hours away from them and they knew I've had an oxy problem back in 2012. Anyways, they find out I used to do heroin and boom, I get sent to rehab. At the time I was pissed because I had already quit dope, was falling in love with my girlfriend, and was happier than I'd been in years. Why go to rehab when shit is looking up ya know?

The first couple of weeks in rehab was hell. I told them during my intake that I've been taking 6mg Klonopin a day along with 60mg Temazepam. The psychiatrist tried to wean me off benzos in a week. After almost seizing during art therapy, they ""hooked me up"" and extended my taper 3 days. I met some cool people in rehab, learned a lot, had family week which was crazy but good. After 6 weeks, I will never ever forget that first day I was released. Taking a plane back home, I felt so vulnerable thrown into the world with no preparation on how to transition. 

I lived in a sober living and went to an IOP for 2 months. I was drug tested twice a week and what not. Then I moved in with my girlfriend and have been here ever since. I started dabbling with benzos again. I took xanax for one week straight and then stopped cold turkey because my parents were suspicious of me and I thought I'd get drug tested. 2 days after stopping only a week of xanax (doses never went above 3mg) lit a cigarette and boom, another seizure. I was all scraped up but so thankful my gf remembered I had asked to never take me to a hospital if I have a seizure. 

The seizure was unexpected because prior to that, I hadn't taken benzos for 5 months. Even now after over a year off daily benzos I will get a little bit of rebound anxiety 2 days after dosing.

I started hanging out with an old using buddy of mine. I started doing oxys again and my tolerance built so fast, we quickly switched to dope. So I'm using dope again, not physically dependent on it. My parents decide have me go to my old IOP and drug test. They watch you piss so I was fucked. Just about to finally graduate college and then had my relapse blow up in my face. Family crying, pissed at me, cut me off completely, no trust etc. (you guys know)

So since then I was clean from dope. I got drug tested once a week which moved to once every two weeks after 6 months. I found a job very quickly, paid my bills, paid my rent, and supported myself. I felt strong and independent. I still do and it blows my mind how far I've come. A few weeks ago, my gf found 150 of her mom's old Norcos. Now, I've been taking kratom every day since Dec 2016 so there is some cross tolerance. I very quickly found myself consuming 180mg of hydrocodone. Ran out within a week, and was grateful I didn't spend money on them. I went right back into the mindset that pills are a waste of money.

That was a few weeks ago and when I ran out I didn't have that sense of impending doom and panic like I used to. I think it's because facing reality isn't as hard as it used to be for me since my life has drastically changed and I actually look forward to a future and even want a future.

So yeah I scored some dope today, and it is some pretty good shit. I feel great off of the tiniest bit. I feel amazing, and don't really have much guilt. In a way I feel like I've earned it. I'm going to set up some strict rules for myself (heard that one before, I know) and have my gf help enforce them too. Like I can't buy dope for 2 months after this bag runs out. I can't use more than 3 times a week. 

Sorry for rambling all high haha. If you made it this far, then thank you. I just tried to type out like almost 4 years of shit and I don't think it turned out so good haha. But yeah, something feels different about chipping this time. I guess we'll see ",1522980354.0

So as some of you know, my fiancé found out about my addiction (heavy Morphine habit switched over a month ago from year long Oxy binge) and I’ve been wanting off for a long time, and consider this a blessing in disguise... especially how helpful and understanding she has been.

Welp I made it 61 hours with absolutely nothing to aid my w/d. Horrible headache, awful back pain, chills, massive pupils, feeling weak as fuck, super emotional, restless legs causing constant tossing and turning.. got maybe 1 hour total sleep last night in 20 minute increments. At 61 hours (9:30am) since my last dose I inducted 1mg Suboxone and my fiancé fixed me a nice hot bath with epson salts and apple cider vinegar along with the lights off, few candles going, relaxation sounds on the phone.... AMAZING.. highly recommended. Lol I didn’t get as much relief from that 1mg bupe as I’d hoped (within that hour anyway), but I got out of the bath and got in bed and dozed off for about half hour or so. Woke up, induced another .5mg sub (so 1.5mg total) and about an hour later I was TOTALLY maintained. Pretty much no withdrawal symptoms other than an achey back. 

Welp me and the lady got up and went to lunch, ran some errands... and I’m feeling good. I could’ve inducted the sub sooner, but I wanted to let that awful w/d smack me in the face one last time as a painful reminder of what this bullshit does. I only plan on using VERY small doses of bupe for a week or so (I have a 20 day taper planned but hope not to have to use it all). 

I am so close but so far... but I am fucking READY to be off opiates. This lifestyle is not worth that short lived high... which is just a band aid to your true emotions and feelings. I look forward to a happy, healthy life with my future wife and future family. I know this won’t be easy, but I truly want nothing to do with opiates any longer !! And the Suboxone should make the physical part of the withdrawal simple.. it will be the mental part following. I know how much my fiancé wants this for me... but I don’t think she truly understands how much I want this for myself. Which is most of the battle. 

Best of luck to my r/opiate family !!! I wish you all nothing but the best in life, success in beating your addictions, and for those of you who continue to use.. happy nods, but MOST IMPORTANTLY.. safe nods. Always be safe my friends.

I know, quitting is the best option, and I've been true-opiate free for a few days now (I've been taking T1s in the mornings, but I'm not counting that as real opiates since I'm not even taking much), but I'd love if you guys shared some ways that you met your now-dealers. 

When I lived out west, I managed to find a couple of guys and honestly I'm not even sure how they became my dealers. Fate, I guess, but if you asked me to re-live that timeline I don't even know if I could, lol. 

Well, so, morphine is my go-to (now), and originally I met a lady I used to work with (we'd been working together for months, and when I'm off opiates I'm fucking super bad for drinking, so I guess I was hungover during work one day) and said something along the lines of ""man, my head is killing me, I wish I had some painkillers"" and she kind of looks around and says ""well, I've got some 100mg codiene pills"" and I'm like ""man, we've been working together for months, how did we only cross this bridge now?!?!"" 


But anyways, it's besides the point because I'm 1000s of kms away from her now, as well as my legit dealer who I met later. Honestly, he's sent me morphine a couple of times through mail, but he's on a detox in Mexico right now and his roommate is the only one back home with the connection, and he's more worried about helpin' himself than me. Understandably, but you know. 

So anyways, I've met a couple of legit sources since I've been here, which have worked temporarily, but like, how can I find someone more reliable?!?!? Like I said, off opiates for days and I know the best idea is to just quit, but like, I'd love some fucking pills, lol.

I like this doctor and cant complain with the costs when paying out of pocket. I started March 15th, he charges 55 for weekly visits and 105 for monthly. He basically let's you choose which medication to take, they had a 2 week free meds with zubsolve so I went with that. He started me out on 1 - 5.7 pill twice daily, so basically 14 pills each week which cost 95 at the pharmacy they reccomend. 

I still haven't looked for a job, I dunno what's my problem. I feel fine with the 2 per day, but think it's a bit over prescribed. I followed it by taking 1 a day the first 2 days and then 2 a day until about 2 days ago. I started splitting one pill half around noon and half in the evening. It seems to be enough, no real symptoms of withdrawal. I told him I wanted to stay on the same dose and said that I didn't have anymore pills left over. I got a 56 pill prescription,  I'm going to try to stick to 1 pill split each day. Just don't know how long I should do that before trying to take less. I still take a couple to few dabs a day, which the doctor is cool with. But now that I got this month script, I'd like to try to taper to nothing before my next visit or pretty close.

I really need a job, my girlfriend and I live together. She doesn't know I started yet taking pills or dope, and I've quit now, doesn't know about my bupe doctor either. But shes starting to botch, my parents have been bitching. I haven't worked for 4 months now. 

Any suggestions for a bupe taper, how many days I should take the 1 pill vs the 2 pills I've been taking over last few weeks. Also after the 1 pill, how much should I try taking?

Was doing over 200-300mg of Oxycodone, morphine orally as well per day.. now I’m all the way down to just 30mg to feel that nice feeling, slight sedation, but never the first high. That’s a good tolerance jump for over 100+ days off those giant dosages..

Now, something I didn’t see during that time was how my addiction was hurting her; I thought it was just affecting my pockets.. but looking back at the pain she’s been through with me, I did put her through a lot of pain, even though I would suffer through withdrawal until my own money would be in my hands; or someone would front and I’d pay them back, but no stealing or anything. I will say lying because a lie is a lie no matter how big or small. Period.

But overall I’ve always been quiet, socially anxious, bad ADHD, PTSD and a lot of physical symptoms of depression/feeling disconnected when not on opiates/benzos. That’s why I picked the opiates up in the first place besides pain mainly, and it helped, but it hurt me and surely her. I never knew how bad my symptoms were besides the social anxiety before and after the extreme addiction. Recovery is hard.

Recovery is very hard, but worth it. Throughout these months of being clean off the extremely high doses of Oxy/morphine, I relapsed less than 30 days ago on 300-400mg of morphine, bare tolerance due to the longevity of being off. I also took it with 700mg of Soma (which I never touched before until that time bc my dad died from soma) and I believe a very high dose of Klonopin for my body, about 6-10mg...

Now I’m responsible for my own actions, but I feel as if my girlfriend puts a lot of mental pressure and expectations on me regardless of being here for me and telling me to take baby steps genuinely, and we’re still in our own home for 6-7 months,

She will bring up the past very often, although she never developed an addiction as bad as mines, she would still use Oxy, Vicodin, small dose Suboxone and what not and I would make sure not to give it to her for more than 2 days, even though I was using daily, I didn’t want her to grow into the addiction I knew was bad, but looking back I didn’t know it was extremely bad. So I’m glad I did not make her grow a dependency, as she also stands up for her individuality and her own decision making to say yes or no, and I love her very much. 

But when she brings up the past of the bad things I did, or she knows that I’m mentally recovering she’ll literally talk or scream at me like a 3 year old and I do not talk to her negatively because she’s very sensitive (as I am, but I shut down, I don’t talk and I’ll wait for everyone to leave before crying because I’m purely humiliated easily, I have little confidence. If I say something back that she says to me, she’ll be all hurt and I get very apologetic so I generally just don’t say anything at all or I’ll go along with what she’s saying because she’s enjoys arguing and does *not* know when to stop pushing everybody’s buttons. Especially the people she’s most comfortable with. And when I voice to her how I don’t appreciate the way she’s communicating to me, I feel belittled, she’ll back her reasoning up with it by saying something in the nature of “well I have to talk this way because the only time you listen to what I say is when I scream it’s annoying.” “You cut me off and don’t let me get to the point” when I 1) don’t get off topic with what she’s saying 2) I’m keeping connected to her dialogue so I can actively listen and actually understand vs saying “yes, I know” my mind will wonder, and she still doesn’t take this into consideration. I obsess in my mind over everything and I’m overly considering everything, even detail that doesn’t matter in a sense. I’m an over thinker.

But the way she talks to me accompanied is in the sense of the way I’m typing. I speak less, type more, she speaks more if understandable? For example, right now she just got up, not even up for an hour and she’s yelling at me saying “you’re stubborn, you always do what you want to do, you’re not getting my point, you’re going through codeine withdrawal and so am I. I feel like I’ve been taken advantage of [because I went to my psychiatrist yesterday, was panicking severely because I myself can’t speak up 99% of the time, and she simply explained to our psychiatrist of 6 years for me and 10+ for her how bad my addiction was bc he didn’t know too much about it, and I then asked him to switch me from Ativan to Valium and he did which is rare for him to do. She took herself off her 20mg Adderall tab which she never ever takes at all “because the semester is over” and she spoke about how she doesn’t want to get it prescribed anymore before our appointment and I agreed with her decision making, he kept her on the 10mg tab, and he also kept me on my 20mg tab x2 daily that I don’t like taking at times because it makes me feel too stimulated at times body wise, I feel no mental effects but with Ritalin/Concerta I do, and that’s why I never bothered to abuse Adderall. I tried taking 40mg before and I realized that it’s medicine to me not a recreational drug because it doesn’t have a speedy effect on me.] so she’s making the point that the reason she feels taken advantage of is because I should stop the benzos for a week and start all my meds then, but it has been 4 days without a proper dosage for me and today is my first dosage of taking the 2mg Valium as directed, 5 days ago I took my last 1mg Klonopin. But the point she keeps saying “you’re not getting my point” when I respond with what’s going on with me and she truly doesn’t want to hear it when I tell her, not out of trust, but she wants me to do it the way she sees fit.. and how she sacrificed the Adderall that she doesn’t take, and spoke about discontinuing before even mentioning to her about the Valium, so she can help me get on Valium and it’s a slap in the face to her that I won’t wait 1 week without any benzos to start taking it? And there’s a stomach bug going around (even people I know who don’t use have it now) with the same symptoms as us. I never get the urge to vomit/watery poop just softer from opiate/benzo withdrawal ever, in the past from cold turkeying 300mg of morphine oral, but all of a sudden she believes in withdrawal from codeine, I took less than 300mg a day, spaced it throughout the day how I felt for 5 days, and she kept saying “it’s codeine think of the rappers how they’ve gone through it, it’s not weak.” and I know it’s a bug because she only consumed 1-2 Tylenol 3s for not even 3-4 days... I don’t appreciate how she’s confident in putting any thought deeply both negative or positive into my head. It’s like she’s taking everything out she’s feeling on me. It’s so trig
gering. But I fight the emotions and cope, I try so hard not to relapse for my own good, her and us, but she gets so cold, she dominates the conversation with everybody she’s comfortable with and me I feel like the main target, her mother is second. 

And also another point too, I noticed that ever since she’s got her check of $4000 she’s walking around like more of an asshole with her voice, level of ignorance and entitlement. 

My heart pounds in panic everyday and she amplifies it in a bad way, she speaks about how our relationship has been abusive in the aspect of my addiction a while back, however the verbal abuse the expectations and the controlling ways that I’m feeling daily from her is making me feel like I can’t sleep unless she says so, have to go down on her (sexually) whenever she wants to but I can count on my fingers on one hand of the amount of times I’ve asked her to do the same to me I’m not a highly sexually driven male at 19, I don’t expect anything of her but to make her happy. I didn’t even go to my dentist appointment because of the stress that she put on me upon waking up.",1522944376.0

I have a habit of roughly 1 gram of heroin via IV daily and Benzos 10+mg of Xanax or Clonopin or rc's like etizolam or clonazolam if I can't get real xans.

I’m in PA, every dentist I’ve told about my extreme dental phobia, has told me they can’t do anything for that. So this new dentist came out first visit to me said they can just give me a high dose Valium to relax , 2nd visit saw I was on Suboxone and they just told me get a letter of discontinuation in which I did and they give me 10mg Valium prescribed every single visit, even for X-Rays/cleanings. And they mentioned how I need a root canal and my instinctive self mentioned that root canals are painful the day after and how I was given Tylenol 3 by previous dentist for this pain for 2-3 days, and the dentist said yeah that’s not a problem we’ll give you that when you’re ready for your root canal.. being recognized as socially anxious by my girlfriend but also ungrateful when it comes to meds, should I just accept the Tylenol 3 because I’m the one who mentioned “I don’t want anything too strong like Vicodin or Percocet just Tylenol 3”.. I can probably answer my own question to: if it was hard enough to find a dentist to give me sedatives not only once unlike others but *every* visit and ok with Tylenol 3 for root canal, should I just be accepting and not push for Vicodin? That would be plain stupid I suppose. *so, is it common to find dentist like this?* I also want to note that I got 1 wisdom tooth removed and it was extremely painful and I had OP80s at home thank goodness but all they sent me home with was antibiotics and ibuprofen 600 or 800. Now that was painful, haven’t had a root canal since I was about 15 (I’m 19 going on 20) when my mom was alive and the old dentist gave me the  *she specifically said “oh can you give my son not Percocet but a Vicodin or something and I can monitor him bc he’s up all night crying in pain*” and the dentist handed her a Rx for the T3s. I only took 1/2 of one that time and assumed I was high because I slept for an hour after taking it, and never touched them again for months.. 

*crazy* to think how addiction can start at anytime based on environment and decisions, not just a “I’m not getting addicted” mindset, because I was taking only 2.5mg of Percocet x1 daily after the gym 3-4 times a week and on the rare social gatherings... that was when I was 17-18yo then 3 months before my 19th birthday I received a lump sum check for $7,666 in the mail as death survivor benefit for being under 19 that I had no clue of at all. And roughly $655-666 monthly until 1 month after my 19th b-day on top of my job money.. weeks into having the money, I found myself taking not 2.5mg of Oxy anymore but 30mg, 60mg, 100mg: *not related to my dentist question and all but I really want to throw it out there that addiction can happen to absolutely anyone without the right support and proper environment, regardless of what your tell yourself. 

TL;DR: read 1st ironically long pretty long paragraph about dentist sorry about the way I type I have co-morbid ADHD I’m starting to address again. 2nd paragraph just acts as a warning of how unexpected addiction is, and how it comes out of no where.

*TL;DR2: my dentist good or nah? This a common practice? Bad dental phobia, no dentist ever suggested or treated it till now, gives me 10mg Valium every visit to take, getting root canal, agreed to give me Tylenol 3 after. Also aware I was once on Suboxone.. jeez why can’t I just type short like this.*",1522927670.0

A rash I've had for 9 months turned out to be a rare lymphoma that only has a 50/50 five year rate of survival. It's very aggressive and has already spread. Plus lymphoma is very prevalent in my family, including 7 close relatives.

With that said I have only a 50/50 chance of survival within the next 5 years or less. 

I made it my life goal a few months ago to try every drug (at least the major usual ones in the US), at least once, if I found out I was dying because I am physically disabled. I figured it would be a way for me to get out the ""fun years"" I never had by doing this.

I have only smoked tobacco and weed (both a lot of times/regularly), drank (semi heavily with a high tolerance, so rarely truly drunk) and eaten mushrooms (4 times, all awesome experiences with terrible scary comedowns) in my entire 23 years of life.

A large majority of my family have been hardcore addicts (including both parents) and many OD'ed and passed away from substance abuse. Opiates are a large mix in those Ods. I do drink a lot and love smoking/drinking but I never crave more of a ""high"" from anything else. I don't think I have an addictive personality but I could easily be just very naïve.


With all that said, do you think I should follow through on my plan? I don't want to wait too long until I'm on my deathbed and miserable to start. I also don't want to have a 50% chance at survival but survive seriously addicted to opiates or other hard to break drugs. Best case scenario would be that I try them all of them and end up surviving without being addicted. A 25% chance

Which I was cool with as I've been going to the methadone clinic for two weeks now. 

So I pick him up and he hands me my bar which I take, no opiates so I was cool with it. 

So we get to his spot and he gets a .5 that he us splitting between him and two others. Do we get the product. Drop off the other people so it's just me and him left with like a 30min drive back to his place. He has an alright tolerance, so he does like three good key bumps. 

About ten minutes later he is slumping hard,  come to find out he was already really barred out and he didn't tell me about it. 

So like 5 min away from where we were supposed to get the food homeboy goes slump god mode completely unresponsive. My car is completely clean so I pull over into the next parking lot I see. I turn my interior lights on, his lips are becoming blue (bad sign) and his breathing is beginning to sound like agonal breathing (very bad sign). So he is completely unresponsive to whatever I do, so I might the right choice of calling 911 right then and there. 

The dispatcher on the phone was really helpful. He instructed me on how to do mouth to mouth and administer chest compressions, so I'm doing that alternating between the two by that time the police and paramedics show up. They notice he has an erratic pulse and started to put the breathing mask on for him and gave his three doses of narcan. His breathing starts to return to normal although I don't know if they ever got his responsive as they took him away in an ambulance before i could see. I was still in possession of his ID so the cop there recommend that I take it to his parents house. 

So I show up at his parents house and they immediately start raising cane like ""this is all your fault"" ""you sold him the boy""(not true)  I tried telling them that I have been in a methadone clinic for the past two weeks and they don't care, his mom starts calling the county cops that we both live in to get me arrested. There wasn't even anything illegal in my car. They don't even listen to the fact I have been clean. So as I'm walking away to leave they are yelling at my that it's all my fault and that the cops will come to my house and arrest with. But like, bitch I just saved your son from drugs that I didn't even know he did that much of. She said she had my license plate number. Can the police actually do anything in this case??

My current living situation is not the best. Me and my bro live together.  I don't really think about getting high that much. But as soon as other people are high around me, I can't stop thinking about it. 

It's such a struggle. I never realized how people's mood switch so much. It's like they are down and quiet when they don't have enough , then they are running around the house singing the next day. It's mental torture being around people that have mood swings all the time and are high around you when you are staying sober. 

I have recently moved into the middle of no where. So I can't really go anywhere. I have been just trying to be nice and talk to him and hang out when he is not high. When they are high I just try to stay in my room and keep to myself.

I am trying to get myself out of this, but for the time being I just have to deal with it. I have been doing good and just sticking to my subs. But it's just hard. 

Is anyone else on a similar situation and what do you do to cope?

Would this question be different if the drug is oxy 80 and 120 vs street H?  How feasible is it to have someone contained in a fixed usage schedule?  But then ofc there’s always the door to go for someone who doesn’t use...

so I finally need to quit this stuff, mainly bc I simply don't have any money left to spend and just various other reasons.
I'm sort of not really planning on never using again, which might be a stupid view point, but definitely to get clean for now and to be able to live my life without having to worry about being sick when I don't get material bc I'm wastin my entire time on this lifestyle.

So this will be my first time going through withdrawals, properly. And I'm scared to death.
So I'm seeking for some advice and shit from you more experienced guys. Something like a time frame when what symptoms might occur and stuff would be helpful as well, like a ""trip report"" for withdrawing.

I want to make this as painless as I can, no matter the costs. If that means swallowing insane amounts of vomex or whatever. My liver or whatever suffering can deal with the damage done to it during withdrawal later, lol, the most important goal right now is getting my body out of expecting opiates which'll stop coming.

Worst symptoms for me are the nausea and the psychological icky feel, like I have depression and anxiety normally but going through WDs, let's say I'm not convinced I won't try to killl myself.
I'm emetophobic as well, which means I'm scared of the act of throwing up, so I'll wanna try to suppress that as good as I can.

In times of discomfort it's extremely important for me to have some sort of time frame, I'll cling myself to the knowledge of ""at worst this will only last for 20 more hours"" or smth. So personal anecdotes are appreciated.
I know everyone is different, but yea. I assume this is not gonna be as bad as it could be as this is my first time detoxing and my habit isn't *too* bad, I'm coming down from about half a g (IV) a day, doing it since about half a year regularly.

What I have here to help myself with - and I hope experienced people can give me some sort of dosing advice, remember my main goal is to get through this as painlessly as possible, with least nausea and anxiety/depression I can, tho ofc I won't get around it completely - is the following:

0,25 g H, which I could spread out in small shots over several hours, so as not to quit Cold turkey and by thus making the symptoms better... but I don't know how much sense that makes and how I should dose here, or if it just makes the suffering go on longer instead of quitting CT after having 1 more shot in the morning

Paracetamol, Ibuprofen for pain?

Vomex, Superpep for nausea

Lopedium, for diarrhea and some people say it helps the symptoms as well bc lope is an opioid agonist or smth

50 pills of Promethazin, which is supposed to help with anxiety and anti-emetic and a sleep aid. I'm having high hopes in taking large doses of this to sleep through some of it, is that gonna be advisable?

And most importantly, about 150g of Kratom. I know this can be my most powerful help in this bc it can almost completely get rid of withdrawals, but I have no idea when and how much to dose, so as to make this as painless as possible, but also not get too nauseous from the Kratom in combo with WD nausea... 

Furthermore, I take Sertralin, an anti-depressant, which I'll just continue to keep taking as usual through this. I also have a bunch of Effexor pills laying around here too, but I don't assume antidepressants can be of any help in this here.

PLEASE HELP ME. If you don't have any factual advice any nice words taking away my sheer panic from people that have survived this as well that say it's not as bad as I'm imagining it'll be are also very much welcome...

Thanks everyone, sorry for all the rambling, you can feel free to write a lot of words on your own WD/getting clean experiences if you want to (or link me somewhere where you already have), I'll read it all and will be thankful for some reading material of people that have been in my situation.",1522883609.0

Practical Advice Please,"Whaddup yall, its been a while since ive made a new post  here. Wall of text incoming, sorry about that

So ive been clean since a couple weeks before christmas. so almost 4 months. Things have been great and awful simultaneously lately

i went to san francisco. i started a band and we wrote an album. im moving to LA and getting a job as a PA at a certain kid-oriented television station (lmao). on the flip side of that though..

i am more depressed and anxious than ive ever been in my life. im on trazadone for sleep/depression and clonidine (and occasionally benzos) for anxiety but they dont seem to be helping much lately. finally getting out there and making connections // meeting new people // putting my work out there has been soo fucking taxing as an introvert. rewarding, definitely. but super draining as well. not trying to seem like im bitching i guess. life is just hard, ya know? im sure you guys relate

anyway im rambling, sorry.

so ive kinda been planning a relapse. ive floated the idea for a couple weeks but it's still too early in my sobriety rn so I decided not to. i dont have a specific time or anything in mind, but sometime in the future id just like to get high for a day, then get back on my subs. I just want a single day to clear my mind, relax, and enjoy myself.

I've  had experience switching back and forth between dope/subs  frequently and the subs always stop working for me pretty quickly so im not gonna do that. And suboxone has helped me so much this year that i dont plan on getting off them anytime soon, or jeopardizing my prescription. my ""move-to-LA"" savings depend on that. so this is kinda like a one off on some unspecified future date. It could be next month or it could be 6 months from now. but I just wanna have the logistics worked out if things happen to line up right, ya know?

My question though: being on subs, will this even be worth it? 

Ive heard I have to wait 2 days after my last sub dose to even feel the dope. so say i do and get high for a day. Can i just take my suboxone as normal the next morning? or do i have to then wait *another* 24 hours to avoid precipitated withdrawals? 3 days of suffering just to get high once sounds fucked, honestly

**i guess the main question is:** anyone have experience using for a day while on subs then going back? was it worth it? what was your operating procedure and dose times, etc?

thanks guys ❤️️

I got kicked it for unrelated reasons (not drugs, just crazy gf that got mad because I found out she fucked someone)
So I moved in with my parents again until I could find another sober home.   But I wasn’t sober so I couldn’t find one..
I’ve been staying with them for about 6 months now.... and I had a job, so I started buying dope everyday because I was a server (keywords: Had and Was.  I got fired a couple months ago).  Then after I got fired I started hustling, being a middle for some people I worked with that couldn’t find it.  

Well, now my parents have been telling me that I need to move out already and that staying with them was supposed to be temporary.  They wanted me to go back into sober living, but I can’t because I’m not sober at all.   If I get an apartment they said that they’ll help me out with rent and stuff until I get on my feet, but I know I’ll end up slipping up, and I know that eventually I’ll have to go to rehab again.....   but I don’t know how I’m supposed to tell them..
But it’s better to tell them now and get help now, instead of waiting 2-3 months for me to hit rock bottom to tell them..

I don’t know how to tell them....
I’m so anxious..

I've seriously done it now...,"While being freshly on probation and only a couple weeks ago having completed (probably at least my 8th) detox to at least get a solid foundation again. I stayed clean around a little over a week or so. 

Then I proceeded to proposition my grandfather (I had been staying at grandparents during the day while parents worked to help grandparents as well as obviously giving parents peace of mind) to drive me into the not so nice section of my New England state's capitol city, which is a dump period so by saying ""not so nice section"" it's a hood of hoods. All just to get one bundle. Of course I had to convince my g-pa to give me 30 dollars at the last second so as to afford it lol. 

Now I knew I had to meet with my newly assigned probation officer within a week but I assured myself I'd figure it out (spoiler alert: I rarely, if ever, successfully pull this kinda stuff off). Well I keep this up for .. idk maybe 3-4 days seeing this one dealer, primarily because I know he will be where we agree to meet in a reasonable time frame (by Dboy standards that is). Because I had sold my nice little Galaxy s8 for 200 fucking dollars prior to detoxing... Last ditch move so I could get high... Sigh...

So this particular day I decided I was gonna take the risk of arranging to meet one of my other dealers who has hard. Although I've been going to him on and off basically since I started using at all, we'll just say he isn't the most prompt guy out there. Now add that I don't have a cell to tell him I'm here, ask him where he is, light a fire under his ass... Now this is a recipe for disaster. But... Crack... So yeah.

Miraculously he shows up somewhere around 10 minutes after we get there give or take. Keep in mind I'm with my grandfather again, if I had my car I wouldn't dare put him at risk with this lifestyle and it's inherent dangers. Anyway I'm psyched I got a couple fat rocks and some new dope he claims is retarded good. 

Well it was retarded good ladies and gentlemen. What happened next I don't even know how to sensibly convey to you all. The best way I can think to describe the events that came next is, if you've had those times in bed or otherwise, and you're not quite fully asleep but also not quite fully awake. So you're doing and saying things that sound and look utterly and completely insane to anybody else around. Im talking straight up concerning. So yeah apparently that happened and my poor grandfather was probably scared shitless, cus I remember at least one potentially two photographic memories from the event and if I were him in that situation I'd call the cops.

I'll adventure with recipes a little, try something new, completely different to what I'd cook if i was sober, normally i'd be on a microwave meal or a simple oven cooked meal.

My friends love it, and theres leftovers for the next day when I do want to eat. Good system.",1522870523.0

X post from r/kratom:

I have been taking kratom since 2016, however I moved to daily use about 7 months ago. I self medicate with kratom for ADD on top of my prescribed medicine (dextroamphetamine) and in place of it. My doses quickly ramped up and I’ve now been on a stable 20-24 grams a day, but it varies (rarely ever goes over 24g). For a long time, I didn’t think kratom had any withdrawals and pretty much gave no thought to how much I was taking. However when I tried to stop taking it for a couple days, I quickly discovered that wasn’t true. I’m definitely not a hater of this plant by any means, and I believe should remain 100% legal, I’m just sharing my experience. After 12 hours of no use, I start to get uncomfortable  RLS symptoms, a runny nose, and severe lethargy like I’ve never felt in my life. It feels extremely difficult to move, and all I want to do is lay down. I have tried to taper off or quit cold turkey for about 3 months now but to no avail. Tapering is difficult with toss and wash when you’re eyeballing doses with just a spoon, so accurately staggering doses becomes hard to do.

Anyways, I finally went to my doctor for some stomach discomfort I’ve been having and, feeling like it was the best option, told him all about my kratom use, dosages, length of use and withdrawals. He didn’t know much about it but had heard of it before, and asked me if tapering/quitting is something I want to do. I told him I do as I’d rather not be dependent on anything (however I still want to use it occasionally, just not daily). He said to taper and that he would get more advice and call back. He called a little while ago and said that in higher doses, it behaves like an opioid (I know this) and said he recommends suboxone to get off of it.

My question is, has anyone had an experience similar to mine, and should I go on suboxone or just taper off? I worry that I’d just be replacing this legal plant with an established opioid and severely draw out or even make my situation much worse. I’m considering it as the withdrawals make day to day life more difficult than I need right now, but I’m not sure how to move forward.

I should add that I obviously take kratom for the euphoria and good feelings too and my reasons are not purely medicinal.
