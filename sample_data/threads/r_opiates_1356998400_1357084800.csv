And what would you do if you found out a younger sibling and/or their friends were using opiates?'","b""I'm curious because my younger brother and his friends have mentioned taking Vicodin, taking morphine, snorting oxys and talking about how much they like the feeling and the high, a couple of them have mentioned it's even better then weed. I'm just sitting here confused and a bit afraid about what to do, I don't want him making the same mistakes I did. I also do not want to ignore it completely. \n\n  My brother knows I use but not how much I actually use, I never ever give him any drugs and never use around him or his friends and his friends do not know I use and I plan to keep it that way. I don't condone minors using opiates but I don't want to be the buzz kill/ass hole older sister. \n\n  I'm thinking about sitting my brother down for a talk about the dangers of using prescription pills/opiates, which will include how easily addictive they are, how much trouble he'll get in if he gets caught, showing him statistics on overdoses, and informing him how to use in the safest manner. If I can't stop him from experimenting I can at least prevent harm right? \n\n  If the situation escalates I will have no choice but to tell our parents and his friends parents but right now I think it's just a faze where teenagers are starting to experiment with other substances besides cannabis.\n\n  If you have anything to add or any advice on how I should handle this situation it's much much appreciated, if it helps he's 17 and I'm 21. Thank you all very much in advance.\n\nTl;dr: Found out younger brother and his friends have been using prescription pills/opiates, don't want to be the buzz kill older sibling. Pretty sure and hoping it's just a teenage drug experimentation faze. Simply just thinking about sitting him down for a talk and need advice on how to go about this situation.""",1357011090.0

Everyone has been there and can relate to the good times and the shitty ones. So happy new year to you guys/girls and enjoy the night. To those who weren't able to nod tonight I feel you brother/sister. If you were near me I would share whatever I had with you. Because I know that feel all too well.
