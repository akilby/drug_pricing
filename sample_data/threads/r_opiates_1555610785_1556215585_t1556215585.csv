first post ever here but I'm an old lurker. Just wanted to share my story and success about quitting opiates after 4 years of daily use (began at 17yo, smoked plugged and IVed). Allthough at the end I was on methadone (75 to 100mg) for a year, I still used heroin/fent (mostly fent as I had access to a prescription) and the metha for withdrawals.

I went to a psychiatric hospital 3 times and the last one worked allthough they made me quit methadone COLD TURKEY (they gave me a shit ton of valium though, like 100mg daily). And well, as you guys know: it was worse than hell physically for freaking 2 months and then the psychologic aspect began...

I was craving opiates so much I had to start smoking weed again (was also a big addiction for me in my 15-16th, like 50g a week). But now I managed to control it to ""only"" two joints a day before bed time. I tried Kratom and loved it but at the moment I can't afford it due to my weed use.

I also forgot to mention I have crippling anxiety (diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder) and chronic depression (these started way before any drug use, allthough drugs must have surely enhanced it). 

I'm now on sertraline (zoloft) 200mg and wellbutrin 300mg daily - both for depression as it does nothing to my anxiety. It kinda works, more than any other medication anyway. I talked to my doctor about Kratom and he said he's not against it but I should be careful nonetheless. 

My doc also prescribed me xanax as my anxiety has gone up the last few months. And... it works wonders (I think I wouldn't be sharing my story if I had not taken one earlier). I'm extremely cautious about my use as I have an addictive personality. I'm aware of all the dangers and I try not to take it to often (even though it's hard as my anxiety is unbearable and it ruins my life). But since I have xan I slowly feel that I can adapt to this shitty society and I almost cried the other day because of it helping me so much. I'm starting to have friends and I'm starting to think now I could try higher education again (failed 3 times due to my anxiety/depression and drug use).

Sorry for my looong ass post. But it felt good writing it even if no one reads it. Thanks for those who did :)

Tldr: today I've been off opiates for 6 months !",1556214297.0

Just wanted to run this through the community because I’ve never had this happen before. So I got my usual from my usual connect. I’ve been dealing with her forever (8+years) and I trust her. She usually is amazing to deal with and no bull. I always get 30s from her and the kind they are always depends. This time, they were the yellow round 30 mg with the t 189 imprint. Ive gotten those from her before so I put them in the baggy and went about my business.

Today I took the bag out to do one and I noticed that there is some powder residue rubbing out into the bag. That hasn’t happened to these before as far as I can remember. So I’m a little weary. So I snort one and it def burns. I don’t have the drip/taste that I am used to either. Now it’s been a while since I’ve had the yellows so I’m wondering if maybe I forgot. But now I have some numbness with my drip too. 

I’m not overly high. I don’t feel like it hit me hard or anything it’s just different. Are these fent? I don’t do dope usually and I can count on one hand the times I have so I just know something is different. I also usually get energy from my pills and I’m dragging.

Once upon a time (yesterday), Ol' Papi Percocet was given a super legit primo contact from my main middle. He is a good dude, stand up guy and I think he just had enough of the crap and decided I could just deal with them. So I make contact with the new source and told to meet up 30 min from my home at 11:30. ""Please be on time! :) Then we will drive 10 minutes to go grab the stuff in ""The Cities"" The Cities are twins but one of them is ugly and old, yuck. I get to the set location at 11:25, Ol' Papi Percocet is a punctual man, ladies ;) and let her know that I am here. ""Ok, 5 min!""...so i wait, I wait some more, and wait... half hour later she comes rolling in in a car that's about to break down and die right there... "" Hey man, can you drive? I don't have any gas."" Great sign. Whatever, not like I want to drive in that POS as it is, I'll probably get Tetanus or Hep C. The middle brought her two crackhead friends as well! The more the merrier, merryer? Now, I am not bragging, just trying to paint a picture of Ol' Papi Percocet's car. It is a 2015 Audi A6 Supercharged, it is very nice, I keep it pristine and clean. It is also my family's car. It is just as much my little boy's as it is mine. He has a great set up in the back with his car seat and the extra leg room in the A6. So they need room to sit so i have to rip out the carseat and throw it in their car, yes i checked for needles sticking in it after. Immediately they crack open a window and start smoking cigarettes before I could tell them not to smoke in my son's car. Already irritated... So guess what? We have to go pick up ANOTHER person! My middle, has a fucking Middle! My Middle, his middle and her Middle... fuck my life. So we go to pick her up! Sitting waiting another half hour for this lady to walk ten feet out of her apartment to our car. So what do the little crackheads my middle brough do? Start fucking smoking Meth in my car without asking! AGGGH. The other middle is handicapped with the cane, fine. Out walks this YHUUUGE African American Lady, 5 people squeezed into the car, and a morbidly obese lady in my front see kicking the floor cause she doesn't have enough room in a full size executive car. Whatever, ill be done with these people in 10 minutes, right? WRONG! Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady has to drive back into The Cities, the nice one. To get her paycheck before anything can happen. Ol' Papi Percocet, is not a happy camper but he buckles down and starts driving, pretty much back to his house knowing he will have to drive back and drop them off. So as we are driving down, I find out the reason why we are dragging our feet is because there are another two people we are meeting up with, who were supposed to pick up Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady at 11:30 but they were late from driving from a city 3 hours away and she is fuming and ignoring their calls, so as I am driving they are blowing this up and she has her phone ringer fully on just blasting some Hardcore Rapper CONSTANTLY. Finally, she answers and just starts screaming at them, jut full on chaos and I have to listen on speaker as these other crackheads are giving every excuse in the book, begging, BEGGING, Pleading for her to help them score their dope after she said she wasn't fucking with them today. Idiots drove 3 hours to get here and couldn't fucking be on time, not my fault, not even Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady. She needed to be picked up at 11:30 to make this work for 7 people, I got her frustration, but damn, Ol' Papi Percocet's ears were hurting. We finally get downtown and Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady goes to pick up her check so I'm sitting with my Middle's Middle and the two crackheads who are begging me to let them smoke meth in my car, I guess they couldnt get out of the car and smoke it on the street. So, Sassy Strong Independent Black Lady tells us to sit put because she will be 10 minutes in and out, and I know how she is on time. So Baby Jr Crackhead as I called him decides he has to go tinkle, Dowtown, in the middle of fucking lunch hour looking like a Baby Jr Crackhead with all the business professionals walking around, so he dips cause he has got to go tinky. Fucking Idiot, SSIBL comes back out, in ten minutes and BJC isnt there, so she goes off again screaming and yelling. Just fuck my life. SSIBL explains we have to be there at a certain time or the guy is gone, Finally BJC runs back out and we start moving to go meet the out of town crackheads down the street at at a specific clear location given to them. Guess what, they arent there. SSIBL starts going ballistic again calling them, These crackheads are so lost and out of it they have no idea, all they do is plead and BEG to SSIBL about how sorry they are and what big pieces of shit they are. Just amazes me how much berating and agreement someone can take to get their dope. PLEEEAAASE, PLEAAASE SSIBL! Whatever, finally find them and we go to Northside to finally meet up with My Middle's Middle's Middle's Dude. My Middle's Middle is short and SSIBL goes off again, so she blames it on me, thanks a lot...And the wait begins again. I am like 4 hours into this thing at the end of it. We finally get it and I start the drive back and the fucking crackheads and Middle's Middle start fucking smoking the dope 3 packed in the back of my car, Now I am fucking screaming along with SSIBL. ""DUde, we are so sick....PLEEEEASE"". Not Like I'm not fucking sick, but I fucking wait because of its not suspicious in the dope capital of my state to have a nice ass car in the hood, with 3 crackhead looking white people in the back with a obese Sassy Strong Independent Black lady in the back... she was super sweet though, you know how they are. After i get all the crackheads out of my car she apologizes to me saying I have been nothing but sweet, she shorts all there bags to give me extra an then gives me an extra half.

I used daily from 18 to 23 and then spent the last five years pecking away occasionally. Eventually one of the times overdosed me and I decided I needed to get serious and got the shot. That was 8 months ago and I've gotten it monthly since then. 

When you first get sober, life is going to suck for a few months. That is true whether you are on viv or not. I feel that many people claim that viv stopped all of their happiness and all that as soon as they started taking it, but those folks hadn't been clean for six months to see how shitty you feel when you take your first opiate break in ten years. 

In my five years of chipping I had made a point of getting in shape, lifting in the winter and running in the summer. Over time I switched to mostly running half marathon distances. I run about 35 miles a week and can win most of my local 5 and 10 k races. I'm not a pro or anything but I'm a strong runner. 

When I first got on viv I felt like my running and lifting was done. Doing bench press I felt like the weight was heavier and running my legs felt like lead. I was convinced the viv did it to me. I got it in my head and hated it like crazy but I HAD to keep taking it. I have a house and a partner and pets and a god damn fantastic job that I couldn't lose. 

So I knuckled down and ran through it. I truly believe that it did have some minor negative effects in the first week, but after a few long runs, within the first two weeks, I was feeling a distinct runners high from my long runs. 

I want to repeat. As an athlete who works out 7 days a week, it does not kill the runners high. I know there will be people who are going to contradict this but I'm willing to bet that 99% of them who claim it kills the rush from running or working out were not running or working out regularly before they got on viv. They were doing dope all day. 

I say to people who want to get into fitness that you need to dedicate two months to it. 3x a week for two months is enough for your body to get used to it and for working out to switch from sucking to feeling good. 

I'm not going to say that viv will work for everyone in terms of side effects, but don't tell yourself ""I can't do it because it will kill runners high"" if you haven't gotten off your ass in the last two years. You aren't going to get runners high from anything if you aren't in shape at all. Viv is worth a shot though because if you are ready to get clean and willing to get 12 shots, it WILL WORK for you in terms of keeping you alive. I'm staying on it a few more months to continue to work out my issues but all that time I'm going to be collecting race t shirts and hardware!",1556202348.0

He asked which meds to which I told him I would trust his judgement. He prescribed physical therapy and tramadol first. I could have probably asked for hydrocodone but he was being so cool and compassionate that I was too shocked. He asked me to go get an mri and an xray and to come back in two weeks for more medication. I will tell him the tramadol is making me sick and not helping as much with the pain which is true.

I have a debilitating back issue that I’ve had for 13 yrs. No it’s not your normal sore back that will get better with some ibuprofen and test. I’ve been in constant fucking sharp pain every single fucking day for the past 13 yrs. I’m so pissed because every doctor passed it off for a normal sore back, oh it’s not that bad kinda deal. 

I recently was seen by a pain management specialist 2 months ago and was prescribed 5mg hydrocodone. Whoopdie fucken dooo, it barely helped but it did and improved the quality of my life. I didn’t abuse it and took it as prescribed 2 pills a day/30days. ....... I’ve been on ibuprofen 800 every fucken day for 13 yrs and my tolerance is really high. To day the doc said I’m not upping your dosage nor am I giving you anymore prescriptions cuz you might get addicted. 

Fuck that, so you want me to continue taking ibuprofen, diclofenac, and Tylenol, and up the dosages on that? Wtf I finally had something that worked that made the pain somewhat tolerable and bearable and now you wanna take it away to keep me on shit I told you doesn’t work?

So people who abused it ruined it for guys like me who really need it, fucking great..... fuck you Doc for having the power to help me but not doing it.

As a restaurant manager I constantly have to talk to people, during a shift I get just a few short breaks where I can just be alone. I’ve been doing pills for maybe 8-9 years now, starting around freshman year of high school and perks specially for a little more then half that time and now really trying to get my life together but one of my real problems is work. Like I said before I’m a restaurant manager so I’m constantly going from employees to customers and more then not somebody’s not happy and I have to fix it. Along with a job that requires 45-55 hours a week I’ve been trying to take a couple classes a community college for a degree in business management but the combination of all of that and wanted to quit pills is a lot at once. When I’m high I’m hardworking while still making the best of it, having fun with everyone, very talkative but every time I try to get clean it seems to me to be the opposite, I get a lot of “are you alright”s, all I wanna do is sit in the office and bringing myself to talk to customers is damn near impossible. 

With all that being said I get I’m withdrawing but after that ends am I going to get back to the hardworking, fun, easygoing person I was while I was high? I’ve worked years from being a cook up to manager all while doing more and more drugs as it went on and if I’m not the same person then what happens to my job? My income? My future? 

Just makes me think something if I can learn to control it better I can just get by as a functioning junky of shorts. Sounds terrible in theory but I don’t know what to do, rehab is not for me, I can’t leave my life and job and school for an extended period of time with no questions asked but I really do want to be clean but if I lose everything I know and love I don’t really know if it’s worth it.",1556159390.0

I have my intake set up for Monday to start on methadone maintenance. I’ve been using oxycodone for a few years, and honestly it’s just waaaaay to expensive. I tried suboxone, and I just couldn’t get it. I was good for I think the longest stretch was about 2 weeks. I honestly just couldn’t get past the cravings I just finally caved and used. I kept going back and trying subs and that would last a few days, then go back to oxys again. I also got severe anxiety while on the subs, and my stomach was just really queasy too. I would literally take like 2 bites of food and start getting nauseous as hell, and the smell of everything felt like it was magnified like 1000%. 
But anyway I’m just tired of the chase, lying to my family, stealing money from my husbands business, and just hurting everyone around me. At least with the methadone it would be 85/wk, so I’d be saving sooooo much money. 
I just don’t know how to approach my husband with this. He does Percocet but he can control it. He only does like 5-7.5 mg of them, and that’s plenty for him. Me, if I don’t have minimum like 210 mg a day, I feel like total shit and am in like so much pain. That’s how I started on the oxys to begin with, I have bulging discs in C3-C4, C4-C 5 and L-4-L5, L 5-S-1. I take gabapentin, and cymbalta for the nerve issues and flexeril and oxycodone for pain. I heard that buprenorphine could help with the pain but I didn’t see any relief. I also can’t take any nsaids, I’m allergic and I swell up and break out in hives.
Ok, so how do I approach my husband about the methadone? He’s gonna bring up about me trying the suboxone and that not working. My sister is currently on methadone and he always has nasty comments about it. He’s tired of my spending and using oxys but I really don’t see him understanding wanting to go on methadone. How can I convince him that I don’t want to keep going on the way I am and I feel like this is my last shot at trying something different. I don’t wanna lose my family over the pills, and I can’t just stop. 
And advise would be greatly appreciated.",1556155549.0

I thought I'd post here, because there's great minds here, though I will post in r/drugnerds & a couple opiate recovery/subutex/suboxone subs.

So I've never had a problem with my subutex doctor, hes a genuinely nice guy, & I've never failed any drug tests (dipstick/cup) except my first one obviously to get on the subutex.

But for the last months I've been researching etizolam, diclaz, flublam (briefly) but flualprazolam more frequently & at higher doses. He never tested me since my initial test more than a year ago & trusted me.

Well... today I had to let them test my piss. All because I missed an appointment & rescheduled an appt almost 2 weeks from the appt i missed. I knew I'd come up positive for benzos, so I admitted I had been taking a family member's Valium or Xanax on nights I couldn't sleep (He knows I have minor cerebral palsy & get bad leg cramps & spasms, RLS, & just general sleep issues).

So now I'll be kicked out of the only subutex program in my town. Which sucks, because I planned to taper down my 1 - 3mg a day/every other day dose & switch to kratom, which I have a decent amount of.

I'm starting my diclazepam taper this week because I want off the benzos. Got a lil over a gram of diclaz & a bottle of everclear.

But my next sub appt is in a month from today for Friday at 11:30am. 

Starting my diclaz taper worries me due to its halflife. So I thought diluting it, or using a clean friends piss & adding a tiny amount of water with a tiny amount of subutex dissolved in it & add it to the cup of piss.

That last plan sounds like it might not work because they use a cup test for subutex separately, which I'm sure looks for metabolites..

To accurately do this, it's recommended you crush an entire pill and test it, as simply taking a chip might happen to contain a section with no fent, while fent exists in another part of the pill.  Then you need to either wait a couple days for the water to evaporate, or you can just drink it.  

Here's the thing though - anyone have any experience with this?  Because the pills tested NEGATIVE for fent, even after multiple tests.  To my knowledge I did everything correctly - mixed one tsp water with one 30, mix thoroughly.

I would do them just once or a couple times a week because they were impossible to come by. But one day, I found a solid supply of 10/325 oxys. I experimented with them and at some point, I found my perfect dose. It was 30mg oxy potentiated with 800mg cimetidine (makes it stronger). It was heavenly. It felt like someone had pulled a warm blanket over me and then I'd just nod off and have vivid day dreams. 

My tolerance eventually grew extremely quick with the oxy. I could 10 of the 10mg pills at once and that would *just* be enough to give me a warm buzz. After my oxy ran out, I decided to switch over to smoking #3 heroin. 

I've been doing it for several weeks now, on and off, and no matter how much I smoke, I have not ever gotten that warm blanket feeling I used to get with oxy and other opiates. 

Nowadays when I smoke, all it does it makes me really drowsy, and I nod out. That's still pleasant for me, which is why I keep using, but I really miss the warm blsnket feeling and the euphoria. Those were the best part.

I guess it could be a tolerance thing, but my tolerance really isn't *that* high. I've only been smoking ~0.5g a day of mediocre dope.

Soooo, if someone can tell me if I got this right

Add my h to spoon
Add roughly 5 units of water
Add a small amount of acid
Add heat (not enough to evaporate and bubble water as I did!!!!)

Codeine causes your body to release histamimes, this will cause negative effects. 
So a strong antihistamine commonly promethazine must he takea alongside to combat this.
So more codeine = more prometh, more prometh = more sleepy.

Here's why I think recreationally it's not worth the time of day. 
When I am having a day off or 2 from work I like to use drugs and enjoy activities I enjoy.
Or even just relax anr enjoy the day.
I personally wouldn't want to spend my day sleeping or trying to combat sleep and be mindless.
I feel like that is a waste of limited time before you're back to work.

You also hear lots of people talk about using it in the party scene. Why would you spend your time at a party nodding off on the couch when it's a time of socializing.

I do believe it is great for it's intended medicinal use, when you are ill rest is important so codeine syrup is great at assisting with your rest.
Outside of that I think it just doesn't fit with the idea of recretion.

(Please read details before commenting),"**I realize it's a dangerous combo. Nay, a deadly combo. Possibly the deadliest. But bear with me:** (Everything I'm talking about here is taken orally by the way.)

My opiate tolerance is ungodly. I need the equivalent of 100mg of morphine to get a nice buzz going. 150 to get nice and high. I don't even nod at 200 and I never bothered to test my nodding threshold because money is tight. Even drinking 300ml (~10 oz) of pure 100% white grapefruit juice on an empty stomach 30 minutes before consuming my opiates barely cuts a dent.

My benzo tolerance is even more ungodly if you can believe it. Let me put that into perspective for you: Anything less than 4mg of clonazepam (or the equivalent dose of another benzo) I don't even feel (to the point that if was roofied with 3mg of klonopin I guara-fucking-tee I wouldn't even know). I can act, feel, and look sober to anyone around me on 6mg of kpin. I only start feeling kpin at 8mg (but still look sober). I stop looking sober only at 10mg and above, but I can still walk straight. 2mg kpin used to give me the mother of all blackout amnesias. But now? not even 12mg would do it.

All of that being said, I'm not suicidal so I want to play it safe: To take a mere 75mg IR morphine with an even meager 2mg kpin. But before the other questions, does the order matter?

1. *Would* that be safe for someone who's too tolerant for his own good?

2. If it is safe, would I even feel it?

3. If I would feel it, would the morph potentiate the kpin - or vice versa?

4. Lastly, if you think I won't get high off this combo, what's my next move? How much morp should I add? how much kpin?

***Update Alert:*** About ~1 hour ago I took 75mg morph on an empty stomach (granted I took antacids 2 minutes prior as I've heard it's recommended).

* 30 Minutes In: Absolutely no effect. Not even dilated pupils, so then I took 2mg kpin.

* 60 Minutes In: Feeling warm and fuzzy. No euphoria. No elevated mood. Started to itch. Pupils are normal. (My guess: Opioids constrict pupils while benzos dilate them. Perphaps the two effects cancelled each outher out.)

* Still not satisfied, I just took another 15mg morph. If I see no results in the next 30 minutes I'll be adding 2mg more of kpin. If still no desirable results I'm going to cut my losses and research boofing.",1556096713.0

My PCP and the ER docs surprisingly hooked it up. First ER visit I received 15mg morphine IV which was my first IV experience and it did nothing, not even a small amount of pain relief.  My second visit I received 1mg hydromorphone three times in two hours and it still did nothing. On my last visit I received IV fent which finally helped, but more than anything it made me sleepy and didn’t help with the pain. 
This whole time I was getting decent scripts ( 28 5mg norco, 20 5mg oxy, and then 37 10mg norco). When I was able to leave the couch from my pain I shared with friends and 10mg norco had most of them pretty faded, meanwhile I had to take 70-90mg of norco or 50mg oxy to catch even a slight nod. 
Even from the first norco dose I had to take 50mg to even feel any relief/mild euphoria, and before that I hadn’t chipped in like 6 months at least. So it sucks that I can’t really get any pain relief, but I feel lucky that I have a shit liver and can’t really get high off opiates.

or
150mg Diacetylmorphine (Pharma)

To give you my background:
Chipper.
Current tolerance is at around 15mg Oxycodone to feel nice, 40mg to nod.
Done everything except Methadone and Opana.

I have IV'd Dilly many times in the past and it quickly became my second favourite opioid. I love it, but it is short, albeit powerful and I can get a lot of it.

So here is the deal, I haven't slammed any of the the good stuff in a long time, as you can tell. What would be an appropriate dosage for my current tolerance? Not for the Dilaudid, that's easy. The Pharma-H. I would only IV.

The problem lies with the H. It could last me quite a while with my tolerance and chip eating protocol. 5-10mg is a dose for opioid naive individuals and this is under slow administration of the drug.

I know at this point if I injected 6mg of Dilly I would be flooded by endorphins to the brink of insanity.

Scientific answers and personal anecdotes are appreciated.

Before you may ask, I can't get them both.

I run out in 5 days then spend 3/4 of the month searching for more. I waste so much money on pills that I could spend on a car or even an apartment. my pain is very valid & I will ALWAYS be on pain meds. I went thru 7 days of WD & it was hell. there is no light at the end of the opiate tunnel for people w chronic pain. once we detox, we still have pain and many of us end up being willing to take or do anything to get out of it. I said id never switch to h but today I couldnt handle it. luckily, it wasnt h. 

a guy that likes me offered me some the other day. I dont really trust him that much, so I declined. today I hit him up and asked him to help me out because I was in wd. he did and I met up w him and he told me how much to do & whatever. I get home & snort a little bit. thanks to the help of a fellow opiate user in this sub, I knew how much to buy, what its suppose to look like and what not. I sensed it was fent and so did she. she was right. it was fent. after not having any meds for 24 hours, it hit hard and I likened it to dilaudid or even morphine after not having any for a long period of time. it was extremely short lived & once I felt my skin burn a little and I got a headache, I knew it was fent and only fent. I have a very distinct reaction to fent and sure enough it was. 

I am extremely thankful I was given fent, which not only I hate, but that ive had before so that it didnt become an everyday thing we all know is a slippery slope. I even told the guy I cant wait til he gets subs this weekend bc I much prefer anything but this. I am both thankful and kinda humbled that I was given something ive had before. its kinda like a warning that most people dont get. I dont know. this is a shit post. I am just really thankful is all I can say. so many people wish they could go back to the day they switched & I was “lucky enough” to be duped and given a second chance, despite the fact I fully made the decision. after this I plan on finding ACTUAL pain mgmt.

He calls, I go to meet, and of course he gives me another half g bag and I’m now stuck with a half g of kratom H which I’m obviously going to snort. The antithesis of a good drip. I’m a fucking idiot. Things could be worse though.

TL;DR
Mixed kratom in with some H to make the sack appear heavier and more dense. Got stuck with the bag and am now snorting kratom H 😑",1556042369.0

If I were to quit cold turkey, I'm pretty sure I'd get sent into withdrawals. 

Withdrawals are always what makes me relapse. I'm just a bitch and I can't handle them. My plug recently told me that he can get his hands on Methadone, though. So I thought I would try that.

I'm not very familiar with this idea, but I've heard about doing a ""rapid methadone detox"". Can someone please explain how that works for me. To my understanding, the result of a rapid methadone detox is significantly less severe withdrawal symptoms. Is that true? If so, how many mg of methadone would I be taking, and for how many days would I take it to accomplish this?

I've also heard that kratom can be good for withdrawals. Can it also be used to perform a ""rapid detox"", like methadone? If so, how many grams would I be taking, and for how many days would I be taking it? 

Also, are there any benefits to methadone compared to kratom, or vice versa?",1556035884.0

Basically, I’m an opiate addict and have a pretty solid plug for whatever opiates I need, mainly fake fent pills and heroin. Now there’s been times where I haven’t been in town and my plug has sent me maybe $50-$150 dollars worth of pills in the mail and everything worked fine. 

Now I had an old customer of mine hit me up asking if I could send him 3-4 mexis, about $70 worth. And I said I couldn’t but gave him my plug who had mailed me stuff before. This kid confirmed with me that I could trust him and these were my words down to the letter 

“I mean yea I’ve dealt with him for awhile and he’s sent me stuff thru the mail before but I’m not gonna say 100% either way because I don’t want this to be on me if something happens”

Keep in mind when this kid hit me up he was asking for less then $100 dollars worth of drugs. Well he hit up my plug and for whatever fuckin reason didn’t think twice about sending my plug a fucking grand, without ever meeting the dude or even seeing any proof that the drugs were sent. 

THEN he has the balls to be upset with me, and really fell for the “sorry man send another $500 and I’ll get em shipped I had some complications” bs. Kid blew $1,500 without even considering what he was doing. 

Then goes off on me when I tell him he’s much better off on the dnm. All I’m saying is that no matter who you’re dealing with, most people in this game will burn you if you’re talking about money in the quadruple digits. ESPECIALLY if you’re some random square in another city that he’s never met. I feel partly bad for the kid but like who does this? If there’s any rich Nigerian princes looking to hook someone up with a large sum of money I think I found your man..

I didn’t even lose a thing and I still feel sick to my stomach even thinking about this kids situation. Who starts that big? I’m hoping the dude is rich and can afford that kind of loss because I can’t think of any other scenario where you’d even consider commuting to that but Man.. just a little heads up Incase anyone here is that unaware, ppl in this game, especially the opiate game want your money. If you have business to offer you will probably have a good relationship but $1,500 is probably more then he’d ever make keeping you as an actual customer and they have absolutely 0 actual consideration for your well being 99% of the time so think things thru. Don’t do transactions like these unless it’s thru the dnm or is with a plug you already know well in person.

And to follow that up, does subutex have their own WDs that i will have to deal with, if I were to switch over for the next 5 days? 

I took a small bump of a subutex Yesterday afternoon, 24hrs after my last   Oxy dose, and it made my minor WDs ( sweats, cloudy head, headache, and the un ability to eat) Go away. 

I’m tryna get clean before I go on Vacation so I’m not sick the whole time, but I’m not 100% sure how subutex works in your body other then blocking opioids, and I don’t wanna end up dependent on Subutex, if that’s even possible.

I know this post is going to spark a lot of debate. Believe me I would have been pro Kratom until I saw what it was doing to by body after two years of abuse. 

I was first introduced to Kratom by an ex boyfriend. He was from Colorado and a friend told him about it. We went to the smoke shop and bought one bottle of the powdered Kratom. It tasted horrible. We were told to get the most effective high we would have to mix it with orange juice. Immediate euphoria followed. I also felt like I spent years struggling with depression and anxiety and suddenly I felt focused, friendly, and motivated. I went back two days later and bought more. I loved how it made me feel but the taste was off putting and it was slowly starting to affect my finances. I noticed I was running out of money faster because I started buying the powder almost every other day just to keep up with the tolerance. 

My ex boyfriend and I broke up and I continued to use the Kratom as a means to stay less depressed and have more energy. I continued using for about 7 months and even though I was being paid more at my new job I found I was still going through money like mad. I noticed one week I started to get opposite effects. I became moody and aggressive. I felt no matter how much I took it was making things worse. I decided I was going to go cold turkey off of Kratom. I felt bad for about 2-3 days meaning I had some anxiety but it was manageable. I remember about two weeks after quitting a co-worker came up to me and said to me, ""you look so much healthier... I cant tell what it is but you just do."" I thanked her and moved on forgetting about Kratom. 

About a year later I was driving home from a friends house and noticed the old smoke shop. I remembered I needed cigarettes so I went in. I saw a big sign that said ""Kratom Sold Here"" I made the mistake of asking if they now sold them in capsules. They told me they always have. I decided to buy a bottle. For a couple of weeks I was just using the Kratom on the weekends to relax and have some energy. Then it slowly turned into something I needed on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday... ect.. I was hooked. I had to have a bottle on me at all times. It did not matter if it was storming or snowing or if I was an hour away I would go get it. I would buy 72 capsules for 43 dollars. I would go through a bottle within 2 days and was back at the smoke shop buying more. With Kratom you cannot just take one pill you have to take 6 or 7 per dose to get the effect you want. I was taking 8 pills at a time and re-upping every 2 hours or so. My finances became completely out of control. I stopped shopping for groceries and clothes or any normal necessities. This went on for two years. Kratom had a complete hold on my life. And I was in denial that I had a serious problem with it. 

After about two years I noticed my body started rejecting the Kratom. I would take the normal dose and I would shortly there after throw it up. I became scared and felt trapped in a corner because this had been my crutch for my depression and anxiety for two years. I decided I needed to go into treatment. 

The first thing I did was ask the nurse if he had even heard of Kratom. To my surprise he said, ""yes I have and I'm not a fan."" This was the first time I opened up to someone about my addiction to Kratom. Shortly after I saw a Psychiatrist who told me I must detox off the Kratom. He gave me a small dose of adderall to supplement the lack of energy and focus. The first day off of Kratom I felt fine. I thought this was going to be like last times detox. I would feel bad for a few days then I would return to normal. By the second day I was laying down with what felt like a fever, runny nose, headache, stiff joints, mood swings, aggression, and could only sleep about 2-3 hours It was probably the worst detox I had ever gone through (worse than herion). At the 72 hour mark I could not even leave my bed. I tried getting up once and I blacked out and ended up on the floor. I stayed in my bed for the weekend. I am now 7 days clean from Kratom and I encourage anyone reading this... if you are abusing Kratom...please get help. I had no idea what it was doing to body along with my mental health. If you have any questions please feel free to post and I will answer. 

Thank you,

At long last I was high. With 1mg of Klonopin and 30mg of hydrocodone I sat content and fully entertained.


The common room of the institution was a blank square room with a T.V., tables, and chairs. Sparse “inspirational” posters and drawings adorned the walls, in some effort to make it less depressing. There were always papers and pencils to draw with, and books of sudoku for the patients. But no matter how any of the staff tried it was still an institution.


Without any worries I let the opiates soothe my brain, washing over me like waves on a beach. Opiates make everything pleasant, the people around me felt like old friends, the room was alive, I was alive, and now I was happy. But I knew my clock was ticking…


Mira convinced me to play tic tac toe, so I came back to reality just enough to engage.


“So what brought you across the country?” she asked me, grinning after winning a match.


“Well it wasn't this place… I got in trouble back home and my parents agreed to help me out, a couple years back.” I replied not going into the details of my debauchery.


“What kind of trouble?” she probed raising an eyebrow.


“Drugs and money mostly, some crazy roommates didn't help either.”


I could tell she wanted to know more, but I wasn't about to tell my life story, so I kept it vague.


“What about you? Are you from here?”


“Well not originally, but I've been near the triangle for a while.” she replied.


Before I had the chance to ask more questions a nurse came in with two movies.


“Alright tonight it's The Other Guys or Pulp Fiction.” he said addressing everyone. 


Pulp Fiction was the unanimous winner to no surprise.


“Man movie nights, good food, and a hot new friend? This is a great place to be on a psych hold.” I thought to myself.


There was a strict no touching rule so I resorted to sitting close during the movie. 


As soon as the Heroin scene came on there was an abrupt change in the atmosphere of the room. People sat on the edge of chairs, discreetly rubbing their elbows. Even though I was already high. I found myself doing the same, with a one track mind, remembering the nirvana the movie could never showcase.


By the end of the movie Miras leg rested close to mine. “Maybe when we get out”, I thought, but it would have to wait. Lights out was in thirty minutes so everyone was headed to bed.


“It's good talking to you, another person like me” Mira said getting up to go to bed.


“Yeah it's nice to have company in a place like this. See you tomorrow?” I replied.


“ You can count on it.” She said with a smile, walking away.


In bed I couldn't sleep I was stuck thinking about getting high with Mira. Just a little Klonopin, some alcohol, and opiates or barbiturates for good measure. I knew it probably wouldn't happen but I still fell asleep to the thought.",1555977021.0

I try to half them up usually when I redose so I take 30mg-s at a time a although the buzz seems to linger it doesn't really get me to nodding. Considering that I've built up a bit of a tolerance for these pills lately, would it be safe to dose up to, say 300mg?

Context; Went to the hospital on 27th December from a Heroin overdose which was the wakeup call I needed to get clean, was in the whole deep addiction...

So, anyway, I recently got a new girlfriend. She is not an addict nor does she use opiates, however, she does use other drugs only really alcohol, ketamine, MDMA and weed. However, at the break of her last relationship she had never used drugs then started smoking weed and using MDMA and ketamine heavily to help get over the lad I imagine. 

Now, however, she only uses ketamine and alcohol rarely, but, does smoke weed every day and when she feels stressed or upset smokes weed (which to me as an ex-addict is worrying). She also uses MDMA fairly regularly, roughly once or twice a month. This worries me as I know it is incredibly neurotoxic and have had many friends turn into retards because of over-using it at a young age (she is only 19). 

If anyone could give me any good advice to try and stop her using MDMA and weed as regularly as she does that would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance, TheKugel.

Did it effect your sex drive or sex in general?

What was your appetite like?

The first few days of starting subs, did you still feel some wd symptoms?

Unless you have the financial resources to conceal your addiction, you are the scum of the world if you choose to consume opiates. 

Nevermind the Reality of the Situation; THE WAR ON DRUGS IS A FLAGRANT VIOLATION OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. Specifically our ninth amendment right to bodily autonomy and privacy (which are supported by the fourteenth amendment which stands mostly as a reconstruction amendment to support constitutional principles that are open to interpretation.) this is the objective truth and anyone who disagrees has been conditioned against their own interest. People will argue that in reality things like the commerce clause make the prohibition of opiates constitutionally viable, but that is false considering the prohibition of drugs has lead to immense levels of human suffrage which has only been exploited and turned into a massive for profit pyramid scheme hell bent on sending more humans into concentration centers where they will be forced into hard labor for doing nothing more than exercising their sovereign right to bodily autonomy.

Methadone clinics exist only because of the social additudes towards drug use and they are based upon nothing more than stigma, discrimination, judeao Christian ideals of morality and social conditioning for the benefit of the prison industrial complex. There is no valid reason that people who struggle with physical opioid dependence should all congregate to the same place almost every day, this medicine should be dispensed at a local pharmacy. I struggle with opioid dependence and I have no criminal history whatsoever, there is no reason I should be forced to go somewhere where a bunch of other struggling addicts, some of which actually are dangerous criminals, also congregate. Never mind the reality that some clinics are obviously clinics and anyone walking into a methadone clinic that isnt concealed is having their doctor patient confidentiality violated. Just because people like us choose to consume opiates instead of the disgusting legal alternative of alcohol doesn’t mean our rights should be trampled on.

It’s easy to see that when slavery ended a new form of slavery began to creep into our country, a silent form of slavery that has been imposed on all of us through fear and intimidation and most are too afraid to speak out because the only people who would advocate for “junkies” are other “junkies” (that word disgusts me by the way.)

Even the World Health Organization states that opioids should be easily accessible to treat chronic pain but unfortunately the war on drugs has created an environment where people fear their doctors. So instead of a doctor patient relationship built on trust and communication you have one built on fear and control and the patient is stuck walking on eggshells to ensure their doctor doesn’t flag them as an addict who is seeking drugs. The WHO also released a paper in July of 2017 stating that global drug (and sex work) prohibition needs to end to remove attitudes of discrimination from health care settings. 

But in America it seems we don’t listen to the advice of those who know better than us because that would be unpatriotic and un-American and wtf do those communist bastards know about drug addiction? (Rolls eyes)

Why has nobody had the balls to argue the constitutionality of drug prohibition within our system? Is our system that corrupt that anyone who stands up instigating this type of rhetoric is mowed down and stuck to rot in one of the many for profit prisons that benefit the wealthy who have continued enslaving our society even after slavery ended? Is there no legal counsel out there willing to stand up for the rights of the many for fear that they will loose their job/ standing as a legal professional?

Slavery was once a legally regulated industry and right now all the industries enforcing and regulating punitive measures against drug users are operating unconstitutionally and illegally. If a law is unjust you are not only right to disobey it, you are obligated to.",1555949616.0

Institutions are not nice places, they're a game. “yes” to this, “no” to that, and “sure I'll try blank medication”, always made for the quickest way out.


This time I was in a rehab and psych institution, about an hour away from Tar Heel central.


I ended up here because two days ago I made a fatal mistake. I told my therapist that suicide had been on my mind for a while. Even though the night before, my best friend asked me to be his best man. Therefore by my logic I had something to live for, and it wasn't an active thought anymore. My therapist disagreed, and I was immediately sent to the E.R. psych ward.


After 24 hours at the university hospital, the staff had reviewed my records. They probably  decided from my extensive history of visits, Oxy, Klonopin, and antipsychotic prescriptions to send me away. 


An hour after I was told I was being transferred a black, no nonsense looking, female, state trooper came through the only door.


“J SMITH!” she bellowed throughout the entire area.


Shaking, unsure, and in the beginnings of withdrawal, I stood and walked slowly over to her.


“Birthday?” she said calmer now, sensing I wasn't going to be a difficult patient.


“08/08/1994”


“Alright let's go then” she said taking my bag of personal possessions.


She held out open handcuffs, I compliantly placed my wrists inside. She mercifully didn't tighten them all the way, and we started walking to her cruiser. In the backseat I struggled with the handcuffs and seatbelt, as she sped down the freeway playing 2000's rap.


“Not the worst ride in a cop car” I thought to myself, as we zipped through traffic.


After arriving I waited to be released from the officers duty to the institutions care. After 15 minutes a nice man noticed me, while walking down a hallway.


“You ate?” He half mumbled, while handing me a lunch box.


“Great shitty, pre made, and reheated food”


I opened the box and to my surprise found chicken pasta, French bread, and a brownie.


“Huh… Maybe I won't hate this place”


After being fully signed in I was given most of my clothes back except my laces and hoodie pull cords. They provided me with my own box of hygiene supplies and showed me to my room. I was even told I could shave, provided there was a nurse watching.


My room was the usual long stay psych setup, minus a roommate which was ok with me. Two beds, two dressers, a bathroom with a curtain, and a camera.


I tried to make friends and act interested to show my inevitable psychiatrist I thought life was worth living. During free time I quickly found the junky kids like me. Eagerly we waited as lunch meds were dispensed by last name. 


I waited in the unofficial line, made up of six schedule 2 dependent patients. all waiting for their tiny afternoon fix. 


When my name was finally called I was given my old meds that they had on file, but I had no reason to complain. Two 7.5/500 Vicodin, 1mg Klonopin, and 800mg of Motrin sat in the little cup. Saving the Vicodin for last I cheeked both, and opened for a mouth check.Satisfied, the nurse sent me back to free time. I quickly made it to my room to retrieve and hide my pills in my suitcase.


Back in the recreation area during, a self harm strategies class, I found Mira. She was completely stoned out, after receiving no afternoon meds. She sat,her head leaned back, like she was a wall support. She was attractive gymnast type, but truthfully I wanted to know what had taken, not her number.


“Hey is it cool if I sit here?” I said sliding into the chair next to her.


“Sure.”


“I'm J”, introducing myself.


“Mira”, she blankly said.


“So why are you in here?” I cautiously probed.


“I tried to take myself out with a bottle of Klonopin. You?”


“Rubbing alcohol.” I replied.


Mira was obviously someone I wanted to get in with. A friend with a K-pin script, is a friend worth having. We sat together, in class I  made her laugh and tried to set myself up in the “drug zone”. That's where I wanted to be, after learning she didn't always take her scripts…


Throughout the next three hours there were classes on coping methods and rehab strategies. It was the usual experience just be chill, don't be friends with the crazys, cheek your meds from lunch to get high after dinner, and hang out with Mira.


By dinner time Mira was the closest thing I had to a friend in this place, we ate together as she told me about doing the ribbons in gymnastics. After I mentioned coming from California she was full of questions. Have you been to L.A.? How's the beach, Lake Tahoe, San Francisco?


I patiently answered her questions as thoughts of my evening dose began to invade my mind… I hadn't  had any opiates in weeks.


“Mmmmm… how sweet it will be…”


After dinner I constantly watched the clock, willing it to move to 7 for medication time. We watched the news, while drinking the decaf “coffee”, that was always available. 


As soon as the clock showed 7 the dispensing started. I cursed everyone who was ahead of me, constantly checking to make sure the Vicodin were still in my pocket. 


“Smith” an older nurse called out.


Almost jumping to attention, I made my way to the counter.


“Here you go Mr. Smith”, handing me my cup of antipsychotics, antidepressants, Klonopin and Vicodin. 


Her name tag said “Hellen”, god bless Helen…


“Thank you Hellen” I said after swallowing the pills in one mouth full.


Quickly I headed to my bathroom for some privacy and popped my stash.


“Now we wait” I muttered to myself as I walked back to the common room.",1555903792.0

I was just released from the hospital, for pancreatitis, I have a cyst on mine from drinking too much. I also went there for neck issues, found out I'm gonna need surgery within 6 months.



I usually self-medicate, don't we all, at home or on the street. My piss keeps coming up as a dilute for my PO. My ex said, "" just go through a doctor's scum, them you wont have to worry about Pissing dirty, you'll have scripts!"".



Not that easy, I found. So .... After a week of feeling like shit, I go in. They treat me like the drunkie I am, but not the human I am. They transfer me, again. I'm high, I talk shit about the nurse in my face lying about morphine, telling me she was giving me thorazal .... I'm in a better department.



After days of being on morphine, and hydro, then oxy.... After being released, and me coming to my somewhat home, I found out that my prescriptions were given to a place that I haven't lived it for 2 years, given that I've been homeless for two years and I told the hospital exactly where to release the prescriptions. So I called so many places, and I'm very nice and quiet. I get the rough end from so many chicks, and they're acting like I'm some sort of an ass-whole because their doctor screwed things up ... chewing things in my ear, pretending not to be themselves and taking down my information again. Well at that point, I wanted to talk to a manager, I really did. But I sat there and I waited for my drugs.



All I want is to be happy well fake happy, and leaving the fear that I know behind me cuz it always is.",1555896456.0

Before then, fentanyl was most often made by single, morally ambiguous chemists with access to high quality materials. This all changed when China got a taste of the money to be made. Around this time the Deep Web flourished and international connections were made exploiting any financial arbitrage. The few Chinese labs that made fentanyl were getting hit hard with orders and they realized the demand. More caught on and the government was slow to react as it was not a local drug problem for them and possibly as revenge for the opium wars. All kinds of savvy criminals saw the opportunity in importing fentanyl but they did not have the skills to dose it correctly, leading to 'hot-spots' and overdose deaths around the country. Organized crime took notice and realized that if it was dosed correctly, they could make a huge amount of money swapping expensive heroin supply chains to single electronics sized boxes coming from China. There was a period where they phased out heroin and phased in fentanyl. The problem was that the market responded negativly. People did not like the synthetic feeling of fentanyl, with its lack of euphoria and its tendency to cause breathing problems when that eurphoria was finally reached.
This was the turning point, the Manhattan Project of the drug war. They realized by mixing various synthetic opiates which now came in over 20 different types, they could mimick the short term rush combined with the long term pleasant high by very specifically combining synthetic opiates with different half-lives. Now the market made the switch, people who thought they were doing heroin were actually doing a mixture of fentanyl analoges and other synthetic opiates. The dosing process was perfected and what used to take a small country full of poppy fields could now be shipped into critical markets in a shoebox. That is the first nuclear level problem, the Chinese were making metric tons of fentanyl with no blowback and import could not be stopped. A single drug mule swallowing balloons could import enough to feed an entire metropolitans city for a day or two.
This is around the time I quit and got on Suboxone therapy, when it was just plain fentanyl replacing the heroin I would get annoyed with the boring rush and the side effects, having a 50/50 chance of scoring my drug of choice or a cheap, boring replacement. This brought the cost down to where organized crime became interested in the previously very expensive heroin market, with a dose of synthetic opiates costing orders of magnitudes less the higher up in the supply chain it was purchased.",1555855585.0

Lastly I have a rather silly embarrassing question but hope somebody here can at least relate even if they don’t have an answer. Will I be able to get high on these meds? 
I have this crippling fear that I’m not going to be “high” anymore. I’m not gonna be able to coast through this like I do life by just wrapping my consciousness up in an opiated bubble. And that scares me. I’ve done it for so long. I understand I won’t be sick but will I get the mental relief? I don’t mean nodding out kinda high I just mean high enough for me to be comfortable with daily living, or does maintenance not work like that? I can see why it wouldn’t of course but I’d like to hear it from the horses mouth.

The worst for me was definitely something I'm mildly scarred by now. And its all thanks to Jack Black.

I was withdrawing. This was at the early days when it wasn't as severe. So I go out with my girlfriend to see... Tropic Thunder. Now, if any of you recall, Jack was a heroin addict in the movie. I was trying to distract myself and it backfired. So the whole movie he's withdrawing. And at the end there's a pile of heroin and he's all torn between using it or not. I just remember the incredible discomfort of the moment. Wasn't addicted to H but I used pretty strong opioids. I felt like I was dying during the movie.

Anyway, felt like sharing this for ages but never knew who to tell it to. Let me hear some stories if you got any.",1555835923.0

I’m a 24 year old girl, had a habit on and off for a few years. Last time I was clean was like 8 or 9 months ago. Anyways I’ve been taking like 4-6 or sometimes like 8 blue 30’s a day. Really whatever I can get my hands on I’ll take lol. I used to take real ones but for the last few months I’ve been snorting fake ones because they’re stronger. Probably fent in them, the guy who sells them to me swears it isn’t but I doubt it. Anyways I’m not going to have any money for the next week, Maybe longer due to some unforeseen shit circumstance and I only have $100 left then that’s it, this girl (me) is so fucked lol, so looks like I’m detoxing. I can either:
A: get about 5-6 more of these fake ones and stretch them out as long as possible then I have a pretty much unlimited supply of subutex to take once I run out and take those for a few days and try to ween off
Or
B: get about 10 10mg methadone pills and try taking those? I took like 7 at a time a few weeks ago and only they seemed to only work for 12 -15hours and I was hurtin again so I’m nervous to do this because what if I fuck myself and only get one good dose?

The reason I’m scared of option A is because Ive taken subs twice now and each gone into PWD. Worst. Experience. Ever. The only thing that got me out was taking more fake ones and I had to go thru hell for like 6 hours. But It’s subutex not suboxone and yes I know it’s the bupe not nalaxone that makes you sick. I’m just so afraid to take it again. I waited like 12 hours last time I guess that wasn’t enough. It works fine when my friends do it thats why idk why it won’t work for me. So what’s everyone’s opinion here.",1555816429.0

Figured when a woman who worked their asked if I wanted to try a new flavor that she ment a vape cart😂, not a thc cart. Immediately noticed it was oil but could not resist a nice inhale once I tasted that fruity oil cart. Did not get free food.

After all the shit, sweat, nightmares and tears I finally got clean. I was able to welcome my sister home from school with a pretty set of eyes rather than the glossed void leading to anything but me.

She was here for one day before I got in touch with the middle man, who struggles just like I do. He got me what I wanted because he knew I felt shitty but this was the first time he told me that he respected me because I was the only one in the game that never gave him shit. Never gave him hell for getting arrested with my money. Never asked him to hurry up. Never asked to replace the funds he lost. He told me it hurt him bad each and every time he scored for me.

I have this burning, aching love for each and every soul on this earth that suffers the game of life. I respect everyone for the fight that goes on for each and every one of us. I snuck out my window in bare feet to retrieve the cure from down the road after it was dropped near my home. Stepping in puddles and tripping without a damn care. Upon sneaking in I heard the dog move in my mothers’ room, so I stuck the dope under the bed and began watching videos.

Waited thirty minutes until I finally decided it was the appropriate time to feel better. This was the first time I spent someone else’s money. I made sure all was quiet in the home and racked it up. I took it...

I just started fucking crying. I have everything in the world going for me still even after a few months of active addiction. Scholarships to university after years of struggle in community college engineering programs. I have the most beautiful and loving family that transcends what words can say.

Here I am. High as a kite. Alone in a dark room just as I had planned.

And now, for the first time in my entire life, after all the detoxes and probations and death...

I realized just how sad I am.

I truly, undoubtedly love you all so much.

I make no claim to being special, each and every one of us deserves the chance to make a difference in this world. I would die if it meant getting just one addict clean.

But I am the addict. I am the one that is willing to suffer to change the world, and I cannot even allow myself that.",1555813800.0

&#x200B;

I'm a 26-year-old living with my parents for the next 6 months due to weird circumstances with my previous roommates. They (my family) know I use, so they forced me to close my previous bank account and transfer it over to a joint bank account so they can monitor my activity. I'm fortunate enough to make a lot of money for my age, but taking out cash is painfully obvious. Even if I go to a grocery store and get cash they'll know because I don't otherwise spend $100+ dollars at Target.. Unfortunately, my tolerance is at the point where I need at least 120mg of oxy to catch a buzz. They do not drug test me, but that really doesn't make a difference if they can see what I'm doing with my money. It's super embarrassing considering I'm a college graduate with a good career that I've worked hard for. I shouldn't be dealing with this shit from my parents who make maybe half what I do. It's only temporary, but it still fucking pisses me off regardless. I'm usually smart enough to figure a way around this, but I can't. Any advice?",1555787867.0

Well that's just it...I usually have my ***ritual/tradition*** on ""***cheque day / welfare day***"" that consists of: walking towards center town to *safe-site\** to pick up fresh new equipment. They give me a fresh *5 pack\*\**, with a bottle of water + juice crystals and complimentary granola bar - but they always only have fig bars left. I grab what I came for, and begin to turn around, and start the walk back-home direction till I get to my source, while calling since the night before to prevent a mishap in my pick up....  and then continue the walk home pit-stopping only once, @ the Quickie. That's where I make sure to stock-up on certain things in case I blow my cheque before I get to see this white rabbit again. 2x Pack of smokes, Lighter, Visine, pizza pops, noodles, pop, Aloe Vera (regular kind), Miss Vickies Chips, and if I feel like splurging I might grab some smart water - while laughing that this stuff don't make you smart, except it just might maybee. All that I get ends up being about $40. **Always**.  On the odd month, I like add a XL Slushy to my order, and fumble around for extra change for it - but while I already filled it... and I already got what I came in for. **The guy at the Quicky will usually say:** *""Don't worry about it bro.. - have a good day"".*

*And so as I am fumbling around in thousand n 1 pockets, he hits me with a* ***good day - and not to worry*** *. So I'm on my way out now.*

As I am 12 steps into the rest of my way home, making my way out of the store...  I hear a punjabi voice : ""**excuse me sir ... sir! - you drop something"" .**    Now I knew it couldn't have been my *inner-voice ,* because my inner-voice is redneck as ph\*ck.   I stop dead in my track, as I acknowledge him slightly with a thank you before I notice what it is. (*all without making eye contact)....* I look down, and there it was: a one off, of my long tips in the wrapper + blue rubber tourniquet wrapped'round that just happen to fumble it's way out.

I felt ashamed, embarrassed. I felt like the crackhead/junkie that my mother calls me every chance she gets - clean or not.

At my peak I was taking 500mg of tramadol a day, for about 7 months, luckily I never had a seizure, even though I often mixed the 500mg with 2mg of xanax. During this time being I felt wonderful since I always had my ways around with scripts so I had an endless supply of pills. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless I had to taper off the pills for various reason and it's been one week since I popped some tramadol, and needless to say I feel horrible. The physical WD's were horrible for about 3 days then it went away but the psychological WD's are killing me. I'm always hanging out with friends and smoking mad weed to distract myself but I always end up craving this wonderful feeling that is the warmth of Tramadol.

A research article on the drug Tianeptine. It states that the behavioral effects of the antidepressant requires the mu-opioid receptor.,"I have used tianeptine recreationally and was not prescribed it from a doctor, a version of it was sold as a “dietary supplement” in gas stations throughout the southeast. It had great antidepressant effects and I believe this was mostly due to the fact that it’s a full agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. Could this change the way we view opioids/opiates in the treatment of depression?
*Edit*: It does claim tianeptine does not lead to tolerance or withdrawal and I disagree with that statement because I have experienced the hellish withdrawals from continued use of this drug.

If you take to much just dulls the codeine high?

Obviously so many doctors are extremely hesitant to start patients on hydrocodone and above (took me almost a year to find a doc) but tapentadol being about a third as potent as morphine might make it desirable for pain relief without the same level of abuse liability.

as a disclaimer: im not bad mouthing the sub.
i know diferent people like different drugs wich is fine but just from my point of view as a heavy opiate user i cant help but be very amused by that sub because it reads like its the child or 
r/opiates if that makes any sense. one post on there i read today hit it om the head: there are only a few types of posts on here and they are: is my shit real/good, how much should i do/pay, look at the shit  i got and  how do i get it?
the reasons  i find it funny is that i look fondly on people asking about the dosage of codiene seeing as it has a bioavailability  threshold   way lower then what it would take to OD for just about anybody.  the  prices they pay also makes me laugh seeing as theyll  pay $800 for 1500mg of codiene  wich i could buy otc for $30 😂 i mean perspnally  at this point codeine  is completely  pointless for me to do due to my dilaudid tollerance , shit even oxy dosent do it for me anymore. but i have had a codiene script from the ages of 13- 18 and even then  i didn't find much recrrational  value to it, ive also gotten scripts for lean and its abundantly clear that  the  antihistamines (promethazine) is what makes you high since it potentiates  the codiene. i also find it funny how people  make fake lean and who can blame em since its so lucrative  but im really mind boggled  how this exorbitant value was established, but thats what really makes me laugh  that  people pay  **$1000** for the morphine miligram equivalent  to an oxy 40 😂 wich as im sure u all know its waay overpriced if it costs you even $40.  like ok the drug is the drug and its fine if people like it  but the dealers who set that price and the users who are willing to pay it is just too funny. like getting a script for lean is one  of  the easiest things to do i could get several every day if i wanted to even in this day and age.  i guess its the novelty factor. anyways like i said im not trying to talk shit about the sub its simply a forum for the lean community  but the community and market itself os just fuckin hilarious all around. so to r/lean i say :to each thier own it obviously dosent bother me if you  want to do lean instead of other opiates but  im willing to bet that most of you arent even aware that you dont get high off codiene, oxy , hydros  you get high off of what they are metabolized into in your body and its all...MORPHINE!!   yep however you take it and whatever opiate you buy ( with a couple exceptions) they all end up being the exact same thing in your body the only differnce is bioavailability,dosage  and price.  if you wanna do  try lean just go to the doc and say uve had a cough for 6 months and that ur allergic to those two ingredients  in ever otc cough syrup or even buy it one time but for your own sake  just try  buying  any another  prescription opiod  at least once ,dose accordingly, add some $5  otc antihistamine (bebadryl, prometh wtv)  and tell me that  it wasnt exaclty the same  or better for much much less.  


tldr: i find r/lean very funny because  i view it fondly as a sub of people  who are on thier way to us but ironically are spending waay waay more than we ever would on thier habbits  (about $1000 for a pint wich is the morphine  mg equivalent  of a  single $20-$40 40mg oxy) and have  pretty much the same product quality,dosage  etc. problems we do but  but are  only  as dire  as a  small  fraction of  the scale  of ours. o yeah did i mention how much  they spend 😂?",1555704580.0

In a web I saw that mepiridine or petidine cannot be mixed with methadone due a interaction, but i don't know more about it.

I'm on methadone since almost a month, started with 30mg per day and since 9 days ago the dr upped my dose to 40mg due tolerance, I had some withdrawal symptoms at the end on 30mg. Well, the last weekend I don't know how, but 2ml (10mg) lacked in my last dose of Sunday because the PMM is closed on weekends. I took 30mg instead 40mg due this on the morning, and on the nigh I was in an extreme generalized pain in all my body, was unbearable a fucking hell, I almost couldn't walk for the pain. I'm suffer of chronic pain since almost one decade (for that reason I started on opiates by medical prescription). Then I went to urgency of my private insurance, I told the situation to the dr and he said to the nurse that inject me 10mg of diazepam IM and 50mg mepiridine IV. I felt great almost instantaneous, without any kind of pain, really relaxed, seems like I was walked in the heaven between clouds. Never tried mepiridine before, because where I live just is comercialized for hospitable use, not for prescription in pills. And excluding tramadol a few years ago in urgencies too, was the unique strong opiate I tried IV, for medical reasons.

Well, that was on Sunday-Monday at midnight. On Monday I started with my usual dose of methadone everyday of 40mg, but on Wednesday at night I had an awful withdrawal symptoms, I took 6gr of kratom red vein borneo in less than half hour and I took diazepam 10mg but I was very fucked yet. Then I took one oxycodone 5mg IR I had in my stash, and in 20 minutes I felt great without any withdrawal symptom.  

Do you think this could happened for the interaction of mepiridine and methadone? Or maybe because 72h later after the 50mg of mepiridine injected I could entered in withdrawal? Or could be the tolerance of methadone that is rising and maybe I need an adjustment in the dose? 5mg more for example.

Hope your opinions and your tips. Thanks in advance guys.",1555698126.0

My fucking pill bottle (oxycodone, 15mg) was in my hand; he didn't even ASK for a pill count. I tried twice to get a word in and he would just cut me off and say, ""I'M JUST GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE"".. Thus, I could never explain to him that I simply fell asleep early after work the day before and didn't take my evening pill.

He then gave me only half of my normal script.. so #42 pills for exactly 14 days and said I had to start coming in twice a month (so he can double his monthly co-pay from me at $40 a pop). He then said after the next two scripts, he would be taking me off the medication and putting me on medical marijuana instead.. and to bring $150 for the application. LO'fuckingL.. So anyway, fed up with the scrutiny, interrogations, false accusations and petty behavior.. I gave him the script back and mouthed, ""fuuuck yoooou"" and walked out.

Kratom is illegal here in my state (hence why I even ended up taking opioid medication for my chronic pain issues in the first place), so I went back to my GP who initially referred me to pain management. He was originally prescribing me #120, 10mg Hydrocodone, #90 Klonopin and #90 Gabapentin every month; without issue. I just felt that the hydro wasn't lasting long enough an was tired of popping pill after pill - so the plan was to hopefully be scripted oxycontin, dilaudid or some other type of ER medication.. but nope, this dickhead pain management doctor somehow figured that a 15mg oxy would cover pain for EIGHT HOURS. Sorry, I digress.. so I go back to my GP - who is a super legit physician that is compassionate, patient, understanding and doesn't judge you for being honest. I don't abuse my meds and I don't ask for more than I need, so he takes care of me. I explained the situation to him and BAM - he writes me four scripts; one for my blood pressure, cymbalta (new), #120, 10mg hydro and then without me even asking, increases my klonopin to .5mg, x3 day (was taking x2 day).

Sorry for the long, boring rant.. I just had to get it out and then share the obligatory ""refill"" photo; as I always enjoy seeing others pics when they score:) Hope everyone is comfortable and taken care of today.. and if not, best wishes on getting well soon. Peace and empathy to anyone hurting or in WD; you have my utmost sympathies from someone who back in the day abused everything from heroin, oxymorphone, fent, morphine, hydromorphone, etc. to the tune of approx $80k between 2012 and 2015.. it's been a long dark road. Happy nods to the soldiers and feel better soon to anyone just dealing with chronic pain - cheers

bf0fcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/bf0fcg/oxy_withdrawals_sleep/,12,https://redd.it/bf0fcg,KnowTheConversation,Oxy Withdrawals & Sleep,"Hi y'all,

Stumbled on this forum while looking for WD advice. Figured I'd tell my story and hunt for some feedback. Skip towards the bottom if you don't want the context, just the question. 

I've been a casual recreational user of opiates for over 10 years now, and had always been under control, doing maybe 15-20 7.5mg hydros a month for the majority of that. No problems, withdrawal, cravings, whatever. 

Well flash back to two months ago, I'm with my weed guy, who has another guy at his place...convo turns to opiates, he whips out some of those oxy 30 blues with the M in the square, talkin' bout how fun they are. My normal rec dose was 22-25mg, so it didn't feel like a big bump up, I was flush with cash, so I thought 'fuck it, let's go on a little bender.' Something I've done before with the hydro, with no ill effects. So for a few weeks I was doing those blues once a day...then it became twice a day for a couple more weeks. After a month I figured I was done...but I began having early withdrawal sweats and anxieties, realized this was more of a problem than I realized, and resolved to self-detox when I could break away from my life/partner/work for a little while. Unfortunately, that opportunity didn't come for another month or so, and towards the last 10 days of that I was up to 3 30s a day because why not, right?

However, I'm a self-possessed guy so I didn't have a problem leaving town, booking a nice hotel in a big city, and just suffering through it. I'm 6 days' in now, and the worst of the acute withdrawal symptoms are fading, though at peak they were intensely hellish (I can't imagine what the heavier/longer-term users on here have to deal with, I have immense amounts of sympathy and respect for those of you that manage to get through that without using.)

My main problem at this point is sleep. I have slept 2, .5, 0, 1, & 1 hours the past 5 nights, I've tried CBD, tylenol pm, benadryl, nyquil pm, melatonin, st. john's wort, valerian root, showers, baths, fuckin' warm milk, asmr, ambient scandanavian music to focus on...nothing helps, I toss & turn all night and usually after going to bed around midnight and trying desperately to make it work, I'll get a wink before the sun comes up. I feel in my waking hours like I'm starting to become incoherent, and I've only got two nights left to fly solo before I have to head back to my partner...and I'd rather not tell them about all this, having gotten into it and working on getting out of it on my own...but there'd be no getting around it if I'm in this state when Sunday rolls around. 

So, given my timeline/dosage, do you guys have any advice on how long this insomnia is going to last, or anything I haven't tried that might help? Thanks for reading and I appreciate any advice.",1555687761.0

Be safe my fellow junkies, shits heavy out here, my dope doesn’t even have fent I test it every other batch or so and I still went out but I also blew a .25 at the hospital like an hour after my last drink so I was also just being retarded but that also makes it easier to try to excuse to do it again. I dunno, I probably shouldn’t do it all, my DOC is meth but I don’t do it often cause I love it so much, last time was New Years. I feel dope might be slowly replacing that though, might have to treat it like ice.",1555671018.0

Having lived in America in the past, but lving in a very anti-drug and conservative country right now has made me abuse prescription drugs whenever I could.

So I found out that Tramadol is an opioid that gives you a opiate-like high and has been abusing tramadol for 2 months now. My tolerance is pretty high now needing at least 600mg to feel the effects. Due to my low supply, I googled ways to potentiate tramadol for days and finally was able to narrow it down to two methods : 1. Staggering the dose 2. Taking other potentiator drugs such as gabapentin, cimetidine, xanax, alcohol, weed, and etc.

As I mentioned before, I am in a very conservative country right now. Out of all the potentiators mentioned above, I only have a few mgs of xanax. (Alcohol too but I personally do not like to drink when I take trams)

After all the googling and studies, I found out that taking tagamet (cimetidine) some time after taking tramadol can potentiate the high.

Unfortunately, I am not able to get my hands on cimetidine but instead I have some ramitidine and was wondering if this will potentiate trams as well.

Also, would having some baking soda or tums (to make your stomach less acidic) potentiate tramadol the same way it potentiates opiates?? How about drinking tonic water some time after taking trams?

Would taking daily supplements such as multivitamins, fish oil, coq10, silymarin help??

These are the list of drugs I have: Xanax / naproxen / lexapro / aceclofenac / celecoxib / ranitidine / trazodone Would any of these help? I know xanax does but dk abour others..

Damn I am so frustrated how I have to find ways to potentiate tramadol in extremely limited ways.. Would appreciate some help here.",1555664344.0

Junkie sciences approach:
Stop 12 mg sub immediate. 
Next day, to day 3 or 5, use. Abuse. Whatever.
Broken the big sub addiction, use long enough to pass the main wds. Then taper over 3 days: 8, 4, 2.
Would thay really address the acute sick and get me out? Inside a week. 3 weeks to recover before work. I'll need as long as I can get. 

Non junkie science:
- already 18 to 14 for 48 hrs.
- negative 2mg more tomorrow. 12mg.
- continue dropping twos till I get to about 3 weeks away, and try to stabilize and deal with the rest 1 mg a month after that.

Sound at all feasible?

My new life and experience off opiates below,"Where do i start?  87 days ago I woke up to my lines of dope on my nightstand.. I hit em hard and called my boss to tell him I needed help... I was living in Chicago sniffing hella dope and popping 15 Klonopin on the plane on the way to rehab at 160 lbs and now I'm 185 lbs stupid healthy and living out west (from the east). I live in a 1.5 million dollar sober living house with plenty of space and comfort for 1200 a month (cheaper than my chicago spot)  I am great shape I workout 4 or 5 times a week and i go hiking every Sunday with a ""normy"" friend I met on bumble.  I also play basketball at the gym with my childhood friend who moved here last year. 

My experience....I don't have a car and it sucks to bum rides but it's whatever.  There is STUPID money out here lotta old money and a lotta new money self made and trust fund babies who took advantage of their situation.  I like talking to people about their buisnesses and getting to know the ropes.  Because of my situation I don't feel I am right for AA.  I soak up what I can at the meetings but I don't work the steps and I probably wont.  I wasn't a deadbeat I supported my addiction I didn't steal and I never oded.  Basically if its not the AA way its YOUR way but both might work and both might not.  I said at a meeting im doing it my way and that if you're hiking to the top of a mountain you don't have to take the hardest trail...the easier trail leads to the top too.  

A story worth noting
(I dont call this a relapse) 14 days ago I went out with my ""normy"" friend and i got drunk.  I was on my level hitting on every sexy girl I could and if they rejected me I didn't let it affect my mood it was just on to the next one...i had a black tee and Levi straus tight blue jeans I borrowed from my friend that weighs 60lbs more than me and old air maxes ... No buss down rolly no car no hurricane Harvey on my neck but this didn't stop me from approaching this bad bitch and making her mine for the night...ireland transplant dark features but blue eyes and one of the dopest asses ive seen yet...she had a heavy accent using words like cunt and wanker which turned me on bc it was different.. She was really down to earth and fun to hang out with ...we left the bar together and I brought her to the hookah bar next door..? By 3 am I was sipping henny with her, her hand laid up on my leg and me making drunk jokes to her saying freaky shit like you can sit on my face when we get back to your crib (turned out it wasn't a joke) ...as I spit my game ego on astronomical levels, these herbs across the hookah bar from me watch closely with their 1000 dollar louie and gucci outfits that they ran up a check on, which made me feel even more like the man .... To cap the story off She said ""you better fuck me good if I take you to my place""... Of course I said ""say no more!""  Off to her crib not far away and it was OVER. I accomplished my goal for the night.  

Needless to say this was a MAJOR ego boost and if you read this far you can tell I still like my vices 😆..i love hitting on women I'm probably a sex addict and I like filling voids..(I also rented an exotic car for a few days the week before that) ...but this doesnt mean I have to sniff dope and do other drugs people!  I think it's prudent to also say that I feel like I'm learning to love myself now ... Like I really feel like I'm never touching drugs again .... I even smell weed (its everywhere out here) and I'm not phased ... I'm a little bit upset with myself for drinking just over pussy but hey I still feel great and I don't regret it... I moved on from that awesome night..pleasure is temporate (as well as pain)  I have my good days and my bad days but i get through them without substances thats what is most important...i should also note that they dont test for alcohol so I know I could get away with it again and I  had many more opportunities to drink and chose not too... Rather than drink a bloody Mary that Sunday I ran off the hangover playing basketball at the gym .... ONLY reason I felt any guilt at all was bc of the setting i live in at the moment...

To close with positivity for all opiate addicts out there
we can all get through this... We are all smart and creative people.  We just have to channel our energy in the positive direction not the negative one.  Don't run from your emotions, recognize them, contantly be mindful and check yourself as quickly as possible..bring yourself back to humility... BE PATIENT it will not come to fruition overnight... not all of you may be able to pull this off getting drunk once in a while but no one knows you like yourself don't let anyone tell you differently...I literally feel like I got it out of my system ... I can seem sociopathic at times but best believe I am aware of it... I like my character defects I don't want to be some even keeled boring guy.. and I havent even felt like drinking since... You won't ever catch me drinking alone if I ever have a drink in the future it will only be to enhance my social event ...Best believe i still count my clean time...alcohol is not the same thing as dope idc how you slice it ...you still need self control but opiates are another animal people....I really feel like I'm a new man ... I live in a new city and the health and business vibes out here are on another level... I've never felt so inspired to be the man in my life ... I'm going to take a real estate course this summer and continue to grow ... Be perrenial learners people... Put in the work to grow and sustain the growth ....accept change and most importantly love yourself... We fucked up but everyone fucks up we are human and far from perfect but we can strive to be better....own your addiction ... Know which lines You crossed that You can't come back from...You are not powerless .. Shit if I was powerless I would not have gotten this far ... Anyway that's all I got",1555656898.0

Its about the treatment I got in a research study for monthly Bupe injections. Im pretty sure it was 2015 when I decided I wanted to get clean and found out about this study. It was being done at a nonprofit drug clinic close to me. After my initial acceptance into the program I had to prove I was addicted by showing up with withdrawls. Then sign all the papers for it,  which included stipulations like i cannot drink grapefruit juice, and I have to use birth control when having sex (condoms,etc) because they dont know what the affects could be during pregnancy. 

So I got in. They paid me with gift cards each appt I had. I constantly had UAs,  blood taken, a machine with the nodes hooked to my chest reading whatever it was reading idk.  And ofcourse I had monthly bupe injections, that slowly released over that 30 days. They had 2 strengths available and let me choose,  I always chose the stronger one. The injections would be given into my lower stomach area, in 4 places that rotated. It actually hurt pretty good when they put that needle in me and slowly pushed the bupe dose in, burned like hell. 
Not that this was a bad experience. I got clean, got paid to do it, and didnt have to do any of that group stuff or NA. We did have a counselor assigned that I would see one on one once a week. But thats it. I actually had a lot of fun coming in, all the ladies there were really nice and chill. 

Anyway. I did that for 18 months. It was suppose to be a year study, then got extended. The shots work very well and theres no going back, couldn't have got high if I tried. I know the plan is for this to be on the market soon. So I wanted to throw it out there that there is someone here that has done it and I can try and answer any questions anyone might have about it. One thing though, it lingered in my body longer than it was suppose to. It has its own natural taper because of the way it works, which is nice. But I really wanted to test my tolerance after being clean for about 20 months and could not get high at all. Took an extra 3 to 4 months longer than expected to finally wear off. So heads up on that. 

I actually was in to see them today for my very last visit. Several years later. They have been checking to see if there are any amounts of bupe left in my system still. Some of the others have had trouble passing UAs for work or drug court because of how long this shit stays inside the body. There are still trace amounts that are inactive they said. Like .04 micrograms in me or something. I was told I had a lower amount than the others that were in the study. 

Well thats my story in a nutshell, Im sure I left some stuff out, but whatever. If you read it all than thanks for your time. Im down to answer any questions.",1555656058.0

Doc switched my gout prevention drug and gave me 21  tabs of 10-325 Percocet which is my DOC. But even more rewarding...I come home and my wife told my mother in law about my pain recently and gave her a bottle of 20 5-325 (the 512s which I like). As a result...,

1. I’m in very little pain at the moment
2. I’m high AF
3. I spent the last 2 hours talking about baseball with my 7 year old while not In pain....which was a spiritual experience in its self.

But....

I’m at cross roads, I have legitimate chronic pain and Oxy works and truthfully I love the high so much, with that being said....I think it’s a blessing and the world working correctly that I can’t get a long term script. I have gotten constant small scripts over the last 6 months (10 pills here, 20 there) the ortho practice i go to has the PAs, whoever is working call in the scripts so my PMP looks like I am doctor shopping. Truth is, if given a monthly script, I would  abuse and become physically dependent (which has never been the case). I never actually admit it out-loud but I definitely have the addiction gene. My dad is in pain management but it’s really just a doc giving him 120 Oxy 10 per month, he has since 2006. Dad is fucked up all the time. My uncle died of a codeine overdose. Seriously, he took a shit load and died. My grandmother’s trifecta was wine, Valium and bathtubs for hours at a time. My grandfather walked around the house with a cup of Wild Turkey neat.

I love Oxy, how the fuck do I stay away? How can I avoid fucking up my insanely great life?

Just a little backstory, my fiancee and I were full blown pill heads about 3 years ago and got into contact with an older couple (mid 50s maybe) who were slinging Roxy 10's, 15's and OP 80's. They lived in the worst trailer park wed ever seen on the outskirts of Gary Indiana. This area still felt semi safe to us as it was still on the edge of an affluent area. We quickly gained the trust of this couple and we had a GREAT relationship. I knew I could count on them to be good when they said and I could roll by their trailer and grab my stuff and dip out in mere minutes. The wife was always outgoing and asked about us and our relationship and took a genuine liking to us. It made us sad when we quickly noticed the signs of crack abuse and literally watched them deteriorate in the 2 years we worked together. 

Don't get me wrong this couple were straight crackheads and we had our ups and downs. Sold bunk E to us, left us hanging a few times and got into shouting matches with the husband but overall we knew they were very caring, took time to take care of us when we were sick and fronted us in desperate times. They knew we were dumb kids from the suburbs but never took advantage of us. We knew they had an extremely tumultuous relationship (she often sold us pills she stole from her own husband) but we also knew they cared about each other genuinely. 

We eventually had to cut ties when we knew we had a real problem. Besides the random offer for a stove or microwave we hadnt heard from them in awhile. We recently went to find out how they were doing recently only to be shocked by the fact that they had both been murdered in Gary IN. We were both speechless for the rest of the night because we had formed a pretty tight relationship with these people. One of them were literally left in a ditch like an empty pack of smokes. We think the wife got killed and the husband and his bro went for revenge and got in over their heads. We still don't know how to process the whole thing but are just glad we got out when we did.

The whole thing has just been a sobering reminder of how fucked the game really is. This couple literally could have been the people you know from down the street who love to see you in slightly different circumstances. The game don't give a fuck. They probably owed a dealer a few bucks and disposed of them like trash. 

Don't mean to bring y'all down but were just really sad about this and feel that no person deserves this shit and its so sad that our system pushes aside otherwise decent people like this. Please stay safe out there and hug your loved ones whenever you can.

Maybe he only got it for her cuz he knew her, idk man.. but he didn't come back, then I had to fucking leave so I got burned for 40.

That was a big nono as well! People need there green man one way or the other, better your friendly neighbourhood dealer than some Afghanistan Farm or a Cartel. So that tripped me up a bit as well, but mainly just the fact that people who use drugs themselves were not open to the fact that a consenting adult should be allowed to put whatever they want in there body, so long as they’re hurting/effecting anyone else, which i’m not. I would have loved to have discussed (to them it was an argument) with maybe 2 people at the most but i was fighting a battle on several fronts and as soon as i closed one point another was opened so eventually I just deleted the post. Shame, it seems we are.. and will always be labelled nothing more than junkies.. all because you like opiates haha. I’m not fussed I just thought earlier at work i’d like to tell you guys.

It might help to put a but about my back ground, i’m 24 UK earn a very good wage at quite a prestigious company who fortunately don’t partake in RDTs (although i’ve heard though the grapevine they’re trying to push it through but the union isnt having it).

I also have taken 4x 5/325 perc without mixing it with alcohol and ended up smoking weed an hour or so later and was tripping hardcore but no negative side effects. Is the perc going to make me feel the same way mixed with alcohol, should i be worried about throwing up or ODing? please let me know! thanks! ALSO: im 20, 5'3 and around 135 lbs if that helps anyone

He introduced me to Reddit and this page. He has truly opened my mind and heart to addicts. My brother is also an addict. Addiction surrounds me. I promise you though, I'm not empty or lost. 
I would like to say I don't really like to call my brother or my boyfriend addicts.  I understand that have an addiction, but I see them as people before I see them as an addict. I find that to be important. Labeling is a powerful thing in my opinion. I feel as a society we minimize people's worth by labeling people as an addict. If we're going to do that, can we leave the label as objective, without such negative connotation. 
Addicts are not bad people. Some have done morally questionable things, but they're not bad people. Family take their act of addiction and use personally, it's not personal. Everyone is just trying to cope, trying to feel normal I guess. What is normal? Life's a mess. Maybe society should change their view and understand a day in the life of your shoes, then they could begin to understand why you do what you do. My boyfriend loved getting high too. He still does. But he doesn't like being alone on the comedowns..he doesn't life the inevitable withdrawals, and he doesn't like working his ass off to have nothing to show for it. He wants to see a different side of life.

""This is a little counterintuitive, given that cold showers also stimulate noradrenaline, which can feel like panic. The answer appears to be that cold showers also increase levels of beta-endorphin, which binds to opioid receptors the same way as opioid drugs. Beta-endorphin reduces bodily stress and promotes homeostasis, which involves pain management, behavioural stability, and reward.

Mentally, physically and financially.","I know everyone’s different and this maybe personal and if not allowed plz let me know. I’m new. Just wondering how everyone feels about their current situation. 
I like learning and hearing About how people got to where they are and where they plan to go in life.  Like my buddy is a veteran and struggles really bad with pain, ptsd and anxiety.  He is very under treated and under prescribed at the va. He has neck and back injuries and knee injuries from combat. All they give him is tramadol twice a day 50mg and that usually isn’t enough for him. I worry about him all the time because he has to resort to street pharma some times and I feel like it’s a double edge sword. Yes it’s good to have access to pain meds to keep you out of pain but it’s costing money and also it could be dangerous maybe if there pressed. 

I know many of my other friends I’ve met it affects their anxiety and daily life having to worry about having enough meds and not get sick or be in pain.  How does one cope with that? Does that lead to anyone struggling with depression or anxiety or ability to work? I struggled with being under prescribed myself for a long time and it took a toll on my body. My mind. And my life. I’m still technically not prescribed what I should be in most people’s eyes with all my conditions and injuries but it’s better than it was. At least I don’t have to go the street pharma route. 

Does anyone have a story they’d like to share. 

I would like to encourage anyone struggling with pain who is under prescribed. Don’t give up. Plz. Never give up. If you ever feel like your done and you wana give up. There’s people on reddit and drs who do care. I will even be here for someone if you need a shoulder to cry on on someone to just vent out to. I’m a very good listener and I have a ton of advice usually people say they appreciate. I try to stay positive and helpful and hopeful. I had to deal with a very rude dr for a long time who made me feel terrible about being on opiates and made me feel a way I can’t explain.  And then I read some reddit post about talking to a diff dr and how to talk to them and I found a ton of things that helped me communicate better and open up more dialogue. Honestly changing drs and speaking exactly how it is and not being dramatic and not over using words helped me relay to my dr how bad I really was struggling. 
I also keep a pain journal. I am very fascinated with opiates and thing they are an amazing thing and should be both respected and loved at the same time. They can help and they can hurt. You gotta have respect. Just some feels I have right now. I hope everyone’s having a good weekend and drop a line or something here and tell me how it is for you or your view on things. I know there is a vast array of opiate fans and opiate haters and people who have to do them or just enjoy take them people who just only use for pain. What do opiates mean to you and what does the current situation do for you.  Has the “opiate epidemic” affective you? Even my dr told me most of the opiate crisis is because drs are cutting people off, under prescribing or other things but the major issue isn’t opiates. It’s the cutting of street meds. And many drs are staring to really see that and realize hey if we just treat people like they should and not punish them for being on opiates maybe we can decrease their chances for really abusing. There’s fine line between it. And I know many friends teeter between it and I don’t judge anyone for anything because everyone has a story and a reason.

Today I'm 579 days ""sober"" after I started suboxone treatment. I don't consider myself completely sober, as I am still dependant on suboxone.

Two days before I started, I made a post here on my account (which I can't use anymore due to it being too much of a reminder). When I made the post saying I was done, that I'm tired of being sick and only using to avoid WD's and not because I enjoy it, I got the typical ""see you soon"" or ""you'll be back"" posts, but I also got a lot of support.

I asked what I could expect, I told you guys that I was scared,  and most of you believed in me. You called me down and reassured me. You helped me. And at the time, you had much more faith in me than I did.

I wanted to thank you and this community for helping me through the worst part of my life when I was using, and also when I was recovering. Your words, whether you meant it or not, really saved me, as I didn't want to live like that anymore.

I want you to know that no matter how far gone you are, or how badly you think it's too late, or how you don't believe you could ever actually quit... you can. It is never too late to quit. Ever. If you've even considered quitting, it means that your brain is already on the path of quitting. I honestly believe that if I can do it, so can you.

Sure, you will still have to live with the reason why you started in the first place, whether it's trauma, depression and anxiety, or mental illness or... Well, anything, you can get help for that.

The one in question is the Mecke test kit on dance safe. Does anyone have any experience with it? Im honestly just curious to have it around to test some of the pills I buy just because. I know the fent tests are a must have, but I think the test kit will also be a good thing to have around just because. So I guess the question I’m asking is, does anyone have any experience with it or perhaps any other test kits that are able to test for oxycodone and are also well known and do indeed do what they’re supposed to do. 

Also, is there somewhere else online that is cheaper than $2 each for good, real fent testing strips. I know you can’t put a price on saving your own life, but I’d really like it if I could get more than 10 for $20 considering that’ll be used in like three days of using. 

Lastly, I know it’s possible to get anaphylaxis from heroin and morphine. When I’ve shot morphine, I’d get “hives” around the area for a few minutes. Well today, for the first time EVER in the 2 years I’ve been IV’ing oxy, I got the same thing that happened when I shoot morphine. Has anyone ever had this happen while shooting oxy??

The question then is this: Can you administer a dose IM with an insulin rig? I have missed shots before, and most certainly these doses are more subQ than IM, and I generally don't seem to get much that way as far as onset of drug effects.

Lets say the largest size is being used, 1/2 inch needle, is it reasonable to try to reach muscle tissue with 1/2 inch needle? Obviously some areas of the body the muscle is closer to the skin.

I would love some advice, both from professional medical folks, or people who have direct experience.

Today I copped 5gs of some super fire #3 H. I also got 100x 2mg Xanax bars originaly sealed. They arent fake and only costed me 30$. Great deal. Love the UK because of  their super cheap Xanax. Never got them in a bottle before. Only got blisters. Man how I missed being high from H. Last week I ODed of some Fent analogue because that was all I could find. In my now 4 years of addiction I never ODed before since we dont got an opioid epidemic the prices for Heroin are more than great and even the street dope isnt cut with fent. So I got the fent from the onions and the vendor told me its super strong and that I really should only consume mg's of it. It was the second day I used it and it even had some real legs. But I wanted to nod and snorted about maybe 10-15mg and I still remember snorting it, pack away all my consume stuff and laid down to wait for it to kick in and being high as a kite. Then the next thing I know is waking up in the ambulance car, my ears had such a strong bellringer. That was more than crazy. I screamed super loud while talking to the guys in the car and they also screamed cause I didnt can hear them. I am so glad that I am still alive. So today I popped 2 Xanax and snorted about .3 of H amd I am feeling more than great. Also I know that after I ran out of dope I got the Xanax to help me through wds. Thats a great thing cause I know that the 5g are gone in latest a week. But this week I dont have to stress myself about dating, not sleeping and all the other stuff you have to worry and stress about while being clean. And I know this is kinda shitpost but I had to get that shit with the OD and using again off my chest. Thanks for reading guys and gals. Stay safe and happy nods.",1555538094.0

We lived this secret life together, and no matter what, he was one of the few people who knew what we were all going through.

He had been clean for a while, never had any trouble with the law, and he was training to join the military in just a few months… just as soon as his conditioning was on point. He was the most talented of all of us, and now the world is a worse place for his loss.

I went through a breakup a couple months ago and started using dilaudid heavily and doing it every day while still taking my suboxone.

Last week I had an appointment and I was completely honest with my dr about it (he’s a good guy and I’ve had to do work at his house through my job so he kind of knows me a bit better than some patients) and I expected I’d lose my take homes as per what usually would happen. 

I told him what happened and that by taking my suboxone at 7am, I can usually shoot up around 7pm and catch a fairly good buzz if I do enough, so I wanted to go on a higher dose. 

He cut my takes homes down from once every 2 weeks to 2 times a week. Gives me a higher dose. So now I have to go on saturdays and also on Wednesday. With my job, I’m not able to go until after 5pm, I normally take my dose in the morning at 7am. 

Now I’m in an even worse spot cause on Wednesday, it’s gonna be over 30 hours since my last dose, so I know the highs gonna be even better. It kind of makes no sense to me since he knows what my job entails and that I work until 5 everyday.

As he has recently sold his house and as far as I know arrangements were made to so that he could pay of other debts and get a multi-thousand dollar chunk of money. Thus, I should be able to get my money now.



Of course I didn't expect him to simply call or text, ""hey buddy, I got the money.. hit me up so I can proactively pay you back!"" I'm reluctant to initiate contact or to be receptive because he might ask for a favor that I have to awkwardly refuse. If he needed to sleep over because he's waiting for his new apartment or something.... I could get bed bugs. If I turn that down, I'm arguably a bad person.... he would say yes to letting me sleep over his house if I was out on the street, so why not the other way? Well I guess, I'm not a risk for him in terms of bed bugs... it's a one-way risk factor or unidirectional.



&nbsp;


He has shared a number of stories about his charitable exploits. Such as when a beggar asked for money and he took the guy inside the store to buy the guy some food. Unlike his alleged recent run-ins with women, the aforementioned charitable acts are believable. Also, he really likes the Avengers movies. I am courteous when he talks about it/them because I've been given many an opportunity to mention Star Trek, so I'm not gonna be a dick and be like ""these movies aren't that good"" or something. I'm actually pretty neutral but I liked Iron Man a lot. 




More importantly, last time he kindly invited me and covered the cost of a movie ticket for the last Avengers movie, he offered me fucking oxy and/or dope multiple times. He wans't forceful about it, but for a recovering junky like myself.... any offer is arguable forceful. He's doesn't know that I'm still on subs, and I'm that is a factor as to why his offers are not terribly tempting.


What if I wasn't as motivated in my recovery as I currently am. What if I was not on subs and the aforementioned lack of motivation was the case? If I wasn't on subs, would I be more likely to say ""fuck it, for old time's sake""?



Then there was that time a month or so ago when I had him over in my backyard while I did some astronomy. He was telling me about his plans when he was like ""when I move out, I plan to have a little get together.. to party. Would you be down for that?""

My answer being, sure... but then an apparent misinterpretation of his words was realized by both of us. A duality to his meaning of ""party"", in that he also meant ""party favors"" in the sense of heroine and/or oxy. This I am obviously not down for, but it wasn't obvious to him despite my many ""no, thank you"" type responses. 

Maybe that's the problem, that I don't fucking snap and make it crystal clear that I'm good. Maybe he's just an asshole. 

He went on to softly insist and was like ""it's on me... you know like you don't have to buy any.."" Oh joy, and I already had said that I've accrued so much clean-time that I wouldn't want to break my clean streak. Does he truly not understand how important that is to me or he just trying to influence me back down that road? Anyway, he was like.. ""would you at least come hang out and drink if I got a bottle of Vodka?"" 

I like vodka and cranberry but I think this is part of his grand plan. Maybe I'm getting to conspiratorial, but I believe this kind offering of vodka isn't simply so that we can have a fun party. Nosiree, I think he wants to get me drunk enough to reduce my inhibitions... to drop my shields... to stop caring so much about my clean time.


To simply say ""when in Rome, break out the dope!"" Surely he would settle for, ""ugh, fuck it... chop up the line.."" OH wait, I wouldn't have to say that.. the line would already be out and ready for me before I got to the bottom of my third cup. At least, I would bet on that.

 
Point being, this is one of the reasons I'm not quick to reach out to him or respond. **Why I haven't reached out and simply asked, ""do you have my $50?**


&nbsp;

**Basically, the reasons for me are:**


* He'll offer me drugs.


* He'll say ""the money is held up in [escroll/insert reason here] and I only get [insert smaller amount of money here which is only enough to cover basiscs + his own drugs + any drugs he intends on offering me despite my refusals to partake]


* He'll make some kind of request that will make me wish I was not having a conversation with him so that he wouldn't have been able to make said request in person.


&nbsp;


**Scenarios** - if I were to contact Cliff:


I nominate the second bullet point from right above, that he would not have m $50 for some stupid reason. Real or not, it would at least serve to explain why he hadn't proactively messaged ""I got your $50 ready and waiting for you.""


That if I'm not hanging out with him, it's impossible for him to offer me opiates and impossible for him to get me to go down that road. I consider my sobriety to be as important to me as it is to others. Even if it isn't that important to others, I want to be beacon of hope and strength of will. Something others can look to in their time of temptation. Another reason for others to pick themselves up and brush the dust off in order to resume their recovery. There are too many heavy handed, judgemental Nazis in recovery communities... or those with an ""all or nothing"" attitude who care not to acknowledge anything less as being good. Well, that's what I've heard and interpreted, I have not interacted with those types very much and when I have I usually don't enlighten them to my status. If they're happy with where they are at, I congratulate them if the topic of their recovery comes up.


So anyway, as I said.. don't wanna communicate because then he'll try to get me to hang out. If I hang out, he'll use that as a vector to offer me opiates. Sloan using short-acting opiates is not an option because failure is not an option. Deviation from my personal program is highly discouraged. I don't want to say it's not an option (although it isn't for me) because I want others to know that if they do deviate... their recovery is not over. They just gotta get back on the horse even if it hurts a bit. That if they put up with that momentary discomfort, I'll be cheering them on and will put my hand out to pull them above the field of despair.


If Cliff was getting clean, maybe me not interacting with him would be negative on his psyche. However, it's more likely anything I do to help him will simply support his ability to carry out operations as an addict in active addiction. 


Maybe he really did scale back his use, I coldn't tell because I barely hang out with him but I am well aware of his ability to tell tall tales.


&nbsp;


**tl;dr:**


Is it worth $50 for me to re-initiate communication with Cliff. This could be as simple as texting, ""can I get my $50?""


Is it worth letting him keep the $50 in order to avoid contact. If or when he does hit me up, he'll probably be inviting me to a movie or asking for a favor. If he rings my doorbell at a time I can't avoid, then I might regret not getting my money back while there was a chance? Then again, maybe he has an excuse that would prevent me from getting my money now anyway.",1555515275.0

So I think I am a low level user. I mostly hit the codeine and I have binge stints of taking anywhere from 60mg to 150mg daily.  Been doing this on and off for three years. I have never exceeded 210-240mg a day (and I was only using that much daily briefly). My regular dose is 120mg.

However since having a long break of around a month I can no longer take any more than 90mg without feeling sick.

I just finished a 60mg a day stint (stints last around 7 weeks), and have had a week or so with nothing. Also 60mg is such a small amount so it shouldnt ruin my tolerance that much right? But when I take 90mg+ or more it makes me feel so seedy! WHich is bizarre considering I could take up to 200mg + in the past

Just took 7.5 Oxy and it just doesn't get me high in a nice way either anymore. I just feel spacy and nauseous.  I dont even want to take more than this as I feel it will just make me even more sick. This never used to happen :(

Even after longer breaks its just like my body cant handle them anymore or do I just need to have a much longer break? Surely this is abnormal though. People abuse opioids at much higher levels for longer than I do.

It’s also pretty moderately easy to get an opiate treatment for chronic pain apparently, but people here legit don’t really care for it and prefer weed -it’s not like they even realize the addiction issues it comes with and that’s why they prefer weed - the general public (based on the maaaany comments I read on that post) doesn’t even understand that it’s heroin - they just think it’s another medication. IT’S THE WEIRDEST THING. It’s the most indifferent attitude to the best chemical out there. There’s no strict policies on prescriptions because abuse is either rare or nonexistent  ( after reading the post I did a whole bunch of research as laws and treatments here for different shit). I also watched a local documentary that covered drug smuggling and all substance caught was coke weed and some meth /ecstasy  - heroin didn’t even get any spotlight on the show. I get that people have different drug of choice but you’d think there would be SOME community of junkies - but if there is one here it must be extremely small or not even realize they’re junkies since they’re being given continuous supplies from legit medical sources.

So if youbget grossed out by shit, please don't keep reading.... I am doing this to genuinely help people. I dont wanna see comments ""Oh thats fuckin gross man"" ....you chose to read it. NOTE: THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WHO WANNA TREAT IT NATURALLY

So I've found some hacks for myself that may help you guys as well. I know how stressful it can be. I take Subutex everyday and I feel like it can be worse than dope or oxy as far as OIC goes. It's not all the time, but when it happens it sucks. So here's how I fix it.

1) Get a full nights sleep. This will not work if you dont get enough sleep.

2) Whatever you eat before that full nights sleep, make sure its rich in fiber. I get a nice big salad, with spring mix, spinach leaves, red onion, broccoli, some bacon and egg.
I also eat a wheat roll with butter.

3) Drink A couple glasses of water before you goto sleep, and when you wake up. Water is natures laxative, the opiates dry you up. 

4) When you wake up, after drinking a glass of water... Drink something with enough caffeine in it. I prefer Monster Lo Carb. Most people know what I'm talking about with coffee, coffee will make you shit. 

5) If you clash the sides of your hands together, and then cross arms and tap your elbows (funny bone) switching about every ten reps....this will natrually help your bowels move. Do this for about a minute or two and you'll be surprised how much it will help.

6) Also. If after that your still struggling, smoke a bowl of a weed. For some reason when I smoke , when it starts hitting me it will raise my heartbeat. Probably because it raises metabolism. 

7) Dont sit on the toilet, just squat over it. It will slide out so much easier.

8) Wait till after to dose your opiate.



Just so you know, if you haven't went for 3-4 days, your stool might be in chunks and hard, and it might hurt, but you have to get it out. What I do is just close my eyes and tell myself DO IT!! 

Again I'm just trying to help, the main key is honestly water and staying hydrated.",1555459650.0

I personally need at LEAST 30g or 29g. They used to have quite the variety. Now it's all one brand, kind of shitty lasting 31g rigs.

I'm considering going to Walgreen's or Fry's (Kroger) pharms to try & get the size rigs I want.

 I've tried CVS in the past and idk if it was the pharma cashier but she gave me the 21 questions bullshit, which I all had answers for. I look clean cut, I rarely IV so no track marks. 

I'm just broke af from medical bills, cerebral palsy specialist & 3 surgeries on my legs (2 major on my legs & ankle 1 minor on my lower leg). I'm in a lot of pain from that, even though I had the thigh high nutsack scraping casts taken off, I still have the below knees casts on. 

I'd order online (what site is the best, allegro?) but cant afford it atm with the shipping & I really dont need a box of 100.

Idk this started as a post about Walmart's new BS rigs but I'm wondering if any kind souls on this sub would mail me a bag or even a few sterile 1cc/1mL 29g or 30g ""long"" needle (12.7mm/ 1/2"") rigs

It’s all a bunch of crap.  Even some drs will admit that it’a a joke and a news/political/money thing and they don’t need to get in the way of letting drs ex and treat patients. The problem is when China got involved and shipping mass loads of fent and carfent and there was a ton of pressed pills and cut stuff and people are dying that way. If they just decriminalized opiates and cannabis and natural things like Kratom many people would be a lot safer and lives would be saved.  The act of having to rely on street pharma is what really makes it more dangerous. If we could just get access to safe meds when we need them we wouldn’t have the risk. There’s actually someone who is running in 2020 who said that’s what he wants to do is decriminalize stuff.

So its been a longg ass time since my last post. But I was bored and decided to share this simple little trick (that Dboys DONT want you to know!!!) that ive been using to conserve my H lately. Ready?

Smoke with your scale on. Thats it. Sounds stupid simple right?

If you’re at home, and you have a scale, place it on your desk/table/whatever surface that you have your dope and foil on. Turn it on and place your dope on it. Now, every time you pick up your tar and break off a piece, place the rest back on the scale. That way you see exactly how much you’re actually smoking. I know I’m personally prone to just chain-smoking until all my shit is gone, not really realizing how much I’m actually using/wasting in a given smoke sesh. Its way too easy to just keep breaking off small pieces and throwing them on the foil until suddenly all your dope is gone and you’re fucked until the next day when you can re-up.

Leaving the scale on while you smoke forces you to consider how fast you’re going through your stash, and encourages you to conserve what you have. Its especially helpful for those who (like me) can compulsively smoke through all their dope in a single evening if they’re not careful.

So yeah, I hope this helps a few smokers out there get a little more mileage out of their dope. Also, if you don’t already, use a tooter and collect your resin! You’re missing out on some good returns if you don’t.

Anyway yeah, thats all guys. Happy nods and stay safe errybody",1555408263.0

It was a 3 month chip that is suppose to block opiates and alcohol(i think alcohol, IDK) and other downer type chemicals and dissolve in your body over the three month period i guess. But mine never blocked any type of opiate or anything i got high as shit using heroin One month after getting this put in. And instead of dissolving inside me it would leak out a sulfer smelling yellow goo... Like a lot at a time. Then healed over and I was left with this like hard thing under my skin.. 

Now over six months later, it starts leaking the same gross liquid and blood as well now. But the more i squeeze out, the smaller the hard part under my skin gets. Like it never entered my system. Just sat there in me melting until irritated enough the wound re opened and started leaking the rest out of me. It's fucking annoying and gross.. I don't like it.. 

Anyone else ever have any experiences with these things? I got it put in while living in turkey. Never heard of it in the US tho. So i hope to at least let people know about this bull shit chip and highly recommend NOT to get it if given the option.

I didn’t register when i stuck the needle in so i pulled out without injecting any of the shot and a small pea sized knot formed at the hole afterwards. I pulled the tourniquet off and after a few minutes the knot went away but the area is bruised slightly and sore when i bend my arm. I wanted to know if there was anything I should do to speed up the healing process, and if there was anything i should avoid doing like not using that same vein until it heals completely.

Is there anything i should be worried about? Im a bit paranoid that there may be something wrong, but then again there are no bumps or knots and its just sore.

sometimes that can lead back down the dark path, but most times I think we can deal with the maintenance programs many of us have started on... the maintenance program i started on with subs, then m-done, then finally to Kadian has 100% saved my life since I started it about a year and a bit ago, that was literally the turning point when I stopped using fentanyl and crack, and stopped being majorly depressed and on the border of suicidal thoughts/tendencies.

Anyway here are those tips I wanted share for ANYONE who's thinking about or wanting to relapse.. or just wanting get that itch scratched temporarily because we all know it's a thirst that will never be quenched, and it's a mental disorder that will never go away, something we may most likely be fighting for the rest of our lives.

1. If you don't have any good friends you can link up with that you trust to make sure you're ok or that you trust enough to make sure you don't die in the event of an OD or some event where you're unconscious, make sure to use in a public park, or the washroom of a busy fast food restaurant or diner, that way if you OD there will be a much better chance of someone finding you and calling for paramedics, or if you're in my part of the world someone would just have naloxone on hand and be able to save you right then and there.
2. If you're in an area where Narcan has been made available OTC/non-prescription always make sure you have a stock of narcan, where I am they give out 0.4mg ampoules for free at every health center.. it usually takes 2 maaybe 3 on average of those ampoules to bring someone back, from what i've seen.
3. VERY IMPORTANT. Make sure you are NOT SITTING IN ANY AWKWARD POSITIONS. Preferrably laid flat on a bed or in a comfortable chair of some sort... This is a very serious one.. I personally know of a guy through my dad's ex wife who was clean for 4-5 years or something crazy, and one night he decided to relapse for one reason or another, maybe he did plan it out, who knows, but he clearly didn't plan well enough, because he nodded the FUCK OUT... in a really bad position apparently, because he ended up having to get BOTH of his legs amputated the day after or a couple days after. Niiice trade-off. I guess that dope he did better've had some decent legs hey? absolutely terrible joke, but you get the point.
4. If you're in a region where fentanyl and it's analogs are even remotely prevalent, which is alot of places now, smoking is the golden ticket to not dying.Take it from me, when I started out I was a snorter. I always did pretty small bumps of any drugs I ever snorted, because for one, i started out with coke first and I know from researching cocaine is ridiculously potent for what it is, I think I read that something like a pound of coca leaves produces a half gram of powder, or 1 pound equals 1 gram, something crazy.One thing to always remember is you can always take more, but you can't take less...IV'ing is the top method for ODing and dying I guarantee you.You don't know what's in your shit or how much, and once you press that plunger down there's no going back.at least when you're smoking you know the bioavailability is relatively low compared to other ROAs therefore decreasing your chance of OD and making it easier to titrate your dose up effectively. This is advice for some newer users, and some experienced users alike.
5. Lastly, don't be an idiot like I was in the beginning stages of starting doing opioids.I used to go to the studio every friday night and turn up with all my drugs and a drive full of my own beats ready to record some shit.the average friday night there consisted of a 40 or 60 oz bottle of hard liquor, usually vodka, a 0.5 to a gram of coke, and a couple quarter bags of down/''heroin'' aka fentanyl analogs since that's all thats out here now pretty much.literally most dope is colored weird colors here now, just cold copped a 0.1 of some shit that was kool-aid purple today.n when the guy was getting my shit another dude who was gonna bring me shit came back out and said he was 20 short of a reup and it wouldve been blue chunk dope. all colors of the rainbow now.BOTTOM LINE, DON'T MIX DOWNERS. NEVER MIX ALCOHOL WITH FENTANYL OR ANY OPIOIDS OR BENZOS FOR THAT MATTER, THESE GREATLY INCREASE CHANCE OF OVERDOSE.I swear the only reason I never OD'd when I was at the studio is because A) I take small bumps, and B) I was always doing coke along with the alcohol and down.

Finally, sorry for the giant post but I felt like some of this should get out there to some people on this sub.Just trying to make the world a safer place.As an addict myself, I know what were some of the factors in me NOT dying early on in life.I have a whole life ahead of me, I'm only 26, turning 27 next month.I feel old but I look WAY younger apparently. I just moved to a new neighborhood and the 80 year old neighbor next door asked me if I was going to highschool in the area... LOLAnyway I hope these tips help some people in this sub and I hope people take some of it to heart because I'm only trying to decrease the amount of people that have to die way too early in their lives. It's not worth this little drug. this drug and all the dealers selling it will be around for centuries to come, we only have one life here.

Anyway take care guys n gals & stay safe.",1555390623.0

It's so easy when chipping to talk yourself into using more frequently than you originally agree too. I found myself doing that so I decided to give myself a good 5 days in between uses now for a little while. Took my last 2mg sub dose about an hour ago and I'm gonna dose my black tar on Wednesday night",1555386748.0

This page has turned into just crap with every post just being about pills and how a 5mg percocet has people fading and OD'ing. Then you have the stupid questions of should I boof my hydrocodone and will I die if i took this 5mg percocet and drank a beer. I just feel that it is now just kids posting how cool they are for scoring some weak pills and how they are going to get blasted. Maybe all of us old time heroin users who made this sub great are either clean, dont have time for this anymore, in treatment, popped by the law, or passed away (Rest in Peace) :/ sorry, just real bitter looking at the latest posts.",1555385946.0
