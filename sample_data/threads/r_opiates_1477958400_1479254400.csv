It was crazy, normally fu-f fent has hellacious, crippling withdrawl.

With my addict brain working at full capacity, i have more fu-f fent coming but itll be a few days before its there (meaning i'll feel even more guilty cause ill be going from kicking it to starting right back over). I was planning on using the same taper plan but maybe using methadone isntead of sub strips. Does anyone have any input on using 10mg methadone pills to taper? I get mininmal/0 w/d symptoms from bupe which is a true JJ blessing. Came off an 8 month 4-8mg habbit in with 30 8mg strips after pissing hot at one sub clinic. Then kicked a month habbit recently. I dont even count using it once or twice.

Still had the taste in my mouth but not as strong. so i did what i usually do, i held the spit in my mouth for 10 min and swallowed. I was to scared i didn't get my dose tho, so i just took another 1mg strip and that went like it was suppose to.

You can also send samples for GC/MS testing and you can actually find out the purity and any adulterants. If you can afford it, you would know what you're putting into your body. Also smoking heroin has been proven to greatly lessen the chance to OD due to very quick onset. Sure...you'll be physically dependent...but you're feeling very good.

For once in my stupid idiotic life, I've gained a LITTLE tiny bit of control!!!!!..... 2 weeks ago I made the realization that I was causing the love of my life to begin to go into debt trying to keep a roof over our heads. I was not holding up my part of rent, bills, anything. He was super upset about it, but he didn't want to confront me about it. Now, I don't make very much money. But I make enough that I should be able to cover my $700 of rent plus my car insurance and then some. However, due to my habit, and the monstrous tolerance I've developed, I was, of course, spending all my cash on dope. And I'm talking ALL my cash. Nearly a brick a day if I had the funds for it...

So, I made a decision. I knew if I tried to quit, I would not succeed. Unfortunately for me, I've only recently discovered the bliss of IV. And I'm at the point where I no longer miss or have to ask you guys dumbass questions, I know my sweet spots. And I finally found my perfect dose, etc. so quitting right now was not realistic. Nope. So I had to do something else.
I set an alarm in my phone titled ""You made it, have your cookie."" This alarm goes off 3 times a day. 10:30 AM (a little after my normal time to wake up). 4:30 PM. And finally, 11:00 PM. Those are the only 3 times I am allowed to use a day. And I get to do 5 bags per shot. Never 6, but also never 4.

I've successfully kept up with this schedule now, and as much as I am really kind of missing the fat 8 bag shots, or the ""Fuck I just opened a stressful email. Let me do one shot to calm down"", I am actually surprised in myself and ... Okay, fine... I'm proud of myself. I know. I'm an addict who is in active abuse. I don't have much to be proud of. But seeing that I actually have the willpower to go through with this, knowing I can get by with a bun and a half a day instead of 3-4-5 buns a day, it's showing me some new things about myself. Now I'm starting to think maybe I can cut this down to 2 times a day. Now I'm starting to think hey, maybe I can actually quit. And soon. Maybe I'm not as much of a powerless, worthless, loser as I think I am. Maybe I can turn this into the biggest, most positive change I'll ever make-- which is actually stopping for good.

So I just wanted to stop by and say this. Cuz I don't have anybody else I can talk to about this stuff. And I wanted to share with you guys that if I can do it, I think anybody can. I have always been the type of chick who doesn't know what self control is. But if I'm holding myself down while my mind is SCREAMING at me to go bang 8 bags and lay in bed all day, then I think maybe I can eventually hold myself down and stop this addiction once and for all. 
We shall see.

5ago2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5ago2r/dreamwish_of_cosmic_justness/,0,https://redd.it/5ago2r,isprinkles,dreamwish of cosmic justness,"Last year, I got chronically sick and around this time (October) had surgery, ended-up in a weird spot between medicine and the law, and it was traumatizing, to put it simply. I had no support system and the stigma of contagious disease made it difficult to reach out to anyone. I had a boyfriend of 6 years who seemed to me like he had just tuned-out and shut-down. I mean he was there when I was in the hospital, but after I was kind of on my own, and it turned-out to be a 9 month long treatment after the surgery. Not to mention I lost the job I had, and was jobless for a month or so AFTER the quarantine, which was after the surgery, which was 2 weeks long.

Anyway, my perspective became a little skewed, and honestly kinda nihilistic. I used to use heroin 6 years prior, before I got with my (now ex) boyfriend, got clean, and I spent those 6 years building a future with him, working towards some stupid dream of upward class mobility or something. And it didn’t matter, because all it took was some weird shit living in my fallible human body to come fuck it all up. At this point, which was March of this year, I wanted to die. I started fucking with heroin again a month before the surgery when the lovely medical team nonchalantly used the word “cancer” when scheduling my surgery the following month. I wasn’t in too deep then, but the law aspect of being ill really fucked with me. You could say I have a problem with authority.

The first person I had picked-up from before the surgery I met through….a certain sub-forum of a very popular website. His stuff was ridiculously expensive and not that good, but he introduced me to my now best friend J who I am actually living with now. I drove her home so she could sell me some rigs, and she told me that she was done dealing with this guy (let’s call him B), to stay away from B, that he was a rip-off, a scumbag; I was enthralled from the moment I laid eyes on him. But I followed her advice, and we picked-up from other people in the area, for a few months, until March 2016. My new best friend J wouldn’t talk to me for over a week because I criticized her ability to be on time and find her stuff (keys, phone, etc), she took it incredibly personally, and remember, I’m going through some shit too, boyfriend is tuned-out, I’m walking a very thin line between “chipping” and full-on-don’t-care-what-happens mode. I had no one to talk to, so I called B one day and we started talking, in a somewhat romantic way. I met up with him one day when I was off and picked him up from work, and after a mostly platonic evening, took him to his place, and came in when I decided I was too fucked-up to be driving. Well, I spent the night there, and went straight to work the next day.

B told me to tell my then boyfriend L I’m leaving him, and that I will come live with B at his place. I went home during lunch that day to get some things, thinking L wouldn’t be home, but he was. I told him everything that had happened, and he demanded that I never speak to B again. I blew up at L, about how much he cared now was too little, too late. I got my things, and went back to work, and went to B’s after work.

I never asked, but B just gave me drugs. He middled a lot, every single day in those days, and he just always gave me stuff. He charged three times as much, usually. For the beginning of our relationship, because what he was getting me now was stronger than anything I had ever done, I was passed-out. A lot. We had absurd amounts of sex while high, like several times a day. He touched me exactly the way I wanted to be touched, kissed me how I wanted to be kissed, fucked me how I wanted to be fucked. I was still fascinated with him, more than ever. He was a character, he was exactly who I wanted him to be, down to every last detail. I knew I would experience pain with him, but he was somewhat nihilistic as well, and better him than L. L would call 911 if I was too high; B would just throw water on me til I woke up, or let it be and take photos and show me later.

So B had a pretty good job when I met him. As did I, however it was one county over as B was one county north of where I originally lived with L. So I drove my car about 2 hours roundtrip everyday to get to work, and dropped B off and picked him up. Before he used to take Ubers to and from work. I began coming pretty late to work, but I always got everything done, and done well, so nobody really cared. I was really depressed one week and didn’t come to work, but I was allowed to return because they really did like me and need me there. At this point, I started to really, seriously consider suicide, like really thinking about it more in-depth than ever, the logistics of it, the possibilities. I learned within two weeks of dating B that when I went to sleep, he could not sleep and did not, and stayed awake for days and days.

I began to see a lot of red flags with B. One day, I drove to my old house and saw L (nothing romantic at all, L wouldn’t have anything to do with me like that ever again, it seemed like), and when I told him, he sat me down and just berated me for probably an hour while standing over me, and he was just excellent at using just the right words to make me feel so small. It was scary. Another time, I wished to leave the room after he was done talking, and he obstructed me to the point of holding me in place, until I yelled at him to let me go. We lived with other people at the time, so he did, and while he didn’t actually hurt me, I do not like to be cornered.

Other than that, we had a pretty wild time together, with lots of sex and drugs. He still middled for people, especially at work, and eventually lost his job probably due to this, and the lack of sleep. Very soon after, I stopped working at my job, that was too far, too difficult to do in my state, and the idea of having to support us under these conditions...I just thought it better to stop. He had always promised he would take care of both of us. I don’t know why I believed him. He had one customer that easily paid our rent for about two months. After that, we had zero savings: One weekend, while still working, he spent his entire paycheck in under two days. For being Jewish, he was awful with money.

The worst of B came out when he took Xanax. He turned into what equaled a violent drunk, just worse. I would go to sleep, and he would eat all the Xanax he had, call his dealers at all hours of the night and spend all of his money, and do it all. The first time he did this, I went to work in the morning. I’d find him outside just sort of grunting frustratedly like he wanted to sleep but couldn’t, throwing patio chairs over. I left for work, and I guess when he came to, he called me at work and accused me of taking his money and all of his dope. He was very very convinced and very pissed off, until I guess he found something or pieced together text messages or phone calls on his phone, and figured out that he blacked-out, and apologized when I got home. Another time, he just got in my face and backed me into a corner, out on the front porch, and wouldn’t let me back into the house, until I swallowed my pride and strategically told him how much I loved him, etc etc which was not what I would usually say during an argument like that, but I was scared and I wanted to go inside and I wanted it over. 

He did this a few more times, and the first time I left him was one such time. He was being a belligerent jerk, on Xanax of course, and I left to get in my car. He tried to keep me from leaving, and said we should just go have a cigarette and talk. I said OK, and as we’re walking, he lit himself a cigarette, and made me beg for one even though he offered, and added a, “That’s right, they’re my cigarettes” or some shitty thing like that. B liked to rub it in my face that he provided this or that for me. I ripped the cigarette in half and threw it at him, and started to walk towards my car. He started kicking my feet from under me and behind as if he were trying to trip me. It was the most absurd thing. He stood in my way when I got to my car. I shoved him out of the way and he broke my side view mirror right off (and later when sober, he asked what happened to it.) I got in my car, and he tried to hold my door open and in place so I couldn’t drive away, but that didn’t really work and I drove away. I called the non-emergency police number for our area so that I could come get my stuff, and told B I would be by with a cop. He of course started throwing my stuff outside, and putting like empty baggies and rigs out. The cop really didn’t care, although they did get nice and chummy, B was always such a social butterfly. I packed all my shit and went to a nearby Walgreens to figure out what I’d do. B contacted me shortly after and said he was sorry and now sober what with the cop coming by and all.

I think I forgave him and even came back, though embarrassed for the landlord and roommates to see me after the big to-do I made about leaving, parked farther and made sure to not be seen. We spent a few days like this, until one day that B went with our best customer to write up a business plan, all day, while I was at home, laying in bed depressed. At some point we spoke on the phone, and B was just a huge dick about my depression, saying he was depressed too, and some people in the world don’t have the luxury of staying in bed depressed. Like I don’t already know that stuff and beat myself up over stuff like that, anyone who is depressed knows that is the most counterproductive thing to point out. I already feel like shit, I’m not enjoying myself, laying around all day. He was in an Uber supposedly getting lunch with this other asshole, but they were most likely buying drugs. Either way, I was completely offended with how he chose to speak to me, himself being “depressed” and all, and with other people around, like it was no big deal.

Later that night, he was just....he just still had this self-righteous sort of sadistic attitude towards me. He gave me less stuff, and it was the first time he ever really messed with how much he gave me or said no when I asked. He used to say he would never say no, to just ask. We went to sleep, and he sold the last of his stuff to someone who came in the middle of the night. I was pissed that he would have nothing for me in the morning. He offered to call someone and pick up more, but I was fed-up and I left. I could foresee that he would begin to toy with the amount of drugs he gave me, and I decided I would withdraw and be done with the games. I went to J’s house. He assumed, and still did forever after that, that I was upset about the amount of drugs he gave me and that he didn’t have more.

I told J the plan, that I would kick and leave his stinky ass (She did really always complain that he was smelly, and he was, and she said I smelled like him. She even warned me lol.) Anyway, first night I was there, sick, I was finally asleep, and J, being a drug addict as well as a drunk, woke me from my precious sleep while she was drunk and asked me to drive her to our dealer’s place to get some hard. I said okay, how could I refuse? We smoked some hard while I was deep in withdrawals, which was actually okay, although I threw up.

J would be super sweet at night while drunk/high, and a completely different person when she awoke. She seemed to dislike me even for being there. B needed to collect the last of his stuff, as he hadn’t paid rent for that month, and would be moving in with his best customer/business partner/whatever the fuck, let’s call him D. I took him to get his stuff, and he broke me off some dope. I continued to see him intermittently while staying at J’s. He’d give me a little bit of stuff here and there. Long story short, that detox did not take. J got upset at me one morning, and said I was using her, and kicked me out. I got back with B that day when D invited me to stay with him too upon hearing I had nowhere to go. So B and I lived with D for a little while. When B and I got into arguments, I guess my shrill womanly yelling at B got to D, and he’d kick me out of his place. I slept in my car at the CVS and Publix by his apartment for a lot of nights, while B stayed with him in his place, slept on a bed, with A/C. When D needed someone to shoot him up because he had the least steadiest hands, I would be allowed up and even be allowed to sleep there if he was on a binge or doing Xanax as well and just plain passing out everyday.

One time, we were all supposed to “get clean”. D had to move back up north in about a month, and B and I were not doing that well financially, especially if D was getting clean, so I thought we were all in it together. Not B though, he’d pretend to be getting clean, except since I actually was, he was just getting double-high. I guess he thought we wouldn’t notice him full on nodding, drooling. I of course pointed it out, and gave him shit, and he never really admitted any wrongdoing, but he did keep giving me dope after that.

D had a habit of kicking us both out at the drop of a hat. Sometimes he’d just kick us out within minutes of us leaving the apartment with plans of being back within an hour or so, not letting us return to get our things even. He was the opposite of J in that he'd wake up super chipper, and then sundown into a completely different person. One night this happened when I got way too high off some stuff that normally wasn’t very fire, and I got stupid black-out high and like facetiously said goodnight to D on my way out the door, then fought with B to go down the stairs (I wouldn’t go down the stairs, and I kept yelling at him to not touch me. I have no recollection of this). After a few days at a weekly rate hotel, then we’d be invited back one night when D wanted to be shot-up by yours truly. D invited us back to stay for a few days.

At some point, shit got pretty crazy when J’s dealer called us telling us she had some really fire stuff. She really did, it knocked B out, for whom nothing could ever touch his tolerance, really. We had a couple of crazy nights at D’s with that stuff, until one morning I awoke to B, on Xanax again, who said we needed to pack everything up and go. So we did, sidestepping D’s blissfully barred-out and doped-up body in the doorway of the bedroom. We took our stuff and some of his, including some shampoo B packed away that D swears to this day I stole. We packed everything up in my car, that at this point needed to be pushed and the clutch popped to get started each and every time. For a few more nights, I stayed in the car with all of this shit in it, so packed to the point that I couldn’t even lean the seat back and had to lay over the E-brake and onto the passenger side seat to sleep (I’d take off the e-brake and put it in 1st, but still, it was way fucking uncomfortable). It was more miserable than usual. B could sleep at D’s though, and he did because there was really no reason to pack everything up and leave, it just made Xanax sense to B at the time. I don’t really understand.

Another night, he left to go pick up for someone named Jimmy, when in actuality he went right across the hall to the neighbor lady’s apartment. This was a lie he thought fit to tell while on, you guessed it, Xanax. I didn’t understand why. I begged him before he went to go see ‘Jimmy’ to be home as soon as possible. I woke up at 4am and he was not back, but he was “right outside” when I called him because he was right across the hall, smoking hard with the neighbor. I was pissed. He still doesn’t even recall that evening. (I brought it up weeks later, and he said, “Who’s Jimmy?”) He came to the door, and then said “wait, brb”. I listened to the door across the hall and heard his stupid voice through it, and opened it, and yelled at him. They hushed me because her daughter was asleep, I really couldn’t give a flying fuck at this point. He came back in D’s apartment, and woke him, which was a big no-no. The next day D said he was starting to realize that there was a reason I was loud, and it was in response to B.

But that didn’t matter. Eventually, D kicked us out for good. It might have had to do with the whole thing with the neighbor as well. B and I stayed at motels nearby. He had a few customers left that could pay our motels for a night or two. At this point, he didn’t have nearly as many customers as when we had started dating. Things were getting pretty bleak. Eventually, everyone got clean, or they got burned by B, or burned B even, though rare. If we had nowhere to go, we’d stay up all night in the car since we couldn’t recline and sleep. One day, we decided we wanted to jump off a bridge, so B knew of just the right bridge, and he fell asleep while I was trying to drive to it. I awoke him when we got to the main road we needed to be on to make sure I’d turn the right way, and he said something and I turned left. Eventually I was lost, and woke him up again, and bitched at him because he was supposed to be getting us there. He called me a dumb cunt, as he was wont to do, ripped out my car visor and beat me with it a few times, screamed in my ear, and I told him to leave the car. I left, the passenger side door would not close for a few days now either, and we devised a tie to keep it mostly in place, but it would still swing open when I’d turn left. I abandoned him somewhere, and then was soon full of regret, for in my sorry state I’d prefer to be with him than alone, somehow. I went to a Kinkos for WiFi to use my now-defunct iPhone to text him through Google Voice. I kept sending text after text, with no response. The car was still running outside since without him I couldn’t even start the car. I got back into the car, defeated, sent one more text as I was still on WiFi, and heard his text alert: His phone was under the passenger side seat. At this point, he soon reached a restaurant and called his own phone, and I agreed to bring him his phone. Upon meeting him, he sobbed and kissed me, and we made-up. We never got to the bridge that night, but that didn’t stop him from telling everyone that he needed sympathy from that night that he stood atop a bridge just a few hours earlier...

One night, J came to our Motel 6, and we sort of rekindled some friendship. She offered us both to stay at her place, which was a huge feat because she hated B. I can’t believe she’d convinced her husband to let him stay, but it was mostly just to help me, but also because B would be paying her in dope (it was either money or dope, and she chose dope. Okay). During this week we stayed there, there was a hurricane. The day of the hurricane, we got into a fight in the driveway, in broad daylight. He obstructed me again, I tried to push him out of the way and hit his left hand that he broke one day when he was sick, punching the ceiling of my car. He grabbed me in a chokehold, and the neighbor across the street and her children saw what he did. She told her children to go inside, and yelled at him, “Hey!” He lifted me up and threw me on the ground. We were on our way to go pick up, so I got up and we still did the whole push the car, pop the clutch thing, but the entire drive I sobbed and had a skinned knee and dirt all over me. He was sorry and beside himself for having done something like that. He choked me. I couldn’t breathe. I just wished he had finished the job.

Later that day, right before the hurricane, I took a little bit of his stuff. He was furious, and it devolved into a petty fight where I held about $90 of his. J came to mediate. B revealed to her that one day after selling a good chunk of my things we had more drugs than she thought, and we didn’t give her enough, although I gave her one, and B could have easily given her one as well, but didn’t. She said that B’s tactics to turn her against me wouldn’t work, but when I was alone with her, the first thing she brought up was the drugs. Forget the choking incident earlier, which I compared what I did to that for perspective, and even suggested that B and me call it even. J was mad about the drugs she didn’t get, and B had this look of fury in his eyes when I told him myself that I had taken a little from his stuff. Then at some point B said he had some molly for J and it was over, she was completely tuned-out to the entire matter and focused on getting her shot of molly. I made B beg for forgiveness amidst the threat of calling the police. The hurricane at this point was in full-force, and J’s request to find him alternate shelter prompted me to suggest we call the police and find him shelter that way, as we had witnesses to his 3rd degree felony-level dating violence. He begged to placate me but he did not mean it, and he said he’d forgiven what I’d done but the way he referred to the incident said he did not truly forgive, but simply said the words. Eventually, the fight was over and I went to bed. J shot the molly, and I went to sleep as the hurricane rained over us.

The next morning, her husband asked us to leave. B somehow convinced J that we weren’t given an exact date so we could have one more night. But by the next night, we did leave, in my car to take B to a job on the county border, a bit far. My car died on the way there. My dad helped me tow the car to his house, and he drove us back to J’s, and he left fortunately before we had to start walking away, since we weren’t welcome there anymore. Now without a car, we took a bag of clothes and a blanket, and two pillows, put them in a shopping cart and started up north on the main road. We found a spot that seemed nice to lay down, but it was already inhabited by other vagrants. It was the weekend, and we found an injury law firm that would definitely not be open Sunday, and laid down in front of it to finally sleep. B had a nightmare, and night paralysis that night, both from which I woke him and assured him that I was awake the entire time, and that no one was there standing over us.

The next night, we had decided to end it. I was definitely for suicide at this point. We had a decent day with his middling and we had a bit of stuff, we got pretty high and I had found some Xanax the night before. We were going to get really high and end it, but we ended-up sleeping in our dealer’s car that night. He had driven us to the beach, and then to his apartment complex parking lot and I woke-up in the driver’s seat. B was really high on Xanax, it was apparent. The bit of dope I had saved for the morning was gone. So I got a pair of scissors and I got to hacking at my left wrist. It didn’t hurt, but I didn’t want to get blood everywhere so I let it drip out the driver side door. Apparently, this alarmed someone on their way to work that morning, and shortly after beginning I was hauled out of the car by the paramedics or cops, put on a stretcher, taken to a hospital, and got myself Baker Acted by the police.

I spent a week in a mental institution until they decided I was fit to leave, which they did, because I told them everything they wanted to hear. I told them that I was a cutter, and since the cuts were superficial since I didn’t have a lot of time to get anywhere with it, they believed it and thought that was A-OK. I made a friend there too. She was in the same industry as I was, and was in there for crazy alcoholism. She had a BAC of .386 when she turned herself into the hospital. I started on Prozac there, but have since not been able to refill the prescription due to some technical difficulties. I kicked there, and it really wasn’t that bad. It was an ideal situation in which to detox. I kept in contact with B while I was in there. I didn’t tell them about the abuse or about the drugs or anything like that, for fear that he wouldn’t be allowed to visit or call me. I called L in there, and my dad. B came to visit me the last day I was in there. He was really fucking high, like embarrassingly so. I told him to wake the fuck up, and he tried to deny it. I get angry just thinking about it. He would tell me over the phone that maybe it’s time for us to make sacrifices, get clean and work on things so we’re not literally homeless. I was, once again, down with getting sober, and instead he was just getting double-high. He was staying with his grandparents, who he said want nothing to do with me because they think I tried to kill him, according to him. Who knows what pitiful story he told them so they could let him stay there. They certainly didn’t want him there before.

I was able to leave when I convinced J to tell the clinic I had a place to go with her, whether it was true or not, for I had to leave that place immediately. That wasn’t easy. She had just read the letter I had sent her husband through Google Hangouts detailing how she was accepting drugs as payment for us staying there when we had offered money to give to him instead, and that when she found out we weren’t giving her enough, it was just too “stressful” to have us there, and we’d have to leave, or she may have even told him that she had just found out we were doing drugs and that was why we had to leave. I just couldn’t stand the bullshit, and being blamed for everything; in that instance, I was, once again, down with getting clean there while we had a roof and food and A/C, but you know how that goes. I basically talked her through the entire chain of events that led to me even being with this fuckface, which kind of started when she couldn’t be there for me, and maybe I couldn’t be there for her either, that we were both too fucked to be of any good to each other. Eventually she agreed to tell the clinic okay, which was great because I couldn’t take it anymore, even though it wasn’t a bad place or anything, but again, the coercive nature of it was fucking with me. I was forced to stay the entire weekend as well because they don’t discharge on the weekends. I was with my new friend T, so I wasn’t having the worst time. I left the following Monday, making it almost a full week I was in there. Not much had been resolved for me internally, but I felt ready, and vowed to never set foot in that place again.

I was able to stay with my mom for a night or two. She lives way down south, in a room in a shared house, with no A/C. I was not allowed to be there either, and her roommates were not happy about it and told the landlord. I would take the train to see B every couple of days, some days even staying up there (now 2 counties away), once with him, twice without him and just sitting around in front of Walmart, or driving around with a friend. I’d use dope intermittently, and honestly I was quite lost. He was starting to dodge me and lie to me about the stupidest shit. I caught him in several lies, until he supposedly broke down in front of his grandparents and told them about the dope, and the physical abuse, and he had this epiphany where he suddenly remembered memories he had compartmentalized or something. Whatever. He came to where I was (close but not close enough for his prissy ass to walk, though I’d walk miles to be closer to him during these days) one night and said he’d be going to rehab soon, and that he was going to kick and give his dealer to his bud that drove him, and that we could never see each other again or some shit. I left and sobbed at a bus stop for an hour, a stranger asked if I was okay. I had never felt pain like that: It was the culmination of all my shitty decisions. The realization that I took one problem and made it at least three times worse. My bank accounts were overdrawn, I ran my car to the ground, I fucked up my best job ever, my best relationship with L, I don’t know if I have any more diseases than when I started and they could mean comorbidities. I turned my external world into a replica of my internal one. It was part of the reason I loved B, he was at least down with the destruction. I don’t think he really wanted to die, though. I was supposed to do him first, that was our agreement. But I couldn’t bring myself to murder him. I don’t think he wanted to die, though.

Days and days where I did everything I could to be near him because I didn’t know what else to do, like a sad puppy, and he makes a fool of me, time and time again. I bring up the choking incident when he is extra shitty and his lying gets pretty sloppy, and even throw in some extra felonies I have on him, just to get a reaction. I’m just hurting now trying to get him to care, and at the same time, hungry for revenge if it turns out he never cared and continues to make a fool of me. I’m still pretty lost and talk to him everyday, but it hurts less and less, and I get by better and better everyday without him. I talk to L and hang out with him now sometimes too. Living with J is hard, because she still wants to get high and her husband wants me to help her stop. I don’t know how I will do that, but I will get a job again, and try my best. It’s all I can do. I reckon I’m not allowed to die, or I’d have to try harder, but J and her husband are really giving me a good shot at life again so I may as well try. I’m not sick and I’m still whole, mostly. The scars will fade, with time. I mostly miss my cats, who live with L, and I want to see them again. One was sick and I was afraid I’d never see him again. Getting rid of the physical dependence of using was a sizable part of the problem. Now that it’s gone, I am sort of...free? I was free before too, and I entered this life out of my own free will. Who knows? If sickness were all it took to cure junkies, well then we’d all be sober.",1477966648.0

Now I want to say first and foremost that I am **NOT** a doctor, certain things that I will mention worked for *me*, and may not work for everyone; as every person reacts differently to different drugs/medication. Anyways, when I first started this regime 6 months ago it was the easiest detox I had ever had gone through. I had a medium tolerance (I'd say about smoking a dub of BTH or 60-75mg of Oxy was needed to get me pretty lit, everyday use for awhile as well) when I did this detox. Just for comparison purposes of your own tolerances. 

The following is what I used:

-Valium (or Klonopin / Xanax) For: Anxiety, Muscle relaxant, Appetite

-Gabapentin (Neurontin) For: Restless Leg/Arm Syndrome, Muscle relaxant *highly recommend, was a godsend for me personally

-Clonidine (Low blood pressure med*) For: Cold sweats, Regulating body tempature

-Seroquel (or Ambien) For: Insomnia *Now Seroquel can interact with a lot of different medications, talk to a doctor. I do not recommend long term use of seroquel, just to get through the worst of your witdrawals.  (I only used it for 2 weeks, as it was the only thing that could knock me the fuck out)

-Modafinil (or Adderall/Ritain) For: Energy and general motivation, combats lethargic states *I highly recommend everyone check out Modafinil by the way. Its a non-amphetamine and give me amazing motivation, concentration, and energy without the jitteryness or come down that amphetamine based pills have. **This drug does NOT interact well with Seroquel however, it actually gave me a seizure, so yeah, don't combine the two.

-Loperamide For: diarrhea

-Marijuana For: Anxiety, Muscle cramps / spasms, Insomnia, Mood elevator, Cold sweats, Appetite 

Now all of the above is a great combo for cold turkey. I know its a lot, and some is OTC, some from doctors, and even some from the black market like marijuana; but look at what symptoms are the worse for you and check out the related meds I recommended. 

If you want to not go full turkey, and go down slowly like I did, I recommend either Kratom or Poppy Seed Tea. I used Kratom for 2-3 weeks slowly stepping down my intake each day until zero, midway though I started the above cold turkey meds. Poppy seed tea is addicting in its own way, but with users with moderate to heavy heroin or oxycodone use, it's not going to get them high without using 2-3 pounds of seeds at once.  For PST detox I recommend a 4-5 lb bag of good seeds for a detox period of no more than 3 weeks. Space it out, use 1.5 cups of seeds twice a day, then work your way down. 

I'm the biggest pussy with withdrawal symptoms guys, they literally used drive me fucking insane; I can honestly say that if I can do it, you can. Anyways guys I'd love to hear your suggestions for detox withdrawal symptoms, any meds I may have missed, or how you got through your detox period. Just wrote this on a whim to help out some brothers/sisters in need of advice. Talk to your doctors and look at the various drug regulations in your countries.

I can see why they'd be more desirable than Suboxone just because they don't have Naltrexone in them but I'm not sure if that would necessarily change the price dramatically.

I tried looking it up online and couldn't really find any helpful information so basically any input would be greatly appreciated.

I almost always refrain from correcting spelling/grammatical mistakes because it really seems dickish, pretentious, and pompous.  When I see replies that do nothing besides point out mistakes, invariably someone will eventually come along and call that person a Grammer Nazi.  

Naturally, this led me to thinking about the term Grammar Nazi and why I think it is an inappropriate term - not because it is offensive or insensitive or anything like that.  It's just inaccurate.

Genocide at the hands of the Nazis is one of the most atrocious and deplorable set of actions in the history of mankind.  But the Nazi Nazi did things very differently than the Grammar Nazi.  The WWII Nazi Nazi killed those that bothered him.  He didn't seek to correct what he viewed as deviant behavior or beliefs.  He didn't allow the homosexual the opportunity to ""change"" into a heterosexual. (ignoring that sexuality is not a choice).  He didn't allow the Jew to convert to Christianity.  He killed them, millions of them.  Nazi Nazis deserve death with hell to follow (if hell exists).  Grammar Nazis need to be replaced.

What we refer to as a Grammar Nazi is someone who replies to a post, informing the poster and all readers of what the grammatical mistake was, and the correct way to turn the phrase.  Common examples of this are your/you're, there/their/they're, should/could/would have/of.  Near and dear to our hearts are withdraw/withdraws/withdrawl/withdrawal.  

Of course we see this with drugs too - Perc30, 500mg Vicodin, China White, and pharmacokinetics (bioavailability arguments for different ROAs, ignoring other important variables like cMax, tMax, AUC).

But we don't delete somebody else's post when we see a mistake.  We don't banish them from the sub.  Instead, we (at least some of us) attempt to correct them; we point out how much better we write English, how intelligent we are, how advanced our reading comprehension and writing skills are, how we can teach these ignorant fools, so they don't make the same silly mistakes in the future.  We don't end their career as posters; we show them the light.

We are the Grammar Mormons/Grammar Missionaries.  We know better and we want you to join our ranks.  Amongst ourselves we want to discuss how much we know that you do not.  We feel sorry for you.  We pity the fool.  

We are Altruists.  We are philanthropic.  Quite frankly, we are also understaffed.  Therefore, we want to impart knowledge and wisdom.  We want to make you as superior as we are.  And then we want you to seek out the poor souls in order for you to do the same.  

Their over they're hitting the wrong keys on there keyboards.  Don't look back on these posts and think of what you could of and should of done to make this situation better.  Don't be late, don't tempt fate, don't player hate, initiate and then berate, then rehabilitate, then congregate, then procreate, and then dominate.  

Kill the Grammar Nazi.  Allow the new era of the Grammar Mormon/Grammar Missionary to begin NOW!!!",1477948911.0

And my experience with this along with a theory...,"Really struggled with putting together a concise title for this one...

I believe the only reason I developed an addiction is by doing them enough to develop a tolerance. Even now, I prefer a smaller dose than most. When I do more than my preferred dose, I honestly do not enjoy it. I think that I didn't like it very much when I had tried it over the years because I took higher doses. 


Think about it... what would you suggest a person new to oxy and/or heroin take? Probably one 30mg pill or one bag- at least that is my experience and what I have seen. To this day, I don’t like doing a whole 30mg oxy or bag at once. I just enjoy lower doses. During most of my time in active addiction, I was doing probably an average of 120mg of oxy every day, and rarely did more than 15mg at a time. It did eventually start feeling like not enough, but it took quite some time to get to that point. So, when I took 40mg of oxy my first time ever doing it, I strongly disliked the feeling. When I did 1.5 bags of heroin for the first time, I hated it. I tried it again because I was so confused how I could hate this “wonder drug”, and that time I didn’t hate it… but I didn’t like it. I could see myself doing it if it was around and offered to me, but I couldn’t see myself seeking it out and certainly never developing an addiction to it.


It took about 5 years from the first time I took an oxy to the first time I started doing it regularly/developing an addiction, with very occasional opiate use in between (example- 2 years passed between my second and third times doing dope). I did other drugs but never felt that I had an issue with those, and considered myself an “upper” person.


I became close with someone selling oxy and was around it all the time. There were always people doing it when I was around, and it was often offered for free, so I started doing it more frequently. I didn't love it, but I didn’t hate it- still not something I felt I would do if it wasn’t in front of my face. By doing this, I started building up a tolerance. And then the same dose I was taking went from being ""meh"" to being awesome. I’m sure most of you can fill in the rest of that story…


So, my theory is that a large percentage of the people who have tried opiates once or twice and then never again, or use very occasionally for a long time without developing an addiction, are like me in that.  If I never found myself in the position to develop that tolerance, I can’t see how I would have ever enjoyed opiates enough to get hooked. I don’t think I would have ever thought to do a smaller dose because it didn’t feel like “too much”- it just wasn’t as enjoyable as I anticipated- if anything, I would want to take more based on that feeling, which I did do and enjoyed it even less when I did.


I don’t quite buy into the idea that some people are simply predisposed to drug addiction in general and others are not- drug use but addiction runs deeper. I’m not saying that nobody has ever/can never do an opiate, absolutely love it and still not get addicted (for those, I think for most the line is physical dependence- if that can be avoided, it’s much easier to control), but I think that most people who do it and don’t quite see the appeal, or even hate it, just react differently to the drug and haven’t hit their “sweet spot” dose. I think it’s unlikely that anyone could actually dislike it simply due to the nature of the drug- it’s more a matter of dosage.


Just wanted to share and see if anyone has any thoughts or opinions on that theory. Feel free to dispute and make me look like a fool, it’s not as though I’ve conducted extensive research and experiences, so I am certainly not claiming to know what the fuck I’m talking about… I’m also interested to see how many of you have had a similar experience to mine and/or only enjoy opiates at relatively low doses. 


TL;DR- It took me 5 years of occasional use to become addicted to opiates. I did not enjoy the feeling enough to do it at any other time than when it was in front of my face and offered to me. I think this is because I only enjoy opiates in lower doses than what is considered normal, so I only started enjoying them once I developed a tolerance. My theory is that many of the people who try opiates and don’t care for them and either never do them again or only do them very occasionally react similarly to me and a tolerance build up or lower dose could make a huge difference in addiction potential. Curious to see other thoughts and opinions on this, as well as facts if I don’t know what the fuck I’m talking about. Also curious to see how many people also only enjoy low doses.

Tomorrow is an medical round of the rehabilitation center in germany where I am since 5 days. My backsurgery is 7 weeks ago and I still got bad pain. Three weeks after the surgery (double disc prolapses with paralyzed leg) the doctor in the hospital changed my medication to the following:

Hydromorphon 4mg = 0 - 1 - 0 - 1

Hydromorphon 8mg = 1 - 0 - 1 - 0

So all over 24mg, on bad days I take until 32-40mg over 24h.

Now I wanna change to oxycodon and want to kick it off and take it only when it's the worst pain and maybe take it sometime recreational. But how can I get the doctor to that? And what would be an good argument?

Get home throw it on the foil, it's way too white and fluffin up when I break it down. Guy gave me coke instead of dope. Smoked it now I can't go to sleep. Shit was so sketchy though. I hope I don't have to do that shit again...

5anghv,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5anghv/dboy_allstars/,20,https://redd.it/5anghv,deeeeeeeeeeeeez,D-boy All-Stars,"In the brick city I get bundles for $40 and that is the price for 1,2,3,4 or 5 from my current #1 dude. I've never gotten more than a brick so idk if I would get a price break for more than 5 but unless I was scooping for someone else too I would never buy more than 5 anyway. Usually I get 2-4 bundles which is more than enough to last me a week based on my current habit. If i get two than i get high for a couple days and clean up for the rest of the week. If i get 3 or 4 i stay high all week. Since I started running again after a Few months clean over the summer my ability to ration my stash has been amazing. Self control is something I've been seriously practicing of recent and when successful it's amazing.

My main D-boy is truly an all-star. When I relapsed in september I was waiting on the block for my old dude and my current dude pulled up next to me and gave me a free bundle and his number. That was the last time I ever went through my old dude, been calling my new guy ever since. His all-star stats include:

•hooking up variety packs (multiple stamps per bundle when order is 1 or 2 bundles and variety of bundles when order is 3+). I think he does this to evenly distribute his stash.

•always throwing in extra bags (one extra per bundle typically ... so 2 bundles = 22 bags, 4 bundles= 44 bags). After he takes the cash and gives me the bunnys I don't even have to ask he always says some shit like ""here try these too"" or ""keep sending your friends my way"" or ""you're a good dude, man. Take these too"". Lmao for real every time.

•Consistent quality. Every stamp has always been at the least a 6/10 and usually better. Even more important his connect doesn't fuck with Fetanyl which he swears by and assures me of periodically.

•Bags are always fatty, definitely consistent size. Also, bundles are always 10 bags and if anything he mis-counts on the high side or two bags will be taped together and I'll get 11 or 12. It has happened more than once but I've never gotten a short bundle. 

•Amazing Timing. My dude is always parked on the block when I show up. I think he gets there early and scopes out the situation. He's always waiting for me and I've never had to wait for him. This is unheard of mostly.

•Always available, never dry. I call him an hour before I'm gonna show up, once a week, and he is always available during the day. I typically see him in the mornings but I've seen him in the afternoon and evening as well and he's always available unless he's doing something with his kid but this is never the case in the morning which is why that is when I see him.

•He Holds weed, hard and soft as well as D. Recently I've been getting amazing bud from him too when I pick up. Because my habit is only a fraction of what it used to be before I stacked some clean time over the summer I get a 20 jar of bud when I make my weekly pickup which I save most of for when my stash runs out and it makes my already mild detox/WD a cake walk. Last week I scooped a couple $10 jars of hard (he gave me 2/$10 tho) for fun and that shit was absolutely amazing.

•He is a cool dude. This is underrated in my experience with Dboys over the years. When I scoop I get in the whip with him to get things sorted out which has never been an option with past d-boys, they usually just pull up, hand me the D, take the cash and bounce. When I scoop I spend about 10 mins sitting in the whip with my guy while sniffing a few bags and talking sports, women or current events. This aspect makes the whole experience much more chill and I get high before parting ways.

So, is your D-boy an All Star? If he is what do his all-star stats include? If he's not an all-star then why? What makes your d-boy a bum?

Heroin is ruining my life though. My performance at work is dropping from constantly withdrawing because I never have enough money to keep up with my addiction and it's putting me on the verge of being fired. I can't quit cold turkey though. I need methadone or suboxone or something.

The reason why I'm loving this book so far is because he posits a sociological/psychological perspective. He proposes that there is this subculture of heroin addicts and people will try to conform to that image as much as possible. 

Here's an excerpt: ""Heroin use today by lower class, primarily minority group persons does not provide for them a ruphoric escape from the psychological and social problems which derive from ghetto life. On the contrary, it provides a motivation and rationale for the pursuit of a meaningful life, albeit a socially deviant one. The activities these individuals engage in and the relationships they have in the course of their quest for heroin are far more important than the minimal analgesic and euphoric effects."" 

Furthermore, he posits that there are intrinstic rewards that are more important than the high e.g., the thrill of copping, a sense of approval from their peers, especially when they mastered the art of hustling, and a feeling of relief.

Anyways, I know this is kind of a shitpost, but I just thought his take on heroin addiction -- dope fiends being apart of a drug subculture --  is a very interesting theory.",1478043862.0

Nothing will ever compare to my first time. I saw bright summer colors for what felt like the first time in my life. I felt more empathy than ever before. The world was beautiful, and being here was a blessing, not a curse. My problems weren't insurmountable. I *enjoyed talking to people* for fuck's sake, something I've constantly avoided and always considered a chore. Making phone calls wasn't terrifying. Looking in the mirror didn't cause me to lay in bed alone in a dark room for the rest of the day, while my family wonders what's wrong with me. I finally saw everything through the eyes of a normal person, and it was indescribably beautiful.

It was the first and only time I've ever cried from happiness. 

How am I supposed to go back? How am I supposed to forget what it was like to see the world in a new light, to understand happiness, energy, serenity, and love for another human being? Can I ever have those things if I quit?

I don't even know where to start here. It's been so long since I've posted on this subreddit / any reddit at all, since I only ever was on reddit during my addiction so it just makes me think of getting high. I've been clean now for just under 7 months and I'm so happy I finally was able to get myself help. I started off casually using after work and it quickly turned into something nasty. I was using daily and didn't think I had a problem, and really, it wasn't too bad until I had to move for work reasons, at this point I got cut off. I was lucky that time and didn't get sick, but after a few months I started looking for more. It couldn't be that bad, I told myself. I'll keep it under control, and I didn't even get W/D last time I got clean so what harm can it do? Well, I learnt quickly how bad it can get. I spiraled down into addiction within a few months. I did it the first time and after that I couldn't stop. I started to use daily, then I was using every morning, then every day at work and so on. It kept going to the point I couldn't go a few hours without my dose. I had so many lows in such a short amount of months, my dboy would go missing for days at a time and I had no one else to call so I'd be stuck sick as a dog calling him every two hours hoping and praying he'd get back to me. Finally I moved back to my home city.  I had plans on getting clean, I would cut back and only use every now and then. I thought once I was ready I would come down cold turkey and suffer though the W/D with some benzos then be fine. It didn't go that way though,  and I think deep down I knew it wouldn't.  I didn't want to quit. How could I? This was the only thing that was keeping me happy!  Then I got into an accident, and boy was that rough. Every one was fine, but the car was totaled it was a scare. That night I told my family about my addiction and my plan to get clean. And I really did want to get clean, even tried to, but I couldn't do it. I was too weak and ended up making a horrible decision and crashed another car trying to go pick up again while heavily under the influence of benzos (thank god no one was injured). I was so afraid and lost, I didn't know what to do. I needed to get high and I called my dboy and got him to meet up, I don't even remember him showing up to meet me i just remember not having drugs, crashing, walking back home, and then I had drugs. I spent my rent money on those drugs, not even caring and once I had them, I freaked out. I couldn't pay rent! I totaled another car!  What am I going to do! That night I tried to kill myself. I did about 5 times the amount I would normally do in a whole day, plus benzos. I woke up In the hospital. Lucky my family got to me and saved my life. After that we worked our asses off and got into a private clinic to start suboxone within a week or two. I started getting clean, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life. I had to re home all my animals, I lost my home and about 99% of my things, I moved in with my parents and everything was gone. In had to clean out my whole life within 2 weeks of being released from the hospital.  I don't think I've ever cried that much In my entire life. But after some time, I settled in. I was living with my parents and taking some time off work to recover and I was able to see the most amazing thing happen. I remember one day, i was maybe a few weeks clean and i was walking to the store to get some stuff for dinner and i stopped for a second. I was so shocked! I could smell the spring flowers! I hadnt been able to do that for month, due to always snorting my drugs! Then, I started to rebuild my life! Not only was I rebuilding it, but I was creating a new one so much better than anything I had in the past. I was able to mend relationships, focus on myself, go and see friends for more than just getting high! I lived, I went out and did things again, things I have never done before, things things I had missed doing. I started reading again, I play with my dog who thankfully I was able to keep though all this, I went to movies, bought new clothes, went to dinner, i went on picnics, i went rafting, hell i would somedays just go out and enjoy a nice day! Piece by piece I started to get my life back. These past few months have been some of the hardest of my life,  but I have also been blessed enough to have some of the best memories created within them. I still haven't fully recovered and I still have cravings, I go to NA almost every week (whenever possible). I have so much to fix still, including debt, mental issues, finding a new job getting clean from suboxone, ext.  But I am happier than I have been in years! I wanted to take a second and say thank you to all the redditors out there, you gave me some good laughs, some great advice,  and helped me though more hard times than I can count! To my best friend out there, if you read this, thank you. Thank you thank you thank you, because I know that if I didn't have you there beside me though all this I don't know where I would be today. I love you. 


And to all you reading this,  just remember, this Isn't the end for you, this isn't all your life can ever be! You can get clean, and stay clean. It takes so much hard work but in the end it is so worth it! 

Thank you for those who read this, I hope my story can give you strength to start on the road to recovery and if you aren't ready yet, that's ok. That's the biggest lesson I learnt from all this, a drug addict can't get clean till they are ready to do so!

This past summer I had roughly 2 ounces of opium. One time deal . that lasted me all summer and I got high reaaaally pretty much every night. It was banging shit too. Light brown not that dark shit. Not sticky at all. I both smoked and ate it. Smelt like flowers. After the summer I started fucking with oxy and opana and Dilly's. My last oxy pickup was fent pressed fakes. 440 down the drain. Luckily I have plenty of money so I just wrote it off as a loss. But after taking them for a few days I realised how high my tollyy has gotten. I still only need 30-40 mg of op oxy to get high or one 8mg dilly snorted if I wanna get wrecked. But the fact that I was fine with taking fentt pills and haven't flushed them shows me I am for sure mentally addicted. Along with the fact I have actually recently blown off friends to get high recently (I did this sometimes over the summer, but I have done it more recently) They aren't even close to being dosed right. At times a quarter of a fake op 80 is nothing. At times it rocks me hard. I'm gonna get one more pick up of oxy 30 ops from my main guy (he hates fent and says fent cutters and pressers should be raped in prison by the biggest blackest prisoner) but along with that. I'm gonna get hydro's to taper. My question and reason for this post. Is 30-40 10 mg hydro's enough for me to taper? would you recommend a rapid taper or a long one. I'm thinking long one. I don't think i need sub's i don't think I've reached that point. Once I'm off opiates anytime I wanna get high I'll eat like 5 100-250 mg weed edibles or take massive worm dabs.

I went home for his funeral.  I was completely sober and could not seem to find anything to just numb me, no matter who I called, nothing seemed to work out.  I sat through his funeral and burial without anything.  It sounds weird but I looked up ways online to keep myself from crying and I found one that worked.  I spent the entire funeral pinching the skin between my thumb and finger.  I pinched both hands so hard they bled and I also but my lip inside s hard that it was bleeding.  But I did not cry.  
He didn't OD or anything he's not a piece of shit like me.  He was an amazing person, the kind of person who makes you feel more amazing just to be in his presence.  I believe in an afterlife and spirituality and stuff and sometimes I think the worst thing about him dying before me is that now he knows the truth about the kind of person I am.  I'm the kind of person who is selfish enough to care about how my brother might see me now that he's dead.  He was the kind of person who was genuinely kind and loving no matter how fucked up his sister was, I could never tell that maybe he didn't approve in some way, but I always felt embarrassed about the dumb things, like if I spilled some coffee in his car and I could tell he was disappointed but brushed it off so easily.  
He died just suddenly one day.  The neighbor heard his wife screaming for help.  He died of a heart attack.  We had plans to have lunch soon.
I don't think I can go home ever again and know he's not there because it will absolutely break me.  
I haven't been able to find anything since then.  I've been completely sober not by choice. And I'm so fucked up that basically all I can think about is finding something so I can just not feel anything, just for a minute.  Because I'm losing the energy to forcefully keep myself from feeling and I think if that falls apart then I will just break.

I used to be a daily black tar heroin smoker/IVer, but now for the past three weeks I have been on a methadone maintenance program which essentially takes most of the ""monkey off my back"".

However, last week my regular connect managed to get his hands on some OC 80s which I obviously had to buy. I picked up 5 of them for $60 each ($300), which considering the typical $1 per milligram price of oxycodone in blues (Roxicodone 30mg go for $30), is a steal.

Due to my ridiculously annoying high tolerance I essentially must IV these pills in order to feel them (I'm on 75mg methadone daily...). Using a micron filter I got a beautiful clear oxycodone solution which I proceeded to shoot was an absolute treat. 

I honestly prefer the euphoric, motivating oxycodone high to heroin which is a little more sedating. In a perfect world I would just have cheap access to oxycodone; if only I was involved in this scene back in the era of pill mills and doctors with liberal prescription pads.

All of them were 4 or 5 years outdated. Since I was bored all the time and my life sucked I started taking those daily.

During about four months I was on about 400mg tramadol and various benzo doses. I stopped mid-august and slowly tappered down the benzos. 
The tramadol withdrawals were really hard for me (RLS, Couldn't sleep, Pain everywhere, Deep sadness etc.) but I did it. I didn't do tramadol until two days ago, I decided to take 150mg cuz I was bored. 

I took a single 150mg dose and the next day I'm sweating, mild muscle pains, headache and cant sleep just like when I was in withdrawal. So I took 100mg and now im all better. Is it normal that a single small dose put me in wd? Am I just really sensitive or just a nasty ass crying baby?

Intranasal: When I have tar I usually make muddy water. Only problem with that is I feel like most of it ends up going down my throat and ends up being wasted.

Or I've read about a method of adding water to it and drying it out in the microwave to form a snortabel powder of some sort but I'd think the heat would break down the product and make it less potent.

I guess plugging is my next option. I have no reservations about putting drugs in my butt, but opiates tend to back me up and I don't want it all to be absorbed by waste and have no effect.

TLDR: I've tried a few methods but none seem to work as well as just snorting some good ole ecp. Can't afford to waste much. My next sack will probably be my last for a while due to financial reasons. So I just want to make the most of it before I have to put down the opiates for a while and get my life in order.

Thanks for any help guys. I've lurked here for a long time. You guys have always been the best.",1478117273.0

Mate, you were my best friend, you're still here, as here as a rock is present.

You aren't who you were, I can't ever see who you were again. 

I last seen you at the police station, I stopped but boy was I hesitant. 

I'm sure looking back I could have helped more, however after you everything you still blamed her. 

You this is my attempt at writing a poem.

Terrible just like it's my attempt to validate my never knowing. 

Knowing what to do, who to seek. 

Being ever afraid that I'll want to have a peek. 

A peek at how it feels, a taste of all the thrills.

Your new best friend giving you feelings, that all of us couldn't compare. 

When you went to rehab and wanted change, it was a breath of fresh air.

Though you couldn't continue without the thought of your best friend. 

I'm just afraid I would be there to see it end. 

I left and you never seen me again, if I was a stronger man, I wouldn't have been scared. 

I can justify it a million ways, the end truth is, I wasn't all quite there. 

I know your end is coming.
I won't appear at your funeral.

For the end isn't the physical death.

I don't want to stop trying, trying this poem or trying to stop my thoughts.

Full of the good times, we laughed, we cried, we dropped, we struggled.

I stopped, you didn't, I hated that life, you did too. I left it, don't know how, you tried too but couldn't avail. 

You're still my best friend, the memories are ever present, I'm sorry I am not there, hope you don't resent. 

What the fuck am I writing, just empty thoughts! I didn't know I was there to talk. 

I hate what you've done and how I little I did. We were going to conquer the world, where are you? 

I can't be angry! I want too but it's not my story, I miss you and I don't want my next time to see you, will be at the viewing.

I have a son you know? You'd love him. 

Hope he will meet you, the former you. 

The real you, I hope to see again. Until than dear friend, don't go too far. Please kick that needle and our friendships, unlike your arm, shall bear no scars. ",1478115182.0

Finland is testing basic income soon. They are planning on testing 560€/month. If it would come true the amount would probably have to be higher, since even now you get something like 700€ if you are unemployed (one of the few reasons I love my country).

The concept has been criticized because some think people would turn too lazy. On the other hand many say the amount is too small so people would want to look for jobs. Also it would make entrepreunership easier, and most people want to do something productive anyway.

What would you do? Would you just do dope?

I think I would still search for a job, but I might settle on a part-time job to make a few extra euros. That would mean more free time to focus on art again maybe... Or studying. Would probably still use drugs though I am trying to quit. I think.",1478111593.0

It's been fun but I guess it's time to quit. It's gonna suck ass but it's for the best. I'm a senior in high school, and I've been doing oxymorphone for about a month, and was doing oxycodeine a bit before that. Opiates have been my DOC from my first use of them. if I wanted to get high, I could just dope out if I wanted, but if I wanted to function, I could simply adjust my dose, and just feel happy and confident and relaxed thoughout the day. Not to mention it keeps my migraines and neck and shoulder pain away. But TIFU, or rather had some bad luck. I got up as I normally do, and took about 15mg of oxymorphone (equivalent to like 30mg of oxycodeine) before I went to school. On the way I pounded down some coffee (so a bit of a baby speedball). I got to my first period, Econ. I was sitting in class when suddenly my heart started pounding at the normal frequency, but very hard. Then suddenly I felt cold and light headed. My heart stopped, for about 2 seconds. Then it picked back up extremely rapidly possibly trying to compensate for earlier. I debated going to the nurse because I didn't want to get busted, but ended up going anyway because my heart was going nuts and I felt dizzy. I didn't get busted, however I did get sent home. When I got to the nurse my blood pressure was 155/90 while laying down on a bed. It eventually returned to normal. This event happened after another previous scare involving seratonin syndrome with MDMA (I was a retard and forgot they could interact, and I was coming down and ended up having to vomit up the pill to prevent possible SS). Not here to bash opiates, they are pretty wonderful substances in their effects, but maybe it's for the best I've had all this shit happen before I went too far down that road. For those of you quitting good luck, and for those of you doing, have safe and happy nods.

The year 2016 has been a real turning point in my relationship with drugs and alcohol. It all started a year earlier however, these things take time. In 2015, April specifically, the year I turned 30, I did some reflecting and decided to move on from the party lifestyle I lived through my twenties. The lifestyle consisting of routine weekend partying in nyc, the party house atmosphere, hitting bars on weeknights to watch sports and get drunk, music festivals all summer, living off takeout food, small time hustling, excessive drug use, etc. was inevitably coming to an end. This isn't something that immediately occurs though, transitioning to a new way of living takes time and a lot of effort. I had made the decision though, it was time for a change. It was time to grow up. My adult life was calling.

As the summer of my 30th year (2015) came to an end so did my apartment lease at my current party house. At this time it had been a few months since my realization that I needed to make some major changes in my life so I opened up to my family about my feelings and my parents welcomed me to live at home to get away from the lifestyle I had been living for a decade. This was a year and two months ago. Being welcomed home to transition to my responsible adult life was an enormous weight off my shoulders. I knew that removing myself from my current, toxic social life was essential to making the changes I desired. 

After living at home for a few months as the season changed from summer to fall I had successfully removed myself from the party lifestyle. There was a problem though, something that I hadn't opened up to my family about, my heroin addiction that was going strong for 3 years at this point. I was proud of the lifestyle change I had made but dealing with opiate addiction isn't as easy as removing yourself from a toxic atmosphere. I had a lot of work to do addressing an addiction that was a product of a decade of ""partying"".

I was physically dependent on heroin at this point in my life. Also, I was not ready to disclose this issue to my family and I continued using for the first 6/7 months living at home. It is now April of 2016 and I had completely abandoned the party lifestyle but my dope problem was still going strong. I had just worked a long day near nyc in North Jersey and copped a bundle in Newark on my way home to suburbia. I sniffed three bags and had taken some xanax earlier to get through the work day. About 20 minutes into my drive home I began to nod super hard and was having trouble maintaining lane control and steady speed. After about 5 minutes of reckless driving I was being pulled over by state police. They finally caught up to me. I was arrested for possession CDS, DWI and reckless driving. I managed to handle the situation without getting my parents involved however they found out about everything a couple weeks later when the lawyer letters flooded the mailbox daily and I couldn't keep up with sorting the mail. 

A couple days after being arrested, prior to my parents finding out my troubles with the law, I knew the inevitable was going to happen (having to tell them about my arrest) so I had decided to open up to them about my addiction. This was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Understandably my parents were terrified and worried sick. They were however supportive and relieved that I was honest with them and ready to take on the challenge of conquering my addiction. I was allowed the opportunity to handle my problem on my own by taking time off work and detoxing at home. I endured two weeks of pure hell going cold turkey aside from one suboxone strip, a couple xanax bars and a gram of weed. Those supplies lasted through the first week and when my stash dried up the second week of my detox was the real deal. By the 15th day it was my 31st birthday and I was finally feeling better. A couple days later they found out about my arrest but the blow was softened by my agonizing, dedicated effort to get clean.

This initial attempt at sobriety lasted 44 days, the longest I had been completely clean and sober my entire adult life. Everything was going great in regards to my relationship with my parents, trust was being rebuilt, I was eating healthy and gaining weight, I was exercising routinely and I was back at work. As many of you know, when everything starts going well, relapse is a reality and it happened to me. I thought I was slick for a few weeks in June but one Saturday afternoon I had taken too much xanax and sniffed a few bags and my parents confronted me about nodding out. I was busted. We had a weekend trip to Vermont planned out the next weekend with my dad and brother and when I returned it was time to get help. My parents were proud and impressed by my effort and desire to be clean but ""they heard"" heroin addiction isn't something you can address on your own and outside support is needed when an addict is struggling.

At the end of june, with court adjourned until September, I began an IOP program as well as attending NA regularly. I was clean again. This time the transition from using to sobriety was much smoother because my use had not gotten out of control and the detox/WD was minimal. I successfully completed the IOP in 8/9 weeks and by the time I had court I was 75 days clean. Knowing that I was going to lose my license however I decided to stock up and use again. It has been 6/7 weeks now since I lost my license after pleading guilty to DWI (all other charges/felonys were dropped) and I have been using a few days a week since facing the judge. I have continued to abstain from alcohol and other recreational drug use however I recently stocked up with a brick, some hard and some weed. 

My recent pickup, I decided today, will be my last pickup for a while. One in recovery can only hope it will be my last pickup ever but for now (when my stash dries up) it's back to one day at a time. I have been practicing self control my past few pickups and I am confident that I can ration my stash to the point where I taper off as it diminishes. I am prepared and excited to do this. I refuse to binge until it's gone and suffer through painful WD. I am ready to execute incredible self control and skip days as my stash dwindles to find relief from using a couple bags on the following day. I know how to trick myself into believing that the stash is gone only to taper the following day with a bag or two. Not only am I mentally prepared to do this right I  am excited to do this right. 

I can get high a couple more times and then it's time for serious self control and rationing. I can do this because I want to do this. I am ready to get clean again. My goal is to be off dope in 10-14 days with the last 5-7 days as my taper with the last of my stash. I'm saving the weed that I scooped for once the dope runs out and plan on pairing that with the basic OTC remedies once my taper is complete and my dope is gone. I plan on being completely clean again and feeling well by Thanksgiving when I will be embarking on a cold weather hiking and camping weekend trip with my Dad and Brother.

This trip is my initial motivation to successfully taper and be well by the end of the month and I refuse to fail. Another motivation is to not let my use get out of control again entering winter as I refuse to be sick in the cold weather. Ultimately though I have logged a lot of clean time this year and I want to end 2016 and begin 2017 on a clean streak and see where it takes me. I'm going to enjoy my high while my stash is fat however I am starting to practice my self control immediately by being careful not to re-dose wastefully or use excessively in any way. This is the only way I want to do it this time and because my physical dependency hasn't gotten out of control (not using every day since relapsing) and I have a goal to be prepared for around Thanksgiving I am confident and excited about this journey.

I will post updates and discussion along the way - if you took the time to read this I sincerely thank you and hope you found my story and delivery of it both interesting and entertaining. I am open to all criticism as well as support and hope to get some legit feedback on this post and my plan to get clean to finish out 2016 and begin 2017. I truly hope this gets read and reviewed. I am at peace with my decision. Happy nods today r/opiates fam!

I had moved back home to city 2 from city 1 2 years ago to start methadone and live at home while I stabilize. I got really stable on 88mgs and got a job working for a wholesale nursery. I moved back to  the green rush capital in the rockies to start in a grad program in Data Science. Anyway to the point, while I was still in city 1 I made a plan with my friend, lets call him, idk, let's say RetardedPigFuckAsshole, for him to send me a gram of shards($80) and he could take a 0.2 and keep whatevers left after shipping it(~$15). Great, so I Western Union-ed it with no issues. So the nest day he says that noone has any and that he was gonna come back the next day. So the following day he said that was able to score a dub but his guy was all out until the end of the week. I tell him to try and find more but if he couldn't by the next day to just mail the dub and we'd figure the rest out later.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, low and behold I didn't hear from him for 3 months, when I ran into him on the street in cityt1 once I'd moved back. So he tells me that he got arrested and that he didn't answer or call me back because I thought I wouldn't believe him(he must be psychic). So he tells me that he doesn't have $100 all at once but he has some doope he'll give me and he can do that whenever he has some and is in town until he pays me back.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say no problem, obviously, we go upstairs to my place and he gives me a decent 20. So a month goes by, he has given me 7 dubsacks to make up for the wait and him ignoring my calls for so long. So we're all good. I have been working for the Hillary campaign and I got him hired at the same office so he comes by my apt before we have work and we've been running partners ever since we met back up. Sometimes I have the money/dope, sometimes he has the money/dope. Standard running partner shit. Onto today.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway he has work today but I don't as I have grad school class at 6:30. He asks if he can still come by before work to shower and I say, ""Yea, fine."". He comes by and I ask him if he has any money/dope, he says that he has money but he can't use today as he has a drug test for his probation. I say okay fine but I'm going to cop for me then. You can stay here and shower while I go cop.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come back to every junkies friends worst nightmare. He is slumped on the floor just outside my bathroom door. I immediately start slapping him in the face as hard as I can, he wakes up immediately but he is still very high, it's bad but obvious that he isn't dying. Now that I know that, and even though he is awake I slap him even harder across each cheek again. Why would I do such a thing you ask? Because when I found him on my floor, I also found my bathroom sink running completely overrun the sink and had flooded the entirety of teh bathroom and has soaked my entire wall to wall carpet in a 1/4"" of water. I had shut it off as soon as I saw it, I now threw anything that might soak some water up onto the floor as I could. The towels barely even touched it, I threw the entirety of my wardrobe over the water and after a TON of pounding carpet I got it so there was no longer any standing water, just a metric shit ton of wet clothing.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in between me just completely going off on him, including me saying that I planned on giving him some of the dope I scored that there was no way he was getting any now, I started prepping my shot. I had gotten two different types of dope as one of my guys owed me a $20 and I had bought a $20 from a different guy. He asks to look at the chunk that I wasn't cooking up, I say fine whatever(at this point I'm just trying to get the dope soaked water in my spoon into the veins as soon as possible). He puts the chunk of dope back on the table and it's half the size that it was 5 seconds ago. He immediately starts denying it, I get a flash of it in his mouth so I fucking force him to the ground and take that shit right back in, let's say not in a gentle caring manner. I immediately kick him out, yelling obscenities at him the whole way. His escuse, that he did it since I was being so mean about not giving him any of the dope I just scored when I said I would. Unbelievable, he told me he couldn't do any dope today because of his drug test, he obviously lied about having any dope in the beginning AND he obviously didn't need anymore dope as he had just ODed.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might think that is the end of The Tale of The Terrible Person Even by Junkie Standards, but you would be wrong. So I eventually get him out of my house and start to gather the mountain of wet clothes to bring them down to the dryer in my building, he has stolen the $6 in quarters I use for laundry. At this point any trust I had in him evaporated and I inventories everything in the apartment, luckily he didn't steal any hardware , but he did steal about 30 of my 600mg gabapentin. When I finally get him on the phone he says that yea he borrowed the $6 and that he doesn't understand why I'm so pissed at him. ",1478239247.0

I had just spent 9 months in the county jail & was three weeks removed from state confinement. Finally made bond! But was placed on house arrest. Oh well, better than eating food fit for a prisoner (literally) & sleeping on top of a 2-inch plastic mattress & steel bed frame, right? 

So working a new job, and Friday is motherfucking payday! Get dude to deliver to my place, grab some caps (scramble, beans, whatever you wanna call it) & proceed to nearly jizz my pants in excitement. I'm gonna get higher than Mt. Everest! Bust open 1 of the caps, rail it & proceed to be enveloped in the warmth of no-tolerance opiate bliss. 

Here's where things started to get...funny, to say the least. 

Instead of that familiar euphoria we all know & love, I felt a wave of extreme sedation creep up over a period of about 5 minutes. And FUCK! was my nose as itchy as that cartoon show cat off of The Simpsons. This is when I decided to take not 1, not 2, but 3 fucking Benadryls! I was asleep within a few minutes.

Fast forward to 3 days later. I woke up in the hospital, strapped to the bed, breathing tube stuck down throat, miles of IV lines & a fucking catheter diddling my pee-pee hole. Brother found me apparently covered in puked-up bile, passed out on my arm & struggling to breath through the vomit that was in my mouth & that I had inhaled into my lungs. Had been out for what they thought was about 4 hours.

When I woke up, I couldn't move my right arm & straight thought it was paralyzed. Doctor said if it had been much longer & I didn't die, they might have had to amputate it. Two Narcan shots didn't wake me up either. Toxicology report came back positive for carfentanil.

Seriously peeps...TEST SHOTS & LINES! Thought I was safe from overdosing just cause I wasn't IV-ing, but man was I fucking wrong. I could have been just another statistic. The thought of my crying mother placing flowers on my coffin is a sobering reminder of the perils of this lifestyle that we live.

Too many good people are dying cause of this fucking shit.

I took 1 and 3/4 OP 60's and drank some Poppy Seed Tea about 9 hours earlier, albeit it was weak. I have family who I've asked to check on me periodically throughout the night. Should I be okay? 

I realize that this was likely careless of me, but with my tolerance and them being extended release, I should be fine, right? I'm nodding, yes, but not to the point of visuals or etc.

Here are my dose times:
-3:01PM - Poppy Seed Tea

-7:13PM - About 1/4 an OP 60

-7:29PM - About 1/4 an OP 60

-7:32PM - About 1/4 an OP 60

-8:21PM - About 1/4 an OP 60 (rest of that pill)

-9:11PM - Small dose of Nyquil, per directions on the back

-9:53PM - 1/4 of an OP 60 (exact)

-10:19PM - 1/4 of an OP 60 (exact)

-11:15PM - Another 1/4 of an OP 60 (last dose)

Yesterday I did 50mg IR and then took an OP 60 a few hours later, even mixed it with about 8 grams of Kratom, and I was fine. Now that I think about that experience, I'm not even sure what the point of me posting this was aside from this dose consisting entirely of OP's and me having no experience with Oxy's ER formula.

Any help/advice is greatly appreciated. I'm most likely just being paranoid, as I do have a very high tolerance. But when can I expect this to peak/after what time will I know that I am safe to sleep?

I also get epidurals every 3 months in my neck and low back. My chronic pain issues stem from multiple neck/back traumas from several car accidents and 2 major falls, 1 from a tree the other from a hayloft in my grandparent's barn head first onto concrete floor.

So I go in to see my pm Doc yesterday to address a new issue with my neck to talk options, possible surgery etc. 

Welp, first of all I sat in the waiting room for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I shit you not. When I was finally called back my doc starts telling me how bad long term treatment with opiates/opiods is for our bodies. He goes on to say that ""new research"" shows that they can cause your brain to tell your body there is pain when there is none. And get this...how long term painkiller use actually ages people faster. He kept saying this is new research that just came out and how he's so sorry for ever prescribing these meds and omg!! my head was spinning....this was actually happening...he's just gonna stop rxng my Norco.

But hold on, he has a solution. Wants me to give buprenorphine a try....not right exactly now but very soon. I had tons of questions. He answered a few, bullshitted his way thru some more and told me by all means research. He assured me I had done nothing wrong and that I most certainly aren't the only patient being switched and he did admit finally that yes, a lot of this is our lovely government 😡

So, I have no idea what dose he will start me at. All I know is that I have to be off norco/narcotics for 48 hours before starting the buprenorphine. 

I'm posting this here because you guys know more about buprenorphine than most cpers. 

I need to know what to expect as far as how it's going to make me feel? How well will it relieve my pain? 

I'm scared, pissed, anxious and all kinds of worried. I feel like I'm being punished and being forced to start all over again. This whole thing just sucks so bad.

The second were complete addiction nazis - they wanted him to go into inpatient detox for alcohol because he drinks a sixer a day. Come on, half of America would be in detox if that was a big deal. To write him for subs they want him to quit drinking, quit smoking weed, and go to counseling like 4x a week with random piss tests.

But i sure figured it out.

Well anyways i was up working late and i had brought me a bag of ecp and had snorted around .2. Well i did one last line and something happened.... I started feeling like i couldn't stand or talk and in my head i was scared for my life. I got the rest of the bag and gave it away. I decided enough is enough. The next day when i woke up and bam i started puking my guys out, sweating... holy shit... i shit my fucking pants too. The next day i had been puking so much that i saw a little bit of blood and i went to the hospital. There, they gave me a NG. I don't know what it stands for but it's a tug they shove down your nose to your throat and the end of it sits right where your tonsils are. And they held me down because i couldn't sit still. I was gagging constantly and vomiting and they were vacuuming it up and i was puking blood from the big ass cut that tube made. It was scary gagging feeling like you can't breathe or swallow for like an hour. They wouldn't help me when i told them im done with treatment Im leaving they wouldn't do shit. I was having a panic attack and my heart rate shot to 138 and i thought i was dying and the nurses never came to help me calm down. They just left me inn there gagging for what seemed like a day and half. Finally the nurse got me of that pump and pulled the tube out and i said Im done, i refuse further service and i left.  I felt sick the next few days but as long as i smoked weed i could get up and move a good bit and eat and sleep.

That whole thing really shook me for some reason. Opened my eyes. Fuck you heroin you beautiful fucking piece of shit. I didn't eat for a week. Didn't sleep for a couple days. Then slept like crazy. Weed has helped me with this wd bullshit. It calmed my anxieties.  It makes me realize life aint so bad. I know I'm replacing it in a sense (i smoked weed but not too much.

My brother has struggled with addiction for the last 14 years. His opiate addiction started with popping pills in high school and he has turned to heroin for at least a few years. I don’t really know the extent of the addiction, but I think it has gotten really bad. It is hard to say since he won't talk about it. I have been lurking in this sub to try to get a better idea of what he is going through and I was hoping you people could give some guidance. I will give a bit of context.

Last year he was a passenger in a car crash where he got banged up pretty bad. He received over $100k in insurance money a little over 6 months ago. He took this money to move out of my parents’ house and get his own place. He has never held a steady job or had his own place so this was a big deal for him. He said he was going to go back to school, get a job, and invest some of it but that never happened. Fast forward 6 months and all the money is gone. It is one thing to score when you can afford it, but when the money runs out is when it makes me worry. 

We have always suspected heroin but never could prove it and he has always denied it up and down. He has a long history of constantly lying and stealing so it makes it really hard to know how he is really doing. I won’t hear from him for weeks at a time and when he was at home he always had massive mood swings. Either very talkative and outgoing or extremely irritable. This combined with the irregular sleep patterns and tiny pupils all points to opiates.

My parents spoke with one of his friends today and they confirmed what we had been thinking all along. He is a full blown heroin addict and really needs help. His friend doesn't talk to him that much anymore because of how bad it has gotten. He has really pushed that cares about him away from him. My mom went to see him today but he wouldn’t answer the door. She said she knows about his heroin problem but he ignores her and says he isn’t home despite his car being parked out front. He has lost around 30lbs in the last 6 months and has been looking really bad lately. We still haven’t heard from him since trying to talk to him about it this morning.  

My whole family hasn’t had much of a relationship with him for a long time as the constant lying and stealing is hard to get past. We want nothing but the best for him, but he doesn’t listen to anyone and thinks everyone is out to get him. We have tried to get him help countless times and he doesn’t think he has a problem. We have spent countless hours trying to talk to him about it but it has done no good. He always thinks he knows best and plays the victim card whenever he can. 

I am scared we are coming to the end of the road where something drastic might happen. If he doesn’t get help, he either comes to the house and gets violent with my parents, he kills himself, or he ends up in jail. He isn’t even 30 and I feel he has already thrown his life away. He is incredibly smart and used to have the world by the balls but his addiction has gotten the best of him. He has been an addict for so long that I don’t really remember what he was like when he was sober but he is still my brother and I want to see him get clean.  

I am hoping he will hit rock bottom soon and realize he has a problem and want to get help, but I am just afraid rock bottom will come too late. 

So my question is, what can I do in this situation? How do you help someone who doesn’t want to be helped?

Now that I've said this: what would the equivalent in H to about 90mg of blues? How far apart do my dose of subs to H need to be to actually feel the H? What's the best ROA for 2mg subs that is not the needle? I know some people are going to say ""don't pick up H"" but I'm going to do this regardless, I just want to be safe about it.

So. Here's the thing. I was a heavy Hydromorph Contin and fentanyl user for five years. Towards the end, last November, I was sniffing about 500mg/day of HMC. Yes, heavy. I went on Sub, 24mg, and veeeeeery gradually tapered down to currently 8mg/day. I haven't taken Sub since last Saturday and am just starting to feel the RLS and other withdrawal bullshit starting to rear its ugly head. I'm itching for a taste so I am going to get the old crusher out and grind up those little white beads from the hydromorph caps to go up my nasal passage (don't lecture, I fucking know)... however after being on high dose Sub for so long I have no fucking clue how to assess my tolerance anymore... never been in this situation before. Any thoughts? Conversions for bupe are so flakey it's not funny.

In the interest of harm reduction, anyone have any thoughts on what I may be able to get away with? To add some food for thought, if I go 3-4 days off Sub, taking 16mg (Sub) can make me feel chill as fuck although I wouldn't say high. 24mg just makes me puke now.

Thanks for your well-intentioned advice.

Today I come home.from work and find her basically passed out in her own shit wrapped up heat blazing. I got her to the shower she passed out shit some more. Then shit on the floor.  Then I put her in her dressing room and she fell out and shit on the floor. 

Should I take pictures of what's going on and show her when she's hopefully on this planet some day and show her how she's going to look to our child. Or is that too cruel.

I feel she needs to be shamed and guilted to understand what shes doing to our kid or is that to much? Is she really quitting or is she using.

I hope everyone here is happily high (or happily clean) tonight. I'm currently not happily anything, and I need a favor from you guys. 

Those of you who know me have undoubtedly heard me talk about my wife at great length. She's basically the best person on the world, and is hands down the greatest thing that ever happened to me. She is aware of my addiction, and endlessly supportive of my efforts to get clean. She's done a lot of reading on the subject, and is more knowledgeable than a lot of people that actively use, even though she's never been a user. But research does not necessarily bring with it understanding, which is where you guys come in. 

She gets frustrated, because she'll know I'm taking a run at a kick. And she'll watch me suffer through the hell of withdrawal that we all know so well, and emerge victorious on the other side. But she can't wrap her mind around why someone would go through all that, only to pick back up in a few weeks or months. Can you guys help me explain what leads us to do this? What is PAWS like for you guys, and have you ever fought through The Sickness in an honest attempt to get clean, only to succumb a little bit down the line? Why did you decide to get high when you did? 

Thank you guys so much. You know that I love each and every one of you.

Obviously getting a habit in the first place wouldn't have got me into this problem. I've been using for a little over a year now. I made a concerted effort to quit in May, and I was sober for almost a month from heroin. (I need to quit now because of money constraints and my family cutting me off) I did not go the suboxone route because I wanted to be done. For about 5 days of withdrawal I wasn't able to work out, much less keep food down. My appetite never really got back to normal. When I was high I could eat, eat, eat, and lift back to back days and sleep 9 hours to recover. 

After 1 week of quitting I got a trazadone script. Didn't do shit, so I copped lorazapam, which helped more except I was not sleeping more than 5-6 hours a night. 

Almost a month clean, and I didn't have enough energy to lift more than 4 times a week. I lost 5 ibs, and put on a layer of fat around the muscle I did have. 

I went back to using until August when I wanted to get clean again, this time with the help of loperamide. I learned that loperamide was an opioid, which triggered me to research how to unlock its potential since it's so cheap. Now I'm using 80 pills a day of loperamide, and I've read that this stuff has longer withdrawals than heroin due to the half life being 14 hours at least. Therefore such lengthy withdrawals is only going to prolong the shitty appetite and insomnia that makes it impossible to gain muscle.

There must be bodybuilding opiate addicts who have dealt with this. ",1478315486.0

I haven't taken opiates in over a year. I had a wonderful doctor who I finally developed rapport with, until 4 months ago when I went to fill my subutex script and found out my doctor had passed away. Not the greatest way to find out someone who saved your life is gone, amidst some withdraws and a new job. I find the sketchiest of new doctors who basically ignores what I say and claims that subutex cannot be prescribed where I now live. I do not believe him, but have experienced far worse side effects that I ever recall having. Since switching, my dose has gone from 4mg-8mgs to 8mgs - 12mgs. I fucking hate this juxtaposition from seeing an end to this and being able to forget doses until I was in withdraw to a constant feeling of illness, nausea, insomnia, depression, and all of that ""fun stuff"". I don't want to go dark market to find subutex as it will probably be expensive and if you're shopping for diet soda, you don't go to a place that sells ice cream, candy, and super sugared soda right there. I got a tip from a medically trained individual that if I can prove a slight allergy to the naloxone that my doctor can ""cover his ass"" (Like anyone would actually pursue bupe as a criminal racket) and I can convince him to transfer me  back to a medication that has worked for me for a year with no incident.

While it does have some good points, I think the overall message is wrong. I was shown this video in rehab and we were all asked to create our own version of a rat park (kind of demeaning to ask a bunch of grown adults to do a kindergarten-level drawing project, but whatever).

The video doesn't take into account the simple fact that rats aren't humans. Humans are much more complex than rats are. We live in a physical world AND a mental world, and the two rarely line up with each other. You might have everything you could ever want out of life- education, friends, relationships, possessions, jobs, etc. But that isn't enough for a lot of people. I had everything I could have ever wanted in my ""rat park"" and I still fell into substance abuse. Hell, most people I used with had the exact same scenario I did.

The recent surge of opiate use in middle and upper-middle class areas should automatically throw this experiment into question.

My older sis has been a heroin addict for years, finally recently went to rehab, and got out acting the same way as before she went in. Still constant suspicion of drug use.
On one hand, she's my sister and I don't want to give up on a family member. I know addiction must be a huge struggle and very stressful. I cant begin to grasp what herion addiction must be like.
on the other hand, after rehab and years of other stuff, i feel that there needs to be a certain amount of consequences to her actions. I'm younger than her and we both live with my mom. my mom continues to give second chances, which i'm not sure is helping my sister or just enabling her addiction. if she seems unwilling to help herself, will us giving up on her be a change she needs?

I know between the addiction and all the depressions/anxieties at the root of the addiction must be incredibly challenging to deal with. but if she isn't looking to go to school, find any job, apologize for her actions, accept any responsiblity, is there anything WE can do to help her?

I have clonodine, neurontin, etizolam, and poppy seed tea. In regards to usual vitamins and supplements. 

I have a very socially demanding job, and a girlfriend I can't let know that I am going through WD.

1. How bad are these WDs going to be after 5-6 days of heavy use?

2. I have been a daily kratom user for around 2 years now, so I have plenty lying around but I don't know if it will help much since my body is already so used to it. 

3. Can I use Poppy Seed Tea to help with my WDs? 

4. Is there a quick way to get in with a doctor to get suboxone?

5. What are things I can do to make this as painless and as least obvious as possible (very important to make sure the people around me aren't aware).

I'm in the UK and received some grey/brown rocky heroin. Most people telling me that it's most likely #3. **(advertised as afghani)**

The vendor himself recommends smoking it, and after trying this, although it works, it's not amazing, and everyone knows smoking is a great way to lose your stash quick.

When I first picked up I wanted to snort it, so I shaved the very dry rocks and made small lines. I was bumping all day and got nice and warm, but nowhere close to a nod, not even close to what 300mg of DHC does to me.

One night I added a little bit of **lemon oil** to my line, stirred the goo, and waited. I had no patience and just snorted the goo.

** I found it came on harder and felt stronger. **

Is this placebo or is there something to this?

So far, as a guy addicted to mainly codeine and DHC, I'm fairly disappointed by heroins potency. Is this my tolerance and my overestimation of the drugs potency, or am i doing things wrong? **(I've caught some big hits off the foil).**

TLDR: does adding citric acid to #3 make snorting it more potent?

Told I may get in trouble in a month,"Left my dboys house as I usually used to. But decided I'm going to make a uturn and go home a different route because I wanted to hit up some MTO sheets food. Going this way allows me to go threw the worse part of the hood. I went to one of my spots (gas station called Shady's) to do a quick line to make the 20 minute ride to sheets a nice one. I scramble for a CD case, place it on my center console and open my fold. 


Its completely white, I remember my dboy saying ""be careful my roach was faded for hours of half a point."" I quickly open my fold and with my card slide out a line a gel pen would draw. 


As soon as I go back to my kit to get my snooter a new gmc suv/van thing comes speeding up slammin their brakes, park next to me and start screaming don't you fucking dare! Put your hands up now! 


Fuck me...I'm in my girls leased vehicle, she thought I was just out getting us lunch. They open the car ask where my needles were at and put cuffs on me. I sit in the back of their nice car, still with that new car smell. Asking me series of questions to which some I knew some I didn't. 


One was an older female (complete cunt) and the other around the so,e ave as me, late 20s male. 


The lady asks me where did I get this? Tell her down the road, cold copped from a dude named D. Immediately tells me I'm lying as these folds are a signature to a known trap house and she followed me leave there. Which wasn't true..which I laughed and told her the town 30 minutes away also folds up their dubs with lottery paper as it's easy to keep the powder in the origami fold. 


She wasn't having it. Believed non of it. Then I'm told I'm going to the local station to be processed. I asked what about the car since its not mine and if I could please call my soon to be wife and let her pick it up at the least. She says no. 


While the bitch starts searching the car I make small talk with the male officer, tell him I'm not sure how this works considering this is my first time in this situation. He kind of mumbled something to which I don't remember. 


I then try to get him to open up a bit more and say, ""hey since your task force you also with my one of my good friends ______ who also works this area and ______ county. This got his attention and says, who? I repeat this time pronouncing his full name. I see that he's thinking pretty hard and then says no. I say that's odd considering you go to the same briefings and your boss is ______. 


At this point my girl calls, wondering why I'm not home yet with our lunch. I ask if I can answer, but the bitch is back in the car and says no but I will. So she picks up the phone, says who she is and I'm going to jail for possession. 


At this point my phone is unlocked, she starts to look at my call history and text messages. Notcies some texts stating id be willing to get rid of 5 of my 2mg bars or 10 of my 10mg valuims (which I both legally own scripts for). So she say then states you know we can get you kicked off your benzos immediately. I begged her not to and I was only trying to do so for food and has money for my girl to have the gas to get to work till payday.


This is where things is odd, now I'm in full on WD, pissed I didn't just wait till I got home and locked my bathroom door. But the man states that there is a problem and then says a word I couldn't make out. 


Then she says well today is your lucky day, and proceeds to take me out of the car and takes the cuffs off. I the, sign a paper stating this all basically happened. The make tells me in a out a month after the results of the substance comes back they are most likely you going to issue me a warrant. 


Off they go, so I rolled back to my dboys house and park in his garage and shut the door so not to be seen. 


I inform him everything and he tells me the guy next door is slinging an has cars in and out constantly. This has to be where they believe I came from and makes sense as to why I was a liar. Before leaving I proceed to ask for just a bump for the ride home since I'm sick and I just 6have him the last of my cash. ""Naw sorry nigga I'm out, if I had it I would"". 


Coming from a dude who used to front me grams I found this hard to believe and just said oh yeah? Then left. 


Hit up my dboy from my town and explain to him, he hooks me up with a small front and I was able to be functioning long enough to go home to an intervention. Since everyone thought I was I jail.


My question is how often do people get let go and since I didn't know my new address to my apartment they didn't have my residency. However they have my number, but what the fuck happened?


In now on suboxone treatment and hoping if I have to go to court that it will be not so bad. It was a misdemeanor consdering the weight. But they never searched me, read my rights. Went threw my phone. And then just left.



What should I be expect?
 


Tldr: Relapsed for the second time, and was formally introduced to the task force, they did some shady practices and after mentioning knowing their boss and a,other fellow task force officer who I play poker with was just let go and told it was my lucky day and to expect to hear back from them in a month possibly. Next day went to a suboxone clinic and now clean again. Anyone have experience in this and if so how did it play out?",1478501296.0

Anyways fk the black soot that transfers from foil to god knows everything else. The days I'm wearing khakis and dosing in the bathroom and can't put my gear back my pants with out black smudges transferring onto my clothes. 

God forbid if I'm wearing a bright color shirt (thank god I live in the PNW and colors don't really exist)
But I can't count the amount of times Ive transferred black onto some fresh washed clothes or even worse when my face that itches. Scratch that shit and not even realize now my face has faint black marks that look like bruises. Getting hit up at work,""dude did you get punched in the face, you got a black spot under your eye."" 
Walking up and down steps or turning on a light switch and the railings have black smudges along with the light switches. 

Heck just having it on your hands is hard enough to get by looking like you haven't washed yours hands in 2 weeks (btw I don't look like a mechanic, I work tech so that never works)  

Just my shit rant for the day, struggles of a smoker and the fact it gave away a 8year habit of opioids to my parents because the once a year I visited them I transferred a single black finger smudge to a paper towel roll after a late night fridge raid. 
To all you who think I have bad hygiene or am dirty do not have an ROA of chasing the dragon. I did use to fold corners of the foil to have a gripping spot but that does not always work. This is mainly a shit post but would love to hear some suggestions as well. Heck I even know my bangers out there have had the same issue with the soot on cookers 

PS the worst is scratching your balls after taking a hit and the transfer getting on your light color underwear or sheets. Makes the lady's really wet.....luckily my lobido is completly gone unless they come to me.

Anyone here playing Civ VI? I bought it this Friday after saving some money from my last pay-day. Got sick of going to the drug and alcohol rehabilitation place, so fell off my buprenorphine script and got me some poppy seeds :D Not the best move, but subs are cheap on the darknet. I bought some already, and plan to use them to taper down and off for good after finishing off my seeds. Hopefully Civ will keep me distracted from the discomfort!

I'll probably make another thread to ask this, but is it a good idea to go for as long as I can stand withdrawals, then take a dose of buprenorphine, then repeat this while lowering the dose each time? It'd drag out a bit, but I did this with SSRI withdrawal and it worked in the end.

Anyway, Civilization! I'm enjoying Civ VI a lot, so I'm hoping it'll help with the discomfort I feel as I lower my dosage :) I've played a lot of Civ V this past opiated year. It's the perfect game for opiate users really, being turn based nothing bad happens if you nod out for 20 minutes, just pick it back up when you come back to reality. Plus you can easily watch netflix or youtube in the background.

I really don't know where else to ask regarding syringes as it has been a long while since I've bought them.

Never got around to doing so, and it's been over a year since I've even touched the whole thing. But to have syringes just lying around like that would probably make it hard when someone finds out about it and ask me to explain myself. So even though I have not been caught because nobody even bothers to look around my stuff in the household (maybe I have and nobody cared or was too afraid to mention it), I'd rather not be in that situation where I'd have to.

Of course, I could tell them I had no intention to use them for opiates or anything like that, but nobody's gonna believe me. They're syringes for fucks sake.

A little back story: This past summer I broke my right shoulder and the doctors first put me on hydro and then morphine. They gave me a -er- fairly hefty script. This went on for almost a year -up until the government decided to crack down on opiates. My doctor cut me off and I was basically left to CT on my own. Let me tell you that it was the worst few hours of my life (I can't even imagine how some people go through that shit for a week!), as you all probably now how terrible an opiate WD is. Desperately searching through the medicine cabinet, I found an old bottle of clonazepam. It was 1 mg's. Throughout the 3 days of opiate WD I took 27 mg of that shit (9 mg per day) and let me tell you: I didn't feel a SINGLE WD symptom. No anxiety, no soul-crushing depression, no aches and pains, no shits, no pukes. Hell, I didn't even get a runny nose! Obviously 9 mg clonazepam/day would fuck most people up, but I was fairly sober throughout the ordeal, which I think is because the opiate WD's were so severe that all clonazepam did was to make me feel normal.

Has anyone experienced this? I literally had no WD symptoms, and mind you: By the time my doctor cut off my script I was using up to 300 mg of morphine. So I was expecting some gnarly withdrawals, but luckily nothing happened.

It's been three and a half days since my last dose, and through the entire time I binged on clonazepam (I know benzos are addictive too, but three days probably wouldn't be enough to get me addicted). 

So, my question: Do benzos mask opiate withdrawals? I understand helping with anxiety and RLS, but literally every other symptom had disappeared too. How's this possible?

Or, another theory -one that dreads me to think about-, is that the WD's didn't begin yet because of the immense amounts of morphine I had in my system and it built up, and the WD's will begin in a day or too. But even with a very long-acting opiate like methadone (way longer half-life than morphine) you see WD symptoms in 2-3 days.

So, do you think it was the ungodly amounts of clonazepam that I used within the last 3 1/2 days, or did the WD's simply didn't start yet due to the morphine not being cleared from my system?",1478464026.0

Edit:  Thanks everyone, I've decided against it and I'm going to buy some bud instead to distract myself.  Your posts made me realize that I'm not yet at the point in my addiction that my post suggested I was at and I do not want to get there.  I'm sure you can all understand though: sometimes when we're feeling ""off"" (not even in WDs rn), not sure what the cause is, and have extra money in our pocket and that number in our phone it's so tempting to just make the phone call and feel amazing within an hour.  

But then, you wake up the next morning groggy and only thinking about one thing.  Over the course of a few days, the initial craving that I'm feeling now will become an insatiable thirst that will continue until my stash runs dry.  Then, I'll feel terrible, depressed, and unproductive for a week telling myself never again and maybe take some benzos - ""just until I feel better from opiate WDs"".  And then I'll have to stop taking the benzos, I'll eventually feel better, and be in the position I'm in now again.  That's the BEST case scenario outcome for me if I cop tonight, so I've decided against it. 

Again, thanks for the tough love guys haha and I wish you all the best with whatever you're struggling with rn!

Cant find the original but it was about a guy getting burned and going to the hospital and not getting enough meds.   
  I recently broke my back and was in a a very similar situation.  I literally screamed in pain for 24 hours straight before the surgery.  After about 3 hours of screaming in pain i finally told them i had a very big habit and they gave my morph, dil, ketamine and fent.  Still nothing touched the pain.  THe pain got much better after the surgery and they put me on a dil pump which gave .8mgs every 15 mins which kept me from screaming but still not comfortable.  I guess all im saying is that having a high tolerance sucks when something catastrophic happens so just keep that in mind.  Not preaching, just saying.

So my fiance and I have been going through the same dude for some time now. We're moderate users, pretty consistent with the amount we buy, and our good buddy middle mans for us. 


The stuff is pretty consistent in quality and quantity. Our dboy used to be fairly stingy with the amount he'd give us until we mentioned it to our middle man, and since then, everything's either been on point, or even a little extra from time to time... :-O Pretty awesome, right?


For the record, none of us shoot, we all snort. My fiance and I have been doing dope for about six months consistently now, so our tolerance is pretty high. This will be relevant to know I think. 


So for the past few weeks, things have been a little, well... odd. We had bought half a gram one day after getting paid, and my fiance and I split a line that was about 20 dollars worth. Almost immediately he starts to nod off. I mean, I felt pretty high too, but nothing like what he was acting like. I asked him if he was feeling okay, because his eyes were fluttering, he was snoring, falling over, etc. And he couldn't even respond to me. I'm pretty sure he was almost out cold, I had never seen him like that before in my life. I was terrified, because recently someone close to us OD'd and almost died from it, so I was understandably shaken up. I started shaking him, shouting his name, trying anything to get him snap out of it. I was about two minutes away from dragging his half lifeless body into my car and getting him to an ER when he finally snapped out of it enough to become somewhat coherent. He told me that he had zero clue that I had done any of the following trying to get him to wake up, and he was, well, fine after he had finally woken up. 


So, since then I have spoken with our middle, trying to figure out what crazy cutter our dboy has decided to use. He told me that he's experienced similar sensations, including pretty much sleepwalking during a walk down the street after doing a line similar to what we had split. And frankly, that fucking terrifies me. This isn't a one time event, reddit, this has happened multiple times after that day a couple weeks ago, and has escalated to the point where my fiance will even throw up after finally snapping out of his weird, trance like state. And, sure, it does make me nod off a little bit, but nothing to the degree that it effects him. It's almost like in addition to the dope, he decided to take a handful of benzos. And the weirdest thing is, this stuff doesn't taste like dope at all... In fact, it's almost flavorless. 


The dboy is mum whenever questioned about what it's cut with, and the shitty thing is is that after the main dealer in town got locked up, he's the only one that sells anything worth money. Everyone else sells complete garbage that is either entirely fake, or has so little real shit in it that it will barely keep you off from being sick. I'm so fucking glad that we don't shoot, or I'm pretty sure this stuff would have killed the love of my life the first time we had tried it. 


Do any of you have any clue as to what the hell this stuff is cut with? I'm at a complete loss, because it's just weird how it affects him. I'd appreciate any help or suggestions, thank you so much. We're currently waiting on a big order of subs to come in so we can quit this stuff for good, but until then, we can't risk being sick because we both work full time at high stress, busy jobs that require us to be on our feet constantly. Right now, he's currently nodding in and out, and I'm keeping a good eye on him right now, but frankly I'm pretty sick and tired of being constantly worried that something isn't totally right about what we're buying. I love this guy, and if anything happened to him, I don't know what I'd do. :( Thanks for reading, have a great night or morning wherever you are, and stay safe guys. <3",1478585238.0

So here is question for you...as time moves forward and you have kids and they have kids. Then one day your grand kid ask you what you did back in the day what do you tell them?

Also when do you get to old todo dope? Drugs in general like 70+? lol

Will you tell your kids and your grand kids what you have done? 

I would like to believe that some day everything just stops. Poof no more opiates..

Like I like to think my drug use as a immaturity, and that I'm emotionally not developed and mask my fears and emotions with drugs. Is it a path of finding ones self is why we use? I just ""like"" to think one day why we look back at all our post while we are in our 80s how silly it was abusing our selfs and chasing drugs, for what self exploration and or something, obviously we are wired different, than average homosapiens. You can shoot a man up with dope everyday in a lab but the really question after WDs will he go looking for dope? In his town? Does opiate addiction happen in every single living person who taste it, or is it possible it mentally alters the structure of your head to constantly want it. Or my opinion people with certain ""genetics"" and Neuro chemical make up (ADHD, traumatic events, etc. ""Smarter"" gifted folks) are more likely to abuse drugs.

Anyway food for thought post your thoughts

My only real experience with opiates are the ones I've been prescribed, I've been on codeine and tramadol before, and very much enjoy the codeine high, far more so than the tramadol buzz. 

I'm far from opiate-naive in the sense I've been scripted 240mg codeine a day for the last 8 years, and tramadol 400mg a day for about 3 years. I've also used dihydrocodeine but had an allergic reaction both times to it, so... fuck that haha. Recreationally, I usually take about 600-700mg codeine and 600mg tramadol, though I don't combine the two. 

I am also prescribed 20mg diazepam a day and 2mg lorazepam a day. I've been on these for about 4 years now. 

My favourite combination is 600mg codeine, 40mg diazepam and 2mg lorazepam. Best feeling ever!

I've recently come across the opportunity to pick up some Percocet 512s and some genuine Purdue OxyContin 20s (the OCs not the OPs - in my part of the world they still manufacture the OC formula). I also have a hookup for Pfizer 2mg Xanax and I'm looking to have the best possible time.

Now I'm on a bit of a limited budget, but I do love xannys so they're an in, but in terms of the choice between the Percocet or the OC 20s, which would you choose? The same price will get me 100 5/325s Percocet 512s or 22 OxyContin OC 20s.

What would you choose, and why? I've never tried either of these, and I know the active ingredient in them is both oxycodone, but people say there are differences and such, plus, which would give me better bang for my buck?

I'm a chipper--low-dose subs all month, 3-5 consecutive days plugging ~4gs of BTH (while my kids are away), as well as 1 fent patch every two weeks. Feel free to ask me anything--nothing is off limits but I cant promise I'll answer things that have the potential to identify me.

It's hard to find heroin that'll 'break through' and get me high, and even then, I hate having to spend so much for a single high. 

So basically I'm looking for an opioid analog that's relatively euphoric, has a good nod, decent legs (duration), and is relatively safe to administer. 

So far, my ideas are FuranylFentanyl cut with mannitol, and U47700. (Is U47700 available on clearnet? I'd prefer to be able to get these via the clearnet if possible, to prevent me from having to get bitcoins and all that hassle lol. But if some really good opiate analogs are available on dnms then I might be inclined to check em out.)

I was thinking -fent types, since they seem like they'd have the best success with breaking thru my 'done and giving me a nice nod (even just mixing my kpins with my 'done won't give me a nod and hasn't in years for some reason). A nice euphoric rush with hopefully some residual euphoria that isn't too sucky (ik fent isn't the most euphoric ofc), so I could always smoke a sativa strain of weed to provide the euphoria or something lol. 

Anyway I appreciate your suggestions. Thanks so much everyone. Be safe! Happy nods",1478700571.0

I can get through the acute withdrawals but I always end up relapsing.

I've suffered from depression for quite a few years now, and its only gotten worse.  I have no doubt that my abuse of opiates has been a big part, if not the sole cause of my mildish depression turning into, according to my doc, ""severe depression"".  I dont get out of bed if I don't work, I've completely socially isolated myself etc.  Only person I talk to is my mom.  

Anyways, I used to have a 2G a day U4 habit, snorted.  So I think give or take around the equivalent of a 4G a day H habit. 

I quit that cold turkey, obviously very brutal.  I was clean for 3 months, and was doing SO SO much better. My cravings were very managable.  No longer were they taking up all my mental strength and willpower.  They were merely passing thoughts. Then I decided I could use casually again (ya right).  I bought 2 pts of H and the day after I had knew I fucked up bad because I literally could not stop thinking about H/opiates.

Well, ever since then I've struggled to get clean and my depression has progressively gotten worse, and I know my opiate abuse is making my depression 10x worse.  My longest clean streak was around 1 month and 3 weeks (so 7 weeks), after getting arrested.  Thats a whole 'nother story but lets just say being dope sick in jail sucks even more than being dope sick on the outside! Still nothing compared to kicking a 2G U4 habit cold turkey...

Anyways, today I've finally accepted defeat... I can't get clean on my own will.  I'll literally go through withdrawals and as soon as my physical withdrawals are abating I'll go and do more H.  Its like I torture myself on purpose lol...  Well atleast the good part of this is that cause of this my tolerance remains fairly low since I'm constantly getting sick/well.

So I'm gettings on subs - but I plan to do it only as a temporary measure. 3-6 months tops hopefully.  I know I'm staying on them for atleast 3 months cause thats what it took for my cravings to truly get manageable.  I know I'll still have cravings when I finally taper off sub but I feel they'll be more managable with bupe (sub) being a partial agonist and all.  As for the cravings I'll have while on sub, should I relapse, nothing should happen since bupe has a much higher binding affinity than most (all?) opiates.

Since I'm basically using subs as a tool to stay clean, I plan to use a very small dose.   For some reason in Canada we dont have strips and only 8mg pills I believe which is insane! My plan is to, once I'm in w/ds ofc, take an 8mg pill and crush it up into powder and then using a mg scale, divide it into 16 piles (so .5mg per pile).  Then I plan to dose .5mg at a time until I feel well... not sick I suppose...

My plan then is over atleast 3 months and hopefully (but not necessarily) no more than 6 months taper whatever my dose is to 0.  By then I will hopefully have more control over my currently uncontrollable cravings like I did when I was clean 3 months off U4.  Also, over those months on subs I plan to work on my depression which I know is made exponentially worse by my opiate use (but fuck does it sure help short term!).  I know I will have cravings coming off subs and probably depression but I'm hoping it'll be manageable compared to coming off H cold turkey which so far has led to relapse everytime...

Wells thats about it I guess... my question is does it seem reasonable/doable?  Any suggestions or tips?  Personal stories?

Also, for people on sub/bupe how do you find your sex drive affected?  Personally for opiates they ENTIRELY kill my sex drive.  Completely.  At one point during my U4 addiction I went over 3 months without busting a nut, and it literally hurt when I finally did.

Well thats about it!  All and any input appreciated! 

Very truly yours,
Wanna_take_a_dump

edit: I should mention my Dr is away till Monday so I am enjoying hopefully my final days on H till then.  I plan to take my last hoot/dragon/smoke of H Saturday night and begin suboxone Monday evening/night.

Like, if the middle of nowhere were a city I wouldn't even live in a suburb of Middle of Nowhere City, I'd live in one of those farming communities outside of the hypothetical suburb. Hell, even that's not true; those suburbs have things like stop lights and businesses. Instead I'd live five or six miles down a series of dirt roads that dead end into random fields where even the cows standing in them look lost.

Shit, I *do* live down miles of dirt roads that dead end into fields full of sad, lost-looking cattle.

Now, couple that sad state of existence with the fact that heroin is mostly unheard of in my area in the best of times and you end up with the perfect place where, if you look really, *really* hard, you'll be lucky to find insanely overpriced pills *(""Why yes, Mr. Drug Dealer Man, I do happen to think a buck-plus per milligram for morphine is too much, you cum-gargling fuck-spigot."")* but virtually no heroin.

Now, never let it be said that FLJ let living in the exact geographic center of Nothing stop him from being the very best drug addict he could be. And as the very best drug addict I could be I've scrounged together quite the motley collection of doctors with liberal prescription pads, pain management patients with more pills than owies, and price-gouging assclown dealers. But, alas, none of the above could supply me with a regular source of my one true love, Lady Heroin. Pills of every shape, color, and dosage, yes, but if I wanted any of that beautifully acetic-smelling powder my go-to connect was the mailman.

At least until a few days ago, that is. I won't bore you the specifics of how we were introduced, but let it be said that I'm incredibly happy to have met this fine, upstanding example of American entrepreneurial ambition. And while I'm not going to pay $30 a point often, I will say that for tonight I was happy to part with fifty bucks for a scant two hundred milligrams of off-white powder.

And yes, my dear, dear friends - I did just waste about five hundred words and spend thirty minutes typing out a shit post that basically boils down to, *""I just bought some dope. Yay for me,""* but I'm high and needed to do something while waiting for the first polls to close. So, I suppose, mission accomplished, and now it's time to watch election night unfold.

Shit has been cut to the point of it being hella strong. I had half a dozen people on the block I grab at warn me that today 3 people have OD'd from it while on the block/in someone's house. No idea how many OD'd off said spot. Pretty sure its fent cut, but not 100% positive. 

I usually do 1/2 a bag with 25 units of water. After being warned, I decided that I rather be safe than sorry and I can always do more if I didnt get the high I wanted. So I did 1/6 of the bag with 40 units of water, then last moment added another 10 units. If I wasn't sitting down, I would have fallen flat on my ass. So yea.

If you're curious as to what stamp it is or what part of the city it is (I won't give out the exact location, sorry), PM me. I know the rules on the sidebar say no location-specific posts including cities, but 3 known ODs from just one block is enough reason for me to write this post.

Stay safe and much love to yall.

I dont know why I can't stop shooting heroin. It's so fucked up, I just got out of rehab about 2 weeks ago. I'm in IOP. I'm also on 5 years probation with random drug tests and all that bullshit. But the day I got out of rehab I didn't go visit anyone, I didn't tell anyone I was back, I went straight to my dope dealer and shot up in a dirty bathroom. I didn't tell anyone so if I died people would just think I'm still gone. Mind you I'm only 19 years old yet I have a vicious drug addiction. I'm not going too bore you with all the details of my shitty  life. But when I got out on probation I had no problem quitting everything else I was on and heavily addicted to, alcohol  (drank everyday til I threw up and drank again), pot, xanax (even had seizures from the withdrawal), crack. No problem giving those up. But dope for some fucking reason I can't, I'm willing to go to jail,  fail drug tests,  everyone finding out I relapsed, doing all the horrible things I did to get dope, rehab, i just don't care, I just want a needle in my arm. Last thing, 2 nights ago I got some dope, shot a bag fell out, woke up shot another and fell out, as soon as I woke up saod fuck I'm not high ignoring the fact I couldve died, shot up again and the same thing happened,  that process happened about 6 times that night. I don't know why it didn't scare me and I don't know why I can't fucking stop.

I quit a 100-200 mg a day five year habit over the winter. Jan 2 was my first clean day in five years (only ran out once for more the a day). I used a quick oxy taper then a quick sub taper with lots of xanax. It worked well W/D wasn't too bad. Of course the xanax stayed around for a few months after but I was able to tough that one out cold turkey (sucked balls)

Anyway I was clean Jan - april. My mom was diagnosed with late stage cancer and the outlook looked very very bleak. I started popping xanax right away but stayed away from opiates on principle , even with them laying all over her house now. Mom died mid august and it has been very hard, even with chemical comfort. She died with a practically full script of green 15s, 111 to be exact and about 50 green 30mg extended. 

I couldn't help myself and snatched them up using the excuse that they'll be good for when my back flares up. I have occasional bulging discs. My family never knew of my addiction and ive never been in trouble have a degree and am married, a total normy though everyone knows I like to smoke some good nug at the right time. They didn't look at me twice for taking them.

Fast forward 3 months and ive been using every day with a little xanax thrown in for good measure. Called up my old guys when moms stuff ran out. They were all to happy to have me back the 80s and blues started flowing. Im in some minor legal trouble and i love drugs but am not happy about being dependent on them again, fuck that. So im quitting for a second time. No choice but cold turkey this time but the habit was as big or as long so ill be ok. Sorry for the long ass post im just at hour 30 and needed to talk.

By InhalingHappiness

Lookin down out at lines of black snakes

Wonderin,thinkin about all the mistakes

I have made in this short life of mine

Sinkin, suffocating, in the sands of time

Inhaling fumes that'll make me content

With all the memories i'm trying to forget

As the clock ticks and tocks

Its only a matter of time before my body is outlined in chalk

When I take my last breath

Seconds before my death

I just hope its not filled with regret

With all the things, I would've,could've, and shouldve done
If I hadn't decided to go on the run

From these emotions from deep within

Only to be known once I stop breathin

So just hand me a paper and pen

And i'll write about where i've been

Its only a matter of time before I sin again

Im losing my mental stability

I just wanna find my place of tranquility

A place where I can be me

Not what all these fake people want me to be

Why is it so hard for people to see

No matter what becomes of me

We all still come from the same genetic family

With another hit I numb the pain

My brain seems to change in a positive way

Keepin negative thoughts at bay

As my momma prays to God to let her son live to see another day

Even though she couldn't make me stay

I had to learn to make my own way

It's wearing off fast

I gotta hustle to make that cash

To cop another sack to add to my stash ya better know it won't last

Soon enough i'm fiendin

Forgettin what I used to believe in

Exhaling those fumes along with all my feelins

At what cost is another life tossed away,left to decay

Lost, wasted and thrown in the gutter to rot away all in the light of

day, oh bitter sweet ironay.

A war on drugs imposed to imprison the victims of their own addictions

Made into criminals by a flawed system

Cant make this up, it isn't fiction

One day I just may come to find

That I have lost my mind

An' end up doin time for a crime I commited to get out of a bind

Once kind, turned glossy eyed,mind fried, friends and family left behind

The vinegary smell became commonplace, embraced by many who

enjoyed the sour taste

followed by the chase of the rush

when freebased.

Got my dopamine receptors

workin to their extent

To release a sense of pleasure

with only 20 dollars spent

Money ment for rent that is used to support a habit that only ends

with death

Got zero dollars left, wonderin where it went

The poverty that society has pushed people in

Forces the good to sin in order to provide children with food in their

own kitchen

Things wont change, they'll stay the same,I only have myself to

blame

Would you trade everything for riches and fame

Even then it won't rid the pain that circulates through my brain

That I feel when I dont have what I need flowing through these veins

Starts at my brain, then my body reacts

After that first hit, I feel fully intact

A full dose of smack right on impact

is what my body lacked

Nothing left but black lines on foil

All that time inhaling as it comes to a boil

Bubbling away lifting up into smoke

Replacing my money, leavin me broke

But that doesnt matter in a world of bliss

When something so little can give me whatever I wish

Turning bad feelins to good no matter the case, it doesnt care about

gender, race or if you like to IV or freebase

A life defined by how many thin black lines created at any given time

makes it fine to commit any crime worth the time

Until nothings left but a needle in my arm that's turning green

Still chasin that dragon,because that's not close to then worse that

i've seen.",1478632984.0

My pills ran out because I have a period that lasts for ten days and feels like hell between my legs. My doctor refused to see me last week because I was a few m inured late for my appointment. Never mind that I drive sixty miles and enter rush hour traffic in a Friday to go to the appointment. I returned home. I ran out of pills as of Sunday morning. I am getting by on gabapentin and have an appointment tomorrow. I explained to them I am out. They refused a prescription bridge to cover me. They know I will be in withdrawal . 

I've been an addict for several years. Never had a problem with pills after several surgeries until I had a car accident and was prescribed Vicodin and soma. The soma made it feel magical and that dr knew he was putting a trap on me. He offers private back rubs via email and phone calls. He was prescribing me drugs knowing I would come back and be hooked on the mix. I was. I found a pain clinic instead. 

So here I am. A legit pain clinic patient. I'm approaching withdrawals.  I have no friends here. No family. Just myself. And it sucks.  Feeling alone and feeling like hell for the last two weeks now between my period and being out of pills. Holding off withdrawal with gabapentin. Feeling like a dirtbag for being out and being an addict. I have no one in this to help me even with kind words. Just myself and i am fucked.

What do I tell my doctor tomorrow? 
Should I use this brake to try quitting the 40mg of perc I have been on for years now? 
What else can I do for these symptoms?

Music runs in my family, and ive noticed this effect in the past while using, like I cant connect with the music, or any emotion really. Ive been numb too long.

Now as an adult i can't stay concentrated while studying so i got my doctor to prescribe me some ritalin a long time ago. I got 30 x 20mgs. I'm writing this while crushing a ritalin and snorting it bit by bit. Right now im reading a book while high on ritz about prescription drug addiction to get me through tramadol withdrawal and recovery(i will try very hard this time). 

I took my last pills so i had 500mgs or 600mgs XR tramadol yesterday. I was starting to feel sick today and tomorrow the WDs will really start. 

I found out a couple months ago that when i snorted ritalin while im sick. I get a bit better. Does anyone of you feel the same thing (maybe not with ritalin but any ADHD meds)? I have an appointments with my Doctor tomorrow and i would like to change ritalin for Adderal or Vyvanse. ( What are your opinions on both drugs ? ) Should i ask for changing ritalin because i find it weak (i take my pills orally when studying) ? I guess i should ask but i'm not sure what to tell him if he will no give me what i want. Any ideas ?

I Started out taking 15-20mg of Vicodin, for a legit foot injury. 
I then ended up craving the buzz and started buying oxycodone and percocet from local dealers. Ive taken at max 32 mg throughout a 6-12 hour day. Mostly oxy snorted. I can easily go with 10mg of oxy on days i work without too much problems.
 Now here i sit, feeling low and unwilling to spend much more on these pills. I was planning on doing a taper, going from what i take now (Roughly 20-30mg) to 10-15mg for a few days, maybe 4 days. Then hope to use the remaining vicodin i have left and work my way down to 2.5mg maybe even 1.25 and then jump off. I have about 28 5mg vic left, and can get access to oxy pretty easily. 
I really want to complete this whole taper process within 2-3 weeks tops. ANY suggestions, Previous Experience Stories would be GREATLY appreciated. The thing that sucks is i do have a pretty large amount of legit pain (Fractured compression joint and 3 disc protrusions in my lower lumbar).
 I will be seeing a chiropractor in a week or 2. I am also willing to go to NA meetings if cravings become a problem. These pills even in the amount of 2mg snorted give me great energy, focus and ability to work my very physically demanding job. They also help incredibly with anxiety and motivation(Through increased confidence)

To say I regret this is mad, to say I'm happy. That's just right. The sun coming up is bliss. And the nature around me makes me look at the rat race, like a form of slavery.

Heroin is an amazing thing, and so is life accompanied by it. If you love something, work for it, and one day, it will serve you.

So, I've been sober for quite a while now and I decided to get my rocks off somehow. I contacted escorts off backpage because I was particularly horny and wanted to get my rocks off NOW and I contacted an escort off craigslist. Usually in the past I have had a lot of trouble getting escorts to call or text me back, it happened but then by the time they responded I wasn't interested anymore for... erm, various reasons. But this one responded so I was like fuck it. Her post didn't have a face pic and her body seemed okay so I was like hmm... maybe she doesn't want to get caught by LEO or something. Okay. So I ask for a face pic and it's super dark, it's not the best pic in the world, she looks sad and looking off screen, I'm like hmm, okay, she looks alright I guess for just a fuck, looks kinda young. Asked if she was 18 said she was 26. Was probably a really old pic in hindsight. So I shower and go to meet up with her, and it's still kinda dark out but shes not looking good, even though I didn't look at her face much. The darkness helped A LOT. She had a really innocent, cute, bubbly voice over the phone so I was like, cool, maybe I'll get a chick that hasn't been around so I won't get STDs or nuthin. This whole time I'm debating what I'm doing and that it's not ethical and maybe I will just not go through with it and talk to her in case she wants a way out and maybe help her. I was like I'll let the universe decide what happens and that this will be a one time thing. As I follow her inside after meeting her shes wearing tramped out clothes (high heels, etc. obviously a street hooker) and her back is absolutely covered with acne spots and splotches. Anyway We're in the bedroom, and theres this extremely bright white light in an extremely trapped out room that reveals the horror. She looked like a straight up troll. I made some excuse about it being my first time and that I changed my mind. The apartment was so fucking tiny and trapped out it really did not set the mood either. I like classy, intelligent women. She makes a beeline for the door and I was just sitting on the bed seeing where this was going thinking shes gonna try to convince me into it, and starts demanding I pay her, grabbing me by the collar and blocking the door. She keeps saying shes gonna get HER MAN to come get me if I don't pay her and I'm disrespectful and this and that (didn't say 1 negative thing to her) going absolutely nuts and I'm just like What is wrong with you I was here for 2 seconds I'm not paying you. I'm like ok get your man and I'll give him tree fitty. Shes pretty small and I used enough force just to get her to move from the door. She keeps screaming on and on telling me her man is going to come find me and yada yada yada. I'm like ok go get your man cya later I'm not paying you, get out of my way. As I'm walking out after being trapped in this trapped out building, first of all, I can't find the stairwell and I hear the most gutteral, deep, earthshattering scream that reverberated off the walls and it was like a demon just got summoned from hell. I'm surprised no neighbors came out or if theyre used to it. So I make it outside and I can't find where I parked! Fucking nightmare! I'm walking but I start running down alleys n shit in case I'm being followed, going back and forth down the block walking again to not be conspicuous and think my car mightve got stolen. I'm pretty sure there was a girl following me cuz she was starting at me and talking on the phone and I just stopped and stared at her until she walked away. I realized I dropped my soda and ran back to get it. By pure dumb luck I eventually found my car by trying to evade the girl trying to follow me on a main street in case I got jumped. I look back at my phone and I see texts like ""Faggot ass punk as bitch"" etc. and ""We got your liscense plate we're gonna find you"". A) I don't think she could find me with a liscense plate and B) I didn't even get a plate yet because my car is brand new. This girl was fucking terrifyingly possessed like nothing else its hard to describe, like is this shit real. I really felt bad for her actually and wanted to say something nice to her wishing her well but decided against it because I figured that it would just add fuel to the fire. I thought about how she mustve been bullied and all the steps in her life that took her to where she is. I took a huge sigh of relief in my car and took side streets home in case I was being followed and it was all good. I sat in my car for like 30 mn afterwards listening to oldschool rap, high off adrenaline and coming down like did this really just happen. I think part of me was hoping she'd lead me back to drugs cuz I was gonna ask if she did dope. It was fucked up but that was the most excitement I got in a while, the threat of fear on my life was more exhilarating than sex. I think hookers would do a lot better if they didn't dress like hookers for various reasons(LEO for one) but thats just my 2c. We need hookers for the modern age who are just sexy girls who are intelligent, can hold a conversation, dress casually but sexy as well, well-mannered, good at cuddling, maybe have netflix if theres spare time. She didnt want to do outcalls which was a huge redflag too. Anyway that's the story of a new low I reached in sobriety.

TLDR; Went to get escort, ho trapped me, got away, presumably sent someone after me, lost car, escaped.",1478877399.0

I'm stopping tomorrow. (lol as we all tell ourselves) Doing my last big shot tonight. And because I've been doing big shots (5-10 baggers), without a doubt, I will get an allergic reaction. Even if I take zertec beforehand. They are getting ridiculous. 3 days ago I almost went to the hospital because I've never had a reaction where it spread to my face, visiabally, and blotches where my throat was swelling up. I usually get really warm, my temperature rises, skin hot, face hot, ears red hot. I was scared as fuck but luckily a friend was there and kept me calm. It happened again at school yesterday AND even today. Should I be worried? This is what it looks like:

question #1:
>i'm doing big shots of dope and im breaking out in reallly extreme hives. Is this something to be worries or its just like any other allergic reaction... 

My left eye is a -2.5 and my right eye is -1.5. I wear glasses and contacts sometimes. never in my life had this problem till i started shooting up. i think it began with the coke, speedballs, etc. I would o so much where my vision is SOOO blurred and twisted, cant see straight with or without glasses, i'd be covering an eye to try to see. shit like that. I was doing crazy binges where this was a common occurance for a month. between then and now (8 months ago) mainly, my left eye, would get ""lazy"". it drifts to the side towards my ear. it happens with my contacts/glasses and even MORE often without. I wake up and its an issue, where i'm only seeing out of ONE eye. 


So shooting coke fucked up my brain wiring somehow where it relies on my right eye more than my left. at times ( which is more common when im not wearing vision correcting things) my brain pretty much ignores whatever im seeing in my left, since it's a little bit blurry, and just uses my right, therefore my lefteye just wanders around. i can correct it by looking at a mirror and adjusting it but sometimes that doesnt even work.

question #2: how do i possibly fix my eyes so they're working in unison, together, as a whole rather than separate entities? I'm not sure if it's a muscle issue, that my left side is more lazy, or its my brain thats just fucked from all the cokeshots... ",1478841557.0

Buy online, it's easier and cheaper. I wrote this up to help people get fresh supplies and to share some important IV safety info. I've done my research and made a list with links and prices. Please consider getting the full safety combo! I explain why in detail below.
(TLDR: affordable filters will protect you from serious lung damage that's caused by cuts or pill filler that won't dissolve.)

All the supplies are from Allegro Medical because they have good prices and don't require a prescription. I've used them before. They're having a $1 shipping deal through Friday for any order, promo code NOV99. All the needles are Monoject brand because they're high quality at the lowest cost. Stock up on this stuff and you'll never have to re-use a rig.

Option #1: Plain old 1mL syringes.

[Box of 100 Monoject 1mL 28 gauge insulin syringes - $10](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/monoject-insulin-syringe-1cc-28g-1-2-p539358.html). A hundred rigs delivered for $11, that's as cheap as it gets. 

I **highly** recommend getting the whole kit; it's well worth it and you'll thank yourself later.

Option #2: IV safety combo, 100 of everything you need for under $60

[100 generic 3mL syringes - $11](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/syringe-only-3cc-22g-p560294.html)

[100 Monoject 27 gauge 1/2 inch hypodermic needles - $12](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/hypo-needle-intmd-27g-x-1-2-yellow-p548836.html). Other gauges are available too.

[100 Monoject 5 micron filter needles - $30](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/filter-needle-18g-x-1-5-green-p548901.html)

While you're at it, you can get a [sharps container](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/phlebotomy-sharps-containers-p574327.html) and a [case of alcohol wipes](http://www.allegromedical.com/syringes-c570/curity-alcohol-prep-pads-p191884.html) for $2 each.

I should also point out that using bacteriostatic water is always a smart idea. 

The filter needles are the key component of safer IV practices. Particles from cuts (and *especially* pill fillers) that don't dissolve will *seriously* fuck up your lungs. Particles smaller than you can see will get caught in the tiny capillaries in your lungs and clog them permanently. It's called pulmonary talcosis and it's some scary shit, look it up. It leads to various lung problems down the line. 

**Cotton does not protect you from these particles!** Studies say that particles as small as 9 microns are the cause; these filters block anything larger than 5 microns, which should be sufficient protection. It's well worth the small additional expense. 


Basic instructions:

- Dissolve your stuff like normal and drop a cotton bud in there.
- Attach the filter needle to the syringe
- Draw up the liquid through the cotton, it will help prevent the filter from clogging.
- Remove the filter needle and attach the hypodermic needle.
- Wipe your skin with alcohol then inject
- Enjoy your high knowing that your lungs aren't withering away

If you want to be more economical about using the filters, you could filter several shots worth and save some for later using bacteriostatic water.

Local hostels are $2/night. Restaurants have special ""happy"" menus where you can order joints already rolled and grams of opium with a pipe that they will tend for you and it's dirt cheap. They love Americans and won't try to kill or kidnap us for ransom like Afghanis or Pakistanis would in their heroin producing regions. The most expensive part is the plane ticket there and back.

when i went to take a test shot the tar dissolved into a clear/yellow liquid when drawn up into the syringe.

 I still shot it and it was defintally an opiate, it got me a good rush off of just soaking the piece of tar for about 2 minutes when the liquid was yellow.

There is a stomach bug going around work so I didn't know if I maybe I happened to catch it at the same time.

Yesterday I took my pills again but I did a CWE on two of the pills.   I've done CWE before and I don't like the way it makes the pill euphoria come up faster but not least nearly as long.   Today I woke up again feeling slightly nauseous but not to the extent of last weekend.

I'm an recovering iv H addict, after two years of heavy daily use I made the switch to bupe. This is where I made my first mistake, I started to IV bupe. Now this went on for at least one and half years, and during that time I had a few relapses back to H. Yet over time they got fewer and further in between, until I had reached the point where I was pretty much done. It was at the point where it took me upwards of an hour to find a viable vein just to inject something that had no effect besides simply preventing W/D's. I had weened my dose down to .5 mg a day, and I decided to make the final jump to 0. I failed miserably, lasted all of 4 days before caving in and buying a sub. I felt like I'd never be able to move on, and that I'd be on bupe indefinitely. Then by a total fluke I found mid to high dose Lope to prevent all withdrawal symptoms. It was a god send, but I didn't slowly taper off, I just keep taking it. 80mg went to 100, then 120, and as of right now 150mg. During the same time I developed a rather uncommon habit, DPH. I struggled with being sober, my mind craved a high of any kind and with dph being a cheap and easy method of not being sober. To cut a long story short I now take 500 mg of DPH twice a day and I have developed a real physical addiction. With WD's being comparable to mid level opiate detox. My point is that while lope will work for bupe withdrawal, taper down as fast as you can safely handle. At the same time be wary of legal highs as a alternative. I wish all nothing but the best and I hope this helps at least one other person avoid the disaster I made for myself. ",1478962207.0

Unfortunately, this was not my experience. Taking 4 x 5mg Oxycodone (over say a 90-180 minute period) seemed dramatically less potent than 1 x 20mg Oxycontin.

I know that it the active ingredients *should* be identical, yet I'd swear the analgesia benefit is higher with the Oxycontin. Anyone else ever experience anything like this? Is Purdue using something in the time-release compound which somehow potentiates oxycodone?

Pity and hesitation is my doom

Makes me watch walls for hours

So what about, what about the time

What about making my own mistakes and let these things go

I used to sit and smoke / sniff roxy 30s out in the PJects random parking lots every day would switch it up but kept the same mcdonalds, wendys, gas station, or stop n shop. And there was this one dude that was walking around with a sign he looked extremely skinny but not drugged out.. the sign said ""CANT SPEAK, NEED MONEY FOR FOOD"" or something a little more alluring but the point is he couldn't speak apparently. So, he'd notice me smokin my blues in the parking lots eventually knocked on my window askin for a dollar or two and I would hook him up with a few bucks almost every day; but then he handed me this note one day as I was sittin there smokin a roxy..

I was like da fuck? As he handed it to me through my window and walked away. Then next day I go to same place, same time, end up seeing him again and he writes things down to interact with me ... this all sounds sketchy random but this homeless dude fuckin gets in my car (I let him) and he points down the road right into the Pjects and he introduces me to his connect for dope.

I hit him up for a g of some 7/10 tar. He said ""ight bro, come thru. I'm staying at blah blah's house again. Boom, I'm in my way to the spot. (On a total side note; today was my third day at my new job. I get 60 hours a week and start out at $11 an hour but it's pretty tough work.) So I get there and I walk up to the porch of the house he is staying. As I'm standing there in the freezing cold I see a kitten sitting there. ""Aww kitty. Come here."" I mean shit, why not play with a kitten while I wait for dude to come out. So I'm freezing cold and playing with a kitten while I wait. Kitty decides to go under this chair that was on the porch. I lift up the skirt type of thing on the bottom of the chair and see a few kittens. They were all cold and hungry. I felt bad. Dude finally comes out, we do our thing, then I ask him ""Hey man. Is blah blah trying to get rid of any of these kittens?"" To which he says ""I don't know man, I don't think so."" He goes back inside and as I get ready to leave I look back and the kitten was following me. I'm pretty sure that was the first human contact he had ever had. He was so cute and needed help.  So I decided to help him. I looked around to see if anyone was watching and there wasn't a soul around. So I grabbed the kitty and took him with me. He meowed the entire ride to my house. He was so scared and had no idea what was going on. I stopped at a gas station and got him food. We finally get to my house and I get him a bowl of water and  the can of soft cat food. I set it down and start getting my shot all mixed up and ready. He ate the entire time I got it ready and did it. He was so hungry. But in an instant the fear went away and he was happy. I set him on my bed and laid down to watch South Park. So now I'm laying here watching tv, nodding in an out, surfing Reddit, and petting my new kitten as he sleeps on my chest.

So around noon today, when my dad got home from work, and I rolled out of bed *ugh*, the above situation occured. I hadn't yet discussed or admitted my use with them post Out Patient over the summer and my 75 days clean but today was the big day I guess.

The good thing is that I want to get clean again hopefully now and had just tapered off my stash planning to do exactly so. I just recently had a tapering off\get clean/ life story post if you wanna check it out or saw it.

The bad thing, depending how you look at it, is that I'm on day 3 since my last use at the end of the taper so I've been zapped of energy. My parents were obviously on to my use again and being sick was such an obvious giveaway that their legitimate suspicions were verified enough for the talk.

I copped to occasionally using and admitted that I was afraid to tell them due to possibly  being sent to inpatient or sober living. I was honest right away, almost relieved it was being discussed, and explained I was aware i didn't follow through with my recovery post-IOP. We agreed iop was the first step of recovery with much more work to do, which I have totally slacked on.

Now that I learned the causes of my addiction, which was a huge reward for completing IOP, I need to address those causes to even further progress recovery beyond just having clean time. We talked about the importance  of getting a physical and addressing my chronic pain and Lyme disease as well as general health. I agreed with fact I should see an addiction counselor one on one which was also recommended by IOP. 

I'm lucky enough to have my parents support and understanding still, somehow, and truly appreciate my access to health insurance. I must follow through with getting the care available to me and prove how grateful I am for an opportunity others don't have. To truly get well. It's fucking tough though, junkies gonna junk, regardless of my fortunate situation. My goal is to get back out on my own next year when I get my license back, I was independent and maintaining a career for 10 years, I have to get back to that. Now I'm living at home, no license, no job, no girlfriend and STILL using regardless of frequency and comparing to worse times. I don't want to rant about being scummy, this is about getting well.

I'm still taking it in and it's kinda of surreal. I now understand why you see all these young women with older men. Older men, they treat you nice, they buy you things, don't have much of a libido, and if you close your eyes the sex is fairly easy to get through. On the real he is a pretty interesting man. We have good conversations that are intellectual and thought provoking and isn't always because of the coke. And he follows through, gives me things, actually wants to see me and just hang out. Sure with younger guys the sex is good, but they are generally selfish and expectant. They don't feel like they have to work for anything. I want to be treated like I matter. I'm tired of people just talking. Telling me all the nice things that they have planned for me that never come to fruition. Just more disappointment. 

Am I now a dope whore? Is that what this makes me? I have such mixed feelings about it. Here I am, not broke, I fucked my drug dealer and honestly I'm kind of having fun. Am I regressing? I have had never had sex for drugs or money and I have been in some really dire situations. So it's fairly confusing to me. To be honest I've had a lot of losers in my life lately, who are around my age, but end up just being selfish pricks. So maybe that attributed to it?

Any thoughts or similar experiences would be appreciated. Thanks, fam!

EDIT: Holy shit this blew up. I have to go take care of a couple things, but I'll be on here once I get settled in.

The flowers were white with a purple circle where the petal connects to the pod, the stems were hairless(or damn near)each flower had(iirc)about four petals and the crowns were varied some having more than eight nodes some five(i have pictures but every time i put pics on imgur they dont show up to the people on Reddit), the pods were a waxy greyish blue, I did a bunch of research on milking and growing them before sowing them, bought some books, watched some documentaries etc. then on a dry day around 2 in the afternoon I lanced them all(three exacto blades taped together with spacers in between each blade), I did one horizontal cut on each pod that was ready, they leaked a white milky substance that was EXTREMELY bitter(kinda tastes like when you suck the wax off a grey)so, to get to the point, I ended up with 4 grams dried resin, it is brownish black. 
 
I am NOT new to growing plants or opiate use, I have been growing psychoactives(weed, datura, morning glories etc.) and other plants for about 17 years and have been wired to morphine for at least as long. I have read MANY books dedicated to discussing pavaver somniferum growth, some of note include opium for the masses, Opium poppy garden: the way of a chinese grower and have read everything erowid and many other sites have to say(tempering it against facts) I am not a novice gardener. I used these grocery store seeds as a test/learning experience, essentially to see how hard, and, what is involved in growing the poppy, NOT because I think they have high morphine content(though everything I have read states that these grocery store seeds have morphine in them, not a lot though)and will buy proper seeds on the internet when I have the space to make a real go of it.

My question is: are the seeds sold in grocery stores the high thebaine variety? I have searched the internet high and low and googled every combination of words that I thought would yield the needed info and have gotten nothing concrete I would rather not die from smoking this, but, I would like to try it, prior to today I have put a bit into a gak pipe and tried taking the tiniest hits(hits where I could taste it but not blow any smoke out)and it tastes like heroin/morphine but...different. The first time I took a big hit, today actually, I got a warm rush in my chest, my hearing became dulled(except high treble which was painful slightly if youv'e done opiates you've likely experienced a form of this), my body felt less painful and It felt very similar to a morphine high, but not nearly as pronounced, more subtle,(placebo maybe?)it lasted about four hours. Is there some way to test the thebaine content or some way of telling, I really want to smoke this? So in summary: Is there a definitive way to know whether the opium I have has enough thebaine in it to kill me?",1479035271.0

The tumor left me with acromegaly and the start of my addiction.

The neurosurgeon started me on diludin and morphine drips with Percs intermittently while I was in the hospital for a week (I ended up with a CSF leak due to a tear from the hardened tumor.). I was then sent home with 10/325 percs I think like 90, until my appt in a week? And sent home with 180 after that appt. I went through that script quickly, called and asked for another script, was sent 120 narco 10/325 with 2 refills, then Tylenol #3 etc... you get the point.

Went to my first detox in July of that year, started NA, was clean close to 30 days etc... thennnnn my mom gets breast cancer. I started steals narcos and oxys from her, get away with it for a while, get caught again by my hubby, detox at home this time. Pretend to be clean, all sources have run out.

Summer of 2013 I get the idea to get my mom's used patches out of the trash and suck on them. (Yes I read all about crazy trash guy, which is why I wanted to tell my story. I hope this gets to him.) at first they were the 100mcg gel kind. I never smoked them, because apparently I liked my mom's skin and tissue ...(jokes) I hated the gel. The Mylan ones were my favorite.

I got away with the stealing used ones every 3 days 100 mcgs each for about three years. My husband caught me a couple times,so I was careful around him. I finally got to where I would only use in the bathroom at home, but at my mom's they just kept throwing them in the trash BAG not can. First they would last 3 days, than two, then I would only get high the first day, then use to stave off withdraws.

My mom started getting a 100 and a 25 this summer, so I was getting more, and getting more desperate to chase that high. I read trash guy say he wanted to take it off his granny and run away. Well I started doing that, without the running away. Yes, you read that correctly, I was causing my sick mama pain because of my sick THREE year addiction.

Finally in sept I couldn't do it anymore and I put MYSELF in detox. I have gone through a lot, including two mental inpatient stays, one suicide attempt, two new diagnoses (Bi-polar and ADHD) new meds, including adderall, (Which surprisingly I don't get a ""high"" just function, since I am an addict and all) and naltrexone (which I feel is my saving grace.)

If you ever think about going near this stupid toxic drug, dont!!! Trash can man, just stop while you are only on 25mcgs every six days! I remember that feeling of anticipation of finding a patch, almost to where you are shaking. Just stop, admit what you've done, go to detox, get into NA or rehab and stay alive. I promise it's worth it in the end.

I'm no spring chicken - been doing this a very long time now and it's getting to be silly. I spend every dollar of every resource I can. I spend upwards of $70 a day or more on pills and as soon as I take them, I have about 3 hours of distraction where I'm not tracking my next hit out of reflexive need.

Compounding the matter is my family that knows nothing of my current depredations - they just think we're broke all the time from <insert weekly excuse here>. 

I'm tired. I smoked a bowl and now I'm sweating tomorrow as per usual.

I stay up late as hell every night so I can put off the ""waking up"" part of my day - the part that starts with mild WD's and a copious dollop of lope and the 2 hour wait until I feel marginally functional. I sit here, watching Netflix en masse, not even moving short of reaching for my smokes or my drink, burying my psyche in stories so I don't have to think. (that wasn't supposed to rhyme)

I'm perpetually sleepy which exacerbates, well, everything. I've gotten so many advances on my check that I don't even get a check per se this week and I have bills due next Monday. I tell myself that I'll do side work to make up the difference, and I do, actually, but that just gets eaten by the pills that get eaten by my addition.

The shitty thing is, there is someone on this board that knows **precisely** this story. It's their biography to the letter.

To those like myself, in a situation all too familiar, know that I empathize. My heart goes out to all of you and hope you win out in the end. I hope you get all the money you need to fuel your addiction  as to not impact those around you that you love, or that you win clear of it altogether and learn to live again.

To learn how to not *have* to hustle, middle, steal or borrow.

Hopefully, it'll be sooner rather than later because god almighty I'm *tired*.",1479010153.0

I stopped them both about 45 days ago. But, I was taking Imodium in massive doses so I could avoid the inevitable. So 3 days ago my girl of 3 years and I split and on that day I decided enough is enough, and started the process. Cold. Fucking. Turkey. I'm on day 3 and my Grandsponser and I are going to a meeting in 30 minutes. Day 1, I was in the shower in fetal position crying, begging for the pain of both withdrawals to end, girl and pills. I recorded my self and the hell I was feeling so this never happens again. Day 2, well that was a fun time, I was flailing every body part just to get the zaps to stop, haven't slept a wink in those 2 days. In and out of the shower, every hour or 2. Thank god for hot water. The depression is too much sometimes, I beg god (who I don't believe in) to take my life. I think about giving up, hit up a couple people to see what they are doing, but realize, no. I can't. This needs to be done. If I want my life back, if I want anything to be good and real, I NEED TO STOP EATING PILLS. I finally get some sleep at 3 am on day 3. It's now 6:33pm on day 3, and I'm just so numb to everything. My depression and physical pain is so much that I just drift off into pure numbness. I miss my girl so much. She said we can talk after I'm done being sick. I sucked everything out of her because of my addiction. I'm ""clean"" 45 days, but really, it's 3. It's 3 because I'm not stealing Imodium, I'm not begging my girl to drop off Imodium where ever I'm at, I'm not putting myself in front of her. I begged for this, I begged for this pain, I felt like I got away with my run, and now, the consequences are flowing through my body. I love it. I love this pain. I can't wait to be the real me, without fucking pretending I'm clean, pretending I'm not numb from eating Imodium. I feel everything. It's great. If you can take something from this, JUST FUCKING KICK. It's going to blow so hard, but you'll never go back after this. Get your life back. It's no way to live, on opiates, every single day, don't take shit, no methadone, no suboxone, no nothing. I feared this, I did everything in my power, all my life, to avoid any pain. I feel it all, the worst pains in my life, lost the love of my life and withdrawal, full fuckin' blown. You only have to kick once, then you never have to do it again. You can do it. Don't give up on yourself. Here's a tip, if you want the ""EZ-Mode"" with withdrawal, get gabapentin, or pregabalin. It makes it a cake walk, seriously. But me, I'm in recovery, and I don't want to take anything not prescribed to me. I don't want the easy way out. I want to feel all the pain. I love you all, and this disease is horrible, boy do I know. But it can end, NOW. The ball is in your court. If I can do it, you can too. One love,

Not good to use too much or inject too often, so I only use it from time to time. Intraveinous use of tianeptine can be pretty bad for your veins and shit if you use it too much, its an incredibly caustic compound and will render your veins temporarily useless after a while, turns em into rubber cords.

I'm trying to understand the pros and cons of various methods of withdrawing oneself from H. It seems as if Suboxone, Methadone, Loperamide, and Kratom have all been discussed at length - however I've yet to find a post that compares these side by side. I have an abundance of all 4 substances, but am not sure what to take when (I understand the PWD issues w/ sub and the BBB issue w/ Lope).

If you had a stash of all 4 and wanted the easiest and fastest withdrawal possible - how would you approach the use of these? Note that despite having a big & long H habit - I can get pretty well with 2mg of sub or 20mg of methadone (I've tried high dose potentiated lope and been unsatisfied).

On a related note anybody know anything about the pharmacology of the Waissman method a.k.a. rapid detox under anesthisia? From what I can deduce - they knock you out for a few hours and hit you with Naloxone which apparently takes you through the whole WD process in just a few hours while you sleep. I don't get it. Can you really use Naloxone to compact the whole WD process into just a couple hours? If so, why isn't this more discussed here... if not, are these folks just selling snake oil?",1479102967.0

There are many people who believe that the drug war has failed, and I just saw in the news that canada is legalizing heroin as a prescription drug for those who are serious addicts. I figure that my physiology teacher teaching me about drugs saying things like ""you have a 1 in 4 chance of dying everytime you do cocaine"" is not a great place to start my education on drugs. most of what people say/hear about heroin is from media and movies. the few I know who actually have done the harder stuff have explained to me that it actually a lot different than one would expect it to be, or how it is portrayed. hence I am coming here to get some objective perspectives/views

lets say that the country you are in legalized H this second. Starting tomorrow morning you would be given a prescription for near infinite amounts of heroin, or oxycotin. Clean needles, and magically, noone would judge you. you also wouldn't be drug tested for jobs, and all of your drug related crimes were vaporized

to be clear, if you stole because you needed heroin and got caught, that would be ""cancelled"". if you prostituted yourself for cash for heroin and you got caught, that would be gone off your record. Would you say that you would easily be able to put together a new and normal lifestyle?

Would you be able to easily hold together a life? Could you live a long happy, and healthy life? Have kids? Study for school? Hold down a job?

Heroin distinguishes itself (in my opinion) in that it has little to no side effects in the biochemical sense. There are some hormonal issues caused I think? but the real issue is the crippling physical addiction

I want your guys' input

EDIT: This was not meant to be a rambling on the war on drugs and how it has failed. I personally agree that the war on drugs has failed. My question was SPECIFICALLY how much of you guys as addicts would be able to function assuming your daily heroin bill was filled in for free? The amount of money it takes to supply this would be pennies on a large enough scale. Granted some opiate users wouldn't be able to function. But from what I understand many users get little to no effects from H. just a decrease in WD symptoms. Others definitely get high but in my experience, the opiate high (in reasonable amounts) is fairly functional. this based on my experience with opium, codeine, kratom, and my few experiences with oxy.

I understand the grip of this addiction. I am not here to preach, I am only asking for you to be safe. always use with a buddy present who is able to dispense naloxone if needed. For those new to opiates, please weigh up the consequences of experimenting with them. For those in recovery, be bold and hopeful, it is a long and hard battle but it is worth it.

2) why does everyone say smoking ecp is a waste? I've always had an excellent time smoking it, and also smoking blues(only the 30mg, otherwise I'd sniff the smaller ones. I mean SOMETIMES I get bad shit where it wouldn't melt on the foil so ya couldn't chase the dragon, but besides that it elastase felt better and was a good time, so what's the deal? 

3) I feel like some people actually CAN do opiates once in a while, maybe even once a week and maintain a healthy stable life. Me? Lmao nah, not me, but I've met plenty! God I wish I had the willpower!

I was just thinking to myself, despite the countless hours of pain I can directly attribute to opiates over the past 8 years, I wouldn't trade in all the pleasurable moments I've had, and I for one would not wish to go back and never get acquainted with opiates. 


We only have this one life to live, and you get one chance to experience all that the world has to offer before you once again slip back into the nonexistence from whence you came. I feel like living a whole life and never having gotten to experience that beautiful, beautiful rush of opiates taking over your body and mind... well it's almost as sad to me as living your whole life and dying a virgin. I've seen people in some of the most profound pain because of problems with love, but most of us don't say to people just getting their first crush ""quit now while it's easy"" or ""I wish I could go back to before i knew what an orgasm felt like so I could just never fuck or masturbate"".


I know this will be with me the rest of my life. I'll have clean times, I will use again, I'll have pain again. I'll take it all, though, knowing I didn't shy away because of someone's advice to leave it all alone - someone who already got their ride on the merry go round, is trying to help someone else avoid pain understandably, but in that same way is also preventing that person from what may be a profound and beautiful life experience. 



I know that people, even ones that used to be voices here, have died because of opiates, but people have also died rock climbing, scuba diving, traveling to space, riding motorcycles, skydiving. A life lived completely devoid of experiences that come with a danger factor seem like a life half lived to me. 


To all those newcomers lurking around and wondering what to do, by all means, do as much research and read as many personal experiences as you can, and when you feel informed enough, if you want to hop on the ride still, it's your life; don't deny yourself the experience out of fear unless that's what you really want. Once you are dead that is it - you may tell yourself congratulations, you lived and died never having experienced the pain of this addiction, but you also lived and died quite possibly only having experienced a tiny, tiny fraction of the euphoria that existed in this world and was there, potentially available to you, waiting for you. The pain won't matter when you are dead. In my last moments, though, if I go in such a way that allows me final thoughts, I will be thinking of my most euphoric moments - many of which are with family and friends, and many with my body and mind alive with an ungodly amount of pleasure. I'll take my ""disease"" gladly, knowing it means I got to experience what I did.",1479061160.0

Dope, Fent, and ""50/50"" mixes are openly sold. I normally prefer dope since fent puts in withdrawals 2 hrs later whereas dope keeps me well for 8, often 12 hrs. 

Well my apt for getting on subs is at 9am tomorrow - I need to be off dope for 24 hrs before getting on subs according to my doctor. With when I did it last 9am would mean me being off for 29 hrs.

I went and scored some fent since I figured I could do it quite close till 9am since it throws me into heavy ish wds in only 2 hrs (mad sweats, beginning chills and dilated pupils). 

So I'm asking how long would I be able to do fent for before having to cut myself off in preparation for subs at 9am? As it stands it's 12am here right now - I'm leaning towards 5am but am not sure and looking for input.

Looking for some advice. I need to quit for the holidays...wondering about your experience with kratom (specifically to taper off or replace h). I have an ounce in the mail on the way. I've never tried it. I have 20mg of suboxone as well, but I don't believe it will be enough on its own if I try a rapid taper. Currently 7-10 bags IV'd per day habit. 

From what I understand, kratom doesn't interfere with suboxone - does this mean I can use kratom when I induce suboxone? The idea is to take 5-10g kratom when the WD's start after the last H dose, and once I'm at least 24 hours in, take 4mg of sub (if I'm still feeling sick).

Does that sound reasonable? For me, starting to withdraw and waiting for it to get worse and worse until its been ~24 hours is the absolute worst part of suboxone. Also, with a habit like mine, it can take a while to stabilize and feel okay on subs. If I could use kratom in between that would be amazing - thoughts?

Many, if not all if we have neem in the game logn enough, will know someone, or at least know of someone in which this cost them their lives. Personally, I have found that there are three groups:

1) The ones who genuinely have an accident, and had no wish to end it all at that point

2) Those who knowingly take extreme risk (no test shot, high dose, mixed with alcohol/ benzos, speedball, on their own) and don't really care if they wake up or not. 

3) Those who intenionally take a dose they are sure they will never wake up from


Personally, I have found that 2 and 3 are far more common than we like to admit. 1 certainly occurs - for example an addict getting out of jail and getting their first fix, but I have found this to be rare in comparision to the other two. I actually think 2 is the most common reason for people to OD. *Technically* it would be an accidental death from opiate use, but I think many addicts, particuarly long-term users who see no way out, aren't particuarly concerned about whether or not they awake, and hence take extreme risk aformentioned.

I put them in my grandmothers name because I didnt have an ID at the time and wantedbto be able to cash it, DIDNT SAY ANYTHING about it I figured she wouldnt know why she got it and she said she had no idea about it yadayadayada, etc.

Well, they are trying to keep it and its bullshit, now they are trying to say they know where it came from.

5cy2wp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5cy2wp/reusing_wheel_filters/,7,https://redd.it/5cy2wp,two_one_fiver,Reusing wheel filters,"Hi gang. Long time reader, infrequent poster.

I usually use dope nasally. On the occasions when I do shoot, I always use a fresh needle each time, and a sterile packaged 0.22 micron wheel filter. I draw up the solution and push it through the filter into a clean container, then I draw it up with a special ""loading"" needle (so I don't blunt the tip on my injecting needle) and use that to load the needle that I IV with.

Now, a 0.22 micron filter is small enough to filter out bacteria and fungi. So my question about these is: what would be the consequences of re-using a used wheel filter? I tend to binge for a couple days when I do inject, and then go for long periods of time without shooting up - so if I did re-use a wheel filter, it would be one that I'd used just a day or two ago. Obviously cooking down old cottons yields the risk of ""cotton fever"" or another infection, but because the wheel filter is so small, I'm wondering - can bacteria even grow on it? And if they did, would the 0.22 micrometer pores filter them out? If anyone knows, please let me know.

For now, I have access to sealed, sterile filters, so I won't be re-using any, but I'm curious about how bad this would be, exactly.

EDIT: forgot to mention one of the best things about wheel filters. They're very easy to get a ""rinse"" from - just push a little water through them. Anything soluble will be picked up, and cut etc. will stay in the filter. They also don't retain nearly as much fluid or active substance as a cotton does. I ""lose"" less than 1/10 of my shot (by volume) any time I use a wheel filter. The ones with smaller surface area take longer and require more pressure, but there's less potential for solution to get left behind. If you aren't already using these, I REALLY recommend them. The difference is night and day - the solution comes through with no cloudiness or particulate matter or anything, just colored from the dope. It's way better than any cotton filter I've ever seen. (Cotton filters and cig filters are about 50 microns, for comparison to the 0.22 micron wheel.)",1479154304.0

I made the decision to go to the ER and see what they could do for me, and was offered a 4 day rapid methadone detox (20mg-15mg-10mg-5mg). That relieved most of the major symptoms, but after being discharged, the anxiety and inability to control my muscles from spazzing all day, lack of sleep, and generally shit feeling actually caused me to start hallucinating. Dr. gave me a script of ativan which was tremendously helpful, but I still ended up back in the ER because I was 2 hits of acid tripping (only way I can describe it). 36 hours later I was discharged and back on my own.

Fortunately through all of this, I had an amazing psych Dr helping me out. We landed on serequel after the benzos were causing intense rebound anxiety, and I finally feel normal.

I just want to share my experience with the drug that almost every opiate addict has probably considered, or been on at one point. Yeah, I didn't use opiates for 5 years straight, but I was hooked hard on the subs. I am not sure if it was worth it. Consider your options if you are trying to get off the opiates.
