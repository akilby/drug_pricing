I got hit hard leaving a deal and ended up in a conference room with a 3 page contract in front of me. They had me on video and I could do a few years in prison for distribution or sign that and be on my way. I signed. All it really says is you aren't allowed to fuck for dope.

Once you work off your charge you start to get paid. I get paid 10% of whatever gets seized. Ounce of heroin for example street price ,2500 I get paid 250. They give the paper white boy drug prices but paying out not so much.

How it works is this. The deals the CI do the dealers aren't charged. The deals are just to get probable cause for a search warrant for car or home. What that turns up is where the charges come from. This keeps my identity a secret.

The biggest giveaway on deals where narcs are involved are the cars. There will be 4-5 cars shadowing the deal. They are obvious as fuck to me and I have no clue how people don't notice. Also, I don't wear wires, cameras, etc. They are filming from a block away.

I'm in a major city in the south and the one thing I found interesting is as soon as ounces are being discussed it gets kicked over to DEA. I was surprised it took so little to involve them.

To me a recovering heroin addict when I first got sober I somewhat bought the disease argument, as I've spent more time I can't think of it as an incurable disease. I personally believe it's a grey area, the mind creates a very strong mental and physical craving for the drugs and an unwillingness to face the withdrawal symptoms and you can see why people getting addicted to substances for long times.

However, my biggest concern about the disease diagnosis is that a lot of addicts I've met create a label in there head. They create a belief that they have this incurable disease and this belief becomes almost subconscious; becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

In my personal story, I always dislikes the diagnosis that I had a helpless malady. So the label never stuck.

I bought some percs from a close friend and took them, but I absolutely hated the way they made me feel. Dizzy, light-headed, drowsy, etc. Fast forward a few months and I meet a guy in my class who is selling 40mg OC Oxycontin for FOUR DOLLARS A PILL. I found this too good to be true, so I bought one and swallowed it and I had the most euphoric experience of my life. This was strange to me because I hated percs, but I loved how Oxycontin made me feel. I've always been fascinated by drugs because my birth parents were both coke and heroin addicts. I was adopted at the age of 1 and I lived with my adoptive parents my entire childhood. 

After this fantastic experience, I started buying quite a bit of oxy. I would only do it once a week at first, but inevitably it progressed and soon I was doing it three times a week. I was snorting 80mg of oxy in the bathroom at my high school at least weekly, as well as doing it spread out throughout the week. However, I never let myself get physically addicted to it because I knew how bad the withdrawals would be. 

I believe that I started using out of curiosity, but also because I knew that it would help me cope with my mental disorders. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, social anxiety, as well as OCD. Of course opiates helped because they make you feel wrapped in a warm blanket free of troubles and worries. After a few months though, my plug got caught stealing these pills from his dad (fucked up, I know). So I stopped doing opiates regularly but my tolerance remained generally the same. Over the past four years I've taken a multitude of opioids but they've all been spread out. I am 18 now and I still have to rail at least 80mg to get an actual ""nod"". 

Thankfully, I've made it a point to not seek out opiates but I get incredibly intense cravings from time to time that send me into a deep depression. I feel as though, during these times, that opiates are the only thing will ever make me truly happy. I know that I shouldn't get back into them because they will fuck up everything in my life but when this feeling comes it stays for a long time. So now I come to the point of my post.

1. How do you deal with intense mental addiction to opiates?
2. Why do you think that I have such a naturally high tolerance to opiates? I've never felt any nausea from taking any opiate at any dose, even fentanyl. Even when I took an OC 40 for the first time all I felt was pure bliss.
3. Do you think I could constrain myself to doing it only monthly or so and not fall back into my habit? I did it once, but I don't know what would happen if I tried again.

What's the explanation behind it? Knowing that opioids cause respiratory depression and how some research claim they can affect immune cells function, increase histamine release causing bronchospasm, vaso-constriction and hypersensitivity reactions.

How to know when you're ""in the clear""?","I'll begin this by saying I'm pretty sure I'm worrying for nothing lol-- I've been awake for going on 38+ hours now and that alone tends to trigger my PTSD symptoms something awful. Not to mention having a few other anxious situations happen over the day. Anyways I'll get to it...

I got a handful of oxycodone 30s last night. My tolerance always starts at 15mg every 4 hours or so unless of course I spent the previous day getting high as well. Anywho, I've been clean a good few months, so I started out this morning at 8:30 am with my 15mg. Usually I don't take more than 45mg in a twelve hour period. However the first dose didn't seem to give me much of a high so around 10 am I popped the second half, giving me a total of 30mg in my system. At 2:30, popped another 15mgs. Then around 6pm I had the second half of that, giving me a total 60mgs in my system between the hours of 8:30am until now (it's 10:35pm my time)

I can tell you that I have no idea why I decided to pop that last 15. I actually don't even remember the exact time when I did, though it wasn't any later than 6:30, of that I'm sure. I also only vaguely remember eating that last half, but I know I did.

I was doing alright up until around 8 pm when the nod-out effects began. Did some chores, had a mini-freak out over the discovery of a minor health issue with my dog, dealt with that accordingly, had a quick dinner and have been chilling in bed for about an hour.

I've had this happen a few times where I psyched myself out in thinking I might have overdosed, so I suppose I'm curious-- and obviously, definitely would like to know any important info about whether I may actually OD in the future-- to how I can figure out whether or not I should seek medical attention. A lot of it honestly is my lack of health insurance and the horrible stress it'd add to everything else if I had hospital bills to deal with as well.

I was reading through another post here (probably some ancient thread tbh) and a commenter said he wouldn't be able to write anything remotely coherent if he'd taken 'too much'-- and if he tried he'd nod out so much that one sentence would take him 45 minutes to finish lol. Hopefully this is coherent, and I've only had a couple moments where closing my eyes sounded suuuper great right now haha.

Anyways. I'll wrap this up by admitting that if I'm gonna fuck around with these meds, I can't *fuck around* with these meds, you know. I promise I'm not as foolish as my actions in regards to taking more than necessary today shows I am. If anything, y'all let me know whether that last sentence makes any damn sense at all? Haha.

Despite that I can't imagine never touching an opiate again so I want to get my tolerance back down to it's initial state and keep it there. 

I've got 30 mg of suboxone, kratom and ketamine on hand and also plan on getting a script for naltrexone. My plan is this:

Rapid taper with the subs over the course of a week and a bit until I can jump off without any withdrawal symptoms or only minor ones. After this start with the naltrexone at a low dose. I've read this can reset the brain to an almost opiate naive state. I'll continue this for a couple weeks after which I'll start chipping again. This time though I'm going to take small doses of ketamine or dxm on the days I'm doing dope.

1.  Just use pregabalin/Xanax until it passes (my preference, time to empty the receptors)
2.  Use small amounts of tramodol (like 150mg split into 2 doses throughout the day) for a day or two.

Shit's been rather good since I got clean, almost shocked at how fast my life has turned around in a month. After getting laid off, I now make far more money then I ever did at that job, and it's all tax free (but legit, I'm supposed to pay taxes eventually). 


No I am not a stripper. My dick is too small, and my tits are too big.


But on that same note, I've lost over 15 pound in the last month, about 30 over 4 months. I always, lose weight when I get off dope, and always balloon when I get on it.


That being also said, hopefully my body will be beach sexy in a month (or at least above ground pool sexy). Since I'm going to [redacted] country on a vacation, to which I actually am able to pay for (holy fuck). I learned that prositution is basically legal, I never knew how many countries either had it legal, or didn't care, in the Americas (and well pretty much everywhere, IDK how I fell into this prostitution rabbit hole, I liteerally have more interest in the law aspect of it, then actually....you know,  hoho!

No that isn't my primary reason to go there, I wanted to see monkeys, that was my reasoning. Then I learned this after the fact....hey quit looking at me like that. I was absolutly not planning on having sex with the monkeys. Dammit, I should just stop tying, o well too late. backspace is broken because I said it is.

I never thought in my life i'd be able to afford another trip. But hotel's been paid for, visa is in order, tickets almost bought. So expect some cool pics around my 60 day update!


If anyone can guess the country, I throw like 5 dollar btc your way for lulz, just felt like making it entertaining around here for you guys, since when has there been any kind of contest or fun here?


>BUT LANA, THIS IS R/OPIATES, THERE IS ZERO FUN HERE ALLOWED!


As you can tell, I'm really bored this morning, I hope you guys are doing good. To those trying the lame, sober road like me, keep on trucking. To those taking the cool, fun road, be safe bruh, do a shot for me, but don't go overboard!


edit: Rules:

1 guess per person, don't be a dick and make multiple accounts. It's just for fun, and only 5 bucks, come on don't be a dick.

194 chances! gogogo


**rule addenmun edit:**

So to put a sense of urgency, and add more fun, I decided to put a dead line, let's say exactly 1pm, eastern standard time, you win! I had in my head 3 countries I'd go to (in case no one guessed it, maybe should have mentioned that, but o well lol) New Zealand.  So someone is going to win, or I can send you fent test kits, I got a pack of 10 coming, I will send 5 or 5 dollars 

hell I may do 2 prizes, not sure yet, depends if the strips come in, I aint rich! one 5 dollar, one 5 pack of fent strips in bit coin, your choice if you win, runner up gets the other (fent strips havn't got here yet, so if they do not come in a reasonable amount of time, should be today, $5 with default, offer valid in 194 counties, not valid in DPRK, unless you got monies.)


Also, if no one get it by midnight tonight, eastern time, you can guess again before 1PM. :) Why am I doing this?! I'm just fucking bonkers today, this is cool by the mods right?


if this works out, I'll do more fent strip give aways and btc give away in the future (nothing insane, like no more then 5 dollars, or I may just order a ton of fent strips and do that).  The fent epidemic is something I'm completely unfamiliar about, we don't really see fent down here, but I've met people personally effected by it. So it scares the shizzle outta me. I think one of the steps is servicework? Consider this kinda that?


**CONTEST OVER, WE HAVE A WEINER**: u/achemicaIreaction claim yo prize foo! Stand by u/drugstorecowbro for a second prize in time, or if he doesn't give me a response in a day. I'll be staying a block away from Trumps Silver Weiner overlooking the Pacific!


really the point of this, I just wanted to share some positivity that's been going on in my life, with you guys. hope you had a larf! I think I will post this once a week, after Last Week Tonight airs on the east coast! So check back then, hopefully I'll be able to get more fent kits, and make this something cool, really this was just kinda testing the waters!",1520258380.0
825zeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/825zeh/recently_tried_plugging_hydromorphone/,5,https://redd.it/825zeh,FirstEverAlt,Recently tried plugging hydromorphone,"And I loved it! 

When it's up to me, I'll always grab hydromorph contins - the big capsules full of tiny beads - and crush and snort them. I'm not a needle person, so the intranasal way has always worked fine for me. However, I recently got my hands on some low mg hydromorphone pills (I guess they're dilaudid), 4 and 5mgs. 

The first time I had them a couple of months ago, I tried to snort one but it's just too much powder compared to the little crushed beads I'm used to. So I ended up just eating most of them (not all at once lol, just over the course of the week or whatever), and like, it sort of worked, but I was munching them every couple of hours and was just sort of ""well"" as opposed to high. 

Anyways, so this time I got the 4mg dilaudid again, and both yesterday and today I plugged 3 of them when I got up. This morning I plugged the 3 and then was able to lie on my bed for 10 or so minutes while I waited, and I actually felt that wonderful, warm opiate come-up buzz! I used to get that nice come-up feeling when taking percocets when I was younger, and that feeling is probably what attracted me to opiates in the first place. I didn't even think I could get that feeling anymore, so it was quite a pleasant surprise! 

Anyways, I made an alt account just to share this because I had to tell someone. So if anyone out there is considering plugging but is feeling deterred by the idea of putting something in your butt, I'm just here to vouch for it. I'm feeling *quite* nice and high now, and it's been about an hour and a half since I dosed. 

Thanks for reading, and I hope you're all having a nice day too! ",1520257241.0

A good, ""trusted"" dealer gave them to me (market price too) giving me the story they came from a friend who had a pharmacy connection.  He's been a great dealer for about bhalf a year now, btw.  But with Percs.  His source dried up (thanks Sessions) and this new contact came in.  He reassured me 100% trustable.  But you know how that is.

Anyway, I didn't have strips to test, so sampled a half of a quarter of a 30 mg pill (like 4 mgs).  It hit almost immediately, but didn't have any euphoric effect.  Still felt something lacking in my gut.  But did something, felt intense...but like a downer with intent.  Every fiber of me felt it.  It stopped the cravings in my gut for an hour or two.  I have no idea how to describe it other than it temp. shut down dope cravings and sort of felt good for an hour?  Then felt ""heavy"" and non-euphoric but was doing something and that lasted another few to four hours.

So the next day I did a quarter (7 to 8 mgs).  Same but more intense.  At this point I thought it was all in my head since I was used to Percosets and Morphine.  Maybe it was a brand switch?  But Oxys are supposed to be amazing, and they are dereived from same dope. Right?

Next day I did half a 30mg pill.  All day (7 hrs), I had the feeling I was still going through withdrawls from my previous Persoset supply being cut short (tapered off to 7 mgs a day though) and thought the Roxys would totally help, but they weren't, but I was feeling super intense and focused, but off at the same time. Which sucked as I was in an important biz mtg.  I tried to sleep as I felt insanely tired, but could not slow myself down for a nap.  Weird.

So the withdrawls continued to claw at my gut today, but I felt this heavy feeling again when I took a quarter of the A-215s.  So I texted my friend to see what was up with him.  My friend who went in on the buy says the same.  We both do believe they aren't Roxys.  We met tonight and discussed it for a few hours and we think it's not just in our heads.  But damn they seem/look legit, and this dealer is too.  If not Fent, what other crap can they be pressed with?  What have we been taking?  Hopefully not Fent + benzos + Adderall or something.  All hard to get off of.  But hey, look where I'm posting.

They look perfect.  Good speckling, cut in half...the right color inside.  They taste bitter when you lick them (but not overwhelming).

They only strange thing is when you cut them with a knife, they are rock hard.  Seems weird. Takes some muscle to cut them into fourths.  Is that normal?  Part of me thinks we found someone really good at the pill press with Adderal mixed with Xanax or baby power or something with a dash of Fent. 

Testing a pill for Fent tomorrow (my friend is picking up strips).  Fuck this.  The whole three days I've been in withdrawls despite.  Only tonight took 7mgs of Morphine and SUDDENLY felt relief.  Roxys these are not.

823xs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/823xs8/bupetolerancedph_question/,2,https://redd.it/823xs8,AbanoR,Bupe/Tolerance/DPH question,"So I took my usual weekly hydrocodone and the usual potentiators (including DXM, Tagamet etc...), plus my IV benadryl. (I don’t need anyone telling me that that is dumb, I’ve heard it all already). 

IVing the Dph has in the past always created a more intense experience since it comes on so much quicker. I also crush and dissolve the hydro in water so it hits quicker as well. I usually do 50mg of dph though, this time I did 100mg. I’ve always enjoyed the sedation from that amount, even by itself though I don’t do that often. 

I didn’t get the feeling I had come to expect AT ALL and it was a dramatic change from previous experiences. I felt good for sure but it wasn’t anything like in the past, and I’d gotten pretty consistent results with my weekly ritual for at least a month and a half. Now, I have used some oxy I managed to get ahold of and extra lortabs over the past 2~3 weeks when normally I limit myself to Sunday night. I also took a sub yesterday at around noon (4mg). 

So my question is this, did I not get as high as I had come to expect:
1) Simply because of tolerance? Doing to much other stuff outside of my weekly indulgence? I wasn’t popping pills all day mind you, I just got high a few more times over those weeks than normal. Maybe two or three times a week. 

2) Because I took to much dph maybe? If there’s a sweet spot maybe I overshot it? I always figured that the more dph the stronger the opiate high but I guess there could be a point where it out muscles the opiates euphoria in favor of sedation. 

3) Or because the sub I took Saturday was still in my system and blocked some of the effects? I was told to wait 24-36 hours which I did but this still happened.  I took it several different ways only a small amount at a time because I was unfamiliar with it and because I just couldn’t seem to make the sublingual method work. 

It’s frustrating me because I have limited access to my DOC and not getting what I had come to expect is a real bummer. I know tolerance is a bitch, but I’m hoping y’all might be able to tell me if there is another reason, one that I could easily fix. Mind you, this wasn’t just a little less of a high, this almost felt like nothing and only lasted maybe an hour. My usual routine (which I’ll post below), used to have me floating on cloud nine and you’ll notice that it’s a little weaker than what I did tonight. 

30-45~ minutes prior to opiates
75mg hydroxizine pamoate
25mg diphenhydramine 
1000mg Tagamet
1 naproxen sodium
1 big swig of DXM
Big glass of grapefruit juice and tonic water

With opiates: 50mg of hydrocodone. 
25mg hydroxizine pamoate
50~mg diphenhydramine IV
200mg Tagamet
1000mg of calcium carbonate
1 big swig of DXM. 

Next time I think I’m gonna do this down to a T after a little tolerance break and compare results but for now I’d love some input on what might be the problem. ",1520230743.0

I have been collecting all of my medicine since i was 12.
When i was 12 my parents explained to me that the expiration dates on the medicine bottles of pills that are pressed mean absolutely nothing.
8 years later, when i am 20, i research this myself and find out that it is true

fast forward another 10 years

and i have saved every single medication since i was 12

So i have a lot of codeine, antibiotics, and a few other things (promethazine, benzos, allegra, prednisone, 5 cases of prescription ear drops, eye drops, low-doseage codeine,  and a few other things that are escaping my mind)

. I would be ok for a few months . Medication would be valuable in an apocalyptic scenario .

This is something that repeats over and over again in my head:
I dont wanna be sober if an apocalyptic , zombie, world-war, scenario occurred. so to speak. 

in theory it would actually be better to lay low highly medicated without moving therefore going undected . 

If you did not have your pharmaceuticals available before the scenario you wouldmost  ikely have less than 12 hours.

During the Blackout of 77 in New York City all of the stores were looted within a hour . People of the highest social standing were reduced to looters. Most people were looting things they needed.

And dose for dose ratio it’s 1:1 hydrocodone:morphine oral, however morphine only has a bioavailability of *about* 30% orally? So technically 30mg of morphine should roughly be 10mg of hydrocodone? hydro’s bioavailability is roughly 87% quite like Oxycodone, however oxycodone is x1.67 stronger than Hydrocodone I believe according to equi-analgesia chart. 

So I’m theory considering strength and bioavailability it’d seems morphine is the weakest orally dosage wise of them all?

But I gotta share a lil story cause I'm high rn and honestly didn't think it would happen today.
So let's back up. 
I lost my biggest flow of income recently and was not prepared. My girl and I are gonna be going into wds no matter what pretty much but damn dog I wanted to prepare a little.

 So day before yesterday I got a half on credit from my main dude but I know full well I can't pay his ass back.
I'm riding the bus home and I see this dude and I just know, (you know when you know), that he fucks with opiates.
Young black dude, thuggish, got one eye, big ass pores, but he's doing alright,  decent clothes jewelry. 
He's in the seat in front of me so I pull out my phone and lean over and call my banks automated system, 
it's a robot bish named Maggie and her only job in the world is to remind me how broke I am. 
So I say,""yo can you talk?"" That's all Maggie does is talk, ""press # for more options you broke ass mafk"", she says.
""Aight"", I say, ""you talk to Keisha?, well shit you better. Old boy paid in full for them fingers."" (Now I got the dude in front of me's attention. )
 ""Aight og"", I say and hang up. 
Few seconds later the dude leans over, ""ay I know you fuck with that food, make a nigga some money."" 
I was like ""bet, gimme yo number""
Flash forward to today and I'm sick af and after all day all I can manage to get up is $16 I'm like fuck... so I call old boy and a woman answers.
She says ""she's his ex and they ain't together anymore.""
I'm like fuck, so after awhile, like 3 hrs later I'm thinking fuck it, I'm gonna try to cold cop wit $16 and I start walking toward the cheapest gas station in the hood. 15mins in to walking I get a call and it's the dude, he called his ex asking if I called for him.
He was right down the street pulled up in 20 mins and sold me a twamp (.2) for $16.
It's fenty forsure but I'm not complain for how little I got, we ain't sick that's fosho.
Anyways if you read it right on, if not, idgaf.",1520225179.0

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520205927.0

*Paging purresident meff experts - /u/nosecandiez and /u/spinderella69 -- Please bless me with your knowledge.*

So I'm doing my once a pay period chip today...

I have my shitty heroin where .4 will barely get me where I want to be and I also have what wassupposedto be a gram of coke.

But, as you can probably guess, it fucking isn't.

It' a gram of what is obviously shitty meth. It smells like chemicals and tastes like ass. Now, because drug dealers don't exactly have a return policy I'm stuck with this shit.

I did a matchstick head sized bump as, I suppose, a test... And, okay, aside from the shaking hands and the fact I'm worried my overweight heart might explode *(I'm joking... more or less)* I'm okay doing this.

So, I guess my questions are as follows...

I'm obviously going to bang this shit, because, well, it's what I do. How much is an acceptable/safe amount to do based on my zero tolerance and the above report of the match-head bump?/

How many shots should I get out oh the just under a gram I have left?

Do I need to add heat to break it down in a spoon? For that matter is there anything special I need to know about banging da meff?

I'm saving the heroin for either the last shot, all nice and goofball-y, or as landing gear for when the well runs dry. Which is the better plan?

Lastly, how long between shots should I wait? I imagine it's gonna be fiend-y as fuck, so I'm hoping if I can make a scjedule  that'll help.

That's it ya'll.

Thanks - andfuck my d-boy for fucking my coke order up. Idiot asshole.

**Bonus Question - What are some fun things to do after shooting this nonsense?**

--------------------------

*First shot of 125 mg being prepared - 4:47pm -- Wish me luck*

*Make that, ""First shot of 200 mg"" is now prepared. Gonna piss then spend the next hour hunting for a vein. -- 5:19pm*

*My veins are absolutely shit. The 200 mg shot missed, but oddly enough didn't hurt at all. Didn't hurt when pushing, doesn't hurt now, an hour and a half later.*

*Currently working to get rid of this shit... I've decided it just is not my thing.*

------------------------------

*11:3o-ish am - My dealer brought me over 1.5 of coke to make up for this mistake.*

*I think I'll do a goofy speedball*

There has been a couple very weird batches going around. I've gotten some like this, other ppl in my state. And my friend in the next state over.. Called me frantic the other night when he got something similar. 

I was buying fent off this dude for the past year. It was always white as snow, powder and clear in the rig. And it was fent for sure, as I tested it. Plus I always got pinned out, really warm, and super noddy. Well my plug was dry for half a day then picked up more. Now he always got the same thing. But everytime he reupped, I always did a tester shot first. Just because its fent i'm dealing with, and just incase something was not cut as much and too strong. Well thank fucking god I did because I prob would've died. 

I mixed the shot up, drew it up and only shot a tiny bit. Im talking like 5 units. All of a sudden, my heart started racing really fast. I was like ""ugh, great wtf is this""? Tried to be calm and not freak out totally, as this would make it worse. Then my heart started POUNDING. Wicked uncomfortably. Now I love shooting coke and speedballs. This was NOTHING like that at all. It was such a yucky feeling and just didnt feel right at all. I wouldn't have even thought there was any fent in it at all, besides the fact I was wicked sick before I did it.. But I got off E at least. It started to subside a little over time. But I still felt shaky and uppidy for a while after. 

There was another time something almost identical happened to me over this past summer. Bought it off one of my other dealers. But it was the same looking white powder. That time, the feeling came and went with the rush. Didn't linger for hours like this recent time. But that time, it made my pupils HUGE like I was rolling.

Ive shot dope/fent, coke, crack, ketamine, and molly before. And this weird ""fent"" or whatever the fuck it was.. Felt NOTHING like any of the other drugs Ive tried before. Has anyone else ever had stuff like this? 



TLDR; Was buying the same fent off this dude for almost a year. Got what was supposed to be fent, the same usual stuff I been doing (white powder, clear in the rig). But when I shot it, my heart started racing then pounding. Was mad jittery for like 2hrs after the shot. Out of 2 sketchy times this happened, one time my pupils turned to saucers.

I spent my hotel money for the day on getting my puppers from the pound. Spoiled him and his mammy then got me high with the rest. 

Last time I actually lived outside I had a boyfriend by my side, my puppers, and was an unattractive lardass. I had no worries. I'd be lying if I didn't say being a skinny 'attractive' single female alone doing this didn't scare the shit out of me. Minding my own business with the doggies I got two $20s from guys who were trying to persuade me in the benefits of scratching each other's backs. Figuring out how to get my point across to these types is something I need to do ASAP. 
'No, I will not hook up with you for money.' 
'No, I will not date you for money.' 'If I'm single or not is irrelevant to you but thanks for the $20! I'm going to snag some breakfast tacos for my boyfran with it.' 
'No, you cannot have my number.' 'Fine, I will take yours and promise to get ahold of you as soon as I get phone turned on and charged later. I absolutely promise!' 
'Absolutely fucking do not try to hug me just to see how my dog reacts to it.'
'NO MEANS NO EVEN FOR HUGS DUDE.' 
Trying to exploit me for my less than favorable situation is the lowest of the low but refusing to take the hint and keep lingering is a sure fire way to get socked in the nuts. I didn't sleep with my fine ass persistent dealers even during my sickest brokest moments, you honestly think I'ma cave for a dude giving me extremely creepy mccreeperson vibes to get a roof over my head for the night? You found me perfectly content in the freezing cold roofless. He needs better leverage or a rag with chloroform. 

I made the full and complete decision to put myself in this situation, have to sacrifice for a better future. Right? I left a warm cozy house with a big comfy bed for this shit. My animals were miserable and treated like Sarah McLaughlin could make a home visit. I constantly heard the lady I lived with telling people my younger dog shouldn't even be alive and if she physically seen him she'd welcome him with a bullet. Enough of that so called animal lover talk and eventually my dog started moping around as if he was suicidal. She constantly threatened calling animal control on me for my cats just for the sheer number I had, not because they were miserable or miss treated. For all of ours sanity I decided a week of semi roughing it was better than another minute in those conditions. She randomly gave me pain pills and bars whenever she had them so I'mma miss that perk for sure. 

I only have to survive til Wednesday morning than I won't have to worry about where I can charge my phone next. I'm worried I made a careless irreplaceable mistake making this decision that has been leading to more than usual stress which makes me want to use more. Catch 22 for sure. I have a support system but am being stubborn about accepting help because I want to handle it all myself for once. 

I'm either going to fail losing everything that matters to me all at once, try to get smart with the wrong creeper and end up in some real life episode of Criminal Minds, or steady stay high and just let the flow decide my fate. ",1520196100.0

Hi Guys, Its time for my old ass to kick this shit again. Tolerance is gone to high to get stoned without shooting. I haven't shot since 2004 and really want to avoid that.

I used to shoot all the drugs, and lots of them. Overdoses, seizures - The whole nine.

I stopped and life has done a complete 180. I'm in school and could not be doing better, employed, eating well, exercising, sleeping 9 hours per night...The list goes on.

I want to use hallucinogens again. In my mind, they are completely separate from all other drugs. I've never struggled to moderate my use of psychedelics. If anything, they seem to have anti-addictive, life-affirming properties. 

I want to hear opinions on this from former addicts. The standard 12-step rhetoric shuts this idea down immediately based on principle, but I am interested in a more rational discussion.

Have YOU been able to take hallucinogens sparingly, for personal enrichment, after a period of sobriety? 


Please, only respond if you struggled with addiction. I want firsthand reports. I've already read all of the medical studies pertaining to hallucinogens and addiction, those are not what I'm looking for.

Thank you for sharing your experiences.",1520344211.0

Exams are only a couple of weeks away and I'm missing days of uni atm. But I just can't get myself out of bed. I try to counter the coke hangover with heroin but I ran out now and I'm afraid I'll buy some more coke if I hit up my dboy. It's a cluster fuck.



Using coke doesn't even feel good anymore! I don't feel any part of the rush, but nasty side effects and my tolerance has skyrocketed, not to mention how my arms look. It's expensive and I notice my attention span decreasing. Concentrating and grasping complex concepts is harder than usual. I've been sleeping and thinking about offing myself since I ran out of coke and money on Friday. Still, the cravings are irrationally intense. I've never experienced anything like this with opiates and it's fucking scary. As if my brain is hijacked. 




I know it'll pass, but even without the coke hangover pulling me down - what perspective is there for me? I might have a career lined up but life still isn't really enjoyable to me. Plus for how long will I keep a job with my addiction taking over the front seat every now and then? I feel socially isolated and can't talk to anyone about what I think and feel. My 'friends' don't know or don't care that I'm struggling with one more habit. And I wouldn't know what they could do if they cared. It's not like their knowledge of my addiction or depression makes them ask. It's only small talk and God, am I sick of small talk. 




One of my roommates is consistently trying to make me fall in love with him and is so busy with making good impressions that he doesn't notice what's going on with me. Not that he'd be any help, he's a little thick and has the bad habit of interpreting a woman's kindness as sexual interest. Another bad habit is to only see things in relation to himself, as if he was the center of my universe LOL. It'd be really hilarious if it wasn't so sad. We really don't fit as a couple, but he tries to spit out googled facts to show me that he too can sound smart. It's so pathetic. No one cares what's going on with *me*. And as long as I more or less function and pay my rent they don't have a reason to question if everything is okay.





My mom has multiple sclerosis and I always thought I could die in peace when she's gone. But nooo, my siblings rely on me way too much. There is no other family member that could help them. This whole family relies on me to keep them together and I don't know how I can get out of that responsibility. I don't wanna just pass on my pain to them when I die. They don't deserve that. But it's really  exhausting to live, being me. Especially with the knowledge that I'll be alone forever, only a spectator to life. I won't ever have a relationship or kids. Who would wanna put up with a depressed junkie? And how should I find out if no one comes close to me? 


Also, I miss my mom. We do talk on the phone almost every day but it's more me being there for her. I learned not to overshare as stress worsens her symptoms. So, my closest friend and ally has been taken away from me by this illness. There is no one else who loves me unconditionally and would wanna support me through all this. 




In any case, I thought about making all arrangements for my funeral beforehand, now. So that at least those things are in order for whenever I'll make a split second decision. Has any of you brought your affairs in order, just in case? Maybe 25 is too early, but considering I didn't wanna live when I was 6 it's long overdue. 




I'm sorry for rambling & shitposting, but I've been hanging around in bed since Friday, alone, either sleeping or crying and needed to vent. I'm aware I'm at my most pathetic and I hate myself for it. So please refrain from pointing out what a whiny piece of shit I am bc I already know. Thx for being here. I'll be trying to find money to get some heroins to console meeself.   🖖 hope yall are well and safe! <3",1520338652.0

After reviewing my DM I decided the story was worth sharing with the rest of you. Enjoy.,"**DM** That shit was epic and as I am a fellow resident of _____ where the dog is always one crags list click and text away (actually more like one hundred when all your connects are out town and you are sifting to find the post that seems ""legit"" - with the number of click checks being inversely related to the time between sniffs/shots/drags/etc). 

I digress - just wanted to praise you for your work. Obviously, this dm probably seems quite rando but someone posted about how the sub is almost at 50k followers (def not a karma sloot move only b/c of the joy it brought me and hopefully others). I digress again - but the point being someone reminisced about that competition which took me to the best piece of writing I've found on the internet since our boi Donny T hijacked the ~~fourth reich~~ white house). 

I've been out of work for a week on ~~an unannounced vacation~~ sick leave as I try to pretend as though the this is all in my imagination (completely rational thing to do - you can't tell me otherwise). Long story short I was on a business trip last week couldn't bring my doggie with me on the plane cuz I'm a puss / did not realize how desperate I would be 36 hours later. Two days in the sweats and the ~~rock whale turds~~ shits started to hit real bad and I had to immediately book the next flight home at 430 am and miss the last three days of my work trip - by the time I left the hotel my asshole was a crater from the aforementioned baby turd that was two days over do and I thought my tv was talking to me for a solid hour (for context this process began last Tuesday after I'd already skipped the first day of the trip on Monday and curled in a ball in my hotel room (also puked everything I ate that day on the bed which was pretty much only chocolate nut pretzels needless to say that combination probably painted a poor picture for the hotel staff so I left a hefty tip seeing as they probably thought that the puke was actually dukie from one night stand with a hooker that specializes in acts such as the dirty Sanchez ..... and I haven't even mentioned the scene at the toilet). 

Since then I haven't not been back to work and I've just been texting in sick to my manager everyday last minute and then shutting off my phone with the thought that if I can't see his response it never happened (can you confirm if that works - you wrote the new gospel so you seem like a good person to ask). I totally don't work in an industry where that is acceptable and I'm dreading going back to work (as I stated I too am from ___ so if I'm gonna go in tomorrow aka today I would be getting ready in about ~~1 hr 48 minutes~~ 1 hr 19 minutes). Anyway reading your erotic rhymes made me feel a bit better through the dread that is now surfacing after a week far from reality. I ~~Now am~~ was in the process of getting high as fook on the doof (daer sdrawkcab) - those last three words are scrambled for some mind masturbation to start your lovely day). 

One last thank you and I sincerely hope to hear back from you. **End of DM**

I don't have anyone to really vent to right now so I made this account in hopes I could find comfort in this community...

Well, she caught me.  It's completely breaking my heart seeing her cry.  But, I'm too numb to cry myself.  I am sick to my stomach.  I feel horrible, and I'm definitely not proud.  I completely understand her being mad at me.  I lied.  This wasn't a small secret.  But it is kind of killing me that she can't be more understanding.  It's hard to just turn away forever once this shit comes into your life.  She has no faith in me right now and that hurts.  I didn't relapse to hurt her.  I relapsed in a moment of weakness.  I wanted to escape my life because honestly, I kind of hate it.  I'm depressed.  I'm constantly having anxiety attacks.  But a little dope helps me hide.  I can kick the shit out of the toughest days when I'm high.

She flushed it all down the toilet.  I still have to get through my work week.

Mine would mostly be related on being treated humanely when taking an opiate, more specifically Suboxone. I realized that while i may be dependant on opiates, i am addicted because i am dependant, and i do not have the mindstate of an addict and do not want to classify myself as a drug addict or drug abuser. 


i hated AA and NA for their reasoning to reinforce their opinion of what they think that you should be and how you should act and operate your life. I disdain the government for forcing what we can and cannot put into our bodies . And a few more things that i wont get that deep into at the moment but i hope that you do.

Now, our feature presentation:


I told Cliff that I'm not buying dope this coming pay day and was met with no resistance. For some reason I expected him to try and convince me to commit to buying dope. I'll still pick up his script as previously promised and he's still going to give me two roxy 15mg's for my effort. + he's willing to trade me a 15mg roxy per a Suboxone strip. Of course, if I can only get the pills... we'll see if he's still interested.


Initially I told him I'd be happy getting nothing from him that day, but if he really needs subs then I'll get him four or five of them in exchange for four or five roxies. I certainly can't expect him to give me cash for subs so better off getting paid in whatever is readily available. If he don't want the subs I'm getting,then I won't accept the roxies he's offering me in trade.


&nbsp;

From there... I thought about buying a drone or telescope but then I had another brainstorm. The original bullshit reason I gave him for not being able to buy dope this week was to have money to pay for a $300 certification. Well, as it turns out.. that certification does indeed cost $300. Might as well get fucking certified. I've been meaning to do that for a while but I just kept postponing it in lieu of pot, and then pills and dope.


&nbsp;


The only thing Cliff said aside from general acknowledgment of my plan to get certified was ""It's gonna be a rough week from Thursday until the following Thursday."" Since I'm not planning to tap his supply of roxies and I'll even help him get some subs as long as he has something of equal value up front, I don't think it'll be a rough week for him.

If he does finish his subs and pills prematurely, it's not my problem. 

&nbsp;

**Funny fact, one which may rightfully get me lambasted:**


In the past when it's Cliff's pay day I've been paid in dope to make an ATM run with *his* card. I never took it upon myself to memorize his card number but of course I memorized his PIN to be able to withdraw money.


On two occasions that were months apart, I had to send Cliff to the ATM with my card on pay day to buy dope. He would take out an agreed upon amount and then I would come through on my lunch break to pick up my dope and partake in ripping a couple of bags.  As a result of those two occasions, **Cliff memorized my card number.** For a while this didn't cause any problems so I left it alone.


&nbsp;

On almost every one of my pay days in recent time however, as I wake up and drink my coffee while waiting for the direct deposit to roll in, Cliff would call the automated bank hotline to check the balance on my card. When the deposit rolled in, Cliff would call or text me to inform me of the amount. From there I would tell him how much dope I plan to buy and then I'd make my way to the ATM to get the cash.


It felt a little creepy that Cliff was checking my balance for me but it was convenient.

&nbsp;

THEN, on a couple of more recent occasions Cliff would ask me if he could order food on my card and would offer to pay me back in pills. When he still had pills during my pay day, this was not a problem. Of course if I said ""you can spend $30"" he'd spend $32. Then another time he said ""If I spend more than 30 this time, I'll give yo a fourth pill."" Well of course that time he spent $42 though I guess I can't be a stickler since my $4 breakfast sandwich was part of that order and he still gave me  a 4th pill, a $40 value after paying for his $38 in food.


**Nonetheless**, it creeps me out that he can and does check my card balance. Especially in the middle of a pay cycle. There was one time he ordered food and I didn't even know until two days later. I had to review my account history to pin-point it. When I texted him about it he said, ""yeah, you said it was okay."" Which I most certainly did not since it was $30 out of my last $50. He of course did pay me back in pills a week later but that doesn't replenish my cold hard cash for the preceding week. 

&nbsp;

More recently, I got a second debit card. Upon getting paid, I transfer a lion's share of my money to that card. So if Cliff asks me if he can order food, I can say no without being guilted for contributing to his mom's starvation.

A couple of weeks ago he caught a glimpse of my new debit card while I was racking up a line of dope and said ""do I need to memorize a new card number?"". Motherfucker, no! Well, that's what I said in my mind. Verbally, I told him it was an invalid prepaid card or some bullshit. Since then I've made sure not to let that card see the light of day in Cliff's house.

&nbsp;


Of course I can lock him out of my direct deposit card by changing the pin or eliminating that card but then if I need him to run to the ATM in the future on my behalf, he would get the chance to memorize my new card. So for just a little longer I'll pretend all is hunky-dory but obviously if I continue not to buy dope on pay day with Cliff as I am planning this week, that card will go the way of the Dodo. 

&nbsp;

In the mean time, I'll get paid, then I'll immediately transfer money to the card number he doesn't know so that when he checks my balance, he'll get the perception that I can't loan him any money for food because I'm broke. All the while the money that I plan to spend on tech certifications, a drone or a telescope will be safely stored on in an account that he cannot see or touch.

&nbsp;

 
#Phase 1
**Stop spending money on pay day to buy dope with Cliff.** If I was to spend money on dope this pay day and let Cliff middle for me, I'd have to buy dope for him and myself. So if I wanted two buns, I'd only get one bun for my own consumption. If I wanted Four buns, I'd have to buy five buns because there's a discount and then I'd still have to share half my order with him.

Sure, he'd pay me back for the part of the order that I got for him but he would not give me cold hard cash. He would likely give me some pills and some dope a week later. No, thank you.

&nbsp;

I'm excited about phase one. Now that I have that in the clear, I have one more option in addition to tech certification, a drone or a telescope. 


I can buy myself dope with my friend Tim (not to be mistaken with Tom). Tim will not scam or rob me. Furthermore, if I buy dope with Tim, I don't have to loan him half of whatever I buy. I could literally buy myself a small amount of dope and then still have money left over for a drone, a telescope or a certification. Whereas, if I bought dope with Cliff, I could not do any of these things.


Not the best idea, but I have it in the back of my head so that I **do not** get the temptation to buy dope with Cliff at all on pay day.",1520313403.0

Like when u actually manage to get some sleep? I went to USA on holiday to meet my parents who had come from Australia for my bday and stupidly didn't bring enough gear. My girlfriend got me Unisom which is an OTC sleeping pill. I took like a handful of them one night and had this crazy dream/s. First I was in like Afghanistan or something, trapsing thru the desert and came across this town where all the kids had no arms or legs, turned out there was no food and the adults were eating these kids arms and legs to sustain themselves. Still tried to score there, eventually got my hands on some dodgy looking shit then I woke up (typical). 

The next part of my dream, somehow I'd made it back to UK and I was with my middle at some council estate. Kano (the grime MC) was there doing heaps of meth and trying to hit me with a steel pipe for some reason. Anyway, again I eventually got on and tried to catch a cab from UK to USA before my parents noticed I was gone. I woke up really confused thinking I had stashed a wine glass that I was using to smoke gear beside the bed. It was really disorientating.

I really hate doctors. Especially my last two experiences.
Needless to say, i am prescribed Suboxone and have a very substantial stash of codeine

Phase 1 of my plan was to detox suboxone down to 1/16 of a 2mg tablet,
Then transition to very lose Codeine or Dihydrocodeine 
Until my pain levels out
At which point i would continue using Codeine and Dihydrocodeine for pain relief and Buprenorphine itself in a mega-low doseage (i.e. 0.2 mcg or 0.4 mcg )

and transitioning back and forth honestly in seek of effect of pain relief.

If i can get my Suboxone down to a low enough amount, quit, use a different opiate for pain,
Then if i absolutely need it, use Suboxone again, it would most likely obtain its pain killing effects rather than just other effects that do not manage my pain. most likely due to being on buprenorphine specifically for over 10 years straight

I just wanted to update my situation for anyone who may have caught some of my desperate pleas for advice on here. Anyway, I’ve been “trying” to get clean for the past 5ish months, but I’ve also been chipping here and there whenever I’ve been able to get away with it. Well, that time has come to an end as I must begin Outpatient services at the beginning of next week. So, obviously I have been full on obsessed with having “one last hurrah” with my frienemy, lady dope. Here’s where things get hella complicated...

I live an hour (approximately 50 miles) away from the nearest big city, which is where my 2 d-boys reside. (Yes, I only have 2. I’m a loser, I know. Ha ha ha.) It’s always been a pain in the ass, but I haven’t had access to a vehicle for several months. Thus, living in the country and working in a small city (which is still an hour away from the big city, and doesn’t have any public transportation to take you that far) has made copping damn near impossible. 

Now, over the past few months I’ve had some “luck” with either, paying a shit-ton of money for a taxi (which was $200 ONE WAY), randomly getting hooked up with the ONE Uber/Lyft in town (which is magical as it’s frequently nowhere to be found), borrowing a co-workers car (which I had to be stupid discrete about), and my d-boy actually let me send an Uber to bring him to me and take him back home a handful of times (which he has adamantly refused to do any longer.... I honestly don’t think he would do it if I offered him like $400 for one fucking bundle at this point... craziness, right?).

Anyway, all of these routes have been straight up dead ends for the past week that I’ve been trying. Which makes total sense considering this was my last chance to use for quite awhile (hopefully forever, honestly), so why would things work out in my favor, ya know? After these all fell through, I actually tried several other different ways to get something, ANYTHING to work. I won’t go too far into details about those other plans though for certain, needed   reasons. LOL. Of course those were all dead ends too anyway. Of. Fucking. Course. 

But, FINALLY, today my junkie ass was smiled upon. I got out of work hella early, and there was an Uber 10 minutes from me willing to drive me into the city, and my d-boy was actually good and ready for me!!!  (The last time had a ride set up to take me to the smaller city I work in and then an Uber AND Lyft both magically driving around said town, my dude told me to come through but 15 minutes later said to “Hold up, bro.” because he didn’t have any fucking dope and wasn’t gonna get more until later that evening, when I no longer had a ride into the smaller city!!!)

So. Ya’ll. I finally got my “one last hurrah”!!! (Of course as we’re walking around shady back alleys in a rather hot area of the city, my d-boy takes my money for a brick, hands me 3 bundles and says “I got 2 for ya the next time you come though.” What. The. Actual. Fuck. Whatever, it is what it is.)

Anyway, I’m currently happy and high and chillin’ like a villain. I just wanted to say, THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who took time out to analyze my situation and give me a bunch of terrific advice and ideas. AND to those of you who simply sympathized with me and gave me many beautiful words of encouragement. There truly are a shit-ton of awesome, amazing, smart, sweet peeps in here. And I have SO much love for yinz wonderful people. 

Thanks again, ya’ll! Stay safe out there. Much love to you guys!

Put down the opiates but drank at least a fifth a day til i was 27, when i began getting sober.  I got some real time and each relapse began getting shorter and shorter.  Finally got 18 months and had a job paying 600 a week before tax.  Thats not much but its something i never had and I was very proud and finally financially stable... two months ago they let me go.  For the first time in my life it wasnt my fault, they gave me a severance package and all those that mattered promised to be strong references... still hurt like hell though.

I applied lots and within a month got a second interview and I did splendidly.  They made a formal offer for more hourly than I have ever made, health insurance, 401k, and lots of room to grow. This was it, I finally had a chance at a career.  I waited to be scheduled for training, did the urinalysis, and fingerprinting.  The only thing on my background is an OWI 9 years ago and they knew about it.  They said it would not be an issue - misdemeanor, old, and no jail time.  Except there was... a little... jail time, that is.  I popped a roxy and failed a urine screen way back then, it wasnt even a habit to use on probation but all the same, I was caught.  I did seven days for that.

What I didnt know was that it mattered.  What i didnt know was that counted.  I was called today and thought I was going to get scheduled for training.  Instead they said my offer was no longer valid, the jobs gone.  

I was going to get healthcare.  I was going to get my first suit.  I was going to get pride from showing others my business card....

82a3un,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/82a3un/strange_preferences_anyone_else/,14,https://redd.it/82a3un,oxywhy,"Strange preferences, anyone else?","I've tried a few drugs now, and I feel as if I don't like what most people swear by, but on the other hand, I love what people tend to say ""has little to no effect"".


For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone do *almost nothing* for me. I feel a little bit of a head rush, they work as actual painkillers and everything, but overall I wouldn't say I feel ""high"" or even euphoric. On top of that, they both cause horrible constipation for me, so I avoid them unless I need them for a medical reason.


I thought this was weird because from what I've heard online, these are both supposed to be great highs, yet I get almost nothing out of them.


On the other hand, I've had Codeine, just 30mg tabs, and I **loved it**. Super tingly, and euphoric, even just talking to other people gave me this wave of pleasure. In fact, I'd probably say Codeine would be my drug of choice, if I could get my hands on more.


Compared to hydros and oxy, it was night and day. Even a couple grams of Kratom gives me much more effects than ""stronger"" opioids. 


To be honest, I'd trade oxycodone or hydrocodone for Codeine or even Kratom any day of the week. Which isn't an opinion I've seen *anywhere* online. 


I still have yet to try Morphine, which I think I might like, because Codeine is mainly just a morphine prodrug, but I have trouble wrapping my mind around not liking oxy for example, because it's supposed to be stronger than morphine.


My question is, has anyone heard of/had similar experiences? Also, is there a biological reason I might not be receptive to certain opiates? Thanks :)

A suggestion....not exactly what you think!,"So after talking to someone about NA, etc. I thought of something, why not form our own group, called OA, based online? We basically follow the 12 steps, but we don't take that hardline approach that can scare addicts.


I guess the difference is, I think we as a community, could help each other out, those who want to stay clean, or those who just want to stay alive. This isn't a sobreity only group. 

This is a quality of life group. I want to improve our quality of life, individually. If you use opiates, we should help you with HR, not turn you away or chastise you. 

You'll quit when your ready, and when that time comes, we will be there, but we don't want to be pushy. The main rules of the sub will be followed, i.e. no sourcing etc, the crap that comes with operating a private chat.


I feel that NA can be a little harsh and scare others away. My intent, is this is a bridge, or so, to ease people who may not be comfortable with NA, to give it a shot.


Honestly, I thought NA was bullshit, but I gave it a shot this last month, and earnest shot. I don't really believe it all, and I still find crap in it I don't agree with, but I can't deny it. 


Something positive is happening in my life. Is this a good idea? I was thinking something alongs the line of a chatroom like r/trees has. Maybe this breaks a rule on here, but I looked and nothing suggests this.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Insults?


**TLDR: I want to make an all-inclusive group, of users and those who are clean or trying to get clean from opiates. Even if you have no urge to ever get clean, you can join. That's the premise. Yes kinda like this sub, but more....focused on taking active steps in HR**


 Because this group is about harm reduction and improving quality of life (and maybe segwaying into NA, but we don't want to push their doctrine). No coins/tags, no counting days, the only thing we care about is ""how is your day, are you okay, safe? If not lets talk about it, I think a lot of us have had really shit days, and can help someone else get through it.  

Like say you're having a problem shooting up correctly, this is a place you can come for advice with no judgement. And if you want to get clean, we should be there for each other too. I know people who are using, find hope sometimes when they hear others getting clean, and it may effect them down the road.

I just feel, NA is lacking something, whatever that thing was, it kept me away from attempting to reach out to people who were willing to help.


Any of the mods want to weigh in?


For some reason I feel there's a huge hole in my plan, and this is horrible lol, but I'd totally be down to learning how to run a chat and stuff. Maybe I just dun smoked too much weed today, and think everything is a good idea.

I am interested to know what your withdrawl symptoms are, some experience all and some experience unique and also just certian symptoms but harsher.

I have never ever been sick when in withdrawls, when most say that is the most common, my most common symptom in severe goosebumps and no appetite.
The sleep and wake in 1 hour soaked is horrific that is my worst symptom by a million miles.

Tonight I have managed to feel 70% better and eat a bag of Haribo, 1/4 cheesecake some McDonald's fries and some noodles.

Do you think I could awake tomorrow with no appetite again and restart the process? Or do you believe when a symptom improves it improves for the duration of the withdrawl?

I know I am waffling, I am just trying to understand the chemistry and the kindling effect of these withdrawls, it's such a unique and horrific experience, the worst flu you could get is alot better than this, due to the none mental aspect that lingers.

I have been snorting .5mg or suboxone every few hours to take the edge and this is day 3 of my detox.

I have 3mg of suboxone left now, do i even need to 're dose to try sleep if I am not in need? Or should I save it for tomorrow, or maybe just use like .25 mg before bed now?

(communicate my intent not to buy dope with Cliff on pay day),"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;
________________________________________________

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520283089.0
