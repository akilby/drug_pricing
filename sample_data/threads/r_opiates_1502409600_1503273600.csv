-That the medication will take several weeks to work no matter what it is (had this said to me about a klonopin prescription, speaking of..). 

-That benzos are prescribed to people on a daily basis..I know the need for anxiety meds I have some myself but it's absolutely not a good idea to put people on benzos every day, unless they absolutely need them. Otherwise you're just making people dependant on benzos and make anxiety worse in the long run!

-That the most common ""starter"" prescription for suboxone is 2 8 mg strips..I know some people need higher amounts but telling someone off the bat to take that much is only prolonging the process by putting them on more sub than they need ~> has anyone actually done the 8X2 as prescribed for Wds doesn't it make you sick?

-The treatment of opiate addicts..my friend had to come to me twice because he sought help for his dope habit and the e.r wouldn't give him clonidine for the withdrawals, or anything besides Zofran. He's an addict of many substances and usually has to come to me for the get well stuff since his doctor is a POS

I know Doctor is one of the most well respected jobs in this country and it's considered a prestigious honor to have completed all that school..the problem is I feel they don't want to learn abou on going societal issues like addiction and just go back to their text book instead of looking in the patient in front of them.

He talks about his brother in law who is a heroin addict and has no sympathy for dude. There's too many peeps that doesn't use (at all or anymore, i.e. my family members and close/oldest friends) that stigmatize opiate addiction whether they don't wanna admit it or they say it loud (n damn proud- chyeah man! Sarcasm.). If u used to use and actually don't stigmatize opiate addiction (I can name a few of u on this sub) you're awesome and there should b more ppl like you in the world. Okay, I'm going off-topic. Focus!:

What if your boss caught you using, or found out you used to use/somehow figured it out, or suspected? Would u make up an excuse or break down and spill your life story? 

I've contemplated what I would do if this happened. I've done stupid shit while on the clock (I've taken too long of a lunch break before, been too tired to do anything) and wondered what kind of stupid explanations I could continue to give if he really got on my ass. He's actually super lax about a lot of shit, I'm really fortunate. It also sucks too though cuz he gets too emotional and takes shit personal sometimes with me (got pissed when I said I don't wanna leave my job bc I still need health insurance- I have  gastro issues and obviously need to continue treatment for my addiction, but I never meant it as a threat like he took it lol).

Or if your boss suspected something was up with you, would you answer all your boss's questions or would you get defensive because it's private and personal (do u even HIPAA bro?).",1502451670.0

But let me speak my mind. Also, this is only a solution for the physical withdrawal effects. The PAWS come after, but my solution covers them as well to a degree.

If you want to come clean, this is a good, painless way to get over the first physical effects at least, because, well, you don't feel much when you sleep, don't you?

**Step 1**

Look for a (legal) clearnet research chemical shop.

**Step 2**

Buy clonazolam - that shit will put you right the fuck to sleep. It also got extremely good anxiolytic properties, but is a very addictive drug itself, so only take it for as long as the physical withdrawal symptoms last.

**VERY IMPORTANT - DON'T MIX WITH OTHER DEPRESSANTS LIKE ALCOHOL OR OPIATES! IF YOU RELAPSE, WAIT UNTIL THE CLONAZOLAM WEARS OFF AGAIN. OTHERWISE YOU RISK AN OVERDOSE!**

I got 50 mg for 30 euros and a knockout dose is about 1-1.5 mg for me. If you withdrawals are bad, you can dose more, but please be safe.

If you chose to order it in powder form, I'll explain below how to make a solution out of it. Most vendors sell it on blotters, though. I recommend making a solution, because you need strong stuff and not weakly dosed blotters.

**Step 3**

Assuming you now have clonazolam solution, you're ready to start.
Make your room comfy. Put some water and food near you. You often lose track of time when knocking yourself out with this stuff. When the withdrawal starts, take the clonazolam.

The plan is to basically knock yourself out, until the worst symptoms are over. This also means you won't be functioning **AT ALL** while on such high doses of clonazolam and you won't even remember a single thing you did while you were on the drug, but the physical sickness symptoms will be gone.

There of course will still be craving, which is the worst, but since the clonazolam is an anxiolytic, that will definetly help to take the edge off as well. Dose lower after the acute symptoms are gone, though - maybe 200 - 400 ug. That way, you will remain a functioning member of society. I listed the dosage chart below.

**From powder to liquid**

If you don't already have a 0.01 or 0.001 g scale and propylene glycol laying around, this step will cost you around 35 bucks.

Once you gathered the supplies, weigh how much clonazolam you actually received in the mail. Let's assume you got 50 mg.

Weigh out as many grams of propylene glycol as you got milligrams of clonazolam. For my example, I weight out 50 g of it.

Now put the PG in a resealable jar and add the clonazolam.

Shake that bitch until the solution looks clear and everything has dissolved.

You now got 1 mg/g clonazolam solution.

**How to dose**

Get a glass out of your shelf, put a little bit of water in it, put that bitch on the scale and press tare it until it shows zero.

Before each use, shake up the jar for a few seconds. Now, suck up some of the solution with a syringe (or eye dropper, pipette, whatever works) and drip it into the water until the scale shows your desired amount of solution.

For example, if I wanted to dose 500 ug of clonazolam, I would need my scale to show 0.50 g. Understood? Good. Of course, you would dose higher to get some sleep. I recommend 1000-1500 ug.

**BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DON'T START WITH THAT MUCH. START AT MAYBE 500 ug AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS OUT. DOSE MORE, IF NEEDED.**

Now knock yourself the fuck out and forget all about the physical symptoms.

**Dosages**

Threshold: 50 - 75 ug

Light: 75 - 200 ug

Common: 200 - 400 ug

Strong: 400 - 1000 ug

Heavy: 1000+ ug",1502444865.0

I've been getting the Oxy 30mg IR pills for many years; however, I was originally introduced to them 12 years earlier when they were the 80mg. And of course at that time, the time release could be removed by simply licking off the outside coating. I miss those, but I digress. 

I always assumed that best RoAs for Oxy were (in descending order from most effective to least effective):
IV (intravenous)

IM (intramuscular)

Rectal (Boof it bitches!) <-- I'm new to this subreddit, but this sounds like something the ODB would say.

Insufflation (Snorting)

Sublingual (Under tongue)

Oral (Self explanatory)


I am fully aware that those RoAs differ depending on the drug., I also know that some drugs must do first pass metabolization before it can even cross the blood-brain barrier.

Vyvanse is a good example. It only turns into amphetamine once it reaches your lower intestines and is metabolized. So snorting Vyvanse is extremely ineffective because it only takes affect after you swallow the drip and it digests which takes much longer than just eating the son of a bitch. It is better to just eat the damn things.

If the drug is not water soluble like Xanax, then it also is not a good candidate for snorting. Ok, I totally went off on another tangent. Let's get back to my question. 

I always thought snorting oxycodone IRs had better bioavailibility than eating them. This was a bad assumption 12 years ago, and for some reason I didn't research it then like I normally do. I love to know as much information about drugs as I can. 

I've been wanting to try some H, because I have a high opiate tolerance, and it is super expensive. But I cannot find a plug. Until then, what are some tips for increasing the ""rush"" or the bioavailability of Oxy. Should I be putting them under my tongue? Boofing those mofos or what? I usually do 8x 30mg Oxy IR at a time. It is too expensive, so I'd like to get the most bang for my buck (pun intended... bitches).",1502444685.0

I'm literally waking up everyday and fighting back tears until I go to bed. There have been 2 times that I've gone on trips with my family (in the car) and as we're leaving town both times I began to get a panic attack and  both times began crying uncontrollably. 

Let me go ahead and tell everyone what I take on a daily basis, and hopefully someone can help. 

Obviously Suboxone (Started at 10mg and have Tapered down to 6mg)
Zoloft (200mg)
Adderall (Don't take a consistent daily dose and haven't really been taking it bc summer. Been taking 60mg XR this past week to try to get my body re prepared for it before school starts. Am prescribed 90mg IR and 30mg XR daily)
And I smoke a blunt or 2 every night.

IF ANYONE HAS HAD THIS HAPPEN WHEN THEY GOT ON SUBS PLEASE MESSAGE ME. My doctor is telling me depression is not a normal side effect from suboxone, so maybe I'm just a small percentage? Or maybe the suboxone has nothing to do with it? Not sure but I need help. I go to a highly demanding school in Boston and can't afford to be like this for much longer.

PS- not sure if this info will help, but my ""opiate addiction"" was never too serious. Never used needles and never had an addiction last more than 4 months. The first time I got addicted (May-August 2016) was mainly fent analogues and in my relapse (Feb-May 2017) I was mainly using street dope.

ive got my chipping down to every couple months now, and this week I decided to take a little vacation from life and did a little 3 day binge with some norcos i had stashed. i would say even though i dont use every day, and have done only two of these 3 day binges since march, my first-pills-of-the-day-binge tolerance is still 80 mgs to feel half way good. the days proceeding it goes upwards to 200 mg

my first day i did a CWE on 120 mg...figuring id lose 20 mg in the process (a huge overestimate) id think my solution would have at least 100 mg. it definitely didnt feel like i took 100 mg, especially 100 mg all in one shot, after not using since the middle of May. it felt like 60 mg at best. what the hell? my second day i decided to start the day simply eating 8 whole pills incld the APAP and i felt a LOT bigger of a buzz from that, than I did with 40 mg more on the CWE

today ive consumed 180 mg via combo of CWE and a couple straight up pills (washed the whole pills down with the CWE shot lmao) and i feel nice, but nowhere close to what 180 mg would do to someone who doesnt use daily

am i possibly losing a lot on my CWE? i figured i have it down to a science, been cold watering my norco and perc 10 scripts for almost 14 years. im very patient, even do one or two re-washes on my left over gunk after the first extraction. i use room temp water initially, allowing for maximum extraction via the water temp changing from warm to cold. i dont think i can improve it at all

i believe tolerance is somewhat of a lifetime thing, but its been almost 3 months since my last little binge (and I went 3 months before that one too), my tolerance couldnt be THAT high? i also take a relatively small amount of Kratom daily, im talking maybe 12g over the course of the entire day. but i stop a full day before i start my binge and dont use kratom on the days i use the hydro

whats the deal? am i losing a lot on my extractions? does hydro really just suck that much? has kratom given me a perminant tolerance? unfortunately hydro and perc 10s are all i have access to (stocked up on old scripts, but they're not expired. less than a year old). i was looking forward to this little treat and it was a huge let down! i'm trying to give myself 90 days between these little treats...didnt quite make it to 90 on this one...but it wasnt even worth breaking that clean time. what a fuckin letdown. i think next time im going to skip the CWE and just eat them and follow up with a few weeks of NAC and beet juice. you guys dont understand how much i was looking forward to this lol",1502399447.0

So, i don't post here an awful lot, i don't to pill porn or show off my stash of meds that i take... and i know that i've made some confusing and conflicting comments here that may have upset a whole bunch of you...

Every day on my way to the gym that i train MMA in, i see needles, homeless people, people nodding off on old blankets... sometimes i buy them coffee or something (i dont give them money because i've been told im only feeding their addiction)... i mean, shit, even as i'm writing this im under the influence of some codeine (only 60mg, not alot, not a big user). 

After lurking here for a good few months, and posting here and there about codeine and my liver scares (which is fine btw, livers a little fucked, an enzyme that is meant to be <40 is like, 67 or something)... I've come to realise that you're all human, humans who have lives, i may judge quickly when i see you guys with heroin or something, and i think ""stupid junkies"", but i know its more then that, it's people who have either been stuck in a cycle, or are getting over a traumatic event (whether its mental and/or physical, in my case, physical, until the hospital decides that now is a good time for surgery). You're all human, with friends, or family, who love you... I am unsure if family know of the habits, and you may keep them a secret for a reason that i won't dig into... but you're all human, and this subreddit is just a support group in a way, like a massive family, who share images, who share laughs, who share thoughts and who at alot of the time, shares love... or dope, probably, idunno.

I apologise, because a week and a bit ago, I lost someone who i knew from school to a heroin overdose... he was one of the nicest people i've met, when my dad was overseas, i was left with no money (fucking ninja bills man), and he bought me pizza, came over, and we watched UFC together. I can sort of say that his loss has opened my eyes to how heroin can take someones life so quickly...

Please, users of /r/opiates, stay safe out there, don't over-do it (i cant stop you if you do, so... idk, do as much as you want), and if... and this next bit is completely optional since i don't know many of you guys stories... but, if you havent spoken to family in a while, give them a call... my mate ran away from home to hide his addiction... his family is broken because of his loss

If that were the case they would just go through the pain of withdrawals and then live clean, feeling the same as they did when addicted to dope but without the expense, sickness, etc.

Really grateful for insights. ",1502396405.0

I understand that vast overprescription of Oxy, etc caused this. But now it's not so widely overprescribed right? I'm not in the US so I don't really know if this still continues.

Theoretically this should affect a generation, those who were prescribed opioids and graduated to heroin. Then it should die out.

But it isn't, it's propagating and the demographic of users is becoming younger and younger.

Did this just reach critical mass? And if so when is it going to get better.

My girlfriend is going through heroin withdrawals right now and it's one of the hardest things I've had to see. I can only imagine how painful it might be for her. She really wants to shake it this time, but realizes that she can't do it on her own cold turkey. We set up a time to go to the methadone clinic and sign up for a program, but it sounds like they only accept patients that actively have opiates still in their system. The appointment is a few days away and we're afraid that she'll be clean by that time. 

With that in mind we've been actively looking for a small amount that will push her through until the appointment comes around, but we can't find anything at the moment. My question is can she still get into the program without anything in her system? I mean, it sounds kind of fucked up that you have to actively be using in order to be accepted, which means continuing use until the specific day that they take new patients in. 

I'm really scared and I want to take her pain away and make her better. She needs help and right now it seems like everything's working against us.

Unbeknownst to her I am a heroin addict. Over the months we have warmed up to each other and talked more and we finally let our guards down and talk more openly at work. I talked about some non profit work I've done involving addiction and she talks about why she stopped her nursing career due to stress. Eventually this led into a discussion about the opiate epidemic and huge number of deaths across the country. While smoking out back during a break she opened up and admitted she lost her brother last December to a heroin overdose. She talked about fighting for custody of his daughter and how numb she is to death now. She said she doesn't understand how somebody could enjoy opiates because all they do to her is make her near unconscious and sick. I retorted that for an addict it's a completely different feeling and extremely difficult to understand even more so to let go of. She said that now her big brother sits in an urn on the mantle of her living room. She said she's so overcome with anger she picks up the urn and wants to throw it and break it when she has a bad day. She says she misses him so much and is so angry he died it changed her entire outlook on life. I gave her a hug and teared up because standing there listening to her was a huge reality check that my addiction could do this to my family. I have a younger sister and our relationship is strained because of my drug use.

I honestly feel like this stuff feels less addictive TO ME than alcohol. I stay away from alcohol completely now.

I have just discovered the joy of opiates at age 31. Benzos have been my drug of choice for my most of my life. I just like to to kick back and relax on a Friday and take 4mg of Xanax and some beers after a hard week of work and kind of drift off into a weekend of naps and Netflix.

I have the last three weeks been taking Oxycodone (my first opiate) after hearing about it for a long time and I really, REALLY like the effect (don't worry I'm not mixing with Benzos).

Is there a physical addiction risk with taking 20mg once a week? I know I will probably sound like an idiot asking, but I just want to be safe. I went through Benzo withdrawal 5 years ago (after 3 x daily usage) and it was hell.

Also Oxycodone makes me really sleepy for a couple of days after is this normal?

Will that get better? Will the methadone help with that? Also, does methadone get you high? Nothing like heroin, obviously, but does it make you feel good? It's not making me feel good at all because my tolerance is high and I'm at a low dose.

Also since tomorrow is Saturday we get take homes,, I take 25ml which I barely barely feel at all. Anything I do feel is likely placebo. I'm thinking about doubling it up and going to 50mg with my take home.. I know its abusing it but I'm pretty dead set on doing this.

He had me running around. Said his roommste would hold some brown. Ejt couldn't he? He knew I wss coming??guy is not there. But I wait 30 mins in the hallway on am SRO anyway.

So he brings me all over the ghetto to get to his guys place. The guy is carrying arpumd 10 ozs cause he's paranoid. He finally uses my money(100..owe him 30) and some homeless girl's money(40).she waited behind saying ""I want purple!!""

So the dope smelled like fucking candy. Maybe even purple candy. Smelled wayyyy too sweet.  It tasted bitter AND sweetish. It fucking mixed up clear!!! Not brown or amber but clear!  Which scared me.  With his last bag he had multiple kinds. He said sorry about the pink. Offered me a free point. 

With the last bag. Tan. Dark grey. Sprinkle of pink the former two tasted great. ..like heroin. But this new stuff was gummy..which I always had god luck with but it's greyish snd snorted monkey water wasn't nearly as noticeable as before. Is fent hard to use this way? ?

I snorted some but noticed little. I then shot a weak shot. 

When I shot it there was a rush and soon after I fell asleep. I woke up and puked. I've been affected all morning. But I'm not numb or blissful. I would love to say I'm high but I'm not even numb, not even itchy. I shot heroin for 4 years. The best dope was off white, chunky and reeked of vinegar. The other amazing dope was hard browm pebbles. 

I have no tolersnce to speak of atm. My pupils are pinned. He talked about this being less cut than something I liked but more fent.

I felt like saying WHAT IS THIS FENT CUT WITH, HEROIN???

Now he says people downtowm are so fent crazy that he'll trade me. So I give him what seems fent heavy snd he will give me a gram of actual brown. He claims that this stuff is more exoensive. Thd brown is 100$ less per ball. He knows that if I can get good dope he can pick up more often and I'll pay his prices. 130 for a gram.

How fent heavy does this shit sound?

He said I got brown from him before. Tan? Sure.  And that what I have now is like the first bag I got just more cut and less fent. This stuff has more fent.


I'm a couple of pay days away from getting on the Dark Web and reading reviews. Can't I just get mostly real heroin? Have things changed this much? I was seeing pink shit at the end but most of the dope didnt smell like candy and mix up white! !

I need to get groceries and go to the bank to get cash to pay the other hslf of rent.

He's willing to meet me on the train to trade this grey super fent?? For brown...probably tan if I'm lucky. 

Doesn't heroin always mix up amber?  I've never seen something mix up clear. He thinks people are so fent crazy that giving this opened bag back to him and getting brown would be worth it.

Should I even meet him on the train or just accept I got too much fent and snort monkey water??

Please give me feedback and advice. 

I need to go out for food and to the bank.  I feel like saying if it doesn't st least mix up right dont bother. I know dope doesn't have to smell like vinegar but it shouldnt smell like candy and mix up clear! ! Right!!??",1502469336.0

A few times during a hangover or whatever I woud take the hydro/tylonal mix for obvious reasons... I never felt any pleasure...

That and the fact that I'm a young small white girl who looks completely out of my comfort zone driving through the hood. 
Anyway has anyone successfully gotten the price of their dope lowered and if so how? Simply by asking? Telling him if he didn't you were going to leave? Saying you found another connect that's cheaper and if he can price match?

2. Does smoking/vaporizing leave a strong smell?

But my spidey senses were alerted early and I called dude and said I'm coming in to ur place cause boys.. He huffed and puffed for a sec but agreed cause we are pretty cool and known him for years. Well cop doesn't leave for a while..hes waiting us out..so we are stuck essentially.. No dope if we leave but I have a few warrants and one or two are felony warrants so I can't have no contact with them what so ever and my boy is on probation still for his possession last year so he might be in trouble either way too. We debated thinking what to do for a min like if we could sneak out on feet somehow but no go..entire complex surrounded by huge bushes, security fences , and various other shit. Cop knows all this obviously and is patiently waiting for us to get back in car to leave.. And at that moment we had a pretty clutch idea.. We are about to uber our white asses up out the jects. Order uber says 7 minutes away and we watch him drive to us on app. But alas we still cant just jump in uber infront of the boys so we have to sneak in front of the only building around blocking us where cop can't see us.. Uber rolls up we hop in quick as hell and proceed to drive by the cop... So needless to say we are shitting our pants going by and for a few minutes after waiting for him to come Rollin after us.. But somehow he didn't see us in the uber.. I think he was hardcore eagle eyeing our ride in the parking lot and didn't notice us at all. So we have uber drop us few miles away and wait for a while until dboy says that cop finally gave up he must have decided it wasn't worth his time.. So we wait a little longer to be safe and call yet another uber to take back to car in the jects... And offer the uber $20 to follow behind us on way out just in case cop somehow tried to get slick and wait somewhere if he's behind us he will pull over uber first and maybe? We will get away still. Thankfully cop had just gave up and we got out fine. Scary close call almost was sitting in county for awhile again.

TL;DR cop had us cornered in projects we out started and uber'd out that bitch while he watched our car.",1502594334.0

Hi fam. I just wanted to talk about being incarcerated and then start using shortly after being released, even though there was significant clean time and I did not have the intention to get out and using again.

Here is my experience on this situation and I would love to hear from other felons who got out and started using or from anyone in general who hasn't gone through it but might have some insight or opinions on why this happens.

So last year I caught my first felony charge of possession of a controlled substance for getting busted with tar. I got bonded out and went to my first couple of court dates, while still continuing my 1 and a half years of daily dosage of H. I live in a state that is pretty intolerant when it comes to drug charges, so even though I did not got caught with a large amount at all, the deal that the court was giving me was supervised probation with 5 years of state penitentiary time over my head. When it came to the date of my sentencing I knew I was going to be placed on probation and therefore would have to stop using so, being the strung out dopefiend that I was I decided not to go to court and left the state so I could continue my binge...

6 months later I am brought in on my out of state fugitive from justice warrant that I had and I go through proper hell dope kicking while I was being housed in this county jail in the state that I fled to from my state. So I finally get put on transport to be extradited back to the state and county that I ran from and get there after about 18 hours. I have no bond so there's no possibility of that. I get a visit from my public defender and he lets me know that since I ran, the deal that I was given was no longer on the table, and he lets me know that the most likely scenerio was that the judge sentences me to 365 retained jurisdiction which means that I have to go through the department of corrections to go through a prison program which takes about 7 months to complete and then once I complete it I go back in front of the judge and they take a look at all the notes that the facility I was in have prepared to show the judge how well or poor I did there and they then decide to let you out on probation at that time or impose the rest of your prison term. So I do a good program there, had a inmate worker job, and didn't get much disciplinary actions against me so when I went back to the judge he granted me probation.

I was released July 28th, 2017. During my time being locked up which was almost a year, I gained 80 pounds and had gained a more positive mindset on maintaining sobriety. The day I got out was a good day, my mom bought me new clothes, a phone, and paid for my first months rent at a halfway house (She did all that for me despite of how terrible of a person I became in my addiction, I am truly blessed to have her). So the first day waking up as a free man was a very weird experience. I hit a wall, hard. Was overwhelmed by a sense of complete emptiness and sadness. For the first time I was aware of exactly how much I have truly lost. My relationship of over 4 years, my house, my cars, every single possession that I used to have, all of that was gone. The entire time I was locked up, I was disconnected with the outside world, so those losses did not really affect me. I was genuinely happy on the inside. I had a routine, I worked, I was surrounded 24/7 with some very solid friends who I became close to, I basically has no worries. How can I be living in an institution like that, and be genuinely happy and comfortable and then I get released and all of a sudden I am confronted with these terrible feelings of depression, guilt, and emptiness. How can this be? I had no intention on falling back into the drug life whatsoever before I got released. Yet days after I walk free I am smoking crystal and shooting up heroin daily, which brings me back to a complete state of contentment. I only have to see my PO once a month, which I had no idea of when I decided to go on the run last year. I feel like I'm given just enough rope to hang myself with. If something goes wrong and I catch new charges or my PO finds out I am using and decides to violate my probation and send me back to see the judge then I could be imposed to finish the rest of my sentence which is around 48 months. The bizarre thing though, is that I am not even very afraid of that happening. I don't understand what is wrong with me and how I completely had a falling out with myself so fast. 

Is there anyone here with the same struggle or knows somebody that does? Or does anybody have any input? Would be more than happy to hear your responses and talk more with you about this issue.

I had been to the drug house many times in between but only the front rooms with my buddy Mark (the original connect i had here for weed and hydros). He lives here with his girlfriend, and they sling out of their bedroom. A shitty, smoke-stained room right to the left of entering the house. I would stand restlessly upon the concrete floor with my flip flops (how i never lost a toe from biking in them so much while high, I'll never know).¬† Now Mark's weed was always shitty Mexican bricks, but he knew the people i needed to go through to get pills too. He found everything from oxys to valiums to gabapentin to shitty flexeril I scoffed at. When will people realize not all downers are fun or euphoric? 

However, I'll give the kid a break. He's just a young pothead who hangs out with the wrong crowd. He grew up in the projects with parents who weren't really there. Such a sadly typical story, huh? I remember he always like me ever since i used to visit the projects in a Xanax-induced haze to pick up, you guessed it: more Xanax or roxys/opana if i were out or lucky enough to find more. After making our transaction, Mark's neighbor and I would smoke a slobbery joint (he always did this. Young stoners..) with him right next door afterwards. Anyways to keep a long story short this is how I met Mark. A year or so later I met Dan through him. 

---

Now, moving forward to the night in April or June or whenever it was when I tried IV opana for the second time.¬† A nice writer I saw recently mentioned how severe addiction is analogous to traveling through different dimensions. Honestly that is how that six month period of my life feels. I thought it was only due to a drug induced haze, but could it be something more, something visceral? Like our souls being raped. 

**Beginning of summer, the day I became a junky:**

It was a day just like any other. I can't lie and say i even remember it in particular. I mean it was my second time, not the first. I can remember some of what was going through my addicted, expertly rationalizing brain.¬† ""Oh I went months in between it last time. Same thing this time!"" I was so certain I could chip with IV use. I mean people online do it all the time! Why have I been wasting 50-75% of all the drugs I've ever consumed over my long, and chaotic, yet slightly romantic descent into oblivion. 

I grab the plush mountain bike my mom had bought for ""us"", and tell her that I'm going for a little ride. She takes another long pull on her menthol cigarette. She says, ""okay baby. Be careful"" and continues rocking in her chair on the porch where she spends many hours (well if she even has time). Off I glide, out the blacktop driveway and up the hill past the curb, just out of sight from my mom. I pull my phone out now and call Mark's (aka the house phone at the drug den). Dan answers. This was unexpected. ""Hey uhh... is Mark there?"", I ask hesitantly. 

""Yeah sure. Hold on..""

¬†""No, wait.. I actually needed to ask you if you could help me try the same thing as last time"" 

""Yeah, you still got your rig?"" 

I didn't, but he assured me it would be okay to find another one. I hang up the phone as I roll on past the car wash where I normally meet plugs. I'm already shaking from nerves and excitement. I am gonna feel that rush again! I had not forgotten it for even a second even if I told myself at the time I didn't care. It didn't occur to me that I was in fact already obsessed. I pedal at a frantic pace that even the hobos gave me strange looks for. My thighs burned as I passed the assisted living towers in midtown and began the uphill climb up some shoddy concrete walkway. I used to skate down this sidewalk for fun, now I'm biking up it for drugs. 

I think briefly about the good old days but am quickly interuppted by the sight of Dan and Mark's car (well old lady's car they borrow) pulling out of the backroad. I see arms flailing out the side motioning me to get in. They explain it is now or never on the opana situation. Mark jumps out and helps me stuff my bike in the backseat. I hop in the middle, riding bitch seat as we make our way back the direction I just came from.¬† ""Lenny falls asleep at 5PM sometimes so we have to hurry"", explains Dan. Looking back there was always a hurry if he was not well. That's another thing I liked him for. He never bullshitted around time wise. Most of his guys didn't either. 

As we cruise through town in a busted up old Honda we discuss drugs and women and money. Dan said something which always stuck with me. Something about men only needing two things: dope and a woman. Then he said with enough dope we don't even need her. At this point I wasn't enough of a junky (and foreveralone) to agree, but I saw his point. He had been divorced from his wife and separated from his kids so long the oxymorphone was the only warmth he ever felt now. 

Now, we're almost to our destination as we turn left before the car wash by my house. Next we turn up a steep hill going back into woods a little bit. I had never been up this road. It's a dead end with a couple secluded homes at the end. An optimum spot for a drug dealer. No one could see all your traffic from the main road. So the first time I visited Lenny's I wasn't supposed to go inside. I slide Dan my 25$ giving him my complete trust in this moment. My wellness relies upon him. I knew he wouldn't fuck me over because he was smart. He knew getting in good with me meant more dope for him. I wait in the front seat with Mark but he gets out too. He is bullshitting with some guy on the porch but I'm still instructed not to get out.

After a few restless minutes Dan returns with a tiny chunk of a yellow e series opana pill. ""You're going back to our place to do this right?"", asks Dan pointlessly. He already knew my answer was yes since theres no way I'm snorting this pill and can't shoot on my own yet with no supplies. We drive carefully back home on backroads as we discuss my latest money making scheme of selling Pokemon cards online. They were appalled i made so much this way. Up until now I had only sold the duplicates. Boy would that change fast. I noticed right away Dan's seriousness about being careful. He had never been arrested or even close to being in trouble. I could see why. He is a silver-tongued devil and very paranoid. He always hated driving with needles. Shit, who doesn't? It becomes like second nature in time though. I always had that thing tucked around my waistline like a second cock. (Well, at least it was useful!)

I think how tortuous this conversation is becoming just because I'm so sick and anxious. ""My nerves are killing me"", I blurt out. Dan assures me not to worry. He says all my worries and fears are about to be a thing of the past. Hell, he's right.¬† He just forgot to mention I would be taking on a whole new level of worry: literal obsession with pushing chemical solution through my veins, which got to the point where my entire human structure was molded to suit this need. The term autopilot applies here.¬† I felt this word pop up so often in the back of my mind, up until the junky (on junky steroids now) jumped up and blocked it like the NBA star he was. 

Finally we are pulling in the short, yet packed gravel driveway in front of our little filth den. We jump out quickly as possible. I realize Dan still has the pill but i am not worried.¬† Mark and Dan go in the front. They tell me to go in back. My heart then drops for a second in that emotionally fragile withdrawal state. I still hold strong. I creep to the back door and see Dan begin to slide it open for me. The toaster is already warming. The pill coating is being wiped off. Dan reaches for his marked rig in the collection of used rigs. He grabs a fresh bag and hands me a new one. Now he begins to teach me as he pulls the marshmallow roasted yellow pill chunk out of the toaster. He hands me a cup of warm water and says to draw up 100 units. He has me squirt it on the burning hot pill, and I hear a sizzle, signifying the endorphins already beginning to fire off in my brain. He shows me how to flip the rig over and mix with the bottom part of the plunger. ""See how it sticks to it? We dont want that. That's dope."" I realize that much, but I still smile like a madman and nod in agreement. I keep smashing this goopy, solid pill matter until it is all a syrup. It looks and has the consistency of maple syrup but with a raw burnt chemical smell I can't quite recall *or*forget. 

He takes an already prepared cotton, pre-wetted, and places it on the end of my needle. ""Now draw it up"", he says sure of me. I shakily do so as I see the goopy liquid syrup slowly leak into the syringe barrel. Even with a new rig it takes a while to suck up a fluid of this consistency. Now strangely for the first time I realize (was in denial till now) how wrong this whole process is and how these are not meant to be abused, especially in this way. This thought is so transient as the barrel fills and my veins start to come out from hiding. Actually they usually were popping out, albeit wet from sweat after riding my bike so hard in this humid mountain weather. I worried about infection briefly. I wipe my arms with an alcohol pad or my shirt. Not sure which it was that day. 

Danny looks at me sternly and holds out his hand. I hand him the syringe and hold out my arm. ""Don't I need a belt?"" 

""Nah I can hit you. You got good veins."" 

I once again gave this fifty year old junky, (once an average and morally good man) my full trust as I stare intently at the shot of dope in his leathery, tan hands. All the years of running around and working in the sun for a pill had made his skin this way. I could read his character from the tracks and abscess scars on his wrists and hand. He goes directly to my biggest puffy vein on top of my right arm. It is just asking to be punctured and violated. I shake a bit as he insists I be still so he doesn't hurt me by missing. ""It kills me to miss on someone else, so be still."" I can't relate to that guilt, but I see the guilt in his black eye. Also the stubble on his cheeks and the weathered grey hair on his head told me he was being genuine. 

Finally, I feel the poke of the fresh needle's tip. So subtlety sweet, like the color of the blood that followed, which plumed into the barrel of dark brown oxymorphone solution. My death wish had been certified, as I close my eyes in orgasmic pleasure the instant he pushes down that plunger. 

Mother morphine wraps a perfectly warm blanket around my neck and torso. She tickles my toes with pleasure and assures me everything is alright again, if even for a moment. The rush becomes more intense as she leans closer, whispering one word in my ear: ""relief"".",1502582292.0

...

if you're waiting to dose your subs, you should wait until you're in moderate-severe withdrawals. typically you should wait as long as possible, 24-36 hours just to be sure you don't go into precipitated withdrawals. because once you're in them, there's really no getting out of it. you just have to ride it out. & once you do decide to dose, start low. 2-4MG, increase the dose later if you need to. the first few days could be rough, but you won't be suffering brutal withdrawals. 

...

& for those asking about ""*i've been on subs for (x) amount of time & skipped a day or two to get nigh, when can i dose again?*"" 

...

the answer is you can safely dose whenever you decide to. you still have bupe left in your system from the continuous intake. it's not completely out of your system, so you don't have to worry about going into PWD. you can even take a tiny piece of sub while getting high, just to make sure there's some in your system so when you switch back to strictly taking bupe, you have absolutely no reason to wait or worry. 

...

i really hope this helps answer most of the questions about bupe that are asked week in and week out. at least 2-3x a week, someone asks about when they can dose, how long they have to wait, or what's going to happen if they've skipped a few days to get high. i've been on bupe for a long time, and i've learned as much as i possibly could about it, so i'll share all of my information here with you guys, and hopefully it'll help cut down on how often the same questions are asked...

...

& just for those looking to get high on bupe, because they're not addicted to opiates, less is more. 2MG and under is the best for ""recreational"" dosing. sub 2MG doses creates more norbuprenorphine. which is closer to a full agonist. you get more *feel good* from norbupe than you do taking a full dose of bupe. also, if you don't get high often and you want to abuse suboxone, please start small. bupe is actually really fucking strong. 1-2MG doses can and will make you sick. instead of enjoying your high, you'll be hugging the porcelain throw gurgling your favorite color over and over again. blaaaaaaaaaaaack! haha. 

...

anyways, i hope this helps someone!",1502574814.0

Your heart is irregularly existing. Sometimes it's so crazy you wonder when it will return to normal. Later you forget about normal, eventually you block it out

Weird how little you remember over time, might feel like you've slipped through dimensions. 

You don't have hobbies. Those are too time consuming, besides, motivation to be part of society goes extinct. 
You look out for you.

Depression, impossible to described, mostly unpredictable yet in tides. Days no longer exist. You no longer exist. The future doesn't mater because you've already subconsciously accepted this will be how you die.

2. Does Medicare put a note on my file that I was an opiate addict / substance abuse history , that other doctors can see ?

3.

""The down seen on now adays is all fent your lucky to find h in your stuff. People want fent""
Ok. Lots of dope is cut with fent but lucky to find h? Surely it hasn't gotten that bad. Even the cops here say over 50% is cut. Some people say it's all fent now. Much is cut but all fent? Come on.  

And people want fent? A few do but the majority surely still want heroin...right??

If you just want to answer the question please jump to the line of ""stars""*** below.

I feel like this is obvious but I'm building connections again and after meeting a dealer downtown, and a few times on the train,  the biggest bag I got from him seems like heavy fent. Sometimes I wonder if there's any heroin at all. I'd love to do a drug test before its gone.

Dripping monkey water from the bit I made tester shots with was not like the rush of his first stuff. Smoking it gets me a little wobbly and goofy. Super pinned pupils. When I injected it I got a massive rush and passed out too quick to really tell much. He said he would trade it back for dope that seemed more balanced. 

His first bag got me really high when I dripped the water up my nose and changed the colour of the water. I've never seen dope mix up clear and while I thought that was a red flag others have said it cam happen. Aside from pharma pure heroin I thought all heroin would look like amber liquid or light tea colours. I'd love to hear some opinions.

I know that the fact this dope smells like candy is not a good sign. I'm pretty sure good heroin never smells like candy. I'm sick of waiting to trade and I might mix up a huge piece and try dripping the water in my nose again. I wont shoot anymore of this dope. The rush was good but I passed out scary quick.

I'm looking forward to getting some dope from my old town thru a friend. Idk why I ever went to the ghetto to meet people.

You can get pure (as in active ingredients) heroin.

Pure fent (any analogue you wish)

Or heroin cut with just enough fent to increase the rush.

Which do you get and why??
THANK YOU.

I just can't believe most people want fent. Most people want heroin and greedy dealers went from just upping the rush to removing too much heroin.

I've lived in different cities and all I've ever done is cop off the streets. I must have liked it. Yeah. I always liked it. 

A couple of crackheads approached me outside a 7-11 on Halloween. One of them was selling a tool belt. He went from 50 to 5 in a dip, but I still I passed on it and hit them up for a dope connect instead. This is when I was just a big, green, dumb, fresh-faced, know shit wankstain, getting ready to paint the town black.

Anyhow, they hop in my ride and direct me several blocks up. One of them says I can't come with, but of course, and asks me to let him walk with my loot. Now, I may have been a big, doe eyed, applesauce dribbling dolt - but I knew that was a no go and told them as much. But - in all their crackhead ingenuity they provide a solution. One of them would stay in the car with me. This was a special occasion and I just had to come through for the squad. Okay.

Know when you know with every ounce of your gutty wuts that you're getting fucked but you do it anyways? So dude in the passenger seat was going to go fetch while I was to have - as collateral - the dude with the belt in the back seat. As the minutes ticked by it occurred to me that, well, what was I going to do with this schlub? Hold him hostage? Take a pound of his flesh? This crackhead made for unwise collateral.

So of course, but of course but of course - tool belt doesn't know what's what and what goes on with his homerocks and he doesn't know nothing about nothing, doesn't even really know this cat, doesn't know how, doesn't know what, doesn't know the color of the moon or the shape of his balls. 

""I asked you and you pointed me to him. This is on you!"" After a few minutes of loony bin banter between us he hops out the vehicle. I go after him, still arguing. He still has his tool belt on, grabs a hammer and starts swinging it at me. Remember how I said it was Halloween? Well, I was dressed as - fucking Dracula. I'm in the hood, deep into the night, going Russel Crowe with a crusty ass, hammer wielding crackhead dressed as - fucking Dracula. The Cape, the Eddie Munster hair, the whole kit.

He takes a couple of swings. I sidestepped it and I was getting pissed off. He sees that I'm not backing off and decides to reach in his tool belt for an upgrade. A screwdriver. Dumbshit. This was my chance. Barber shop bib cape floating in the air - I pounce and throw his ass on the concrete. He looked so pathetic begging me not to hit him. I let him be, surprising myself more than anything seeing as in how I was ready to abracadabra that screwdriver in his ass seconds prior.

I didn't get to be the hero for the crew. This is when we were all just starting to experiment and finding dope meant you were king of the fucking north for the weekend. By the way, this was for $10 - another reason why I was willing to risk a thousand to crackhead not pulling crackhead moves odds. You could sooner tell me that my ass was a rose garden than you could even suggest that I wasn't invincible when I was 19. 

I went to visit my Mom the next afternoon and before I leave she wants to know why there's a butcher knife in the backseat of my car. Damn. Glad he decided to peel and not Joe Pesci my ass with the steel. Funny thing is, if he would have presented it from the jump I would have made him an offer for it. It was quite decent. But he said nothing of it and I realized it wasn't for sale. So all in all, taking crackhead prices into account, the night only put me back $5.",1502720621.0

Of course I cannot come along because I have my outpatient class to attend each day. That doesn't bother me, because I could use some time to myself. In addition to the outpatient class, I have a ton of work to catch up on. 

But then as Friday is approaching, I'm already subconsciously planning my relapse. I told my boss I was going to outpatient for major depression, and he seemed compassionate at first, but that was about to change. A side note, I've worked for the same employer for almost 20 years. Every year I've consistently received promotions and / or raises, and I've always received bonuses increasing in value over the years.

This year has been challenging. My boss knows that I have been having marital problems at home and depression, but I did not mention any ""chemical dependency"" issues, since that holds a much larger negative stigma, and he is a normie that doesn't get addiction.

Anyway my boss noticed I kept pushing up the release date for a component my team was working on up a few weeks. It is due to me coming off all my medication at once, all the arguing at home, etc. This is the first time, I haven't come through in 20 years. And we have not failed, we are just late. On our last project, I was understaffed, and I pulled a bunch of all-nighters to make the deadline. Well you really are only as good as your last transaction. I got put on a performance improvement plan anyway. Said I had to have all the work done by this morning. 

So you're damn right I picked up 100 30mg IR Oxy and have writing code non-stop all weekend. But I feel like a dick, because I had to buy a few bottles of synthetic urine for outpatient. Halfway through group therapy I started nodding. There is only one other heroin / opiate junkie in the group. And she knew what was up. Everyone else thought I was tired from working all night. I was lit for sure. But I came prepared with my fake pee. I feel like a dick, because you have a group of people trying to get clean, me included, and I'm basically in ""fuck it"" mode getting lit in front of the poor girl kicking H.",1502717173.0

Unfortunately, I'm working 10 hours a day washing dishes in a kitchen and I've been having to pick up (always waiting on the man, fucking late every time) then run to work. As I spend my bus no way on junk, I'm having to inject then RUN 3 miles to work. It's an insane situation I've got myself into. Although, I've become incredibly fit as a result! Damn my cardio is the shit right now!

Anyway, I've decided. It's taken most of my life, but now I'm sure. The one fucking thing that upsets me more than anything, it's being patronised. I can take insults, idiots, irritating people.. but people that judge my intelligence and speak down to me puss ne off more than anything.

So, I'm at work and I'm told to make a side dish to go out to the restaurant (let's not get started on the fact my job is washing up, but I've also taken on making stuff when the chef can't be bothered, cleaning everywhere over and above the kitchen, fixing electrical stuff in the bar like setting up the TV so people can watch sports in the bar.. it's endless. But whatever, I'm at work, I'll do what I'm told).

Anyway, so I make this dish and the manager takes me to one side and says 'it needs just a bit more cheese on it. Now, if you look at the wall over here, we have pictures of what the dishes should look like. Try and make the dishes like the pictures. Can you do that for me dear?'

I wanted to break something.


I left work 45 minutes late because I was told to mop the floor 4 times. Apparently it wasn't good enough the first 3 times and they made me try a new mop heaf,. Whatever. They treat me like dirt. 

Also, talk about health and safety violation.. the main oven doors in the kitchen is held together by a fucking paperclip because they're broken. Yesterday it swung open and the metal door about 300F burned my leg. You won't believe this burn mark, I have a perfect branding of the oven door handle on my thigh.

I woke up and went to the doctor this morning to try and put together a detox pack. A couple gabapentin, some sleepers, some benzodiazapines. Anything to get through work and 3 days of pain before I try and soldier through the rest.  DENIED. The doctor looked at me like a piece of shit. That patronising tone I got from the kitchen manager was all over this woman's face. I can't give you anything , I can't help you. Any suggestions then? Go to the drug clinic (I did. The choice is Methadone, or fuck off).


Addiction is a real issue. I tried to tell her it's a mental illness, that I want to quit, I'm ready, I can do it with a nudge of help, but the first few days are awful and trip me up every time. Are a few valium going to kill me? She told me I'd be swapping one drug for another. Well of course I fucking would, that's the point dipshit.

I walked out feeling like I'd been dumped, dejected, rejected, a failure, miserable. Stuck in this routine of using and working for the foreseeable future. I hate doctors, I hate the system. Where is our help? This crisis is t going anywhere if people that do want to quit can't even get the help they need. Basic drugs. Basic essentials.",1502711420.0

Pic of a mixed up shot and prob the inside of the bag coming soon. ^_^

So... ^_^  The same dealer that went on and on about how getting me real dope is a ""waste of my time"". ""Cause"" (-verbatim and close to verbatim statements follow-) there's no h left.....  Dealers without fent loose their edge (ok..so a little fent to up the rush? ..nope
 He means zero heroin) no one wants h anymore it's too weak for the people down here, no one wants it. You're lucky to find heroin..NO ONE WANTS IT (Spoken like someone with a vested interest.) Yes... People want to do your ""rush enhancing cut"" as a standalone high....as tho they're about discerning as computer duster huffers...F.F.S. Heroin users aren't known to be connoisseurs of hedonistic pleasures.... Riiiiiiight.
-_- Faaauuuck.Reeeaaally. ?

So he also tells me getting regular heroin (that's how much he's corrupted me..over the week, I've been calling actual heroin ""regular dope"" or ""regular heroin"") is too much work. He admits he took my 100, a homeless girls 40 and a couple bucks of his own and picked up 7 grams of ""dope"", which he led me to believe was regular dope..but the homeless girl demanded ""purple"" fent and he got one bag. I ended up with what seemed like a gummy bag of pure fent with little to no heroin. And I told him it's ok. I will give him enough for 1 to 3 grams a week. He can give me teg dope and use my cash to keep his own thing going. Surely then its ""worth it for him"". I just want some decent dope. A fucking week of this shit. Being super nice while he acts like he doesn't give a shit about my needs or hard earned cash.  He said the brown is 100 dollars cheaper a ball. But then bitched about not wanting to deal with people he doesn't usually use. Saying people only want fent so he's better off buying dope that's strong enough cause heroin is too weak.  As tho he doesnt understand quality dope. As tho strong fent is more ""powerful""cause based on weight it will knock you out. Nevermind the lack of euphoria. 

So today I was willing to try another batch - I was just hurting.. I was going evto pick up kratom and would be close to his place... tho he'd basically told me even when he could get actual heroin he probably wouldn't have done it. Cause he just gets it at cost instead of making a bunch of cash. I get that!  but I even told him I would toss him some cash for helping me get real dope.  For a fucking week he's been trying to make me feel like a fool wanting actual dope. Saying my money is a waste of time even if he puts good dope aside and usesmy money for his scamming.  Telling me real dope is a waste of time. That when he used my money ""I got way more dope that what you guys gave me"". 

So I'm waiting on the corner. A homeless girl offers to sell boots. No thanks. Another asks if I'm waiting for Kimny. No. Do I smoke rock. No. I tell her who I'm waiting for and ask her about this bar dealer. Ask if she's allowed to see her. She is but insists she knows someone better. She uses a free phone at a women's center and we walk thru an ethnic area of town with a culture that makes me think about opium and dope.

Meet a guy.
Sheepishly ask for his number and say I'm trying to build new connections. He's got his nunber written on little strips of cardboard. It's all light tan chunks like the bottom of a big bag of gummy dope. It looks right. It smells right and it tastes right. 

When I smoked a little bit I literally moaned like I was having an orgasm. I was loud.. neighboors probably thought.I was jerking off. The girl who helped me meet the guy said it was genuine and the best stuff down there right now. 

I've been waiting months for dope like this. No 3 for 50 etc but when its this good that's ok. It's got a rich euphoria and pleasure profile. Unlike the feeling of a very narrow,chemical, opiated feeling from the fent heavy dope I just had. I'll need to pay 100 per half gram but there's no fent or buff that I can see.

This is how it should be. The other guy told me I better pay him 100 or else. He waited around for 10 mins. He told me my money was a waste all week. Sold me fent heavy fent dope...And I owe him 30 measly  dollars. I told him if he threatens me again he'll never see me. I calmed him down. I'd say stay on his good side but when am I going to need fent heavy dope or pure fent passed off as dope.

My money is a waste of time anyway. So I'll pay him back and leave him alone. But he pushed me away. 

I'm so happy with this shit.
I'm going to get a gram on Friday  ^_^

She is a long time addict; somewhere between 5-10 years of IV use.  She has had many infections and abscesses before, and all of them were taken care of with essentially a rag, a knife, and maybe a little antibiotics (if they were available, otherwise she just squeezed them and ""let her body take care of it"").

But these are bad.  One is literally almost the size of a tennis ball, on one arm near the bicep.  On the other bicep is another that is about the size of a golf ball.  She has small skin infections elsewhere as well, but nothing like these two insanely dangerous balls of bacteria waiting to kill her.

She has the chills intensely, is extremely tired, seems confused at times (sepsis or fever?) and is scaring me beyond description.  She **refuses** to go to a doctor or hospital, and says that it will come to a head soon and once it pops she will be fine.  Days have passed since the fever/chills started, and she has become significantly more fatigued. 

I don't know what to do at this point.  I haven't known her long, and our relationship falls under ""friends with benefits"" at the most.  I am in no position to demand she take care of herself.  

When I explained the risks, pulled up Wikipedia, and discussed it with her, she basically told me that she doesn't care if she dies.  This is a wonderfully kind person, and she deserves a chance to get out of this homeless junkie lifestyle (which I lived for many years) and be the happy, healthy, and amazing person that I know she can be, but right now she is asleep in my bed with a fever and a ball of death on her arm, and I don't know what to do.

Any ideas?

EDIT:  I've tried calling everyone that I know for spare antibiotics but nothing has come through.  I may go to the doctor myself but I don't have any skin infections and wouldn't likely get anything that would be helpful unless they were understanding of the circumstances (which they often are not when it comes to addicts.


**UPDATE:** So I promised to buy her a half to go to the hospital and I would give it to her after she came back (I have no car and couldn't go with her due to obligations) and after nagging over and over she said yes she would. She left a few hours ago. I'm hoping this means that she will actually keep her word and make it there. She would not take an ambulance. I didn't grab her last name before she left (like I said, we've only known each other for a few weeks and we're just friends, weird to ask junkie friends their last name) and she doesn't currently have a phone, but she does have my phone number, so I'm hoping for a call as soon as she gets through triage/initial treatment. I hope they give her some pain meds, because she fucking deserves them.

I'm hoping she didn't just leave and go score somewhere else, but she really did not understand the severity of her situation. It would have been an huge invasion of privacy and trust to take pictures to show you guys, or I would have. You would see my concern.

So now I'm just waiting. I am really hoping she will be back here first thing to pick up her dope and show off a nasty scar and a gnarly story. 

Thanks for everyone's concern and advice.

6tjvaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6tjvaq/fuck_the_fucking_hospital/,33,https://redd.it/6tjvaq,InfectedNeedle,Fuck the fucking hospital.,"So I got osteomyelitis or an abscess on my bone from
IV drug use. When I first tell the doc I'm on Methadone he says cool
he'll give me my dose as well as access to morphine. All is bloody awesome until they randomly cut off morphine access. Turns out 45 mg isn't enough to stop my w/d thanks to a half gram of Morphine over four days ontop of it. So I complain I'm w'ding and the doc is nice enough to up me to 60 as it turns out one of the antibiotics increases Methadone metabolism rate. So even at 60 I'm still at a 5 in withdrawl scale after 12 hours. So the doctor has the bright idea to split my dose into 30 at 12 hour intervals. So now instead of a solid 6 hours of relief a day I'm getting maybe 4 total and IT IS FUVKING BULLSHIT. They're giving me 7.5 mg norco every 4 hours which is fucking laughable considering I've been on Methadone 5 years straight at atleast 45mg plus 50-60 grams of
heroin ontop of that. Seriously do doctors not understand drug tollerance or do they just not care?",1502681334.0

I guess it's like that because almost every damn dude in that complex sells so I guess that rule makes sense.

I ignored all his calls, even called from a different number to throw me off. Then sent me the text telling me to lose his number.

I also have had many problems with opiates, im an ex heroin and morphine addict at many times the 2 drugs overlapped and i am lucky to have not killed myself.

All my friends had basically resigned themself that i was just an addict and where expecting me to die because of my recklessness and my feeling of invincibility was scary to watch i have been told. I had accepted death and was hoping for it often. My drug use spiralled even further at this point to injecting ketamine, speed and mdma along with the heroin and benzos, how i survived i dont know blind luck i blame.

I thought life was as low as it could be but then I lost one of my closest friends to heroin in april this year, he had a loving girlfrend, a house, a career, a life everything i wanted but i was too wrapped up in drugs to chase or even care.

I just wish he could see me now. I made a promise to get in control of the drugs when i saw him on his deathbed, i can never forget that promise it is so deeply ingrained in me now. Now i use drugs in moderartion i have a steady job and a life and mostly im happy with life now.

She tossed it around the room for hours until she passed out. I would try to get her to play with her toys. Nope, not her precious money so she gave no fucks.

Since then I've been periodically balling up random money for her to play with. She had a few ones, fives, ten, and a twenty. And I know for a fact the $20 was her favourite. You could throw all her money into a pile and she would go straight for that damn $20 even if she had to dig for it. 

Anyways, today I was supposed to help a friend cop and obviously get a middling hook up so I was supposed to be alright today. Well, that kept getting pushed back further and further so I figured I would listen to my gut that it wasn't going to happen. So I needed a come up quick on my own.

After shitting my brains out over and over again, I went and bought some lope. Took 8mg and that really calmed my stomach down but these cold sweats, chills, mental fuckery is really crazy! 
Lots of you redditors are going to say, get some subs, get some Kratom, get some Gaba but, I'm the one who did this to my body and I'm the one who has to face my demons unfiltered by WD aids. I want to really *feel* the horrible pains and kick my legs around just so I remember how shitty it is. Seems like as I get older WD are harder to endure. They are scary but heroin is my bitch, not the other way around. It's only a few days.
Also, my gf and I had a all night talk and she knows about my dope relapse and she promises to not touch pot while she's pregnant. She cried, I cried, and then after sobbing into her boobies we had amazing sex (wasn't withdrawing at this point so I had super dope dick). 
Things are shitty right now because of the WD but other problems in my life have resolved. So happy for that.

The physical stuff was never too bad--body pain, shits, bad sleep--I could handle that since my habit was quite small (and my Crohn's seems seems to be holding pretty steady thank JJ) BUT the psychological shit is torture.

I'd almost forgotten about that aspect of my use, I was so grateful for regular shits that the suicidal ideation and depression being gone was almost an afterthought--I thought it was a cause-and-effect of, ""if I'm not sick on the toilet from Crohn's, I'll be less depressed.""  Which is very rational, I've been told that by doctors before.

But it seems my depression is its own beast.  So what the fuck do I do now?  I have very poor access to health care, so even if I wanted to getting on SSRIs, etc. would be a pain in the ass.  Getting on subs equally so (and not sure I'd want, may as well just use heroin, it wasn't that it was going badly for me, just this government crackdown).  Been doing all the right stuff for dopamine too--been working outside this week, getting lots of sunshine, interaction with friends, eating healthy, etc.  Just as soon as that's gone, or even during, the dread is just back with a vengeance.  I can deal with it some, I had coping strategies before dope, but fuck, that's why I turned to dope anyway--perfect life anesthetic.

I`ll cut right to the chase, I¬¥m in a Substitution Programme in Germany and recieve 1000 mg of XR morphine a day here. The key worker of our facility told me that it¬¥s time for me to get take home soon which would be a huuuuge benefit for me as well as really rare in this country. Being prescribed substitol (morphine) as is and then even Take Home, super duper rare. Unfortunately, I took some Crack as well as Rohypnol 1mg yesterday, I¬¥d probably fail any UA coming this week. Also, my BDAY is upcoming soon so I¬¥d like to smoke at least one or two rocks. Please dont tell me I shouldnt, I cut back a lot but as it always is, shit like this Comes up whenever you Need it the less.

So my UA has to Show up morphine..Can I buy a clean Urine package and just add some morphine extracted from the capsules? We can go and use the bathroom alone, not sure if there is any sort of trick involved, however I¬¥m sure I¬¥m not the only one using ¬¥passing off fake Urine. If they check for DNA, would adding a small drop of my own urine - small enough for DNA but too small for detection- suffice? OH: test is just a regular Strip test, no lab involved.

 I plan on going clean from today on anyways, I¬¥m just sure it wont last cause the test will probs be end of tis week, start of the next.I usually swallow half every day and IV the rest, a Habit I¬¥m trying to put off, but I¬¥m too scared that I would WD because of falling blood Levels. Been doing this for about 2 weeks now, the IVing.

SOOO Opinauts, my 2Q:

1. would adding extracted morphine (just a drop) to a clean sample work out?

2. What can I expect from switching from swallowing 600mg of Morph as well as IV ing 400mg to swallowing the whole of 1000. And what could I do to negate any lingering symtoms?

THX and good day to all of you dirty Junkie no gooders :*

4. What is cheese heroin? I have been told it is heroin cut with Tylenol pm? Why? To make you sleepy and trick you into thinking it's more potent? Is there a way to tell if you have cheese dope?

7. Bth has 3 and 6 MAM something something (forgot name). I have been told this makes the high and rush more enjoyable. Can you get this chemical raw as in just the chemical and not the heroin? If so what would the high be like if you used it by itself. And what if you added it to ecp/powder.

I really wish I was normal, and could use here and there without totally destroying everything I've worked for.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for everything and everyone in my life, but damn, being sober gets so boring sometimes.

I'm 22 years old. I use morphine (IV) and drink on a daily basis. (Also smoke weed daily but not a whole lot.)

I finally decided to make a separate account for all my drug/alcohol purposes. Anyway this is probably my favorite subject of all tbh. There's just a sense of community and acceptance that's much too scarce on the Internet in general nowadays and I love that. I'm planning on being pretty active here for the foreseeable future. I'm trying to get my fianc√©e (also a fairly regular user, probably an addict as well though not as bad as me) on here but she's pretty wary of social media in general so Idk if she will or not but I'm not gonna push her. Anyway I'll probably post my story of how I got where I am on here as soon as I have time to write it. Also have a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering with a Minor in Biology so any of those type questions I could answer and my fianc√©e is almost done with her Bachelor's in IT Systems Architecture so computer questions I can get answered as well.

My name is Heroine. The wizard, Dee-ee-hey, has done something to the others. Now only I remain... Dee-ee-hey has seized control of the castle and is now trying to destroy the supply. I am in the dungeon of the castle. Please find me.""  
* Point crawls out of bed and opens the treasure chest in the room to find a straw. A fuckin dialogue box appears, ""Point has obtained a straw, he can now insufflate."" He makes his way to the secret entrance of the castle. Along the way he finds Sir Middle leaning against the wall. Sir Middle mumbles to Point, ""Take this film, it's all I have left."" Another dialogue box appears, ""Point has obtained a sub film, it's not Point's favorite but it'll suffice.""  
* Point makes his way towards the dungeon area but notices 12s are guarding the path. He steathily walks from one column to the next avoiding detection. The film is slightly wearing off by the time he ends up the next room. In the room is a treasure chest in which he opens and a dialogue box appears, ""Point has obtained a blade, perfect for cutting!"" He walks to the next corridor to only realize he is lost and the film is on its last legs. He is greatly concerned because he can sense that sickness is imminent. He hastily runs to the next room he sees and finds a flight of stairs. He thinks to himself, ""I'm finally here."" All of a sudden a figure appears from the depths of the stairwell. IT'S PROBATOFF! He ducks behind a crate to hide but soon realizes Probatoff is not leaving anytime soon. Points stomach starts to ache a bit. An idea pops into his head and Point pulls out the blade and slings it towards Probatoff. It hits Probatoff's main artery. Probatoff falls to his knees, vanishes, and then is replaced by a key. Point is perplexed at this moment but he grabs the key and brushes off what just happened because he knows what lies ahead. He expeditiously walks down the flight of stairs and enters the dungeon.  
* In the dungeon, he sees Heroine locked in a cell. He uses the key to open the cell door and Heroine greets him, ""Dee-ee-hey locked me in here and took everything from me, luckily I managed to hide a stamp of Fiyah in my... nevermind where... but you don't look too well... thanks for rescuing me. You can have this stamp......... on front though."" A dialogue box appears, ""Point has obtained .1 of Fiyah (not fire but it's Fiyah)."" Point pulls out his straw and quickly insufflate the Fiyah. It's not really his favorite route of administration but he doesn't have his necessary tools. As Heroine leaves she states, ""If the supply route wasn't blocked, Esco would be able to bring actual fire in. Oh well there's nothing I can do...""",1502750059.0

1. How hard is it really to get into treatment, whether suboxone/methadone, inpatient rehab, etc? Does it vary by city, state, insurance, court mandate, etc? Are there really that many people clamoring to get treatment of their own free will? 

2. Suboxone confuses me. I hear of people using it recreationally, and I understand it contains an opiate, but I thought naloxone displaces opioids from the receptors, so... how is that fun? For that matter, how does it even work? It seems like swallowing the poison and the antidote simultaneously. 

3. I also read about people on suboxone trying to break through with fent. Doesn't that defeat the purpose of trying to get clean?

I get a call at midnight from one of my dboys asking for a ride from one part of town to another in exchange for a couple bags.

I'm insured on my mum's car, so what the hell, I ""borrow"" her key from the drawer downstairs and make my way to pick up the guy. He looks sketchy as fuck, along with some other black kid I've never seen before who jumps in the back, pants down by his ankles. We get underway and he pulls out a pack of cigarettes. I say, sorry, you can't smoke in the car, it's my mum's and she's gonna know someone's been in it if you smoke in here. He goes fucking nuts and protests. Look, what if I lean out the window  No, I tell him again. 2 minutes go by and he just sparks up a cigerette anyway. I told him to get rid of it and he says 'Oh shit. Sorry. I'm a smoker, addicted, ya know, **I forgot**. Fucking bullshit. His guy in the back takes this as cue to smoke too and sparks up a joint in the back. The car fills with acrid marijuana smoke and cigarettes. In my mind I'm thinking I'm gonna have to air this car out for at least an hour when I eventually get back.. which probably won't be long enough to get rid of the smell. Stress levels rise. I fucking hate Dboys. They're below drop outs. All they know is crime, attitude and money. And the money isn't even worth it because they only last a year at most before they inevitably fuck up and get arrested. My local newspaper reported 60 arrests and convictions in my city alone this year! 

Damn. I think.. I just know my mums  gonna know I borrowed the car in the middle of the night. Well.. she did, but it wasn't because of the smell of smoke that's for damn sure..

As we're driving along, the 5 or 6 phones these guys have between them are constantly fucking going. They answer and direct addicts to random parts all over the cit, claiming they'll be there 'in 2 minutes mate... just fucking be patient and hold on'

I now know where dealers are when they say that to you. No where near you!! They aren't ready. They have no gear ready and no intention of being quick. Do they get off on sending sick people halfway across the town? I don't even know why they don't just say 'we're sorting it out now, give us an hour'. Their phones ring constantly 'yeah mate, pulling up now. I'll be with you in the park in 30 seconds fam.' (We are 5 miles away in the opposite direction,) I say nothing .

We arrive at some shady apartment complex. Wait here. They say. 10 minutes. 

I try and be patient. But I eventually crack and call after 40 minutes and continue calling every 20 minutes for 2 hours. Every time the same answer '2 minutes more.. just wait. I'll sort you out properly. I promise.' 

When they finally get back in the car, they direct me - not back home - but to a 24hr garage to buy cling film to wrap up their 'shots'... aaaaand back to the shady apartment. Another 90 minutes waiting. They get back in. I demand my payment before we get underway. He delays, answering phone calls and having a 'chat' with a bunch of people before dipping into his giant bag of drugs and handing me 2 pathetic bags (¬£15 worth) and says he'll give me more if we do a quick drop off. When he 'paid' me, it was from a huge wrap of crack and heroin bundles so I know they've got loads on them. Im trying to concentrate, it's late  I and I hate driving in this city. They keep shouting 'turn here turn here!'! We fucking can't, I say, it's all one-way streets. I already been fined for going down a wrong street a month ago. I swear, the city road system where I am was designed by a drunk committee of chimps. It's awful to drive in.. I tell you. I've been on vacation the world over and hired many cars. My city is still number one in worst places to drive. No joke, its just awful. And there are cameras everywhere - if you make a single mistake, you get fined. We do a drop off to some guy whos been waiting 3 hours on a street corner.. 'Ill give you another bag if you take us back to shady apartment and wait for us a little longer'. I want to go to home to bed, inject the tiny bag I've got and call it a night. But addict brain and the thought of having a little more takes over.

On the main road back there, blue lights start flashing us from behind.  FUUUUUUUCK.

We're pulled over with God knows what shit he has on him. I don't even know the other guys name even. My 2 bags I put in my mouth. 

Usual questions. Where are you going. Then it gets worse. He sniffs inside the car.

Have you been smoking marijuana sir?

Got any identification?

Who are your passengers? What are their names? Where have you been? Made any stops tonight?

I stumble and make up a name for the other guy. I don't even know if Dboys name is his real name.

Police: GET OUT!

They cuff me and search him and find a big bundle of cash on him. They split us up and I overhear the police calling for backup and background checks. They look dboy up and find he's been prosecuted for money laundering before. 

This is getting worse and worse...

They question us all separately.

Then 3 more cop cars arrive with dogs. They take the car apart. Under the hood, the trunk, the seats, glove box.. the whole works. I overhear they found drugs in the car. Oh shit. What have they stashed.  Several grand in wraps of crack and smack??? In my mums car?

OH.. And get this. The reason we were pulled over is because my mum didn't tell me that a week before she had cancelled insurance for me on her car as I wasn't using it as much as she thought I would. So the reason I was stopped was because they saw a male driving the car, registered only to be driven by a female.

She never told me this. It's 3.30am at this point. Police, dogs, cars EVERYWHERE. A stop for an insurance violation turns into a drugs and money laundering jackpot for them.

I get taken to the station in cuffs, I have no idea what they've done with the car and the other two. I'm forced to swallow the bags in my mouth as they begin a strip search and stick a torch in my mouth. Damn.. I was thinking if I ever get out of this, at least I can melt some troubles away with a shot when I get out of this. I'm so tired. It's the middle of the night and it's starting to get really surreal. I wonder if I'm going to wake up.

They dump me in a cell. They tell me due to shift change, it's unlikely I'll be out before the early afternoon tomorrow. I'll miss work and a benefits appointment. My mum won't get her car back for the morning which she needs.. more FUUUUUCCCKK in my head.

The cell is stone, freezing cold and has no padding. There's a hole for a toilet and a shelf to lay on. Oh, and an hour after I 'arrive' they drag in a real life fucking Nazi. I'm not kidding, some skin head Nazi sympathiser is stuck in the cell next to me. How do I know this? Because he screamed anti police chants at the top of his lungs for hours, and hours.. all night. ALL NIGHT. I'm in hell.

All I can think is.. the car is impounded. They're going to call my mother to tell her the car has been stolen in the middle of the night for drugs and money laundering offences, 2 black guys in it and your son driving illegally.

I start having a panic attack. I'm serious - just a week previous, my mother sent me an email telling me in detail how she was thinking of suicide because of all the shit I've put her through being an addict. 

This is the cherry on top.

The screaming anti police and nazi chants continue.. but amazingly, at 8am, the screaming was still going on (FUCKING PIG, CUNT. OI OI OI. WHITES WILL PREVAIL. OI OI OI. FUUUUCKING CUNTS PIG SCUM CUNT. I think it was sung in D Major, but I was so tired an revved up on adrenaline, it was difficult to focus on the musical aesthetics of the screaming!) I am dragged from my cell, bloodshot eyes, no sleep, back and legs fucked from laying on a stone slab. Random thought pops in my head.. wow, that guys throat must have really been sore.

 They drag me out. Hand me a ticket for a road violation and kick me out to walk home. A ¬£200 fine .. and that's the end of it. Apparently they already called my mum at 3am when it happened and she got out of bed and went to pick up the car and take it home. So it was already parked outside the house when I dragged my sorry ass in through the front door.

They hadn't told her about the other people. They only asked if they wanted to press charges against me for a TWOC violation (Taken Without Concent)

The officer had decided that because I didn't fit the profile and I was so nervous, that I was being coerced by these other people that I couldn't name! No idea what happened to them. We were all processed separately and I don't think they were going to be released until interviews and outstanding crimes and stuff had been dealt with. They booted me out the station and considered the matter closed.

My mum was amazingly calm. Taking part responsibility that she hadn't told me she hadn't renewed my insurance on her car. (I had been using it only a month or so before after all)  I told her what the officer said , that I was being forced to drive to pay a debt (she thinks I'm clean) She decided to take my house key and kept me locked indoors for 2 days to check for withdrawal symptoms and make sure that I was still clean.

I did my best to hide the withdrawal pain - but 24 hours later, when withdrawals were about to peak and I wouldn't be able to hide them any more.. I pooped out the well-wrapped bag! Cleaned it off, unwrapped it and banged that shit! Giving me another day of no symptoms. Everyone all around seemed pleased with me and despite a fine. I seem to have gotten away with.. well, everything. So long as these people don't come looking for me. Which I don't think they will, knowing nothing about me. 

I gotta say, it seems to pay to be polite to police. Especially with all the assholes they deal with. They got me out the cell first thing in the morning after shift change. I never sawnthe other guys. They were brought in separately but they must have realised 'one of these things doesn't belong'. They were giving attitude, swearing, being total dicks - I came off as middle class white boy, nervous around cops and had nothing on me at all. I asked if they wanted to strip search me and if I could do anything to help speed things along, as I had nothing to hide (but the heroin in my mouth) I got quite good a talking without a lisp holding balloons in my mouth! Shame I had to swallow them, but they did re-emerge at just the right time!


Edit: I gotta say, getting something out of your body only to put back into it is a rather unique experience!

If the heroin was in my house and easy to access, I had no power to say no. What's an addict to do?
My most ridiculous, though somewhat useful, method was to use a locking money box. I put my heroin in the box, with the key, then used my picks to lock it. THEN, I put the box in my locking toolbox in the bed of my truck and locked that with my picks. My reasoning was that if I were fucked up or drunk, it might be too difficult to pick both locks until I sobered up. It actually worked a few times, but I got too good at picking them (these are not difficult locks), so the only time it was a deterrence was late at night when I was too tired and lazy.

I also tried packing my gear up and mailing it to myself. This would have worked great had I not gotten too paranoid about the USPS sensing the heroin and confiscating it.

This woman is pretty spot on with a lot of things. I don't mean vague shit, either. Very very personal.. ""how the fuck would she know that"" shit. We have been seeing her together mainly because of my addiction. I hate to do this to her but my mom thinks I quit again. I just hate her thinking I'm using because she worries herself like crazy even more than she does when I'm clean. At this point it's a matter of not wanting to quit because I really cannot deal with the withdrawals. I have a chronic anxiety disorder as it is and when withdrawals kick in my anxiety is so bad that I want to kill myself to end the anxiety alone. I'm not joking when I say that it is so bad that its almost a painful gut wrenching feeling every five minutes. You can also forget about sleep, I can't sit still long enough as it is but that fucking anxiety.. it's unbearable. 

Well, apparently the lady we have been seeing told my mom I'm going to die soon. ""It's just a matter of weeks"" is what my mom just relayed to me. I really hope this lady is wrong. Or at least I have the ability to change it. I have way too much to live for. I'm not gonna let that woman be right. So it's over. I'm done. This woman has been spot on with almost everything else... so thats it. 

I NEED to find some way to dull withdrawals. At least to the point where the anxiety is tolerable. Please.. if anyone knows of some miracle combinations of natural remedies or anything tell me. Kratom is something I'm fully stocked on.. but the last time I went through withdrawals it didn't fucking help them hardly at all.. and I took A LOT.  (The last time was two weeks ago when I went through withdrawals and this was because my mom found out I was using again. I went to the fucking hospital with her hoping they would care enough to give me something to at least help me sleep and they didn't do shit. So I went back to the boy because I couldn't fucking take it anymore. And I've been using since while she thinks I quit. I know Im a horrible person.. don't have to remind me.) 

Is Xanax for sleep and anxiety and adderall for energy and working good combinations? Are they safe combinations? Would they actually make the withdrawals dull enough to function right? What about CBD oil? Does that stuff really work? Please help me out guys. This is really eating away at me. I can't leave this planet anytime soon.

(x-post from /r/OurOverUsedVeins),"For once, I'm legitimately freaking psyched! For the first time in my life, I have my very own place, living by myself. Not living with family, and no roommates. No one to judge me when I pull out my kit and draw up a shot (though, to be fair, my roommates at the place I'm leaving today are both junkies too and obviously didn't give a fuck); just me. I dropped the deposit off a few days ago, I got the keys yesterday, and I've been moving in today. It's only an efficiency (aka a studio apartment), and is only somewhere 400-500 sq feet. A small-ass shack, really, built against the side of a huge, late-1800s Victorian house, located in the downtown of one of our nation's 10 largest cities. However, it only costs me $645/month in a good college neighborhood near my work and just inside downtown, and water, sewage, gas, and electric utilities are all included in the rent. Plus, it's cute as hell (see the pic lol).

How can I afford this so easily now, when I was on the verge of being homeless only like four months ago? Perseverance: after losing-slash-leaving my good job moving furniture for personal reasons (they caught me huffing paint thinner, and shortly after caught me shooting a speedball in the bathroom. Yeah, I'm not smart), I worked a couple shitty fast food jobs with shit pay and shit hours just to manage to scrape by, while looking for something good, and *somehow* having just barely enough money to stay well enough to work. Even my ""supplemental income"", being a reliable middleman for upper-middle class white people in their 20s and 30s, took a hit when a certain subforum of a certain major news aggregate got banned. Nearly three weeks ago, my roommate got a job at a high-end ramen restaurant that his friends/acquaintances had JUST opened that week, and when I asked if they had any openings, they hired me right away! Now, thanks to working my ASS off right away and proving my worth to the owners, I'm working 50-60 hours a week (this last week I had 58.8 hours) for more money per hour than I made back at the furniture company, which means I'm making more than enough money to get everything in my life back on track, starting with my new apartment! 

Shit is, finally, looking up. Next step: secure a mode of transportation, and since I live so close to work, ***and*** I don't wanna deal with the hassle of getting a driver's license (if I even *can*, which is questionable), I just put a deposit down on [this bad boy right HURR!](http://i.imgur.com/aGbgLG7.jpg) Lol well, one just like it, except mine will be black and dark green. They make them custom, and they're currently working on mine. Badass little bikes are fully custom to how you want it, with both the bike itself and the engine being brand new and purchased *after* you tell them exactly what you want, are only $395 for all that. 

And for you who wanna say, yeah right, you'd spend the money on dope before you ever had four hundred bucks, normally you'd be right, but I finally have a job where I make enough to do both! 

Sorry for the rant, I'm just high as hell: figures my dope boy would just suddenly have some of the most fire #3 ever, right when I'm making decent money again. Which means I'm left going, ""Wait, shit, why is my wallet empty? I don't have enough for another g? Fuck.""",1502857367.0

Looking back I whored myself for pills. It wouldn't be the last time. The wife tells me to leave the military after my 4 years, so I do so unwillingly. I get a shit job working in a computer shop. I start taking more pills to deal with the life I hate. We divorce so I spend every night in a bar then start working in a bar. I got to where I was putting about 600 mg of oxy up my nose while selling them and screwing everything that walked my way. Then it got worse. 

I met a woman I thought was nice. I got prescribed 300 norco a month and would finish them in about a week. Then spend another 2k on anything I could get. I hated myself and my life so much I was trying to kill myself. I have overdosed numerous times but I loved obviously without going to the hospital. The second ex wife once called poison control and told them what I had taken and what to do. They said there's no reason I should be alive but to call 911. She didn't. Luckily I puked enough blood and laid in it that I survived. After being on subs the first time. I was with my family in a car. I was driving high as a fucking kite. There was a wreck right by us. The fire department arrives and dismiss the guy who wrecked into a tree. Saying he's just a junkie this isn't the first problem he has caused and let him lay bleeding. I envisioned that man as me. I'm a fucking junkie. Went to rehab did great. Realized the wife was evil. Got divorced rinse and repeat. Lots of drugs and booze and women. Hated myself. Sat staring at a gun for a good hour but couldn't do it because my kids would blame themselves. Started to get my shit together. 

Met a wonderful educated sexy woman. We are currently married. My honeymoon was partially ruined because I lost some of the subs meant for the trip. Now I am withdrawing for what I hope is the last time. It won't be though. It never is. I've had great jobs and shitty ones. I've been over the moon happy and did everything possible to die. 15 fucking years of being a god damn junkie. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks if you read it. I hate meetings. I'm feeling lost and no one really understands that I know. Thanks again",1502847715.0

Once i arrived he pulls out his bottle, and clearly they are no oxy i have ever seen.

I get home prep 3 of the 30s, push down and wait for the familiar feeling ive had with dilauidid. But what came next was unlike anything ive felt before.

The pins and needles were so painful it felt like glass was coming out of my skin, from my head to my toes, and my face got very very hot. My heart felt as if it was going to beat outta my chest. All the while thinking wtf did i just do.

Hope you are all well etc today my OPIfam!

There's a tldr at bottom btw but this took me a while to write with one eye shut and kinda nodding out lul

So today after scoring in the main part of the city, I was down a long one way alleyway with the homeless dude who helped me score. (I can usually score solo but didn't notice any regulars and wanted to get high quickly so offered the dude a bit out my bag for helping me out)
Anyways he had had his shot and left and i was just by myself now, albeit further down the lane as a guy from inside the door outside of which we were prepping our shots had explained how we were on CCTV and kindly asked us to move further down  the lane.
So I'm trying to finish of last bit of my shot, had slipped out vein when checking still registered lol when DUN DUN DUN disaster strikes in the form of a male and female police officer!

Think someone must have called them (there were some other junkies leaving lane as we entered lol) so the lady is the good cop and dude is the bad cop. She took my details and he 'searched' me. When they turned up and said something to make me aware of there presence I dropped my rig with maybe .3/.4 left in (mostly blood than dope in it now anyways aha) so they asked if I had anything on me and I said nope had just finished all I had. So guy frisks me a bit and doesn't find anything (now here's the JJ bit part 1) and obviously due to this fact he didnt find the maybe third of the bag that was left in my pocket ^_^

Now for the second JJ part? (Not sure if non dope finding/keeping things counts as JJ) So guy cop asks if one of the various uncapped rigs (this one not empty but nearly filled with blood however) was mine which I just dropped when they appeared. I explained how it wasn't mine and that it was actually blood not dope in it.
Anyways he must have decided he's going to charge/arrest me for something after finding nothing in his thankfully teribad frisk and declares whilst grabbing my wrist that this is endangering environment or w/e with used needles and I will be going straight to jail for 3 months because of it. Troughout this I'm a lil shook up but not that bad as;
 a) I'm feeling pretty high now
 b) I don't have any previous offences and a clean record so far (touch wood!!)
So they walk me out the lane and into the cop minivan parked up out front. He explains to his colleagues I will be getting a 3month prison sentence etc as I explain to the lady cop I've never had any trouble with cops and I don't have a record :)
So she must have confirmed this or smth now and gave the guy cop a nod or w/e as he says to me its my lucky day or w/e and the sentence is suspended (not happening this time). I declare it's a wake up call as I get out the minivan, roll a smoke and head off to double check I did have the rest of the dope and go (this time to a toilet) for a shot with last of that bag of dope lol

Tldr; Got a dig from cops, they didnt find the dope i had on me and I also got let off with slap on wrist rather than 3 month prison sentence ^_^

Now its time to have another shot of dope and watch this movie (out of furnace!) Might switch to family guy or smth though if Im not feeling this lol

Peace, love and happy nods Opifam!

Who else here is a fan of speedballs? They have really grown on me recently! I used to be a big fan of snorting coke, but wasn't too fond of smoking crack because of the ultra short duration, but I've found in a syringe with heroin it is improved enormously. I love the contrast - I.V. heroin is like submerging yourself in a gentle, warm stream, whereas I.V. coke is like going over Niagra Falls in a bucket - you just gotta hold on tight and enjoy the ride! Personally, I like to put more coke in, with just a little heroin to soften the edges and avoid the harsh crash that comes with I.V. coke alone - I find too much heroin can overpower the coke and, of course, using too much heroin in speedballs is what gives them their lethal reputation. It's a beautiful combination though, and I have noticed I actually fiend a lot less for a speedball than I would if I was just smoking crack, but I'm also slightly more cautious IVing as it occasionally has felt like too much which has been a little frightening. 

Who else likes speedballs? How do you do yours? Also - I'm relatively new to speedballs, though I've been a heroin addict for four years. I'm a little concerned that I've ruined heroin for myself now - am I always going to fiend for their to be cocaine in the syringe whenever I shoot up now? What are your experiences with that?

No ill effects when I came out the other side which always brings me great joy. 

&nbsp;

Now my running partner, took my money and handled the process of getting the subs delivered. Well, he spent it by accident but then he got lucky and was able to trade stix for subs. I'd like to think we're square, that I don't owe him anything and that nothing would be asked of me. At least nothing heavily inconvenient. It's one thing to take a bike ride on my day off, I can combine my leisure cardio with a trip to the ATM with my friend's card so that he can call his dboy. On such a day I wouldn't ask for anything nor would I want to take any dope on a day that I already dosed my sub.

&nbsp;

Today is not a day off, I like to spend the time before work eating, reading, writing (including but not limited to posting here) and drinking coffee. If this was last week, I would likely jump to do my friend a favor... go to the ATM for him so he could order dope and he would give me a bag or two. I have no such motive today.

&nbsp;

I shall respond shortly but I've waited thus far. I figure that I can pretend to have just woken up and indicate that I don't have enough time to play errand boy. Of course he may be able to bribe me in a way that does not involve dope. There is one way, akin to offering to buy me a soda.

&nbsp;

For next week, I'm giving serious consideration to fighting my craving for dope and spending my money on useful things. Grooming, shoes, maybe some clothes. I used to spend a lot of my money on pot. Then as I got into the game, I reduced my pot spending and diverted it towards dope. Now is a good a time as any to pull back spending on dope. Despite my reduced pot smoking, I've found it to be invaluable medicinally. Without subs it's a godsend. With subs, it still doesn't hurt to smoke an L before bed. 

&nbsp;

**Then there's last week. The dope was good.** My friend fell asleep and became unresponsive. For twenty minutes he was unresponsive to the point that I had to rub his upper lip, slap his skin in different places, and play the drums on his forearm to keep him breathing. It seemed that he wouldn't take his next breath without my intervention. Sat there for ninety more minutes talking about random topics. Just spewing out knowledge and talking about the things that I talk about to myself. Space, and time. Anything just to make noise. 


He vomited hours later. Luckily he was still planted in his chair upright so he didn't choke on any of it which is very lucky. I've been given permission to splash him with cold water in the future because that is a helluva lot easier than cleaning up vomit and death. 

&nbsp;


It's just obvious from what I see here and what I've experienced that opioid tolerance goes up, and up. The withdrawals bite worse with higher doses. I've lost muscle mass over the past year, as opposed to maintaining it and adding to it. My sex appeal is still somewhat there but it's becoming ever transient. The appeal of sex is somewhat transient but I hope that kicking dope would make that normal again. If not, I got a supplement for that. 

&nbsp;

I just need to stack my chips and get myself out there. This dope game is incompatible with that. Shorter term goals already mentioned, put money towards necessities. I'm not sure how my friend will react when I choose not to jump on an order with him next week. If there is no bulk discount, there shouldn't be any disappointment. Not sure what to expect. Will he support my decision or oppose it? Perhaps he'll verbally support it but attempt to subvert it through action? Maybe I'm being paranoid. We'll see. I'll tell him I'm taking a break. It's probably more truthful at this stage but I know it wouldn't be a bad thing if it lasted forever.

&nbsp;

P.S.- I really hate being dopesick and am really glad that I'm not on this day. I can't fully imagine what others go through but the experience of being an addict has taught me not to judge others as harshly as I once did.",1502826432.0

So the other day, my buddy and I (with 2 grand on my lap in the middle of the hood doing our regular 30min-2 hour wait) strike up a debate on why these motherfuckers have no idea how to do anything in a timely manner. Like your ONE JOB is to just show up on time. It's literally the only thing you have to do. 

My buddy thinks it's because the dboy wants to make sure that he is never the one waiting. He wants to meet quick and be out quick. So he's carefully and precise about how he meets people.  

I think these guys are just too fucking unitelligent to figure out how time works. Their brain functions at too low of a level. So in a way it's not really their fault. They're just too dumb.

What do you guys think?",1502825036.0

He didn't get stopped so I guess he's good? After about a minute or 2 he calls me and tells me to meet him at a different spot. My hearts still racing because of what just happened, so I meet up with him again and all is well. When I get in his car I ask him what the fuck was that? Lmao he's like ""man that shit happens about once a week it ain't nothing if you ever get stopped like that just take off and you'll be good.""

i have these because 3 months ago i had mono, and ibuprofen wasn't cutting it for pain so i was prescribed hydro's. i only took one every six hours, and it manifested in some hyperness and itchy nose. Didn't finish the whole prescription and just hung onto the extra in case i needed a stronger pain med for another reason.

i was recently prescribed a twice daily antibiotic to treat another medical condition, and i forgot to take one last night so i was gonna pop two this morning to get on track.

well.

the bottles look the same, and so do the pills... and ridiculously idiotic me didn't read the bottle label because i'd forgotten i even had the hydro's out in the first place. so i popped two hydro's instead-- and the max i'd ever had before was one. so this is new. lol


i called into work and let them know that i needed to come in a couple hours late, which they didn't question. so now i ask you:

is there anything i should look out for/be cautious of, or should i just ride out the mild high and enjoy it while i can? (in case it matters for how it affects me, i'm 130lb 5'7 and 20 years old.)

i am now taking 1/64th of an 8mg tablet, my final dose

But i want to tell you all something: the funny thing is, that i actually felt it. you read that correctly. i felt 1/64th of a 8mg tablet.

im not sure exactly the doseage i took but it was probably approximately 0.01 or 0.02 mg? not much at all. like a few grains of sea salt worth lol


suboxone is my DOC if i was to ever go back to opiates .



this stuff is recreational as fuck when you know how to use it.
by knowing how to use it i mean the absorbtion of the pill under the tongue for as long a possible. and i think thats the reason i get such great results at such low doseages and my tolerance has not gone up in 10 years

i have been on suboxone for 10 years straight with no missed doseages or fuckups. 


this is a potent drug at the end of the day and should be treated with respect. 


that being said i also think it should be more available to people who want to quit because once you realllllly understand it and how it works, and you , yourself want to be healthy, than it really does start working. and sometimes it works better than you expect. so in essence i was keeping clean with suboxone but getting all of the great effects that i need from the medication while keeping all possible side effects at a minimum by taking a low a dose as possible while keeping it under the tongue for as long as possible.


even low doses when kept under the tongue for longer periods of time i have found to sometimes even work better


The dryer your mouth is the longer it will sit their and therefore more will be absorbed never spit it out or drink while taking it .



i use the amneals because they are the most akin thing to the original stopsign suboxone. they might even be better because they're harder pressed. 


anyways, heres to not relapsing within my first couple of months. i wanna make it to atleast 3 months lol. but i know im one of those people that kinda need opiates because a lot of newer medications, are either too harmful or simply do not work well with my body. i do not like having my brain fogged.

 even suboxone originally did not , because i was overprescribed, 32mg for a 100mg oxy habit



anyways im blabbering, im not really in widthdrawal, but i am glad i have tapered. i think the benzos are working. 


anyways, i will always love opiates, weed, benzos (not quitting benzos and weed yet lol) but now i have a lot more respect for the chemicals themselves and my own body, and i don't want to be that guy who  needs 5000mg of fent to feel relief when hes 40 because he has 98340923 gigawatts of bupe in his system. 


i just hope by then the war on drugs has ended because people will get their shit either way,and if they don't get their shit, some people resort to extreme measures to make themselves feel good.

If this is for real, my mind will be blown, cause I had the biggest crush on her when we worked together but she had a boyfriend at the time. This time... I have a real chance.

¬†

They won‚Äôt understand you. They won‚Äôt.I know this, because I used to be on their side, stuck in a dead end office, working a shitty job, making decent pay. My family and friends were convinced I‚Äôd lost my mind when I gleefully leaped into the unknown abyss of cooking. I suppose they thought it was a phase I‚Äôd soon grow out of. Could this be you? Maybe finishing high school and are contemplating a life in the kitchen, or are already in culinary school. Maybe its not you, but rather someone close to you. Whatever the circumstances, if you‚Äôve gotten this far, I implore you to keep reading.

¬†

Chefs are a rare, often misunderstood breed and if you‚Äôre amongst thenaysayers, I don‚Äôt blame you, I really don‚Äôt, however if the smallest piece of you is debating a life in the kitchen, or have already taken that plungefinding yourself needing reassurance, you might find that here. There‚Äôs also ample evidence to scare you away, there is plenty of that here. It just depends on the way your mind works.

¬†

Most will never know what it‚Äôs like to make a living as a professional cook or chef, and that makes me smile. It‚Äôs something of which I am arrogantly proud. No, not because I think we‚Äôre better than anyone, but because of the fact that to be a really good cook or chef it takes tremendous physical, mental and emotional fortitude. Most people don‚Äôt have, nor appreciate the gifts we‚Äôve been given, and this often includes our front of the house counterparts.

¬†

Seven days a week, we show up willing to get our asses kicked. We sign up for this in exchange for an opportunity to express ourselves through food. There‚Äôs no such thing as weekends or holidays. We might get a random Tuesday off, and if we‚Äôve put in the proper dues and happen to be in cahoots with the chef, we just might have the good fortune of being exonerated from working thedreaded Sunday Morning brunch shift. No one wants to work Sunday morning. We work longer days than just about anyone. Days start early and end late, typically when the rest of the western world is changing into their PJs, brushing their teeth and hopping into bed. The length, isn‚Äôt the hard part though, its the depth. Fifteen hours on your feet is grueling enough to scare away some fence-straddlers, but on top of that, consider the kitchen atmosphere where everything is either excruciatinglyhot or sharp as hell. Cooks scurryaround cussing, the printer spewing out tickets as fast as it can, and for hours every inch of one‚Äôs body is physically tested. Emotions are tested, and sometimes you will fail that test. You‚Äôll break into frustration mid-shift, relying on a teammate to help pull you through. Your mental strength will be tested‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämisreading tickets, overcooking steaks, undercooking pasta, or completely blanking the fuck out on any number of things, once again having to rely on a teammate to pull you through.You‚Äôll do the same for him‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit‚Äôs how we survive. Close call finger-nicks and tears shed while chopping onions don‚Äôt phase us, not even secondarily. Screaming hot 50 pound pots of salted water simmer away, not boiling fast enough most of the time. When the potatoes or pasta are ready to come out, chances are a dry towel is nowhere to be found, and lacking time to search, we somehow make do, most likely further searing the callouses up and down our already damaged hands. Pain is an after thought, it doesn‚Äôt phase us. It can‚Äôt, or the whole ship sinks. We owe it to the warriors next to us to keep going. There will also be a point mid-shift, when you‚Äôll have to make a dash to the dry storage pantry, or the walk-in cooler. Darting across the obstacle course of the kitchen typically includes maintaining one‚Äôs sense of balance while leaping across oil-slicked tile, dodging pans flying in the vicinity of the dish pit, and having to weave in and out of fellow line cooks, then back into our place on the line. This is all to be done without dropping your supplies, or worse, disrupting the rhythm of the team. Disrupt the rhythm, and we all go down with you. This takes serious skills. To create the rhythm necessary for success on the kitchen line takes hours and sometimes years working together as a unit, in the trenches,slugging it out, together. Next to the military in full fledged combat, a group of guys and gals in the kitchen know teamwork better than anyone.

¬†

Let‚Äôs say you made it to the end of the service. By now several hours have elapsed since the first tickets camechirping through the printer, and the apron draped around your neck now resembles something your dog might have chewed to hell after having splashed through the mud. You arefilthy, but pots are done flying across the kitchen, flames from the burners are dulled to mere pilot lights and for the first time all night, you have a minute to breathe. A Red Bull sounds pretty good right about now, or traditionally, a cigarette in the cool fresh air outside of the kitchen hits the spot for most chefs. The burns on your hand have probablyblistered already, and now that you actually have a minute, the pain hits you. The slightest of breaks and its back to business identifying prep needs for the following day. It‚Äôs the easy part of the night, coasting home, after a dozen hours afoot. Now, the challenge is powering through when your mind is occupied with fantasies of beers, shots, the dive bar across the street and the pretty new waitress whose name you‚Äôve already forgotten.

¬†

If there is one thing I‚Äôve learned as a chef, it is that we are always learning to adapt ‚Äîrolling with the punches. We put ourselves out there as artists and creators. Its a beautiful thing to have the opportunity to express ourselves through the creation of food, and the food we craft should be an expression of who we are. What we create is just as much of how the world has shaped us, as it is us shaping the way we see the world through our food. Unfortunately, most diners don‚Äôt connect with our perspective. They want their food, their way, and it pisses us the hell off. Chances are, if you aren‚Äôt a chef, this has been you, and we have undoubtedly bitched about you to our fellow cooks. If you‚Äôve ever put your work out into the world, you know how much it stings to have your work not appreciated as you intended. This is what keeps us up at night asking ourselves how could I do it better, and what should I have done differently? It eats at us if we let it.

¬†

DON'T LET IT.

¬†

Chances are your family, friends and virtually anyone close to you will be unsuccessful in understanding the life you have chosen for yourself, but maybe this letter helps, just a bit. If so, they might understand why your mind is racing at 2AM after a 400 cover Friday night, and why you can‚Äôt celebrate Mother‚Äôs Day brunch with the fam. Perhaps now they might understand why every square inch of your body hurts most of the time, and how there really are no sick days in restaurants. They might understand why we settle for grossly underpaid wages, and hopefully they can read between the lines, and figure out why we bitch about customers upon getting off of work. They might understand how the stress from our jobs might lead us to have a few cocktails, which might be followed with a few bad decisions. Above all, if nothing else, maybe they will see that we can‚Äôt imagine our lives any other way.

¬†

I‚Äôll take a hand full of burn blisters, some achy knees and the hankering for a cocktail at the end of the night, over ever having to sit at another desk miserably debating whether or not to shove needles through my eye balls. Living this life means we get to be creative. It means we get to showcase our skills in the heat of battle, feeling the adrenaline rush of sloshing through the trenches with guys to our left and right. These are guys we‚Äôre lucky to call teammates. It means we get to be creative and stand proud for something we believe in. We get to sleep with a certain piece of mind and awaken the following morning hungry for more. Even if it means suiting up for brunch every now again, we get to make a difference in the lives of people around us, in the best way we know how. We get to make them happy, and we get to through food.

¬†

Promise me this:

¬†

Show up every day looking to make the most of it. Learn from the best, seek to be the best, and once you are on your way, teach others to be the best. This life won‚Äôt be easy. It will be damn hard, but it will be worth it, and in the end you will have lived a life of which you are proud, one that‚Äôs yours, and in doing so, you get to make the world taste a bit better in the process.

I used to live in a city in the northeast that was pretty liberal and smack was everywhere. I used craigslist a few times to find H (one turned into a pretty relyable plug) and it was everywhere. Here's the problem, tho.

Im a tall skinny white gay dude, and while im not like a flaming one (like the way I walk and dress), its obvious that im kinda different. While I don't have stereotypical gay voice either it's kind of hard to hide the little differences. Being skinny helps because I look like a typical junkie even when Im not using but I also look like I could get snapped in half real easy. The area im in is pretty conservative too, so im worried that people will not wanna hook me up. There also arent a ton of white junkies here, most of the places i go are majority hispanic/black and so i stick out like a sore thumb.

Copping where Im at now is just a lot different. H isn't as available, its mostly crystal or coke which I dont really fuck with so i have to go a lot deeper into sketchy places to find it. I just dont wanna get pegged as someone thats weak or easy to take advantege of, because I dont want to get ripped off, jacked or robbed or worse.

Is it just the way I hold myself? Like, if I think i belong out in the areas id go to cop, Ill belong in the areas Id go to cop? Or are there specific tips and things i can do to make myself look less like a target. What kind of attitude could i take?

Maybe Im just overthinking this but i havent had a lot of success here and havent been taking as many chances when copping here. Ive been able to get pills from a friend in the meantime but i really want some of that sweet, sweet h that I had back north.

I know im basically admitting im kind of a bitch but i didnt grow up in an area that toughened me up at all and i dont have any friends that use so im kind of on my own. I need all the help I can get.

I don't know if it's day two for Tom but it's day two for Cliff and I with regard to begging from Tom. I told him that I'd try to get him a couple of subs by mid day. Then he's upset that I ""promised"" and it's beyond mid day. I can't control when the the middle gets the subs delivered to him by whoever has them. He keeps whining that he has work, doesn't want to be sick at work and that he hasn't eaten in two days. I can't tell if he's sick or not but Tom is certainly not an IV user. He isn't vomiting nor is he pale on this panicked evening. 

&nbsp;

Last night he said some borderline mean things, questioned my honesty and talked shit about my friend/middle. I didn't take it too personally because I know he ain't feeling all that great. At some point I told him outright that he was being ""a fucking animal and a crybaby."" To which he responded, ""That's really fucked up its all good bro I got you"", ""A animal cry baby seriously you little fuck I gave you credit for 2 weeks without bothering you for pay"", ""and I'm the fucking animal"", ""There was not one time I said no and if there was I didn't have anything to give"", ""You know what it's like going to work sick and your going to call me a animal crybaby really ?""
, ""I got you [name] no worries"", ""Maybe if your family knew you had a little problem your self they call you a cry baby animal ??""

The aforementioned quotes represent individual text mesages all received back to back. The last one was virtually a threat. At that point I responded, ""I can't believe you're insulting me like this and I'm still willing to help you with the subs. I must be the stupidest fucking ass to be willing to make sure you get subs tomorrow."" Then, ""It would be in your best interest to apologize before tomorrow afternoon if you want any kind of relief.""

&nbsp;

Anyway, the aforementioned exchange is the tip of the iceberg. Despite some of the essay length text messages he sent me, he grasped at many straws. Among which included digging for guilt, reminding me of past favors and explaining that he's offering my friend an irresistable trade and that it made no sense that he'd decline to help in lieu of such disproportionate retribution.


When Tom is desperate he offers ridiculously disproportionate options. It's not unlike him saying ""give me 5 blues today and I'll give you 15 blues next week.""

In this case, it got to a point where he offered Cliff to pay him back for 10 greens in 9 days + give him 45 free blues. Cliff isn't biting. Last time he agreed to such a deal he didn't get most of the bonus amount because Tom's doc got arrested. Tom didn't feel responsible since the situation was caused by an external factor. Now that he's desperate, he is willing to give a bonus as well as pay back for the unpaid bonus from last time.

&nbsp;


As time went on during day two, a little before midnight Tom offered Cliff 40 blues for 10 greens.

After hours upon hours and nearly a thousand text messages, some starting with a brief salutation just to get a response, and others with a grandiose offering cliff isn't biting.

No bueno.

6u5ay9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6u5ay9/my_ride_on_the_opiate_wagon/,9,https://redd.it/6u5ay9,Shreddedraver66,My ride on the opiate wagon.,"Hello Reddit, all my life I have been enthralled by drugs. May they be illicit, or completley legal their various interactions within the human body has always intrigued me. I can vividly remember my first experience with opiates. Thirteen years of age, two full bottles of tussionex. Heaven.

Fast forward 8 years, I have tried every drug you can possibly think of. Was able to avoid any physical addictions or health complications. Until I landed my first ""big boy job"" This was a job that paid very well but was extremely physically laborious. So I reached out to my old friend Mr opiate.

Oxycodone was his name, at first a welcome friend to my days of hardship. He made me warm and fuzzy, energetic, hopeful. And for a while it seemed like I had the world by the balls. Until one day slowly without realizing it, the tables had turned. My doses slowly escalated as did my need for oxycontin to be entertwined not only with my work but daily activities outside of work.

Two years went by and I was making close to 1500$ a week living at home with my parents, paying close to no bills.....with a bank account running on E. Oxycontin was no longer my friend, but my lifeblood. I needed it more than food in the morning. I can remember countless days choosing to obstain from eating in order to get another pill. If I did not dose every 5-6 hours the chills would set in, and I knew just how screwed I truley was.  This behavior went on for a while until I reached out and went to a Suboxone doctor.

 I knew this was simply trading one addiction for another, and I'm not one to advocate using narcotics with potentially even worse withdrawal and addiction rate than the very pills I was so desperate to escape from. But, suboxone gave me my life back just almost to the point were I wanted it.

My bank account skyrocketed, I was much more level headed, I was able to maintain and grow a beautiful relationship with my partner. But in the back of my head I knew that eventually there would come a time I needed to get off the Suboxone as well.

Over a period of six months I went from 14mg-2mg. Until without my doctor's supervision or knowledge decided I had enough of the shackled and jumped off the subs at 2mg. First week was absolutely horrid, my bed and no sence of hope. Second week more of the same. But from day 14-now day 36 it has been a steady improvement.

I genuinely feel like I'm almost back to who I was before the opiates took over my life. And this goes out to anyone out there who knows they need to bite the bullet. I PROMISE you, that not being chained to a pill or strip or powder is the way to go.

I stumbled across this place a couple of weeks ago, and it seems like this is the perfect place for me. I am a 33 year old woman, IV user of heroin. I have been using every day for the past 6 years. Prior to my IV use, I was a pill popper for 5 years. I am on the verge of quitting though. I'm not sure being active here will help or hurt while I'm trying to go clean, but it seems like everyone here are not judgemental for the most part. 

I truly don't have anyone in my life that I can talk to about this part of my life. And to be honest, this part of my life is my ENTIRE life and has been for years. I have a boyfriend who is also a user, but I can't talk to him about anything that doesn't concern him and only him. But my relationship with him is a WHOLE other story.

Also, I remember doing shots and the cotton stuck to the spoon and left fibers behind, because my dumbass would leave the cotton there until I did another shot. 

Now, I know cotton fever isn't necessarily from cotton fibers getting into your rig-- it's from bacteria from the cotton, correct? But I think it could be a bit of both.

So this last 60days or so has been crazy for me. It started out with getting injured pretty bad at my last job. Broke a couple bones in my arm and at least 4 in my face. Once I finally healed up enough to get a return to work slip and no more l&i checks I quit that job because it was terrible and much to dangerous. Now at this time of relapsed a month or two prior but was still holding it all together for the most part until my family found a used rig. I had been staying with them since I got out of inpatient and things were going alright till around then. Here I was again tho sick and without income and what did I do? Steal from my family again.... it wasn't much just $20 here and pawned and old tablet there but it was enough to raise questions after finding the rig. So after my terrible decisions and yet another awful fight that night with my parents I said fuck it borrow their vehicle and went to smoke some weed with friends to get away. I thought everything was cool when I got home. I came in microwaved some food and changed my clothes when my mom comes down and asks me what I was out doing. I replied with just smoking some bud with friends and she disappears off to the other room and I think nothing of it. 5minutes later I go to take out the trash and hear a Big Bang on the door at 5am. Thinking nothing of it I head out back to the garbage cans while saying I'm not here to my mom in the other room thinking nothing of it. As I come back in the house I'm greeted my 2 large officers who clearly have a bone to pick with me. Apparently my parents reported the car stolen, seeing how I returned the car with a full tank and in perfect condition they arrested me with a class c felony 'taking possession of a vehicle without owners permission' and I spent the night in county. In the morning I went to court and was released with a no contact order leaving me homeless. I ended up walking and bussing 22mi to my sisters place where they left 2 garbage bags of my stuff at and that was that. Luckily once I charged my phone I found a voicemail back from one of my dream jobs saying they loved me in my interview and would like me to come in and finalize the job offer and start immediately. At this point I thought fuck the world is trying hard to give me a new beginning and I went for it hard. I ended up finding an abandoned house to stay in only a couple miles from my new job and set up shop walking to work everyday and making it work. Those first couple weeks were rough barely middlemanning enough to stay well and pretty much starving until I got my first paycheck. This is where I took a great thing and fucked it up. Instead of just sticking to the original plan of moving up and finding a place to live in my junkie brain took over and decided it was time to get back on with how many people were using me to middle man. It didn't take more than a week of me being on to end up pulling an all nighter and coming into work looking pretty fucking out of it. Boy did they notice quick too. I gave them some random excuse and they half bought it and told me not to let it happen again. Then the next day happens and I hadn't even done a shot since 2am the night before but one of the big bosses sees me looking tired after lunch from plain lack of sleep and having to walk everywhere on account of being basically homeless. With the history from the day before tho this boss wasn't having any of it and fired me on the spot. This job was literally like a once in a life time chance....I mean how often do you get hired to grow and package weed at a super cool and chill company...Now that's gone..In my depression from that day I've fucked off selling and am down to less than a ball with little cash to show for it and still pretty much homeless, abandoned by my family and real friends and only have fellow junkies who steal all my stuff to be around....If you made it this far in my ramblings I guess thank you for listening...I don't really expect any replies to this but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

I couldn't care for my son as an addict so I sent him to live with his mother, he's one. So I lost my kid, and my addiction has gotten so bad that it started to affect my work so I just quit because I'm gonna get fired anyway at this rate my addiction is out of control. Plus my best friend's father had a very close friend in this company, and people went out of their way for me here. So I'm not trying to embarrass anyone. But my addiction is so bad that rehab is the only way out.

My dealer left for CA for a few months, so I wanted to stock up. After debating with myself to either get more dope or get oxy, I decided to go with oxy and called my dealer. Dealer said I was too late and he sold out his oxy supply. Fuck. But.... he had dillys. So I grabbed like 15 dilly 8s. 

I decided fuck it I'm going to rehab in a few weeks anyway, and I put myself in so much danger all the time drinking pints of whiskey and snorting heroin, that safely IVing dilaudid is not going to substantially increase my risk of dying at this point, at least if I avoid the booze combination.

My tolerance is around 5-6 blues taken orally, what do you guys think would be a good starting dose for dilaudid? Im thinking around 4 of these would be good for a good first shot. What do you all think? I could probably handle more than 4 and I don't want to waste them on a subpar high, but I don't wanna overwhelm myself. 

Edit: Well apparently I was being stupid thanks for that guys. I went with significantly less and prepped two pills for separate injections. I did a full 8mg, then waited like 30ish minutes and did another. Now I'm chillen and fading into the land of the nod. Good night all.",1503030552.0

First time. Worried about what the outcome could be. Please help.,"So yeah. This was about two weeks ago. I have a hearing in mid-September. I was pulled over for apparently failing to use my turn signal when switching lanes (I didn't switch, I actually just casually drifted a little to the left for a second because someone was flying down the off-ramp). Anyway, I'm immediately pulled over by three police vehicles. As I hand my drivers' license over, the officer asks to see my wallet, so I hand it to him. I have completely forgotten that I have a percocet or some such in one of the clear pockets. He asks what it is and why I have it. Truthfully, I was rock climbing in a different state all weekend, and I brought it in case I sustained a minor injury and needed to get through the day. I didn't even think about getting high or the legal consequences before shoving it in my wallet.

My charge is a 3rd degree indictable offence, which is the equivalent of a felony in another state. The officer who processed me said that since it was a first time offence it would be reduced to something else. What could it be reduced to? Is there any real possibility I will be put on probation or in jail? I have an office job and don't own a car (Was driving a friend's car. Amazingly they found weed on her and didn't do a single thing about it) and I don't even live in the state where the offense took place, so this is all hugely inconvenient for me. Not to mention any fines this might incur. 

I received three letters from attorneys tonight saying they could represent me and possibly have the charge dismissed. The letters also stressed the possible consequences of this charge, including jail time. While I'm inclined to think these are just research savvy lawyers looking for a client, I'm also on edge now and wondering if maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to hire an attorney. 

Mostly I'm wondering, what is the likelihood the charge is reduced, and what would it be reduced to?

Recovery will always be something that will have to be kept in the forefront of our minds but remaining sober is definitely possible. A little bit about me. I'm a Gulf War Marine Corp veteran that sustained a broken femur as well as several lumbar vertebrae. Because of my accident, this was my introduction to opiates. I've been on opiates for roughly 5 years with a very irresponsible doctor in the  VA system. My doctor literally gave me WHATEVER I told him to give me. Every 28 days, I was overnighted my dope. Immediate release and Extended release opiates. I was an all out junkie. I didn't even hurt anymore. The ability to not have to worry about where my drugs would come from made for a very happy junkie. I told my doctor I couldn't sleep at night and I needed something for sleep so here came the benzos. I was existing for the sole purpose of getting high. Vodka, benzos, opana and oxycodone IR was my daily ritual. Basically all day long. Wasn't ever sober and that was fine with me. I thought I had the world by the ass on a downhill pull. Because they were prescription drugs, I didn't see myself for what I was........an addict. For shits and giggles, i tested myself to see if I had a problem and I tried to go 1 full day sober. All hell broke loose. That was the first time I ever felt withdrawal. Needless to say I didnt make the day clean. So it became real then...I had a problem. My macho Marine ego wouldn't allow me to reach out for professional help. Plus I felt ashamed and embarrassed. These forums were a God-send. Vitamins, lopes, melatonin, gym sessions and PRAYERS brought me to 54 days clean. I'm training 5 days a week and I'm feeling amazing. The urge is still there but I'm not willing to trade this new feeling for a ride that will end in guilt. For those that may be at day 1 or day 15, keep at it. The days get shorter and it gets easier. Day after day, they start to add up. Do not quit. There is life after dope. I'm a believer in God. I know for a fact all of my praying and continual prayers keep me. Addiction is something not everyone understands. I totally get it. If I can help with advice, words of encouragement or even praying on the phone with you, reach out to me and I promise I'll stop what I'm doing and make myself available.

Shortly before I got clean from IV use, two 'friends' and fellow users got caught up bad in the scene. I had visited one of them just a week or two prior to their arrest in order to cop a few bags. The two of them (a couple,) ended up killing a guy they were staying with, took his money, then cut the body up and dumped him in a suitcase by the local airport. They've been in jail for over 3 years now and I've yet to find any news reports as to whether or not they've actually been sentenced.

Things are going pretty well. I still use every once in a while, but for the most part I keep my veins clean :P. I have a fulltime job now, as well as another parttime side gig that pays fairly well. 

I'm a musician, and recently had some originals of mine produced. It's been a long-time dream of mine, and I definitely would never have been able to do it if I was still using. (I went ahead and posted a YouTube link down in the comments, if any of you are interested in hearing me...)

Before turning myself in though I want to go thru the withdrawal. Now I've been playing this game for a long, long time. But the recent introduction of Suboxone is a game changer (I know it's not super recent but I'm not very familiar with it save for a couple of times I tried it). So rather than prolong the inevitable, and before I can change my mind about going cold turkey, I was thinking of taking some sub to jump start the withdrawal process. The last time I took Suboxone I waited the twenty four hours and then took way too much and who would have guessed it, I had the worst PW's ever! I was sweating so much it looked like it was raining on me, I was shitting uncontrollably, and vomiting like some sort of fountain square statue. 
 Now normally my withdrawals last about a week (the really bad vomiting, nausea and shitting), followed by another three weeks of restless legs and no sleeping or eating. 
 My question is if I jump started the wd process how long could I expect it to last? Would it be over quicker if I started with a little sub and just kept taking little pieces every 24 hours, or should my dumbass just let nature take its course and then start with little pieces of sub? I really just want to get this over with but the thing is I don't have much time before I have to turn myself in. So I come to you for advice. I may get down voted to Oblivion and called all kinds of names but if I get just a little good advice it'll be worth it. If anyone else has attempted this, what happened? How did you feel? Because in my experience the precipitated withdrawal was almost more gentle than my regular withdrawal. After vomiting and shitting I felt like nothing was wing until the next round. It was so strange. So I'll stop rambling now and let the hate pour in I suppose. Thanks again everyone.",1503008212.0

She was then switched to opana for ER pills, but even then she only got Roxi 10s for breakthrough pain.  I've never known anyone to get anything stronger in my state, or at least this part of it.

I guess it would violate the sourcing rule to discuss what states, or regions, were more likely to have doctors prescribing stronger opiates, but if not I'd love to find out where such doctors were located.

Please take time to read my story. 

Been dating this woman for 3 1/2 yrs now and the past 2yrs have been heartbreaking. 
We started off absolutely great and fell in love early.  She is an amazing woman and we love each other deeply. 

I knew she had a past of partying and doing some hard shit. We both do, but on different spectrums. I'd go to concerts and dabble in some LSD or Molly.  She used to hang around a rough crowd and do some ice or H. 
The first yr We were together i knew she was clean.  Maybe do a hydro now and then. But not banging shit.  I guess for what I knew at the time she wasn't. 

So about a yr after we met I bought a house and the first thing i did was give her a key and said ""move in whenever u want baby, I consider this ours"". She moved right in, and I was so happy! 

A couple mos later she started hanging around a different crowd and noticed a lil difference in her. I worked 2nd and one night I came home and she was passed out.  Barely could wake her.  We had planned on cooking dinner together when I got off work so I was worried.  I didn't have a lighter to light a smoke and I opened her purse.  I found a bag full of clean needles! I was in shock! Furious at the time! She had made a promise to me about doing hard shit and would tell me and talk to me about it.  And I told her if you did ""Never Bring it in our house!"" I have kids and don't wanna expose them to that.  We talked and worked it out.  I love this woman! I want to help her any way I can.  She said it had been going on for about a mo and said she was done.

 Still a little raw from this and now having some trust issues I keep a closer eye and a ear to the ground.  A few mos go by and while she's in the shower I grab her phone and peek.  She had txt this good friend of hers that I had never suspected doing any of that. it said something along the lines of ""can I get a bag today? "" she responded ""give me a ride to re-up and I got u"". I'm not dumb,  been around all kinds of drug scenes, and have partied with the best n worst of them.  I confront her and she said she was only doing just enough so she and her friend wouldn't get sick. 

Now, extremely sad, depressed, and pissed all at the same time. But we talk it out, she promised me that she would go to NA meetings.  Her and her friend did for a few months. Then shit started getting weird again.  Would go and give random friends rides n shit.  So I knew and tried to confront her.  She would tell me nothing's going on.  I knew better. 

 I have always told her to let me be her rock.  Lean on me, be honest and we'll get thru anything. If you use or get the craving of using just talk to me and I'll help as much as I can,  just PLEASE BE HONEST.

So in the past 2yrs I've found her rig or shit like that bout 4 times.  Whether it's a syringe in a can or a water bottle cap with a filter stuck in it.  She has disappeared for a whole weekend twice. And when she does disappear she ignores my calls n txt.  Then bout 3 to 5 days later ill get a txt from her.  I've confronted her when i know she's totally zonked. I'm not dumb,  her eyes get all wonky and they're pinned the fuck out. She always denies and says she's not. WHY WON'T SHE BE HONEST!?

So this last time I found some shit, just a couple wks ago,  she said she had been doing it for 2mos. I knew something was up because She had been hiding her arm from me. She was sorry and said it was a mistake. Said she had been trying to ween off but was afraid of getting sick.  But said she was really happy I found her shit and was ready for the sickness and WDs. She went thru it and i was proud of her.

I love this woman! She is so amazing besides this struggle. She treats me like a king and will do anything for me.  And I'll do anything for her! But my trust is completely gone and it makes me really sad inside.

 I don't understand why she won't let me be her rock?  Why she won't talk to me before she has these cravings? I feel like she really isn't stopping at all, just getting better and better at hiding it from me.  I just wanna trust again! I hate being the bf who goes thru her shit.  I'm a very passive, laid back guy who has never been controlling. And now I feel like I am and I hate that.  I don't know what to do. How to confront her properly without it escalating into something bad.

so when he was filling a script for patches he would carefully use an exacto knife and open the foil package and would either steal the whole thing or a half of it.  to close the foil packet back up he would use superglue and he was quick as fuck, he showed me at home one day.

unfortunately someone either ended up complaining or another tech saw him (which was obviously bound to happen but you know how addicts go).  the pharmacist said he had him on camera doing it and would be charged with felonies unless he signed a paper admitting his guilt.  he stupidly signed the papers and the pharmacist straight up told him ""sorry but i was lying to you about that and now that you have actually signed an admission of guilt i will be calling the police and you will be charged"".  that was a super dirty move although i understand what pharmacists probably go through on a daily basis (still most of them are judgemental dickheads).  my buddy ended up being charged with 5 felonies, one for each fentanyl patch he admitted to taking that day.  luckily he got an amazing lawyer and due to first offender status he got 5 yrs of probation.

the second story was about these two dudes who held up a pharmacy in my town 5 years ago or so.  these two guys waited until a small local pharmacy was about to close and went inside with masks on and tied up two or three employees at fucking gunpoint.  they asked for all of the dilaudid and oxycodone 30's the pharmacy had in stock and ended up getting away with these gallon sized jugs of D4s, D8s, and roxis.

this kid i knew who i guess was a customer of one of them was telling me the details that the newspaper didnt have.  apparently after they robbed the pharmacy and left the people ziptied, they went to my buddys apartment and sold him a shit ton of D8s for like $5 a pill (this was a year or two after they used to be $8 here and people were wisening up to their value for IV addicts and they ballooned to fucking $40 an 8) so he knew something was up.  then later on the next day the drug task force kicked my buddys apartment door down and were asking questions about the pharmacy robbery which my buddy had no idea about as the story had just broke and he didnt hear about it yet.  the police i guess had some tips as to who had done it and dropped the two guys' names and my buddy immediately knew what was going on and was scared shitless.  the two guys told him they were staying at a local motel and my buddy dropped that info, so not even 2 days after the robbery these two dudes ended up getting caught.

as you can imagine they were railroaded in court and both of them got 15-20 years, which is probably reasonable considering what they did.  thats all i have to share for now, does anybody else have any cool stories?",1503155231.0

I thought it was stupid and never did it the 3 years I was on maintenance, I never needed to because I was stabilized on 95mg a day.

Fast forward through going to prison, getting back on heroin and then finally entering maintenance therapy again in February. They don't listen any more. It took me three months to get them to raise it to the minimum maintenance dose. They did everything,they could to stop me. Now they told me they won't ever raise it past 60mg because I had a clean ua (i was using tramadol to make it through the week until I could so,intake). I have also been dealing with horrible chronic back pain.

So I tried shooting it. I only have one 1ml 29g rig. It takes 6 shots to get the 60mg down. It's a completely different feeling than taking it orally.. Its so warm and fuzzy. Itchy bliss. It feels very similar to H.

I'm not sure what she's on now but it's either Vicodin, Methadone, or Hydrocodone. 

She's had issues of ""getting high"" before where she becomes drowsy, slurred speech, nods off, talks about nonsense, and sometimes just freezes still. She'll get like this 5 or 6 times a year and it will last about a week. She will say it's not her medicine it's just that she's tired, or other meds are making her drowsy. She'll usually get pretty upset and say ""it's not the fucking meds I'm just tired"", but she can't go to bed bc insomnia. 

I guess to give more info she's on trazedone, xanax, cymbalta, lyrica, bp meds, prob some other shit too.

She's never been a seeker to go out and buy drugs, she only takes what the doctor gives her each month, but I don't know how long that lasts her. 

I ask for help because she got ""high"" the other day at work and nodded off and nobody could snap her out of it and of course she couldn't drive. This isn't the first time it's happened and patience is running thin. She has a good office job making about 50k and losing it would seriously put us in shambles. She's not a bad person (as I'm sure most addicts aren't either) but this behavior is a poison to her professional career and our relationship and it's pretty aggravating to have to care over your mother like a toddler when this happens. 

I am asking a few questions to you guys in hope of you giving me some answers/guidance to difficult situation. 

Do you think she's doing this on purpose to get high or interaction with other medicine?

Should I take away the pills and have a serious talk with her about how losing her job would seriously affect us?

Should I take her to the hospital/go to the doctors with her and explain in person to a medical professional?

Could this just be normal behavior for someone with extreme insomnia on an opiate? (Goes 36 hours without sleeping sometimes)

If you guys need any more info I'll try my best to answer. I'm sorry for poor formatting doing this from a phone. Thanks for any help. 

Edit: I read the community info and after seeing ""suboxone"" I'm 95% sure that's what she's on. ",1503154297.0

So I am a college student in NY, and was curious about if it would be a good idea to try and obtain some. I have health insurance, and as I understand it you can get narcan without a prescription at the pharmacy. A friend told me this story the other day about seeing a woman in a hospital parking lot who had just injected. Is it common to go to a hospital to inject? I mean it does make sense. When my friend saw her she was slouched over with the needle still in her arm. He was able to awake her as he approached the car, and she assured him he was fine, and drove off. The whole situation got me thinking that maybe it might be a good idea to carry narcan, in case I am ever in a similar situation, but aren't able to get the individual to respond... Was just curious on what everyone's thoughts are on the matter. ",1503151509.0

I haven't re-ordered yet. It took a lot of willpower but here I am, Saturday morning, with no opiates to put in my body. I feel OK. I'm going to get some shit done today that I've been putting off. 

I gazed back into the mirror of junkiehood and looked away. Now I'm looking forward. I wonder if I'll look back again? Not this weekend. I'm alive, finally had a good poop (hallelujah!!) and feel light as a feather.

I am a 27 year old poly drug user and have been since 14 in order to self mediate for severe depression. The best I have gotten from this is temporary relief, and the rest of the time spent in sobriety is genuinely agonizing emotionally. 

Now, I would use heroin in small amounts as an anti-depressant, however that is not viable long term, as we all know. Sooner or later something will go wrong and the downward spiral kicks in big time.

I have tried multiple anti-depressants, all of which either did not help, or helped with some symptoms, but left me with a number of other very unpleasant one.

So, to the point of this post, and why it is in this section; has anyone had success with bupe being used off label for depression? The one time I used 8mg IV, I felt normal, pleasant, and able to go about life, whereas I normally lay about in bed as much as possible until I can manage the drive to town to buy the low quality poppy seeds in my area, just so I can get some relief. This is no way to live, and being that many of us have self-medicated with opiates in particular, I would very much appreciate any feedback, or stories about how any of you dealt with a similar situation. I am very desperate, and cannot at this point live a life without being high, in some fashion, and unfortunately, only benzos and opiates work for my mental illness.

Basically, I am reaching out here because I know from reading thousands of posts that many of you are living like I am, or have been doing so, and I would greatly value input from people walking this road.

A lady owed her dboy $500 during a time in her life when she was shooting up roxies. She wanted to pawn a $1500 but her dboy didn't want to take the risk of driving her to the pawn shop in case it was a stolen diamond necklace. The lady's husband wouldn't let her drive the car anymore due to the progression of her addiction.

&nbsp;

As a result, she managed to convince her connect to credit her three roxies so that she wouldn't be dopesick when she went to the pawn shop. The collateral she offered and was accepted by the dboy, her son. So she runs to the pawn shop, gets back home and asks the dboy, ""where'd you go?"" The connect indicates that he had to do some deliveries and that he'd be back soon. Furthermore, her husband was due back in an hour! 

&nbsp;

The dboy assured her that he'd be back before or by 6pm. Of course, knowing what we know about dealer time, he wasn't back at 6. In fact, came back 9AM the next day. The good news is, it turns out the dboy was a family friend and the kid was happy and comfortable to be with this person. 

Turned out the guy had to reup earlier than planned which required him to drive to a distant state and by the time he got there it was so late it was safer to sleep in a hotel room. ",1503124304.0

For our past is what has shaped us into the individuals we are today, and without our previous years we would have never learned anything at all. But when that first hit draws you in, somewhere along the way...you almost do, in fact, let go if it.

...Or do you? 

This question can be hard to answer...because what you valued and held dear may be deeply overshadowed by the instant gratification you now have at your fingertips. Why should it matter? And after the 3rd relapse...there's likely no point in trying, right? Obviously you aren't cut out for this, right?

But...one more relapse can be another step further to freedom, and when others say ""opiate withdrawals won't kill you"", they are both lying and telling the truth at the same time. For the withdrawals are unlikely to kill you, yet at the same time they can rot you to your very core, shaking what's left of your fragile psyche. But no worries...these people are not who you are getting sober for, rather for you and anyone else who cares for you.  And it will take a while, no doubt, to heal after the physical withdrawals are over. Things will seem dull and dreary. It will seem as pointless as ever.

Thing is, this time it ain't even 100% on my end - normally I'd get my next month's RX Sunday, but my Dr. went with a new automatic system that sends ongoing C2's out on the 30th day - which means six days of WD's, as I just found out about it this week.

The thing of it is, I'm not 100% I'm gonna survive this one - too many days to make it, and my life sucks too much as of now. I'll certainly try, but easier said than done having gone through it way too many times as is, and I know exactly what to expect/it ain't gonna get any better before those six days are up. The days of convincing myself ""it's all in your head/downhill from here"" are long f***ing gone.

Even worse, I feel like, through experience/knowhow, I already know most of the ""tips"" - none of which available for me do a hill of beans. I suppose if you've got the fortitude, it's one thing - I, at this point, don't. Thus my swearing ""never again"" and having largely succeeded this past year in stretching just enough.

Today I even considered the route I've never even contemplated, which is just biting the bullet and getting enough H to get me through. The thing there is, I have absolutely shit all idea what I'd be doing or how to do it - never even tried weed, much less had any interactions/connections of the not so legal variety. Even worse still, I guess my best option for ""trolling around"" would be SE DC - which is where people like me really do go to die. :)

So since that route, which at this point seems the only one I can come up with, *really* doesn't seem available to me (if I didn't die, having zilch instinct, I'd prolly be first in line to the friendly Mr. LEO.), what really are my options? Believe me, I'd kill to have some Lyrica on hand - but no such luck. And the whole ""constant showers""/sex endorphins do jack squat. Likewise, I'm not about to lose my legit access by being like/resorting to, ""Hey, I'm going through Opi WD, and the alternative is a noose around the neck"" since, as a legit chronic pain patient, ever losing that would mean the exact same damn thing.

Part of what really sucks for me is my tolerance - this past week has been my monthly ""stretch it out and pray"" week: Any less than 25mg Oxycodone in my system, and I'm in full out WD. So, I'd imagine, as bad as most can imagine WD to be, when you've got my tolerance after nearly 25 yrs of 24/7/365, believe you me, it can indeed still feel even more like shit.",1503104392.0

6ulslr,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6ulslr/purple_dope/,14,https://redd.it/6ulslr,DRUGS_ARE_USEFUL,Purple Dope?,"So, I had some dope I got from some guy a while back that was purple. It wasnt totally purple, it was like a purple with a grey undercolor (is that even a word?) to it. 

Anyway, as soon as I saw it I figured it was straight fentanyl and never got it again. Apparently my friend who really liked that stuff is getting it again and says it's the best shit she's had in a long time. I was stoked about this high quality dope she was talking about, up until she said it was purple. It's apparently got some nice long legs. She said she did a shot at like noon and was really high until almost 9pm. So I figure it's gotta be some other fent analogue which actuall has legs to it. 

Anyone ever see any of this elusive purple dope that my friend seems to love so much? I have a serious aversion to anything fentanyl and have made it a point to only buy brown dope and maybe sometimes grey shit because I used to get amazing grey heroin that was actually heroin back in the day. This has made it more difficult to acquire my current DOC because some dboys never get legit brown pow anymore, sadly. I have one guy that knows that if it's not brown then it's probably fent so he's been acquiring brown drugs so he never has to worry about his clients dying and possibly dealing with a manslaughter charge, or just so he doesn't have to worry about having one less customer (more likely).

For those post the general consensus was that it's a bad idea and my idea is probably a bad one too, but I need to ask so I can get it to stop rattling around in my brain. 

So background: my guts are paralyzed and I'm dependent on IV nutrition and fluids. I have a power port in my chest that goes into my right IJ. I've had my port for almost two year. I do all my own line care and have all the supplies I need to take care of and use my line. I know how to keep shit sterile. 

So here's my idea. My veins are shit, but I want to IV some H. I have some extra filter needles that came with my epi kit. If I use filters and take the same care I would I I were putting anything else in my line how bad of an idea would it be to use my line to IV H? Everything would be sterile except the H and with my line being an IJ it would have to travel a little farther to get to my heart than say a subclavian line. 

I know it's not the smartest idea, but just how bad of an idea is it? 

I've been on rx opiates (morphine) for a while and have sniffed H in the past, but It's been a while. Fent is everywhere around here, so I would be using test strips and going slow of course.  ",1503097476.0

I had been trying to stay clean, chip occasionally, but I've used twice in the last five months, and it was over a month in between. Well i felt the guilt when I looked at my bank account the next day after doing speedballs all night and saw I was almost 200 down, so I decided no more.

I ordered some etizolam and figured I'll take a small amount of this with a single glass of wine and go to sleep whenever I get a craving. Well my boy who partakes in the benzos and wants me to stay clean off dope and gave me a 1mg clonazolam pill, I was already off an etiz 2mg fucked up, so i didnt look up how strong they were. BLacked out, and two days later got a butt load of kratom in the mail. turns out I ordered it while blacked out. Fuck it, I'll research it and try it, even though I've tried before and had no real effects.

Thought it was one of those things people on reddit or people who have never shot dope crack and meth get their pussies wet for. Well let me tell you, I am a fan. After ~5 years of using heroin and anything else you can shoot, I have now found that I enjoy the feeling that this plant gives me. 

A heavy red vein mix like a bentuangie and a red bali or hulu, about 5 grams mixed with orange juice, and down the hatch. Within 20 minutes I feel an opiate like buzz but with something more, I feel warmer and I nod harder in a way, like easier to nod out but I'm not drooling and falling over, and after a month of use my dose is the same and I still nod. Green veins make me nod if i'm just sitting, but they are really stimulating and motivating if I'm doing any kind of work. White vein is just all around euphoric stimulation. Love the feeling more than my adderall script or even meth or crack, and it's got me more productive. 

Plus I've been using Kratom all day every day for about a month like 3-5 times a day and the withdrawals (of course I get withdrawals, it plays on your mu-opioid receptors somewhat and I've been doing dope for 5 years) from kratom are nowhere near as bad as heroin. I feel like tired and maybe a bit of that uhgk opiate withdrawal feeling, but honestly, a bit of coffee makes me feel better, or an adderall. 

Also I quit smoking cigs within like 2 days of using kratom and cut out weed almost entirely during the day, smoke it once at night and not even every night. Feel motivated to stick to what I've been doing to better myself (vitamins, working out, studying, saving my money up) since I started taking it. I also cut back on benzos a ton.

My point is this, everyones body chemistry is different and for me it turns out kratom is somehow more enjoyable of a feeling. I'm about to try legit kava + some nootropics along with microdosing mushrooms and see if I cant get a good cycle so I'm not physically dependent on kratom, and keep that tolerance down.

Anyone else switch to kratom from years of heroin and other IV drugs and actually like it more? ",1503083311.0

I had a relapse. Tomorrow I start again with the methadon program. End of the year I could get a transfer from my company and work in the US. 

Can someone please explain to me how the system in the US works?

Here in Europe you can get Methadone or subutex or subuxone by every physician that has the license for opioid addiction treatment. The insurance covers the costs. If you don't take simultaneously  H or other drugs you get every week a prescription for the whole week (take home).


I.) How does it work in the US?

II.) Where do I have to go first?



My new job in the US would be in Florida or in California.


III.) If if don't get the job, i think about to start a company in Florida or California. In this case: would I have to cover the costs for the methadon/subutex/suboxone program by me self or would my insurance cover the costs? 

I'm happy about every info.

i dont want to be a buzzkill but i really need help and feel like im backed into a corner for many reasons let me explain.

i was living in a city and ended up doing H getting subs waiting 16 hours i was fine no percipitated withdrawl nothing everything was golden. my induction worked i had a great doc he saved my life.

Unfortunatly, i had to move cities my doctor passed away, i couldnt get anymore scripts and going from a big city to basically the country i didnt have many options. unfortunatly i started doing fet when i moved to this new city or what i think it is.. 

so i tried to induce myself again i waited 19 hours took 2 mgs and got perciptated withdrawl i know i was fucking stupid i was just used to taking my subs at 16hours and being fine. Well i had to use more fet so the p/w would stop half the internet told me to take more subs and half told me to do more fet.
It helped next day i felt okay but bupes have a long half life and my metabolisim is shit. 

i wait 2 weeks i try again this time i eat healthy drink water prepare myself i waited 36 hours and i did the cow scale i was at a 26. This time i literally took a crumb maybe .1 or .2 out of a 8mg sub i went into hardcore i want to die percipitated withdrawls for 10 hours i didnt take more subs or fet at that point. i waited 12 hrs to take more fet. I have no clue what this shit is the D man is saying its fet but i doubt it how could it last this long i thought fet doesnt have a long half life especially since i wasnt using patches.

I am so scared now because this is 2 times in a row and even a 26 on the cow scale and a crumb after 36 hours put me into hell noone could tell me shit not any docs not the hospital noone so im coming to you because i know most of you know more about bupes and shit than doctors themselves...
im pretty sure what i am taking is some kindof synthetic designer opiate parfetanol i mean i didnt start feeling like bad bad till 36hours and i know time doesnt mean shit but i took subs before when i had h and fet mixed together in 16hours like i said before.

Do i try again??. i dont have insurance and if i got it i probably would habe to wait 30 days to get into detox im not sure if thats correct.. i feel like i cant do this myself and this bumfuck town has nothing other than a methadone clinic and 2 really shitty detoxes..
im just asking for advice i got offered to get a bridge put on for 3500 says it takes 85% of withdrawl symptoms away. Induce myself again or pray to get into a detox if i get insurance i dont know if my body can take another p/w im small and im anemic as well i dont want pity and dont want to be a buzzkill if anyone has any suggestions or have heard or tried something similar like i said its pure white draws up clear or it has a slight pink tint also it burns badly and if you do is nasily there is so gunk ive never experienced anything like it. Anyway thanks for listening to my ramble and sorry about being a buzzkill i just know this maybe a place i can get some solid advice thanks ",1503203018.0

The reason I prefer this combo over either or is I find opiates too sedating most of the time and like to counteract the lethargy and keep my focus, as I also suffer from quite severe ADD and sometimes I can't even have a conversation without my mind drifting off, feeling like an idiot when I realize I didn't absorb a word of what someone just told me.

I worry for my health though, and though I maintain the same tolerance long term, I don't know if it's slowly harming me more than just doing opiates does.

been a lurker on reddit for years now and finally committed to making an account, because some of these threads are just too good to not participate in.

i know so many people who have spent a ton of money on 30's and whatnot..the other day i was picking up with a friend who kept getting texts from his dad about stolen money...womp womp. it had me thinking a lot like.. how ill never understand how people who don't work can afford their pill addiction, and why this kid would continue buying 40mg+/day and not just resort to diesel..

well anyway it made me relive the lovely time a few years ago when you could actually score some deals on a few jawns. maybe even get them for $20 a piece! but now paying less than $1/mg is like pulling teeth, and I'm assuming this is how things are everywhere nowadays.

once i start thinking about this stuff i get stuck on trying to calculate how much I've spent on these little suckers. i don't have a very high tolerance so over the past three or so years I've probably bought anywhere from 2-5 30's a week (give or take a few weeks) and of course this wasn't always in the form of a 30 (unfortunately) because my guy often gets tens and teens too, especially now...if he has a 215's it's like a celebration for my friends and i, heheh.

now I'm just rambling, but hopefully someone will reply and share some stories :) my calculations have me somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000, which i guess is not too terribly bad in comparison to what it could be if my tolerance was higher. still gets me every time though. if only i could get my hands on a lifetime supply for free LMAO .
