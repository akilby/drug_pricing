7u3k6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7u3k6y/is_addiction_a_disease/,19,https://redd.it/7u3k6y,Strongcook,Is Addiction A Disease?,"I recently found myself reading an online debate about this topic and some people were ruthless and had no sympathy for addicts. I get that some people feel that way- The National Center of Addiction and Substance Abuse defines addiction as:
“Addiction is a complex disease of the brain and body that involves compulsive use of one or more substances despite serious health and social consequences. Addiction disrupts regions of the brain that are responsible for reward, motivation, learning, judgment and memory. It damages various body systems as well as families, relationships, schools, workplaces and neighborhoods.”
https://www.centeronaddiction.org/what-addiction/addiction-disease
People argued that the addict chooses to try the drug and therefore is responsible for their reckless behavior/they are not victims of an addiction. What about people who get hooked from a doctors prescription-it can be as innocent as a small script after wisdom teeth removal to trigger an addiction. 
So I know how I feel- I have had my own struggles with addiction & watch the show Intervention (I know a watching a show doesn’t make me an expert—- also I have another post about the show Intervention and their work in the Heroin Triangle) and strongly do feel it’s a compulsive disease that needs treatment or over time it can lead to death or other dangerous health issues. I get that to some maybe even most that perhaps comparing addiction to say a child who has cancer who has “no choice” is absurd. However what the definition above is saying is that the addict has no choice either bc their brain chemistry changes. 

So in your opinion, why or why not, is addiction a disease? ",1517340409.0
7u3h2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7u3h2o/fda_acts_to_stem_misuse_abuse_of_loperamide/,7,https://redd.it/7u3h2o,UntidyGuy,"FDA Acts to Stem Misuse, Abuse of Loperamide","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced new action today to combat the growing problem of abuse and misuse of the over-the-counter (OTC), opioid-based antidiarrheal medication loperamide (Imodium, Johnson & Johnson), which is placing individuals at risk for cardiac dysrhythmia and death.
To foster safe use of loperamide, the FDA is working with manufacturers to use blister packs or other single-dose packaging and to limit the number of doses in a package, the agency said.
The FDA is asking manufacturers of loperamide, which is available OTC and by prescription, to change the way they label and package loperamide to ""stem abuse and misuse that leaves us deeply concerned,"" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, MD, said in a statement.
In 2016, the FDA warned about life-threatening cardiac events, including QT interval prolongation, torsades de pointes or other ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and cardiac arrest, with loperamide misuse and abuse, as reported by Medscape Medical News.  In 2017, the FDA added a warning to the product label about the risk of taking high doses of loperamide. 

The FDA notes that some individuals are taking higher-than-recommended doses of loperamide to treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal or to achieve euphoric effects of opioid use.
The maximum approved daily dose for adults is 8 mg/day for OTC use and 16 mg/day for prescription use. Loperamide is safe at these approved doses, but the FDA continues to receive reports of serious cardiac problems and deaths with much higher than the recommended doses of loperamide, primarily among people who are intentionally misusing or abusing the product, the agency said.
Packaging Could Help

Evidence suggests that package limitations and use of unit-dose packaging may reduce medication overdose and death, Dr Gottlieb said. Today the agency sent letters to OTC manufacturers requesting that they implement changes consisting of packaging limitations and unit-of-dose packaging.


""We're requesting that packages contain a limited amount of loperamide appropriate for use for short-term diarrhea according to the product label. One example is a single retail package containing eight 2-milligram capsules in blister packaging. We asked the manufacturers to take the necessary steps to implement these changes in a timely fashion to address these public health concerns,"" Dr Gottlieb said.
He said the FDA will also reach out to those who distribute loperamide online through retail websites to ask them to take voluntary steps to help address the problem of loperamide abuse. ""The abuse of loperamide requires the purchase of extremely large quantities. Often this is done through the purchase of large bottles of loperamide, which is a common configuration in which the pill form of the medication is currently packaged. Today's action is intended to change how the product is packaged, to eliminate these large volume containers. We know that many of the bulk purchases of these large volumes are being made online through major online web retailers,"" Dr Gottlieb explained.

I know I have. Burnt by dealers, middle men, cops, other junkies, etc. But has there ever been a time you just fucked yourself and no one to blame but you?

My example or story was a few months ago. I took my lunch break to pick up 2 buns. This was pretty normal. I had taken my break to pick up before, I'm able to do it in the amount of time needed, my guy picked up and was waiting for me. So I go, pick up, do a few on the way back to the train, and get on. Everything seems fine. All went well, right? Well...i get off at my stop and while I'm walking up to the doors, I realize my pack of smokes (which I put the buns in) wasn't in my pocket. I had put the pack in my hoodie pocket. I searched all my pockets like a crazy person, retraced my steps back, and get down in time to see the train pulling away. I realize the pack fell out while I was sitting on the train. Fuck. I just lost 16 bags. They're on this fucking train that just pulled off going to Penn Station. My mind is racing, trying to think what to do. There's a fucking pack of smokes sitting on that train with 5 cigs and 16 bags. I tried figuring out how I could get to that train before they cleaned it or someone swiped them. I thought maybe I could wait for the train to come back and catch it. But how would I know what train? Which car? Which track? There's no way I'd be able to find the right train at the right time AND someone hadn't picked them up already. I had no recourse. Not to mention I had to get back to work, so I couldn't just chill at the train station all day hoping the same train came back to this station. There was nothing I could do and they were gone, traveling the city by themselves on this train, destined to be someone else's high. 

The only thing I could think is ""someone is going to have a GREAT day finding that pack."" lol

SO, I didn’t have access to a vehicle when this all took place, thus I got an Uber to take me into the nearest city (which is approximately an hour away) and had him drop me off at spot set up by my d-boy. After some mild confusion (which actually had my dude laughing at me as opposed to being annoyed/pissy with me, which was nice) I met up with him, picked up my shit, and started back towards a spot where I could easily pick up another Uber to take me home. 

Unfortunately for me, there were ZERO businesses around with a public restroom. And if you think I was gonna wait until I took the hour ride back home to rip into a couple of those puppies then you’re fucking crazy, mate. LOL. So, as I’m tooling around these side streets and alleyways, my dumbass rolls a twenty up into a tooter, rips open 5 bags, dumps ‘em out onto my phone, and then quickly dips beside some rando’s garage and snorts those babies down... er... up. Whatever. 

Looking back on it, I’m pretty damn lucky nothing went wrong! There were people milling about all over the place, so it was quite the “bold” (fucking stupid) move on my behalf.

I’m gonna test Dramamine and meclizine next assuming those are save at all to inject, and then I will try Cyclizine once my technique is point.

I know at my highschool I was paying 5 bucks for 40s, 5 bucks for 80s sometimes, and often getting free pills for little favors and fun.  In that environment, it did not take long to become quite addicted to oxycodone. It was months of use before my first taste of withdrawals, but when they did hit, damn.

      I remember being home alone, luckily, and just not able to be comfortable. Hot and colds. Fucking bone pain. Rage. Crazy RLS. Fiending.You know. After that experience, I tried to manage my sources a little more carefully and started my habit of immediately hitting up dude after school. Somehow, I managed to keep my scholarship, but to assure my receiving it I still had to go tutor second or third graders at the end of my day, sometimes sick as fuck...And those kids, man, they knew something was not right. It was beyond fucked.
   
      That's also about the time I started listening to my Dad's collection of John Prine and began to be haunted by the song ""Sam Stone"", and began to realize I was a junkie.
Fast forward a few months to graduation, I blew 2 80s right before and looked like a fucked up ghost, barely able to walk. The resulting photo of me receiving my diploma was, needless to say, horrific. 
  
     As you can imagine, it wasn't long before I began thinking about the needle. Promises of better highs and lower usage and all that. Thank God I was aware of the extreme danger I was playing with and after failing due to not tying off properly, said fuck that. A nicely deviated septum it would be. 

     Apparently observed by angels, I discovered a solid Methadone connect in yet another one of my young peers from school. Soon freed of my increasingly expensive oxy habit of 60-80 dollars a day, I actually starting doing much better. I was using my scholarship at least. 
   
     So I started on Methadone right before 2004. 2004 is also when my future wife and I began living together. Thank the makers she wasn't a junkie too.  By 2008, I knew I had to get off the shit, but I had no idea how.    By this time I didn't even know how many of what pills I was doing.  To get a handle on my situation, I started a Pill Journal, trying to document myself for myself.

     I did this with varying success for 3 years before I finally got to that famous place all good junkies eventually enter. I fully understood what being sick and tired of being sick and tired meant. 
     
     Finally, through a series of divinely fortunate events, I got an excellent opportunity to quit in March of 2011.  It started with a dinner with my then soon-to-be fiancee who I had somehow managed to hang onto. We're having drinks, waiting for our server, and next thing I know I'm nodded out, waking up to a super angry soon-to-be fiancee.  See, I'd gotten very good about not committing the sin of nodding, and had managed to stay on my girl's good side because of this. Now, I hadn't nodded in a public place in a good while, and doing so for the first time in a while was suddenly, extremely embarrassing.  Next day I went out to help my mom and consciously halved my dose so as to avoid ""The Conversation about Methadone"". Which of course we talked about. Leaving my mom's on my reduced dose, listening to some song about marriage, I realized if I was to get married, is have too get clean.

So I did. The next day, I hung out with my best friend, who didn't approve of my use at all. Again at half my usual dose, I realized I had been tapering for 2 days, so I might as well keep on it.     
     
    This was my chance to quit and I fully embraced it. I kept halfing my Done till I could take morphine. I halved the morphine till it was a few milligrams. I spent the next month feeling crazy, but I got better. On my brother in law's birthday in early April I took nothing, but was able to eat. A month later I felt like my head was screwing itself back on, and every day I got a little better.

     Now free from my demons for the first time in my adult life, I got to work. Asked my girls Dad for permission to marry his beautiful daughter. I bought a $5000 Tacori engagement ring. Bought a $9000 wedding package at a Couple's resort in Negril. Life was great. I was getting married to the love of my life and things were amazing.  

      This lasted almost 6 months.  AND THEN.....I got hurt. We were on a float trip. There was rope swing. Ok. I swung out of the tree like a dozen people before me, but landed on a jagged-ass rock, and gashed a hole in my leg. I  bleed for 5 hours. After 2 days it still hurt like hell, remarkably it wasn't broken though. I started to think opiates would help, and tracked down some morphine. 

To be continued, I'm  wishing I could fucking  sleep tonight but I'm gonna keep trying.",1517294809.0

Holy shit though. I can't believe I've made it this far. I didn't think I was going to be able to, forreal. I know that everyone around me didn't think I could do it either. 

I've never done 100% abstinence before. And it's crazy how it's getting easier every day as things even out.

I had completely accepted that I was a junkie no matter what and I was going to either die in an overdose or get killed  by a john or in some other fucked up situation. 

I never thought that I had a chance at a normal life. But now I'm starting to see that it is possible for me to stay clean. That maybe I won't die young. That there is hope. 

I'm not saying I'm going to be perfect or stay clean forever, but I'm going to for quite a while. I'm not going back anytime soon. 

There is hope guys. Seriously.

I was put on 16 mg of suboxone a day exactly two weeks ago, and having been down this road before I know I only need 8mg a day to feel normal. So this last Saturday the 27th, I once again fell to my vice and copped half a gram.  I hadnt taken my subs for about 30 hours so I definitely felt it, probably around 80% of its strength. 

Now prior to me getting on subs, the dope I was getting was definitely fent laced, I know this only because I would get sick a measly 5-7 hours after a shot, not because of its strength, it was pretty weak, like a 4 out of 10.  But the dope I got on Saturday was from an old connect that went dry months ago because he actually had a conscious and wouldnt sell any dope laced with fent.  He calls me (unaware of me being on subs) saying hes back with his original product which is about a 9 out of 10, easily the best Ive ever had, and I succumb.

Sorry for the long rant, heres my question.  I did the last of the dope yesterday morning around 10am, a tiny line and a cotton from the night before, just to get a little buzz, was FAR from what I could do. This was the same dope I was doing probalby 6 months ago, and would start to WD around the 16 hour mark. But its been about 29-30 hours since then, and I have zero withdrawal symptoms, not even sneezing-which was always first for me.  I desperately want to get back on my subs, but am terrified of precipitated WDs.  Is it safe for me to take a sub tonight? Every site on heroin WD says they kick in 8-24 hours after last shot.  Has anyone ever had similar experiences?

i have been on and off probation about 4-5 years the past 10 yrs or so. i have smoked, dope, etc etc the whole time thru probation. the Stinger Detox drink is the absolute best one..used to be 20 bucks now its 40 but whatever.

u can do all teh drugs in the world up until 48 hrs before your tests. you gotta be clean those 48 hrs then you drink the bottle and 16 oz of water i think it is, do this about 1-2 hrs before ur test. u have a window of i think its 4-6 hrs after u drink it that you will piss clean. i have used this so many times it wqs a godsend.

also i have cut it close before my piss tests and used dope and weed up until 36 hrs of the test. i drank it and somehow still passed...i was such a dumbass but it worked

I started escorting when I was almost 18 to get away from my parents. They weren't abusive but I felt suffocated. They used their money as leverage and it made me feel like shit. I bounced around on the East Coast for a bit but after a serious depressive episode I moved back to the midwest to live with them. It was about 3 months after my 18th birthday when I moved back with them. I enjoyed the lack of responsibility, the lack of rent, bills, etc. Not having to escort to pay my bills was a big weight off my shoulder. It was during this time that I started injecting heroin. I also overdosed for the first time in my life. A few months later I moved out again but got an apartment just 10 miles from them. I burned through my cash fast and at this point I was sober and going to AA. Well of course I relapsed soon after I moved. I went to the psych ward and then got high for a while. I eventually joined an intensive outpatient program which helped a lot. About 5 months after I moved into this apartment I decided I had enough of this small, grey town and picked up my stuff and moved to the Southwest. I started attending community college which made my parents happy. In return they covered my living expenses. Of course here I relapsed. I started escorting again and using heroin but neither of the two stuck. I would have short binges of both activities but mainly focus on school. I began to become really unhappy. I hadn't made any friends that stuck around and spent most of my time holed up in my apartment. I was now 19. People at my school weren't too friendly. I would start doing heroin every few months for a few days. I would escort here and there to bring in extra cash. I made the decision to drop out of school about 6 months after I moved to the Southwest. I packed up my shitty 18 year old beater car and drove it all the way up the coast. I landed in a new city. No job or school lined up. Lots of cash in savings from escorting, no real relationship with my parents at this moment. I moved in with this random girl and to be honest I feel really lonely. My landlord just texted me and made it clear this apartment wasn't even a done deal so I have all my shit here and I might have to move out tomorrow. Nice. I would like a normal job but I have to pay for a surgery that I need. So I guess I'm just gonna be escorting to pay my bills and keep my savings up. I don't know. I'm stressed and lonely. I want to get high, but I want it to be different. I would always get high alone or with this one girl who was dumb as fuck back south. Either way wasn't very fun. I wish I could just meet some chill people and fuck around with them. I'm over it. I'll be 20 this summer.

And that's all fine and dandy until you find yourself saying the same exact thing, 1-2 weeks later? You have to remove any expectations for what you would consider the worst, because there's no such thing. There's no ceiling to how bad things can get, and your expectations are only disappointment sitting idle. I would say dying is as bad as it gets but some days it's the only solution I can come up with. I would never do it by the way. 

It's immediate situation and drawn out situation after immediate situation and drawn out situation. After enough shitshows played through you look back and realize it was too long ago that you became desensitized. Disaster is now the norm and shit storms are as close to break time as you'll get.

Well, right after I started copping off that dude, he got a new batch and the quality was horrible. So I started going through the middle again because he had some other connects with absolute FIRE. Real dope, no fent or anything. 

Today, when we get to the street we're meeting the plug on, the middle says ""I told him you're from (very, very rich/ snobby suburb of our hometown that is already considered rich and snobby to begin with), that's why it took us so long to get here"" 

That's when it occurred to me that he had told his plug he'd be frequently bringing a ""rich white kid"" that he's middling for/ taking advantage of from the suburbs through, in hopes that the plug would throw him a bunch of free bags for the business. ( because he couldn't charge me more than it actually cost anymore, I told him the only way I'd start going through him again is if he only charges me what he's getting it for per bag, and I'd just throw him some bags for the help) 

This is extreme bullshit, because not only am I not from said rich/ snobby suburb, I am NOT rich or anything else fitting the stereotype of the residents of said suburb. I've posted screenshots of how this middle talks to me, demanding I get more money than I can as if I can pull money out my ass. 

He even has told me to steal money from my parents, and tried to get me to pawn my laptop or guitars on the empty promise that he'd pay me back come payday l. 

Anyway, he gets back to my truck and hands me the bundle that he copped for me, and then I look over and the plug is beckoning me over. So I walk over to his car, ignoring the middle asking me ""wtf I'm doing."" When I get to the window, his plug asks for my number so he can send me his info, then hands me a completely free bundle, despite being told that I'm some rich white kid. 

Of course, the whole ride back to his house, the middle is bitching at me, telling me it's not safe and that I need to keep going through him if I don't want to risk my life and all this stupid, racist shit. Bitch, I lived in the hood for 6-7 years when I lived off campus for school, including 2 separate trap houses. And that whole last year living up there, I was cold copping just about every day. Pretty sure I can handle myself.  

So I now have not one, but two of this middle who tried to violate my shit's main plugs. It was a good day, r/opiates. 

PS I'm sure some of you are going to tell me that this plug only wanted my number because he believed the middle about me being a rich white kid from a really expensive suburb. When he texted me his info so I'd have it, I made it abundantly clear that my financial status and location were greatly exaggerated. He said doesn't care, as long as I'm regularly copping off him.

Right now I'm weak. Depressed. Broke. Alone in a foreign country. He saw that. Has been watching me preying like a lion. Then tried to strike. Acted like he was trying to be nice. 
 
I thought he just wanted to be a good friend. I only hung out with him for a total of 8 hours. Initially talked to him because he knows dealers and I'm tryna get rid of some subs. Said he could help. Obviously did not have sex with him not that it matters. Only thing he bought me was a pack of cigs but at the end of the 8 hours he acted like I was indebted to him. 

Now he's blowing up my shit ringing my apartment building door ringer thing and he told me ""u have a problem and you don't know it"" I've ignored him since. He also told me he's watching me on the camera. 

Thank god i talked to a good friend after hanging out with the creep. The friend advised (thank you I'll always be grateful for you, you know who you are)  me to stay away and knocked some sense into me because I always assume people have good intentions and if dope isn't involved I'm the one that gets manipulated. 

MY WOMEN AND SISTERS BE FUCKING CAREFUL. ITS NOT A SAFE WORLD FOR US. IM IN THE ""first world"" there are predators EVERYWHERE. 

Also don't get the wrong idea I'd die before prostituting myself. It'll never happened has never happened. He really would have had to abduct me. But imagine if it was a girl that was slightly more desperate. What a piece of shit. 

What kills me the most is all his friends saw what was happening knew he was trying to meet and groom a new girl into the life and no one said a thing. How could people just let this shit happen. 

I've been worried he'll break into my apartment do something as a warning like kill my cats. Abduct me. Dude it's half paranoia half fears based on fact and logic. I can't go to the cops I'd also die before being a snitch. 

I told my dealer about this he told me he'll have people on my street look out for me. I can't sleep at night. I'm sorry this isn't opiate related. But I had to share. This is turning out to be a rough year. Im a fucking dumbass. 

I have to be strong. Sigh. Also I gotta move out of the hood.

My advice can extend only as far as my own experience as I'm not a medical professional, so understand that this (and most of the information you read on the internet) is just my own experience.

I was on methadone 80mg/24hrs and I was so sensitive to withdrawal that I'd rock up to the clinic every day with my eyes watering, yawning, with a runny nose and aching everywhere all over my body. I didn't handle any physical or psychological discomfort well at all, which helped lead me toward opiate addiction. Prior to methadone I started with uncontrolled low-dose pharmaceuticals like Neurofen Plus that helped me control symptoms of depression. Of course, barely any time passed before it was Panadine Forte and doctor shopping. After a while, I was ingesting so much ibuprofen and paracetamol that my liver and kidneys started showing the early symptoms of disease.

So, heroin was a logical choice...you know...to 'be healthy'. Haha...I still laugh at that justification, I actually can remember saying it to my dealer who died in a public toilet later that month. There's just enough truth in that particular justification for it to work...so it's kind of genius. I can still hear my internal thoughts about it from back then and I seriously can't help but chuckle. 

'Well mate, congratulations, you've stopped putting that sh*t ibuprofen and paracetamol in your body, it's just pure opiates now which are practically HEALTHY!'

Nek minnit...

Full blow heroin addiction for two years that destroyed my life completely. Sure, the first few months were great. You've heard it a million times, so I won't repeat it too much but EVERYBODY thinks they can have a handle on it. They don't. I'm yet to meet a single person who can control hardcore opiate usage. But the demise of my life is a whole other story, and is none of your concern. You're thinking about kicking so, here's the kicker:

I then tried to rebuild my life (and finances) by going on the methadone program and moving in with my Mum at age 30. I started psyching myself up for rehab as I didn't like how unmotivated and isolated I felt. I wanted to get clean and have a better life for myself. So, the month before rehab, I started using on top of the methadone. Fentanyl patches and snorting china white. I overdosed twice that month and nearly died.

Anyway, when I was in rehab I was going to gradually reduce my dependence and jump off around 5mg. I went in on 80mg and over a week got down to 70mg. Now...this is just me, but I was wondering why I was prolonging the inevitable. One morning, the nurse gave me 7mg instead of 70mg. The doctor had filled my order wrong and it was taking a long time to get her on the line. Something about the chaos of the doctor being unreachable and the nurse refusing to administer my normal taper combined to make me realize that the only solution I had was to take responsibility myself. The thing that made me laugh is that the 75mg dose of the previous day was clearly visible.

I walked out the door a week into the program with only a small reduction to show for it. But here it is...I just stopped taking everything. Completely cold turkey. Here's what I was ingesting daily when leaving rehab.

75mg methadone
150mg sertraline/zoloft
150mg lamotragine
40mg diazepam
20mg tamazepam

I was a cloud of meds, high and unclear.

I would only put food and water in my body from that point on because I was so utterly over the chaos and drama the drugs were causing me. I'd tried to kick before, but this was different. I was taking back control through responsibility. Having said that I felt awful for a month and not quite right for another three after that.

The point is this though...when you're ready to take responsibility, you can kick anything.

I'm not kidding when I say this, but my life turned around so quickly. I got a job I love that pays well, I'm going to the gym regularly, I have an amazing girlfriend who is not only a babe, but a great human and I live in a clean, nice house that I love coming home to. I've been both fortunate and brave. I endured the suffering I had to go through and came to see suffering as something I needed to take on my own shoulders and not shirk or outsource to others.

In short, I'm a man with meaning in my life that isn't overcome with resentfulness or loneliness.

I'm happy to answer any questions, but just know that if you want to take responsibility for yourself and take the burden of living on your own shoulders - it's not only possible to redirect your life to something beneficial for yourself and those around you - it's essential.

I know that kratom is banned in Ireland, and I believe the UK. So that leaves me with two options: lope and codeine. 

Is codeine still OTC in Ireland? Anyone have information about that? 

The problem with lope (which I'm taking currently) is that it sounds like you can't bring much into the country. I bought two of those 200 count bottles, which helps a bit through the withdrawals, but it's not perfect. I take about 20 a day currently. As I said, the withdrawals are bad. But with Ireland, the max you can buy is 20 ct at a time, which would be a huge expense. And you can't bring in bigger bottles than that, according to a lot of forum posts of people in the same situation.

So I could buy it there as the worst case scenario, but I'd really rather not. It would be ridiculously expensive. I don't have much money at all (the trip was completely paid for, never left the country)

So I'm hoping that maybe codeine is still an option there. Not sure how it works OTC, or however it is. 

Any advice from anyone? Thank you for taking the time to read. It's an oddly specific post.",1517264696.0

But I've never found drugs (except for an MDMA capsule once at a rave like 5 years ago and a bag of coke at that same rave which sucked because I didn't do coke). Anyways, yesterday I'm driving home from work and as I'm exiting onto a ramp to the interstate I see a Michael Kors bag on the shoulder of the road. I immediately pulled over and walk the 20 feet back to get it, and then after hopping back in my car and starting to drive again, about 30 feet down I see two prescription bottles so I pull back over and grab them. Now this was super sketchy in terms of safety because it wasn't even a full shoulder as I was still on the ramp going from one Interstate to the next. But back to the important part, one prescription bottle was gabapentin and it still had the sticker on it with all the patient information, the other bottle didn't have a tag and after Googling that pill imprint I was pleasantly surprised to learn I just found 32 morphine sulfate 30mg!!!! I was able to return the Gabapentin to the owner, who was extremely grateful as she had nerve damage from a botched wrist surgery earlier this year, and unfortunately there was enough information from the stuff left in the Michael Kors bag that I will be returning that to its owner this evening. I was honestly hoping the bag would be empty so I could sell it but it had the contact information in a notebook right inside and I have lost my wallet and had it returned far too many times not to pay back that Karma. But the morphine came at the perfect time as I am both trying to cut down/ quit h right now and due to bills I spent my last $20 on some H that lasted me Monday and tuesday, so I was going to have to go to work today in withdrawals. Instead I have a nice little buzz going and I can start tapering tomorrow. 

Also apparently the reason of the bag was on the side of the road is there was a spree of smash-and-grab car robberies the other night and I'm guessing that's where the thiefs started throwing stuff out of their car that they didn't want. But they were some damn shitty thieves considering they threw out a perfect condition Michael Kors bag and a bottle of morphine.

Edit: just copying a comment I made before I get asked/told something related to this multiple time.  **There were multiple people's stuff stolen, and the 30's had no information on them and she never asked about them. If she would have said anything about missing morphine, or the bottle had identifiable info on it, I would have handed them right over.**

But seems like lots of good people, useful info, and entertaining stories to say the least. 

Anyway, to the post. So long story short, I’m a pretty small guy (currently around 5’4 130lbs +/-) I got pretty serious into lifting in high school and through the first year or so of college (until the real addiction started taking hold). In that time I never got very big because I still lacked proper nutrition, etc. but I was very fit and lean. 

Currently, I haven’t been to the gym (or done any real physical activity, except for at work) in at least 8 months, and my diet pretty much consists of heroin, cigarettes, Red Bull, milkshakes, and pretty much anything sweet or terrible for you lol. 

But I feel like I look great! I’m obviously not as toned as I was when I was going to the gym 5 times a week, but I’m still around the same weight, and thin but not “skinny. ” I honestly feel like I look better than I would if I wasn’t using, or going to the gym. 
Not to mention, I seem to have gotten many more compliments on my looks/eyes while high, but that might be a coincidence. 

So what are you guys’ thoughts?

Btw I didn’t really mean for this post to be this long, I finally just got my fix after being sick for the last 3 days on top of recovering from a car wreck 3 days ago, so I’m giddy lol. Also, nice to finally “officially” be a part of the community!

Immediately my throat went red, tasted metallic like blood, and felt sore.  My lungs burned inside.  From maybe 5mg of compound.  I tried several different times but never even got a buzz from it and 24hrs later my throat still hurts.  Vendor ignoring my messages.

They also sold fent as dope to an old acquaintance of S's who ODd from it and fucking died. She shouldn't have let her money walk but we are all fed up with this horrible excuse for a person and so she told me she is going to try and trick them into doing dope cut with a ground up sub pill (maybe more like sub cut with dope, not sure what her plan is exactly). My question is will this even send them into precipitated WD? If one shoots dope and sub at the same time is it a similar effect to taking subs after doing dope? Has anyone ever experienced this, either purposely or accidently or done to you without your knowledge?  


Seems like involuntary precipitated withdrawal is essentially torture, but doesn't leave any (physical) marks and is likely not life threatening. This got me thinking, is there any evidence that governments or other malicious organizations have used this as an actual torture method? Switching between the calm and peace of opiates to the pure hell that is precipitated withdrawal... I can't imagine anything that would be worse especially if it was dragged out over days, weeks, months... Goddamn it's fucked up what people do to people. At the same time, I can't really feel bad if this guy ends up in precipitated withdrawal for an afternoon, would be peanuts compared to what he's done. 


To be clear, it's not me who is planning on doing this, but I am curious about if it will be effective. So, share your experiences with me please my friends. Enjoying some tasty ECP for the first time since the spring rn.

I certainly haven't heard this one yet, but hopefully it's not your first time and can offer some clarity.  I've been on Subs for 8 years now and something odd has happened over the last 12 months that has me freaking out.

The first seven years (or so) I was stable at about 1.2-1.0mg/day without issue.  Suddenly a year ago I started having terrible stomach problems which I can only think was digestive paralysis which caused really bad acid reflux, very poor appetite, etc.  Around that time, I dropped my dose a bit to see if it would help and it did.  Reflux subsided and digestion improved.  However, I ended up right back at the same spot again just a couple weeks later with same 'ol ""taking too much"" symptoms:  not digesting, constipation, sinus congestion, joints not cracking, back pain, low libido, minor headache, too tired, etc.  So I had to lower dose again to steady myself.  This has gone on for 54 charted weeks where I recorded my daily doses and I'm surprised to see that I dropped over 50% from about 6.5mg/week to now less than 3.0/week.  That's right, I'm doing about .5mg per day now in an effort to keep up with what my body is doing, and now I'm at the point that I have trouble getting to sleep, not feeling like I'm taking enough to get through the day, etc.  Each time I've dropped I've had some w/d but lately it's way less intense.  I used to get RLS like crazy but now it's more of just trouble sleeping.  Last week, I lost some hearing in one ear because of how congested I am.  Usually I can drop my dose either for a short while or permanently and the snotfest starts and all sinuses drain.  Didn't happen this time...it's like the w/d aren't even going to start.  

I must be nuts, but are these lower doses that much more powerful?  Or is my brain shutting down not-in-use receptors now?  More importantly, what the hell is my body doing?  Why this forced taper?  It's like I'm fine for 2 weeks after a small drop, and suddenly I'm still on too much.  Could really use some feedback for cause.  The only other thing I take is vitamins and antacid.

I feel like at this point I'm going to have to either stay at a steady dose as long as I can and see if my body re-adjusts (and hope my hearing comes back/sinuses drain/can defecate, etc.), or just try skipping an entire day or two and see if that kickstarts minor w/d because it feels like I wouldn't even get it anymore.   

Anyone out there ever had their tolerance drop automatically like this?  How do I get it back up? ",1517377697.0

He was different from others and he got pain killing plus an energy boost from morphine/h. But that only lasted two weeks.
Any apparent boost in energy the substance was able to provide was only present for two weeks maximum. Then the permanent sleep would start to take hold. 
So although he got energy upon second try, two weeks into the addiction, he was effectively almost permanently asleep. It took him years to learn this only because of how hard the stuff was to get where he was located. 
 He also told me that refined opiates were only mans way to take far too much of a plant that is dangerous enough in its natural form. 
He also told me that bone density loss and hypogonadism are not worth the temporary relief or apparent benefits of even raw opium. Or any of its derivatives.
He was lucky enough to find subutex in a time capsule and tapered off using that once his injuries (the original reason for his use of opioids) healed.

Every other weekend or so (sometimes more, sometimes less) I've had a 30mg roxy.  My rules were:

1. Never on weekdays (unless on vacation).
2. Never when I'm in a bad mood.
3. No more than 3/4 weekends in a row.
4. No more than 2 days in a row.

I also dabbled with Xanax, Klonopin, Dextroamphetamine, Valium, and the like.  But, with those, here and there throughout the week, but in small doses.  I was also a daily weed smoker.

Since I began, things in life got better.  I was happier.  My business improved.  Great relationship.  Yadda yadda.

I woke up one day and decided I was done.  I still have over 100 roxies, bars, and everything else in my safe.  That was a month ago, and I haven't touched since.  I'm not sure if I will or not.  But, in my current time and space, I'm 100% sober, off weed and pills entirely.  I don't miss it.  I have no desires to use ever.  In fact, the thought really turns me off.

I immediately felt a lot of liquid beneath my mouth, and to my luck it was mostly saliva- not too much blood. I have a tendency to grind my teeth while I sleep, so this could have potentially been worse. My tongue is CURRENTLY REFORMING back into its original shape,  but for a while it looked like a piece of silly putty that had been malformed with a pair of scissors. The area of my tongue which received the most pressure from my teeth is extremely bruised, and had minor bleeding. My neck is stiff as a motherfucker, so I'm going to not learn my lesson, take some more oxy and go to sleep in my actually bed, so hopefully ameliorate some of this neck pain.

One of my friends was the only dude with a plug and I put in a a decent amount of research before I committed. I 

decided my dosage for first time would be 10mg’s and my girlfriend was gonna do 14mg as she has a higher tolerance to generally every drug regardless of its effect. We took it and felt amazing for a couple hours, I mean it was spectacular if everything has just stop and that was the only thing I ever felt I would be content. 

After 2-3 hours I couldn’t stand up from the nausea. I couldn’t even sit up, but I was determined to play video games and consequently I threw up a couple times. 

My girlfriend decided she wanted to increase the nod slightly as it wasn’t hitting her like it hit me because of her general tolerance so she took .5mg of a xannax and she had a great time.

 I realized the danger and the love for the feeling is one that I never wanted to be accustom to. I knew that if I became comfortable with it I would be addicted.

Over the course of 4 months we did it another 5 times or so. 3 times it was my friend’s plug, one time it was an OP80, I did the Coca Cola method and did 40mg of that. I noticed something strange, it didn’t feel the same as the other ones. I wasn’t as nauseous, it didn’t feel as good but it wasn’t making me sick. 

After mentioning it to my friend he talked to his plug who he was decent friends with and he said it was slightly cut with heroin. In my mind I knew that didn’t make sense, too expensive and too difficult. I needed a new plug and after a couple a days I found one. They were smaller than the other ones I got but after comparing online the other ones were significantly bigger than normal. I snorted a quarter of it, I felt nothing. I snorted another quarter and felt a slight high but basically nothing. 

I started talking to other people and found out they are fent pressed and because of that my tolerance to opiates are supremely higher than most beginner’s. 

My question is, is there anything I can do about this? It’s extremely frustrating but it could ultimately be for the better. I’m just upset as I can’t have that feeling again without going to a dangerous dose for a beginner. 

My gf and J  experienced a range of health concerns after every fake 30. Blood in pee, hangover the next day, hallucinations While high similar to MDMA Dreams, in and out of consciousness while high. Extreme nausea to the point we couldn’t stand 10 minutes into the high and couldn’t sit up with it having to throw up.

I've been scammed before, finessed out of my money. I just have really shit luck.

I have a friend, who I don't know *tooo* well, that recently tore his ACL and needed surgery. They gave him a ton of 10/325 oxy and he says he's been trying to cut down on it, but that he could easily get more if he wanted to.

I don't wanna come across as a dickhead and ask him if I can buy his oxy from him, since he still might need it for his pain. But I was thinking about offering him $100 to get a new bottle for me after he didn't need it anymore. 

I took 2mg Xanax XR a few hours ago, and then 800mg Tagamet just 45min ago to potentate 15ml of Tussionex (Extended release Hydrocodone, 10mg per 5ml). I really don't feel much now and that was the last of my opiates :(

I'm young and I suffer from chronic neck and back pain, and oxy really helps, along with making me feel a nice fuzzy high. I know I can just get some heroin but I don't want to make that jump, ever. I'm in college and I gotta do well here.

Now a few weeks to go before surgery I reminded them of what they told me. They claim I don't qualify, but don't worry because I'll be able to get to the clinic anyways so all is well in their book. WTF. The whole point was so I wouldn't have to come to the clinic and could rest after surgery for a little bit.

The other Complete bullshit thing is that they said after 90 days of clean drug testing they will give me 1 day a week of take home medication. Well its been 90 days. So I should get my 1 day a week right? NOPE! I haven't gotten 6 urine tests. I've only had 4. Which btw is COMPLETELY FUCKING RANDOM AND OUT OF MY CONTROL.

When I banged this dope I would get crazy pain in my chest and all out of breath and sweating hard. It subsides after 30 seconds but at the time I felt like I shot up rando shit that was killing me.

I bitched at the dealer but of course the dude insists it's raw as fuck. He agrees to switch it out for some dope that was better than good. Another dealer (who I'm on hella good terms with)that definitely has a similar source called it devil dope and that he refuses to get the real stepped on shit. So I asked him if his supply does have purposefully bad shit or different kinds of dope or if they just have one version of dope they sell. He got weirded out and told me to never ask about his suppliers ever.

Well a few months go by and I holla at the first dealer. End up getting the devil dope. It is some kind of opiates cause you will feel well. Get it switched out but he tells me ""my bad I mixed up by bags.""

Tan on the left, Grey in the middle, tar on the right. One piece of tar looks kind of lighter because it had just been ripped off the huge ball of tar he had. Wish I could have just snatched that shit and ran but I would have gotten killed lmao. One time he opened a whole jar fully of Oxys in front of my face and said ""damn I bet you wish you could have all these."" lmao fuck you

I'm sort of new to dope. Not sure which kinds are best for what and such.

My usual guy (as mentioned above) had the tar and tan until recently sold me some grey shit calling it ""china."" I thought it was but it ran on the foil and smoking did have some effect. but so did snorting. idk. Can someone help me figure out if this is #3 or #4 or what? It's really nice regardless. Probably his best product no matter how you use it. I don't think I've ever seen ""china"" or ECP in real life, so I can't speak on it. (Posting pics of all 3 types shortly!)

The tar is bomb, I like smoking it. but its easy to go through quickly. It's sort of brittle so usually ill do a few lines of It too.
The tan is okay, obviously #3 or freebase or whatever the term is. It's sort of looks like very light brown sugar. Can be snorted for longer but less intense effect than smoking.

I'm about to cop. what would you cop?

Edit: From the midwest if that helps. 
I copped the grey and tar but wanna know what you guys think because he's my go-to guy.
Also how do I go about anonymously posting a pic of it? I'd love to show it off.

I would also really like to know If this grey dope is actual #4 even though it runs on the foil.
I haven't seen many posts about grey #3/free base (are they the same thing?). It's usually tan. If the grey is #3, what are the BA's of intranasal vs inhaled? Can I use an Emergen-C packet with citric acid/vitamin C to turn it into #4? If so, can I just mix them together and snort them, or do I have to do It in water then snort the water? Could I make a nasal spray? Is there a way to isolate the citric acid and/or vitamin c?

Lastly, since the tar is brittle and easy to crush down and snort, does that make it lower quality? I usually smoke like 3/4 and snort the other quarter. Should I switch that around, skip snorting it, or skip smoking it? I assumed the intranasal bioavailability is stronger.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST. Can someone PLEASE explain the numbering system. I get #1 is a form of morphine precursor to heroin. I'm not sure what #2 is and if it is different than #3? Is BTH even on the list? Or is the system its so old it doesn't apply anymore?

###Earlier today...


As I'm sitting in my kitchen drinking a cup of coffee I get a text from Cliff.

  Cliff: Yo what's up?


  Cliff: Its emergency when r u off work?


  Me: ""What's the emergency? (to hell with telling him I'm home and off from work)


  Cliff: Nevermind, I'm just rying to flip my xanax.


  Me: Is that the emergency? Did you need me to deliver to a potential client?** (the part about delivering the xanax to his client is actually just me probing for more info)


  Cliff: Workin on it


&nbsp;

Two days ago Cliff said that he was trading his xanax for dope and I said, ""so that could take a day or two.."" He responded, ""no it should be tonight.""


He doesn't presently owe me any dope but there is an odd $20 on my balance sheet that he still owes me from the recent past. When he says that he's *working on it*, it is implied that he is going to share the dope that he obtains upon conducting the trade.


On more desperate days when I'm not sitting on subs, I'd be checking in every few hours, ""did you trade yet?"" It has been two days since he said it ""should be tonight."" 

I still can't say enough how happy I am that I'm not in need or counting on anything he says.


&nbsp;


###Later during dinner he texted...


  Cliff: Yo u at work? **Its important** man


  Me: I'm looking to eat dinner when I get home after 8. What's the emergency?  (It's a lie, I'm already eatiner dinner but I'd prefer him to think I'm not home just in case...)


  Cliff: Could you grab me a couple of 2 liter sodas that are 2 for $3? I'll compensate ya for it


  Cliff: **If I drink water again I'll die**


  Cliff: **Figured you could use a bump**


&nbsp;


Umm yeah, no. I told him I can't do it. What I love is that he's looking to compensate me with a bump. Is that a bump from a single pill? Perhaps he'll crush up two roxy 15mg's, snort some of it and let me get the remaining table scraps?


I'm tempted to ask what the definition of ""bump"" is in this context but I don't want to make him think that I'm remotely willing or able to buy his shitty soda. 

Anyway, his response to my not being able to get soda was ""Damn it"", so no hope of dope.. good thing I don't really care.

&nbsp;


###Recap: 


Cliff picked up his own damn Xanax on Monday because I made damn sure not to do the pick-up. In the past he'd ask me to bike to the pharmacy for him. If he didn't have any roxies to give me which he usually doesn't by that time of the month he'd entice me with a dream.


One time he texted, ""would you do it if there was a chance that you'd have something to do before work?""


Subsequent times I knew there was no chance that the benzos would get traded for dope before work but still held out hope that it would be handled by the end of my shift.


&nbsp;

He might've successfully traded benzos for a sharable amount of dope on one out of six times in the past few months. Each time I picked up the benzos I'd deliver them then wait and spend the day checking for status updates while Cliff would ultimately get barred out and nothing would transpire.


I found it frustrating because I would wonder to myself, ""how is this dude going to answer the phone for a prospective buyer if he's so barred out?""


&nbsp;


Well, this week has been great for me. I have enough subs to get me through pay day and beyond. By that point in time I will either see a doctor or get a bulk street discount through my own new connect. 


Either way, I am not buying dope next pay day. I am not buying dope and I am certainly not sharing or loaning any to Cliff. 


At some point when I see him or when he calls my phone he's going to ask what I'm looking to buy next week. Something like, ""How many buns on pay day?"" At that point in time I will have to disappoint him.


Perhaps he'll act like he understands and supports my decision but he'll more than likely try to talk me out of it. 


&nbsp;


My next posts will include:


* How Cliff reacts when I tell him that I am not buying dope on pay day next week.


* Dreams, motivations and aspirations. (Think Forrest Gump running across the country but with a bicycle)

7uejz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7uejz3/suboxone_to_methadone_switch/,2,https://redd.it/7uejz3,Sufferingsilently250,Suboxone to methadone switch,"Summary of what got me where I am today.

I had a nasty back injury about two years ago. Long story short after trying a variety of painkillers my dr settled on morphine. I had a natural high tolerance and it took 80mg in the beginning to dull the pain enough to function.
By 6 months later I had stabilizes at around 200mg twice a day.

Keep in mind this was enough to dull the pain but not to do much mentally.

My ex learned of the doseage level I was on and, came to the determination that it was not acceptable even though prescribed by a very solid smart dr. And decided she was going to cause me a great deal of grief as far as my parenting time with my son went unless I stopped taking it.

So I saw another local dr who specializes in opiate treatment, as I wasn't too keen to suffer through withdrawal.

He suggested Suboxone, and it took 16mg to get me comfortable after 2 days of withdrawal.

I was trying to get off of it as soon as possible and 8 weeks later was down to 2mg per day, but my back pain was so terrible that I had to go back to 16mg to even make a bit of difference.

So that's gone up to 24mg over the past 2 years.

It hardly helps my back pain, has given me terrible headaches, I feel like I'm never well rested and wake 2-3 times per night and have a variety of other very undesirable side effects.

So I've spoken with the dr and asked about alternatives as I'm stuck with this injury for life.

What he basically said was fentanyl or hydromorphone would be the two options but he was concerned about tolerance and such.

Then he was recommended methadone.
My first reaction was as you'd guess, being as all I knew of it was the taboo and stereotypical view of it.

However after doing a fair amount of reading it sounds like it can be pretty great for severe long term pain. And I wouldn't have to go to a clinic or anything.
From what I read it's one of the best for long term serious pain.

Anyway as I consider my options I'd like to know what the transition from Suboxone to methadone would be like? Do you end up with any bad effects from stopping the Suboxone as I've heard horror stories?

How is methadone for side effects? As I've had a hell of a time with Suboxones side effects.

What doesage of methadone would a person have to take to switch from 24mg of Suboxone and to still help with pain?

Are there any side effects as far as energy, libido etc vs Suboxone?

I'd appreciate any firsthand knowledge and info possible.

Thanks folks",1517443512.0

**1-20// More of the Same**

&nbsp;


Got high again today but I don’t feel too guilty. Smooth knocked on the motel room door at 9am to collect the money I owed him. I didn’t get much sleep due to what I can only assume was a prostitute in the room next to mine. From 3:30am until past 6am she would scream and moan loudly in the way only prostitutes and porn stars do.


I fronted a $20 off Smooth at 9am and managed to fall asleep by 11am. At 3pm I woke up and departed to collect my check and pay Smooth back.

———-

At this point I stop writing due to how rough I feel and continue to tell the story the next day. I’ve taken Kratom and I’m smoking tons of weed with a house full of people in bay city for a smoke off. I feel good and want to write so I continue the story where I left off

———-

It was the first nice day in awhile in Michigan. Most of the snow has melted and this decaying area seems to be absolutely glowing. I’m not high but I’m not sick either and it’s the closest I can feel to normal lately so I can actually appreciate the view. The beauty is almost too much to take in after the dull motel room and I have to put my head down briefly.


I know what Elliot Smith means when he said “gonna walk, walk, walk, 4 more blocks plus the one in my brain”. The walk is 20 minutes but feels like 30. I run into Smooth and he tells me he took a hit of acid. In my experience whenever black people take acid it’s really funny and this rule once again proves true. I pick up my money without incident and pay back what I owe plus buy a fat $60 of some truly garbage dope. It’s pretty much a white trash dope fiend shit show after this so if you’re reading this expecting the diary of Anne frank you picked the wrong read.


I do the true dopefiend move of using a public bathroom to shoot up. Of public bathrooms places like McDonald’s are the least junky-ish in my opinion. I go to a cafe that has a bathroom key you have to ask for because people come here to shoot up. I buy a $1.75 San Pellegrino and not just because it’s what Patrick Bateman drank in America Psycho. It was the only water available.


The key is attached to a big tin mug and I feel stupid to be on such an obvious dope chase in front of all these nice college students. I try to make small talk with the cashier by complimenting his tattoos. For some reason I bring up prison and how the prison tattoo guy spelled my mom’s wrong and it is very awkward and cringe worthy. Sarah said I was high functioning autistic once and even though she said it was just meant to be an insult I always suspected she may have been serious. Maybe she has a point, but at the time none of this mattered. I had picked up a wet dirty cigarette butt from the parking lot because this reality is better than the nightmare of cooking up a shot and not being able to draw it up.


I put half of the dope in my cooker. It’s super light tan rocks that dissolves very quickly in water. I draw up using my disgusting cotton, register, and slam quickly. Despite being a large shot the effect isn’t much more than a slightly improved mood with that very little rush.


It did have enough of an effect to make me decide to go over to Brian’s trap house of an apartment. He had ripped me off a few weeks earlier but he has the best plug, Polo, and I consider asking him to cop for free to make up for what he owes me.


I foolishly buy another $20 of shitty dope from Smooth before entering Brian’s. Brian isn’t even there and it’s just Katy and two younger black crack dealers who I didn’t think I knew but one remembers me. He says he saw me overdose at the trap before and thought I was going to die. This is not the first time I’ve heard things like this. I genuinely like Katy and kind of missed her. She’s gone from snorting to shooting heroin but her main addiction is crack. She asks me to buy a hit for us and since I’m using her house to get high this is etiquette. I call over one of the dealers and ask to buy a dime rock. He makes a minor show of acting like he’s doing me some huge favor because “I usually sell $20s, dog”.


I break the rock in half and prepare another shot of the shitty dope. I load the pipe with my rock and smoke it completely and manage to shoot my weak dope before exhaling a cloud of crack smoke that’s still so big after holding it in I know it’s going to be a strong one. The hit of crack was generous but nonetheless only $5 worth but it’s potent so I get a minor bell ringer. The cocaine is outperforming the heroin by a long shot and I don’t really feel much of anything from the heroin.


Brian returns and makes an apology and agrees right away to buy me 2 packs for $30. 2 packs would normally be $40 and I’d have to break him off one effectively making one pack $20. One pack is guaranteed to get me anywhere between “plenty high” to overdosed. I putz around running to the store to buy single cigarettes and drinks. The dopeman Brian goes through, Polo, has drivers that deliver for him which is usually an indication of good quality product. He says 15 minutes and usually takes 30 but today he’s true to his word. So is Brian and he delivers me 2 untampered $20s of very potent dope. Even though we are both strung out I first feel respect for him making it halfway right. Then I see regret for ripping me off flash over his face in a genuine and unpretentious way. I am able to forgive him and go to get high on some good dope for the first time in a while.


Things blur and the night ends.

&nbsp;



**1 - 21// Return to Bay City**

&nbsp;



Today is Sunday so I’m going back up north to Bay City to see Sarah. She’s staying at the house of a guy she cheated on me with when I was locked up. The fact I put up with this says something about how much I love her, or maybe how pathetic I am. I pick her up and she is in a surprisingly good mood and lunch goes fine. I have purchased 3 bottles of Kratom to hold me over and they are doing their job but do not take the edge completely off.


Sarah wants to go to a “smoke off” so we call a ride from our friends Allen and Marcus. Sarah, Alex (Sarah’s nephew), Allen, Allen’s girlfriend, Marcus and I all pack into a tiny hoopty car that looks like it can barely drive. Due to all the weight the wheels are constantly scraping and I’m terrified of getting pulled over as I have warrants. We must have looked ridiculous, 2 people in the front and 4 people crammed in the back. Not to mention Sarah, who is a rather large girl, is sitting on my lap and has to lean her head down due to the car roof.

We swing by the house of an old Vietnam Vet who grows medical marijuana and I buy $40 worth of weed. I also buy Sarah some alcohol to improve her mood and make her tolerable to be around. We go to the house of an older, white, gang banger. If there’s one thing more pathetic and cringe worthy than a white gang banger its a white gang banger over the age of 30. Bay City is kind of a white ghetto and a lot of people here are white trash. Allen, his girlfriend, and Marcus are good people though.


More and more people arrive and it turns out I’m the only person with weed. I feel like Sarah used me since it’s always my money spent on weed. It hurts me that she cares so little about the money I have to work so hard for (I make $8 an hour) but I’m sure the thought never crossed her mind. There’s a guy there Sarah fucked when we were broken up, he’s older, drunk off his ass and has a crack pipe in his pocket. If this is one of the guys she sleeps with what does that say about me? I try to block it out of my mind. The conversation is local gossip and vapid bullshit so I decide to read my book. When there’s a group of people around I can’t get a word in with Sarah because she makes herself the center of attention. If I try to tell a story or comment on the topic she raises her voice or cuts me off, to be fair this rude habit of hers applies to everyone though. This used to upset me to no end but I’ve grown used to it. Seeing how little she values my opinion or conversation does hurt though. In my head I call this the “Sarah show” because of her tendency to hog the conversation and stand up during the long diatribes, usually about other times she got drunk or just plain old shit talking a person who is not there to defend themselves.


Sarah wants to smoke crack and tries to get some from a wigger for free. I text her angrily and tell her if she smokes it I’m leaving. Even though I haven’t remained sober I am trying and if she smokes crack it means I will too. I would never bring drugs around her when she’s trying to stay clean but I’ve never expected this same respect from her, nor have I ever got it.



The chance to score some benzos arises so her nephew and I quickly depart to buy 30 Valium. Although she expects me to give her 15 of these for free she does not want to walk the 10 minute trip to grab them with us. I buy 20 of them and offer Sarah 7. She is not happy with this even though 7 Valium is a large dose and she didn’t pay for any of it. She throws a minor hissy fit and insists she won’t feel it at all… even though she ends up being belligerent due to the mix of benzos and alcohol. The Valium takes all of my concerns and self esteem issues away and I feel human again. All I want to do is be quiet and spend time in my own world where the cares and stresses have melted away.




Time ceases to exist and my memory and consciousness only come in flashes. I’ve taken 30mg of Valium and now I want to write again. I’m with Sarah and it’s going surprisingly well and my prospects of sex look pretty good. Getting and maintaining an erection will be hard and I will not likely be orgasming. At this point I take more Valium and I am near blacking out. I awoke to these notes on my phone


On 70mg of Valium sobbing gotta write notes before I forget. Sarah found journals and is done with me.

**Days Later**

&nbsp;


Sarah broke up and is now threatening legal action. I don’t know where to start. I guess it would be best to begin where I left off, but I took a lot of Valium and my memory is fuzzy of the period that follows. I met someone from Reddit. An Asian girl living in Japan (but formerly lived in America), it feels stupid to talk about this on something that people might read… but it’s a special relationship and I am hesitant to discuss it further.


**Update** *The girl and I have been talking non stop as of the current date (1/31/18). She’s amazing and means a lot to me already. I’m glad that reddit could introduce me to so many supportive people.*


Sarah went through my phone when I passed out from the Valium and read my private journals I had never published. She freaks out that I have written about her, even though nothing negative had been written and it was mostly all about how much I loved her and how much unreciprocated love hurts. She is yelling at me and telling me to call my Grandma to come pick me up even though it’s 3am. She threatens to hit me if I don’t give her 3 more Valium. I hold my ground and not just because I want the Valium for myself. I can tell that this is the real, permanent break up but for once it doesn’t break my heart. The girl I’ve been talking to has made me feel like I’m worth being loved for the first time in years. Despite the insults being thrown at me I fall asleep smiling but deep down I know the Valium is partially the cause. I have taken 10 10mg Valiums at this point which is a big dose for me.

&nbsp;



**1 - 22// Grandparents**

&nbsp;



The next day I wake up still in a haze and have my family pick me up. Since Sarah has read my journals she saw I had relapsed and told my family. They tell me they’re not taking me back to Ypsilanti and I don’t know what to do with myself. Home is death for me, the last time I was at home I overdosed twice in three days. I have a life, a job, and true friends in Ypsilanti. Thankfully I am able to convince my family to let me return and I only miss one day of work. I return to the crack motel on Tuesday January 23..


I have a good amount of money and make the poor decision to get high before heading to college. I am registering for late classes and need to take placement tests. I buy a few $20 folds of heroin through Brian and it is amazing dope. I ride the bus to school and manage to find my way to the testing center in my heroin daze. I can’t tell if the placement test is really easy or if I’m just dumb and it’s all going over my head. It turns out I get a perfect score and qualify for everything. For the first time in a long time I am proud of myself.


Like a true dopefiend I manage to parlay this success into a failure. Instead of returning directly to work I head back to Brian and Katy’s to get more dope. The dope and crack takes hold and I become “stuck”. Being stuck is when you start getting high somewhere and don’t leave until all the money and drugs are gone. I keep telling myself “I’m only an hour late, I can make an excuse that the test ran late”. One hour turns into two and eventually it’s 3am and I’ve missed my shift completely. Brian and Katy begin arguing over missing packs of dope and it looks like it’s going to get physical. Plates get smashed and I decide to leave before the cops show up. I find out later the cops did show up but they didn’t answer the door. The walk back to the motel is cold and lonely but the opiates filter this experience into a pleasant one.

&nbsp;



**Wednesday 1 - 24// Addict Excuses and 3rd Chances**


&nbsp;


I know I am in trouble at work and I’m afraid to go in. I message the group chat with a bullshit excuse. I tell them the night before I left my phone at college then got on the wrong bus and had to walk 10 miles home and that’s why I missed work. I really doubt my co workers and managers believe this but they don’t call me out. I feel an incredible sense of guilt over lying to these people who have been so good to me, given me so many chances and shown me more love than people have in years. I want to change so bad and there’s nothing I desire more than to make these people proud. They took a chance hiring a drug addict felon and I’m letting them down. I won’t give up though, I will beat this disease. Despite everything they allow me to work but tell me one more no call/no show and I will lose my job. I resolve not to let them down like I do so many others.


I did not plan on sharing my journals with people I know in real life, but Sarah posts them on facebook to show everyone I have relapsed.
 I manage to stay off the heroin and only take Kratom. I don’t feel too bad surprisingly.

Secondly, this post is about Aunt Flow so boys probably want to stop reading now. 

I have been using for 4 years, and have kept a regular cycle except for months that I was stressed out. I didn't even know until reading on here that usage effects such issues. I snort, so I'm basically curious if the stopping of mother nature has to do with usage methods. Like if someone snorting has different effects than someone shooting? 

I've had times I was using a gram a day and still had my monthly visitor, so I'm doubtful that matters. 

I also know addicts get pregnant all the time so obviously they had to have been getting their cycle too, right? 

Probably sound stupid asking all this but this is one of the many things I've been pondering lately along with if its possible to mentally control withdrawals, using myself as a test subject so its probably a biased view. Curiosity kills this cat. 

Which reminds me since I'm known for my kitties on here, they are all doing extremely well. Not so much kittens anymore since its suspected one is about to make me a granmammy any day now.

I live about 3 minutes away from my local fire department so they were there quick.

I think I just turned all the coke into crack!""","I still don't know what's up dudes impressively unpredictable ways of operation or the cello, but I'll get to that. I wanna tell you guys about this dude I've been runnin around with, I think he might be one of my favorite people to ever be squeezed out of a womb. We'll call him Bud. Bud is a big black dude with dreads, covered in tattoos and piercings with a pistol in his waistband and a Rasta handle buckknife on his side. He also has an enormous heart, I'd say the biggest heart I've ever found out here. Outside appearance may be intimidating, but as soon as he starts talking and his mannerisms come out he's just a teddy bear, the least scary guy in the room, you can't help but love him. He's a big drug dealer and sets an example with how kind, considerate and thoughtful he is of others. In regards to just brain processing he's kinda slow sometimes which can be hard to work with, but I wouldn't want him to change one bit. 

A few nights ago I was hangin at his place. He fell off his game super hard recently from one bad move that has his phone service off until paid for, he's stuck bouncing around people's hotspots so I've been helping him make some money. He was in the kitchen behind me preparing what I assumed was food. He recently traded all of his heroin for cocaine, I don't agree with that move but that's what we had to work with. He was doing fuck all in the kitchen and I sat on the couch chainsmoking cigarettes while using my phone to get him coke sales, occasionally setting it down to ramble to him about my stupid shit and stare at a TV in front of me with no chords or receiver. After a couple hours I completely forget about the prospect of prepared food and have some decent sales lined up when he shouts from the kitchen, ""OH NO! I think I just turned all the coke into crack!"" Are you fucking serious? He urgently asks me to please go get my little bags because now we have to bag crack rock, not cocaine. I go upstairs to get my bags, return downstairs and what do ya know, a bunch of crack has replaced the cocaine, sitting in a frying pan looking like a bunch of money about to go away. He claims he didn't think he would be able to do it right and what wasn't processed into crack would remain as cocaine, not be ruined. First of all Bud, it doesn't work that way but it looks like you did it right so good job I guess. 

The crack was sold off faster than I expected. So last night I'm with him in his room and we're dipping candy bars in a jar of peanut butter while planning out and setting up the moves we're gonna pull for the night. It looked like things couldn't get moving for an hour or so, I take this time to smash down the road to sell a couple legal items I had and take someone to a plug nearby and get him taken care of. I was gone maybe 40 minutes. 

Like 40 minutes absolute maximum. Probably closer to 30. That's it, that's all the time I was gone. A lunchbreak. 

And when I get back and walk upstairs into his room, he's sitting in there and there's just a big ass cello taking up the entire front wall. A god damn cello. He hasn't looked up at me from his phone or said a word, just typing. I look at the cello, then at him, then back to the cello, then him. 

""Um... is that a cello?""

He doesn't look up. ""Huh?"" 

""Is that... is that a cello?"" 

He looks up at me and then to the cello and smiles at it. ""Yeahhh, it is."" 

""Where the fuck did it come from?""

""Huh? Oh I don't really know."" Back to his phone. There's a 5 second pause.

""No. Bud, no. This does not just happen. Something occurred and it came from somewhere. Seriously where the fuck did it come from?"" 

He looks me dead in the eye, ""Bro, I really don't know. It wasn't here, and then it was. My theory is it's a gift from God so I can sell it and turn my phone service back on. Do you know anyone who would want a cello?""

""I... You know what I might actually. Let me ask around.""

I have someone interested in the cello, I'm bringing them to check it out tonight. While driving home last night I was just thinking about how weird this is and wanted to tell you guys. If you can't stay safe out there please stay smart, love ya.",1517597697.0

Now I use occasionally whenever I come home. Im from p****, but I tour all over the country as a tech for bands now which keeps me away from the shit. I dont NEED H, but I like to do it. Ill never do it more then two days in a row, and I'll keep myself from experiencing bad WD's (i believe that was my source of full-blown addiction).

Well anyway, I came home from a long run a few weeks ago. As usual I'm paid up and i wanna take a trip to the block. I usually run up and cop 6-10 bags and a few vials of crack (I enjoy that shit too). This block I've been going to has been consistent for YEARS. like, NOT fetty. Usually some up-to-par shit. I know myself very well, and know my limits. I used to shoot, but I cut that shit out and only snort it anymore. So anyway, I copped and took the subway back down to 30th st. I went in the bathroom there as usual and took a look at the bag i was about to do, i knew immediately that it was straight fent, you can just tell by the way it moves in the bag and the way it looks. So at this point i'm pretty dissapointed.

I do a half bag as usual, and the shits pretty fucking strong. Ive bought fetty before (on purpose) and this shit was way strong. (Ive had a high tolerance for years, even in periods of non-use i can snort or bang 1 bag of some fire dope and be chillin). I Decided to walk around for an hour or so because my train to w******** was cancelled.  finally get on the train and get to w********. My bus to ****** isnt for another hour and by now the legless fet I did had worn off. I went into the bathroom of the train station in wilmington. Did the other half of my bag. Next thing i know im awoken by EMS/12 in the bathroom.

I fucking OD'd on this dumb ass shit. by SNORTING it. the last time(s) i OD'd was over 5 years ago in my ""glory days"" but that was from shooting D. Of course Narcan/ETC/hospital followed. But im so fucking mad at this shit. Lucklily the cops were cool and didn't smack me with any charges.

P*** needs to step the fucking game up. All i want is some nice H, not this synthetic bullshit. FUCK fentanyl.

Lately she's been coming up with excuses to ask him for more coke than he already gives her. Here are some reasons she's asked him for more ""medicine""(coke).
1. She needs to write a important letter. 
2. Her back hurts.(claims she's had spine cancer her whole life bc she rode on a top secret CIA submarine)
3. She wants to go to sleep but can't without a line of coke. 
4. She has a headache. 
5. She needs to make an important phone call. 
6. She knows she needs to eat but can't without a line.
She of course never does what she claims she needs the coke to do. 

She's still crushing up and snorting tums and aspirin saying she ""metaphysically turned it into coke and heroin with her special brain because she used to be a pharmacist"". She's also still giving out to her husbands customers and telling them it's drugs. A friend of mine shot some of her mixture. He was pissed. 

A couple of nights ago my roommate, her husband, got into some Xanax with his usual heroin and passed the hell out hard. After an hour or so she started fiending for more ""medicine"". Since he can't be woke up she flat out tells me she's going to try to get his drugs out of his pockets. I'd caught her opening his bag of coke while he was passed out on the couch and left it in his jacket a few days earlier and woke him up by jumping up and asking what she was doing. She swore up and down she wasn't going to take any and was just getting it out to hand to him but this time she'd have to get his bag out of his pockets. She said she would tell him when he woke up exactly how much she took and he'd be ok with it (yea right). She said she would give me some and not tell him she gave me any when she told him but I said I wanted no part of it and advised against it. Well she tried anyway. It was sad seeing someone dig through their passed out husbands pockets to steal their drugs. I slick recorded her bc I figured she would try to blame me when he woke up to find his drugs gone since I'm the new person in the house. She's tried before. Luckily he hid the drugs elsewhere so she spent hours ransacking the house looking for his stash but last night she managed to steal his boy. She was unconscious most of the day and was out so hard you could shake her and get no response. Since she woke up she has been completely psychotic and denying stealing his shit and rambling like someone in a institution for the criminally insane while pacing up and down the hallway. 

She has been walking all around the house talking to herself loudly and angrily. She tried to convince everyone the county sent her a letter saying they were giving her $5,000,000 for harassing her by putting her in jail. At one point she was saying she had the check in her pocket. Then she said she had a letter in her pocket saying they were giving her the money and all she needed to get it was an ID. Come to find out what she had is a post card informing her of a class action lawsuit lol. She said ""it says plaintiff and defendant so it's a criminal case. I'm going to ask for more money."" We had to explain what a class action lawsuit is to her even though she claims to have passed the bar. 

Oh yea she's lately been claiming to have passed the bar ""with a 100"" just for fun. Also said she passed the MCAT with a ""perfect score of 100"" rofl. Still waiting to tell her a perfect score is 528 I think but she's just say that's what she got. Its infuriating. I am tired of her lies so I asked her what habeas corpus is and she said without missing a beat that it meant to have something expunged lol. I then asked her about plessy v ferguson and she said ""I don't know what every single case ever was about"". Hahaha. I tried telling her this is very very basic stuff everyone even remotely interested in law would know about but she wouldn't back down with her bullshit. 

She also claims her stepdad is secretly the head of the department of defense and is ""in charge of the whole military"" and the hq for the department of defense is located under the very worst ghetto in our city. Her stepdad is really a teacher but that's just his cover. Lol. When she went to jail and was released she claims it wasn't bc she went to court and took a plea it was bc he sent high up members of the Air Force and navy to demand her release. 

She's been trying to set me up with her daughter for a long time now but her daughter is gross, mean and has incurable stds. Since I'm not interested in that daughter she started telling me about her other daughter. She says she's really hot and nice etc and we'd make a great couple. Then I find out the daughter in question is 16 and I'm 32. Wtf. What kind of mother tries to hook her 16 year old up with a 32 year old?

She claims she has ""a perfect IQ"" (she said today AT&T studied her brain for 3 months bc of her perfect IQ lmao)and went to ""a prodigy school for special brain people and retarded kids"". She also says she used to be a computer programmer so I asked her to name an operating system. She couldn't.  She said she took c+, c++ and c+++ rofl. We've been arguing over c+++ for days. Over the week since I've asked her to name an operating system she's given me many crazy excuses why she didn't know what the are. 

She's been mad at me today bc I told her I don't believe her wild claims. I told her if I said I spoke French but couldn't say a single thing in French I wouldn't be surprised if people didn't believe I spoke French. She still sticks to the bs though. 

She claims to be a Dr, a lawyer, a pharmacist, a computer programmer, a former stripper (this I believe) and a painter. I'm sure there are some I forget. I told her I used to be an astronaut and got a 100 on my astronaut exam lol. I might just start one upping any claim she makes. If she has a perfect IQ then I have have a perfect IQ +5 bc I got the bonus questions then they hooked my brain up to a special computer to analyze my massive smarts but I was so smart it broke the computer type shit lol. 

Well that's some of the wildness my insane compulsive lying roommate said lately. She wants pity for her lifelong cancer, envy for all of the millions of dollars she claims she has and awe of her extreme intelligence. She doesn't understand that these days she can't just bs her way through claiming she's a lawyer and shit though. Google is her undoing. ",1517591602.0

Didn’t touch anything for almost six years until I got hold of some codeine for a headache. I felt that exact same rush but nowhere near as intense. Within a short period of time I became addicted to over the counter codeine meds. I tried to kick it two years ago but the temptation was too great, especially since it was readily available at any pharmacy. I ended up moving halfway across the world to a country that has now banned over the counter codeine meds. I knew that this was an opportunity to finally get clean. I was using well over 600 mg of codeine a day. It’s been 24 hours and I’m feeling ok. I’ve popped 300 mg of Lyrica, some diazepam and temazepam. I’m feeling pretty relaxed but my thoughts are all over the place. The only withdrawal symptom I have so far is the chills. 

Has anyone else used Lyrica? Any tips on anything else that may help? I know that the second day is usually absolute hell.

Then I'm asking if I'm a jealous bitch or if I'm right and want to know what you guys think about the whole thing. (And I do not intend to make this into a competition of who's the most fucked up junkie! I'm more about respecting the achievement of being a functional addict. Some things are just harder to overcome than others.) 




DISCLAIMER: I KNOW THAT EVEN GUMMI BEARS CAN BE THE FOCUS OF AN ADDICTION. I'M AWARE THAT ADDICTION IS A MORE COMPLEX AND NUANCED ISSUE THAN JUST OPIATE ADDICTION! I DON'T MEAN TO BELITTLE ANYONE'S EXPERIENCE! I'M NOT DRIVING AT A JUNKIER THAN THOU THING! SO PLEASE DON'T MAKE IT INTO ONE.




It pisses me off so bad when my roommate tries to make the case for his 'cannabis dependency'. It's infuriating! He said he's experiencing withdrawal from weed. I've stopped smoking often enough to know that sleep troubles are common, but they're done after 2 - 3 days. But dude, that's nothing compared to opiate withdrawal. I'd really like to slap him when he starts whining how hard it is to quit smoking. 




Like, a slap with the back of my hand, striking straight through the face, like *'wake up you idiot, you're okay! Be grateful for everything you have and go do your shit! You're part of a perfect couple, soon you'll be a doctor! Just don't fuck it up bc of your unhealthy fascination with drugs!'*





 I hate it when people have everything handed to them and still they're trying to make problems where there aren't any. I've met a couple of this sort and it makes me sick every time. They have options, they have resources, they have thousands paths laid out for them, they have suppor - WHY would anyone pretend to be underprivileged? Where's the kick in romanticizing mental health issues and addiction? Why not use in a more positive mindset?




What's really getting me angry is that he's my friend. He knows me and he knows how I struggle. He studies medicine, so he knows how fucked up it is to organize your life around a raging addiction to heroin and Cocaine! I mean, I'm dragging my ass out of bed and to work/uni every day with real wd symptoms when waking up. I don't have a rich, functional family or a romantic relationship that looks like it's out of a romantic novel. And yes, I am jelly and rambling, but... It just really pushes my buttons just to think of it. it feels like his overstating of his struggle with weed belittles what I achieve daily. I don't know. I never said those things to him, but am I wrong? This isn't healthy, right? Or am I just a condescending bitch on a junkier-than-thou trip, without noticing it? It's just, I feel like screaming 'be happy! If I had what you have, I'd be so happy!' tho I wouldn't be. I'd be depressed, then feel guilty for not being happy which turns into planning my suicide since I know I can't enjoy life the way I want to. But he's not depressed! I don't get where this fascination with hardship and misery comes from. Another friend of mine, with a verrrry wealthy background, was even worse. He always provoked having bad trips, psychoses and stuff. And when he had his first drug induced psychosis, he wouldn't stop talking about it. It became the central part of his identity for more than a year. Even when talking to complete strangers at a party whom we've just met - topic no1 is the psychosis. Like, dude, why would you want to identify yourself with disease!? I hate talking about my addiction or depression or migraines. I feel so helpless and angry when realizing how I can't do anything against my body being at war with me. I just want to be normal and functional! You have it all and you just shit on it? It's infuriating!

When I can pay 15 a point, break it down in several small lines, and get ganked out my mind for really just 15 bucks a night if I space it out?? Pills just seem so wasteful compared to dope. I mean I know there's people that only use pills and ""won't stoop to the level of using heroin"" but you're doing synthetic opis made in a pharma lab somewhere so there isn't much difference imo. 

You elites can keep your 10 mg hydros or oxy/roxys. I'll just keep bumping the ECP up my nostrils. Only pills I buy now are Xanax and that's because they're dirt cheap even on the street and to me a little Benzo can compliment a good dope buzz. To each their own I guess. 

Edit: I was wrong to call pill poppers ""elites"". I wasn't thinking clearly earlier and I apologize for offending anyone if they were. I just wish h users were treated equally to pill users.

ALSO : I'm a chainsmoker and like to smoke the occasional cigarette after getting real high.

I switched to dope 4 months ago, and did up to about 40 bags a day. Snorting only.

I’ve been clean for 16 days. The withdrawal is STILL mind boggling terrible. I get 10 oxy 30’s in a few hours today.

What dose do I do? I used to swallow 5 and wait for the high. Then go up to 30. Obviously I’m scared i might overdose. I also don’t want to waste this high by only using 2.

Is it ok if I sniff 2 and pop 2? 120 mg? Keep in mind 3 weeks ago I could take 300-400 mg like a champ.

Didn't want to disclose being an addict, but had to. They tried to get a blood sample and it crushed the nurses ego when they couldn't draw a drop from my shitty veins. 





God, I didn't want to tell the doc I was a user, but I gotta tell him I'm downing 1000mg of morphine daily as maintenance. I mean, they will put me under propofol. I admit, I'm looking forward to trying this, but I'm more torn between 'this is unnecessary' and 'if I have symptoms I should get it checked'.




I told the doc and wish I didn't. He was very weird about it, avoided eye contact and his attitude was all like 'why would you care for your health if you're shooting heroin into your veins?' good point, but still - not his job to point out. He didn't say anything and I bet this is 110% my own paranoia and my own uncomfy-Ness with being a junkie.





The real fun started when they wanted a blood sample. The nurse was crushed when she didn't hit at the 5th try. When the other doctor came in I luckily remembered I did a blood screening at my maintenance docs and offered to have the results sent over. Close call. I mean, if he would've looked any closer at my right arm, it would be clear as day *why* my veins are that bad.




This stressed me out majorly. Did any of you experience similar stuff? I hate going to other doctors than my maintenance doc (tho I don't like him either) and disclosing my addiction. Just this look people give you. Like  'oh so you're just pretending to be normal!'.

I did a nice LITTLE shot of ice about 5 minutes ago when I got home.
When I do ice I can only do MAYBE .025-.05 or else I just feel tweaked, and I’m not a big fan of how long it lasts.  Just enough to make me feel good after this hell I’ve endured (:

Also I wanna say I don't wanna die I would never do this without being EXTREMELY careful and with my vitals supervised the entire time. Also it would be for a long time from now.

Just wanted to share this with people who understand.  I can't share this with anyone in my life cause they all think I'm clean.  Wish me luck in the badlands tomorrow and be safe.  ",1517515815.0
7uljqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7uljqx/first_time_iving_myselfand_an_update/,4,https://redd.it/7uljqx,dyingsober,first time IVing myself..and an update,"To start off. The first time I ever used heroin I let the person who offered to share to shoot me up. I was 17 and he was older than me. He was very eager to get me to try it, despite me saying no a few occasions prior. I was very upset in the moment. He said it would make me feel better. I was in IOP and got drug tested 3 times a week. I would be clean by my next drug test.
It was a very small amount. It took several times, I have very small veins that are hard to get into. it’s always been a problem when I get blood work. They usually do it in my hand, and that’s were it was done. I had snorted a small amount before he shot me up.
I felt little to nothing, at least I thought so, but he said he had missed my vein when he first when in, and was in my muscle, and I didn’t even realize, I felt no pain..  I remember liking that. I got mono when I was younger, and I’ve had chronic pain since, nothing bad enough to be treated for, but I was always achy, my joints hurt, I felt like I was too young to be in this pain. 

I started using not long ago at all... I first tried it in September or October... weekly use turned into twice a week, then daily. The reason I even used at all? I was in IOP for weed because i would get my legal charges dropped... I didn’t realize how uncomfortable I was sober. I just didn’t want to be coherent. I couldn’t handle life like that. Call me weak, I suppose. Years of therapy and medication and yet very little put me at ease or less of a mess. I am only 18 now. I was a messed up kid and I fear I’ll be a messed up adult. I wanted to take back control of my life. And of course, my fiancé plans to stop. That reason alone I will never look back. I will support him endlessly, through the detox and I’ll write to him with he goes to rehab... and we can live a normal life together. By no means sober, but enjoying a blunt or even a benzo occasionally... neither of us can control ourselves when it comes to heroin. It has its grip on us.

Sometime in January I stopped cold turkey. I do not what warrants as a bad addiction, I did not think I was addicted, I still don’t know. My fiancé says I’m in really bad denial. Fair enough. Most likely. You never realize how you look from an outsiders perspective.. I was very clearly on drugs... my parents started to catch on, I quickly dismissed them pleading that I knew nothing, even when they had found a sealed stamped bag in my room... 

I never experienced withdrawals until when I tried to stopI could go around 48 hours without any ill effects.  But this time I went longer than two days. I was hurting. I’ve never felt pain, such bad aches, my bones hurt, I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t get comfortable... I was sitting up in my boyfriend’s bed just crying for hours... weed wasn’t helping, Advil didn’t help, NyQuil... I couldn’t cope. I did maybe a small bump or two when I was stopping... like scrapes off a bag or left over on the desk... I didn’t use for maybe a week. Maybe a little longer. I did it, I was still hurting slightly but I did it right ? I wasn’t going to go back. My fiancé however can’t just stop like that.. he needs to go to treatment. But he can’t until he graduates and gets his degree, or else he will lose his credits. So he’s waiting until may. He would ask to borrow money for bundles. He was using in front of me, him at his desk, me in his bed trying to pretend I didn’t hear him snorting. 

All I thought about was heroin. 

So I went back. I am using a lot less and a lot less frequently than I was. I don’t plan on doing this much longer. I woke up in the middle of the night about five days ago. I ordered insulin needles. U-100 0.5cc  30G x 1/2. It was the best selling. Pack of ten. Five dollars. Free shipping.

I mentioned it to my boyfriend, he got very upset. Even threatened to break up with me if I did it. But I do doubt that. I brought it up again today because they came. He got very upset, said whatever fuck it.

And I was selfish. I just wanted to try. I mixed two bags and some water. I usually boof. But I thought it needed to be filtered so I put some cotton in. Pulled it in, tapped it, made sure there was no air bubbles.
Poked myself over and over. Trying to register. No luck. Mostly in my left hand and arm. I switched to a new rig, I thought maybe the needle was too dull now. I Am right handed, but I used my left hand to shoot in my right hand. I registered. I pushed down slowly. It looked like my hand was getting swollen at the injection site, so I stopped. Rubbed it to avoid an abscess. Got another spot, registered, and finished it. I boofed the remaining water. Keep rubbing my hand. Slightly numb, I wonder if I slipped out of the vein. I’m about to get into the hot shower and massage it again, that’s how I was told  to prevent abscesses.

Honestly I didn’t like it. I was scared. It felt wrong. It made me wish I never started using. I felt low.
I don’t think I’ll do it again.
I feel guilty.
And I know it hurt my fiancé.

This shit really brings out the absolute worst in me.

So this may a be a bit long, but if you're high and have a minute, give it a read.

Quick run down of how I got to where I'm at. Joined the US Army after Highschool. Found myself in some shitty situations, tried heroin (smoked it) for the first time and got my leg blown off 3 days before coming home (amputation below the knee). Got all rehabbed up, nice little medical retirement, plus disability and some other allowances for having a fake leg. All and all comes out to about $3700 a month. Got pretty bored at home not doing shit so I moved to the country my Mom came from, Ukraine. 

Now 3700 USD in Ukraine is a fucking fortune, and boy have I lived it up and I've been here since 2012....

Ok, now you're caught up. Every day I drink about 6 liters of beer, 1 liter of vodka, pop 2.5g of Alprazolama and smoke 1 gram of that sweet sweet brown Afghan H. Thats just to not get sick. If I wanna get fucked up, It's usually much more than that, plus some coke. Obviously I didn't start off this way, but this is where I'm at now, and I've been at this level for about 6 months, it will only get worse from here. 

I recently had a situation where I took too much H (I think it was cut with fent or something else) and experienced an overdose. But who knows, with all I drink and the benzos I take. Either way, its time for me to get clean. So I went to a doctor here in Ukraine and they literally just said ""Just stop doing all that stuff""....yeah okay dude. 

I have pretty good insurance, its called Tricare and they cover some inpatient treatment and medical detox. Detoxing here in Ukraine isn't an option. The hospitals here look like the fucking movie Hostel. My current plan is to get to the American Hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, check myself and have them do their thing.
 (this is the same place I was MEDEVACed in 2010). I'm just wondering what you guys think. Am I too deep in this bullshit and should I just keep living this life until I die in the next couple years (or months), or should I get my my car, drive to Landstuhl and try to survive an alcohol, benzo and opiate withdrawal? Would love to hear your opinions guys and gals. 

Also AMA, I know I've lived quite an ""Alternative"" lifestyle as my very disipointed mother tells me lol. 

Love you guys

UPDATE: Ok guys, I've decided I'm gonna try to get some methadone (or the Ukrainian equivalent) to travel with, as crossing international borders with 10g of H just seems like a bad idea. I'll have enough benzos to get me to Germany and can pick up alcohol along the way if I need it. Going to see the Doc. Tomorrow and see what he says about the methadone script then head west. My car is big enough to sleep in and I've got plenty of money saved up for hotels. I'll keep you guys updated.",1517686122.0

Any ideas?,"TLDR: i just shot a speedball with a little less coke than usual and unexpectedly started nodding out whilst writing this post on how much I love speedballs. Now it's a lost about unexpected nods, too. Still nodding hard, going with the pirate eye lol. Asking for ideas and experiences from you guys regarding the nod. I'm a bit afraid that fent might become a thing around here. How long would the fent high last tho? 






Today I had to take the TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language, for my masters application) which means that when uni starts on Monday, I didn't really have any free time between work and uni except the rest of today and tomorrow since... Christmas. Tho Christmas doesn't really count. Had to study for the oral exam I took in Jan. But at least I had some time off work then. (My last 'vacation' was my ibogaine treatment in Spain last spring. It worked as advertised but I didn't and relapsed anyways lol.) 





So naturally I feel like I have to use this free time wisely and treat myself. I kinda rushed through the TOEFL and finished first. Then the notorious auto pilot in my head turned on and I scored some dope (got a good deal on it too! He threw in one extra bubble bc I waited in the cold until I couldn't feel my hands anymore only to find that he doesn't have coke). So I had to get the girl elsewhere. Thought for a sec about ordering the coke taxi but then I'd have to buy at least a gram. And that's a dangerous amount to have for me. I gotta be up and running by Monday! And so I waited some more in the cold. The coke man came by car which he usually doesn't. I waited where we usually meet, headphones in, eyes locked to the screen, when a (very small) stone hit me. And I was like - is someone throwing rocks (pun not intended) at me? Well it was him lol. 




Anyways, what is super weird is the following. I prepped a shot and put in a little less coke than usual, but just as much dope as before, not more, maybe even a little less. I wanted to continue to tidy my room, but when I took my phone to turn on some music and share my joy on reddit I noticed I was nodding off bc I had only one eye open... Instead of doing sth about it (that was at least an hour ago) I'm still sitting here enjoying the nod and browsing the internet. Haven't even removed the tourniquet yet lol.
 I was so focused on speedballs during the last months that I kinda forgot how nice it is to catch a simple nod off of dope and not only to get me to sleep.  




But what worries me is *why* this happened. Has the time already come that our dope is being cut w fent? My tolerance is super high, usually it takes a lot to get me nodding like this. Especially since I had been using about 1.8g dope on top of my 1000mg maintenance morphin during my binge, just to provide some context. Especially when there's coke in the shot. Like, ftw How did this happen? Any ideas? Experiences? 




 And dude, I'm still nodding out. Typing this took forever and I apologize for any lack of coherence, grammar or spelling. I'd really like to have another shot but this nodding is crazy... Just was out again!





PS: I'll follow up with dopepr0n when I do the next shot.

Dose to only 8 mg per day.

After starting Suboxone I noticed that I was getting A LOT MORE emotional and I would start crying while I was by myself thinking of past events (things I've never done before).. 

So like I said to make a long story short I've been trying not to use Suboxone because I do not want to be on it anymore but I have two pieces of my spine that are fused together which causes me tremendous amount of pain.  For a while Suboxone did help but lately it has not been doing the job and it's been excruciating. 

Not sure what to do considering there is no pain management (as far as I know) while on Suboxone. 

Yesterday I didn't use the box in which didn't seem to be a problem because I started using Xanax to help with the with withdrawl symptoms, but today is a completely different day and I can feel the sweaty palms, heart palpitations, Extreme anxiety , etc..it's the cold sweats that's really killing me right now (not to mention it's fucking freezing where I am)

TL;DR Can someone tell me how they did it themselves after tapering off from a very low dose of Suboxone to know Suboxone at all with minimal with drawl symptoms? ",1517672548.0

When i came back to earth, i felt so guilty for laying in bed for 2 days (by that point i was well enough to get back to work). Yet on heroin i was fully content to lie in bed for weeks, months...

I honestly believe ill never do heroin again. which is huge for me, as ive tried to quit (and gotten through w/d) only to start again what feels like 100 times.

I'm a daily tar user and got called for a interview next week. My plan is to switch to subs this weekend or possibly kratom. I'm not worried about the drug test itself (if offered) since I'm not going to try to cheat it.

I am wondering for anyone who recently had a job interview, did they drug test you the same day (if required), or did they drug test you only after they've offered you the job? And if so, how long after the interview did they drug test you, what method, etc?

Reason I ask is so I know I have enough time to be clear of H without having to worry about drinking 2 gallons of water a day/etc. Also, in case if i fail to induct to subs/kratom properly this weekend and was still using the day of the interview, would I have to be worried about a same day drug test or not.

I was under the impression that there is no possible way one can use it at all and be psychologically healthy. Every description of a day in the life of a drug addict on TV sounds horrid

https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/nedgad/canada-is-prescribing-heroin-to-treat-opioid-addiction

I stumbled upon this article the other day. I can just sum it up as talking about how Canada opiate maintenance programs have been overwhelmingly positive. I have been told all these horrible things and stories about heroin but in this article they depict people with full blown legal opiate addictions functioning fairly normally. What the flying fuck? this gentleman is talking about going to school?

>Having a steady and clean supply means Cooper has stopped committing crimes, and recently rented his first apartment. The prescription injection doesn’t make him feel high and out of control like before. “You get your warm glow, but it’s different from when you’re desperate with nothing, ducking in a doorway,” he said recently after taking one of his doses. He’s thinking about going back to school and upgrading his first aid certification.

I am not one of those people who thinks that all drug users should go to jail. But this is a very strange idea to me. I did more digging and found this

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin-assisted_treatment

>Thus, patients in heroin-assisted treatment are relieved from the major complex of problems that defines illicit heroin use. Synthetic heroin taken under the aforementioned conditions is not neurotoxic and has few long-term side effects beside constipation and dependency.

This sort of flies in the face of this video which I found online

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9huWlXFA1s

This video portrays heroin as a scary horrid thing

I hope I am making sense here. But I live in a large city, come from a good family and earn good money. I have a college education and have experimented with drugs like coke, xanax, adderal, mdma, shrooms, and weed. I never found any of them that interesting outside of shrooms and just lost interest after I quit weed and stopped associating with that friend group. I step outside and see drug addicts shooting up in plain sight. I presume that they are homeless, thats why they do this in the streets. And I presume that they just don't give a fuck about life anymore. Why is it that 80% of heroin addicts in netherlands hold full time jobs? while heroin addicts in the states suffer so much?

I know it may seem like a silly question, but how bad is heroin? This all sort of confusing. I don't mean this in an offensive way, I am genuinely curious

I am a software engineer. I wakeup at 6am, workout/do yoga, drink coffee and work. I read about medicine, nutrition, spirituality, and personal finance when I come home. Based on what I know, most people could not do this if they were on heroin? so why is it we see such different outcomes with the same drug in different countries? Is it just the issue of money? and if so, could I hypothetically do everything that I do in the course of a day on heroin? From what I know its fairly debilitating. how can one go to school like this?

I'd like to mention that I recently moved to a bigger metropolitan than the previous city I was in.

The guy I normally go through is out of town, which isn't an issue. I've dealt with addiction for 8 years so I was ready to go through the withdrawals, it's nothing new and I enjoy taking a break to reflect.

Side note - r/kratom is the perfect substitute when it comes to dealing with withdrawals.

I'd like to state I no longer fear for withdrawals anymore, KRATOM for me personally gets rid of ALL the withdrawal symptoms and I was able to go 6 days with no type of opiates, and I couldn't have felt better.

Decided to say fuck if, I got myself back into a decent career and decided to try and cold cop.
Whisper App was no luck and I was unsure of how else to obtain, until I realized how easy it is no matter what city you're in.

Straight went downtown to the ""Needle Exchange Center"". If you're unfamiliar; needle exchange is pretty straight forward, you exchange your old used up dull needles for new ones.

Met a gentleman who was the same age as me except he had nothing to his name and lived off the streets.

I just paid rent and felt genuinely bad for the guy, I hate to help feed others addiction but fuck, the guy was going to boost shit and sell it for dope later on that day anyway he stated.

He was a nice guy, I told him I don't fuck around and ""junkies"" (I hate that word) should help each other out instead of stealing from each other.

Told him if he can get me a ball, I'll buy him 0.5 for himself. 

This guy almost cried lmao. 

It reminded me how evil this shit is; everything was going completely wrong for this guy, but the fact I bought him his own 0.5, he was overwhelmed with emotion.

He told me since basically his entire adult life, after his mom died, he has been living off of the streets. Always looking over his shoulder, and trusting no one.

Long story short, he was overwhelmed with emotion since he feels society has disowned him and is no longer accepted. Meaning ""no one has helped me"" type of situation the guy was expressing towards me.

José, I know you won't see this - but keep your head up. 

You stated you have nothing to your name but a horrible addiction, and somehow are able to smile through the entire day with or without heroin.

And even though it's just the first day I feel so free already. They gave me 30mgs and I still have some cold sweats but NOTHING compared to what I was going through during my intake. Also everyone I met was so nice and supportive and seemed like they actually care about the people and not the money. The doctor seemed a little too dose happy but overall a nice guy. 
I'm so excited to get my life back on track and start picking up all the pieces that is my broken life. 
Even better my dad helped me pay and him and my mom are more than on board and extremely supportive of me. Which I know I am very very lucky for. After my dad left a lot of patients at the clinic told me how lucky I am that my family is that supportive and willing to pay for it until I get back on my feet and can afford it. 

Just feeling really really good right now and wanted to share. If you're on methadone and have any tips I would love to hear them! I plan on staying on the lowest dose possible im not going to get a legal high / buzz I 100% whole heartedly want to just feel normal and be on a stable dose and worry about tapering down when I cross that bridge. My counselor told me usually around a year or two is when people start tapering if they're ready which sounds like a good plan to me. 

How's everyone doing today? Hopefully not sick and having happy nods. If you're thinking about getting on MMT and the stigma is stopping you, I say just do it. The myths about it aren't 100% true. You don't have to be on it for life unless you want to. I'm just kicking myself that I didn't do this earlier I could of saved so much time and not ruined my life so badly.

Story time ladies and gentlemen.,"*edit* i meant “Put yourself through”. Cant edit the thread title i guess. 

Obviously many times I returned change, returned soda cans for deposit, and pawned shit.  But i have two bigguns.  One time i was so desperate, I called the dopeman and asked him if he would give me a half g (lowest amt he sold) if i let him buy groceries with my foodstamp card.  He said if you give me double, ill do it.  40=cost 80= amount of food he wanted.   So i had to go grocery shopping in the hood, with a G ass black dude that I only saw for a few seconds each day.  (White suburban dude over here).   Surprisingly we had a decent conversation in the store.  

But my worst experience was when i used to buy red bull on my foodstamp card and sell them to a liquor store in the hood for half price amd get the cash.  I did that each month until I had no more money on the card.  Then i graduated to liberating red bull from stores and selling them.  I took 8 12 packs from a store.  Loaded em up in a cart and walked the fuck out. Dumb as hell, but desperate.   Now on occasion, there would be a cop just bullshitting behind the bulletproof glass with the liquor store owner, so when I pulled up that day and saw a cop car, i didnt think twice. I had nothing on me, so i had no worries.  I was just going to wait until he dipped and then go in w the cases.   A few minutes go by and I see a plainclothes cop w a vest on walking up to my car, and he looks in my backseat and sees all these cases of red bull.  He was going to tell me that the store was closed, until he saw the redbull. Turns out all the unmarked cars in the lot were cop cars as well, and the store was getting raided by The Vice department for buying stolen goods for resale.  Now in my city, big midwestern place where they make cars, these cops dont fuck around.  They knew exactly what i was doing, and why I was doing it.  Immediately the cop pulls me out of the car, pats me down and starts asking me where the drugs were.  I told them that I didnt have any drugs, and they didnt find any drugs either.  Or rigs cuz i snorted only.  I told them i bought the shit with my foodstamps and they asked for a receipt, and I told them you really think i would keep my recoept for evidence of me pulling this fraud?  They bought it i guess and after a few minutes of them trying to get me to snitch, they let me go.  They could tell i was dopesick, and i straight up told them I was an addict, and i didnt have anything on me.  But i wasnt about to snitch.  The consequences of what I did that day did not outweigh getting shot or my house shot up.  These dopemen i fucked w were hood as fuck and would definitely fuck you up or kill you for snitching.  I cant believe i put myself in some of the places and situations i did and never got robbed or roughed up but thats another story.  

So I guess since i was honest with them and i didnt have any dope on me, and they couldnt prove that I stole the redbull, they let me go.

Like almost a year. Since then ive taken kratom and sometimes little bits of methadone, but off of the spending hundreds of dollars a week on heroin fentanyl mix off the street though, and since dnms got all fucky i havent bothered loggin back in. 

So my life is slowly, slightly getting better, i tell myself, it really isnt by normal standards as im stuck spinning my wheels it feels like, for reasons, but about once a month like clockwork, down to the fuckin day, i get really different feeling, i feel like i used to feel all the time, somewhat more creative, calm, in touch, but i also really really really really really really really very much badly so want to get a bag of smack and get high. Its never good anymore, the dope is cutup fentanyl death garbage heroin and i get so sick to my stomach off it and spend all night in the bathroom throwing up skittles and various sour candies. 

But i still want it. I discarded all my numbers, so i have to cold cop , but its all the same shitty dope anywyas. 

But  my dgirl was like the only person i liked and now that i cut her out of my life i miss her badly, i really liked her, i didnt just want to fuck her either, i seriously would have been fine just hanging out wih her for a few here and there. Im really worried about her, i am thinking of sending her a present, what should i buy for a stylish girl teenage drug dealer? I hate to admit this, but if i find out she died i will be super jealous of her. I know how fucked up that sounds but just thinking of losing another friend to the eternal mist makes me feel so lonely, its almost depressing getting high off dope i didnt buy from her, i domt know how to explain it better than that. Its just this fucked up feeling. I smoke so much pot to distract myself but lately it just gives me mad introspection and i hate that shit all the time. 


I remember being strung out, i remmeber withdrawals, i dont want that, i just want to snort a tiny bag and feel that touch of bliss again, its brutal sometimes. Oh well. Hopefully some u lil niggas can relate. Anyone just want to die sometimes but not really at the same time? I feel like i know what i want but also i dont and even if i did i wouldnt be able to get it 

Does anyone want to start a gang with me? We will wear leather jackets and talk like the fonz

He looked like a regular dude but in work clothes more or less. 

What I *did* notice is his arms were goose bumped and he looked cold as fuck but it wasn't particularly cold outside. He seemed like he had a bad cold so I figured he was in WD and needed a fix.

There's no H where I live - just pills btw. Anyway, he asks me if i can spare a couple bucks and I give him a $20. Something I've wished would happen to me for years when I was asking people for cash a long time ago.

I don't think he expected me to give it to him. I think he thought I was going to pass the $20 for the dollars I had alongside it and give him just a couple of those lol.

His eyes got huge and you could see the fucking relief wash over his face - I was his answered prayer and it felt **amazing** to be the good guy for once.

I told him it was none of my business but, I said, ""now that you got cash, do you have a solid place to score at?"" He looked at me like he hadn't decided if he was going to lie or just say fuck it and cop to the truth - he went with the truth and laughed and said ""Yeah, man I do.""

He thanked me over and over and we parted ways. I'm sure I'll see him again. I'm pretty sure I've seen him around.

If I had to guess I would really say closer to like 10 or 11 months ... I've made a lot of mistakes in those years ...

I'm honestly really scared ... I've never felt that from my addiction (and it has deffinantly brought me to my knees countless times, I spent years strungout living outside on the streets and in traps) ... I've been doing really reckless shots ( I only shoot speedball also, although I'm currently using crack instead of coke because I don't live in a huge city and dimes and dubs of powder are not really super common but I CAN get really good hard) either way I am certain if it wasn't for my built up tolerance from suboxen I would be dead ... and even still I've deffinantly come close a couple times in the past two day ... today I did a 3 and 1 and I was so sure I was gonna fall out I started texting a goodbye letter to my girl daughter and mom ... however I didn't and I immediately went and copped again right after... this shit is bananas ... any words of encouragement and or advice would be greatly appreciated ...

Come thru 

Plz

I get there and ask him where the buyer is. 

""Oh I don't have one lined up yet we gotta figure it out."" God damn it Bud. God damn it. You're lucky I love the shit outta you. We have a ""maybe"" in a city 2 hours away, so I had him make a Craigslist ad for it, he said he might consider ebay. Then we get like 4 other people over, I chainsmoke while they smoke heroin and there's a pile of random shit everybody is sitting on their phones trying to sell with the cello at the head leaned against the wall. 

Bud has been freaking out the past 2 days about getting gel pens, as many as possible with as many colors as possible. He has... What I would assume is the largest size Ziploc bag about half full so far. I left about 2 hours ago to boost for someone and got him some gel pens, gonna head back soon. One of you fuckers needs to buy this cello and I need to get the doctors okay to get a real job.

Even though not a proper miracle, it helped and it's a godsend.","I've combed through hundreds of research papers looking for something that was different from commonly prescribed SSRIs/NDRIs and other common medications.

I picked up in one research paper that depression can cause your endogenous opioid levels to drop (strange thing is that the data in that paper was trash, but the premise was sound) and also found Tianeptine in other overview research paper that was comparing various atypical antidepressants (that do not act directly on serotonine or dopamine).

At first, I was a bit concerned about taking another opoid that is mju receptor agonist for prolonged time (because it basically means addiction).

But when I tried it...it worked almost instantly. It's not all happiness and peaches, but at least I can fairly confidently say I am no longer depressed (or at least not as much depressed as before).

The question I am pondering is whether I should have a stop after let's say two weeks for a day or two, just to test the addiction potential. Tianeptine is short-acting (few hours), so getting clean of its effects, including withdrawal, shouldn't take longer than two days.

Anyone here took Tianeptine for longer periods of time (months, years)? Could you also comment on tolerance build up?",1517709873.0

Well what ended up happening is that the withdrawal was about 1/100th as bad as I thought it was going to be. I think because of the taper.

I don’t have many close homies, and the ones I do are probably sick and tired of me but hung about it. But basically back in Spring of ‘17 I was hustling with my baby mama. Life was damn good! We both were working and used that money to pay the bills. And meth was selling in our town for fucking $120 a gram all day. So we spoiled our daughter, and for a good while there all we did was smoke weed. My daughter was never around drugs by my hand. But... shit started to change. We started making less and less money, because baby mama was dipping into the supply. I honestly didn’t notice for a LONG time. But eventually it became obvious.

I started having to lock the dope up at a locker at my place of work. I’d give her an allowance but she’d need more and more and MORE! Until we started getting into vicious fights about it. Eventually she got me locked up, stole all our money and split out of the state with my daughter. She’s out where drugs are much more scarce, and she’s NEVER been a bad mother so I’m not worried... definitely miss my baby girl because she was my best friend hands down. Used to have tea parties and dance parties every day with that little rascal... but I get to FaceTime her and visit when I can. So it’s okay now.

I ended up moving back home and meeting this TIGHT 18 yr old friend of my sisters. This chick was a cutie and was only 4 foot and 9 inches. That’s a legal fucking MIDGET homie. I swear to god that pussy was the best I will EVER encounter. We fucked 3 times the first night we hung out inside a hotel room I purchased. She had no idea that I was back to my shit... doing a little bit of heroin and pills whenever I could get away. Eventually she caught me, and she actually wanted to do it! At first I thought it was amazing and I started getting back into the pill game selling and smoking em up. She fell in love with me, but would say shit like “these [pills] just make me love you so much more” hahahaha so right there I knew how this was gonna end up. 

I got a job opportunity out of town that was too good to pass up on. She moved with me, but not before pushing me (didn’t have to push to hard) to rob my pill dealing (close family member). We dipped to this hotel two and a half hours away from home were I was gonna start working. And that’s when shit when down hill. My pill dealing fam called me out and shit. She ended up fighting with me about it, and SHE flushed all of my fucking pills. I’m talking 15 of the 30 M’s, probably about two dozen Morphines, and a shit ton of Xanax. Idek how much haha. 

After she flushed the pills the next day she was withdrawing hard. She had never done hard drugs before, and she blamed everything on me. Which ya know... some of it was my b. I was more than eager to get her hooked like me. But anyway, she ended up robbing me while I lay in bed dying, taking my clothes, and taking the car that we took out there. She dipped back home without me, and while the car was technically hers and all... I just paid outrageous amounts to fix it up and get it inspected and registered. So that was fucked. Me and her have hooked up a few times since the break up, just because I probably won’t ever be able to turn down that midget pussy. Just take my word for it, it’s the wettest tightest shit in the fucking world lmfaooo. 

A few months after our break up the legal midget girl moved out of state to stay with her cousins. I text her occasionally and I’d do anything to get back with that girl. And not just for the world class chocha. She was a good one for sure. But anyway I was back on the prowl. 

At this point I was single and I was back ON man. Started feeling proud about myself again. Got a GOOD job working my ass off in a ducking coal mine. I showed up lit as shit everyday and had an amazing Junky Credit Score. Dealers in my home town were like in love with me lmfao. And while I was out partying with my mostly drug free friends, I met another girl who I still consider to be light years out of my league. 

She had that vibe where you could tell she used to be goth in high school, but now she just wore black and got tattoos. Her hair was dark and her skin was like an olive color. She ended up slipping to me that she ‘liked heroin’ while it was just me and her sharing a smoke outside. My eyes probably lit up like Christmas. I told her if she wanted to get high she just had to give me a ride. I ended up not being able to score that night. But for the next week all we did was kick it when I was off work and smoke tar. 

I eventually got ousted from my home because of drug use, and lost my ride to work. I lost the job, but used my last check to go on one hell of a binge with that girl. It took a surprisingly long time before we actually hooked up. But when we did I was glad. She had that junky style skinny that we all know fairly well. And I honestly think that is the hottest type of body there is...

We just got hotel rooms, racked up drug debts, and fucked. We had a lot of fun, except for the times my dick was to drugged out to work lmdaooo. I got her to eat my ass one time lmfao! I’m not into fingers up there, but a tongue feels heavenly. Eventually my money ran out though, so we were living at my grandmas and eating off her allowance from her mother (chick was 19 but still dependent on her rich ass momma). That just stresses any situation out a lot, and I knew it was bound to end. I caught mad feelings for that girl, but I’m just to high anymore to give a fuck. Even she fucking moved though! Like 3 hours away hahah! They all **really leave** when they ‘leave’ me hahaha. Me and her still text too, and I’m gonna be visiting her in her town soon. Cause she might not have been as wet or tight as the midget girl, this girl is stunning and so much better at having sex. Skills pay the bills baby. ",1517821061.0

So, if any melbournians/australians are aware, Codeine is prescription only, which is a horrible decision, not because i want a cheap high that will kill my liver, but because people have legitimate pain and the government really thinks that it would solve the opiate crisis...

If you're not aware of my situation, im 23 and i have chronic back pain, or, sciatica, with spinal stenosis and scoliosis, all of which aggravates my back a crapload.

I'm stuck on what american's call tylenol 3, (500mg paracetamol, 30mg codeine), it doesn't even tough the pain but it does enough for me to not cry out in pain every time i move. I'm fucking sick of relying on pills to feel somewhat better, but it's the only option i have... i tried requesting for shit like low dose oxycodone, just so i can get an alternative treatment or atleast a different pill that can help, no-go, the doctors here are tighter then a nuns cunt. I got prescribed 200 panadeine fortes (sorry, tylenol 3's), and im already almost out (got them on the 20th of last month)... i know its an unhealthy amount im taking, but its either take the recommended dosages and still be in pain or step it up and risk liver fucking damage, which is my biggest fear. 

I know people recommend the CWE (?) method, but if i remember correctly, codeine and paracetamol work well together, and codeine alone isn't much of a pain killer, its more of a recreational thing... but im stuck between a fucking rock and a hard place and already this year ive thought about doing myself in. Pain is horrible every day, i wake up and i can't move unless i literally roll to the other side of the bed, take my pills, wait in agony for an hour until they kick in and then i can slowly get up and walk around, im fucking 23 and i feel like a WW2 vet with 70 year old injuries. Every day i wake up crying, both in sadness and in pain as i realise that this is my life now. 

I hate opiates, and i love them too, i hate the negative stigma around them but i also understand them, im so confused about life right now, and for the past 4 years i feel like ive been living on these pills more then on life itself. 

Even now im practically sobbing, you guys might see me as a username who can type but fucking oath ive been battling this horrific pain for almost 5 years and im sick of it.

Not to mention my painkillers (200 T3's) run out in 2-3 days and withdrawals + incredible back pain is going to send me over the edge, and im scared.

I have been taking Nucynta 100mgs (instant not SR) for about 2 weeks now, every day while slowly upping my dosages until ive been taking around 450 a day spread out over the day/evening for the past 10 days. I saw my guy the other day and he's out. So i have 6 tablets left. My SO doesn't know ive been taking them. Ive been using them for pain relief and recreationally. Ive been taking avg 7 panadine forte (30mg codeine) prescribed for a few years now which aside from 10 days on prescribed oxynorm for a back injury are my only experience with opiates.
Just wondering how bad the withdrawals from just the Nucynta will be? And how many days roughly? Especially bc im a new timer to opiates (but plenty of experience with other things). I'll have my panadeine and i have prescribed benzos and a 50 box of etizieal 1 to help me get through wd, but im deciding whether to take my last 6 for fun today and tomorrow or to use them to taper. Also any tips bc i gotta hide this from my partner and neither of us work at the moment so we are home together all day. I think just getting blitzed on diaz and trying to sleep will be best yes??? And the panadeine to help the pain?

I have a little more than a 8mg strip so probably about 12 mg total.

1) what's the best way to go about a taper? I want to do it in the shortest time possible to make it as easy and painless as I can. 

2) after tapering, if I do it right, will I really have any physical symptoms ? In the past I've had minor aches and low energy but the worst was the cravings.

3) what would (in your opinions) be the worst thing I'll have to deal with? I know the depression and lethargy will be the main culprit but I'm mainly concerned about physical stuff. 

4) if I do the taper right, am I going to have to deal with RLS or can that be avoided? That's my biggest concern because I honestly cannot stand the restless legs. My girl hates it as well and she thinks I'm already through the process so I don't want to be kicking her at night and tossing and turning ... I'm not worried about not being able to sleep really.

5) if I do have some minor aches, what can I do to alleviate them? Just Tylenol and such? 

6) is there anything to help combat RLS if I'm stricken with it once I'm off the sub? I just really fucking hate it. 

7) after I'm through with the taper and all I need to function and do stuff. I have school and an internship and I need to be able to function well at these things. I can't take time off or anything so I want to make sure I'm alright. 

8) I don't WANT to do this but if I end up having a bad day for RLS or something would using a small amount of dope to alleviate it put me back to day one and make me have to withdrawal for a week and start the process over ? Like I said I do not want to do this but hypothetically if I used one day would it fuck everything up in the physical standpoint ?

9) how long til I start feeling ""normal""? Last time I tapered was at a rehab and I did a 10 day taper but I started at 16mg and went down to 2mg on the last day of it and i didn't really have any physical symptoms, it was more just a lack of energy and the mental stuff like depression and anxiety. 

Sorry about all the questions but I just wanna do this right and I don't have the option of going to rehab or taking a few weeks off to get myself back to normal.

TL;DR- I need to taper with sub and I want to do it in the shortest amount of time possible. If I do a taper over a week or so, will I be able to function as a person and do all of the stuff I have to do without feeling too uncomfortable? The mental stuff is fine I can deal with that. I just don't want to be physically sick because that makes it really hard. Also, will I face any RLS if I do it correctly and if so what can I do to manage that? 

I just want to taper off of the sub and get back to normal. I'm ready to be done. ",1517791689.0

I already know and firmly believe that his emergency is not my crisis. He forgot that his roxy appointment is Monday and he didn't set aside any money to pay for a cab. So I guess he was hoping he could get me to help him somehow even though I have no money aside from the money I spent yesterday on my awesome haircut (I go to an Italian ""stylist""). 


&nbsp;

So I just texted him some background about my condition, specifically that I had no money to spare aside from $8 left over from an Uber gift card. I know if I pay for his Uber, he'd pay me back with roxies but it would be a one-way ride.


His response to this information?

**Cliff: Jesus, wtf am I going to do 2mrrw?**


Followed by,

Cliff: Stil at work?        --     (I'm actually home but I want to ensure I'm left alone to enjoy my day off until I'm ready to speak to him in person)


Cliff: Let me know when you leave work. (Does it really matter?


&nbsp;



So I'm not sure how he expects me to help him tomorrow aside form physically biking to the pharmacy to pick up his roxy script, BUT **there is a bonus**.



This time, when I visit Cliff's house to talk about plans for tomorrow, it is **very likely** that I will finally inform Cliff that I will not be spending my pay day money on dope this week. 



#The next Cliffpost will showcase how Cliff responds to that news.

Update: Before I went on my merry way, he didn't ask me what I plan to do on pay day and he was so focused on what he was going to do tomorrow. So tomorrow, when I receive the handful of pills he owes me, he's gonna ask me what I plan to buy on pay day (dope) so that he can decide how many more pills to give me. It is at that point in time I'll have to inform him of what I'm not spending money on.


The next Cliff post will still contain the aforementioned reaction. ",1517789535.0

It has been about 48hrs since my last oxy and tbh the WD haven’t been that bad but they still suck. 

I couldn’t sleep lastnight so I stayed up all night tossing and turning my legs can’t stop moving and feeling cramped up, horrible back pains and I can’t remember the last time I slept everything is a fuzzy blur. 

I have (3) 8mg Suboxone but I have never taken subs before and I really did not want to take the chances of going thru percipitated WD. 

Anyways I was able to make it to a near by smoke shop that has brand name Kratom and got a couple ounces... took 8 grams and boy do I feel great, all my WD symptoms are gone. 

Kratom is a miracle sent from the nature gods. 

Not sure what I would do without it. Probably pop an oxy, right? Right.

Have a few questions (I don't take opiates.)","Don't get me wrong, I've got high before. I loved benzos and class A's when I was in my 20s.

But I got married, had a kid and grew out of all that.  The friends I lost got into heroin, two of them are now dead.  One was 29, the other 41 years old. Gone too early.  They used to party with me, I grew out of it and ""got boring"", they got into H.  I never did speak to them when finding out because I didn't want to be around it.

I'm intrigued by opiates because I know that I would love them.  But I won't start them because I have an addictive personality and my son means the world to me.

Anyway, a few questions if I'm allowed?

1. Do you all live in decent accommodation and keep it clean/tidy or are the Trainspotting scenes realistic? I am a clean freak and the thought of getting high surrounded by dirt and mess doesn't appeal to me at all. 

2. Some of you have $30-$50 a day habits. How on earth do you afford this? I just don't understand what a 'hustle' is? 

3. What do you look forward to? Like, do you get depressed knowing that you've always got to go and score more gear tomorrow, and the day after, and then the day after etc etc?


Apologies if my questions are too personal. This seems like a great sub and I'm not here to troll. I guess I want to know what the friends I lost went through, how they lived etc. I miss them and wish that I got to say goodbye.",1517775367.0

Oh well oh well so here we stand
But we stand for nothing
My heart calls to me in my sleep
How can I turn to it
'Cause I'm all locked up in this
Dark place -
And I do not know
I'm as good as dead
My head aches -
Warped and tied up
I need to kill this pain

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm six feet underground

How long I'm tied up
My mind in knots -
My stomach reels
In concern for what I might do or
What I've don
It's got me living in fear
Well I know these voices must
Be my soul
I've had enough I've had enough of being alone
I've got no place to go

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm six feet under ground

Six feet under
In my grave
Lying wired and shut and quiet in my grave
Leave me here
Leave me here to waste here
So young and here I am again
Talking to myself
As a T.V. blares
Oh man
Oh how I wish I didn't smoke
Or drink to reason with my head

But sometimes this thick confusion
Grows until I cannot bear it at all
Needle to the vein
Needle to the vein
Take this needle from my vein my friend
I said

My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone
My head won't leave my head alone
And I don't believe it will
Until I'm dead and gone

In my grave
Lying
Lying cold in my grave
The reason -
My reason
Take my head off this terror
The fearing won't come back
I can't see
My mind's all wiped clean
The needle
Make my great escape
I seem caught in time
My head leaves me behind
Body falls cold
And I see heaven",1517775003.0
7v96ad,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7v96ad/better_than_sex/,8,https://redd.it/7v96ad,SixCylinder777,"""Better than sex""","Kinda a shitpost, but I've always heard people say this about heroin, and I don't think the comparison is right. 

Sex is obviously amazing, but after a while it loses its allure and you realize that sex usually comes with some sort of emotional baggage and is much better when done with someone you care about. Sex and orgasms are very nice, but like you can't compare it to heroin, heroin comes with problems obviously more so than sex. But the sheer euphoria of heroin/hard opiates is something that doesn't exist anywhere else. They are just too different to compare, like apples and oranges, 

Sex is, if you take the necessary precautions, a healthy and worthwhile thing, it is sustainable and good for one. While heroin is the opposite, heroin blasts you with its effects then leaves you in ruins.
