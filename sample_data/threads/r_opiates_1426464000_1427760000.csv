My family had a big birthday get together for March, and my brother pulled me into one of my parent's rooms to share with me how scared he is. He told me he started doing IM heroin (accidentally, he was trying IV but didn't know proper administration) around Thanksgiving and very recently was taught how to IV admin properly. He's scared how strong its got hold of him already. He's been all over hard drug game for 15 years and has already shaken an oxy addiction about 10 years ago. He said this is so much stronger. He cried the whole time he was talking with me about it, even wanting me to watch him shoot up. I love my brother and have never judged him. He told me I was the only person he's told. He knows rehab is an option, but is scared of the consequences of admitting an addiction problem to his wife/his career(he has accomplished a lot of success with new position potential)/his prescriptions he's getting now/family implications(our father was recently diagnosed with lung cancer) I know he's reaching out to me for help, but I have no idea what to do. He lost his best friend to this a year ago and several more throughout the years. He knows where this road goes. I know he's been nursing a deep depression and guilt about his best friend and recently has been getting the shake-down from his doctors/pharmacies/insurance company about his prescriptions, so I can totally see how he got here. I told him I love him, and that I'm available to help in any way he wants whether that's talking with his wife about it or helping the family understand rehab (we come from a very protestant family), or anything else he wants. He told me he wants to try a hybrid stepdown /cold turkey approach with some methadone he got from some friends while his wife is gone for a couple days. He knows how dangerous this is. I don't want to push him away at all making him feel betrayed I let his secret out (that's why I'm here I guess), but I know I need help to know how I can help him best.

""Well I could portion it out evenly and that will keep me well til I can reup. That's what I need to do. But you know what? Fuck it! What I'll do is actually do a decent size dose that means something and that I can actually enjoy then tomorrow I'll just do smaller doses. I mean as long as I'm not totally in full blown withdrawals.""

Then you start actually loading your syringe, or lining up what u are gonna rail and there you go again...

""Man fuck this! I Need to get some sleep tonight. Maybe mom will loan me some cash til tomorrow night so I will save a tiny hit for when I first get up then drive to her place get the money and go grab some more dope in the morning.""

Then even more junkie logic creeps in....

K  If she does that and I reup in the morning why not just do all this shit tonight? Then I'll just grab cash from Her and reup first thing when I wake up before I get too sick. And if she doesn't give it to me, fuck it! I'll pawn my phone. 

Then u wake up the next morning wanting to beat the shit out of the junkie asshoke who fucked you over last night.  unfortunately... You're the asshole.

Well there are a lot of new 'street  goons' -as I affectionately call them- working for the crew I pick up from atm... and after working all day this new guy, that doesn't know I'm a regular customer, or he's just kinda douchey can't even tell me ""if it's that loose powder from Saturday the was measured in points or little hard chunks of dope.

""Dude I'm not going to just look at the bags""(this went on back and forth for just a sec, i mean fuck, am I an asshole? GEEZ, he can't look at a bag?)
""Do you want to meet me or not?""
""Ok, yes, but tell me, are the 3 point bags on their own, or do you make them by giving 3 points?, ANNNND is it back to $50 already or $60?""

""50.. 50~!!!""
""Ok ok,-GOOD-can meet you at X"" 
Twenty minutes of standing in the cold later ... car pulls up behind a store near my place ""are you waiting for me?""
""I HOPE SO""
Hop in the back, ask for d , hope it's not loose powder, ...which was OK-ish weeks ago but yesterday I just got FUCKED and it was the worst ever"" 
BAM, biggest(looking) solid, bright white chunk of dope I've seen in a long , long time. Looked like the stuff that once blew me away and got me higher than I've ever been. 

Finally, I break up a 3 point chunk of dope, put 2 points away, mix up a point in my cooker and the liquid looks dark enough, looks like the best yellow - gold colour I'm used to, tastes bitter in just the right way, FEELS just right as it's dropped off in the vein -the one closer to my body- in the crook of my arm and as it's spreads across my body and mind effecting my mood and muscles. The right effects with plenty of the right affect ;) as well. 

Makes 2 nice looking syringes and there's enough for a 60 unit left over syringe after the other two big ones are mixed up. Barley any heat, just a few taps cause I don't want to sit there smashing it up, warm the water more than anything, just enough and then spin it with the cotton and syringe to finish dissolving , big red burst of blood fills half the syringe, push it down gently but rather fast, check it twice to obsessively make sure I'm still registered, make a mental note for the millionth time of how it's *IN*, BUT: there's just a little bit of the needle showing when I'm in the perfect spot. feel it glide into the vein, perfect angle just enough of the needle showing gotta do this one perfectly. BOOM~!! Thank You Jebus! FINALLY, FINALLY. 

I really wish In could have know yesterdays dope was going to fucking blow, obviously I wasn't the only one who wanted to complain about shit dope with oddly enough no price breaks, someone or a number of people obviously did complain and in a crew that serves about 70-150 people/orders a day that's no surprise. 

I really wanted to get more but I can't take a chance as my power will be cut off if I don't pay $60 by the 18th and tho I expect a check if it's late I'll be getting high in the dark with spoiling food while I read books by candle light. Now I just need to make this last three evenings until that check comes. 

I'm so fucking pleased to be getting good dope again, I really was going to justify a break partly based on low quality but it seems I'll be doing that in about 5-7 days after I enjoy the next week and get a little more lope.

Yay. I live outside Vancouver, this isn't supposed to be hard to do. $16 per point, that's $16 a night if I can space it out for 3 nights, this is how it's supposed to be. :)",1426451808.0

They walked right by me and the dog definitely turned to look at me as they passed, but the cop just yanked at him and they kept on walking, I think they were on a mission to get somewhere.. And I'm sure it doesn't hurt that I'm a white kid with glasses that looks like he can fix your computer...

So anyways, lackluster story, I know, but it got me wondering, what's the smallest amount those dogs can detect? I've walked around with 12 grams in my backpack before! Does anyone have any experiences or encounters with one of these ""man's best friend/junkie's worst enemy""?? ",1426603156.0

Im not touching it again, but is there anything similar that isnt so risky?","So I was at my local taco bell in the hood baked off my ass and just waiting on my siracha quesarito when a very genial black fellow asks me to step outside. We talk for a few minutes and he hands me a teeny tiny bag and mentions that he deals. I identify the stuff inside as heroin.

Anyways, that night at home I crunch up the stuff and snort it.

Wow, that was intense. The only drugs ive done are pot, shrooms and acid so this was very new. Just laying there and feeling pains I didnt know existed float off of my body. At the same time, I was terrified feeling so powerfully lazy and I kept getting out music lazily looking for that peak. I looked in the bathroom mirror and my pupils were wide as dinner saucers. I felt such a dirtiness and guilt around doing this and that sort of ruined things, I felt like I was doing something awful because my parents would be so dissapointed had they known.

I panicked the next few days because I was obsessed with the high and really wanted to try it again. OBSESSED and felt like addiction was inevitable. Its been a week since then and im stronger in my resolve not to touch it, but boy is my curiosity piqued! Is there a safer opiate to touch that will be aas nice as heroin?

I've recently tried IV'ing for the first time because smoking that much is costing a fortune, and I've read numerous places that IV gets you more bang for your buck.

However, when I tried it I didn't feel anything. First I shot up a point, then I did another point about 10-15min after. Am I possibly doing it wrong? Or is my tolerance that high that I couldn't feel basically .2 worth (and they were all rock.. which is higher potency than powder.

[EDIT] To explain how i did it:

-boiled water and put about 40-50 units (possibly CC's?) in the spoon. Then with low heat I cooked the mixture and gently mixed it around. 

-Then I added more heat, this time it barely started to boil. I stirred a bit and the liquid separated from black matter.

-I put in a rolled up end of a q-tip, placed syringe on top and sucked it. Then got rid of air bubbles by flicking and then injected slowly. 

-I pulled it a tiny bit and definitely saw blood get sucked up in syringe, then I slowly injected back in. 

I didn't feel anything and that doesn't seem right (i'll definitely feel a little high smoking the same amount [0.2 g] at once.)

Any ideas why I didn't feel anything? Am I doing something wrong? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I think my cat saved my life. I am done.,"Been off subs for a few years now after being on them for five years. I started chipping again a few years ago. Partied hard, all the way to bangkok and cambodia and back to the states. My wife's cousin passed from an overdose 13 days ago. Stopped IV after beating hep C. I am used to going real hard with the snorting, Thailand dope is not that great.  I have really enjoyed coming here over the last year or so. However, what happened is stranger then any dream. Maybe it was a dream. Over the course of the last day I went hard, and was being dumb as I had no tolerance. I came closer to an OD then anywhere else in my life. My ex gf od'd twice on me many years ago. Well, after attending a wake and a funeral and finally being back home, I decided it was finally time to finish off what was left. I also ingested some PST earlier in the day. In BKK when I would go heavy with the snorting it wasn't a big deal, I would just get mildly uncomfortable. Well, this was something else entirely. Too much #4 later and let's just say that I was beyond uncomfortable all the way into the danger zone. 

My cat stayed by my side, he kept pushing my pressure point in my hand and listening to me breathing for almost an hour. He kept listening to my heart beat. I don't usually believe in a higher power except when in an emergency. This is the closest emergency I had experienced personally, and I said if I am OK I will be done with dope for good. I am writing this, it has been an hour or two and I guess that time has come. 

Probably won't be spending too much time on here because of the triggers. My cat was mouth to mouth distance from my face, and may have saved me.  This is stranger than any dream. I never thought you could OD from snorting except the one time my ex gf seized or passed out in front of me before we start booting,  but I came across that line. It was right in front of me, and was right on the edge of the razor. I guess this is a wake up call of sorts. Be safe y'all. I love life too much to leave so soon. I am thinking of making an app that will check in on people and if they stop responding it will text 911, not everyone has a cat that knows CPR and pressure points. 

Being grateful is an understatement. Wish I could post a photo of my face, I have never seen the OH shit face on myself like that. Much love to everyone on here, be safe. For real, you guys are great and it is unfortunately the smartest and most awesome people that seem to perish in this way.

I don't get it. I blog about this shit twice a week and put very graphic pictures into my blog. I was an IV chick, why tf did that foil get me all turned on. Thankfully I had the good sense to get my daughter in the car and gorge on ice cream instead but like I said fuck me sideways...

&nbsp;

I started off my day with a coffee and a 8mg subutex (the round white one with an arrow on the back.) I read online that that you can inject these, some say use a wheel / micron others say just to double filter with some big cotton balls. As a normal person I don't have micron filters laying around so I go with the ladder. So I do just that with half the pill, after injection I instantly feel very anxious and uncomfortable. My left hand goes completely numb / asleep (the injection took place in the crook of the left arm.) While this feeling proceeds to become stronger, my withdraws subside and I simultaneously start to nod and violently puke. The overall feeling was reminiscent of a dirty dxm couch syrup high. 
   
&nbsp;  
  
My breathing becomes more rapid as I start to think I am going to die. In my semi delirious thoughts I put the syringe (with 10 cc left in the barrel out of the 50 that were pre injection) in my pocket thinking if they find me incapacitated or only slightly dead they might be able to identify the substance. It dawns on me it is time to go to work so I hop in the passenger seat of my room mates car. At this point I'm fighting with every shred of survival instinct to stay awake as I keep asking him to pull over so I can vomit again. Now my whole left arm is numb. I've heard the stories of suboxone being injected into arteries that end in amputation so I pull up my sleeve to see if I missed, nothing out of the ordinary other than my vision being exponentially bright and blurry.  
  
&nbsp;  
  
My room mate says I need to go to the e.r. like any self respecting junkie, I refuse. I drop him at work and at this point with my condition worsening I realize he may be right so I drive to the e.r., park the car aaannnnnnnd fall into a deep sleep with the keys in my hand.  
  
&nbsp;  
   
I wake up three hours later to a woman (civilian) taping my window. I have three missed calls from the boss, puke on my work pants (from when I was asleep) but on the bright side im feeling a little better. Moral of the story don't ever try to quit, dope 4 lyfe cuhh but in reality don't shoot pills or suboxone, it's not worth it, take it as prescribed. Also this all taking place after two days of an extremely expensive dope binge prior to three days of extreme depression and suicide plots, you might really feel like you want to die but trust me you probably don't and probably will regret it.  

&nbsp;  
  
Also any ideas as to why this happened? (I feel it may be necessary to point out that, this was not precipitated withdraws I know this because my withdraws were gone instantly after I took the shot (which I took 24 hrs after my last dope shot. Also this was not being really high either, I did a gram of some raw 24-48 hrs prior to taking the sub and new rig, clean spoon, clean cottons, tap water (my city's water is in the news for high concentration of flouride in the water right now but I read up before taking the shot it takes about 10 grams of flouride to overdose.)    

&nbsp;

I would have never imagined that, and I don't know how I feel about it. Which makes me feel terribly guilty and hypocritical because while I don't want to rely on medicine to be pain free I have a dependency on them now.

My dealer called them suboxone, however after some research I found out they are not subs but just 8 mgs of buprenorphine without the naloxone. I have had sub strips/pills in the past but i realize these are different.

I have a habit of around 90 mgs of roxicodone per day on average for the past few years. My preferred method is insufflation.

My questions are:
Can I get high off them?
Can I snort them or is that a waste?
How much would i need to do in order to stop withdrawal?
Do I need to wait until I'm hurting to avoid precip withdrawal?
Whats the high like compared to roxies?
Are these considered better than regular suboxone?

I've been a drug user of one kind or another basically since before puberty, although so far I have pretty much eschewed opiate use out of a combination of limited availability and economic stinginess. About a year ago I started lurking in some DMNs, and then 6 months ago started making purchases. Among my many sampled items, I picked up a 1/4 gram of tar. I smoked it with a few friends one evening, and was overwhelmed with how natural and pleasant the experience was. I found it to be an excellent social lubricant, an empathogen, and even an aphrodisiac. Being slightly numb made it far easier to speak to people, and I made plenty of new friends that night where normally I would've just retreated into myself and spoken to no one. I've smoked more on a few other occasions, and as a general rule I just like myself better on H; I'm less anxious, more friendly, more caring. It seems like opiates cure my natural tendency to be mean and petty with myself and others.

My first choice would be to become a daily user, but unfortunately I can't afford a habit at this point in my life, and I understand that  with constant use many of the positive effects become less pronounced and are replaced with a ""new normal"". My second choice would be to be a long term chipper; I estimate I could afford around 2 opiate experiences per month without putting any kind of financial strain on myself or building a serious tolerance. 

Of course I've heard plenty of horror stories in my time about the ""just once"" crowd who end up destitute and dopesick. My preference would be to avoid a habit that is both unsustainable and uncontrollable, although I'm willing to risk either one of the two in isolation. To this end I've devised a test, and my hope is that you, as the actual opiate users, can tell me how well it models actual opiate use. 


Its my understanding that nicotine is similarly addictive to opiates. I'm not currently addicted to either, and I'd like to ""test run"" my ability to withstand the lure of opiates by seeing if I can maintain a fairly conservative schedule for consuming nicotine. I've recently started vaporizing nicotine using a PV (electronic cigarette), and have built a vaping routine which limits my nicotine consumption to twice a month, or once every two weeks. On every first and third Friday of the month I allow myself to vape as much nicotine as I want, while every other day of the week I vape 0mg liquid. So far its been difficult, but it looks like it might be possible to maintain. Obviously I would follow this schedule for at least 3 - 6 months before starting on opiates to make certain that it is truly sustainable. If I can maintain this routine, does this suggest that I could maintain a similar bi-weekly heroin habit, or are there factors I'm not accounting for? 

For reference, my plan would be to only buy DNM #3 heroin and dissolve it an e-liquid to vape in my PV. This would prevent me from switching to a more addictive delivery mechanism, as the tinctures I make are too fluid to be insufflated and too gelatinous to be shot. I'm also totally in love with making psychoactive infused e-liquids :)

I assume that some members of this forum are smokers/vapers as well as opiate users, and I'd like to hear them compare the relative addictive properties of nicotine and smoked/vaped heroin. I'd also like to hear from the mass median of the community about any perks or disadvantages of opiate use that I might not have encountered yet, having only had ~10 opiate experiences (and that includes a few adolescent experiences with codeine and stolen Vicodins).

I don't want it. I just want another hit. 
So what do I do? Run away? Go to rehab? Wait months, maybe a year until I can get a needle in my arm again?

I honestly cannot believe it's possible. The reason it happened and that they were so sympathetic is partly personal, and partly related to a [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2ywl5t/in_the_hospital/) which I accidentally posted on my school throwaway.

So, since receiving the bad news about evolution today, I was thinking I may try to look into the RC (research chemical; usually analogues of existing prescription drugs) opiates. I know that RC opiates have always been pretty scare relative to stims and benzo RCs, but I have been looking on researchchemsusa and have heard mostly about butyr fentanyl, acetyl fentanyl (which I guess is china white / synthetic heroin), MT-45, AH-7972; not sure if I got the number right on that last one. 

Anyway, I feel like I see very little discussion of opiate RCs on here, at least lately, so I was wondering if any of you have had success or really enjoy any of them. I am honestly scared of the fentanyl analogues but I'm sure if I used my sensitive scale and played extra careful, that combined with my tolerance would make it completely safe to test. I also wanted to ask you guys instead of ChemsRUs since you guys actually know opiates and I can get expert opinions!

So I'm wondering: please share any opiate RCs you've experienced, and if any are worth testing out or maybe even PM if you have a place you like to source (please just let me know if saying that isn't allowed and I will edit that out). Just to give you an idea, I was up to ~90mg oxy per day, and am now mostly using suboxone (~4mg per day, trying to taper down and reduce tolerance). I have tried kratom, which isn't really a research chemical but is probably the most popular legal opioid. I think it's better than nothing, especially when you get good strains from top notch vendors, but I'm looking for something more like a real opiate feel (ROA oral or insufflation).

Thanks in advance, and hopefully people can post experiences and info here so we start to build up an idea of how this community as a whole views the current opiate RCs and if they're worth dabbling in or trying, even once. I hope to hear from people and everyone have a great afternoon / night, and I hope you're all feeling as good as me right now :)",1426708732.0

My level of empathy has hit zero, I'm unable to feel any emotion at this point, Her distorted face has slowed to a blur. Her anger  seems so irrational compared to my cold miserable reason.
""I don't want to do what you want me to do, you might think I'm helping myself, but for all intents and purposes I'm doing you a favour. You don't get somebody to do you a favour by yelling at them everyday at 9am.""  
  I'm ridiculing her. Both out loud and in my head. Where did she learn to build rapport? The CIA? Guantanamo? What's next she's going to start blaring Barney at 5am over the non-existent loud speakers?
She storms out. Slamming the door. ""You lazy fucking bastard.""  

  I'm not in a good mood. My homeostasis of self destructive compulsions is totally out of balance. I've spent the last 2 nights, going from about £150 of winnings to losing £300 playing online poker. I'm pretty sure at this point I'm just an idiot. But the reason I started losing is because I was playing out of boredom. I had paused when stealing my girlfriend's grandma's painkillers. Codeine, sat in a drawer, I paused, thought she might notice and I put it back. If I'd have stolen it I wouldn't have been playing two nights ago. And If I hadn't been playing two nights ago I wouldn't have been playing last night. Not that there wasn't a point last night where I wasn't up. But I couldn't stop. Maybe I wanted to lose. I hope I didn't want to lose, but now in the light of day I couldn't be sure.  

  My girlfriend calls me. She's unaware of this of course. I remember sobbing last night. I tell her about this morning's interaction with my mother. She seems angrier than me about this interaction. I mention that I'm a little switched off emotionally. She asks me not to hang myself from the shower curtain. We don't have a shower curtain so I said I wouldn't hang myself from the bars at the end of the bed. I finally decide to leave the house.  

  It takes me a minute to register that I'm singing along with the radio. The voice a distant echo of my own. Driving home from Sarah's, the codeine snugly in my coat pocket. The day has been spent in a constant flux between numbness and emotional breakdown. Before she goes to bed I write a promise to her that I won't kill myself. Her life, her emotional state, her mental health are about the same as mine. Sometimes I worry she's going to kill herself. I keep thinking we're both doomed. I take 180mg of codeine and wait for the warmth to wash over me.

christ the hotel is so cold, my sweat stinks and while i am not HIGH i feel as though i can nod out in the conference center when i need to pay attention and figure out where i am supposed to go.  i am an adult goddamnit and i need some coffee and maybe this pill to calm down and focus on this crazy assfuck convention.  

the worst part is i am in vegas.  my prescription pill bottle holds many pills &amp; i pray the TSA folks don't scrutinize for they are different sizes, shapes and colors.  so i snort two 30's and wander off to meet the coworkers for our dinner presentation.  wow i am talkative and happy unlike at work where i sulk and clock watch.  

but after our presentation i hide in my room.  the sheets are like ice and my body aches and cries for more oxy.  C'MON!  anything less than 100mg is bullshit!  MORE motherfucker! it screams.  but i don't.  i NEED to be high on the plane.  that 4 hour jaunt is HELL if you are going through WDs.  

the bitch with a healthy H addiction and a career that requires travel is you must scramble for pills for holding H through TSA with your boss is not happening.  so oxy please.  but shit oxy never feels as gentle...    

fucking vegas.  gambling?  no problem here chief.  but the 4 hour plane ride away from my hidey hole where i keep my drugs..?  now THAT is uncomfortable...

i die and wither but i get on that plane.  i eat the last of my stash with some crappy overpriced airport fast food.  i want to rail it but lack the tools.  i stare at the heads in my plane row.  men of industry.  men with a mission.  men with a plan.  my plan is to get home and reunite with some H.

i feel less than human in the plane.  these men shoulder burdens and raise themselves to feed families and better their lot while i can barely stand being in this flying tube because all i crave in life is the poppy.  

the guy next to me chit chats.  i am high enough to be civil but when he asks me What I do?- i avoid the question.  i know if i tell the truth i have to talk about work.  and if he has a background in aeronautics or engineering it will get technical.  it's hard enough pretending to give 2 fucks for a paycheck but blowing smoke out my ass on a plane to some fuck while dreaming of that fat shot in my condo...?  

i am between jobs.  leave me alone.

unemployed people are not worth talking to on airplanes.  they can sit there gritting their teeth as the last of their stash barely warms their veins.  no one cares.  

let me hold on to my sanity way up here 40,000 feet above the earth and may the gap in the space time continuum between this seat and my nodding chair at home be merciful and quick.  fuck Euclidean space.  real time is for suckers.

It was rude of me, but also somewhat taken out of context. I will admit that I was a wreck that day and have been for a week. And this is my story of why.

So I've been battling with addiction for 2 years. Oxycodone has absolutely torn my life apart. Started as something I thought was just fun, much like drinking with buddies. Little did I know that it would take away everything I love. I have lost all of my belongings besides my truck. Everyone besides dboy and other junkies hate me. I've stolen a lot of shit for money. Just pretty much became drug addicted scum. 

Well my girlfriend was caught stealing from her boss in January. She had stolen around 5-15 grand in cash and various valuables. My parents found out of course. We couldn't keep it a secret in the even lt that she ends up in jail. Luckily she has not had any charges pressed up to this point, and we feel that she might not. 

Over the course of the past year she has stolen from her parents, her boss, then to top it off we were hitting licks on speed junkies. We had been pieces of shit. In the midst of all this, we have given up our future and home, and subsequently moved back in with my parents. 
In the past year my mom had lost a 2k at walmart, and my sister lost $500. Well the other night my mom sat me and my girlfriend down and let us know that she had $900 but now only has $700, and the money was in a secret pocket in her purse the entire time. I myself have never stolen anything. I've only never stopped my girlfriend from doing so therefore I'm guilty by association. But I remember my girl stealing money. She would always take just enough to buy Blues, but never take a noticeable amount, or Atleast not noticeable til a later date. So basically as yall can tell, my family has accused my girlfriend of stealing $4000 from them over the year and kicked her out in the process. There's no proof but all signs point to my girl. I've been very hurt that she may have stolen from my family behind my back. It would have been different if she had told me. So yeah I have been very hurt and it has made me hateful.
To top everything off, one of my bestfriends put together a beer league softball team with my other bestfriends and guys I went to school with. My buddy that I work with came into work yesterday and told me that everyone talked shit about me and my girl after their game including my brother. They all talked about what apiece of shit I am. 

The worst part is I have been maintaining sobriety since January. And shit like this makes it hard to stay clean. 

I don't know sorry for the rambling. Just thought I would share why I haven't been nice lately.

I want to do this as soon as I wake up tomorrow. My tolerance level comes from sniffing half a cap of ECP every hour or two. I go through about 4 or 5 caps a day. So how much should I plug my 1st time? I have to wake up at 4:30 to be at work by 6 and I want to feel like I just snorted 1.5-2 caps. I'm running low on ECP which is why I wanna plug. 

2. Procedure wise, this is what I've learned, tell me if this is correct: mix X amount of ECP with water in a syringe (which I know nothing about by the way), remove needle, insert the end of the syringe about an inch into the anus, push plunger, keep syringe in for 5min to make sure none comes out when you remove it, remove syringe, get high. Sound right? There's nothing with cooking/ heating right? And nothing with filtering or cotton?

3. Is the bioavailability of heroin rectally the same as it is through IV? Does anyone have any numbers for every ROA actually?

4. I do not own a syringe, nor do I have the money for one, nor do I have the time to get one tonight, nor do I want one in my house. This leads me to my main question (besides getting the dosage right): WHAT CAN I USE BESIDES A SYRINGE TO GET HEROIN IN MY BUTT? I have one of these little syringe looking things the dentist gave my bro, it has a plunger and a curved ""needle"" (a relatively thick plastic tube) to forcefully squirt water in your gum hole when you get a tooth pulled.

Short question: If I go to a doctor in Florida (Am from California) and try to get pain medication for a pre-existing injury...Will the doctor 
A) contact my primary care physician  
or
B) Be able to look up my prescription history?

I have several herniated disks in my back but in California it's rare to find a doctor who will prescribe without having surgery or anything broken. The one I did have retired and now instead I get shitty Advil patches. Normally the pain isn't to severe so oh well. Out here in Florida on vacation; went messing around with younger kids and got mangled coming down the stretch to turn 1 Go-Karting. my back and neck are seriously fucked. I have heard Florida is a little more relaxed, so I have been thinking of finding a local DR. and saying I forgot my meds at home (Which haven't been prescribed in over a year) Or that my luggage was lost with my prescription inside and I need a bridge to get me through the vacation. Can they look up my medical records in California to verify that I ""currently getting prescribed"". I feel like they would easily be able to ask for a pharmacy number to call to verify that is the case. Could I say its a new injury and maybe get away with some pain meds without going through the MRI and Xray process again? 

any helpful Hints?

It just so happens that he hurt his back doing some yard work for a friend.  He went to the doctor and it turns out he has 3 bulging discs and he is in some pain.  Its very much a legit case.  He went to the doctor today and they gave him muscle relaxers, but no pain pills.  They told him they can't do that on the first visit.  He has a follow up visit this Monday.  The problem is, he smokes a lot of pot.  He is worried that if he pees dirty, he won't be able to get pills...So he is thinking about using the fake pee.  He has had success with it in the past.  I guess my question is a couple parts....If he uses the fake pee, do they test for the muscle relaxers?  If they do and they don't show up on the test, what happens?  Should he even worry about the fake pee and just take the test?  Will the pot stop him from getting the pain pills?  He isn't very internet savy so I told him I would try and find out some info for him.  Any help at all would be appreciated.

(nothing interesting, just some thoughts)","Hey everyone, I'm new here. I'm just a 19 year old dude from Australia. I've been injecting Heroin every day for a year. I don't know what the purpose of this post is, but I feel a little lost and depressed.

For a long time I've been taking drugs, however I've been really strict with my usage, like taking MDMA every 2 months etc.

But that all change when I started shooting Heroin. See, I use to take Oxycodone every few weekends to chill out, but they got way too expensive and they got this new formula bullshit now.

Anyway, I feel in love with Heroin. And you know what? I don't want to stop. I don't want to feel 'normal'. I want to feel happy and euphoric. I never got that in my life. I've always been a smart kid with decent friends, except still I felt like life was such a burden. I love my family more than anything in the world, and if it wasn't for them - or my pets, I'd probably rather die.

Nothing really interests me, I've always been a boring person. Well, not at parties, at social gatherings I'm the life of the party. I'm not too crazy or a douche, I just love making people laugh. I love making people feel special. I love making people happy. Maybe because I never am. This has nothing to do with my upbringing, so I feel kind of guilty about feeling this way.

But how long can I inject heroin into my veins before my body starts to wither?

How can I travel the world if I can't even go a week without heroin?

I've currently gone 2 days without heroin, and I'm about to go through 2 more excruciating days without it. It sucks. I can't even do my homework. The darkness I felt as a child is back. Heroin is a demon, but I'd rather the demon that shows me a little pleasure than merely experiencing the absense of light...the absence of life. Heroin takes a way the morbid from reality. I live a lonely life now, after graduating high school I realised I have nobody. 

I don't know what I'm getting at. I don't even know you guys very well, I just hope everyone stays safe and looks out for each other.

I have been in a toxic relationship for the past five years and it's mostly due to drug use. My ""fiance"" (which she only calls herself when she feels like it even though I've popped the question with a ring she never wears) and I are both addicted to opiates. Her percs and me to heroin. She used to be both physically and mentally abusive now it's mostly mental and nine times out of ten only when she is high. I am still very much in love with her but when she says some of the things she does to me and puts me so far down, I can't help but wonder why am I still so good to her..we are lesbian btw. We have had to live with my grandmother about 35 minutes outside of Columbus which is where our lives are, it's our hometown. I haven't been able to get a job because my car is too old and shitty to make the long commute everyday and the jobs where we are in Lancaster are far from decent. I need to get a job I know that but I have one lined up, a great job lined up, whenever I can get back to Columbus to live. Other than that though, I cater to this woman unlike anyone I have ever seen cater to a person. She is a stripper and I trust her enough to not care at all. I have cheated on her during the beginning of our relationship and she has cheated on me as well so of course that makes things very hard on our relationship but we both forgave each other, although she has a problem not bringing it up every time she's angry about the slightest thing, and making it seem as if she's still a perfect angel. I did my fair share of dirt but it was when I was a different person, EXTREMELY fucked off on opiates and xanax (30mgs+ a day of xanax and 300mgs+ of oxycodone), xanax like it does to everyone after some time, made me a monster. I have yet to truly forgive myself for the person I was almost two years ago. Anyway, I keep telling myself once we get our own place again, seeing as we haven't been able to afford one the last few months due to the drug use. We had always lived on our own before, so that too, not having our own place and space, has made things very difficult. I guess what I'm asking for is some advice...
Am I wasting my time, is she wasting hers?
With such a terrible past, is there any going back?
There are so many times where I want to leave her and never look back, but then the sun rises again and it's as if nothing ever happened. What am I doing, and why am I doing it? 
I know love is supposed to hurt like he'll, but..should it ever make you feel like dying would be easier than living one more day..?

the white guys that sold drugs here always say they are Connected.  this may or may not be true but you heard enough stories to keep the rumors exciting...Jason claimed this.  he sold dimes of weed but could also get you x, coke and H.  

my girlfriend Molly came from a good home.  2 parents, 2 kids, a dog and a cat.  the city showed her how different things are on the other side of the bay.  the whole princess in distress was her angle.  she played coy but nothing made her more excited than watching me fight.  like some dumb purple assed baboon, i happily embraced this role for i enjoyed violence and pleasing my female.  Molly was my all...but after the broken noses, busted knuckles and ribs- dope took my place.  

i tried to hide my habit.  i had academic responsibilities.  scholarships are demanding.  so i shot in my foot but after meeting Jason -Molly went 100% junkie.  stole money from parents, sold family jewelry and cigarette smoke swirled like a python over the swarms of red pin pricks on her pale arms.  Jason was her new pet.  i said nothing because we were so fucking high all the time.  Molly's money plunged us deep into the rabbit hole.

i was losing my woman to this pseudo mafia guido douchebag (half jewish and irish) but i no longer cared.  I was under the spell too.  no not Jason, nor his gun or silly Soprano tales but the rituals of dope.  melting heaven in a spoon and watching your blood enter the chamber a heartbeat before you plunge the flower into your vein...Molly and i were changed.

we had WDs in a February freeze and miserably rode the bus downtown to Jason's dealer.  i had to wait outside so i went around back and lit a cigarette.  i tossed the match and the smoke trail arced into a puddle where it hissed, sputtered and died.  i couldn't help but notice a pair of legs wearing jeans, white socks and shiny new Reeboks stuck straight out of the dumpster.  i started to walk forward to see why these legs pointed up towards a clear blue sky but stopped.  this was death.  

Jason, the dealer, Molly and 2 junkies all stood around me staring at the feet.  one guy looked in the dumpster and said it was some black guy.  and that was that.  we went inside and got high.  inside was warm.  there was video games and a kitten.  it smelled like ganja and cinnamon toast.  i nodded out.  

an hour later i had to leave for class.  Molly and i had economic theory all the way across campus so we would be late.  Molly shrugged and said she was staying so i stumbled down the stairs alone.  i walked past the feet.  someone had stolen the shoes.  

in my dorm i took off my shoes to inject the vein that slides right below my toes.  i stared at my shoes.  fuck it.  its winter.  i shot it into my arm and put on a sweater.",1426921570.0

I really, really wanted to. But, they talked me out of it, and I settled for kratom instead. I started slow with the kratom, and then in the past few months starting using daily. I was going to post this on the same account, but I couldn't find it and don't remember the details.
  
  
After many months of daily kratom use, I decided I wanted to try a real opiate (stupid I know). Ended up getting 0.125g of bone white #4 heroin pebbles, which I believe were very pure. I had no idea what my tolerance was, so I started small  (~5mg) and built myself up. Also I guess I should mention I was crushing the pebbles and snorting it. After about 6 hours, I had consumed the entire thing, which I did not intend to do.  I feel as if I was chasing a high that I just wasn't getting - I never got high like people describe a heroin high to be. It was very ""heavy"" and ""intoxicating"". I was mostly just very sleepy and very very itchy, and felt kind of like being drunk but also happier than usual and sedated.
   
  
So, yeah. I kind of want to wait 3 weeks and then try again for a better high, but at the same time I don't want to fuck up my life. I suppose I could walk away, but I feel as if I still need to know what the hype is about, I want feel what nodding out feels like. I mean I've already done so much stupid shit, what's 1 more? But for now, any kratom, opioid residue, or anything intoxicating I had has been flushed.

My reason for posting is I had a moment tonight I thought worth sharing. Managed to scheme up 2gs of ECP and a half G of some soft. Doesn't happen often I mix the two but it just happened to be in the cards tonight.. so we progress. Starting with the soft IV and mixed in a little brown here and there for S's and G's. Feeling good, usual splurge high, melting in the couch despite the upper and made the switch to some bigger shots of that dirty. Managed to kill the gram of brown and half G of soft in about 4 hours. Life is good. Put my shit away and figured I'd pick up my usual shananigans in the morning. Well one episode of cops goes by.... fuck it lets tap into that other bag of goodness. Its good to get nice and fucked up every now and again instead of just maintaining most days. I mean fuck.. its Friday. So I whip up a doozy of a shot, bang it, loving it. starting to nod out on the toilet. Yeah, that felt fucking perfect, lets do another little guy to put me right where I want to be. Now we all have our little routines through this process and after I sink the plunger I fill the rig back up with water to clean it and squirt it in my mouth. Now before everybody shits on my routine I have to add I have no rational reasoning for doing shit this way. I don't think I'm getting any left over dope or whatever I simply do it cause... I fucking do, rather than squirt the floor, I squirt my mouth. So I fill up that next shit and things slooooooowly go black... nodded out. I come back to and forget where I am in my process. So I squirt my dope filled rig in my mouth, realize it doesn't taste like water, fuuuuuuck I just drank my shot. In hind sight, probably for the better. After a long nod is not usually the best time to take your next shot. So I feel fucked up, and slightly dissapointed in myself for wasting a shot.

I have been on 60mg diazepam a day for the last 12 months. Well my family found out how bad my habit really was and how I was taking multiple pills at a time to an amount over my prescribed dosages. They basically said, hand over the pill bottles and go to rehab or you are moving out. Well now I am doing a cold turkey w/d from all the valium and doing a moderate coke habit withdrawal as well at once which blows (haha blow... get it...) and going to an intensive outpatient rehab facility. The withdrawals are fucking killing me especially the benzo w'ds. On top of my anxiety and panic disorder I have, i have Restless leg, 30hr+ insomnia, 4x a day panic attacks, and a whole lot of other bull shit. They will refuse to take me to a detox facility and I can't check in myself. They say ""get over it"". Please help me I have no idea what to fucking do. I cant take this shit any longer man.

update: I called up a friend and he brought over 9 klonopin. I took 3mgs a few hours ago and things are OK for now. I am going to have to show up at my psychiatrist tomorrow and have him explain how serious it is to my parents. If he isnt available or my family are going to be adamant as hell I guess I will have to admit myself into the emergency room.

my life was okay. i had a decent job that id held for almost a year, a record for me, and a somewhat comfortable place to live if entirely annoying but whatever, i had a roof and food even if i had to share it with a histronic hamplanet, her three kids and her three shitty dogs. i guess i was feeling like a badass like ic ould handle all of the shit life was throwing at me because i decided to borrow my friends car on 24 hours of no sleeping and half a bottle of tequila and drive three hours to cop some fire ecp. made it there fine, hung out all night drinking with some college bros, tried to sleep on one of my buddies' couch but couldn't get to sleep, so went to drive back to my job the next morning. well, two hours later i wake up with the car hitting a guardrail and bouncing back onto the highway. the bottom was so rusty it just tore right out of the car. some good samaritans helped me move it out of traffic since it obviously wasnt running ever again. quickly i stuff all my dirty rigs into a sock and pitch it along with my scales over the side of the embankment. well, one of the guys saw me pitch something. the police show up and im thinking i can talk my way out of this like usual. well the cops in this state aren't having any of it. he finds the sock with the rigs which i deny are mine, plausibly at this point. i have the dope safely hidden on my person. so i consent to let him search my bag. oops, i'm high. i forgot there was a tiny bag of another brand of dope in my bookbag. well, now i'm arrested and fucked. still have the bulk of the dope on me. make it to the jail with all the dope. get into the holding cell. do a bunch of lines of heroin because thats a great fucking idea. pass out in the holding cell with it in the palm of my hand. now i''m looking at two felonies and five misdemeanors. 

fast forward a miserable month and a half. my best friends have been feeding me money and books while i was in jail in shitkicker county. finally make it to court, plead guilty in exchange for five years probation. get released. call all my college bros. aren't my bros anymore apparently. kind dude i helped out with a few phone calls and some food while he was locked up lets me stay at his house for three days and recuperate while i wait to pick up 14gs of dope on front from a mexican/guatemalan gang i hooked up with while i was locked up. (recuperate because the conditions in the jail fucked up a disease i have and they weren't really feeling like treating it.) so he carts me around to probation appointments and feeds me and takes me to pick up a bunch of fucking heroin while hes trying to get clean and doesnt even break down. 

after bus after bus being cancelled i finally make it back to town. sell off enough dope to pay back guatemexicans, shitty dope, don't plan on reupping because i don't want that attached to my name. do the other 10 grams. and here i am.

i have about three friends left. my godmother isnt speaking to me, one of my best friends is about tired of my shit, and i know my other friend who im currently living on his couch doesnt fucking want me here but hed never say that. he already sent me money and books when i was locked up. i have no job. i have no job on the horizon. im a fucking burden on everyone i know, and my other friends are tired of hearing me fucking whine about how much everything sucks but its so goddamn fucking lonely. my cat just pissed all over my best friends 150 dollar shoes and a large amount of his clothes. i really wish i had the courage to just die because im not worth shit to anyone. my parents cant stop drinking long enough to give a shit as to whether im alive or not, but thats no different than it ever has been. i wish i had someone to hold onto me and tell me its going to be okay, but i've made sure that wont happen by being a prickly asshole and because its hard to let people touch me. but its not going to be okay, not now and not for a while. i dont know what im going for here, i dont need anyone to tell me not to kill myself because i dont have the fucking balls. i cant even show my face at my church. i barely even have music to fall back on at this point. i cant run away because ill end up in prison if i do that. i fucked up bad and i dont think i can pull, charm or bullshit my way out of it this time, all my social currency is used up. thats all i guess.",1426895994.0

I'm just bored and trying to pass some time at work by posting a little about this particular experience I'm having switching from dope back to subs.  

So yesterday I waited about 15 hours since my last shot of dope(been almost three months since I really took any sub) and took a small amount,  maybe 1mg, sublingual. It didn't do much at all.  I Took more and felt somewhere in between precipitated wd's and no wd's.  It was odd.  I had lots of the bad symptoms but I was able to sit fairly still.  So I made it through work and drove home as fast as I could. Everything felt cold as hell.  I slept in sweat pants and a hoodie with the heat cranking.  I was able to get some sleep but it was in hour bursts here and there with lots of time rolling and tossing and turning in between.  I had to leave the bed my fiancee and I share and sleep in the guest bedroom because I was afraid my tossing and turning would bother her.  

So I get through the night by taking a couple of 1mg doses to make sleep possible.  By morning my legs just won't let me sleep any more and I have to get up and prepare for work anyway.  By now it's been about 36 hours since my last shot of dope and I figure I can dose sub safely without feeling weird. Well it doesn't work quite like that actually. I take a 2mg chunk and still feel weird temperature fluctuations but overall I feel better than I would if were cold turkey detoxing.  

So that brings me to now.... I am going on 48 hours without any dope. Still feel half shitty, half ok. I'm able to sit pretty still but I have very little motivation.  It would be really easy to stop by the atm and get $40 and go cop enough bags to feel better, but I really want this change. I just can't decide if I'm going to continue sub maintenance or just try to do a short taper.  

If anyone reads this, thanks. Getting off dope sucks but is doable.

Edit: another weird thing that's going on, is that I'm unable to smoke cigs. The taste nasty and make me anxious as fuck. Weird. It'll be good to quit those too..",1426874328.0

I would have walked out the door if they were as crazy and draconian as some people's are (at least from what I've heard here). I made the decision because I'm obviously not ready to stop using completely and be abstinent, but shooting speedballs was going to end up with me dead or in a psych ward. My doc is  pretty hip on the less is more (instead of blindly putting me on 16-32mg) still trying to find the right dose but it seems that 4mg at night and 2mg in the morning is what I'm going to be on. He's the only doctor I've been to who knows that the naloxone is ineffective, the only reason I'm on the generic 2/.05's is insurance. It's such a huge weight off my chest being on maintenance, even though the medicine bugs me out in terms of negative side-effects (especially the unknown ones), it can't be worse than shooting street drugs if I take it as directed. Pot is acceptable, which was also a requirement I had of getting on subs, I was going to keep looking until I found one who was cool with me smoking herb makes the weird feeling I usually get on subs go away.



I am trying to not shoot coke either, so far so good on that front, but an order of 5g a-php came in yesterday. The weird thing is that I ordered it the beginning of February, and the tracking said it had been delivered already, I thought for sure someone stole it, that or I was going to get a letter in the mail from customs. First thought = fuck this I should throw it out; second thought= might as well try it, I think that bodega sells meth pipes anyway. Anyway, I guess after shooting really good coke I don't find the rush of the a-phP mindblowing, it does get me cracked the fuck out though and it has the moreishness of shooting coke. So I need to flush this shit.... After another hit....",1426998369.0

I've done some research and I know that oxycontin is the extended release and that is the main difference. I'm just not sure which ones to do first. I don't know if oxycontin is better or worse to do first. Frankly I'm more inclined to do the oxycodone because I don't really want to be high for 12 hours or have the possibility.

James was the worst.  he lost his job, dropped out of school and made it through this month's rent, utilities and drug expenses by selling his surfboards.  next he was going to sell his hunting gear.  i snorted the 2 bumps, exhaled through my mouth and let the pleasure wash over me slowly like a slug licking my brain.  he shook his head in disgust as he shot up.  he was there for one second staring at me, then his eyes rolled up and he sank into the couch with a sigh.  i pulled the needle out of his arm and set it on the coffee table.

Cassy moved in when he nodded out and went though his pockets.  ""Fucker"", she muttered, ""He sold my fucking books and only gave me 2 points!""

""Two?"", drawled Tony who was my fucking rock in this science experiment, ""he's holding out.""

Tony was like me and snorted.  we both refused the needle unlike fucking Sid and Nancy.  they got rigs from Cassy's medical supplies closet at school and mainlined to get the most out of their stash.  but James always got the lion's share and Cassy went psycho bitch crazy on all of us when she would WD.  i had a black eye from a beer bottle and Tony had half of a laptop.  the other half was in the creek out back.  their crazy behavior was like a burning brand in the dark night sky warning us - Do Not Inject.

but like watching 2 people fuck, we stared all sweaty and freaky when they fixed shots.  the ritual of dope preparation is like a magical spell.  lights are dimmed, candles are lit, blood is taken.  but Structural Mechanics is hard enough to pass with a 100% capacity brain so Tony and I held back.

it was pills that brought us here.  funny we both said Naw to binge drinking.  marijuana was OK but not to the Bob Marley poster and t-shirt level you see in the dorms.  my mom was a pill addict so this was as normal as Budweiser beer cans to me.  Tony had Adderall and i had Oxy.  pushed together in a Computational Geometry class we traded the pills but found mixed together was even better.  party ass James (my dormmate) introduced heroin to the party.  at first we were like Nope.  but Tony snorted it back then like i snorted Oxy...so i tried it.  

now was the bleak time.  Fall session was ending and the Holidays were upon us.  all of us were pale and at least 15lbs lighter.  like vampires we barely crawled out in the day.  James brought us H.  it was taxed and we knew it but you gave him money and he came back with the magic that let your muscles unclench, the snot to stop flowing and peace and sanity kissed you awake and you became alive...Tony and I passed this semester high as birds in the Autumn sky.  without bumps we would never had made it to class.  but H and Adderall let us get in there, dissertate some astronomy and physics and academic reputations were saved.

i never went home.  i didn't have much of a home to return to but Tony did.  his parents stuck his ass in rehab.  i stayed with Sid and Nancy and got crazy.  James ended up in jail, i got a blood infection and Cassy ran off with a dope dealer named Sal.  Cassy made out the best.  

like James, i ended up selling my shit to buy dope and started mainlining it to get higher.  when we got kicked out of our place James became a beggar downtown with his new street girlfriend.  i think they ended up riding trains around CA and OR.  but James was gone.  not sure he was ever there for his spirit was always so fleeting.  

Cassy and her dealer boyfriend Sal became born again Christians.  i saw them a few times at the mall handing out flyers.  her eyes on Christ were just as crazy as her eyes on dope so i think Cassy wins this tournament of fools.  ",1426993571.0

Edit: referring to heroin #4 for those few not familiar with terminology, I think I've heard that in general it's better to smoke #3 or BTH than #4 anyway, but all I know is vaporizing #4 gets me insanely high, coupled with insufflating provides ultimate quick-hit rush with long-lasting effects from snorting",1426989293.0

However, I know some people who have little to no response to opiates, likely because of under secretion of CYP enzymes in the liver. What do you think about the suggestion that opiate addicts generally have higher than average CYP activity, leading to more efficient use of opiates by the body, and thus a higher feel good response?  Compared to people who report minimal opiate response, I bet there would be a difference. Now, its possible opiate use could cause upregulation of those very same enzymes, in which case that's a whole different animal.

I mean that sincerely and hope you see this post. My life hasn't been going all that swimmingly recently and your kind act brightened my day immensely.

On a side note, I first joined this community over three years ago under a different username. I was at a very low point in my life at the time and had just joined reddit. I'd always heard there was a subreddit for everything so naturally as a junkie, I went to r/heroin and was redirected to r/opiates. Here I found a community of people I can relate to. Being an addict is a lonely life. You can't really trust other users and non-users don't trust you, so it's so easy to become isolated from the rest of the world. Additionally, many of us hide our addiction from our friends, family, co-workers and loved ones.

It was here that I found compassion, advice and acceptance in spite all my flaws and addiction. It's easy for non-users to forget that we're people too; Hurt and broken at times, but people too. I've lost many, many things to my addiction but I've tried never to lose my sense of humor or more importantly my humanity. So I try to help others in this community in whatever small way I can, because this sub has helped me so much. And there are a lot of helpful and knowledgeable people in this sub.

You chose to remain anonymous with your gold so I'm not sure if you're a regular here, lurker, or just a non-user curious about the community. Whichever the case may be, I thank you and hope you stick around.

On a final note, I know there are tons of lurkers out there that never comment or post. I encourage you to participate, as that is what makes a community. From my experience here, you'll find acceptance because we can all relate to each other's trials and tribulations; we are all people too.",1426968897.0

1) Is there a difference in effect between smoking, snorting, and injecting heroin? If so, which one has the most brutal WD?

2) During a WD, are there any commin effects regarding behaviour?

3) Are there any common cravings during a high and during a WD, not counting the drug itself of course?

4) Are there any opiates that give a similar rush and high that could be confused to a heroin high?

5) If you have been arrested, is there anything you feel you might need extra care with? What I mean by this is stuff like more frequent toilet visits, some extra sized portions of food, etc?

""Wake up sunshine"", said Jason my roommate.  

Tap.  Tap.  Window.  I opened my eyes.  The world was bright and smeared.  I was sitting upright and my arm...it was bleeding where I shot up.  I licked the blood and opened the driver window.  It was misting gently on a Sunday morning.  I must have nodded out.  next to me was my kit bag of syringes, spoons, lighters and bags.

""I need the car beautiful."", smiled Jason as he leaned on my girlfriend's car and smoked a cigarette.  ""Ho!  Great fucking spot!""

In the Mission there is no parking.  Yet at 3am I found a primo spot.  And then I must have passed out.

""Go see Kym."", said Jason, ""I'll be back in an hour.  You want some lunch?""

""Naw.""  

I grabbed my stuff and crawled out.  Before I could walk away Jason explained how he was gonna score.  Oh and can he borrow 2 points?  If not a bump or a pill?  How about a smoke too?  I climbed up our stairs 1 cigarette, 1 coke bump and 1 point lighter.  Fucking Jason.

""That fucker stole from us!  Where is my car?!  What happened to you last night?!"", shrieked Kym.  

Thank god I did a bump with Jason.

Inside I learned about Jason-the sneaky weasel fuck.  My Playstation was gone.  Kym had no idea but I did.  Jason operates at night like a vampire because he no longer pretended he was a student like us.  He slept all day and crawled out at night.  There was a note.  It said:

You owe me $36 for bar tabs and coke.  I am OK with this!  I took your ps and turned it into $180.  You will get this sweet cash and 4 points from the Land of Nod.  Ask me how when I come back tonight!  Love, Jason.

Fucker.  He had stolen shit before but usually it was the neighbors.  I was so tired of this.  He went in too deep and his charisma barely kept him in good graces.  later he might return with H and maybe even a Playstation he stole from someone else.  but it was getting old.  now I awkwardly explained to my girlfriend why i let this junkie asshole borrow her car.  I knew he drove across the bay and sold drugs to his little brother's friends who were all rich kids and flush with dad's cash.  He would probably do OK...but when Kym hurled the chopping mirror at my head I knew the explanation was weak. 

I was pulling mirror shards out of my face when Kym broke down.  she wanted out of here.  I could see her point.  A guy was shot downstairs over a weed deal.  The neighbors across the street were crazy bikers that said they were going to burn our place down for listening to hip hop.  the Mexican bar on the ground floor was LOUD all fucking night and it was hard to get into the building gate past all the piss, degenerates and crazy drunk Mexicans outside.  but it was home.

i soothed Kym.  all is well.  she started to make waffles as I laid out some bumps for us.  coke, H, coke, H.  wake up, relax.  wake up, relax.  love, love, love, love.

""C'mon babe"", I called impatiently when all of a sudden the doorknob started to rattle.  someone was coming in.  paranoid- i snorted everything and shoved the shaving kit bag under the couch.  Kym was so new to drug paranoia she stood in front of the door to see who dared to come in unannounced.  

Caesar walked in.

Kym gave him an icy stare, ""Don't you knock fucker?""

Caesar shrugged, ""When I knock people who owe seldom open the door.  You should lock your door.  This is a bad neighborhood.""

""We owe you jack shit so fuck off vato!"", said Kym.

Even though I was felt the high creeping - I tensed up but Caesar merely shook his head and walked over to me.  He put his arm around me good naturedly and led me into the kitchen.

""Where's Jason?"", he asked.

""I don't know.  He never came home."", I answered.

Kym pulled out the drug stash and started to fix up bumps on the table.  Alarms went off in my head but Kym did not care.  Caesar walked over and watched her for a second and then he walked back to me.  his smile was like that of a lazy cat.

""Where'd you get that?"", he asked as he lit a joint and offered me a hit.  

I took it and shrugged.  I got it at Lucky 13 from a Vietnamese connect that I met through Jason.

""I bought it at the park."", I lied.  Caesar stared right through me.

""That's more of that gook shit thats going around."", he said, ""Was the dude that sold it Asian looking?""

""Maybe.""

""You know"", sighed Caesar, ""I work hard to cover these 4 blocks where we live.  I will deliver anywhere, anytime all the apartments, stores, bars, whatever.  It hurts me to see you buy this shit."", said Caesar pointing the joint at Kym.

I nodded.

""You don't know what those gooks cut it with.  Poison dude, the cheap fucks.  That shit is dangerous man."" said Caesar solemnly.  

He walked over to me, looked into my eyes and pointed 2 fingers at his forehead.  ""It's like putting a bullet here,"" he moved his fingers to his temple, ""and here.""

I nodded.

""Do you understand me?"", he asked.

Anyone care to guess what might be happening here?  Presumably taking 6mg of a narcotic pain-reliever should 'feel' pretty different to tylenol.  Could this be tolerance built-up from the codeine.

Anyone else ever had an epic day or week where it changed their hustle or seriously improved their dealer situation?

In high school I played older brother to a bunch of younger kids that were really cool kids but for my muscle head high school considered nerdy.

Fast forward my first year out of college I'm scraping by selling beats /session engingeering/mixing/mastering mostly for struggle rappers. It doesn't pay great, everyone thinks they're the shit and have paid some dues that you haven’t, they rap about lean like it's strong and I giggle to myself with a nose full of opana.

I offer my help because I've written a shit ton at this point for jobs ranging a variety of industries (for my age) so I have a good idea (I've been hired consistently) how to focus a resume towards a specific job application.

He then politely brushes me off and explains he wants someone to truly hold his hand through the process/type it up, send it to him to get approved and that he wants to pay. Como se dice, SIGN ME UP!

He says he will pay 250. I did it under the easiest deadline of 48 hours which he considered rushed. He i guess he liked my work and mentioned it to a friend of his, and so on. Now I have 15 other orders and completed 8 others in the first week. Best part is these are kids I know from high school (not necessarily homies with 'em) so the price now starts at 500 (receiving the finished product no less than a week from the day I collect/received the pertinent information) because I went to a private high school (USA private school) and steeply increases if they want it sooner than 7 days. Each case takes roughly 2 hours MAX not including time spent gathering their achievements.

On my dealer front however…
I moved to a Venice Beach, Los Angeles, where I had no connects for anything other than weed, after spending some time at home after college which is when my affair with roxy and open became more than a fling. Kicked when I came out here and didn't look too hard but I found a dealer sold them 25, 20 if you bought 10. Coming from the bible belt where I’ve seen someone pay 45 for a fucking 224 this was too good to pass up for me but I made sure to only have one dealer. In my eyes the money was already spent me saving $10 ot onr yhitf gr

This dude compared to the trailer park addicts with medical problems was much more professional (less of a middleman) and better with time and much better than the ever fluctuating trailer park price hustle (around the refill dates in the month like the first when people collecting assistance get enough money to fill scripts and then could sell them to the hustlers). 

Unfortunately for me, great overall and for him, my guy works as a writer and he got a good enough gig that he doesn’t need to support his habit. He was vague but I’m thinking maybe he got into the writers guild. We wrote together some, talked about TV writing, writing and literature in general; we were the tightest I’ve been with a roxy/pill dealer. Felt like he was a college weed dealer the way we would hangout and he give me lines or powder to parachute while he slammed.  Never imagined my favorite dude I would meet via a CL cold cop.

Makes me sad because he was the best but OH MY GOD HE JUST GAVE ME HIS PLUG! Seriously, I hit up his dude, he asks if I know McDealingston and I say I do, he asks for my name so he can save it in his phone and I say ""Frank"" and then he confirms my car type (apparently I was one of very few my guy aka McDealingston passed up). He says ""Word, roxy for you is 5 a piece, sometimes up to 10 but not often, bars 2 each, klonopin the same, and I have other stuff but that is what McDealingston told me you liked. As time goes by you will notice I  never say: “I’m out,” or “I’m waiting on my guy to reup,” or  “Give me 10 minutes”. “ I don’t have regular hours, when I’m awake I’m open. ” 

Sounds like bullshit but my old guy assured me it was legit and it is. Holy shit, I’m down with the hours, dude can do what he wants. He is the only dude I have had that hooks it up like this for even small amounts and if you text him you’re five minutes away he is outside in four minutes.

This is the perk of being liked by your dealer is - be kind and considerate

I've used my fair share of psychedelics and some stimulants, but never touched opiates so I am pretty clueless about side effects, etc. I've been taking them for pain, but I've definitely noticed myself nodding out a bit and enjoying the ride as well. 


They gave me 2 at the hospital immediately following my surgery, and I've taken 7 from my prescription in the last 72 hours (so 9 total).



I'm coming down from the one I took when I woke up, and I definitely feel a little bit anxious and my head has a bit of pressure, but not a normal 'headache'. I'm also more irritable than normal and I got a bit lightheaded when standing up (but that could be related to the surgery/pain).


So my question: How long does it take to develop a dependency on opiates / oxycodone in specific? Considering the symptoms I have coming down right now, is it advisable to ween myself off of them or are these normal side effects of the drug?

It is good to be clean(ish). I have been an addict for 9 years. But I also have a severe nerve pain condition.

But I still have episodes of severe pain that I need opiates for. The last month or so of sobriety has been soured by the unmanageable pain. My oxy doctor does not know I am on subs, should I even tell him if I want to get another script from him?


My questions:

1. Would I still be able to get a prescription for oxy since I went to treatment and subsequently got labeled a drug abuser? Would insurance still pay for it?

2. How much oxy would it take to break through 10 to 12mg of suboxone?

3. Should go it alone and try to manage my pain illicitly? Or should I tell my doctor about everything in confidence that he will get me the pain management I need even though I am a drug abuser?

They were both on the fence of discharging me and recommending the residential... What I don't understand, is that how heroin, which showed up as hydromorphone metabolites and other things showed up after an entire **WEEK** of not using! This was on Thursday. I had drug tests, thursday was when I was first drug tested and had tested positive, Tuesday which I still tested positive but the levels were lower, and on thursday 3/19 when it shouldn't have showed at all.  It makes no fucking sense... I did that third drug test completely confident that nothing would happen and I would be clean. I explained my relapse this weekend but she's cool and won't drug test me and will Thursday.... 

but fucking A I don't understand how it still showed for my first relapse after a week. I'm getting a weird sense someone tampered with my results or something is fucked up. How can Heroin show up positive after a week? I didn't use at all during that time frame so it makes no fucking sense. I guess I'll just stay clean from now on from everything until this is all over... It's better than being independent from my family financially and having to stop my school.. Something is not right though with the drug test. I am starting to think it was tampered with.

Then I'm either going to be done with this or celebrate...**

My bullshit IOP I've been in for 2-3 weeks accusing me of being dishonest and lying. Yes I am dishonest to them somewhat, I'd lie unless I had a drug test. I had a relapse at the start and unfortunately that was when I got my first random urine drug screen... and they have a drug test so fucking extensive it tests the GC-MS bullshit. It's 3 pages long. I tested positive for even alcohol when I had a drink 3 days ago with my roommate in college. WTF? Anyways, after my first relapse, my
last two drug tests, the second one still showed positive for opiates since the test is so fucking powerful. However, after a week and I took a drug test it showed positive still they say and want to kick me out?? The last one was for sure negative I am 100% sure. 

I'm fucking pissed. The people in my IOP, they have had way more relapses there than I have and I'm being singled out to be kicked out and since my Dad listens to these douchebag ""professionals"" they are recommending some sort of residential treatment. Fuck that. I'm halfway done in my spring semester of college and I'm not going to through it away for some 1-2 month residential inpatient program. I'm so pissed right now. The people in the IOP I talked to also said that's fucking bullshit and one guy's been in there for a while with 5-10 relapses under his belt while there...

I have more to say but it'd be too long... I just dont know what to do. 

In the event I do get kicked out from this bullshit program, and I might since I relapsed yesterday and just now.... what should I do? How much does an apartment cost? 

From saving up and a fund I have under my name at my bank, I have an ""okay"" amount of money to survive on for a while, no car though. I have my own money, not ALL my money goes to dope... and in the event things go to shit, my parents won't support me, I'll have to find my way... It's always all or nothing with them, no grey area. ""Do you want to continue using heroin for the rest of your life?"" blahblahblah... I'm fucking pissed tho cause my 3rd drug test I am 100% positive I didn't test dirty and they claiming I did which i find out via my dad. They don't have the guts to fucking call me first???

I weigh 58 kg (135 pounds?). Really nice, bit of a rush and then just heaps of ""mmm this feels nice"". Also wrote a guitar song about oxy, lyrics are terrible (kinda funny) but it's actually an original chord progression, strumming pattern and melody. I've never written a song that isn't ""this is obviously derived from ..."" before so really happy.

Anyway, I have 6 left, gonna trade some with a friend for some weed and have 3 left. Gonna have those 3 Friday and smoke with a friend, few questions.

How can I best use these 3 (15mg) to get the strongest high. I've heard oral is better than snorting for the amount absorbed, but snorting has a nice rush. So oral>snorting I guess. But what about oral vs plugging? Plugging would have a fast onset = a rush right? And still as strong as oral? I'm perfectly happy with my sexuality so I'm not insecure about plugging 

Another question. 1 and a half days from first use, that won't make it way weaker will it?

And finally, oxy then weed? Weed then oxy? How to use weed with the oxy?

**tldr** ignore all the waffle, last few lines are the actual questions. Waffle is just cos this oxy makes typing fun.

Also I got these legally after getting wisdom teeth out, my drug source mainly sells weed lsd mdma mda and dmt so I don't really have addiction potential since I don't have a source for any form of painkiller",1427288257.0

Few questions.,"Hey, so, long story short I overdosed again back in January and I just got the chance to see my psychiatrist, she prescribed me two of these(two packets, so it should be 4 injectors and 2 trainers) first I'm curious if anyone has ever used these in a real life situation or had them used on yourself, and if so how many injections were needed and what is your gender/height/weight and the drug you took+dosage(I'm wondering how effective these are really).


I'm also wondering if there is some sort of medical alert card or bracelet or necklace so that someone would see I have it, I've got a medical alert card for my spinal cord stimulator so that in the event of me being incapacitated at a hospital they don't give me an MRI without surgically removing the stimulator first(it would at the very least cause severe burns to my spine and abdomen to have an MRI with the device in, at worst it could tear it lose and with it, some spinal cord). And, I've found that that card was actually looked at in just such a case and I was pulled out of an MRI just before it was turned on because they saw it in my wallet). But, I suppose what I'm getting at is, carrying narcan for my own safety is great, but what good does it do me if nobody knows I have it when I need it?

Anyone with knowledge about this topic could confirm?
Besides painkillers with paracetalmol/aspirin, what other medications can be acquired without prescription (as in cough syrups)? Any medications with Dihydrocodeine?

Does anyone have any experiences related to buying OTC drugs? Are there any problems with it, as in could the pharmacist decide not to give you the cough syrup, even if it is OTC?
In Spain, for example, every pharmacist has his own story. They could even sell you prescription opiates if you are friendly enough and if you promise that it will only be this one time - but sometimes they won't even sell you OTC painkillers if they suspect that you are going to misuse it; in Germany it is virtually impossible to get anything with opiates.
I would like to know the situation in other countries in Europe!

Now, I don't have an EXTREME tolerance, but it's middle of the road

I can put 100mgs of good heroin up my nose and not get a nod, just a decent high

So I thought why not take that norco with them just to boost the effects, it's not like it would get me high by itself

So after taking the methocarbamol I took the 1 hydro and waited

an hour later I am just really high, like an outrageously impressive high from only 10mgs of hydro

anyways it really got to me because im depressed at it is and i got in the fuckit mode because he bitched me out in front of 5 other stuck up assholes and left class, and bought a bag.  i wish people would just mind their own business because he really has no idea what i'm going through. sorry for the rant just nodding out and rambling",1427259623.0

I might be able to get my hands on some piss that has what I need, but it is not a guarantee because it is coming from a friend of a friend and my friend is having trouble reaching his friend.

I found this website that says it sells synthetic piss with suboxone in it: http://www.drugtest-solutions.com/suboxone_positive_synthetic_urine.htm

They claim it is guaranteed to work but I can't take any chances.

The good news is I think I'm taking the test at my regular doctor (GP) not a drug testing facility so they are unlikely to watch me piss or anything like that--in fact I can say I'm going for a physical and ask for the drug test after they've collected the urine.

It was like a jet airplane warming up and it would SLAM into the walls we shared knocking the dust from my shelves down in wavy little rivulets...Then silence.  i climbed back under the couch cushions where i hid from sunlight like some undead thing mouldering in a crypt.  i made a mental note to look into curtains or sheets or something to replace the ones Molly set on fire with her tarot candles.  i was almost asleep when a coffee grinder shrieked to life.  the sound reminded me of this root canal i had a week ago.  i moaned and crawled out.  fuck.  this sleep thing is not happening.  i accidentally stepped on Vince who groaned beneath a pile of jackets on the floor.  

""Jesus dont you people ever sleep?""!"", yelled Vince popping up like a vampire from his blanket cocoon.  ""Turn that grinder off!""

""Fuck you Vince."", said Molly crawling under the cushions to snuggle me.  ""Finally they awaken.  The Gruesome Twosome"", she smiled.

Vince and I were prepping for our lecture.  Meth and heroin kept me steady.  Vince did some meth for the first time and really seemed to like it.  Never a good sign.  I brought Vince over from the dorms to prep for our Tuesday night lecture on thermodynamics.  I had known Vince from the dorms and we are kindred souls.  Vince was from Hong Kong, dressed like his mom bought his clothes and wore thick glasses that darkened in UV light.  Vince didnt know it but he was so fucking punk.  everyone saw this nerdy Asian kid but there was an intensity that burned inside Vince.  he was so unassuming that when you saw it explode it was fucking cataclysmic nuclear nova glorious.
 
""Baby go ask Neela if she can help us..."", asked Molly.  I could smell coffee and gave up on sleep.  Molly had been eating x and snorting ketamine for 2 nights.  She wanted to come down.  The problem was no one had anything but weed or meth.

I sighed but we all knew Neela had dope and was high because her Andy Gibb greatest hits was on repeat.  she liked to nod to the soothing sounds of the Bee Gees too but Andy was her favorite.  hell, everyone living 2 apartments away from her knows this.

""Ok"", I agreed because i had barely a point left stashed beneath my boot lining - the one place I think...heheh that Molly didn't know about.

So we trooped over to the neighbor.  Neela was old.  But to put that in context we just started going to bars so she was maybe 40ish?  Our place featured sterile white walls, empty shelves, Molly's Cure and Depeche Mode posters, no curtains, burn marks, 1 couch, 1 coffee table and a TV on milk crates.  Neela LIVED here.  Every inch was Neela.  Blue walls with orange trim, vines and house plants, cats, paintings, real furniture like a dining room table and matching living room furniture.  It was so grown up.

Vince sat like a gargoyle on her couch mute and antisocial as usual for he was shy.  Neela liked him because her cats liked him.  Molly hugged Neela while I looked around.  I never saw Neela get high.  No visible track marks so maybe she snorted.  After my hug I broached the subject.  Neela had glassy gone eyes but sighed.  She loved our company but did not like scoring, business or talks about money.  But we knew she was connected.

""I'm trying to cut back"", she said.  

So I launched into my spiel how dry it was and she rolled her eyes dramatically.

""What about your friend Jeff?""

""Dry.""

""How about Mr. Maru?""

""Gone.""

I was lucky here because Mr. Maru sold heroin to keep his weird parties alive and not for money.  You had to be interesting to buy some of the best dope in the city from Mr. Maru.  I brought Molly over and he was wearing a black 1piece bodysuit with a mask that had his face sealed behind black pantyhose and framed with a white dragon's horns.  Molly tripped out though I warned her about the nudity, weirdness, sex, etc.  He banned Molly for life because she is ""fucking ice cold bitch.""     

""Oh yeah he goes to Hawaii in winter...What about Nguyen?""

I shot Vince a look but he refused to acknowledge it.  The cut on his head was still fresh.  We almost scored 2 nights ago with Nguyen at Lucky 13 but now couldn't go back for a month.

We were having fun at 13 with some physics club kids and this jerk in a Social Distortion t-shirt and leathers saw a dorky Asian kid hunched over a beer laughing.  so he bumped Vince whose face went dark as he stood up and said ""Hey, watch it.""

The guy laughed and saw Vince's NASA t-shirt and pushed him again.  ""You watch it space boy.  I'll fuck you up like that space shuttle.""

Our friends were shocked.  We worshipped NASA.  We saw the bigger picture of the universe and our academic goals and career choices were sacrifices to better humanity.  And this guy...

""Can you hold these?"", Vince asked handing me his glasses.

And just like that he started punching the guy repeatedly in the face.  The explosion of violence was sudden and surprised everyone including the guy who froze making an easy target.  Before the guy could drop unconscious Vince was dragging him to the bar while headbutting him and screaming, ""Good people died!  Never fuck with NASA!""

So yeah.  No more Nguyen who was the bartender.  That was a great connect.

Neela went through more names and I shook my head.  I knew this was hard for her.  She would have to go to her ex husband.  He ran a garage/chop shop, was a dick but heavily into the biker trade.  If you asked him, the dude could probably get you a white baby in 2 hours.

Neela crossed her arms and said, Well ok handsome.  But you owe me a dance...""

I knew this was coming and was not high enough to go along happily.  But I did it.  We danced to An Everlasting Love.  Neela was Indian and did these crazy Bollywood moves as we swirled in her apartment to Andy Gibb...I smiled and let the music take me away from this life.  Molly loved Neela because she could not coax this from me.  I have no idea why I could dance without an ounce of self-consciousness with Neela but she took me there...

looking back those weird dance sessions to get Neela to go bug her ex husband for drugs were amazing.  another favorite was the Bee Gees Too Much Heaven which is a song i still equate to a heroin high...so ethereal and releasing you from the physical world into the next...

i wish I knew what happened to Neela.  but i did a semester on the east coast and when i came back and rang her door an old Chinese lady answered.  

i wish you peace Neela and Dhanyavaad for EVERYTHING...",1427253477.0

After a while of using, even after stopping a few times, I could never get that moderate dose magic back.  Euphoria, minimal nausea, perfect body high. 

Does heroin feel that different apart from more sedation?

Clean for 6 months with no desire to go back, just curious.

Edit: thanks guys, did some more reading and TIL the potency of an opioid doesn't always correlate with the quality of the experience.",1427236958.0
306pso,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/306pso/ropiates_wiki/,52,https://redd.it/306pso,n0dsquad,r/opiates Wiki??,"I noticed that going to the 'Wiki' for /r/opiates (a lot of diff subs have/use their Wiki), it results in an error: 'Forbidden; you_may_not_view'. I assume that only the mods can view it then? I think it'd be good to make it publicly viewable by anyone (with maybe some specific, mod-only viewable parts), and you can add a lot of useful stuff to it. 

Some examples might be: 
-Harm reduction guidelines
-Potentiation section
-Noob stuff/beginners info
-Warnings
-Dedicated stamp reports
-Local warnings (fake pills, fent laced dope, etc)
-Different tutorials (CWE, Plugging, IV'ing correctly, etc)
-Various story series in an order, like for example, 'The Day That Broke Me', all the parts (and links to each one, or Copy/Pasted txt to the wiki page for it), 'Epidemic' series, and some other story series' that other people here have worked on that I haven't seen yet, or were before I joined or something, you know what I mean? 

Now I know most of these on the list are already technically in the sub, and can be found by searching, or even just posting a new thread (like some people do to ask something that's already been posted/answered, but didn't bother to search lol), but imho having this stuff in the Wiki would keep everything very well organized. You could also have another stickied thread stating that the Wiki is now viewable/open/public, and to check it out for various stuff.

Idk, has anyone else thought of this? A lot of subs use their Wiki's, why not us? Was it open at one point but now shut down or something? Or just for mods to discuss secret things or whatever? 

I'd be willing to help organize it, add stuff to it from various older posts, write/manage pages in it, and even moderate it if wanted.

But yea I'm mainly curious as to if it used to be used at all (if so, what happened to it), and if anyone else, whether they thought about it or not prior to reading this thread, thinks that it'd be a cool/useful think to implement/re-implement. Perhaps it could even be voted on if there's enough interest. And I'd obviously like to see some mod's opinions/views on this.

Thanks guys! I really think it has a lot of potential to keep everything really organized, easy to find, and hold a lot more resources (lists of needle exchanges, states where rigs are sold w/o a script, shit like that) than just reading the few sidebar links/posts.

Searching for old posts often isn't ideal usually because often the body of the OP's post just says [deleted], and often have a ton of deleted comments and shit (Sorta off topic to this post, but I always thought that was weird af. The older the thread is, the more [deleted] comments/OP's posts there are. I haven't seen any other sub's older posts like that. I've read 5+ year old threads on other subs, and still a majority of the comments are there. But here, lol, a month goes by and 3/4 the comments are deleted.... Wtf is up with that!? lmao)

Anything from Tramadol to Oxy. At my most I was doing about 160 mg a day, but ended up tapering on my own, and getting fully clean for quite awhile, around 6 months. 

Then I had a serious construction roof accident (it was my job at the time) where I fell and damaged nerves in my back and leg, along with shattering my knee.  So I'm in constant pain unless I take something, which I'm prescribed 20mg Hydro a day...sometimes going to 40mg. I barely feel anything, but don't want myself to get out of control again. 

Since I don't want shit to hit the fan again, do you think I should transfer over to subs? Because when I've taken those, the pain does subside, and there's a limited opportunity to overdo it (yes, I know you can).

Ahem...
Questions and main details are in bold, feel free to skip right to them...

***How much would you- or anyone if you don't use anymore (just try to figure it out based on your past experience)- have to space out their heroin use to avoid WD or have them be so mild you could still sleep, or pop a small amount of codeine when you fucked up a little and did a bit too much???*** As in, No WD at all and when would that change and become mild wd, also assuming at that point you're not using tons of dope. 

***Have you ever successfully chipped for years at a time?***

***I'm talking about IV use but if you want to tell me why sniffing would be totally different go ahead but I think if a person snorts lots of dope and I shoot less than they snort they're going to be in the same situation or in fact will be more addicted than me.*** And if they sniff every day and I shoot 2 days in a row, saw Saturday and Sunday only again I think I'd be in a better situation , obviously. 

Also, if I really only used once a week maybe instead of say one point I could do three points every Sunday and the end result would be the same, some cravings but no real physical WD to speak of. 

There have been great famous scientists that have been addicted to morphine for years and were pretty well adjusted, one wrote that book ""The Addicted Brain"" and he used to steal morphine from the rat studies he was dojng, there's a great interview of him on youtube, his name escapes me atm but you can look him up via his book if you're curious.

SPOILER ALERT; I am not a brilliant scientist.Shocking, I know, heh.  Hell, I'm not even as sharp of a guitar player anymore ffs.  I stopped playing a little before my brutal soul sucking divorce and then didn't really play for a year now... So I'm rusty as fuck and need to get back in to it. My point is that's another thing that took a backseat to other concerns and then I just looked at a calendar one day and thought what am I doing?? What if I forget one of my own songs. 

I didn't use for 7 days, I then used today on day 8. I would like to think if I didn't use tomorrow(whether I do or not) and then used once more when I work on the 27th. But didn't use on the 28th(SAT) but did use on the 29th(Sun-you know, good TV day :)  ) and then didn't use from the 30th till Wednesday the 1st of April, I'd be fine. 

So that would go...
Day on, day off, day on, day off , day on, DAY OFF, DAY OFF , DAY ON.

I could try to list a bunch of examples like 2 days in a row-on. 5 off. Once a week, etc, but in the interest of a to the point thread I'm ASKING YOU TO ***TELL ME WHAT'S WORKED FOR YOU IN THE PAST or WHAT YOU THINK WOULD WORK IF YOU'VE ALWAYS USED ""ALL THE TIME""/as much as you can WHEN ACTIVELY USING DOPE*** So like, if you're a balls to the wall guy, you can just guess :P or maybe you remember a time before your every day use and you've got lots of experience from when you were chipping ? If so please share it. 

Back when I was just sniffing dope I had no schedule, I just didn't use every day, and it worked pretty good. Even when I started shooting it was the same, and I didn't think about it. But by never thinking about it one day I looked up , probably on a day I was running out of money and getting dopesick, and realized I've been using every day almost for months and I should have paid attention but I just fell into it, I'm sure someone here can relate. 

I've read about guys here -like that guy managing a grocery store who worked his way up and now makes 100K a year and gets by just fine ordering his dope from the DNM but he also uses EVERY SINGLE DAY. I think he's a super cool guy simply cause he worked his way up from stoking shelves and now can afford to own a house, a nice car, and a huge dope habit. PRETTY COOL. But he uses every day.

I'm thinking more of like that cool guy yeaheroin who says he uses once a week and happens to use other drugs on other days of the week and seems to totally have his shit together. He also does a computer based job*(SysAdmin I think??) Love his posts either way.  and as someone slowly learning how to code via CodeCadamy that's just another reason I like his posts. 

You can answer with a pill dose schedule if you don't know what heroin is like, I'm really just interested in heroin atm, but I'd be curious to see what pill people say. If we're talking strong pills like dillies I think it would be safe to asume the number of days on and off would be the same. I also think it's about days on and off not like how much, as in I think I could use a half gram once every two weeks and it wouldn't mean shit. spread it over 5 days as a point a day and do the same thing when that bag runs out and you have what happened to me recently... trying to use every day- even if it's just a point, so of course I got sick when that train finally flipped the tracks after months of keeping it going somewhow...IDK how.. I'm working one job that doesn't pay enough or give me enough hours and I didn't steal or hook and yet I always found a ""if I trade you some hash for cash"" or ""if you lend me x dollars"" way to get things done. Till I ran out of options. 

Anyway, I think that's all I need to ask. It's late here and I'm pretty high atm, I hope this was written well enough. 

If even this short post is a little tl ; dr for you ***PLZ Just tell me how much you'd have to space out dope to avoid WD*** THAT""S IT. and you can forget answering the more nuanced question, and all the other questions I asked. 

That's the main thing I care about in this thread. What various people think that formula is. I think the guy I mentioned using once a week has pretty much got it, but can that be pushed in any way. they say(before you really use) you need a couple of weeks of solid use to build an addiction) but I feel like after quiting for 7 when you've been using for months(almost daily) I could go back into wd with just 3-6 days of use in a row, no? 

EDIT: Before I forget... This thread is not for the guys that said I wasn't a ""real junkie"" congrats guys I've 'overused' dope a number of times in the last year or so and I've gone thru wd far more than once, I sure hope I'm living up to your expectations... tho... if ever escalating costs and an ever climbing tolerance is what a ""real junkie"" is than I don't think I want to be one.

Summer was upon us and that meant all the perks that came with it. My buddy had his house all to himself for the season, I just got a job as a lowly barista, and to top off this dope sundae there was this stunning chick who was super all about me. It seemed like a pretty sick setup. Throw on some groovy tunes at work, close up and walk out into that warm summer night where the dark fresh air and streetlights instantly revitalize you for another round. I sail over to my buddy's where me and my mates chase that high well into sunrise with music and games as our guides and the occasional 6 A.M. BBQ sess.

And this chick, damn. She's not the type you have a future with, it's just boiling out and she's baking in her bikini. The way she bats her eyes and gives you that ""fuck me right here"" smile as you run your finger down her leg and realize she's not wearing anything under that skirt. She never wears anything under her skirt. Ugh I just want to put my tongue all over her body and taste her; she's sour, sweet. Yeah, let's do it right here.

The people at work are so chill. They're just like me. Living one day at a time and smiling with the sun. These guys don't give a fuck. Work sucks, let's have fun while we're here! Draw vaginas on cups and hide them in the pile, make shaken iced tea LA bar style, hell let's take a toke break. The one Workaholic would throw these parties at his place and man did shit get real quick. Snortin' lines from keys, dropping a few tabs, it was the season of dreams guys. 

Then the days start getting shorter, the nights colder. Man I think I've had enough frisbee for now, it's getting chilly out. You guys want to go for a burnwalk? Nah, I didn't bring my jacket. Well whatever, we just downloaded every game and show on Earth, let's start something up. But all our summer shows are over. No one can stay till 4 or 5 A.M. anymore, it's too cold and they got packing to do, school starts back up in a few weeks.

And this girl stops wearing skirts. It's time to close the pool for the year, the guys are coming tomorrow. Now she wears jeans and ugg boots. I can't see her body anymore, I can only imagine it. I want to see every curve again, see those soft fleshy limbs. I can't hear her laugh, but I can see her breath and all that summer spunk was drained from her like a faucet.

Now its cold and I don't recognize anyone anymore. My co-workers got transferred, my friends are back in school, and the cold froze my lust. It feels like I'm sleeping. I get up and the sun's out, but the air is cold and harsh. It's all just an reallusion. This is real life, but the days are fake. It's all wax and ice. That lightbulb in the sky with its fluorescent light... and the joker pulling the string to turn it off before we even have a chance to see that its there. I want to go outside again.

How do I cope with this shit? It'll only last about a week since it's kratom, but this is still really shitty.

It's also way stronger than I feel like it should be. Snorting 20mg (weighed out on a scale) gets me high enough that I feel like doing more wouldn't be safe. Now, I have 0 tolerance (been months since doing any opiates), but 20mgs still seems like not enough to get me that high. I got it from CanadianForger.

The other place I've been to is kind of a quickstop before the real rehab, but after looking at the schedules, they're not that different. There were no rules at all really, except doing drugs etc obviously. It's more like a hospital. We have the option to go to a gym, but it's not mandatory so usually no one bothers.

How's the dope where you are?","Wrote this out earlier and my fucking computer locked up, here we go again... I'm living on the West Coast of Canada, couple hours outside the glorious city of Vancouver BC in the Lowermainland. It's nice, except it's also the second most unaffordable city on earth, hence why I'm in a town outside of it. Voted the 'best' often and always around the top 3, but also ridiculously unaffordable. Yay. go Canada. 

So when I hear my good pals to the South(Die ISIS, suck a dick then kill yourself over the confusion of such a 'sin'. Sin, lol, level me up guize, magic the gathering and other made up shit-PEW PEW, PEW!) Dem Americanos' are always saying TAR ON THE WEST COAST and ECP(Easy Coast Powder) I know this isn't the case in everyone's situation as surely there are West Coast people getting dope better than tar, tho I also hear that some tar can be pretty good. Personally I'd LOVE to try some tar if only just to save some money. 

So here's the thing, I've been getting nothing but powder dropped on me as of late. I took 7 days off from dope and there it was again, powder. I had 2 absolute shit bags weeks ago, THEN THE WONDERFUL HARD CHUNKS OF DOPE appeared again. I know part of it's psychological but for me the chunks of dope I need to break up myself are always better. I realize these can be and are probably cut too, FINE. But I got an amazing .3 chunk a few weeks ago and the next time it was right back to this powder shit again. Now the crew I go to has this all the time. It was almost like fate that he only had 3 points, I thought to myself if it's loose I want half as much, and then I had no choice cause I bought his last 3 points till he picks up a refill. And at least they have the fucking decency to only charge $50 again. fuckers tried to make every point $20 at one time. All I could think was are you fucking kidding me? Of course there I am trying to get 6 points and he only has 3. So much for my wishy washy resolve. 


Sometimes I'm tempted to go to the notorious Downtown Eastside to buy on the street, I found one article where I heard you really can get dope for $10! Ten Fucking Dollars, if those are point fuck I want those. But buying on the street randomly might take some time to perfect and I would want to find a guy who has an actual phone number and great dope instead of just going to the places I've read about and trying to score. I've been downtown many times and I used to start my work day on Pender street right near Hastings, it's like here's Chinatown, walk one block this way and BOOM here's Canada's poorest postal code and all the good and BAD that happens down there. 

I can't wait to fucking have enough saved that I feel like converting say $300-500 into bitcoin and making a quick few purchases while the bitcoin is high and somewhat stable. 

So here's my questions now that you have the background..

If you're getting ECP or on the West Coast and getting powder, is it GOOD? Don't you find that chunks of dope are usually better? Every time I have to break it up myself it seems like better quality. and not just cause I know powder can be cut, hard pieces can be as well... but the hard shit just always seems better to me. 

>>>>>>***QUESTIONS***<<<<<<<<<<<<<<



***WHAT ABOUT YOU, Hard chunks of dope vs powder?(Your opinions and GENERAL Area you live, PLZ)***

***What about tar?? Do you get good tar? Do you save a good chunk of money buying tar??***

***Do you have any experience buying from the Dark Web? If so, how do your buys online compare to what you can get in your local area with just a phone call?***

Lastly,...
***Do you live in an area that has a GOOD or BAD Cold Copping scene?***
like... can you go to X corner and you know you're going to get great dope?

There's a corner in the Downtown Eastside that's literally known across Canada as ""the corner"". I did some research and found out about how the dope scene used to be inside in various cafes and such, cheap hotels etc...The big difference now is it's been moved outside. I really want to go down there but it's not like buying dope in the 'burbs out here, clearly. But I'm going to get a small amount of kratom from a headshop and go downtown(not just the Eastside)some day soon, going to make a day of it and get a nice meal from a place I've never eaten and try to score some cheaper and maybe even better dope. With just a little googling I found statements from cops saying shit like ""It never moves far from here"" talking about a corner and how things have been like that for so long. I found other statements from the guy who organizes the sale of goods down there...where binners make a little money in what is truly a really poor area... and he talks about a park where he claims thousands of dollars of dope is sold every single day. 

I really would just like to find a guy with a phone number. Not be served by a junkie making a few bucks for running around, or possibly just taking my money and running. I read about a lady that used to hook but now just runs around making a little off each buy she help with, and if I grew to trust someone I don't mind letting a needy person make 5-10$ off me if they're grabbing me a big order like $100 worth or something. But I'd like to start slow and maybe just put out feelers by getting a couple points at a time. I'm willing to risk $20 at a time till I find someone selling really good dope.

I'm sick of powder and if it's powder I want to be wow'd. TODAYS BAGS SEEM OK. After 7 days of no dope I got a rush, my pupils are small from one shot and I don't feel ripped off, just overcharged. 

Even Ohio has some amazing dope(Drugs Inc told me so) it's a major hub now, I told that to a guy I know from Facebook and his old friend chimed in saying all the drugs (literally listing off all the general most popular drugs) in Cleveland ""are pure shit"" and that the rest of the state is probably the same. Right like the circle of people he knows is everything in a whole state. 

In the burbs I'm overcharged and I long to order from the Dark Web. Next comes taking the bus and Skytrain for over 2 hours to get downtown and cold cop. I'd love to meet a great new dealer, or hell just have 3-5 people that I could call for dope. 
This is how I feel now...
DARK WEB>Local(cause two hours travel sucks)>Cold copping on the Downtown Eastside. 

But I'm sure if I can find better local people I would be happy to take the bus downtown sometimes. And it would probably help me use a little less, cause all that travel would keep me from doing as much. 

***If this is tl;dr for you just jump to the QUESTIONS and give your feedback, I figured I would tell you what my scene is like.***

However, I do have a guy with some H. If I end up not being able to get any roxies I'll go get some of the H instead, but I have no idea how much I should expect to get for $30 or $40. I'm near Atlanta, not sourcing but prices are pretty location specific, so it's relevant. Can anyone help?

Edit/update - so I waited a little bit for my guy, and he apparently gave me .3 for $40 'because I had to wait so long,' which was nice of him. I have no idea if he actually gave me .3 or not, but I got a grayish-white rock a little bit bigger than a pencil eraser, plus about half an eraser's worth of smaller chunks/powder. I snorted about 1/4th of the total amount, and after a bit of trepidation I began to feel marvelous; the ride home was magnificent! The amount that I did felt about equivalent to taking two blues at once - about twice my normal dose (I usually take one at a time). I'm not entirely sure that I like H better than blues (it's a bit too sedating), but as a substitute when blues are unavailable it's really spectacular, and great value too - I would estimate this bag'll last me about 4 days, which would've cost me about $150 if I were buying the pills. I think next time I'll do slightly less though - it was getting a bit hard to keep my eyes open after about a half hour, and as much as I love my opiates, I feel like going to sleep would be a big waste of a high. To everyone who posted and helped me out, thank you thank you thank you! I got some terrific advice, which not only kept me safer, but also helped me avoid not doing enough and wasting it. This wasn't my first time doing dope, but it was definitely the first time I've ever done good dope - the other two times I did it I either had shitty stuff or didn't do enough, because they were rather lackluster experiences. In any case, I'm perfectly fine, had a great night, and I very much appreciate everyone's excellent advice and concern for my safety. /r/opiates is by far my favorite sub, and this is one of the reasons why. Thank you!

Edit number two: my preferred ROA is oral - can anyone offer a comparison for the BA of H when taken orally vs. insufflated? I assume it's much lower, otherwise everyone would be eating it instead of snorting/IVing, but does anyone know how much lower? If the difference isn't too dramatic I think I'd prefer to try making some heroin tea or something. Thanks again!",1427421360.0

But now I have a studio apartment where I'm paying half as much rent. (Naturally I spend the spare cash on dope.) I live on the ground floor (yes I do have huge steel bars on my windows!) and I often hear sketchball shit going down but usually it's about crack or dimes of shitty weed. 

I have a dealer who delivers to me (for free!) so that's usually how I acquire my daily dose of drugs. But my friend owed me money so today she gave me some bags that her bf copped for us down on the block. They are fuckin fire, so I was already stoked on today! I know the block bags are better and fatter than what I get, but I stick out like a sore thumb down there, and after awhile of going down there pretty much daily, I realized I wasn't gonna keep getting lucky so I never go anymore. So it's a nice treat when I get to try whatever bag is currently best on the streets. Today it was One Way, and he got them early in the AM so they were extra fat! Like 1.5x the bags I've been getting. :) 

As well as providing my dope, my friend gave me a papasan chair, and a really cute pink antique sofa bench that I've always admired at her house! And a book about making cheese. I was pretty pleased with my haul, and was setting up my papasan chair, when I heard something outside my window that I've never heard before....""I got dope, too."" 

I cracked my blinds and saw a guy literally almost pressed against my window bars. Clearly this is my lucky day! But I stepped outside and he was already gone. Some crack head lady from up the block started yelling to ask me if I needed anything, but I said ""nah I just live here"" to get rid of her. I thought the dude had walked off and I'd missed my chance. I never hear anything about dope around here. But then a few minutes later I heard him again and saw him by my steps, so I made my move. I got one bag to test it out, and we exchanged numbers. 

It was honestly hard to tell how good it was because I had already sniffed 4 bags of the fire from the block. But I could tell by the smell/taste/texture that it was decent dope and not full of cut. However I was really disappointed in the size, but I decided not to bitch about it or anything. Well I was surprised because dude hit me up about 30 min later just to ask how I liked it because it was a new stamp. I told him the bags were really small and he actually asked me if he should sell them as nicks instead? And said he would get me next time (but we'll see about that, I feel like he could have walked up the block and given me $5 if he was really that concerned lol.) And he will sell late at night which is when I get home from work. I can't believe I got a new dealer literally outside my window! Philly life is fuckin crazy sometimes. ",1427401962.0

And I want to try doing some opium. I am going to relapse, yea I know it is bad, but I am doing it regardless and I just want to know if there is any danger of precip wds. 

If I ween down to 8 mgs a day in the next 2 days and then wait 36 hours with nothing, then take my opium and feel nice and high for a good 12 hours then take my subs after those 12 hours, will I go into precip withdrawal? I shouldn't because there is enough bup in my system, right?

Also will 36 hours be enough time to wait after subs for a good morphine/opium buzz?

Now I've created this account to say hello.,"And to hopefully participate and chime in when I feel I have something worthwhile to contribute. I've posted here before under my main account, but I've made this one strictly for /r/opiates. 

Well, hello. I'm 28 and I live in the south. Deep south. Not the cotton plantations and one-horse towns you probably have a mental image of. No, more south than that. Gulf of Mexico is in the backyard, close to New Orleans. Once you get down this far, it actually is a lot more progressive than the stereotypical image we have. Think crappy metropolitanish city. 

Opiates and I have had a relationship for 11 years, though we've seen other people a few times. But she always comes back to me and lifts me up (or brings me down, still haven't decided). Every thought or idea I have is immediately contradicted by an equally converse one. 

I was just released from jail (again), and am hoping to abide the rules compliantly. I've got no more strikes left, my home will be inside the walls of the state penitentiary for 2 years due to a felony I caught in 2009 if I am jammed up again. 

I think, sometimes, that some of us are born to live our lives in jails and hospitals and institutions. Circumstances are in place that you cannot control no matter how earnestly your will is to defy them. Sadly, there is no rising above for the majority of us. We were born into this, our lives are our lives. Of course, I'm most certainly wrong. Or maybe not.

I don't know that I will have much to say here. I tend to start rambling in a somber tone (unless I'm high of course, which is rare, I only tend to stay well these days). I enjoy reading all of your posts here. There is a certain humanity here that isn't present in the other subs. You all are a great, colorful, interesting group of people.

kid said Fuck you man.

I graduated from college in richmond VA in 2012 and moved back home to the DC area. Got a great job out of college in the field of my major (urban planning) and things were all good. Except for the fact that I was working public sector for my local government and quickly learned that our county (one of the most prosperous in the country) is run by the most incompetent people in the world; people that don't actually live here and dont give a fuck. 

Whatever, that paid internship was good experience and I made good loot. However, it just rekindled the addiction I had in college for the last two-three years once I got a connect at home and simply had to make the short trek to the city.

Moving forward: After annual trips to europe for several months at a time to try to get clean (Denmark, Scotland, and Spain most recently). I found myself back where I started.

For the past year+ I've work for a family owned and operated apartment complex. I'm the property manager and the owner is rarely there. I'm pretty much in charge and do what I want as long as shit gets done. It's a sweet gig minus the fact it's only 33-35 hours a week, but I'm there by myself a lot. I have my dude roll through often as well as my people scoopin from me, all while slangin apartments.

I usually do pretty well budgeting my shit for the biweekly paycheck. This time period not so much. Scooped 6 g's in less than 4 days. I should've said I just picked up the spike two months ago and haven't looked back.

I was gonna sub tomorrow and dreading it because I havent had to do that in months, but as luck would have it, I middled some shit and came across essentially a little more than a g for free.

Point of this post, fml. I'm 25, have a serious spinal condition that usually 60-70 year olds get called severe spinal stenosis (narrowing of the spine) just got on the spike because it's the only thing that temporarily subdues the agonizing pain, can't save money worth shit, it's all gone by the end of each pay period, and starts all over again after each check. Have a great girl trying to support me, but has a bf and I've told her I'm into her and she even maybe into me because she wants me to move with her to nyc because she knows dc is killing me.

I mean, in my area, a G of some raw costs anywhere from 120-180. If you have a gram a day habit and get your gear for 120, that is over 40K a year (assuming you only drop 120 a day). Granted, I'm sure you may have days you don't use or even longer stretches of time that you go without it. But still conservatively, say your yearly use averages out to once every other day; that is still over 20K. Someone please explain how this habit is feasible, considering most addicts likely can't afford such an expensive habit.

Also for additional points, please tell me how you aren't dying of a bowel obstruction during any given year? Tons of laxatives? Among other organs damaged incurred by Ron's rath, long-term users must have completely fucked up G.I. tracks. There is no glam to this addiction, not even from afar, as is the case with say, soft. I understand why it's appealing given that one could make the argument that a nice buzz feels better than sex, but boy is it ugly and costly. But I am genuinely curious how those who use daily afford their addictions.

How the fuck do you afford your daily habit and how have you not died of a bowel obstruction yet?",1427613911.0

For the past hour I've been crying non-stop. How did I ever let it get this bad? Was I always predisposed to this kind of lifestyle? Why did I ever go down this road? It seemed to be the only constant in my life. Heroin cradles you in a warm fuzzy blanket, makes you feel better. It became my friend, my lover, and ultimately my life. Where did I go wrong?

He said absolutely, so I got in the car. Most of the way there, the tire blew out, hard. I basically destroyed the whole rim. This wasn't my proudest or smartest moment, but junkie logic dictated I weigh the chances of making the run while it was still holding some air, versus being stranded on the other end of town at home where I couldn't make any moves, once morning came and the remaining air and glue would be gone and the car would be useless. I ended up about 2 miles from the spot once the car was completely out of commission, so I called and asked if he could make the 3 minute drive as a huge one time favor. Of course not, so I told him I'd be walking the remaining distance. He said fine, come through. Of course, this is the part where my phone died. I walked to within half a block of the spot to a payphone in front of the majik food mart, and called my wife to update her, and have her get in touch and tell him to head out. He never answered. I waited at the payphone for good news. During my fruitless wait, someone asked if I had a crack pipe, and if I did he'd split his rock with me. I dont do hard, but I offered to help him fashion something out of a discarded beer can, my lighter and my knife.Now, at about 1 am, this 24 hour store was BUSY. I was offered hard, caps, roxies, suboxone, my beloved dilaudid, but only if I was willing to let a prostitute walk with my money.I politely declined, and she was upset enough to confirm my suspicions about her shady intentions. Her and another hooker got into it about whether or not one of them told a John the other had AIDS, and that quickly escalated from shouting, to one girl slamming the other's head repeatedly into the car door of an unusually small girl who was there slinging caps. I got a phone number from a guy who said he had high quality caps, but by the time I had given up on finding Ds, he had gone, and my phone was still dead. Still no response from the real d boy I was there for, still a guy smoking crack on the side of the building in full view of the very busy street. After one of the hookers, apparently his sister, gave him an earful about smoking outside the store, (""go back to the camper Gary! You're a fucking mess, smoking crack out here!), she decided to charge the other girl again and lick up the fist fight where it had left off. Street dealers, crack heads and normal convenience store patrons alike ran back outside for the free entertainment, and I walked away. After about the 4th person offered me a cap for $20, I went for it. Of course, it was a rock instead. An actual rock, what else should I have expected after a night like that? I ended up walking about 7 miles total to my mom's house, woke her up, and slept on her couch.What a crazy night.",1427604143.0

I've also read of people orally taking cyclizine an hour or so before dosing their methadone and having great success too, even only ingesting half their regular methadone amount.  
Has anyone ever tried cyclizine with opiates either mixed in the same rig or orally?

This happened twice and luckily I was able to pick up some subs during my last visit. I've been on the subs since early morning yesterday and before that was trying to stretch a half g of dope as long as possible. Now I'm doing fine on subs and its absolutely making it possible for me to go to work. But god damn do I want to do dope. So far there's no sign around here of dope, besides that the news says its a problem and I met someone at the bar who used to cop dope where I moved from.I hope I find something soon, on the other hand, I have plenty of subs left and could taper down and possibly be ok but this boredom is the worst and is making it impossible to keep myself occupied in between my work shifts. I am almost going to make the trek home to cop again but if I do that, its double the price.But god damn do I want to do a shot....",1427574476.0

Its probably only 5 miles from his place to mine and back. 8 called him a little while ago and he asked if I had 5 bucks for gas and i told him i had 3 bucks and its bullshit that he charges gas anyway cause hes already making money off me and he says thats not the point, like fuck you thats not the point.

Jason's mom was Mexican, wore a ton of makeup and and revealing clothes.  her boyfriend was a huge biker with a chain scarred face.  he openly leered at Kym who clutched my arm.

""Just a couple buns mom"", said Jason taking one of his mom's smokes.  ""You know I'm good for it...Later.""

""Sweety...No!  I don't want you doing this shit anymore.  Fuck what kind of a mom am I if...""

""Please?  Its just this week and then school starts so...""

""You're back in school?"", spoke the mom's boyfriend squinting suspiciously at Jason.

""Yup.  Right?"", said Jason elbowing me.  Fucking liar.

I nodded, ""Yeah he got out of academic probation so...""

""We should have a party at the bar!"", clapped his mom.

""So you mind..."", asked Jason.

his mom sighed, opened a box of See's Candy, dug through it and tossed out 2 tightly wrapped stacks of bags.  Jason tossed one to me.

""Lets see I got $30, $35...uhm..."", said Jason slowly counting out crumpled ones and fives.

""Not even close"", growled the biker.

""It's ok"", smiled his mom who I suddenly realized was nodding out during this whole transaction, ""He's back in school!""  

""Hey you gotta any coke?"", said Jason.

""Get the fuck out!"", snarled the biker and we left.

back home I went in the bathroom and slipped 2 bags into the lining of my boots that i wear until I go to bed.  Then I opened 3 bags and did a tiny bump from each.  when I came out Kym was sitting by the table tapping her black nails on the chopping mirror.  they tapped Hurry Hurry Hurry.  so I made a show of evenly dividing the bags.  1 bag, 2 bag, 3 bag and BLAST OFF...I shoved the remaining 5 bags in the plastic lining of a Misfits CD.  then I balanced a hair over the stack of CDs.  

after school I immediately spied the hair was gone.  Kym and Jason sat on the couch watching a X-Files DVD.  I couldn't help notice they were high and we had a new TV.

""Where do you keep getting TVs?"", I asked.

Jason winked at me.  ""Want some coke?"", he asked.

Kym ignored me as I opened the CD.  they were clumsy and most of the bags were still kind of open.  then she slid over for some lines.

""Hey where is the rest?"", asked Kym.  I stared at her but realized she meant the 2 bags in my boot.

""Oh I owed those to Jeff"", I lied casually.  her eyes narrowed.

Jason made a fake yawn and went to his room to sleep.  it was bullshit.  lately he had been shooting up.  so I waited an hour, slid into his room where the bastard was nodded out on his bed.  i took half a bag of coke, 2 smokes and $36.  he had no more H the bastard.

""Did he have anymore?"", asked Kym.

""Naw just cigarettes."", I said handing her one.   

the next day Kym was out of dope.  I acted sick too but did little bumps to keep me going until I could pick up my check from work.  she knew I was lying like I knew she stole from me.  needless to say it was an awkward morning.  Kym emitted this malevolent vibe that made me happy to go to work.

Kym and I took our checks to the Indian liquor store to cash and met Caesar outside.  his car smelled like green bud and cheap cologne but he had the goods.  4 bundles of joy for a repeat customer discounted deal of $175.  

""Where's Jason?"", asked Caesar.

""Maybe home?"", I shrugged. 

""Tell that lying sack of shit I'll be by in 15 after I make a stop.  I want to tell him something..."", smiled Caesar.

""Ok...Yeah. Sure.""

at home Jason was pissed we didn't have enough money to cover his mom's bundles as he was supposed to go over later with money.  

""We were sick and worked less hours this pay period right Kym?"", I said nudging her.

""Yup.  Flu."", she said walking past Jason to go get high.  She started drawing the cosmic whorls from Van Gogh's Starry Night on the foil. 

by my calculations Jason OWED me.  i fronted the last 2 Caesar purchases with my student loan check.  sure Jason got the last one but the TV was gone again and not to mention he owed last month's rent.  besides all the shit I stole from him when he passed out he still owed me at least $120.  when i pointed this out he shrugged.  He was more interested in what Kym was doing and generously offered to heat the foil for her.

""I got it!"", she snarled with the chopped Big Gulp straw dangling from her mouth like a smoke. 

""Oh and Caesar's coming by"", I warned him giving Kym a sideways glance.

""What?  Now?!  Fuck!"", said Jason who slipped into the hall closet, ""I'm not here OK?  Seriously don't tell him I'm here...""

Kym lit the foil as I inhaled.  I went to get a cigarette from Jason's pack as she expertly solo smoked another trail.  who fucking cares about Jason and his bullshit?  or that my girlfriend steals from me?  this life baby...this life is but a phase...time is short so let life be pleasurable...

and then:

POP! POP! POP!  

shots fired outside.  I yelped and dove to the floor.  Kym calmly continued to inhale heroin with insect like concentration as a car peeled off.  i could hear dark laughter far away.  i looked at my watch.  yeah about 15 minutes had passed since we saw Caesar.",1427569235.0

So I had (in my opinion)  a pretty bad pill habit for all of 2014, I was taking 8-10 hydro 10s a day. I recently moved and kicked it for 6 weeks,  now I've gone back to only doing them twice a month for the past 4 months.  Once I have my mind made up I'm pretty good at sticking to it,  especially after going through withdrawals ( I also was taking 2-4 mg of Xanax a day but don't even touch that anymore).

With that out of the way the guy I've bought my pills from offered my tar yesterday when I bought some percs and I said sure since he only had 60 bucks worth and I had 80 cash.  So now I have 2 points of tar and took all the percs (5 last night 1 this morning) and was wondering how long I should wait before I smoke some.  

I have never done H before but a couple friends said it isn't much different then pills (they snorted it) and was just wondering what I should expect if I break off like half a point and smoke it.  Tolerance wise I feel good off 2 percs alone and started to nod last night after my 5th one in 4 hours.  A long time ago I used to do math so I'm pretty confident in my foil abilities.  Anyway,  appreciate the input..... Happy nods! 

TL:DR bought pills and tar,  never done it and want to know how much half a point smoked will make me feel (with in reason,  I know there's no way to know the quality until I do it).

But I've been lurking here for a while, so I thought maybe this was a good place to share it. Honestly, I just needed to get this out. Thanks y'all, for taking the time to read my angsty junkie feelings. 

I'm sorry I went to your house this morning. My mom said that you're probably thankful, but I'm not,  because in all these years that I've known you, I've never had to see you like that and now it's all that I can think about. It's sad though, that I already kinda knew what was going on when you didn't answer the door. I'm sorry that I remembered where the spare key was, and that I thought it was okay to just let myself in. It wasn't. I expected the worst, or what I thought was the worst. I didn't expect you to be turning blue, struggling for air as I stood there in awe. I never expected that from you because YOU were always the one that had it together, the one who knew what he was doing when it came to this stuff. 

I didn't expect to see track marks on your arms, because I remember how when I was 14 and you took my virginity and gave me a bottle of Lortab 10's in exchange, you told me that shooting up was for junkies, and that we'd never be like that. For a long time, I believed you. For a long time, I didn't admit to myself that I had already crossed that line, a long time ago. And neither did you. 

I'm sorry that I called the ambulance,  but I didn't know what else to do. I could see your eyes, half opened, following me around the room as I screamed at the incompetent girl on the other end of the phone. I could see you try to speak, probably to tell me to mind my own damn business, to just get what I came for and leave. But I couldn't do that. I swore my allegiance to you 7 years ago, and, like it or not, we're still a team. A couple of junkie misfits that hate each other and ourselves almost as much as everyone else hates us. 

I'm sorry that I took the last of your dilaudid and your only new rig. You had already promised it to me, but I know now that you're probably going to need them over the next few days, while you try to figure out whether you actually meant to die or not. I hope you didn't. 


I typed this all out on my phone as I sat in the waiting room of the ER, trying to keep myself out of the nod so I could hear when they told me if he was going to be okay. His dad is with him now, and as far as I know,  he's stable. I've never seen someone so angry as he was when they narcanned him in the ambulance. Once again, thank you all for reading this!

I've been doing methadone daily for about 5 months, started as 30mg here and there to get off (before I just chipped with oxys and w/e I could get my hands on, not a daily user but off-and-on for a few days here and there) and in only 5 months I found myself up to 150mg a day, and not really feeling the high, which was the only reason I was buying the stuff.  I didn't turn to methadone because I was some hardcore addict ruining my life, only because it was cheap and it packed a punch.  What used to be cheap is now prohibitively expensive and comes with little or no reward.

I'm about 52 hours into it since my last dose, and just took about 120mg of loperamide.  Things looked pretty bleak this morning as I was feeling the WDs coming on fairly strong, but the lope turned things around 180.  I feel a little ""off' and certainly not high, but at this rate, if things don't take some drastic turn for the worse, it looks like getting through the 8 hour workday will be a breeze.

Anyone else have experience quitting methadone with little or no taper, and using only legal alternatives for tempering the withdrawal?  I have 2.2lb of Kratom on the way, should be here in a couple days.  In the past Kratom has helped especially for the PAWS I feel after a long run with opiates, but I don't really have any experience with it for the physical / acute phase.

This is the largest bag of hash I've ever seen and I'm very happy that on the 10th I'll be able to clean the last cheap Chinese trim machine before it is retired. I didn't even get to it when it was time to leave the other day.

D asks me if ill come help him find some scrap metal to get him back for the h and of course I agree. We dig in one dumpster when a cop pulls up. We get back in the car and he comes to take our licenses. We've got five grams of black, an eighth of bud and all our works stashed under the seats. Cop asks if we took anything not in the dumpster and we say no. He sees a cig burn on my pants from when I nodded a little before. About three different times he asks if we have drugs but finally lets us go. We head back to his place do a shot and that's when I realize I've got work in 30 minutes. Its 5 in the morning and I can't stand up straight.",1427683947.0

Perhaps we can even include some helpful practical information so that the less experienced users have a better idea of how to handle themselves in situations.

Please remember to not post any self-incriminating/ self-identifying information. Alter names, locations in your stories so that they are falsified from the truth thus keeping you relatively anonymous. 

As far as my history with law enforcement goes I've been arrested once for drugs.  That one time they caught me with a bundle of dope, several dimes of coke, and needles. Luckily it being my first offense I got off with probation and had to pay several hundred in court fines plus private attorney fees. As far as the actual arrest goes, I had just copped the dope/coke from the corner I had been going to for a few months straight. This corner was in one of the worst parts of a semi-large city on the east coast, the city as a whole isn't that prosperous although it does have some good things in the center. Anyway I left the hood and got on the highway to go back home to my area. On the highway I was speeding a bit and tailgating cause I was in a rush, although it was rush hour so I couldn't go that fast. Maybe 5-10 miles after i get on the highway from the hood, all of a sudden these unmarked dodge SUVs swarm up behind me with the red & blue lights on. Normally when a cop pulls you over it takes them 30 seconds sometimes even a minute to get out of their cars and walk up to your window. Well this time they were up to my window in like 10 seconds and they were all plainclothes detectives. They knew where I came from too. They told me they were gonna search me and my car but knowing my rights I told him, ""No I have to consent to that first."" He agreed, and said either you consent to search or we call K9 and if they pick up a scent we impound the car and get a search warrant. So I consented, they found the stuff and that's the story. Looking back I shouldn't have got on the highway directly from the hood, I should have driven over to the good part of the city and gotten on highway from there. Cause let's face it cops racial profile people all the time, if your white and driving through a hood/ghetto they're gonna assume your there for drugs.

""The what?""

""My patch, it was right here"" as I point to the kitchen drawer. 

""Oh, I threw it away""

Anger starts boiling up in my eyes and I let him have it. ""You're an idiot, you're good for nothing, living off of me, you ruin everything""

My husband stares at me in disbelief as he digs through the trash to find my precious chemical that will make the pain stop. 

""You know, you really need some professional help. I think you're bipolar"". I keep berating him and crying all at the same time as we dig through the trash I dumped on our new carpet of our new apartment. Ah the junkie life. I decided to get sober and I'm going through the painful wd. He doesn't know what I'm going through, he probably thinks I'm crazy. I'm not the person he married, he tells me. I will never forget what you just did, he let's me know. I slam the door and try to figure out where I went wrong. Why is no one listening to me? Does no one fucking care? I look over at my shot gun. I can make it stop. I can make the pain go away. I quickly realize how stupid my thoughts have become. It's a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Never heard that one before. I hate the person I have become. And I've had so much potential. All squandered, all my hopes and dreams went up my veins. All because of a temporary perfect moment. I'm disgusted at myself. And no this isn't a cry for help. It's only chemicals, I keep telling myself. Once you're done with the wd, you'll be back to normal. I truly hope that's the case. My life is a big lie. My own husband hates me. I keep working at the job I'm thankful I have. While I watch the women around me living off their husbands. It's the other way around in our household. I used to feel sorry for them. I'm beginning to think that they have a point. I got my independence and now I'm working for the big man, working until I die. No one will even remember my name. Why did I turn to dope? Because I hate my life. Oh but you can change it, it's not as easy as it sounds. There are a lot of factors preventing me from pursuing my dreams. Factors that I'd rather not discuss. So I've settled. Settled for a life with a loving, jobless, stay-at-home husband, no kids, nothing to call my own. Working a 9-5 job. Mediocre. You're stupid, you should be thankful for what you have. A lot of people have it way worse than you. And what, that's supposed to make me feel better? Is this my fate? Was I always predisposed to this lifestyle? 

""I found your patch"". Silence. I can't bare to face him. I'm too pissed off at myself for letting it get out of hand. I secretly wish I wouldn't wake up one day. So stupid. What a waste. But maybe, just maybe, this is all an illusion. An illusion that the opiates have casted over my eyes from prolonged use. I need to clear my head. Time will only tell. Until then, I'll keep dreaming.",1427680418.0

First tried it last December (chase the dragon style, not injected).  A bit later this year, I got some BTH and some #3.  In about a month I went through about 4 grams of very high quality H, smoking a little at least twice a day, sometimes as much as 6 times a day.  Small amounts, yeah, but enough to feel good and get shit done that's hard to do when I'm in pain and in no mood to get said shit done (that is, without opiates).  All of it smoked.  I ran out a little while ago, and I'm wondering what kind of withdrawal I might expect.  Right now, I feel shitty, a little bit of cold sweats, but nothing horrible after about 12 hours with nothing.  And of course cravings.  I might not be able to get anything else for a week.  Is my week going to be a hell, or is my doses/tolerance low enough that it won't get much worse than I feel now.  Wondering if I'll have to call in sick tomorrow.


The rest of this post is just a little background, no need to read it unless you're the curious type.  I'm new to heroin, but not new to opiates.  Back in the day when pods were sold on ebay, and a even a bit after they were banned from ebay, I had a daily habit of at least 7-10 ""Jumbo"" pods every day. Sometimes eaten plain if necessary, other times, ground up and eaten in yogurt.  After about 4 years of daily use I went cold turkey.  And I was in a pretty hellish place I'm sure a lot here can identify with.  A week of hard physical symptoms, you know 'em, and another month of terrible depression and cravings with occasional RLS, occasional cold sweats, and complete insomnia.  Basically... is that what I'm facing now?  Or is my tolerance low enough that I won't be debilitated tomorrow (and the next day) like I was when I cold turkied off the pods years ago.  I know it varies from person to person, but... any advice/info on how bad I've fucked up would be nice.

As a side note, I have some etizolam, which DOES seem to help the MINOR sickness I'm feeling right now.  Thanks.",1427676543.0

The Pain doc is OK with my chronic cannabis use, and is ok with my 2 mg of xanax every day. 
They started me on Tylenol/codeine like I asked for (trying to start small, make a good impression) and they offered me some flexaril which I turned down. 
2 weeks into my first 30 day supply of the codeine (120 mg/day), I called and said I needed to come back in because it wasn't lasting long enough. 
I walked out the very next day with an Rx for 2x 15 mg Morphine Sulfate ER, on top of the 120 mg of codeine per day. 
Now, obviously this is a good amount of drugs, and they've have zero problems prescribing them so far at all.
I'd prefer at least 60 mg of Morphine/day or to switch to Oxycodone/F-Patches. I would give up the extra codeine to have more of the time release. 
Am I asking for too much?

If so, why?","The answer is no for me, but I am wondering if it is for anyone else and how they feel about it. I tapered off an opiate prescription and occasionally use suboxone. I find that since my tolerance is relatively low, I can use an opiate (oxy for example) and still use suboxone at the most 6-8 hours after. So, with my tolerance, I can actually use suboxone during the day and then a full agonist at night. 

Suboxone is also long-lasting and very potent, and it's insanely cheap relative to how it takes away cravings, makes you feel ""clean"", and even feels a bit like a full agonist.

So suboxone isn't my DOC, but I just think it's extremely useful and still pleasant and very good at doing its job of tapering / jumping off when wanted. Especially with the low tolerance; if you can take .5mg and feel fine for the day, than a single 8mg film is a lot of doses.

There's also some nausea with suboxone, and I've heard people say that the more times you use it to wean off opiates, the less it works. And also, if you're not completely clean, there's always the worries about taking subs too early.

So, is suboxone anyone's favorite opioid? I'm interested to hear opinions from both sides-- the lovers and the haters, and from people who have more experience than me. So what do you think?",1427662029.0

Possible links to studies or articles discussing this topic?,"I've found nothing more helpful for my depression than opiates. Putting aside all the harm they cause, they provide me with energy, motivation, a feeling of serenity and calmness. I feel more confident and interested in my current tasks even more so than I do on stimulants. I've hardly had much luck with SSRI's and was wondering what the current opinion is on the subject among users and non-users. I'd obviously think something like buprenorphine would ideally be prescribed, as it lessens the abuse potential, but this does not factor in tolerance and physical dependency. Perhaps it could be used as the nuclear option for short periods of times like benzos (although many individuals are RX'd benzos far beyond the 4-6 week NIH guidelines). I've never taken suboxone so perhaps those who have can comment on its anti-depressant effects or this topic more generally. I do not think this would serve as a long-term solution and if implemented should include a regiment of psycho-therapy, healthy living, other medications, etc.. I also have found very little legitimate research on the subject, mainly speculative forum discussions. So cheers to more speculative banter.
