My worry is that my middle said when somebody was middling him he ask plug for his number and he wouldn't give it to him Cause he didnt wanna knock somebody elses hustle so he had to buy the dudes number from his middle. And note i dont mind looking out for somebody helping me out but im paying like 20 plus a point as much as im getting shorted. And my plug has just been out for like a month and another got shot so im kinda screwed. I know 2 other people that could middle but one doesnt use and the quality is usually lacking and he tries to charge stupid prices some times.

This dude was such a great friend to me growing up through my teenage years and I took care of him countless times while he was on pills nodding (I don't do any opiates whatsoever but I am an alcoholic and feel the pain of addiction), put him to bed so many times, cleaned his entire room, put away his huge bags of weed and never stole a single gram from him when he was into smoking and selling weed. But he overdosed in his house while his son watched and didn't understand what was happening. Died March 17th on his bathroom floor while his son watched.

Bill, we shared so many memories together, I know I didn't talk to you for a year and a half but the drugs got to be too much for me to handle. I didn't want to be apart of your problem and watch you kill yourself or me aid in it anyway. You were a smart fucking guy, you were on the straight and narrow getting clean and you struggled, I saw it in your face and eyes, it was your release and your escape from whatever thing you never told any of us. I miss you so much dude, I never expected THIS to happen to someone I admired so much and thought of a complete role model. We spent years together hanging out everyday until our paths didn't follow in the same direction anymore and I wanted no involvement in walking down that road.

I was ***so*** bored that I felt I just haddd to be off something, anything. Ironically enough, I was trying to hit my dab pen less. I was still high from the bud smoked during my ritualistic morning cyph, but I still found myself needing something stronger just to make it through the day.

I guess it's just good to always question shit, even the things you love. At first, I didn't realize how shitty this interaction was from an underlying sense, but now as I reflect I'm really troubled by what it says about my relationship with drugs.

Be mindful of your use if you identify as a recreational drug user (and be reallyreallyreally mindful if/when you decide you wanna tango with harder substances that have cons that very easily have cons that outweigh the pros if you're not careful.) Sorry, I know most of you know all of this stuff, as most people on here are much further into their opiate career, having experienced the binges you only get once in a lifetime. The kind you know you'll chase forever, either knowing or unknowing that you're just chasing a dragon you won't even touch. Every day, I read about people on here suffering from the worst of withdrawals that I cannot even begin to experience as I have not even gotten to that point myself. I have obtained a wealth of knowledge from this subreddit, and I am not only unbelievably grateful that all of you exist, but also appreciative to have this a resource as the black sheep of all my friends. Opioids are an untapped market at my school, and what sets me apart from my friends is that I know for a fact that heaven isn't a place, but quite literally another word for morphinian structured drugs. As a result, life has never been the same, so I've been using r/opiates ever since I stared into this proverbial abyss. I love every moderator, dope addict, activist, and ally on this subreddit, and even with those descriptors, I still haven't really hit all of unique members this community really has. So please, do not think I am trying to preach sobriety. I just hope that by being as candid as possible I can reach that stupid but really relatable sixteen year old kid that's searching for information on the pills he found in his mom's drawer. Just like him, I didn't always use to run away from my problems, but somewhere along the way I guess I decided to become a full time escape artist, equipped fast fingers, a fixation on being perpetually high, a numbness so deep, and more, all during the formative years of my adolescence!

&#x200B;

Sorry for the long post guys. Aside from the amphetamine induced verbosity, it's been a little over a year since I first tried opiates, so I think I'm more reflective than usual for whatever reason. It's been a strangely euphoric yet lonely and unnerving journey, and I wish I never took those norcos my friend offered junior year.

I wish I never stole my grandpa's unused hydrocodone script, finding them by chance after being generously given double A batteries that I needed fior my television remote. (I kid you fucking not yall he had them in a plastic bag with all of his double/triple/rechargeable batteries) Imagine my face when I saw the label, literally just glancing at it by chance.  Hydrocodone M366, about 175 7.5mg norcs in total between two bottles that were prescribed in 2014. I got a few to take home with my batteries, and that night tv seemed so much better. I tried to chip, but that went downhill. If I hadn't fucked over one of my closest friends by selling him an amount I feel uncomfortable revealing, I would have most likely fell into addiction's claws by now.

More recently, I finally was able to get my hands on the elusive oxycodone, straight from a friend's mom's script. No fent', baby! Before that I had already been using the occasional morphine pill, trashy tram, and of course my trusty dusty norcos sporadically whenever I could to hold me over. Nowadays, I leap at every opportunity to get high. Sometimes it's in the form of a quick, five finger discount and other times I ask my ~~sources,~~ I mean my friends who have loved ones with scripts to steal from their grammas and mommys who need analgesia much more than I do.

Let's be real, we've all read this headline a million times. Honor roll student turned junki√© inconsequential. Correction, inconsequential to everyone but anyone who ever cared.

It's clear to me what the right decision is, but right now I just want this honeymoon phase to be more like a lifetime. One of pinks, blues, and even the occasional Watson to take the edge off.

He was sick, drove to get some dope, shot some in his car, and started to make his way home. His heroin was cut with fent, he nodded, drove up onto the sidewalk, and then hit and killed 1 child and seriously injured 2 others. He got 30 years in prison because he couldn't wait an hour to drive to his house to get high.

Yes, withdrawing is one of the worst feelings in the world. But I'm sure that killing someone feels even worse, and I know for a fact that prison is worse too. I've only been in for a year and some change, and that was bad enough, but going in with a death weighing on your psyche, knowing that you will be an old fuck when you get out will make it so much worse, and that's if you even make it out. Health care in prisons is a joke, just getting old in there could be the death sentence.

We both work super long hours every single day (he gets a couple days off a week, I don't take days off at all) to pay the bills and pay for h. So trying to quit cold turkey has been super hard because we can't function at our jobs while withdrawing. My biggest problem is that I can't sleep while withdrawing and it gives me horrible anxiety to think about staying up for days feeling like absolute garbage. 

I tried to quit by taking a suboxone strip one day which took away some withdrawals for a few days but I still needed opiates in my system after the sub stopped working. So I went right back to it. (We don't have any hookup for subs anymore btw and don't have the resources for a suboxone/methadone clinic in our area.) 

My fiance has tried to quit before but he couldn't do it while I was still going out to pick up h, smoking it in the house, etc. And we can't stand to see each other sick so if one of us doesn't have h we'll share with each other. 

So we decided to try to taper off until we're down to less than .1 of h a day or every other day then quitting. We've already started tapering just because we don't really enjoy it anymore and are really only smoking enough to get well instead of getting high. We've gotten down to about .3 over the course of the day and plan to taper down to .2 over the weekend then hopefully get to a point a day next week. 

Has anyone tried this? Do yall have any advice for us? I've tried kratom before and it was the only thing that could put me to sleep while withdrawing, would that be a worthy investment (and how much do you think we should get)? ",1541126083.0

You might be a junky if:

You've ever went through a drive through and ordered a cup of water with no ice then asked for a spoon at the window when getting your water. ""Hey I don't tell you how to eat your water.""

You've ever gone into a random restaurant (like 1 of those little Mexican ones) and asked for a piece of aluminum foil.

If you have a preference of flavor of Gatorade to shoot up with when you can't get water. ""I like lemon lime bc it reminds me of dillys but hate orange bc it reminds me of subs.""

If your mom hides the spoons from the new set she bought to replace the last ones that ""disappeared"" and makes you leave collateral whenever you want to use one.

If when you have to have blood drawn you tell the nurse exactly where their best chance of success is. ""There's literally nowhere else but right here ma'am/sir.""

If the methadone clinic is like the bar cheers for you because people are the same and you wanna go where everyone knows your name. 

If someone says 1 of their friends ""has the blues"" and you immediately wonder how much they are instead of what they're sad about.

If during conversation someone says ""he's got a good point"" you think ""I wonder if he has extras I've been using mine for way too long"" instead of what they're right about. 

The smell of cleaning products your local gas station or the gas station near your plug uses in their bathroom sends you fiending bc you're used to only smelling it when you're about to do a shot.

You have ""novelty flowers/roses"" just laying around. (Several times I've given these to ex gfs or girls I've liked and they thought it really sweet and had no clue where they came from lmao)

The cashier at your local grocery store knows you as the guy/gal who always only buys aluminum foil, sour patch kids and sometimes chore boy.

You know exactly where you can sell gift cards for cash.

You've ever searched for ""roofing tar"" on craigslist.

Someone's talking about guns and says 12 gauge and you think ""holy shit that'd be like 1 of those little stirrers for coffee I couldn't use that.""

Instead of the high visibility shirts construction workers wear being ""safety orange"" or ""tang orange"" you think of it as ""rig cap orange"".

By the time you get down to your last or ""lucky"" cig in the pack you have to cut part of the filter off to be able to smoke it because you've been pinching pieces off of the end of it to use a filter when doing shots.

You fear going #2 bc it's been 2 weeks and you know its going to be excruciating. (TMI warning! When I was on methadone having to shit put the fear of God into me bc how bad it hurt and looked like someone poured Hawaiian punch in the toilet after I was done.)

You know every single pharmacy around that's 24 hour so you can get your script at 12:01 am on refill day.

You consider lean a ""pussy drug."" (I hate hearing people say oh that rapper has such a severe drug problem he's always drinking lean lol what are they 8 years old?)

The sound of pills shaking in a bottle (west virginia mating call lol) gets your attention over anything else. Like a shark smelling a drop of blood in millions of gallons of water you could hear it in a loud concert.

If you're a dude who's had to regularly fake orgasms. ""No baby I came also I promise. Lol.""

I take my subs sometimes but every now and then I shoot heroin (cause people will give it to me sometimes for free and when no one's giving it to me I can only afford it every now and then) and I also shoot meth, both I've been doing daily for awhile now. I know it sounds weird that I want to keep my suboxone prescription and I know this post will probably get a lot of hate for abusing the system but I really want to keep my prescription for a lot of different reasons, especially now that I won't have to pay the copay for the prescription with my new insurance plan. My sub prescriber gave me a piece of paper that I'm supposed to take with me to the urine test, on it it says ""10 drug urine test panel - test # (and then some numbers)"" and then ""Dx=Fll.20"" if that gives you any clue as to what type of urine test they'll be doing. What are my options for passing the test? Keep in mind that fake urine may be my best option bc I've been addicted to shooting meth every single day for the past 2 years to keep a normal wake/sleep cycle, otherwise all I do is sleep and I doubt I'll be able to wake up to ""take the test"" without it but I have a tight budget rn (I only have $38 to my name and I have a bill to pay coming up). Any ideas? What would you do or do you think I should do? Any fake urine recommendations that would be negative for everything but will pop for subs as if I'm taking the right dose (8mg suboxone/ 2mg naloxone twice daily)? Thanks!",1541115447.0

I must be one of the lucky ones, because I asked my Dr less than 3 weeks ago and their office already has the medication there and ready for me.

That said, I've been pretty excited to go in about 2 weeks for my injection. My only reservation/concern was actually that the 300mg might be TOO HIGH of a dose for me. I know I could be easily stable around ~4mg/day, and currently trying more around ~8mg...but I think starting the sublocade might be more like 16, and all day long.

Seems as though some of the blood plasma concentrations support that too, where average & low are close, but on high side some people have DOUBLE the bupe in their blood on sublocade vs 12mg subutex (and still significantly more than 24mg subutex).

This does not seem to bode well for tapering down.  But then I found this:

> **‚ÄúAfter steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. ‚Äú**

Wait, so...after I drop to the 100mg dose, if lets say after this initial 6 month approval is up I decide I want to come off...

I'm wondering if this means it may be possible to quit and allow the sublocade to slowly lower your blood plasma (because the depot doesn't fully dissolve in 30 days, more like 60 so I think you're still getting residual from previous months). 

Also the fact the say it will be detectable in plasma for TWELVE MONTHS or longer makes me especially question whether maybe these depots continue releasing a significantly lower dose for a much longer period than actually advertised.

So far, I've only found 1 person who had claimed to stopped--they were about 60 days post last 100mg shot and said they felt great. I wonder if withdrawal would still come, though. Or maybe the plasma reduces so slowly with this method that it makes coming off easy?

I don't know, and I think it probably needs to be studied significantly more.

**TL;DR - Invidor says ‚ÄúAfter steady-state has been achieved (4-6 months), patients discontinuing SUBLOCADE may have detectable plasma levels of buprenorphine for twelve months or longer. ‚Äú**

**WTF does that mean? How is it a depot that is supposedly releasing 30 days of meds going to still be in my blood a year later?** I just don't want to set myself up to be even extremely more dependent upon buprenorphine than I would be if I stuck to my pills. Guess my issue there is I need to actually take my meds to be efficacious, but yeah.",1541107489.0

I‚Äôve never taken an opioid, minus one time when I was 13 and needed surgery. So:

What are the doses that people commonly take? Is there a dose that you would advise against because it would feel too good and cause an instant problem? I have four pills of hydrocodone 10-325. I don‚Äôt even know what that number means. I have five pills of 2mg hydromorphone. I take Wellbutrin, 450 mg daily, and periodically take methylphenidate (as concerta). I would have no issues taking a break from the stim- I do that already. Overall, I‚Äôm very undecided about this and want to make an informed decision, including people‚Äôs personal experiences, not just stats about addiction. How do the two drugs match up (hydrocodone and hydropmorphone)? What is the difference in feeling? What are good drug combos- I have a 3 fl-oz bottle of delsym and a bunch of weed. I would intuitively avoid mixing stims and opioids- how dangerous is that? I would probably not avoid taking an opioid with weed, but I‚Äôm super unsure about DXM. Is it safe to mix hydrocodone or hydromorphone with XR DXM (delsym brand is pure DXM but it lasts like 12 hours)? Is it safe to mix those plus weed? Does combining an opioid with weed cause an increase in chance for addiction? Thanks for your responses, guys. If I pop anything here, I know I‚Äôm playing with fire, and I‚Äôm not going in without every precaution I can take. I‚Äôm leaning towards not taking them, but I kinda want to know... 

 But that‚Äôs how people begin awful spirals. So your anecdotes and experiences are going to help me do some risk/reward assessment here. I also wouldn‚Äôt take opioids like that more than once a season (I always make an exception for 1sts with a new substance, though- I have a ‚Äútest the waters‚Äù dose, but then I can actually have the full experience a week later. After that, though- it‚Äôs strict). I also only have limited quantities so that there‚Äôs extra incentive to save what is there for very unusual occasions.



TL;DR:

1st timer with opioids, have plenty of experience with other drugs. 

Hydrocodone- what‚Äôs the normal range of doses?
Hydromorphone- what‚Äôs the normal range of doses? How does it compare to hydrocodone? 

Combos:
Weed+either opioid= safe and enjoyable?
What about pure, extended release DXM+either opioid? All three? What about both opioids at once? All four? I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs a bad idea but I‚Äôm leaving no question unasked today lol.



Thanks guys! It‚Äôs impossible to say what would or would not have happened if you weren‚Äôt here for me to ask, but there‚Äôs an undeniable chance that your answers could keep me from ruining my life or worse. I think of myself as a smart guy, and I‚Äôm doing plenty of (internet) research on top of this, but I just want y‚Äôall to know that I‚Äôm sincerely grateful there‚Äôs a community here for me to ask.

Thank fuck I live 2 miles from the court house and 2 miles from my p.o. cuz I have to walk to everything. I just got out of jail cuz I missed a test I only sat 24hrs but still. The girl before me in court got a week in jail for a ""diluted"" drug screen. Like fuck.  I can continue all this for over a year or I can sit 9 months and be fuckin free. What would you do?

I was taking Suboxone at different doses for about 6 weeks. I was getting withdrawals 9 hours after my last strip.  Wanting to get off of them, I just stopped to see if I could handle it. 

So I'm on day five and still am not experiencing any WD symptoms. I saw a lot of people suggesting tapering because they're so bad but so far, for me, it's... nothing.

Like am I in the clear or am I just supposed to keep waiting?

I'm guessing I'm blacklisted because I decided to try Suboxone, thinking it might help me with my chronic pain (but apparently my doctor is a moron). I'm pretty pissed with myself about this but I just realized last night that I've also been manic for four months which explains a lot of my decisions, including Suboxone.

Edit: apparently spoke a tiny bit too soon because I'm now puking. Whelp. At least I assume my PM guy will give me something for the withdrawals or at least explain to me how to taper down properly. Hopefully. ",1541074681.0

I went to stay with my parents to try to start detoxing. It was only the first day and I still was using fent with plans to switch back to oxy the next day for a cpl days and then switch to subs after a day off from that.. Well on the first night at folks, still on fent, i suddenly started sweating profusely and having a bad panic attack so I left back to my place..went to the bathroom a couple of times (severely backed up but managed some) I also tried forcing some food into me since I have lost almost 15pounds from 140 recently.  I have not done any fent since I was there and took a blue at about 8pm, and now I'm here writing this at 8am, ive taken my 5th blue since then (so within 12 hours 150mg). I dont know what's happening but my heart is racing badly and I'm sweating profusely and dont feel very good. I can't see how I could be in withdrawl unless the fent is that much more overpowering than the 30s. I was taking about .5g every 24hr of fent thru nose).  I am just severely freaked out. No health insurance. I cant take to my girlfriend she will kill me if I tell her I switched to fentanyl back whenever.. so if anyone can talk to me tell me what they think is happening i would greatly appreciate that.

However I was too lazy to do it even though its only a 15 min walk... Then 20 mins after decideding I'm not going I get a text from him ""woooo, just found a box of valium and a box of pregabs!! Don't worry about the weed this will be enough to put me in a real party mood, just could have done with someone to get on it with that's all..."" that's the last I heard from him that day. Me and him always get together to do valium, pregabs and H, it's our weekly ritual. Sunday goes by, his phones off the whole day which is very very strange... No phone means no drugs which means something is defo wrong.. His gf phoned me up Sunday asking if I can over and check up on him (I have a key to the house since we are really really close.) I longed her off!!! I just had just finished a 12 hour shift and longed her off because I didn't wanna walk  35 mins to my mates then 40 mins home.. So I longed it off Sunday. Come Monday his girlfriend is now begging me to go over and check on him, we both know something is definitely wrong now, his girlfriend phoned round all hospitals and old bill stations he wasn't in any of them. So Monday night after finishing a 12 hour shift it is time to finally Check on the man, big Al . I have to bite the bullet and go check on Al, my best friend. He would do anything for me, anything I needed at all he was always there. Anyway I leave work and start the slowest walk ever, really , really hoping he is just shacked up with some girl and ignoring his girlfriend (this happened quite often when he would go off the radar.) 

I arrive at the house, all the lights are on that's a good sign!!! The stupid bastard is just super fucked up on valium and h, nothing new!!! I open up the door have a little look around, no one was there what a fucking relief!!

I bent down to pet one of the dogs and then I see it. My best friend , lying facedown in a pool of vomit... Smashed up face where he hit it on the way down, the the 2 small dogs jumping on him trying to wake him up.. The way he was laying just looked so uncomfortable, legs, arms and hands all twisted in a weird way It was the most horrible thing I have ever seen in my whole life...

They reckon he died at 3pm Saturday. If I had went over on Saturday when he text me and wasn't so lazy I know for a fact he would still be here now. He might have still went over yes but I would have been able to get him help and save him!!! I hate myself for being so fucking lazy.

Sorry I just had to rant because I'm a secret addict. Not many people In real life know I use so I can't talk about it to many people... He was my best friend, my using buddy, we done everything together!! I had to make the call to his girlfriend and their 14 year old daughter. Hardest thing I have ever done. ... Im gunna miss him so fucking much. I cannot get the sight of finding him out of my head. ",1541031995.0

I have been doing it everyday 1-3 times a day. I do rather large amounts.

&#x200B;

These past few weekends, I've been trying to get high off of oxycodone IR, and I keep having to up my dose. Keep in mind I haven't done any opioids besides kratom before. I have made it to 120 MG and all it gives me is a very¬†mild high. Is it my sensitivity to opioids doing this or tolerance? Its beyond crazy! $120 dollars for a mild high is such a waste of money. Does anyone know why this is happening and how to prevent it?? 120 mgs Is a ridiculous amount for someone whos never done real opioids before. I can probably up it to 200mg and still not nod/have a heavy high¬†at all.¬†No one told me it does this before starting kratom, if its infact the kratom doing this.¬†

You get high, you nod & get weird memories of events than never happened, not hallucinogenic but certainly dream like visions that seem to generate or implant vivid memories in your mind, that somehow initially feel real but you quickly realise are false. This nodding out can be quite pleasurable, rarely troubling, but the real pleasure for me is the comedown, after the dreamy visions pass there is an orgasmic tingle throughout my body, like that intense feeling when you bust a nut, only much less intense but much longer lasting.

**Lyrica** 100mg caps x 90 (RLS, Ive used this before and it killed alot of the body aches and issues and  


**Tizanidine** 4mg pills x 90 (This is for muscle relaxant and I hear it acts on the same receptors as Clonidine a2 adrenergic)  


**Clonazepam** 2mg tabs x 5 (I'm planning on using this for sleep aid)

**Xanax Alprazolam** 4mg bars x2 (I could get more of these but they proved very potent sleep inducers)  


I don't plan on using the benzos for much longer than 3ish days thru the worst of the WD  


other OTC Meds I have are **Loperamide** for the runs also it does help with cravings ime

I also have **Melatonin** \+ **5HTP** for sleep and mood booster  


anything else you guys might recommend? Also I have no idea how much I'm supposed to dose  the Lyrica I know i can dose upto 400mg a day maybe 200 thru out the day and 200 at bed time. but the other meds I'm not sure about

The kid is as dirty and desperate as any of the pigeons in the street.


He holds both dirty palms out and open while he does this sort of dance like a whirling dervish or something and chants his petitions for spare change or cigarettes to anyone and everyone walking by. No one pays attention. His voice has taken on a sour wino rasp, moving toward but still short of the way freight riders croak like bullfrogs when they speak. A vulgar and putrid aura of dishonesty and cigarette ash hangs on him. His face is dirty. Several bits of black scab stick out of the skin on his nose, and a few wispy hairs hang from his chin and lip. I stand on the sidewalk under the overhang in front of those ticket booths or whatever they are.

‚ÄúHey, kid!‚Äù 

He continues his dance. A woman pinches a few coins between her fingertips and hands them to him. He smiles at her. She tries a smile but her lip stick quivers, betraying her revulsion. 

‚ÄúHey, kid!‚Äù I yell out a little louder this time. 

He looks around. I pull that soft paper pack of Winston‚Äôs from my pocket and finger one loose and step out to give it to him. 

‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I say. 

‚ÄúHey. Thanks, man!‚Äù

He puts it in his mouth and pulls out a lighter and pulls in the smoke. It takes him a moment to realize that he knows me.

‚ÄúHey. You‚Äôre Randy C. Huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù We shake. His hand is dirty in mine. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up? Haven‚Äôt seen you since‚Ä¶ since the meeting. I think. That‚Äôs right. I never made it to that game.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy moms found a foil in my room.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were smoking it?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shoot though right?‚Äù

‚ÄúUnless I just relapsed or am trying to keep it together or something, but yeah. See?‚Äù
He holds out the crook of his arm revealing the holes in his arm, pierced places where he tries to chase away his pain. I nod. My own are hidden away under the new button up I‚Äôm wearing. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre you trying to get into?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sick, man.‚Äù He‚Äôs not lying. Watery mucus runs from each nostril. His pupils stretch to hide the brown of his irises. ‚ÄúGot like seven bucks and some change.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhere you gonna pick up?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to get anything for less than 20.‚Äù Those dirty fingers move up to his face and pull the hair hanging over his eyes. He pulls his head back like he just realized something. ‚ÄúOh man. Are you getting high?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt say anything.

‚ÄúYou are, huh?‚Äù He says. His voice too loud. He laughs. ‚ÄúWhat you got?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got what I need, bro. I‚Äôm asking you what you‚Äôre trying to do and who you‚Äôre going to see about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this stuff going around. White powder. You taste it, yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Guess there‚Äôs this dude they‚Äôre calling the Vonnegut or something. He‚Äôs the one brought it around. It‚Äôs been all over the place.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you gonna do if you only got seven bucks?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy ex-sister-in-law strips later tonight.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, she‚Äôll be looking to pick up something big. Usually does. I get it for her. She always breaks me off fat.‚Äù

‚ÄúI got something at my place. I‚Äôm headed home now. If you follow me, I‚Äôll get you well and even throw you some threads, bro. You‚Äôre looking pretty hard up.‚Äù

He looks at the stains and dirt on the front of his shirt as if this is news. There are a few holes from embers in the fabric and a black streak of soot wiped from a hot metal spoon. ‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, bro. I‚Äôll help you out.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan! You‚Äôre a lifesaver, bro.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt trip. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù

I just moved to a new big city in central south USA. From some advice I found on here I downloaded whisper and after a few scammers/weirdos I found a plug. The plug was about 20 min away from my house, in order for them to help me out I needed to;

1. Pick them up (20 min)
2. Drive them to the house back on my side of town (20 min)
3. Drive them back home (20 min)
4. Give them $10 and then drive myself back home (20 min)

The house is only a couple minutes from where I live. The plug said it was open 24/7 and during the 5min I was there (stayed in the car) I saw two other people walk up. I also asked the plug to get me $80 but Im guessing I got about half of that. How bad of an idea would it be for me to just go back to the house by myself? I could either walk up or ask one of the other people around the area what the deal is?

So I've been mostly clean for almost a year, but have taken subs maybe 5 or 10 times when I just need to scratch the itch and feel high. The other day I was dumpstering the grocery store and found a bunch of hummus, so I kept digging and found a bag full of empty pill bottles! I've been in the middle of nowhere for the last month working so I guess maybe it's such a small town that the pharmacy is lenient about how they dispose of medical stuff? Anyway I threw that shit in the car and brought it home to go thru it, and sure enough found a bottle of lean (codeine and guaifenesin) with like 100mg left in it. Y'all know I poured a LaCroix (lol) in it and shook it up for a sec and drank that in about two sips. I don't remember feeling too much but I did have trouble cumming later that night so it definitely did something, lol. 


Also, how many of y'all are mostly clean and no longer addicted to your DoC but get shit for still getting high occasionally? I was really addicted to dope for years, I say I have ten months of clean time even tho I've abused subs a bit and done one shot in that time. Some people say I should restart every time I relapse a little bit but I honestly don't think that's fair and it's really complicated to explain; it's easier to just say I have ten months clean? I guess I could say ""I have ten months since I was strung out"" but I haven't been actually strung for a couple years, I was just chipping... I still count that as using tho cause I just lived my life for the weekend so I could get high anyway. I don't go to meetings or anything, idk. ",1541015620.0

Taking Tram and being able to not increase your tolerance towards the others is a nice surprise!",1541012052.0

First of all let me say hello to all the great people of r/opiates. Who I assume are all very attractive as well as intelligent. I hope you all are at least well if not high. Sober by choice falls in with well and bravo on maintaining your sobriety. The cops havent got ol lobster yet though there was a close encounter where I literally had to run lol. It's very touching that some of you have said you're up for writing me and throwing a little money on my books when I inevitably get locked up for this probation violation bullshit. They'll rubber band my claws and throw ol lobster in the lobster tank with all the other poor unfortunate crustaceans. But that's for another time and until then I'm going to get high and enjoy my freedom. Self care . . . I'm treatin meee right. Hell yea, I'm gonna beee alright. 

So I fucked up yesterday and didn't get any $ so I didn't get any dope so yesterday evening I was sick and getting sicker. My good friend gave me a tiny bit of dope she'd got. It was a miniscule amount but enough to get me ok. I was even able to sleep some on and off. This morning when I forced myself up out of my sleeping bag where I'd been tossing and turning for a couple of hours trying in vain to fall back asleep I knew I had to get dope. Which requires money. I tried everything I could think of and eventually resorted to pan handling. I was sick as fuck and desperately needing dope. Every step I took felt so very draining. I could only walk for like 5 minutes until I had to sit down and rest. I walked a couple miles like this and after like 3 hours I had enough money to get enough dope to get myself well. Not high, but well. 


I took the bus to the stop nearest my plug and set out walking the nearly 3 miles to his house praying he'd be home. I don't have phone service right now so I'm that asshole who just shows up and that's what I did. The walk was excruciating. I was already so drained that I didn't think I could make it but I did. He turned out to be home and he only took 45 fucking minutes weighing out my little bit of dope. After getting my shit I had to walk all the way back to the bus stop to do my shot in the bathroom of the Exxon bc he was being shitty and wouldn't let me do it at his house. He has had like 5 people die there from overdoses but still, it was a shit move. I go into the bathroom and open my little tiny folded up piece of paper, so very truly happy that relief was imminent, aaand it's all fucking coke. He mixed up my order and gave me girl instead of boy. I was crushed. The trek there and back had felt like climbing mount Everest to dopesick me and it was all for nothing. Absolutely soul crushing. I had only 1 option available to me which was to walk there and back again. Fuck! It was like waking up on Xmas morning to find out Xmas was cancelled. I was somewhat mad but more than anything I was just crushed. My spirit was nearly destroyed looking at that pearly white cocaine. Fml. I walked back to his house to get him to trade it out. After the old, greedy 1 handed dope man took his sweet time weighing the coke to make sure I hadn't pinched some he weighed out the boy to replace it with. No lie this man sometimes takes an hour to weigh a point. I couldn't make it take that long no matter what I did. He uses a little scoop to get a tiny bit and ever so gingerly taps it out onto the scale. But he's always so high he nods and takes too long between scoops and the scale turns off and he has to start all over. And god help you if you rush him. He'll also start talking and telling stories and get side trekked from the task at hand. I go back and forth between thinking he's incredibly high and just incompetent and that's why it takes such an insane amount of time and thinking he's lonely and knows he can get away with whatever if someone needs dope so he can tell his jokes and stories to a captive audience. I can't decide why he takes so very long but he does. It's way worse for attractive female customers. When the girl who gave me enough dope to get by yesterday goes he makes it take like 2 hours. I went with her last week and he no joke made weighing a half gram take an hour and 45 min. I'm positive it's bc she's hot and he wants to spend time with her. Anyway I got my shit and sat down right there and did my shot in his living room. I was like this is happening and you'll have to physically stop me to prevent it. He wasn't happy about it but oh well. 

I just went back a 2nd time to get enough for the morning but he took so damn long I missed the last bus. Also the bus must have came a little early but still, him taking a fucking hour screwed me. Now I'm stuck at this Exxon and have to walk nearly 7 miles to get where I'm staying. I don't know if I can do it. I didn't wear socks today bc I was so sick I didn't feel like finding some and putting them on and I've already walked so much today that my feet hurt and my legs are sore. Also due to no socks I'm getting a gnarly blister on my heel so if I walk 7 miles it's going to be absurdly excruciating. And to top it all off in a moment of weakness knowing I'd be walking 7 miles or huddling somewhere all night trying to keep warm I went ahead and did my morning shot now so I could at least be high tonight. Damned present-me always fucking over poor poor future-me. 

How are all of you lovely people doing? I know there's many out there with real problems. Not like my whiny bullshit lol but I hope you are all doing great and had much better day than me since my problems are all petty and trivial and of my own making. Damn present-me. He and past-me must really have it out for future-me. 


Tldr: walked super far dopesick to the plugs house then back to the gas station bathroom to discover plug gave me girl instead of boy. Lots of walking and bitching. Now stranded at gas station. Now literally shivering in a parking lot. ",1540958482.0

Been a steady hydro/oxy user for the last year, anywhere from 80-120mg once a day. Havent really gotten over 2 weeks sober but have decided ill be taking a tolerance break at least until the holidays. So Im already on my 2nd day of being clean, so far only thing thats bothered me is mild anxiety which Ive been using xanax in mild doses for. My question is today will be my 2nd and last day of using a benzo to help with sleep and anxiety. My doc has prescribed me as much trazodone as I want since I dont really want to be using benzos on a regular basis. Im wondering if anyone has had any experience with trazadone. Also interested in dosing as Ill most likely only be using it for sleep and maybe some anxiety when it gets bad. Might also be worth mentioning that my trouble sleeping isnt so much falling asleep as it is staying asleep.

It keeps me awake at night. And I've visited many doctors who all say everything is completely fine and it's anxiety. I can't believe how hard it is to get someone to have an open mind (Well i can, because otherwise i would have listened and stopped abusing drugs along time ago). I've found a few articles showing studies on how opiates can affect respiratory control. I mean it makes sense, right? Something that can completely stop us from breathing could possibly change how it feels to breath right? Well this situation has left me with no relief, since I'm trying to just maintain on suboxone, which doesn't feel right anyways, and I get no other relief from anything ever.

I met a guy outside of a jail downtown a couple weeks after being here and managed to bring it up in conversation that I was new here and in need of a buzz so he made a few phone calls on my phone and set me up to meet his friend. Well his friend was sketched by the situation (which I dont blame him. Friend calls and says he met a girl looking for heroin right outside the jail while he's waiting to get picked up for his work release) and set me up with someone else. I end up meeting this guy at a gas station down the road from my house, he's like 6'5"", long, greasy, slicked back hair, missing most of his bottom teeth, long, dirty nails, his shirt was tight but the neck was all stretched out, and he's driving this beautiful BMW. At this point I can't figure out if he's the plug or not. He tells me I have a beautiful smile and takes $10 off the price of the bag, cool. I make the transaction quick and get back to my car to take a better look at the stuff (I posted a picture of it in a post when I got it) I'd never seen dope like that before so I was skeptical. I did a bump and turns out it was amazing shit. So the next day I call this guy again, he doesnt know where to get any more. He's not the plug unfortunately, he's a tweaker and would not stop hitting on me and making weird comments, I'm a lesbian but if I were into men it would NOT be him. So I go back to the jail and wait for my friend to come out and see if we can try again. Well there's a rehab next to this jail and dude's got an ex who goes there court ordered. He introduces us and I tell her if she can help me I will buy her some. We go and meet her dude and he does the drive by thing, so I don't have to worry about her pinching it or anything because it goes straight from his hand to mine, amazing. I start doing this same thing about every other day, pick her up, meet her dude, break her off some, drop her off. It works so well any time I'm in need she's ready to go. I didn't mind going through a middle man (woman) this way bc his shit is so good, cheap, I dont shoot any more, and I make pretty good money so it's fine giving her a couple points. Well last week my little friend was taking a long time to text back and wasn't making much sense when she would text back. Finally met up with her and she's so barred out she cant keep her eyes open, her head up, nothing! She would call him then forget where he said to meet. She would fall asleep while the phone was ringing. She kept mumbling, he couldn't understand her, I was dealing with her for 4 hours before we finally got to meet this guy! It was the day before my birthday... I just wanted to get my shit and get fucked up all night. Since then she has been barred out and completely impossible to work anything out. The dude I met at the jail ended up getting busted bringing crystal in and got locked up, no more work release. So I call ol' tweaky and see if he can help. Which to my surprise, he does, but it's fuckin garbage dope. Spent 50 and did it all in about 2 hours. The next day I try again, spend 100, it's different shit but equally as garbage as the last. So now I'm screwed until home girl comes back to reality. I get so jealous when I see everyone posting about their plugs and shit because this is the first time in my using career I've been loaded with money but no connect! If you've read this far I appreciate you, wondering if anyone has any advice about finding a plug??? No more middle men. I'm visiting home this weekend and gonna pay my old guy a visit, love him, but after that I'm back to drys-ville. Ughhhh I dream of times where we have drug apps similar to dating apps, where we can be matched with our perfect plug. Thanks for reading. I love this sub. ",1540935407.0

9splyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9splyo/shame_and_regret/,5,https://redd.it/9splyo,Minuted,Shame and regret...,"So I used to post here a lot a few years ago. Since I got on buprenorphine I've posted less. But recently, I was given weekly pick ups. At first it wasn't too bad but slowly as my dose was reduced I found myself using an extra days worth here and there leaving myself short. This culminated recently in me using a bit of anything I could to get through to my pickup, morphine, codeine etc. But the other day I used heroin for the first time in a few years. I'm either too honest or stupid to hide this fact from my loved ones so now I feel like shit making them worry. I don't inject, and even smoking I always smoke a small amount first but even buying off of UK vendors on the darknet there's still that chance there could be that little bit of fentanyl that could end you. Just feel awful making my mum worry about me like that. I'm pretty honest with her about when I feel suicidal but I always tell her that I'd never do it. And I never would, not while she's alive. but this feels different, like I've actively caused her to fear for my life, as dramatic as that sounds. People tend to associate heroin with death. And not without reason.

To top it off, I messaged my key worker at the clinic being honest about how I've been struggling and using on top of my buprenorphine. Haven't heard back but I usually hear from him by tomorrow so there's a good chance they'll just kick me off of the program altogether. I'm really hoping they'll take into account my (admittedly belated) honesty and allow me to go back onto daily pick ups at a higher dose if I promise to engage with their services a bit more. (anyone in the UK have any experience with this? I go to spectrum CGL, won't post the town though)

No real point to this post, just shame and regret I guess. But I just can't imagine living without opiates. whether it's a daily maintenance dose or an occasional binge they're one of the few things that I find myself looking forward to.

I had been taking 15mg + 50mg today and I really like the feeling with this dose, however it's not super strong (not the aim, I'm doing it at work) and I would like to take it a bit further tonight at home and make some music.

I was planning of taking 20mg and I want to potentiate the fuck out of this dose but not be completely floored. 

The idea was to have a beer or two, 50mg (100 maybe ?) dph as well as 40/50mg of dxm before taking the oxy. 

I need to somewhat be able to function, but not too much since I'm comfortable with making music (guitar/synth), I don't need to think about it so much, but I need to be able to move lol. I do have a tolerance but it's kind of low, last time doing opiate was 2 months ago. 

What would you do if you were me ? Take everything ? Just dph/oxy/beer or dxm/oxy/beer ? 

Thanks !

Basically I‚Äôve had it with Psychiatry being accepted as part of the Medical Institution. My Doc, an ‚Äòaddiction specialist‚Äô, has a particularly egregious racket. Generally for 15minute appointments he‚Äôs charging $300(luckily with insurance I only pay like $80, but insurance ain‚Äôt free), where a script is written that will need to be rewritten in a months time(sometimes 6,8 weeks, sometimes 2weeks).

Shit that turned into a rant.. I‚Äôm highly doubtful that any of these docs would greenlight say jumping off MMT for doc monitored short-term maintenance with a short acting opiate like oxy or morphine, in order to attempt a 5 day detox and an opiate-free life.. particularly free of the dr‚Äôs, scripts and liquid handcuffs.. but any known cases may bolster my case, or any other ways to kick it y‚Äôall might‚Äôve heard of besides methadone/bupe maintenance ??

anyway when i spend time down there i tend to be pretty generous and try to help people out whenever possible, sometimes i'll throw them a bag or two for walking with me a few blocks so i don't have to cop on my own (i'm a girl) but it's not always drugs - sometimes they just want a hot dog or a slice of pizza or just a bottle of water. one time a guy got his backpack stolen when he ODed so i got him a bunch of cheap white t-shirts at the dollar store. i wonder sometimes whether i come across as a pushover, but honestly i've actually never been hassled down there in all my months and years of hanging around, not even once; i like to think that's my junkie karma keeping my bank balance in the black. i have had money taken from me on two occasions, but i've also evaded some *reeeeeally* potentially serious fuckups due almost entirely to random luck and chance. one time i was briefly detained by several police officers with a full 6 bundles tucked into my purse (like trafficking-level quantity) and walked away scot free, for example. it's stuff like that that makes me glad i practice good karma economics. anyway does this resonate with anyone or am i a pushover after all?...lol. just thinkin out loud.",1540884403.0

I was on opiates, IV, for about ten years straight. It was all day, every day. Around 4 years ago I made up my mind to stop my use. My addiction had went through the roof, some days I was doing up to 800 mg of oxy a day... So, the last four years I've been on sub. During this time I've steered clear of relationships, cause I just didn't feel like I could be good for anyone.

So, present day, I'm seeing a woman. A fucking beautiful, smart, sexy woman who makes me feel fucking human. I've curbed my sub use down to 2 mg a day, which I'd think is low... My problem is I have zero sex drive. I wanna have sex with her, but my body just isn't working.

My question to you all, the males, is have any of you dealt with this? What steps should or could I take to help this. I'm over my mental connection to pills and H, but I still use sub as a crutch, and I'm tired of it. I want to live. I want to make this person as happy as they make me. So, any of you have any help or advice?

I tried coming off sub, which did lead to me getting too excited, but I got so sick after a few days I lost all strength and was dry heaving. I figured jumping off 2 mg would have been easier... But I learned. I can get hard. I wake up with erections. I get hard with her, but I just can't keep it at a full level. She's been totally cool and caring with this all, but right now I want this fixed. So any advice from others who may have had the same issue would be greatly appreciated...

These are the instructions for shooting

* After preparing your shot, set the needle aside and wait to inject.
* Add about 1 milliliter (about 1/4 of a teaspoon) of clean water into the spoon or cooker.
* Hold the blue end of the test strip and insert the other end into the liquid.
* Allow the liquid to travel up the strip into the test area. (This takes less than 30 seconds.)

I don't talk to the original friend anymore but I still hang with this guy. He is really the closest thing I have to a friend even though he is a pain in my ass most of the time. I was never good at being social or making friends and the few I had   
I drove away years ago. 

&#x200B;

I spent a year out of town kinda dealing with some shit with my ex. I went back to the city last summer and started hanging out with my best bud again. The first day we hung out last summer (2017) he offered me a Percocet as he was taking one while we were walking down the street. 7.5mg of oxycodone and it got me a real good buzz. Within a week I asked him to grab me a few next time he picks up. Within a month I was calling his plug directly to get roxy 30's. That's how I got into this game in the first place. 

&#x200B;

I managed to chip until spring of this year when some personal shit got me doing dope and poppin' pills on the regs.

&#x200B;

Last week I am dealing with some shit and my best bud texts me that he has a line on 100 Pink 10mg Roxy from someone who doesn't know their worth and doesn't want to sell them like that anyway.  So this guy agrees to sell us 100 10mg Roxies for $600. I'm busy with shit so I can't go meet my buddy to do the deal and we didn't need to both be there so I did what I've done dozens of times before and I just send him the $ on an app on the phone.  He hits me up after said things go off without any issues and he's got them waiting.  

&#x200B;

He is then being weird all week and always has an excuse as to why he can't meet up. This dude is like that sometimes and claimed he was busy with work which does happen for him sometimes so I'm annoyed but it's fine. I also stop rationing what I got on me because I know I got 100 waiting for me. 

&#x200B;

This past Friday his phone is off and stays off all weekend. I get nervous something bad happened so I hit up his girl and she tells me that he is fine and they just stayed in all weekend. 

&#x200B;

So now I know that I just got burned by my best friend. I know he made the purchase and I know he got those pills but he is just keeping them.

&#x200B;

I mean getting burned sucks enough and getting burned by your best friend really sucks but the worst thing is thinking you have shit when you don't. Now I'm stuck with whatever stash I have on me right now of maybe 10 pinks. I could have gotten more over the weekend but I didn't because I gave my re-up money to my boy. Now my plug is dry on those so I can't get anymore. 

&#x200B;

The thing I hate the most is the hustle and the constant worrying about running out.   Like even if my buddy didn't steal my shit and I got those 100 I would feel good about it for a few days but after like 3 days I would have been starting to worry about copping more again. 

&#x200B;

It's extra hard cause I kicked dope and now I really don't want anything to do with dope. I don't even like the feeling of dope. It just makes me tired and feel like I'm going to die. I'm hooked on the sorta speedy high of oxy. Oxy gives you that really clean high and it energizes me, makes me wanna talk about be social and do shit. I don't get that from dope. 

&#x200B;

I feel like you can only get your hands on some dope if you need it bad enough. It's not hard to scrape up like 50 bucks and grab yourself a few hits of dope. Plus even if money ain't an issue, there is always a dboy somewhere who is good. By me, especially after recent laws about prescriptions passed, once one of my plugs says he has some it's a race against the clock to get as many as you can before he sells out. 

&#x200B;

Fuck. I never post rants on reddit but this shit warranted it. I don't know what the fuck I can do to feel better about this shit. 

&#x200B;

I got a script for 2mg Subs waiting for me at the pharmacy. I called my doctor this afternoon to ask for some more once I realized my stash was almost gone and I got no way of getting more right now.  Luckily my doctor is cool and he called the script into the pharmacy within like an hour of me leaving a voicemail. Looks like I may be kickin' the OC's because of this so at least I got subs to make that process easier. 

&#x200B;

Hell, maybe I'll get off these things and go clean because of this and then my best friend robbing me will turn into the best thing that happened to me.  Or maybe I'll grab a couple grams of dirty ECP and dig myself into a heavy hole. It will be interesting to see how this plays out. 

&#x200B;

I really wish I liked smoking weed. My life would be so much easier if I could just smoke some pot and be chill. I hate weed though. I don't even drink anymore. Of course the only vice I have is incredibly expensive and difficult to obtain as well as it being dangerous and my tolerance seems to be going up every day. I'm so jealous of my friends who just love smoking weed.

Suboxone is a colder, harder version of the done high but is still very good.

Even prefer them over Hydro because they last SO long and feel like a mood stabilizer that keeps you stable in a uplifted way, not a mediocre ""flat"" like lithium.  Does anyone feel that suboxone/Methadone acts like a mood stabilizer? I'm not bi polar, but I'm diagnosed with ADHD, I do find myself between being happy and depressed, getting angry, pissed off, kicking shit around the house but on either of these I feel stable and nothing can make me sad or angry.

I don't plan on using these long term and only sparingly. For 4 years so I've managed to use Opiates sparingly 3-4 times a month. It is VERY tough and tempting but as I've seen family rip their life apart, lose their jobs over opiates that shit keeps my use in check. When I tried Hydro the first time in my life, I used for a week straight and then abruptly stopped and felt extremely uncomfortable, that was mild withdrawal, I caught myself quick and stayed off Opiates for 6 full months and use very sparingly.

I know, I'll probably get shit for this, but I like codeine. It's one of the weakest opiates out there but I don't have access to other sources, therefore I used to get codeine and nod every week or so. It's nothing spectacular, but it made me feel calmer, less anxious and super relaxed.

It's not the first time they do this. A few years ago DXM (cough suppressant with dissociative effects) became prescription-only too. DXM helped me cope with the shit I was going through at that time. I would still go to the pharma occasionally and basically humiliate myself by begging for cough pills. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.

I fucking hate all this hypocrisy. People blame junkies and addicts for doing drugs but they don't think that maybe drugs is the only thing that numbs their pain and makes them feel good. ""Opioid epidemic"" my ass. There's no epidemic, only bad laws. Had they legalized drugs, people wouldn't OD on some shit they bought that was laced with fent. Had they cared about their people, the governments wouldn't punish people by sending them to prisons for drug possession. 

So yeah, you're a ""junkie"" for doing drugs but what else should you do when you basically have to fake your death in front of your doctor in order to get a Rx? Doctors often don't care about you or your pain and they refuse to prescribe you pills (at least that's how things are in my country...if you really want a script, be ready to pretend you're dying, because they don't take you seriously until shit gets out of hand). So you go home and crawl in your bed crippled by anxiety because your psych refused to prescribe you Xanax.  Other people start doing opiates because of pain (physical or emotional) and because doctors wouldn't prescribe them pain medication. I remember reading about Kurt Cobain and how he numbed his stomach pain with heroin because nothing else helped.  Some people turn to hard drugs because of this simple reason: PAIN. I believe that meds and substances generally should be more available.

Yet, they want to take everything from us. Soon enough you won't be able to get any meds anymore unless you have a script. Because of this, an increasing number of people start doing drugs. Because they're in pain, they're not being taken seriously, and there's no alternative for them. Why do I need to humiliate myself for a script? Why not allow people to CHOOSE freely what substances they want to ingest?

So Friday night one of my friends got some ""oxy"" that turned out to be at least fentanyl, actually carfent is more likely since he needed 6 shots of narcan at the hospital to bring him back. 

He got these pills up in Canada that are well known, I used to test the pills he gets with my fent strips but I guess he didn't call me this time because he thought they were real since they were from the same person he usually gets from. 


They were the supedol pills up here in Canada, the 20mg football pills with SS on one side with a V score. 

He snorted a full one and fell out in his car, his girlfriend tried hitting him with narcan and it didn't work so she rushed him to the hospital. He ended up needing 6 shots of narcan to wake him up. The doctors said he was almost certainly going to have some brain damage but fortunately he is doing okay and didn't suffer any brain damage. 

He isn't a heavy user of opiates and only does oxy when he can find it and definitely doesn't do it every single day and has never done heroin or anything like that so he didn't have a big tolerance to opiates. 


Fucking scary shit, stay safe everyone and TEST YOUR PILLS!!!!!! he showed me the pills after he got out of the hospital and they look absolutely identical to the real thing, same weight same shape same lettering which is crazy. Sure enough I tested it and it's positive for fentanyl. ",1540832522.0

Im not going to read my past posts because it's too painful. As the title states this October marks two years clean. I never thought I would make it, I had gotten to the point in my addiction that I was accepting it was going to kill me. 10 long years. Unfortunately I was traumatized into getting clean, I had someone very close to me OD and pass. But to be honest that probably wouldn't have been enough, the detectives knocking at my door and the threat of 'drug induced homicide' really drove it home. It was a nightmare. The Wd's went by so easily because I was in such grief and fear.  

You guys, can I just tell you the simple pleasure of going to the grocery store, buying ingredients with my own money and making a dinner in my own kitchen. Everytime it just fills me with such happiness. Not everything in my life is great but it is miles better from where I was. I just have to look at my phone to be reminded. Before my pictures consisted of...nothing really. Maybe a pic of the westside to show someone where I was at or a handful of pills. Now it's selfies bc I feel pretty, things I've made, painted and cooked, dinners out with friends and family, my baby nephew. Can I just say how fucking thankful I am that I was clean when he was born. I don't even want to think of what it would be like if I was using. I go on vacations now, I go camping! I've also picked up some intense hobbies I've gotten very good at, mostly miniature making but also painting. I poured myself into it at the beginning to take my mind off things and have made some things I'm really proud of. 

I think that being a junkie has really put some perspective in my life that not a lot of people have. It take A LOT to phase me. Cause really, what could be worse then what I've gone through already. I used to wake up in a groundhogs day nightmare of dope sickness and the struggle every morning. Nothing is worse then that. And I'm just happy to be alive! I don't need lots of money or fancy things, I'm content. I have a decent job, I have my own place, boyfriend and family that loves me. What else do I need? And most amazing of all that 'need' is gone, that fucking hunger that would not shut the fuck up before is just...gone. I forget what it feels like, I don't even care. I hope you guys make it, I hope you see what the other side is like and that monster on your back is really not a monster at all. This was kind of long so thanks for reading if you did!

I always felt my body super weak, and just didn‚Äôt have energy throughout the day. My chest would feel tight and stressed out. Like most people I would just eat junk food, that usually consists of my diet. Pizza and fried foods. To get to the point, I bought a magic bullet and started juicing. It‚Äôs hard to eat vegetables when you barely have an appetite for anything else, let alone when they should be raw for optimal nutrition. I started juicing, and since my first juice it‚Äôs been like night and day. My body was obviously begging for nutrition, and it was stressed out not having the proper tools to repair itself. Just drinking a juice in the morning filled with raw vegetables takes care of a lot of my nutritional needs for the day, and there‚Äôs no chewing involved so it‚Äôs not a pain in the ass to do. The boost it gives me actually provides me with euphoria, not feeling like shit and feeling normal is euphoric to me. So here‚Äôs what you do. I mostly always use brocali, kale, cucumber and carrots as the main ingredient. Then I add whatever fruit you want. I try to switch it up as much as I can. You can use any frees you like those are just the ones I‚Äôm using now, since it‚Äôs hard to buy and store a million types of greens. But the more you mix it up and (usually) the nastier the vegetable, the healthier you‚Äôll feel. I‚Äôll take this as many times as I can. My appetite is way up and I can just eat the junk I want now, knowing I got my greens in for the day. Anyways I hope this helps, I feel amazing. ",1540820311.0

I'm ready to be done with this shit (no pun intended...next sentence you'll get it).. I just spent the past 20 minutes crying while pushing an elephant sized turd out of my body. I'm not going to miss that.

I just did a lovely .5 shot. I've got  .1 left and about 30bags to scrape. I'd toss em if I was mentally strong enough but I'm not there yet - plus I'm just as addicted to the process as I am the dope itself. Whether it is setting up a regular shot, preparing cottons, or scraping bags I enjoy my routine, it is momentary peace in the chaos that I've been drowning myself in. There is great satisfaction in getting approximately .2 from scraping bags that just can't be beat - or perhaps the high from that come up is, it remains to be seen. 

I'm late on all my bills - a first for me, I've always made sure bills were taken care of before I'd pick up more, apparently not this go around. Seeing all the late notices is the smack in the face I've been needing, to tell me I can't keep chasing this fleeting high that solves nothing.  She is such a sweet high though, I sure am gonna miss it.

 I've got to remind myself it isnt worth it. It's not worth being broke (woohoo $1.97 in my bank account), the bruises, jabbings & collapsed veins, the opi-rage that is making me snippy at my family for zero reason, the lung cancer that is most likely developing bc menthols are the peanut butter to heroins' jelly, the inability to orgasm even tho dj diddles over here had it down to a science to achieve in under 2 mins - which contributes to my lack of sleep (bc I'll be masterbating for an hour plus before I finally give up bc my hands are tired), the lack of motivation towards seeking a real/fulfilling job/career.  ITS NOT WORTH IT.  It was fun until it wasn't. 

I want me back. I'd like to put the opiate version of me to sleep once and for all. I want to feel emotions again and to learn proper coping skills  and become mentally stronger. I cant keep trying to do everything on my own... I've tried that and look where it has put me. 

The next few days are going to be tough. If any of you have read this far and have some moments to spare the next couple of days please leave comment or even DM me with tips and advice - this little lady is sure going to need it!

Over the next few months we became best friends, I would call you late at night when I was stoned or drunk out of my mind because man, I thought alchohalism was bad. I needed someone to talk to and you were there, we cried together, we smoked together ( through Skype but it was like you were right next to me ) I never got the chance to meet you in person before you passed but fuck I promised I would come see you when you got out of jail but I couldnt afford it. The last time we texted we talked about how we needed to video call again soon and I told you about my H habit I acquired. You talked with me for awhile about it and I knew I could really trust you. I know, as well as anyone else the only reason you robbed those stores were because you were sick. That doesnt make it okay but I fucking get it and I wish I could tell you that now. 

You committed suicide Sept 6th. Or atleast that's when I found out. There was so much more I wish I could have told you. You were only 19, so young to take your own life, to make such a decision and now it's too late, I cant be that person I needed to be for you. I'm sorry I didnt understand sooner, that I didnt get to come see you when you got released, that I sent so few letters to you while you were locked. 



I love you man, you were an amazing person fighting a fucked up battle in your head and I should have been there more but I didnt know how. 
I miss you so much and just wish I could hear your voice one more time.

Are you addicted ? How does opiates affect your life ?

Are you miserable, with no job, no money, crashing at friend's houses ?

Do you have a normal life, with a steady job, maybe a family, living happily with no problem ?

I know it must be much more complicated than that. But all I've read and seen on opiates are horror stories, and you guys seems so ""okay"" about it, almost looks like a hobbie in a way.

Fast forward ten years of sporadic use, sometimes months of nothing, then in the last year or two taking codeine once a week, I currently need 180mg to get that same feeling. I'm not feeling wds during the week, only feel a bit shit the day after, but if I take 30mg codeine now I wouldn't notice a thing. 

What's going on here? It's clearly out of my system 2 days after taking it and I've never done it more than once a week so why over time has my system slowly risen to a point where I need 6x more than I did ten years ago to get a similar buzz?

Am I just more used to it, and want a stronger high each time? Or has my constitution changed so it actually needs more codeine to feel the same thing? And if I totally stop codeine now will I feel any kind of withdrawals or just go on as normal?

I can't work out why codeine works differently from say, paracetamol, in that the same amount doesn't work on the same way each time, despite not taking it all that often.

I read a lot of experience from other people and a lot of people write that they feel very euphoric and also from really smaller dosage that I take. So why don‚Äôt I feel it that strong ? The pills are legit. Got it in blister.

He seems really grateful and since i've been doing this the bags have gotten a little fatter, but more important than that he's starting to be really honest with me, for example he tells me exactly where he's at or how long it's going to be, or he'll actually say he's waiting to reup instead of telling me he has it but his car is not starting or whatever stupid dboy lies they come up with to keep us on the hook.

When I started Suboxone, I was using at least a bundle of heroin per day. I was traveling hours on the subway, back and forth through NYC to cop dope. I sold pretty much everything of value I had. 

I was always behind on rent and on the verge of being evicted. I have a significant other who does not use drugs. Somehow we always found a way to not get evicted. Just typing the word evicted freaks me out. I have nightmares about it. 

I would get a job in retail, work there for a couple months and get fired or quit over something stupid. Wash, rinse, repeat. I was seeing a ‚Äòtherapist‚Äô with whom I would cop drugs. I was contemplating using a needle for the first time. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt get to using a needle, but it was as bad as you can get without the needle. 

Now, I‚Äôm still on Suboxone. I‚Äôm also prescribed Klonopin. I started smoking crack while on Suboxone just so I could get High on *something*. I see my doctor every couple months. I‚Äôm rx‚Äôd 12mg of Suboxone. I fucking hate it and I run out early every month. I‚Äôm just as depressed as ever. I sort of put on a mask as being functional to my doctor but I don‚Äôt think he buys it. I‚Äôm not working and I haven‚Äôt had a full time job since March 2017. My partner has worked very hard and has a really good job that can support us both very comfortably. I am so grateful for my partner who has stuck by me since before I started using heroin. 

I don‚Äôt regret getting on Suboxone but it didn‚Äôt do much for me except allow me to not be sick between when I get money for dope. 

I use at least once every week, maybe every 2 weeks. I smoke crack every time I use heroin. I miss getting high off heroin but now I‚Äôm mostly just throwing my money away. I‚Äôll use heroin and Suboxone together. As well as crack/powder cocaine and benzos. Maybe I‚Äôm just a crackhead now, I don‚Äôt know. 

Suboxone is definitely not the answer to anything. It‚Äôs like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. But I know if I wasn‚Äôt on some sort of Opioid replacement therapy I would still be using heroin daily.

Nothing changes if nothing changes, right? 

I don‚Äôt really know what the point of this post is. Can anyone relate? I feel stagnant. I can‚Äôt summon the will to be sober. I still want to get high. Something sick in my brain thinks I can just get high and have no consequences. I mean I have been very lucky that I haven‚Äôt had too many close calls. Knock wood, I haven‚Äôt been arrested. I haven‚Äôt overdosed. I haven‚Äôt been raped or robbed (aside from getting burnt for like $20 here and there). I don‚Äôt WANT consequences. 

I just want to want to be sober but I can‚Äôt find it inside me. Deep down I know I want to get high. I can‚Äôt give up control and go to rehab. I can‚Äôt lower my Suboxone dose. I don‚Äôt want to lower my klonopin dose although I‚Äôve been forced to. I don‚Äôt want to go to therapy. I don‚Äôt want to take my psych meds. I want to do what I want to do when I want to do it even though my way has gotten me literally nowhere. Is that the disease talking? Is it a character flaw? I am just tired and sad and anxious and restless and lonely and depressed and apathetic and pathetic.

I guess I should be thankful that they lasted this long as I'm going on 12 years of varying degrees of IV drug abuse. It's a shame I didn't use simple harm reduction techniques more often, because I used to have veins that every junkie dreams about. I could always hit multiple sites the first try without fail, even hitting in the dark if necessary by only using my sense of touch. Those days are forever gone and as such I've been exploring alternative injection sites. 


Not gonna lie the other day I was admiring my white ass junkie thighs in the mirror and noticed that they have a bunch of thick veins that are clearly visible and appear to run near the surface of the skin on the top side of the thigh. Of course I immediately got curious and had to see if they would work for my special purpose. Sure enough I hit on the first try and registered a plume of red that only a virgin vein can produce. Everything went as it should without any surprises. I hesitate however because I've never heard of anybody using this area to inject their drugs. So, I thought I would ask my fellow professional junkies a few questions re: harm reduction before I get too excited... 


Is it even common to have visible veins on your thighs? Does anyone else hit in this area? Are there any additional risks of hitting here? Why haven't I heard of people using this area? 


I know people use the femoral vein - usually as a last resort - and know that there are many risks that go along with that. Of course this is not what I am asking.

I had a plan to go but first I did some researche online and it did not look good, apparenly opioid analgesics were nearly impossible to get even for doctors. And after reading blog after blog I came to the conclusion that there was no Oxycontin or Diladid or anything that was not Tramadol or Tylex (codeine and acetomenophen).

So fast foward to today, I decided to look into the issue again and figure out exactly what the situation in Mexico was in regards to availability of opioid analgesics, prescribing, practises, and available products. 
Well as it turns out narcotic pain pills are available, but the level of red tape and regulatuons are draconian. Ill explain but first here is a list of available narcotic pain medications in Mexico.

Hydromorphone 2mg in 100 ct bottles
Methadone 5, 10, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Oxycodone IR 5, 10, 20, & 40mg 100ct bottles
Percocet 5/325 100ct bottles
Oxycontin 10, 20, & 40mg 30ct boxes
Codeine 30/500 

Thats it, thats all thats available there, but these are rarely prescribed even to terminally ill people due to the oppressive regulation. For a doctor to be able to prescribe these he has to,

1. have a special licence he has to seek himself that is only available in the state capitals of their residing state, and they need to fill out loads of beaurocractic forms (shit) to be able to get it. And the process can take months.

2. They have to get special prescription with barcodes that can only be obtained in the city capital. So the doctor has to drive in person to pick these up in the state capital and can only get so many, so if he runs out he has to drive all the way to the capitol.

3. Only licensed pharmacies can dispense these medications and they also have to go through alot of beaurocratic bullshit to get a license so alot of pharmacies do not even bother and dont carry them.

These are just a few of the hoops physicians in Mexico have to go through so many doctors dont even bother. The problem got so bad that Human Rights Watch did an investigation and found terminally ill patients were dying without proper pain management. Even in the ER morpine was on short supply. And in pharmacies, since very few doctors dont have licenses, scripts are minimal so pharmacies dont have a financial incentive to keep stock and there are routine shortages leaving people to suffer. The drug violence had supred this attitude, but I dont see how making these medications nearly impossible to get helps in any way.

Uncovering this really pissed me off, and I give these mexican politicians a stern üñïFuckYouüñï alot of these cunts are corrupt af and they have the nerve to place such restrictions pain medication. And to add insult to injury, politicians and their friends and family have no trouble getting these medications. Now I understand why my 2 of my uncles in Mexico died in pain from lung cancer and why my grandmother cannot get proper pain treatment despite having debilitating arthritis. 

Looking at this I am just thankful I live in the US.

If she bumps the sub up to 4 mg will she be able to cover the withdrawal?

Or will benzos help more than usual? Ie, she avoids them lately, but i think if she combined with subs, she would see a difference and appreciate them a lot if they have the kind of synergy i used to get. She didn't use them to get on subs time because they didn't help when she cold turkeyed at the last rehab. I know they used to have a great synergy for me but that was for getting high.

I started giving her a tiny piece every day because she was always sick daily, which was me not long ago so i felt bad, and at first it was like it gave her a free pass to use without getting sick, even if she skipped a dose of dope. Now I'm worried since she appears to be getting sick at the 24 hr mark since last dope usage, even though she is taking the sub.

He said they just started testing for Kratom and he was pissed I didn't tell him I was taking it. Been taking it for 20 months. It's fucking nuts. Anyone else been booted out for Kratom use?

Was in jail for three months and then stayed clean for about a month or so after i got out till i relapsed. At least im working this time instead of stealing from stores. Anyway i just got some h that was ordered from the darknet, according to my friendly neighborhood drug dealer its from the UK.  To my understanding, uk dope is usually in the freebase form, and ideally should be converted to hydrochloride or some other acidic form for best absorption when snorting or shooting, i thankfully stopped shooting but do need to snort it. My acquaintance smokes it out of a bola and said that this batch doesnt smoke as well as the last batch which pulled awesome clouds when i tried it, so he started doing bumps instead. I did a small line, about half the size i normally do and i can definitely feel it a bit but am wondering if i could get some input from people who have dealt with uk h before. Thanks and happy nodz.  

Edit: So i did a bit bigger line, still not as big as normal, but i swear that it tasted like baking soda at first, like it has that basic, non acidic taste. The stuff i usually get smells like straight    
Vinegar with a dash of something sweet or whatever is the cut. I can definitely feel it but its not as gsood of a body high, much more in the head..
Considering trying putting it in a bit of water with some kind of acidity and snorting it.

&#x200B;

However, I do still have periods that I would like to be able to relax from my thoughts and although i've come to understand that really getting high via any substance is really just fooling myself, i've chosen that a less destructive high will satisfy my impulses.

&#x200B;

i'm a veteran of Gabapentin use and know tolerance builds fast, however I can't seem to pinpoint when that tolerance has been abated. I was taking 1600mg daily up until 4 days ago and have stopped cold turkey. As for Opiates the last time I used anything besides Subuxone was 2 weeks ago. I detoxed down 10,8,6,4,2 MGS in the day following and since then i've been trying to stretch a 4 MG daily dose as many hours as I can. I don't want to take Subuxone at all but I do need to keep it in my system to satisfy my Subuxone Doc as I would like to stockup about 100 or so strips should I go back to my old ways.

I ask because I have access to both, right now, fire as fuck but I cannot decide which I like better. I smoke btw. No shooting any more for me.

&#x200B;

So far, its like the gunpowder is that reddish brown powder rocks that break down to straight powder we call it "" The Huff"" and then I have the #3 which is like crazy looking hold on peep this.

&#x200B;

**The Number 3 (2G maybe like a tad over weight idk didnt weigh it really)**  [https://imgur.com/QJah5Wk](https://imgur.com/QJah5Wk)

  
THe number 3 melts to complete liquid and leaves NOthing behind its crazy ill take pics of trails later but ya whats your opinions what would you buy again more of ? Like should I cop more of the #3 or more of the GP? I know its like #3 is synthd differently so diff alkaloids and I am used to smoking fire gunpowder such as what you see here usually not as good as this current batch because I got a better connect recent hipefully that connect stays around but thats not my point or question my question is which would you want more of?

&#x200B;

Be honest and also how yall doin I have not been on here in a long time 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But yea seriously its like I cannot seem to figure out which is better, I mean I know I am the one with the drugs so I should know but ... idk. Its like the #3 burns completely diff from the gunpowder tar; the gunpowder tar melts to a beautifully clean golden trail and tastes so amazing vinegary and all that smells insane; and shatters to straight powder when needed and is sniffable without water. 

&#x200B;

The #3 though, it like slides super insane fast speeds and then its like it leaves a clearish trail behind like almost no trail and then last night I got so fuckin noddy that I woke up at like 9ish AM in th emiddle of my room on my floor all confused and my head hurt so bad I must've nodded out fell forward off my bed rolled and smacked my forehead off something cuz I got a black and blue huge lump! Shit.

&#x200B;

Oh, I pay like 300 for the 4 grams of that GP and then I paid like 90 bucks for 2 grams of that #3 and the #3 was an import its not from the united states but I sure am. Its the first time I ever got #3 bec in the united states we dont see #3. This came directly from a place right next to afghanistan, no further details can be given and no I cannot help you get it and no I am not your plug or anyones plug I am a fucking heroin addict.

2) in terms of amount, I‚Äôve read that some people get benefit/feel good after railing 2 or 4mg instead of their normal dose. Is this urban legend or reality (I think due to norbuprenorphine is what I‚Äôve read)

They gave me a reason to live when I started using - I'm not a new user -, and that's how I got hooked. I'm aware addiction brings tolerance, which is an issue, but I can handle it in a few ways.  I know addiction requires money to maintain it, and that's not an issue really. I know the depression and anxiety comes back worse when you go thru wds, but I never go through withdrawals. I'm always mantaining.

You see, one guy on my Facebook killed himself. He just got tired and threw himself in front of a train. Almost everyday on my Facebook feed there are news about him, and what he did - and *why* he did - reminds me of myself. I know how it feels like to be so tired and unwilling to do anything other than lying in bed grieving and lamenting all day. I know how it feels like to feel lost and without any purpose in life. I know how it is to feel so miserable and distressed that you don't just want to kill yourself, you know you will and you'll plan carefully how to do it. I know how it feels like to be desperate 24/7.

I know how it feels like, and it feels hella awful. I don't want to feel like that ever again. I love not feeling that way anymore. It's been so long since the last time I felt that way, thanks to opioids. I don't want to come back to that state of mind ever again. I know that ""that state of mind"" is how I naturally am in my sober state, but I just kept using drugs everyday, every morning, every afternoon, every evening, so I'm under the effects of narcotics all the time - and thus, don't want to die.

And I don't need to get fucked up all day either. Sometimes I take 160mg of oxycodone, sometimes I take 10mg. Obviously 160mg is way better, but 10mg is enough to keep me from wanting to kill myself. So even with all the down sides of addiction, for me it's still way better than being sober. It keeps me alive and functional enough to work. It gives me a reason to live and make money - to do opioids. Whereas before using them I couldn't even get out of bed to do anything and just wished I was dead. Being an addict is better than being dead. At least in my case it was.

I can't recommend using opioids for depression, because that usually doesn't work. But in my case, if I am alive today and have any kind of peace, I own it to narcotics. It will be worse on the long term? I'm already on the long term in a sense! But will it be worse on the even more long term? I don't think it will, but if anything goes wrong, I can always kill myself with a gun or a strong shot of dope.

Just out of curiosity, I decided to check it out. You see, last December I abandoned a car in a business complex‚Äôs parking lot. It is a piece of crap. The insurance, inspection and registration were all about to expire, the brakes literally had stopped working (I was driving for a few days with nothing but an e-brake... in nor‚Äôeaster storm conditions), and then the battery decided to also stop working. Since I had only purchased the car for $300 over a year beforehand, it was time to just let it die as spending even a penny on fixing it would be too much. It‚Äôs a really nice neighborhood full of yuppies, so I figured it would last a week at most without getting towed, and basically put it out of my mind. To my surprise, just about ELEVEN MONTHS later and it‚Äôs still there. Expired tags and all. Absolutely shocked, I pulled up beside it to see if anything useful was left in there. Oops, I had actually left the doors unlocked. Not much chance of there being a damn thing in there. Regardless, I rifled through the glove compartment, only to find an entire bottle (120 ct) of 8mg dilaudid pills.

&#x200B;

I've been feeling badly for 2+ days. 1 day ago I went to a place that does IV hydration/toradol/zofran that was a nurse practitioner. Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. 

No pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.

At this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.

Like I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, ""what am I supposed to do here?!"" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like ""we don't want to lead you back to drugs."" I was just like again, ""what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?"" He eventually conceded and was all ""fine one dose."" 

& I got it.

Plus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own.

I have been taking 4 oxy 30's daily since I tore my acl in early August. Recently I've switched to about a qtr gram of fentanyl (snorting) which I've done for about 4 to 5 days now. Today I switched back to the percs. I've wasted so much money since the injury that I had to switch to fentanyl at times as its 5x cheaper than blues are.. anyway: I just wanted to get this off my chest and start recovering. My plan was to start taking subs whenever possible and then wean myself off. I only have an 8 mg tablet and an 8mg strip (16 mg total) to complete this task with which I think is more than enough. I also have about 800 mg of tramadol sitting around that I could use as well. My plan was to take tramadol for the first day or two that I dont take fent or perc with, maybe take 2 every 6 hours the first couple days, until I run out of tram, then take the suboxone. My reasoning is that I never can make it through the first 24 hours without getting more percs or fent.. I'm hoping the tram will hold me over through the 24 hours or more that I will need in order to take suboxone. I worry however that the suboxone could send me into precipitated WD when taken AFTER taking the tramadol. Any support or ideas from anyone or information about this would be greatly appreciated. I live with me GF but she isn't a user and she doesnt understand much when it comes to this so I don't feel like I have much backup TBH.. so any support would be very kind and taken affectionately.

so recently, every time i do a shot of tar and crystal i catch myself rotating/gyrating, subconsciously, from the hips on down. if I'm standing i keep catching myself just pivoting my torso left to right, rhythmically, especially while using the phone out doing something similar... but when I'm laying down on my back, i keep catching myself gyrating my hips, and when I'm really flying, i rotate the SHIT out of my ankles.. just little toe circles pivoting at the ankle, both simultaneously. 

i understand the concept of being geeked and fidgeting about (jawing, all that typical geekshit), but this is way more specific, odd, new to me and almost guaranteed by my subconscious if I'm not on my guard.

there's a strange satisfaction in it i can only really compare to pressing ur finger into ur gums in a sore area... the harder muscle contractions of the soleus/gastrocnemius for the ankles and the lower back fibers, guessing lower traps, have begun to yield some weird sensation that my body/mind seeks out pretty much automatically when i combine the two substances. this is after years of this not ever happening.....

i only have one question about it tho... DOES ANYONE ELSE CATCH THEMSELF DOING THIS WHILE HIGH OFF H AND SPEED? im not worried or anything, just can't deny some strange shit is going on w me and its so much more exact than just being methy and hyperactive and tweeky..

I mean what are the success rates of these places - 1%? 

The only useful thing I've found about rehab is that it prevents me from going out and scoring. But I could a random guy on craigslist $50 to lock me in his basement and get the same result. 

I hate the constant fucking 12 step/AA horseshit shoved down my throat. No offense if 12 steps/AA has helped anyone here - but they seem like a cult or at the very least a very unhealthy community to me. So much of it is pseudo-science, where are the scientific studies proving its efficacy? Oh wait, there aren't any. In fact, there's only studies to the contrary.

Half the retards in rehab think that they have suddenly found the love of their lives in the meth addict chick who they met 7 days before - they hook it up after rehab only to find that she stole your debit card and memorized your pin and down you're $2000 down the hole. 

The boredom - at the rehab I went to only about half of the day (12 hours) was actually structured into going to meetings, or having in house group counseling. The rest of it was spent - staring at walls. Real fucking helpful for an addict going through dopesickness to stare at a fucking white wall for half the day - I'm sure that that's not going to make them start thinking about drugs. 

The stupid ass random rules. One at my rehab was no sugar - soda and candies were banned. Because apparently sugar makes people hyper. Yeah - they actually believed that pseudo-scientific bullshit. That's not all to the pseudo-science - they believed that saunas would release ""toxins"" and help us detox. Meh, OK, lots of people believe in toxins and stuff. But they also asked us on induction if we thought that we had psychic powers - no joke. Also - no electronics - i.e. no laptops or phones or other computer devices, no video game consoles. The only entertainment we had was a TV and a selection of movies pre-screened to not be ""triggering."" I had already watched all of them before the first week was done. 

Smoking was banned, but people smuggled them in. I don't smoke and I hate tobacco but the horribleness of it made me join them in smoking a cigarette. Sometimes it was a quarter cig someone dropped on the sidewalk that we picked up and sneaked away when we were being driven to meetings. 

The holier-than-thou attitudes. People acting like clean time was like what level you were at on an RPG, and higher levels would constantly look down on lower levels as inferior. If you smoked a joint you were suddenly back at zero days - which in that case might as well say fuck it and score some heroin. IMO, weed shouldn't even count as not being sober - in fact weed helps tremendously in helping me stay sober. But to the AA/NA/rehab folks, nope, weed is just another drug and if you smoke it you're risking your ""sobriety.""

Most of the counselors did not even have even a BS in psychology or social work or anything relevant - most of them were former addicts with hardly a high school diploma, most likely working for minimum wage. But boy did they always know more than you!!!

The whole forced interactions. The whole connections to one another - you talk about how you'll keep in touch once you're out and be life-long sober friends - except deep down we all know it's bullshit but we act like it's not. You know that at least 75% of the people there don't even give a shit about their sobriety - they are there to appease their probation officer, or their parents or wife, or some are even doing it to delude themselves - but secretly they are counting down the days until they can get out and score before probably even the first 24 hours are up. And they're jonesing because they know their tolerance have lowered, so they'll be able to get **super fucked up.**

Every day you are supposed to act like this rehab is the best thing ever, that you're having an awesome time, that the people you're meeting are awesome - while in reality you're counting down each day and can't wait until you can leave these obnoxious twats and never thinking about them ever again. 

I'm sorry but before I spend fucking $7,000 to stay in some bullshit ""rehab"" for 30 days - fuck - just lock me up in some room and provide me with food, water, and a bed and I'll pay you $50. 

I don't mean to shit on people who have actually had positive outcomes from rehab - but 99% of people I've met who ""graduate"" rehab seem like they've gotten absolutely nothing out of it except a tolerance break. 

Sorry to be so negative, but there *has* to be a better, more scientific method toward treating addiction. Like imagine if any other disease had a ""treatment"" with only a 1% success rate. The person proposing the treatment would be laughed out of the building.

Currently trying to get clean on my own so sorry if I'm pissy, but getting clean from my own home with no stupid ass restrictions or forced interactions or other bullshit is 100 times better than going to a suck ass rehab. The only thing I wish I had is for someone to lock me up so that I literally couldn't leave. And if I wanted that, I could get it for far cheaper than rehab.

Just felt like ranting - I spent $7K on a 30-day stay at a rehab and honestly I just feel gyped in the end. And this was one of the better rehabs. I can't imagine what the Scientology or super Christian rehabs are like.",1540615282.0

At lunch time, I texted Church Girl and told her that I was home.  Coincidentally, she was home from work also and she asked me to come over because she was down in the dumps too. 

It was a beautiful Autumn day. You know the type - bright sunshine and a little nip in the air. We walked her dogs and came upon a farmers market. We bought fresh fruit and vegetables and cakes. We got back to her apartment and she offered to cook dinner. I said NO. because she was feeling down and I offered to take her out to eat. She picked the place, Roy Roger's, which was  thoughtful of my money. 

We watched TV and she sat next to me and after a while, she snuggled up to me and it felt good and right and so so nice and I knew that she had to be feeling the vibe.  She told me that she ""really, really"" (her words) liked me.  An hour or so later she said that she was sleepy and - here it comes - she asked me if I wanted to stay over and instantly - BOING - little jimmy was standing at attention.  Stay with me now. 

Church Girl went back into her bedroom and bathroom. I knew that girls like to ""freshen up"" beforehand. She came out and gave me a new tooth brush and a towel and wash clothe so I could ""freshen up"" too.  So this is IT, I am thinking, game on! 

And then, SHE STARTS TO MAKE-UP THE COUCH with a sheet and blanket and asked me if I like feather pillows.  NOOOOO NOOOO NOOOO. 

Then she fuc.. I mean tucked me in (her words) with a sweet and delicious FRENCH KISS. And that's it - a super sexy kiss and blue balls like I've never had before.  I left early in the morning and went to work.

Why me? Any other guy would have been balls deep, but not me. What a fucking loser and I am more depressed than ever.

Sorry in advance for rambling, but I'm in a rare good mood and am looking for some of your thoughts on a situation. 

I've been working really hard at a regular, professional job for about six months now. In spite of the fact that I still go do what I have to so that I can get high every single night, the job has actually been going awesome, and I already earned a promotion. 

My boss's boss approached me today about getting me a company phone. He mentioned that a lot of people here get rid of their personal phones out of a lack of need for two (including himself) and that I'm welcome to use the one they give me for both purposes if I feel like it; there's no policy in place about what the phones are and aren't for. 

Obviously it would be great to drop my cell phone bill and my shitty old phone and have some extra cash for dope every month, and I am 100% certain that this is not the kind of company where anyone is making a concerted effort to ""catch"" employees behaving badly....they hired me before my felony arrests were expunged and no one even mentioned it, I've done heroin while driving their company car (so no cameras or anything like that), and they don't drug test at all, like...ever (thank GOD). Basically living the dream here folks.

Still, it gives me pause to consider exposing myself in such a blatant and ongoing way to that much hypothetical risk, especially since I sorta dabble on both ends of the dope game occasionally. Not in a serious way or anything, but like....texts are sent back and forth regularly that would not end well for me if somebody started snooping around. 

TL;DR: On a scale from 1 to 10, approximately howwwww stupid would it be to ditch my personal cell and use a company phone to handle my opiate-related business in addition to my business-related business? Thanks in advance for any thoughts on the matter!",1540597382.0

I seen a post about ""your craziest schemes"" with tons of good stories and thought yall might get a kick out of my uncles failed plot","My uncle has been in and out of jail/prison and scheming for pills ever since he was a young teen.

So at the time of this story my grandma worked at a casino. 
My uncle somehow got hired on the construction crew that was doing some work on the casino.

He managed to get a key or code to my grandmas register that had the chips you turn in for money.
Well he started scheming with another construction worker and they worked out a spot on the roof that was right above her register.

They came back in the middle of the night, cut a hole in the roof, and that guy lowered my uncle down with a pulley system they rigged up, like a fucking spy movie or some shit. He then cleaned her register out. 

Well of course grandma was heavily investigated since only her register was emptied and it was obvious that the thief had a key or code or whatever. 

They started looking into the construction workers and knew it was him right away since he was her son and has a shitload of prior robbery/burglary charges. 

Im not sure how much time he got for that but he only seems to do 2-3 years at a time then hes out for a few months before getting busted and doing another 2-3 years lol. 


Another time he had his friend walk into a bowling alley, buy a drink, ""trip"" and spill the drink and ice everywhere. About 10 minutes later he walks in to intentionally slip in the mess and land as hard as he can.

 He was tryng to sue the bowling alley and get a script for the pain but they somehow caught on and he was charged for that as well Lmfao.




You guys have any more stories that went posted in the other thread?

Hard to succeed but I'm giving it my all. I didn't come here to bitch about my situation but at least give you guys an update that I am still around but I got in trouble with the law recently.

So this dope that has been going around is all fent or something, I have seen posts people asking have you blacked out and done some insane shit? And yes, yes I have. This shit takes the withdrawals away but it is almost not even worth it. Sometimes I can do half a bag or 2 bags before I go bat shit insane.


Why can't we fucking get real dope, I have been using for the last 10 years but only Dope the last 3-4 but I have never experienced this insanity. What the FUCK are they putting in this shit. I guess I can say that I am thankful they are because now I don't even want to do it. I don't want to blackout and go insane to maybe feel better. If it was real dope that I could get sure I am all for it. 


Is this Flakka? What is going on? Am I losing my mind? I can get blues all day but they are so pricey that I need like $300s worth to even have fun and that shit goes in 4-5 hours. God damn it I wish this shit was legal so I could work and do it safely. I would be a perfectly functional person in society if I could go to the store and get it. 


Do dope dealers realize that if you are giving us this flakka shit or whatever fent bullshit that we are just going to stop doing? I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here!! Bring back real dope or I am just done with it. Done with it all!


Edit: Forgot to tell you how I got in trouble with the law. I was in a blackout episode apparently screaming like a lunatic in a bathroom and the cops were called on me.

9rjxdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9rjxdp/i_wanted_to_get_up_earlier/,7,https://redd.it/9rjxdp,sloan_fitch,I wanted to get up earlier...,"I got up at little before 6am and I wish I got up earlier, I wish it was possible but I didn't fall asleep until after midnight.

Along this phase of my recovery, while living the sub life I started experimenting with waking up early for practical reasons and to combat that bullshit sense of depression I think I have but isn't really that bad at all.

By getting up early I have all this extra time to think, to write, to read, to do whatever I want. On an off day this doesn't seem to matter... on work days it's nice because I have time to do shit before work. I work a lot of afternoons so if I get up in the morning I have like over five hours to myself. if I have work at 9am like today, it's another story. Before I started voluntarily waking up early, I would get up at 7am for a 9am shift. 7am - eat, shower.. wake up best as possible. Then shower and be ready to leave the house no later than 8:30am. This assumes no procrastination or jerking around/writing later than my ""cut-off"" time.

&nbsp;

I hate the cold of the winter, I hate waking up while it's still night out more than waking up early for work in general. Gettimg up early voluntarily on my days off helps to make it easier to wake up early on my normal work days. As I transition, as I potentially taper down my sub dose it'll be ever important I'm armed to cope with cold morning wake up routines. I've chosen that if I am to wake up early, I want to do it on my own terms.

&nbsp;

Although I sometimes have to work 3-10, or 5-11pm... when I have lots of days off in a row, or if I'm getting out of work before 9pm (preferably before 8pm) then I'm pretty much able to wake up early naturally. I started this experiment a little over two weeks ago because I had enough consecutive days off to acclimate and early work shifts scheduled to necessitate being able to wake up early.
Waking up early is kinda interesting. It's nice if you find yourself sitting aroudn at night wanting to sleep but unable to sleep... just wanting to end the day to start a new one already. Well, if you wake up real early such sleep comes naturally.

Logically to me, I wouldn't wake up at 6am if I went to bed at 2am but if I had to be at work every day at 9, I might consider getting my body in tune with sleeping at 10pm. 

&nbsp;

That's all I gotta say about sleep, I figure maybe this'll be of use or maybe not... but I haven't posted a grand post here recently and I wanted to drop in and say something to y'all.


Before I go, I ought to point out that I start my day with 2mg Suboxone and I haven't been re-dosing at all lately. Sometimes when I got up real early or had a long work day I would re-dose to ensure that I wouldn't get ""cold"" or ""the yawns"" towards the end of my shifts and unlikely as it has been proven to be in recent time.

This story has a happy ending after all,"I'm on a solo road trip through the south west, US. I brought some dope with me. When that ran out I cold copped in California with no problem. Got to try BTH for the first time.

I did the last of the Cali black last night so by the time I got to my stop tonight, dope sickness was creepin up fast. It's the final leg of my trip so I just needed a little something to stay good until I get home Saturday. I *thought* I could cold cop here pretty easily too. I've done it in much smaller cities.

I drove around all evening. Looking for an open air market spot or junkies roaming around that could hook me up. It was all off though. I couldnt find anything that looked promising, I felt fucking weird and sick, it just wasnt happening. I got to see the city which was nice but overall, disappointing. Finally at 10:30 pm I said fuck it and went back to my shithole hotel to try to sleep.

I'm wandering down the hall looking for my room when suddenly..dboy rolls up. He asks if I'm looking for something. I guess his dboy senses were tingling or something. I'm an undercover junkie. Anyway, I was fucking elated. I told him I've been looking for him all night. We get to talking and turns out...he only sells clear. He doesnt know anything about black. I'm crushed. It was just cruel. I had my fill of clear in Cali and it wasn't going to help me now. We shot the shit for a bit and then I sulked back to my room.


Of course, I couldnt sleep so a few hours later I go down for a smoke and his homie is outside and asks for a square. I finally find the chance to ask him if he knows where the black is in this God forsaken town. He says, ""Yeah I got you. Let's take a ride."" I didnt get my hopes up yet though. Not again. Apparently, his buddy traps 5 minutes from here. I was kind of expecting some sort of odyssey to make it happen considering how tonight had been going but 20 minutes later I've got my dope and I gave my middle a 20 for his trouble. I love efficiency. 

After all that searching and then a huge let down, it really was right under my nose the whole time! Shot half of it already and feeling fine :) Junkie jesus has been looking out for me through this trip. But tonight was a rollercoaster. Happy nods guys. Stay safe!

I recently travelled to Cambodia and loaded up on a few boxes of Dicodin LP (60mg Dihydrocodeine).

From Google I determined that these are extended release and not Instant. I am an absolute newbie and have only tried Codeine before (100mg makes me nod with weed).

I tried 60mg last night but felt almost nothing which I assumed is because it's extended release. Research tells me DHC is about 1.5-2.0x as strong as codeine so i was hoping it would work.

I honestly have no knowledge about these, can anyone offer any advice on what is a good dose or am I fucked since they're extended release?

Yesterday was ""tomorrow"" and we didnt hear anything from him all day except a text saying that hell let us know when we can head down, didnt hear from him again all night until 1AM we get a text saying ""sorry man my phone ran out of texts, I didnt get with my guy today I'm meeting with him tomorrow"" which would be today, we still have yet to hear anything.

9rd89n,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9rd89n/methadonefentanyl_overdose/,16,https://redd.it/9rd89n,cactusandroses,Methadone/Fentanyl overdose,"I have zero personal experience with unprescribed drug use, but a young relative recently died from an overdose. The autopsy results say there was methadone and Fentanyl present, but found nothing else. According to the coroner, there was no sign that my relative was a previous heroin user, but friends have given the parents very mixed stories, some saying that heroin was tried once, others say the relative would never, ever have used heroin. But from my research on methadone, it seems like nobody ever just takes methadone for the fun of it, but only to help with withdrawals.

The relative knew and had talked with parents about the dangers of Fentanyl, so it seems strange that they would have *knowingly* taken Fentanyl. But yet why would anyone just take Methadone?

The parents are just so devastated and have no answers and it doesn't appear that any will be coming. I'm hoping that someone(s) here can offer some insight into what MAY have happened, what sounds plausible, or why an informed and knowledgeable person, and from physical appearances and coroner results seems to have been a drug novice, might have somehow taken methadone and Fentanyl mixed.

The seller was a personal friend of the relative, but told police there was no involvement in this case, which is disputed by the significant other. There's nothing clear and there's no real 'evidence'.  There was a roommate present who wasn't told when the relative used the night of the overdose, and the significant other was out-of-town, also another relative lived in the same building, and there was insignificant texting between the two seemingly near the time of the overdose, so the overdose seems to have occurred within planned solitude. This relative appeared to be quite happy; their career of choice was taking off suddenly, and their significant other was about to move in. To everyone outside, their life seemed to be at a peak  (they were early 20s.). Nobody thinks that the overdose was intentional, but of course nobody else can ever know what anybody truly has going on in their internal world.

Nothing makes sense about it, and I don't know if it ever will, but if anyone has any ideas about possible explanations or even just a similar story, I'd be grateful for anything anyone has to share. I wish you all the very best!",1540494196.0

Injecting salt is **very painful** and can be **dangerous**\-- at worst, it can cause cardiac arrest (especially in large doses). It can also cause bad muscle pain, bloody urine, etc.

PLEASE **taste test** first-- if it tastes salty, don't use it! If still uncertain, take a small test shot before proceeding.

The person selling this is not a dealer; however, he is telling folks that the bags are from a dealer in order to appear legitimate. I know at least 5 of our participants have already fallen for it, and while luckily they're okay, injecting salt is serious business so please be on alert if you're in the area.

From where I am at the moment, just getting stable on substitution meds rather than using both methadone and heroin would be step in the right direction.

The reason I ask this question is because I have suffered from depression my whole adult life. I have also, at one time or another over the same period, experienced the whole trifecta of addictions: drugs/alcohol, sex and gambling. I've smoked, popped, sniffed or shot pretty much everything except hallucinogens; I've had compulsive sex with girls after exchanging glances on the night bus home or wandered dreamlike through dimly lit orgies already knowing that whatever is about to happen will be remembered the next day in an absolute swamp of guilt and self-loathing, and while doing research for a magazine article managed to get myself temporarily hooked on slot machines in front of which I'd sit hour after dreary hour until it felt as if my eyeballs were melting and my ears would never stop hearing the dismal ""ding-ding-ding"" of the electronic wheels going round and round.

All of these addictions were a kind of self-medicating, of course. I come from a long line of addicts as well as depressives. My childhood is marked by traumas - physical as well as emotional - and when I've been clean, or even just cleaner, it's been like the whole pot of memories and heartaches has been stirred up so violently it sent things I thought I'd forgotten right back to the surface - hauntings that twist me up and leave me writhing around in a kind of psychoemotional horrorshow.

Recently, though, I signed up with a doctor and started methadone maintenance. I've been using on the side sometimes, but not always. When I don't however, I feel so completely crushed by depression that I seriously begin to question whether I will ever manage to be even remotely clean. I can barely get out of bed - my life is reduced to getting up, going to the doctor, then dragging my arse back home and killing time until I have to do it all over again. It's no kind of existence - I am suicidal, I am full of unshed tears, I am a complete fucking mess.

This isn't who I am - not all of me, and it certainly isn't where I want my life to come to a halt. So what can I do? I was prescribed two types of anti-depressants a few years ago, but neither worked. Does anyone here have experience of this, or anything else that might help me?

I was driving around my town today and just felt exactly how i used to feel. 

We live in a clown world. So many people feel empty, we have no sense of belonging to anything, there is no real future for anyone that means anything. Nothing means anything anymore. 

I dont want to work or participate in this society, because it is a broken one. Im tired of feeling insecure, inadequate and alone. If the NPC masses stand in my way of true freedom and goal of happiness i see no point in going on. I dont even want to go back to using anymore, i would rather just end this life (this is not a suicide post). Im just not interested in what being a NPC normie in society has to offer me. I dont want a girlfriend, i dont want a car, i dont want a house, i dont want a job. You know why? Because of the conditions that come with it.

I have thought about becoming a soldier but the military wants to give me vaccines (which i would refuse), and feed me trash multinational corporate food (i only eat a very specific natural diet). 

Now that im clean i can see what my use was for what it was. Just a way to ignore this oppressive feel and neuroticism instilled in myself by myself as a result of this indoctrinated views on sex, careers, money, relationships. 

Does anyone else get me when i say nothing means nothing? I think you could put a loaded rig in front of me now and i could just flush it down the toilet after thinking about it for a second. Im not even mad or sad. It feels like i could die right now and i couldnt be bothered to care.

So what im saying is that i would go back to using if i knew i was going to continue my old life. But im not going to. I feel like old me is about near dead. In a way, im thankful.",1540436292.0

I've seen a good bit of the opiate/opioid/heroin posts here on this forum (and a lot of them actually do look quite interesting/informative) and I do indeed intend to read through most if not all of them quite in depth. That said, I have a specific question that I've had for a while now, and I've even gotten it answered before but to varying degrees and and with some saying yes and some saying no (black/white, you know, everyone seems to be either up or down on this issue but none can ever agree uniformly).   
Now, I've been on buprenorphine now for quite some time and I used heroin for years heavily before that. mostly #4 powdered heroin (brown/tan and/or grey) as I'm from the northeast US. Now, I've always been told that buprenorphine makes using opiates impossible (it blocks them) but I've also been told that this isn't enitrely true, especially if you use a lot of and/or a strong opiate (like good heroin) and/or if your ROA is intense (like IV injection). Just to get it out there, for the most part I do like staying clean, but every once in a while I do ""treat"" myself and I get some dope and use it. whenever I do that I always IV inject it and I always feel it. It is always to varying degrees but I always feel it at least a little bit. this is with buprenorphine in my system (subutex so lots of buprenorphine due to frequent and high daily dosings but no naloxone) and I always feel it, just to differing degrees. Now, I am on the sublocade once a month 300 mg shot (I'm due for my third or fourth shot soon) and I seem to have the same issues with using H occassionally as I did when doing so while on high daily doses of subutex (oral buprenorphine with no naloxone, since sublocade is steady release BUPE injection but with no naloxone). Again, just for the record, if I use suboxone films (that have naloxone in them) I don't/can't feel shit for like a day or two, no matter how much I do or what/how I do it. So, the naloxone does work and work well as a full blocker but I always was told that just the BUPE itself was a blocker of opiates and the naloxone was just added protection as well as to ensure you didn't abuse the BUPE itself. IDFK!!. (hence, why I'm asking here, hopefully someone can finally clarify this shit to me).  


I know this may be kind of a stupid/annoying question for some of you and it may have been debated ad nauseum already in certain places. However, if you wouldn't mind (and you posses the proper knowledge and/or experience to do so), just to set my head straight and let me know once and for all what's really going on and what is and isn't just in my head or not (since I swear I DO INDEED get high whenever I use H, even while on lots of BUPE, be it oral subutex or this new sublocade injection, as long as there is no naloxone present at all).   
Is this the REAL truth of the matter (this is what I've come up with)? That Buprenorphine (with no naloxone) even at frequent and/or high doses (administered orally or XR injection, doesn't really matter) MAY block and/or at least reduce the effects of some opiates and/or when opiates are administered certain ways. But if you use certain other opiates/opiates that are strong enough to break through then you will still get high and feel their effects? Also, if you administer said opiates using an ROA that is intense enough to break through the BUPE (such as IV injecting)? And, especially so when combining both of these techniques/situations (such as IV injecting GOOD/STRONG Heroin)?  


Sorry for the long, boring and possibly confusing question, especially on something that like I said may have already been debated to death here, I just really wanna know what is going on here once and for all (I'm just that kind of a person, idk). Because, like I said, I swear I get high, to differing degrees, whenever I shoot H, even when on lots of BUPE (oral/subutex and this new sublocade shot) and I wanna know exactly why, if that's possible to know.   


Also, As a P.S., I'm sure the ""differing degrees"" I speak about are from differing amounts of H and in differences in the strength of the H I'm using (and also possibly differences in the amount of BUPE active in my system at the time, even with no naloxone) but I have also noticed differences in how high I feel when shooting H while on any type of BUPE preparation (no naloxone) depending on the type of H I use. Whenever I use Black Tar Heroin (which I have a few good connects for even though I'm in the northeast US) it always feels like it breaks through harder and gets me higher for longer than the powder dope I get (and I get GOOD powder). Is there a reason behind BTH breaking through BUPE better (and staying broken through)? Or is it just in my head? Or could it be something like since I mostly usually use powdered dope regularly anyway that when I use BTH while on BUPE since I'm using a new type of dope and using enough to make sure I break through the BUPE at that that I could just be feeling it more because of those reasons at the moment? (This one is extra weird to me since I've always read/been told that Black Tar Heroin, or BTH, is on average, generally weaker/less potent than #4 powdered dope). So, WTF is the real deal here??!!  


Again, one last time, I know this might be stupid to some people to the point of being annoying/irritating,and for those of you I DO APOLOGIZE. But I feel it could potentially be enlightening/educative and informative, especially to those on BUPE preparation medications/treatments (be it oral/sub-lingual or sublocade monthly XR shot, etc.) Because for people who do use H (and other opiates) while on BUPE I'm sure there is info. they should know to be/stay totally safe and to do it the right and safe way if they're gonna do it at all. also, when I KNOW I feel something and then I have people (even doctors, counselors, etc.) telling me that there is no way, that it's impossible, that I'm on a blocker and that there is just no possible way, then I just gotta know what's going on. Especially when different ROA's and also even different types of the same opiate (different types of Heroin) make me feel differing degrees of ""high"" effects than that makes it seem much less imagined, fake, and in my head and much more subjective and real. And, just like mixing H and other opiates with methadone (for those on methadone treatment) turned out to be, I'm sure there is a right and wrong way to mix opiates with BUPE (if and/or when you choose to do so) and that the wrong way could potentially lead to much easier times overdosing, so I think this is an important and viable topic, even if irritating for some (or many), again SORRY.

So I have a drug test coming up in 12 days. I know that oxycodone typically leaves urine within 3-4 days. However, I consumed 500ml of red grapefruit juice prior to dosing in order to potentiate the effects. Doing so increases total plasma concentration and half life.

I then did this a 3rd time (30 mg again) about 3 hours after the second dose. Essentially I consumed the same amount of juice and tums before each dose to maximize absorption/inhibition of receptors. 

&#x200B;

I consumed a total of 110mg extended release oxycodone over the course of the evening. 

&#x200B;

My question is, does anyone have a guess on how long the inhibitions of my receptors from the potentiation would add to the duration it will take to be clean? I was clean for 2 weeks before taking the oxycodone, so it was essentially a small binge over the course of a few hours. 

&#x200B;

I know, I‚Äôm dumb as hell, but google doesn't have any answers, nor does the search bar.

Here are some terrifying excerpts I've plucked:

Pharmcists can decline to fill based soley on ""suspicion"" that the medicine is for illigitimate use: "" (1) circumstances under which a pharmacist may, consistent with section 309 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 829) and regulations thereunder, including section 1306.04 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, decline to fill a prescription for a controlled substance because the pharmacist suspects the prescription is fraudulent, forged, or of doubtful, questionable, or suspicious origin; and ""

...not like thats anything new, but it just gives them more encouragement to do so since there is a law that they can deny treatment now based on random thoughts in their head.

Now for the really scary shit:

‚Äú(2) The Attorney General may, if the Attorney General determines it will assist in avoiding the overproduction, shortages, or diversion of a controlled substance, establish an aggregate or individual production quota under this subsection, or a procurement quota established by the Attorney General by regulation, in terms of pharmaceutical dosage forms prepared from or containing the controlled substance.‚Äù;

‚Äú(i) (1) (A) In establishing any quota under this section, or any procurement quota established by the Attorney General by regulation, for fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, or hydromorphone (in this subsection referred to as a ‚Äòcovered controlled substance‚Äô), the Attorney General shall estimate the amount of diversion of the covered controlled substance that occurs in the United States.

Basically this translates to: Jeff sessions can use the false CDC or other data to set any limits on manufacturing that he feels like

I wonder what Jeff sessions will do now that he has free reign to do whatever he wants. We all know exactly what he will do.

Once you've switched to heroin though, don't worry! the bill provides lots of things to make your life easier and make it so you don't get dopesick ever again like chronic pain patients do each month when they can't get their script filled.

That means strong effects at low doses, and withdrawal from things which shouldn't cause withdrawal according to most doctors. Kratom is a serious substance, but for my chronic pain the costs far outweigh the negatives. Even as I write this in withdrawals, I don't regret a thing. I regretted getting dependant on morphine when I was withdrawing, and for months before when the side effects were killing me (literally).* 
        
# To the FDA/DEA, you'll pry my kratom from my cold, dead hands.        
     
Making this post because normally I'd buy more leaf or tough the withdrawals out with weed and benadryl in mass quantities. I cannot afford a thing. So I've got
       
1 single 300mg Gabapentin.    
   
19 grams of quality leaf.      
       
13.5g of awful leaf.      
       
Hopefully I can space it out and I can be ""normal"" in class tomorrow and Friday, and but my usage is 6g (7g of awful leaf) every 4 hours when awake. 6x5 if I take the most doses in a day (which is rare) is 30g daily. This is down from 60g a few months back.         
 
I don't know what do. I can't go back on the pills, but I have insurance. Even if I got them, which two doctors told me they would back me up in getting, I didn't get relief and the side effects were hell. And then I'd have to get off then eventually, which was hell last time. I swore up and down I'd never swallow a prescription opioid ever again, yet I choke down kratom like it's my job.          
          
So kratom daily for two years now. Not just because it's better than opioids, but because when I take kratom i have a significant better quality of life. I've gone off for almost 9 months and it was just not worth it. Granted I had been on and off opioid like plants and opioids for about 1 and a half year solid, but I don't think that I didn't wait long enough. I know ""getting clean"" takes longer, especially the lasting psychological symptoms, but my pain is here to stay and I'm so fucking tired of hurting for no reason.          
          
I have been told by my friend he could easily set me up with product if I wanted to start selling weed/psychs, even saying he'd front it, but I've never sold drugs before and I don't feel like starting now.       
         
So yeah, hi /r/drugs. I'm sweaty, irritable, shaky, nauseous, and aching like a motherfucker. I'm not suicidal, which I find surprising.        
      
It really helps that I've got an amazing girl lately. It's not like it's not awful, but she makes me forget about how awful it is so easily just by being around me.       
     
She stayed with me last night through the first night when I skipped the first dose and instead took my last 75mg of benadryl and an old Seroquel to knock me out, was there when I woke up super early shaking and sweating and wanting to throw up, watched me take a small dose in the morning an hour and a half before my class and still leave feeling like death, come back to her still laying in my bed like an angel as I sniffled and sneezed when I came back after class to lay in bed with her all morning.      
        
She's coming back in a half hour to spend another night with me. I've never had someone be here for me through this, and I've done this many times. I don't feel as depressed or alone as when I usually withdraw.

Then i got mad at her and left the house in only boxers and a little throw blanket. I have no idea what i did while i was out but I didn't make it home till 5am apparently. When i woke up i didn't remember any of what i had done. But when i went to get a drink in the kitchen her mom started talking shit about the night before. I told her that i couldn't remember anything she was talking about and she said 'i bet you dont!'  i appoligised and she told me that it was ok, that she understood why i did it but if i do it again that she was going to tase me lol. I woke up on day 8 after being blacked out for a solid 24 hours feeling GREAT i managed to gain 7 pounds while i was blacked out. I lost about 10 pounds from detoxing and gained almost all of it back in one benzo fuled night. And since that day ive been withdraw free!! Ive slipped up a few times im not gonna lie. I forgot how good herion actually feels. Ive been using for so long to just feel normal that I forgot what the drug actually feels like. I was amazed by how little i could do and still get so high. So the worst relapse ive had is using 3 days in a row and I still didn't get sick. But im scared that  im gonna fuck around and get myself sick again. Which is something i never want to feel again. So if there is anyone that still manages to use without getting physical dependency i would really appreciate your input on how much/how long i can get away with using without any bad side effects. 
On the real though, im so proud of myself a few weeks ago i would have told you that ill never quit, that i didn't WANT to quit that i was SCARED to quit. Now i realize that those are a weak mans words. I can't believe i let something so stupid tottaly ruin everything i had going for me. Before we quit we were useing minimum of 3 grams a day. And i quit cold turkey. Hardest thing ive ever done but i fucking did it man. If i can do it anyone can. I know that probably means nothing to the person reading this right now cause i use to read storys like this all the time and it never changed my mind about getting high. I couldn't find any reason to stop doing something that made me feel so good, that made everything ok no matter what, as long as i had a sack everything was ok even if my life was falling apart i wouldn't care cause all i needed was that next shot. I numbed everything out for so long that i dont know how to manage all the emotions i feel now. I have ruined lifelong relationships with family members and not felt bad about it one bit bacause i was high. Im not that kinda person, im loveing and loyal and will do anything for the people i love. But when i was high i couldn't care less about anyone but myself...thats the worst part to me about my addiction, i cant believe the things ive said and done to the ones i love just because i was so high that i pushed anyone away that wanted to.help or.took advantage of there kindness.. i only hope that i can find a way to get there forgivness and earn back there trust. I know this is anonymous and im a total stranger to you. But just incase this is someone i have wronged. Im sorry im so sorry that i couldn't admit to you that i was going through addiction. I still haven't told any of you about it.. im ashamed and feel like you will think im using it as an excuse and i dont want to disappoint you anymore. I love you mom and im so so sorry for taking advantage of your kindness. I wish i had the guts to tell her that myself. But im so ashamed of my actions that i cant even force the words out to her. Sorry for this long post guys i just needed to get some stuff out of my head and tell my lil story to someone. 
ALSO!! if anyone is trying to get clean and needs someone to support them through the process please contact me. What helped me most was when my friends would tell me that I could do it and that i was stronger than this addiction . And most of all the reminders that if i got high that i would just be restarting the withdraw process. Dont hesitate to contact me if you need someone to support you. No one should have to go through that alone. Something as simple as tellimg them you believe in them can make the difference. Atleast it did for me. I honestly would have gave in on day 3 if it wasn't for having that one friend who actually cares for you and will be there for you when your at your lowest. I will be that person for you if you dont have anybody. I literally only have one friend that supported me the whole way, and i will forever have his back and be there for him no matter what. I couldn't believe how many of my 'friends"" just stopped talking to me at all because i wanted to get clean. Its crazy how people can just cut others off like that. People ive been friends with for fucking years. It hurts my feelings even thinking about it as i write this. I really thought they cared for me. But they only cared when it benefited THEM. But when i need someone to help me through a tuff time, only one was there for me. Sorry i got off track, that just blows my mind how people can just erase you from there life. 
Thanks for reading!! Some of it might not make since but I needed to get it out of my head.

Let me explain, So i moved from my home town about 2 years ago went from a small town (population under 1500) to the biggest city near me, had no peoblem finding work i started installing floors for a 5 star company. Now i had already had a herion problem before i moved, but ill soon realize that what i thought of as 'dope sick'  wasn't shit. Within only a couple months the company i was working for recognized my ability to learn fast and my natural ability to be a leader. Within a couple months i was making twice what the other guy that started right befofe me was making and i had been promoted to his boss and was making roughly 750 a week. At the time i was only 19 and making more money than i ever had before and was running my own crew, only down side was the crazy amount of pressure my boss put on me to get the job done. Not just done right but fast, being the lead any mistakes would be considered my fault and my boss would send me and one helper the same age as me to multi million dollar homes to install there floors. The look on the home owners faces was priceless whenever i would walk in with my hair down to my shoulders and usually reaking of weed. But every time i would amaze the people with my speed and skill. My floors were beautiful,  they would show there gratitude with considerable tips, im talking i never got less than 80$ for a tip. during this time i was unable to get any h because i didn't know anyone to buy from down there. About 2 months into my new job i decided to try my luck with craigs list. Almost instantly my phone started blowing up, mostly people that were looking to score also or the messages from people saying they had what i wanted seemed to sketchy, one day i got a text from a guy saying he could help me out and wasn't that far from me. He aggreed to exchange facebooks and stuff like that to calm my worries of being set up by an undercover. After talking to him a couple days i felt comfortable enough to make a deal. I ask what he wanted to introduce me to his dealer. All he wanted was a half. Which where  im from would cost no less than 50$. I ask him about prices and this dude tells me 50$ a GRAM! I assumed that it couldn't be tar so i ask if it was cheese and he told me no, that it was tar. I couldn't believe what i was hearing, i went and met up with him after work we went to the plugs house and he took me inside and everything went great. When we left i ask the guy i met off Craigslist if he minded if i came inside to do a shot. He said that was fine but he didn't shoot, this was the first person i met that was a dailey user and snorted his shit. Not only did he snort it but he could mix a half gram with sleepanal on a plate with just a razor blade and a lil water quicker than i could pull up a shot. I had forgotten how amazing herion was, that first shot after months had me FADED it was so much stronger than anything i had gotten from my home town. It took no time until i was spending an easy 500 a week on tar. Because i could afford it i wasn't thinking about what i was doing to me and my wife. Not to mention the loss of drive to Excel at work. So i got in a pattern of working and being high the entire time i wasn't at work. Then one day i forgot to go re-up on tar and only had enough to do a shot when i first woke up, that just happen to also be the day that my boss made me work a 12 hour shift. By the time i made it home i could barely walk my legs were hurting so bad and i had extreme cold sweats and couldn't control my body temperature and was in the worst full body pain i had ever felt. I had no idea why i felt so aweful, before when i got sick in my home town i was just moody and mean and would get extreme diarrhea. But could still go to work and do my dailey chores around my house. Not this time, it hurt so bad that i couldn't even drive to the plugs house to pick up. So made my wife drive cause she wasn't as sick as i was yet, i guess because i was sweating all day and working while she was at the nice cool house all day. That was the longest 30 min drive of my life, by the time i got the tar i was convinced that nothing could help my pain. Let me tell you something, the feeling that i got when i did the first shot while i was sick, i could not believe the INSTANT relief i felt. The relief of feeling better was almost better than the high its self. This pattern of extreme drug abuse continued for almost two years. I was never sick again after that day. Then one day i showed uo for work and my boss told me that we had to leave right then to go work outta town for a week. I went into instant panic telling him that i needed to run home first and trying to make up amy excuse i could tp try to get him to let me go buy enough to last the whole time i was outta town. But he wouldn't let me go. He made me drive 6 hours away that morning to start the job. I had to beg my wife to bring me enough to stay well. Only one problem, she had just paid our billa for the month and only had enough cash left for a gram and enough gas to get to where i was. I told her fuck it, come on. She made it there by the time i got off that night. I would just sneak her into my hotel room at night and let her stay there while we we're at work ( if my boss knew she was there he would have fired me) we managed to stretch that gram 3 days and i had been working 16 hour days to try and smash the job so that i wouldn't  get sick. But that plan didn't work. And i could have finished the job the next day if i tryed hard enough, but when i woke up i couldn't even get out of bed i was so sick. My boss came to my hotel room and when i told him i was to sick to work he freaked out and told me if i didn't start feeling better that it would be my last day working for that company. 
I had only taken 1 sick day in almost two years and was late mabye 3 times. So it pissed me off really bad when he said that. So i told him i guezs im fired then cause im not doing shit today. Then he gave me a terrible look of anger and slamed my door. 
I figured if im fired anyway that i have no reason to lay there in pain. So i went and told my wife tbat we were headed home. Ive never drove so fast for so long until that day. I drove 120 for 4 hours until i made it to fimilar roads. By the time i had made it back my bosses wife was blowing up my phone. I finally awmserd and she say ""where did you go?"" I told her what had happened and told her i was coming to get my check. She sounded confused but said ok. Then came the problem of wanting to get well before i face the ladys at the office, then i remembered that we had some brand new parts for the car that i had bought the weel before but didn't have time to install. BINGO i went straight to the store i had bought them from and walked out with 89 dollars. Waited on the plug for like a fucking hour and finally got well. When i arrived at the shop the ladys started asking me why i left and how i got back. So i told them what happened and the bosses wife called me a liar and said that he never said i was fired and just told me to lay down till i felt better, which was NOT the truth, my helper was in the room when he said it. I had text talking to him about it. But they would not believe me and just kept calling me a liar. Then she says that because of my actions that they wanted me to take a hair follicle test before i could come back to work. It was 3 different test that covered every drug or sinthetic drug. I immidently told her that she could go get fucked And that i quit. She pleded with me that they would pay for the test and even pick me up to take me. I was having nun of it tho. Other people i work with have done way worst stuff and never got tested, like not showing up for work and not even calling or going to a job and getting nothing done. So i got my last check and went on my merry way. I had found another job within a week making 120 a day installing floor for a guy i worked with at my last jobs brother. He spoke no english and got upset that i couldn't understand him. But he liked my work. Only problem was that he didn't always have work for us because we would do jobs so fast that he was making enough money to not have to work everyday. This resulted in me being sick within the first week. I knew i couldn't afford my habit and pay my bills with the way work was going. But i said fuck it im not gonna be sick. Which made me get behind on bills fast. Within a month my landlord had had enough and kicked us out. We had no where to go but back to my wifes parents house back in our home town. I had brought some tar back home with us. But i didn't last long as planned and then it happened, my wifes parents found our box of rigs and spoons and stuff and freaked the fuck out. But they told me that if i was willing to get clean that they would support me through the whole process( she didn't know what kinda pain i was really about to go through) i was amazed that they were really willing to help me. So i got the box and all my rigs and stuff and broke it all right there infront of her mom. I told her mom that it was gonna get real bad real fast . She said ""it probably wont be as bad as you think"" . Let me tell you, it was worst than i even imagined it would be. The first 5 days i couldn't sleep or eat because my legs would shake to bad to walk even to the kitchen and anything my wife tryed to feed me i threw right back up. My wife decided that she wanted to get on methadone matinance. I refused to trade one addiction for another. So after 6 days of no sleep or eating just laying in bed curled up in a ball sweating and having explosive diarrhea (thank god our room has a bathroom)  my friend came over with some Xanax he had just gotten through the darkweb. He said that they were 5mg of alp in each pill. I didn't really care i just ate one. Shortly after he admits to me that the guy he orders from puts multiple different benzos and rc benzos in his bars. By the time he told me that i guess it was starting to kick in cause i dont remember shit after that. I woke up to a house full of people mad at me and i didn't know why. Apparently i took everything out of the fridge and ate whatever i could get in my mouth. And almost burned down the house by turning the toaster on its side and trying to stuff bread with shredded cheese on it inside the toaster. My wife's mom said she tryed to stop ",1540382690.0

I have been noticing this recently and wonder if it happens to anyone else. When I wake up, I usually take between 50-70mg IR Oxycodone.

9qy4oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9qy4oq/sleep_on_suboxone/,24,https://redd.it/9qy4oq,msboobybuyer,Sleep on Suboxone,"Holy fuck I've been on it for 3 weeks and even with (for times the 15 mg dose I was given) temazepam (Restoril), I'm sleeping 4 hours a night in average. I bought some klonopin from a friend and the last two nights I've slept SIX HOURS, which I'm *so* happy about, but I need more sleep than that.

I should maybe also mention on that first night of klonopin, I took two ephedrine pills and two ginseng capsules so I would stop passing out at 5pm and at least be able to stay up until 9:30 so I could get *actual* sleep. It worked great. I mean, probably not the best idea because it increased my heart rate to 140 bpm).

[This](http://imgur.com/gallery/c4oCqZa) is my sleep schedule last week on Suboxone. The one where I got 11 hours of sleep was after 5 temazepam capsules.

I can't tell if this is the suboxone or just because I'm in so much pain from not having my pain meds.

I'm curious if anyone else had this experience with it. I'm on the 8/2 but started cutting it in half and spitting out the naloxone (as instructed by the shrink who is prescribing it because he said that has to be ingested to have effect and I'm not actually on it for addiction) hoping it would help both the insane constipation (no kidding, 14 days) *and* my sleep.

Fucking seriously. I legit *cried* yesterday morning with happiness because I slept through an entire night (check that link to see why That's a big deal for me).

Ps thanks to all of you pointing out I apparently know nothing about naloxone lol

Okay, here's a HUGE update:

I was in so much pain at work so I had to leave after two hours. I haven't cried in about five years, and was massively ugly crying after work because of the pain.

I happen to go past the prescriber's office on my way home from work so I went in hoping they would help me. They offered to ""work me in"" but I told them there was absolutely no way I could sit for that long. *They got me back immediately*. On my entire life, I have not had that happen but the fact that it took me so long to get to their window and was crying have them the hint I was telling the truth.

He had called in a medication that doesn't help me with sleep (trazodone) and had claimed he sent in a script for double the dose of my temazepam. He didn't.

But more importantly, the man who told me last time that I should be taking half the dose he gave me decided to change it to DOUBLE the dose.

So I went home and took two plus a 15mh temazepam, 2mg klonopin, and a zanaflex (muscle relaxer that makes me tired). I slept all day. And now, instead of walking like a cowboy who just got off their horse, I'm able to get off the couch without a problem and waking like a normal person.

I'm really hoping I get the same effect (minus the sleepy) tomorrow. Crossed your fingers for me.

I'm aware that a lot of this seems like it belongs in r/chronicpain but those people are 90% judgemental counts so I posted it here because you guys are great and actually know about Suboxone.

I love you all and thanks for the replies!",1540373874.0

I am currently homeless, I am also currently addicted to heroin. 

However, I also keep the area I camp at clean (as best as possible anyway...I have to make trips to dumpsters with my trash but I never let it build up to extreme levels) and I don't commit crime (aside from purchasing heroin and camping in city limits... both crimes that hurt no one but myself).

People commenting on that Facebook post were advocating for all homeless people to be rounded up and thrown into a barbed wire enclosure until they can ""conform"" to society, they were saying all homeless people don't want help and just want to rob and steal, people were commenting that addicts dont have a disease - they're just making an active descion to use drugs, among other nasty things.

From an outside perspective I can totally see how someone might look at an addict and think they're making the choice to use drugs and ruin their lives consciously and can stop anytime they want. Until I became addicted to heroin, I thought the same thing. Let me tell you though, addiction is a powerful thing as I'm sure most on this sub realize. It's an altering of your brain, your reward system gets completely hijacked and you're never going to be the same as before you became addicted.

I feel like a lot of people look at the homeless and those with addiction issues as second class citizens. They lump them all together. I know there are bad people out there who also happen to be homeless or an addict but there are also good people who do want help and don't commit crimes against other people and don't deserve to be treated like dirt. The constant stares, the comments about how maybe you look dirty or smell bad. It hurts to experience these things and if people want more addicts to recover and more homeless people to get homes and jobs and live lives beneficial to the rest of society, they need to start opening their hearts and treating these people like they would like to be treated.

I'm tired of people calling the cops when they see someone sleeping somewhere in public. How are they hurting you? Just stop it. Mind your own business and let the cops take care of violent criminals instead of having to shuffle people along to appease you for some dumbass reason.

9qxjih,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9qxjih/i_think_my_doctor_skipped_med_school_is_reckless/,19,https://redd.it/9qxjih,iAmAPickleYo,"I think my doctor skipped med school, is reckless, or tried killing me? I Feel Fucked And Raped. What do I do? [TL;DR in there]","So I went to my new primary care physician (3rd visit) & really cried out for help because my psychiatrist of 7 years won‚Äôt increase my Valium dosage (2mg x3 daily....). Told my psychiatrist that the 10mg Valium my dentist gave me for extreme dental phobia (single tablet written each visit) worked better than the Ativan he had me on for all these years, & it doesn‚Äôt impair me, & he freaked out saying ‚Äúoh no that‚Äôs way too much, it‚Äôs all the same!! 2mg Valium twice a day is plenty!‚Äù Then next visit: ‚ÄúYou are lucky to have me increase it to 2mg three times a day for you!‚Äù

Considering that, I explained to my physician how my psychiatrist is handling this issue I‚Äôm having & my physician tells me: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt write you a benzo you‚Äôre going to have to discuss this with your psychiatrist‚Äù right after I just explained all of what my psychiatrist is doing...

*My this physician sees & is aware that I‚Äôm prescribed ZOLOFT-100MGx1, ADDERALL-20MGx2, VALIUM-2MGx3, SUBOXONE-1MGx2 on his chart as far as my psyche meds go & asks me ‚Äúhave you tried BUSPAR?‚Äù, ‚Äúyes it gave me facial twitches & I also tried just about every SSRI,SNRI,TCAs,etc., over the 7 years with my psychiatrist to find which meds helped me the most, but he‚Äôs not adjusting the Valium to the dose I respond well to‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm going to give you some Lexapro, itlll work great for you! Start by breaking the pill into little pieces and take more and more each day! You‚Äôll feel better‚Äù. I tell him, but I‚Äôve been on it at 14 & felt extremely suicidal a few days in on it & which went away when I stopped, and also from my knowledge wouldn‚Äôt the Lexapro interact with the Zoloft because they‚Äôre both SSRI antidepressants??‚Äù 
He tells me ‚Äúno Lexapro isn‚Äôt an antidepressant or any of that, it‚Äôs used for the exact symptoms of panic & anxiety you‚Äôre having. It‚Äôs an anxiety pill you‚Äôll be ok, come back and 3 months you‚Äôll feel better when I see you next, and make sure you get your blood work & follow up with the orthopedic surgeon for you neck pain issue‚Äù*

Unless I‚Äôm crazy and there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing, shouldn‚Äôt this doctor know what kind of medicine he‚Äôs writing in the first place? Second, he‚Äôs not aware that Zoloft and Lexapro are in the same class & there‚Äôs too many serious risks of mixing two SSRI‚Äôs on top of being on Adderall & Suboxone which impact serotonin as well... thirdly, as I sit there waiting in his office, I hear just about half of the waiting room talking about how long they‚Äôve been waiting how they need to get their Percocet cause they have people waiting to buy it, another guy talking about trading his bars for Percocet everybody all loud and loose without a care in the world saying all of this shit loudly in front of the receptionist, I‚Äôm sitting there quietly panicking looking like I have a disability, and the doctor keeps his office door open & I could hear the patients from in there so this ‚Äúphysician‚Äù really sounds like he‚Äôs not taking his career in medicine seriously... xannie bars & percs to dealers; 
patient with panic disorder w/ Agoraphobia, general/social anxiety disorder, ADHD, OCD, PTSD, blood pressure reading of around 160/95 & 130 bears per minute sitting: cannot help me with an increase of Valium which is still a very small dose even if written at 10mg x3 daily... not even another benzo in mind... add on lexapro to Zoloft Adderall and Suboxone...

Sorry for sounding so Bitchy but everytime I reach out for help and explain what‚Äôs helped & what hasn‚Äôt, I feel so mistreated & disregarded yet I respect the doctor, I don‚Äôt respond until he‚Äôs done talking, I even walk out with a respectful goodbye, a compliment for him & thank him even though I felt like arguing back & getting loud with a doctor for the first time in my entire life.. 

What the hell does it truly take to get a benzo prescription when you need it & or rather the med works fine but the dosage doesn‚Äôt? I‚Äôm not even trying to get Xanax because Xanax doesn‚Äôt work for me. What the hell am I doing wrong? Am I not overacting enough; do I have to do the ‚Äúoverly-stressed-out-housewife-and-full-time-mommy-of-14-children-and-threatening-to-murder-my-husband-unless-I-take-something-stronger-than-pill-that-can-knock-out-an-elephant-because-my-nerves-are-so-shot-out-24/7-I-can‚Äôt-live-my-life-maybe-I-need-a-small-dose-of-Xanax-2MG-about-7-times-a-day-doctor!‚Äùapproach?

PS: when my grandma was alive she gave me her Valium 10mg x90 every month (free, she no longer needed it & saw me suffering playing lab rat with psychiatrist trying too many meds) at 14 years old; gave me instructions on how to take it, and never once have I abused it until I lost my dad, my mom, and my grandma (84) when I was 18 and was offered my first Oxycodone. Now I‚Äôm 20, I‚Äôll be 6 months clean & stable except I don‚Äôt have mom, dad, Grammy & her loving care + her dosage Valium that lasted me just over 30 days. Thats why I really need that dosage & amount again because I was living a normal life with it & idk what to do to get my doc or a doc to increase the little 2mg Valium I‚Äôm on to 10mg Valium 

*TL;DR: psyche-doc gives me 
Valium 2mg x3 and won‚Äôt increase dose at all b/c ‚Äú10mg way too much!!‚Äù, so I talk to primary care doc about this issue & he says ‚Äúme no write benzos to U! talk to psyche-doc about that‚Äù after explaining how I already discussed with psyche-doc.. primary care doc writes me Lexapro knowing I‚Äôm prescribed Zoloft by psyche-doc and I tell him I tried many SSRI, TCAs, etc. and how Lexapro made me suicidal; I also ask if it‚Äôs even safe to take Lexapro + Zoloft together in the 1st place because they‚Äôre both SSRI antidepressants. He tells me ‚Äúnah Lexapro isn‚Äôt SSRI or antidepressant, it‚Äôs only used for specifically panic/social anxiety, and it‚Äôs & anxiety pill that will 100% work, when I see you next appointment in 3 months you‚Äôll feel great/so much better!‚Äù I respectfully thank him for his amazing practice & for helping me with this! ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm here for, to be your doctor!‚Äù..... crazy or what? How do I get my Valium increased to the dose that works perfectly for me? It seems I have no luck at all or I must be saying something wrong or being too nice??? I can‚Äôt take it at all anymore I run out my Valium 3 weeks short at the baby dose I‚Äôm on!*",1540365559.0

The other day I went out to him with $3, literally, and he threw me a dub and just told me to keep it. Tonight I went to him with $6 and again, threw me a dub and just exhaled but gave it to me anyway. I‚Äôve been going to him, in February it‚Äôll be 3 years, and he‚Äôs just such a good guy. 

This is irrelevant to anything, but I wanted to ask you guys: what do you think is worse? Not having a ride to your dealer when/ if they don‚Äôt drive, or not having money?

The next day I had nothing except for my seeds to use as meds and they were complete TRASH! Before I knew they were complete TRASH, I ordered 8 ducking POUNDS, so now I‚Äôm sitting on 8 lbs of complete garbage!

I‚Äôm looking at a prostate cancer diagnosis in a two weeks after my emergency biopsy to get the final oncological results. The PSA test results were very high for my age and the other tests ruled out all infection or kidney damage, the emergency MRI cleared the risk of it spreading to my bones, but the emergency CT scan and internal checks showed that the organ is massive, quite solid like a rock, and much larger on the right side - so large that it pulled both my groin muscles after I got the flu shot and it puffed up exponentially.

9quj2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9quj2t/kratom_dosages/,4,https://redd.it/9quj2t,vu47,Kratom dosages?,"For those of you who use kratom, either for opioid withdrawal or for recreational / pain management purposes, or both, what's a common quantity for you to use in a day?

I started with about 15 g a day (2.5 g six times) a few days ago, but now am doing 30 g a day (10 grams three times)]. My pain is the lowest it has been in ages, my opioid withdrawal is completely mitigated - even better than it was when I lived in the US and was on methadone - and I feel great: not incredibly high, mind you, but very comfortable and relaxed.

I really struggle to take care of myself when on the opioid rollercoaster: for example, I usually - when my addiction / dependence is managed properly - try to eat very healthy and exercise regularly, as well as engage in a variety of academic research and pursuits that I love. When my addiction is not properly managed and I go even into mild withdrawal, feeding myself becomes too hard so I just lay there hating myself and life.

For any kratom users here: have you experienced any long term detrimental side effects?

I'm just so incredibly impressed with it and am loving it. I haven't been this productive and comfortable in ages. (I've felt mildly physically uncomfortable all my life, always too hot and too cold and sweaty and just off. Opioids cure that.)

I've read a few cases of liver failure, which kind of frightens me, so I'd like to know how common / realistic this is (my liver's a little rough to start with and needs some light care) before I continue on with this. I've been using it for only five days now and am trying to plan ahead and decide if this will be a long-term opioid dependency management tool (as I would do with methadone of subs if they were available here), or a tool to wean myself off of opioids.

Best of all, it isn't awful like the trammies I get here. I hate them... they do nothing for pain, they don't feel remotely fun, and their only use is managing my primary addiction, which is to buprenorphine patches.",1540338796.0

I just really need some advice or ideas. I'm sorry if this is against the rules i just really need some help.

So a few weeks ago I was told to I had to take a random drug test for my job. I wasn't worried because the only thing I take are perks and i have a script for them and i hadn't even taken them recently. So I get a call this morning with the people saying that I test positive for H. I told them that its not possible for that and the doctor on the phone even said that the amount in my system wasn't indicative of a user, it was way lower and barely even popped the test. Apparently the cut off is 10 parts per billion and I was at 18 and a user would be in the hundreds or something like that according to him. He even said that it seemed weird and asked me if there was a chance that i was exposed to it because it was such a low amount that I could have been accidentally exposed to it somehow. The thing is i don't know how that is possible. I was at the bar the night before and was also at my friends house who i know actually uses but he didn't even do any while i was there and that was 12 hours before my test even happened. I'm trying to figure out how this could even happen. Does anyone have any ideas? Could I have been exposed to smoke somewhere or somehow my friends house 'contaminated' me? The only other thing i can think of that the house that I live at is a place i found on craigslist and i share it with 7 other people(each person has their own room) and my room has the main ac output vent. Is it possible that someone else in the house using drugs could make it get into my system? My computer is right under the vent and that's where i spend all of my time. Has anyone ever heard of something like this happening?

They've already fired me and they said i can pay to have the sample retested but they wont let me retake it. I want to see if there is any way I could fight this legally and get my job back because i know that I didn't use H and I don't want to lose my job over this shit. I want to see if there is anyway i could make them let me retake so i could show that maybe it was accidentally exposure or something like that and that my levels would be 0(but i guess that wouldn't matter if its in there air where i live but i dont even think that is possible is it?).

* I once helped my friend scrap his air conditioner in May because he wasn't using it yet that year (we got $7 for it). 
* I had a route mapped out through the city I live in that would take me by all of the pawn shops in the city getting progressively closer to the neighborhood i could cop in.  
* Used to know a guy (he recently passed at 26) who was banned from almost every store in the area for either selling them stolen merch or stealing and returning items. Banned from -  2 Home Depots, 1 Lowes, a consignment shop, EVERY WALMART and more I don't remember.
* I knew a girl that worked at Home Depot in a rough neighborhood and she was typically stationed at the return counter. Home Depot does cash returns and usually takes anything back, even without a receipt, making them a perfect target for junkies. She said there was a group of regulars she recognized who would be in once a week or even every few days to return stuff. One was a girl who's dad was a contractor, she would constantly steal materials from his warehouse (copper pipe, saw blades etc) and return them the day after he bought the stuff. There was even one instance where someone was trying to return a stolen circular saw- THEY DIDN'T EVEN TAKE IT OUT OF THE STORE! They took it off the shelf and went right to the return counter with it. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SIZE OF THE BALLS ON THIS PERSON! LOL

Never thought I would be so excited for something that should ultimately help me actually remain abstinent from opiates.

So I submitted my paperwork @ the Dr's office about 2 weeks ago and since I'm going back in tomorrow to go over my blood work results (they are also my GP) I decided to call InSupport to see if I could get a status on the CoPay assistance program.

Well, according to them I was approved! That means the monthly cost for my meds should be just $5 (I only pay $10 now), but I will be on the monthly sublocade injection.

Anyway, just got super giddy/excited hearing I was approved and wanted to share. I will ask tomorrow what the plan is, I doubt they already have the medication, but if they gave me the option I would like to start ASAP.

I'm guessing they'll make me wait 2 weeks until my normal monthly appointment to get me on the sublocade shot. Although, maybe I'll be lucky and they'll offer to start it now since I am completely stable on my suboxone as it is.

Will keep everyone updated and let you know my experience with it! May be able to start tomorrow, but I'm guessing I'll be starting around Nov 12th give or take.",1540311168.0

How would I do this?? I came up on 80mg liquid.
I‚Äôm thinking maybe take 40mg day one, then 20 the next day and 20 again the third day? Or 40, 20, 10, 10?

I‚Äôve only been using a little more than a month this time and about .5/day until this last week closer to a gram a day. ",1540281421.0

I always have to put the AC way down. Just curious cause I've never seen anyone mention it.

Also, whenever I'm nodding for like 3 min at a time I have weird ass dreams that make absolutely no sense. It's just random images and words that have no connection to each other. I feel like while I'm nodding off it all makes sense to me. Then when I come to I realize all my thoughts while nodding were completely incoherent. Then like 5 min later I'll have 0 memory of any of those dreams/thoughts. What does nodding feel like to you?",1540280944.0
