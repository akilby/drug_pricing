Been on my daily subs tho and smoke small amounts of bud. I got arrested in September with a simple poss. And I got this special accelerated program for it. Basically do a 8 week iop and they expunge the charge. Well finished the iop last week and have my final court date next Thursday. 

The IOP went well passed all my urines with a couple frozen bottles of pee (just to pass for the weed in my system). That was my 7th or 8th iop and been to inpatient treatment 5 times. I've had multiple stints with sobriety but most of those were while I was on either subs or methadone. But I always go back out eventually. Here I am again probably a couple days from relapsing once again.

Most of my relapses happen in a similar fashion. I basically get some cravings and dwell on them for a bit and eventually say fuck it. Well I've been having cravings for dope and hard and the opportunity presented itself today. Ran into an old friend that I got high with 4-5 years ago. He just moved back to my area. We exchanged numbers and both knew the implication of this. 

Only thing really preventing me at this point is lack of money. But I have a stockpile of about 30 or so subs I could start selling to get high. Idk I don't want to go back out but feel like it's only a matter of time at this point. I have it all mapped out in my head it would be so easy. Hit up my friend, tell him I got subs for sale, sell the subs and cop the dope. It wouldn't take long a couple hours at most and I could be high.

Idk why I'm even posting this I guess to see if I can get enough support to stop myself. I don't want to go on another run. Shit sucks falling back into a habit. At the same time I really just want like a gram of dope and a gram of hard and get high as fuck for a day. Only time will tell I guess. Hope everyone is doing alright.

I've had a few blog style writings in the past that were pretty successful and a few days ago my AMA on being an addict and living in the crack motel made the front page. I've been journaling lately and I'd like some feedback. I'm curious if I should continue, if anyone would actually want to read it? Without further ado...



**Unknown date**
Today was a roller coaster. Woke up arguing with Sarah, my girl. I think… I can’t really remember but that’s how most mornings begin. Smooth called and it was payday so all bets were off. I got dressed and Smooth had his sister drive to the motel to pick me up to grab my paycheck. 



I got into the back of a decent car and there was a beautiful pit bull pup in the back seat with me. Smooths sister is a bit darker than him, sometimes I’m pretty sure slim is mixed. I walked into Got Burger and put on my mask. I had to work in 90 minutes and I’m grabbing $180, like I couldn’t wait. Thankfully the mask works and no one suspects anything deceitful.


I originally wanted a $60 of heroin and $20 of crack. The boss overpaid me by about $40 so I decided to get more. Unfortunately he only had $60 worth of heroin on him, some drug dealer. He offered a huge rock of crack if I spent an extra $20 so I went ahead and spent the $100 like a stupid addict. I had just told them I don’t even like more than $20 worth of crack and almost never buy more than that. Smooth insisted I “smoke the crack, man, don’t shoot it” and went on a long tangent about how I needed to start “loving life” and once again mentions when Brian shoved ice cubes down my pants. Finally he hands over the drugs.


We walked from my job a few blocks to his uncles, who also smokes crack. Since he was letting me use his pipe and house I told him I would smoke the rock with him. First things first though, I shoot the dope in his bathroom. Sarah’s Christmas present to me was a beautiful red hoodie with built in headphones for draw strings and I use these as a turniquette. This makes me feel guilty. The dope is surprisingly good for smooth who usually sells poor quality heroin. The $60 isn’t that horrible sized either, but it is on the small side. This dope was the first dope that felt like real heroin, and not fentanyl, in a long time. I was able to do a lot without being in sleepy zombie mode or ODed. The high was more euphoric and long lasting. I did finish the whole $60 in the hour I was there though. I let both smooth and his uncle smoke my rock and end up getting 4 giant hits off it myself making it not a bad deal. My ears ring but i don’t throw up.


As I expected I shouldn’t have bought that much crack. Only the first 2 hits were good. It leaves me shaky with a lot of anxiety despite the heroin kicking strong. Smooths uncle makes a big deal of me sharing the crack and offers to have his man drop me off a pack for free to try. Smooth flips out at this attempt to poach me as a customer but it doesn’t escalate. I looked at my phone and saw I was going to be late for work and did the last of my shit.


Thankfully the crack was fading enough so I could at least appear normal on the outside when I entered work. Or at least normal enough where no one said anything. I work with a bunch of straight laced Palestinians who would have cut into me if they suspected I was high. I genuinely love them. Eventually the shaking and anxiety cease and I can enjoy the heroin. I don’t get why I even speedball since every time I do just heroin it’s better. 


I do very well at work for awhile but quickly become emotional as is common with heroin. My post on reddit had gotten 8k upvotes and was huge. I know it sounds lame but I was really proud of this. I see myself as such a loser, never been able to create art. But I’ve had a few really huge forum threads over the years. If I compiled it all it’d probably be 100 pages of a book and have 500k-1 million views, ten thousand comments. Not just random message board posts, legit essay style pieces and long responses to questions as well as tons of short stories. All chronicling this horrible addiction of mine. It’s weird to be such a nobody in life… but online so many people enjoy my writing and wish me support. It hurts me that Sarah dislikes this. It’s not even her making fun of it, calling it lame. It’s that she just doesn’t care… she wouldn’t take the time to bother to read it unless it pertained to her and she could be upset with it. When I told her about the numbers of views and comments I achieved all she said was not to write about her.  


I tried to apologize to her for some past wrongs and she tells me I bother her with the shit I say. I don’t get why she’s with me as it just seems like she hates me. As the night got worse I told her I was struggling and asked for some help, maybe just to be assured I’m loved but she has gone to sleep and doesn’t respond.


The whole shift at work I was tossing and turning in my brain over spending the last $70 of my paycheck or getting Sarah a gift. I ended up confessing my cravings to my coworkers who took my phone and made it so smooths number was both deleted and blocked so I couldn’t find it again. I wish I wouldn’t have gotten high in the first place. I will likely have minor withdrawals tomorrow. I am still proud I won that battle though. Before this at work I got very emotional and upset inside after being minorly chastised for making a few small mistakes on orders. I kept an calm face throughout though. After Khalid deleted Smooths numbers I gave him a hug. I make $8 an hour under the table cooking burgers for a Palestinian who did 10.5  years in the feds for money laundering. I work with 2 stoners, a gay Albanian immigrant whose Americanized, one dude fresh from Yemen who I am good friends with despite him not knowing much English. The rest are Palestinians. Being around so many middle easterners reminds me of high school but I’ve grown to really love the people I work with. All the wonderful Muslim people who wish me the best and provide real friendship make me question some of the political beliefs I subscribe to. I am in no way conservative, at least not like other conservatives. I’m not one of these people calling for us not to basically ignore all these acts of terror. However when I see articles that reflect this viewpoint they seem hateful and I question if they’re on the right side. Too many Muslim people have just been too good of friends to me throughout life.


I came back to Derrick and Dustons and smoked. Derrick has been taking bars for days and it makes me sad to see addictive behavior in him as he just generally seemed like a stoner. 


I get picked up at 11am and have to get some sleep. Maybe I’ll get Kratom tomorrow. I hope that for once Sarah and I can just get along and I can enjoy being with her. Maybe I’ll just submit to everything just to avoid fighting. I think I will, half to see that happens, and half because I want to remember what it’s like to just spend the night with the girl I love without arguing, just enjoying each other’s company. I doubt it will happen but the goal sounds nice so maybe it will be worth eating shit. The downside is that there is a very slim chance this will work and we’ll probably still fight and I’ll have played yellow for nothing.
Best of luck 



**1-18 2:17am**


Just got out of work and I’m smoking a joint at Derricks. Today was a rough day at work but my drug intake has been greatly reduced. On Monday I did probably 5 or 6 $20 packs, Tuesday I did 3, and today just 1. I’m going to try to just take Kratom tomorrow and ween myself down. I feel retarded for getting a physical addiction again but I’ve done it a million times so I’m apathetic to any regret. 


I’ve been getting the $20s through Rachal whose been living with me in the motel. She’s a butch lesbian so it’s not weird and although there are some idiosyncrasies of hers I dislike for the most part she is easy to live with. She’s been trustworthy and I enjoy her company so I’ve let her stay.


The dope she gets is weird, but good. It’s little light red rocks that kind of look like make up. It even draws up pink/light red. It comes in little tiny ziplock bags like I used to see in east Detroit. The guy lives right next to the motel and most times we can cop within 20 or 30 minutes total. This feels like real heroin, I’ve gone irresponsibly hard on it two days in a row and didn’t fall out. Instead I was nodding hard, even when standing up. It remind me of when I first came home from prison and was getting high like in the old days. I’ve been booking Rachel up fat in exchange for using her connection.


I have to get to college Wednesday. If I don’t get my classes set now I never will. I’m fairly confident I will get it done but you never know with a junky.


I’ve got to lower my weed and drug intake then quit. I’m going to start making a daily goals list. Today I didn’t smoke a cigarette.


Today is the first day of the week I go into work without any heroin in me and it’s a 9 hour shift. It’s going to be hard not to smoke weed after that one. I do notice Kratom holds me over better than heroin.


**1-18**

Not a bad first day off heroin, but I only took the Kratom 3 hours ago. The 30 half gram capsules of Kratom make me actually feel slightly good, above sober baseline, but yet the heroin withdrawal creeps below the surface. Even though my mood is decent and my outlook positive there’s a tainted feeling running deep within my bones that I’ve come to associate with coming off a heroin binge more than withdrawal. If I have been clean a few months and binge for 2 days I will not feel withdrawal but more of a hangover. The main symptom of which is a generally scummy, sickly feeling, but nothing close to actually being sick. It serves as a strong warning I never heed.


It’s 4 hours after the Kratom dose now and I’m hitting the other vices hard. I’ve drank two large glasses of real coffee and I find I crave instant and feel the familiar nostalgia of the coffee I used to make in prison. I rounded scoop Keefe Alturo blend instant coffee, 2 non sugar sweetener, and a scoop of whey protein.


**1-19** 


Relapsed today kind of bad. I blew $150 in about an hour. I barely got anything out of it so at least it won’t kick my withdrawals back in too long. My grandmother sent me some money so it wasn’t a huge financial loss and I’ll still be able to meet my goal of buying an Xbox one. 


I woke up after after maybe 3 hours of sleep already in pretty mild withdrawals. Smooth had been calling me which was my first trigger. I was supposed to go to College today but had no bus fare and was withdrawing too hard. When I come back from home Monday I’m going to grab some Kratom and get a ride to college so I can’t procrastinate any further. This is my last week and I absolutely have to make this happen.


I ended up caving and had my grandma send me $120 and called Smooth. He was over in about ten minutes which is really rare for the doorman. I spent the $10 I had on me and the shot took me off E. After all the dope I did I never got much beyond that. 


When I went to pick up the Western Union I ran into Rachel who was on her way to cop. I gave her $20 to grab me one of her bags. When she returned with it she told me her dealer had ran out of baggies and put both of ours in the same bag which was a lie and a way for her to take half of the $20 I paid for. I had trusted her more than this but it didn’t surprise me when she did it. I don’t plan on fucking with her anymore.


I ended up getting a dime of dope, followed by a $50 more dope, a $20 of crack, a $15 of heroin and $10 of crack, followed by another $15 of heroin and $10 of crack on front. So now I have to see him to pay him back. I’m going to try my hardest not to get more which shouldn’t be hard since his dope sucks. If I had a reliable connect for good dope I’d be a lot worse off right now.


I can’t stand being a slave to so many substances and I don’t know how I’m going to kick them all in time for school. The withdrawal won’t be too bad and I might just maintain on Kratom. I just have to come to the decision not to pick up the phone and call the dopeman. Once I get in school I’ll have something to drive me. I moved here to get away from drugs but your vices have a way of finding you.


I remember how I found heroin here in Ypsi. I was living at the ¾ house at the time but was already doing Kratom and smoking weed. I was walking home from from work one day and saw a skinny dude with coke bottle glasses smoking a cigarette. I needed a light so I struck up a conversation. As we were smoking he asked if I smoked herb, I assured him I did. He then asked me if I did acid and once again I said yes. I wanted some bud so I went up to his apartment and scored. I deduced he was a junky pretty quick but it was a week or two before I made the call and asked if he could get dope. That was the beginning of all my serious problems here in Ypsi. 


Brian’s apartment was basically a trap. It was technically his girlfriend, Katy’s apartment but he ran it. Brian was something of a professional middle man, the type that supports his habit by having both an amazing connect and a pretty good clientele of people unable to score for themselves. Dealers would often hang out at the apartment to sell as well. I went through Brian for a while before he fucked me over on some packs. I ended up meeting Rachel at Brian’s but didn’t actually hang out with her until later.


Sarah and I have been getting along and she has a job interview Monday so I’m very proud of her. For all the problems we’ve had I know she really loves me and has stuck by me through numerous county jail bits and parole/probation violation programs. I see her Sunday and I won’t be feeling too well from lack of heroin so I hope we can get along. When I’m half dead from withdrawal it always makes me feel better just to have her there with me.


I need to make a plan. Today is Friday and I’ve already fucked up today. A bottle of 30 Kratom caps is $10. I’m going to try to buy 3 tomorrow for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Tomorrow will be a rough shift with only Kratom but Sunday shouldn’t be too bad since I don’t work. Monday I’ll take my Kratom and go to college to sign up for classes. If I need to get another bottle to make it through work then so be it. Once I get 3 days taking just Kratom I should be over the worst of it. I refuse to dose Kratom more than once a day which means about half of a day is spent in withdrawal since the Kratom doesn’t hold me a full 24.


I’ve been stressing about Sarah tonight as is typical after drug use. When I’m in the right state of mind I don’t stress more than I need to. I worry about her being with other men but more I worry about her not loving or wanting me anymore. Like maybe she just talks to me and sees me once a week as a favor to me. I can’t expect her to stay in every night though, we aren’t even technically together. It’s hard to hold down a girl when you aren’t physically there. In reality she makes time for me me every week and we talk every day so I shouldn’t worry so much. Lately I’ve been the one to text first though and that sucks. I just want her to be totally in love with me again. Sometimes I get these fleeting thoughts of suicide that tell me people would understand if I killed myself. Like Sarah would understand how much I love her and how much it hurt not to have her heart. Maybe the courts, judges, and POs would understand how hard of a battle it is for me to get clean, such a battle that I killed myself instead of fighting. These thoughts fade though and even in withdrawal I don’t feel suicidal. Withdrawal makes me apathetic to everything… my life, my problems with Sarah. Sometimes i wonder if it feels better to be half-high and suicidal or withdrawing and empty. 


It felt therapeutic to write that. I want people to eventually read these and I feel like writing about my girl problems is boring. There’s nothing more pathetic than a clingy boyfriend and I don’t want to be that.

On a lighter note things were pretty wild at the crack motel today. I heard 4 instances of prostitutes fucking loudly with the fake screams and moans common to prostitutes. Then when I was smoking a cigarette in the hallway I saw a couple exit a room and begin arguing over crack.
“Give me my half! I have the shooter”

“Break it and half and let me pick mine!” 

“You aren’t getting the pipe until you break me off!”

Eventually the girl busted out the crack pipe to her mans dismay, as they were only a few feet from me.

“He doesn’t care! He lives in Ypsi!” She said in regards to me seeing them smoke. I had just taken a hit myself, little did they know. I left them to argue and as I was walking back to the room I saw the Indian female manager quickly moving towards then and was glad I wasn’t going to be around for that.


It’s almost the end of the work shift now and I asked Derrick if he wanted to smoke after but he’s just going home and going to sleep so it looks like I’m going to be all alone in the motel room. The room feels like a jail cell during these times and I’m certain I’m going to break down and start crying the moment I’m alone. I think I’ll put on a podcast and try to forget my situation. Hopefully I’ll sleep late and won’t have to suffer too many hours alone by myself. There’s nothing to look forward to until Sunday when I see Sarah. I think if I looked at things objectively I’d see that it’s over, that it’s been over, that it wasn’t that good to begin with. I don’t want to accept that because I couldn’t imagine feeling more alone than I already do.


I think I’ll post these on the opiates subreddit and see what kind of response I get.

7rp2q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rp2q1/that_binge_last_week_on_sleep_deprivation_and/,0,https://redd.it/7rp2q1,sloan_fitch,That Binge Last Week. On sleep deprivation and being on time for work.,"I was on day two of a dope binge. The night before I barely slept three hours if that much because I was ripping bag after bag. After a long work day I went to visit a friend's house for a few hours ~~to work on something~~  and I didn't get home 'til a little after about 5AM. When I was ready to leave my friend was nodding out in standing position and I was just like ""dude I'm leaving now, 'nuff stalling.""

I think it was the night before where I was at another friend's house working on a project with them but I got home much earlier, a bit before 3AM.

Anyway, back to that night where I got home at 5AM. It was day two of my binge and I was already quite sleep deprived. An hour early while I was sitting at my friend's kitchen table I kept snapping into ""day dream"" states. I don't know what you call it but it also continued once I got home to my desk. 


&nbsp;

These daydreams are always peculiar but usually nothing negative. This time they were a bit off-putting. Like dark flashbacks, but they weren't flash backs to any thing in particular. It's like one second I'm in a day dream where I'm at work talking to a person, then I'm back at my desk and it feels like I was just at a different place at a different time of the day. Sort of disorienting I suppose. Despite nothing intrusive happening in my thoughts, I just felt negative as fuck. Maybe it was because I lacked control. Maybe it was because it was the second day of sleep deprivation. I don't remember two a day dope binge with sleep deprivation in the past. I usually get a good night's sleep on the second night regardless of my dope consumption.

&nbsp;

Well, I really don't know how to describe it but I felt ""dark"" while fading in and out of these innocuous daydreams. Aside from it being the second night of sleep deprivation, I did consume a lower amount of dope than I did on day one.

Maybe the reduction in dope compared to the prior day affected my serotonin levels? Not quite withdrawal, just some psych effects.

&nbsp;

Well I had work at 11AM. After eating at 5:15 I went to my desk to watch videos and digest my meal. I planned to go to bed soon. Next thing I know it's 7AM, I must've fallen asleep. I intended on getting up to go to bed but dozed off to sleep once more in chair in an upright position.


Woke up once more, at 9AM and probably said, ""ahh shit, time to get up."" So I did, and proceeded to put a Jimmy Dean sandwich in the microwave and made a cup of coffee on the Keurig. While the coffee was brewing, I went back to my desk to watch some videos and let the coffee cool down a little bit.


Then bam, I'm still at my desk but when I look at the time it's 10:58. This time I definitely said ""ahh shit..."" I had to be at work in two minutes, it takes me thirty minutes to get to work. I was surprised by that, I've never fallen back asleep after having physically gotten up to walk to my kitchen and sitting down. Perhaps this swivel chair is dangerously comfortable. 

Lesson, I don't know. Just thought it was a funny story. I'll set my wrist alarm next time well before bed as part of a alarm contingency plan. In fact I'll do that right now... Set four alarms on the wrist + the ones on my phone to ensure a single hit of the snooze bar does not defeat me in the AM.",1516434079.0

It's all scripted. I've never gotten into weed. Lol, that sounds funny, but never really liked smoking. Never cigs or whatever. I've smoked weed a few times, but it's been a long time.

What's your thoughts on the combo? Or what are your thoughts on weed as almost a replacement with some Kratom some nights to break up the opiates.

Trying to enhance movies/music/podcasts. I love waking up early, taking some oxy and throwing a podcast on (fatman on batman is my current fave) It's amazing. Used to use alcohol to achieve the same goal, enhance something else

So I'm just a nerd who is curious. Never expected to be addicted to anything. I have a great weed hookup for quality stuff according to a family member who is a super stoner. Maybe I'll try making edibles.

this happened years ago. probably 2014. i'm not the best storyteller but i think this one's worth sharing.


i was living with my mom and brother at the time and had just come home from picking up a rather large amount by my standards (0.75g - in 3 separate 0.25g bags). so i went in the bathroom and did my thing, got high, and went to room to chill. mostly browsing reddit and chilling with the dog.



then i realized that i was missing the 2 x 0.25g bags. i started worrying a bit and retraced my steps from my room to the bathroom and back, repeatedly. scoured my bedroom too. shit! what if my mom or brother found it!? i finally came to the conclusion that the dog must have eaten them and was slowly starting to come to terms with the fact that my dog might die and it would all be my fault. and my family would find out i was using again (i was hiding it from them at the time). idk if any of you guys have ever been in a situation like this but it fucking SUCKED! i love my dog to death and it slowly started to dawn on me that i'm gonna end up killing him because i was too worried about getting high to be responsible with my shit.



at this point i realized the dog was perfectly fine and would probably be showing some signs of an overdose if he had in fact eaten my dope so i started to calm down a bit. then i realized i didn't FULLY trace my steps - found my 2 bags untouched just sitting on the stairs that lead from the foyer into the main living area.

Im a long time addict, who has been usung steadily and everyday for around 8 years, currently Ive managed slightly over 2 months of clean time from Heroin.

My question is whether or not the heroin crisis is impacting highschoolers to the extreme levels which it is being shown inside the school.  I mean there must have been a warning poster, anti drug club, picture, artwork, or story every 15 feet about heroin or opiates.  It was almost as if the school was ground zero for a drug cartel or open air trap.  Kids these days are really pushing things hard if they are doing this shit instead of smoking some weed or drinking a few beers.  After seeing all that propaganda I was terrified for kids and their parents of this new generation.

This month I’ve taken less than I’m supposed to for a few days. Years ago I would blow through pills so fast it wasn’t even funny. 20-25 norcos a day plus Xanax and booze to add. I couldnt control myself. This is to all the pain patients out there. It’s possible to make them last. I have my girlfriend give me my daily doses and don’t go searching for the bottles. This is an agreement I made that was my idea. It works amazingly. No more withdrawals, no worrying about not passing drug tests, not having to supplement with kratom at the end of the month. This makes life so much easier. Anyone that calls you a hopeless addict for being in pain management has no idea what it’s like to live with that stigma. These meds make life bearable. Yeah I enjoy taking them. The joy comes from being able to function like a normal person for once. There is nothing wrong with that and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

hi guys, this is my first post on reddit and i just want to get this out somewhere so here we go. i just turned 18 and i've been abusing all opaites that i can get my hands on for about 2 months. it started with me beeing bored and looking through our medecine cabinet and finding some tramadol and codeine. i tried both of those but did not get any effect at all which is a bit wierd but anyways, a week later i was over at my cousins house and stumbeld upon some oxys 10mg that my aunt had gotten for a surgey that was completly heald and they were just laying there so i stole like 4 pills or something. i tried it later that day and i was in love. i live realy close to my cousins and i know when they get home after school and work cuz we're basicly nieghbours so a couple of days later i decided to go back and steal the whole box ( we have a spare key for thier house). the following month consisted of me being high atleast every other day, even when i was over at my friends. i used to go in to thier bathroom and snort a pill or two. some of my friends knew about my drug habbit and wanted me to stop and i did so after about a month beacuse of multiple reasons, one was that i didn't want to get physicly addicted. but i was still mentaly addicted so started to steal everything i could get my hands on when i couldn't stand a life without being high anymore. i stole coughsyroup from my grandmother (old and not in use, which dosen't justify it), tramadol from a friends dad (was prescribed in 2012 and had not been touched since, still dosen't justify it). but the one i am most ashamed is what i have been doing recently, i've been stealing from my mother who had a back surgery about 2 weeks ago and the latest time i did so was about an hour ago, and that's why i'm writing this. i'm such a fucking brat, how the fuck can a son steal her moms medication when she has done everthing for me. i can't stand my self and this is the last time i'm doing it, i don't wanna hurt my mom but i just can't help myself. what i usally do is carefully take out a pill (oxy) from the blister pack, empty out the powder and then put the empty pill back in the blister and try to make it look as if it has not been tamperd with. the reason i've been stealing and not buying from a plug is becuase i live in a very small town and i dont have a lot of money. so instead of just staying away from this shit i steal it from the ones who need it the most. I AM DISGUSTED BY MYSELF, I'M HONESTLY THE WORST PERSON EVER. i'm such a spoled fucking asshole and i don't deserve the loving mother i have.

Lol. I only get tested once a month, when I have my appt too. Pretty sweet setup really. The sub is working fine, really well actually when you consider the pressures I’ve been under, it’s probably the main thing that’s kept me from going out and just destroying myself. 

So, I am trying to stay clean, but only sort of. I still like to get high. I still have some etizolam on the way, etc. I actually found that alcohol seems to have an especially strong reaction w bupe relative to other opioids. I had one (stiff) drink around noon the other day and was pretty fucked. Mostly, tho I don’t really feel a buzz when I take my dose (8mg). And it’s only been a few days on this script (before that did about 3-4 days on subs, then a couple days with just a little tramadol, then a day and a half totally clear). 

So I know I’m gonna have to figure out how my body responds to bupe on my own, but just like ballpark figures would be helpful. Like if I want to get high, how long do I have to wait? From what I’ve read it seems like I could skip a single dose (which I’ve been taking at noon) and sleep in the next day and try to make it a few hours, then get high. My tolerance was getting out of hand at the end and I’m naturally quite tolerant, so it’s hard to believe anything could get ME high. I got a plug on some good pressed roxis tho and that fent got me decently high at the end. I figure I’ll prob get settle into some kind of routine of taking a little tolerance break and shooting fent maybe a couple times earlier in the month, but stay stable on sub most of the time. 

I do worry about my tolerance but really 8mg of sub is plenty to make me feel ok even if i do spike my tolerance a little so that should be fine. Speaking of, i actually want to experiment with lower doses, as I think there really might be something to this “less is more” shit. I took 2mg after taking 8mg for about 4 days, went to my first meeting and fucking nodded out thru the whole thing. I was so embarrassed, but I really had no idea I could get those kind of effects from 2mg of sub (??).  If I could be fine on 2-4mg I’d be able to save at least a full dose every day, which sounds awesome obviously. 

So I guess that’s the one other question, can I/how can I get a buzz off of my subs themselves, while being on sub maintenance? Like today, I’m having really bad cravings and going through some unique emotional shit I won’t have to deal with so acutely later. I was thinking of crushing up half of another tablet and railing and/or boofing some. Would that give me a buzz like taking sub when I’m clean clean? 🤔 ? Or is there a ceiling/blocking effect at play that would make that a waste? Guess it’s worth one tab to find out. I don’t think they even really mind if I use a couple extra, they scheduled my appt slightly early “in case I run out early”. They’re actually really chill, they told me explicitly that it’s okay that I’m gonna piss dirty for cannabis every time. How about if I get down to 4 or even say 2mg/day - would I be able to double THAT dose and get high?

TLDR; how long should I wait after daily 8mg dose to get normalish effects from normalish dose of dope/fent? If I get some fent and don’t wait at all I can break through if I do enough, right? (I’ve OD’d before btw, spare me) Also wondering if it’s a waste to try to rail/boot an extra 4-8mg or something like that.",1516404005.0

I am being very careful with my dosage (IV heroin from the onions) but I am not sure if I am using too little, the blockade is still in effect, or a combination of both.


For those that have used on the early tail end of vivitrol, what exactly does it feel like?  Do you still get a taste even if the high is blocked or reduced (I don't even get a taste)?  Do your pupils pin, etc.?  Be specific about what symptoms you have and do not have compared to normal.

Here's a quick rundown of the last 24 hours: My last shot was at 7 pm last night. I had to write a report that night so I took ~20 mg (at 8 pm) of meth to stay up and be productive. I stayed up until 5:30 at took 1.0mg clonazepam and 2 mg of lorazepam to fall asleep (I was starting to feel a little shitty the nut I didn't know for sure it was withdrawals). 

12pm
I woke up feeling rough, nothing too serious just lethargy, slightly aching bones and I was freezing cold despite the room being set to room temp. I had to go to work so I took 25 mg of meth to fight back the lethargy. 

Since I've gotten to work, temperature fluctuation have become noticeable and I've started dry heaving and having some stomach cramps. I've thrown up like 3 times but other than that I don't know what to think. The symptoms I just describe are the only ones I've got. 

I'm thinking the meth is overrding the other aspects. Still. I'm wary to take the sub.

I just started out my morning by having 2 5mg percocet and 2 cranberry vodkas as I always drink on opiates for a better buzz..This bag is just sitting in front of me and im alone so should I just line up a line as if it were a regular oxy with no tylenol in them or is that too fat of a line still?

If your abusing the shit out of it and take like 30G+ a day, then 1 your a fucking idiot, and 2 no shit your gonna feel pretty awful coming off. Thats an INSANE amount.

Your taking enough to stave off fucking Heroin withdrawal. 

Use this plant responsibly, you shouldnt be taking doses any higher than like 3.5g per dose and a max of 7g daily. The more kratom you take, the more antagonists you build up. Lower doses are MORE effective over time, and have far far far less side effects.

Just stop putting a bad name on this plant because your abusing it and taking enough that would hold off heroin wd’s. If your getting off a real opi, you need to taper after the first 3 days, tapering down to a reasonable level. Your tolerance goes down, and the effects increase. Its a win win. ",1516370188.0

I can honestly say I much prefer oxy... personally think the high is much better and I stay high longer. I have been planning my detox and this for awhile and have acquired a lot of stuff I hope will stave most of my withdrawals. I have one strip of suboxone, an ounce of Kratom, gabapebtin, clonidine, hydroxizine, and tramadol. I also just got put on my family's LA Fitness membership. I was wondering how I should take the meds. I plan on cutting up the suboxone... how long should I wait to take the first piece? I was thinking maybe about 12-24 hours from now and how should I divy out the other meds? I know the Kratom has to build up in our system in order to work so should I maybe start taking 2 capsules about 8 hours from now then continue with 2 capsules every four hours until this time tomorrow then increase to 4 capsules? As for the gym I plan on going to the sauna and maybe sweating out the toxins to maybe make the withdrawal process go faster? Then set a solid routine for working out... last time I got clean routine was everything... I think working out will help me tremendously in mood and general well being. I realize this is a shit post and we see at least a hundred a week on this sub but this is my one and only shitpost about getting clean I hope to make. The biggest reason for getting clean is because I am trying to get a job in a hospital/clinic setting and I want to pass my drug test on my own volition... it sucks because most hospitals in my state won't even hire you if you have nicotine in your system. I am also excited to save money. I remember last time I got clean I had more money than I knew what to do with(not really, I went out to eat A LOT) but anyways any advice any of you have for me on how to dole out the meds or any other advice I would greatly appreciate.

Even being a shitty middleman gives you that control and upper hand it's a dog eat dog world and the way to the top is ruthless. How submissive you will be or how willing you are to get to the top is what drives many to do the most disgusting things.

7rwblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rwblm/5_more_days/,15,https://redd.it/7rwblm,JustWeightOnIt,5 more days,"I’ve been on probation for over 3 years. While I’ve used throughout that time this last year i had to really cut back. the first 2 years while it was only felony Probation so they didn’t really drug test all that much. The only reason i went back to jail was on me. It was because I got arrested for a failure to maintain lane that resulted in a wreck. I had 2 seizures from benzo WD so I got kicked out of jail. Did a little over a month (3 for 1 since I was a trustee) for that. 

Anyways the last year I was on misdemeanor and in my county those people don’t fuck around. Drug tests started at twice a month. Well I failed the first one for xanax (rx’d), pot, and alcohol. They saw my script for the xanax and let that slide but they still wanted to lock me back up for the pot and booze. I ended up running away to rehab for 3 months and the judge let me off with a warning. Then I missed a test on accident (I just forgot to call in) and he bumped my testing up to once a week.

About a couple months ago they found oxy in my system. That’s because the original tests they used looked for “opiates” which really meant anything that breaks down in to morphine. I figured that out before they did and kept using until the pulled the old switcheroo without telling me. She (my PO) called me and told me she was gonna revoke the rest of my time (like 6 months). I was freaking out until I got my prescription list from my pharmacy and saw I had a script of oxy 5s from a wisdom tooth extraction a year prior to all this. I told her I had oxys for an ongoing pain that I needed surgery to fix but since I was in school i didn’t have the time. She fucking believed me! 

So I continued to pop oxys a handful of times the last couple months. I did do some speedballs a couple months back but that was once the day after a drug test so I knew I would Be clean the next test because they reduced the amount to twice a month. 

So that brings me to today, 5 days away from being put on non report (no testing, no monthly meetings, NO MORE PAYMENTS — $50 per meeting and $35 for each drug test) and guys/girls I couldn’t be happier. I’ll probably cut back on the oxy consumption and pick up some high quality Mary Jane and some extracts(my girlfriend just bought a $4000 piece to smoke from and I still have my mothership) I might have a couple beers as well to top it all off. I’m so glad I don’t have to rely on oxys to get a buzz when I want.

the real risk people are overlooking is hitting your head if you fall down - i have done that multiple times as well as down the staircase twice, in a classroom once, and twice while i was driving where i wrecked into guardrails on the interstate going 50-60 mph. both times i hit the windshield with my head and cracked it as well as concussing myself unconcicous. i would of defiinitely died and went thru the windshield had i not worn a seatbelt but i always do wear one thank god.

so yea i think i should be dead but im still here and i wonder why a lot of the time and it depresses me for some reason.  i was a very bright person but these concussions and seizures have definitely fucked my cognition up a lot.  i feel like i have super ADHD and even dyslexia",1516516379.0

We have had a mutual understanding that if any of our friends were going through a hard time, we'd give them a place to crash and help them out. 

There's an old friend of the bf's, let's call him Bill. He used to do dope, but has been clean for a few years. Bill has had a rough time in life for the past three years. His long term gf left him, and ever since can't keep a place to live, even though he works as a bartender in a major city five nights a week. What few teeth he's got are not looking good. He's skinny and puffy faced. 

Bill told the bf that the apartment he'd been staying in was locked shut by the marshall because the person he'd been paying rent to had taken the money and skipped town. Bill is supposedly sleeping at the bar a few times a week after his shift. He sometimes shows up at 2am, or sometimes shows up at 10am and then goes up to the the attic space where we have a spare bed and crashes up there all day.

The second night he crashed here, he stayed up there for 15 hours. He came down to pee, I chatted with him briefly but he cut that short, saying he had to get going and try to get his stuff out of the apartment somehow. He went back up to the attic, and.... there was silence for the following hour and a half. Then he came back down and said he'd fallen back asleep. He went out, traveled over an hour all the way to his work to see if he was needed (instead of just calling?) and then came back two hours later.

A different night he left our apartment at 5am because he said he couldn't sleep, and didn't return for a day or two.

Bill came by two days ago and smelled like a homeless person. No exaggeration. It wasn't normal BO or staying in the same clothes for a few days. It was intense. It was the kind of smell that people get off the bus to avoid. I don't understand how he can even be allowed to work like that. I understand that he doesn't have access to his clothes and whatnot, but he can borrow something of my bf's, and we have a washing machine in my building. Or, fuck, why not clean your shit in the sink, even?!

Nothing about this guy doesn't scream full blown ""junkie"" to me. He doesn't hang out with the bf when he's here, he just goes up to the attic.  

For the past week and change he's been claiming that he's getting sick. Some kind of flu. 

I've spoken to my bf about my concerns, but he's firmly on the side of optimism. He could be sleeping a lot because of depression. He might be getting sick because he's sleeping at his work. 

Tonight Bill told me he kept waking up more and more sick. He's got a fever. I ordered us food, he said he'd like soup. When it arrived, he decided against eating and went back upstairs. 

I do not want to put my boyfriend in the position to have to throw his old friend out into the cold. If Bill is struggling with drugs, I would gladly let him stay here to kick, and support him as much as we can. I just had two very close people to me die of overdoses last summer. If I can help someone out of this hell, I will.

But if he's at the point where he can't keep a place to stay, is smelling like a homeless person, and is lying about his situation, that's a dangerous level of addiction to have in my home. I am poor, and can't afford to have anything of mine be hocked for drugs. I wouldn't even take it personally. Being a junkie is like having a demon possess you. He's not going to be in control of his better judgement.

Sorry this is a bit rambly.

What would you suggest as a not shitty way of dealing with this situation? What are some ways I could determine conclusively if drug use is the culprit? What is the best way to approach this? I have gone up to the attic and looked around once, but saw no blood or wax paper. The boyfriend said Bill would probably not shoot, though. There's no vomiting thus far, either. 

I just... I know what it is to feel utterly alone and abandoned, and I don't want Bill to feel that way. But I also don't want to end up in a bad situation.

TLDR; I think I have a junkie crashing with me. He's an old friend of my boyfriend's. What do I do?
_______________

UPDATE: Ok, so now I have proof he's using, as I just went up to the attic to shut off the lights, looked around, and found the orange cap to a hypo. My boyfriend is at work until after midnight, and Bill is supposedly coming back here in the near future, but who knows? fuck.",1516515952.0

Does my experience sound normal to you all who have tried/succeeded in stopping?,"So I started by taking 8 mg suboxone & taking one (two times I took 2 a day) per day. After a week I realized I had zero desire to even take an opiate of any kind. I was in SUCH a great mood (definite a positive change in my personality). 
I felt like I was finally back to my normal self. Working, having fun with friends, being more social and feeling more confident, not to MENTION actually having money to spend on shit other than pills pills pills.

The following week after I started I decided to take ONE sub every OTHER day. I took one 3 days ago and haven’t taken one since & still have no desire to or any withdrawal symptoms or anything like that. Could it be over? I’m sure in a couple days I’ll know for sure but this process has been pretty easy for me so far. Anyone else have it like that?

I was taking about 100mg of roxy daily for about 2 years and lortabs/perks for about two years before that. So 4 years total taking pills almost daily.",1516504270.0

The 17th was the last time I had a shot of heroin. It’s been a loooong year and a half but I’m damn proud of myself. And I successfully used pain meds while giving birth to my first child last June, only because I didn’t expect to have a c-section. But, I’m also on deferred disposition and court ordered in sober living. So honestly I’m not sure what’s actually keeping me sober, however I could’ve easily gotten high because my sober house BARELY drug tests. I mean like once a month or two. 

There’s a part of me that really does want to stay clean, but a stronger side that’s telling me I can manage using again. I keep telling myself it was never that bad, and I didn’t use long enough, or my bottom wasn’t low enough. But I don’t have to experience that suffering if I choose not to. My life is pretty fucking good, and if the only thing I’m worrying about now is losing sleep due to a small child then I’ll take it.

I’ve spent the last week on a little oxycodone bender. Had some ancient 5mgs on hand from a surgery, and boredom with my sobriety got the best of me.

I know, FIVE MILLIGRAMS. I even cut em in half most of the time. But I’m very small (5’ and 100lb) and haven’t had any chemical fun, not even a drink, in several months. For the last 6 days, I’ve had between 10-20mg every day, spaced out enough to feel just a bit happier and lighter between waking and bedtime. It was fun!

Today, all day, I’ve had what feels almost exactly like a particularly nasty booze hangover. Stupid, anxious, lethargic, etc.

My question is how long you think this will last? All the info I’m finding online regards higher doses and/or longer-term use, so I’m hoping an expert in here will be able to tell me I’ll be ok come Monday? Would a little tapering help, or just drag this out?

His phone was off one day after telling me if he kills himself it's because he's being forced to go to inpatient treatment and I was worried about his well-being.

Two years ago my ex od'd and I got an ambulance there immediately and her life was spared. So they decided to take her to the hospital to make sure everything was ok. 
    There was no dope or needles or anything like that around so the cops were pissed and found a box of weed pipes under her couch and decided to take me straight to jail over it. It's seriously some bullshit. I paid a lawyer $1,000 and he got it reduced to a littering ticket instead of just getting it dropped. Fine whatever. I paid him and his job was done and all I had to do was pay the court $150 and it's all good. Well I missed the payment date and my lawyer decides to file a motion to withdraw from my case. He's got my 1,000 bucks and now I'm being charged with whole original charges which were possession of marijuana and paraphernalia even though there wasn't even any weed there. 
I'm just so pissed because I just got out of a 72 hour lockdown over it and now have to start the whole trial again. I'm gonna use a different lawyer this time and hopefully just get it dismissed. Its fucked because they even wrote in the report that I didn't live there and the box wasn't in plain sight either. How am I the one responsible for those pipes? There's not even proof I was using other then just being there I guess. 

TLDR: saved someone's life from an od in their own home and subsequently went to jail for their weed pipes.

Please stay safe homies, I love you all :)

PS I'm only 20 so, to my fellow young junkies, don't kid yourselves into thinking it only happens to older folks

And I'm really sorry if this has come across as patronising in any way, shape or form, it's genuine concern not an attempt at a lecture or any of that preachy bullshit

So  I've been pretty fucking broke as of late. Not because of drugs, per se but life in general. Expensive family illnesses (plural) no hours at work, etc. I've taken up begging from time to time - not highway offramp with a sign sort of begging but asking folks at gas stations and other places in town.

I've undertaken this several times now, in various states of dress and with various stories - most bullshit and some 100% true and can tell you guys what worked and what didn't.

None of this should be a surprise to any of you but the better you dress the better the payout, or rather, the higher the frequency of payout. The worse you dress/appear the worse your returns will be, regardless of your story.

I usually use the gas storyline:

""Hey *really* sorry to bother you (look really, REALLY embarrassed and **super** uncomfortable) but I just called my wife and after calling me an idiot, (insert chuckle) told me that I left my wallet at home next to the front door on the little table and now I'm stuck here with no way to get home and I live about 25 minutes away. Do you *happen* to have a few bucks or enough for a gallon or two of gas I could borrow? I'm *extremely* uncomfortable asking like this but I really don't know what else to do.""

It's a pretty good patter, I think, but really misses as much as it hits in regard to actual cash. I've had people put $20 in my tank off of their card, one guy filled my tank entirely which was nice since I'm always out of gas anyway.

Generally I end up with $2-$5 after trolling for quite a while which sucks.

Today I put on black dress slacks, a Polo/Izod shirt with the first button buttoned, white t-shirt underneath and decent shoes.
I immediately felt like I was legitimate. Like, no matter what story I was about to tell was the *truth* because I looked and felt like someone legitimate.

Today's story was this: (I'm changing the career to protect my personal life)

""Hey boss/sir/man/buddy/hon I'm a Network Administrator/Computer guy that is in town working on a company's computer and the owner left for the day and forgot to pay me. The office assistant and I haven't been able to reach her/him for the last couple hours and I'm stuck in town without any gas and live way over in <some-ville>. Can you spare a few bucks so I can get back that way?""

**additional banter**
""I don't think it was intentional, I just think she forgot that she needed to be there when I finished the work.""

""The secretary and I had been trying to reach her for a good couple hours before she had to go home herself and now I'm just freaking stuck here.""

This last banter yielded me $25 in about an hour which was all I was looking for. It felt like an honest situation and the people I pitched it to seemed engaged in the story as well.

I basically dressed for the part. If you look like just an ""Office Joe""/Yuppie type, people are much more likely to feel a sense of camaraderie with you and empathy towards your situation.

I'm going to run out before this month's refill. That means awful Opana WD and possibly having issues with the clinic I go to. Dad and I live several states apart but have never lost a bit of our closeness. We speak on the phone frequently. It's good to have someone who knows EXACTLY what you're going through with chronic pain, especially when it's close family. I finally broke down on the phone and told him what's going on (not quite the full extent; he doesn't need to know I'm already in WD. Knowing my Dad he could tell just by the way I sounded, though).

What does my awesome Dad do?

Immediately offer to get 12 in the mail to me Friday night before the post office closes so I will have them by Monday. I'll be mailing some of mine back up to him so he won't miss his pill count and he'll be saving me from the special hell that is WD. I was bawling my eyes out on the phone thanking him, telling him ""you don't have to do this, I've gone through WD before, I don't want to fuck up your pill count"" and his only response was ""I love you, and I'm your Dad, I'm not going to let you hurt if I can help it.... now please let me get off the phone so I can get these to you"".

So now I'm just waiting for the mail to get here on Monday. I'm learning that WD is easier to handle when you know you'e got something coming to you. I feel much more relaxed and much more able to internalize the idea that this feeling isn't going to last forever (or even a full 10 days like my WD usually do). He'll never see it but thanks for the rescue Dad. I owe you one. <3

The difference is startling. I know ideally I would like to measure opiate users rather than population but it was not possible. Regardless the difference is phenomenal. 

I dont know if its because we have no culture of oxy type drugs, fent is rare here, naloxone is freely available to addicts, methadone is free to any opiate addict and there is a range of harm reduction services free of charge. The difference is frightening though.",1516546435.0

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals.

But I got back and am trying to set up my old/customers and old/new plugs. 

Anyways, I got a new connect yesterday that has gunpowder for a great price (I'll get a pic when I get more). I've been sick all day so I was trying to figure something out whether it was middling, borrowing a few dollars, etc. I had a friend call around noon saying if he was able to grab something, he would stop by and help me out. Hours go by and his truck apparently ""broke down"" and couldn't make it. So I'm bummed at this point.

I message a few more people and someone said they would get a little because I needed help. YES! Turns out, she was helping 2 people with this dope. Not only was she getting me well, but a friend of hers had a really bad day due to her boyfriend beating her and then going to jail. So she was stuck outside with her cat & dog dopesick. And the only way my friend would get her to agree to come with her was to get the dope. 

So, she comes and picks me up and my dude doesn't answer....shit. my main guy and his girl live like 2 blocks away from the new guy. So I call the girl and she's waiting for her bf to get home to grab bth because she only has china which my friend doesn't want (smoker). Says she will call as soon as he gets there to meet us. I'm thinking ""fuck, now I'm not gonna get well and I'm gonna get dropped off"".

So we wait while I'm trying to get a hold of my new guy. The girl ends up calling RIGHT WHEN my friend wants to leave. YES!!! 

So she meets us and I get the dope for my friend (BTH). She happened to be cooking up a speedball when I got in the car. This whole time I'm thinking I'll be able to hit t he foil a couple times and that's it (I shoot). I asked her if I could grab a bit of the china to get well (we're actual childhood friends) and she says sure so I grab it from her purse and open it. She says ""hold on"". She had sucked up her 70-80 units and gives me about 30! 

FUCK YES FOR FRIENDS THAT SELL!!!! 

I end up getting a small bit from my friend as well for going with her to get her friend that had the domestic violence issue earlier today. 

Sorry for the long post, but it turned my day around completely. I just wanted to share my only JJ save.

My prescribed dose right now is 320 mg oxycodone extended release and 300 mg oxycodone instant release (yes, I know I could sell those for thousands of dollars each).  

But I need them - I have 7-8 herniated or bulging discs and live my life in sheer agony. The ONLY time I feel even ok are the two hours after I take 3 of my 30 mg instant release oxys. I get no euphoria from the pills or any other positive effect other than pain relief. And that's all I'm looking for here. 

I find myself having come up short on both prescriptions by about a week because of my own stupidity and irresponsibility. If it's being stupid to try to actually fix my f**king pain. My doctor won't prescribe any higher dosage and won't give me any pills early. 

So I'm trying to figure out how to get through the next week without just dying from the pain (and withdrawal). I have some 25 mcg fentanyl patches and might be able to get some 100s. How much, roughly, do you think I'd need to just barely get through a day? Like 150 mcg of fentanyl? More? 

And should I go buy some heroin off the street? I've never done it before, I don't know where to go or what to say to the dealer, or even how much I need. 

ANY help, please, anything at all, is MOST appreciated. I'm utterly desperate. I've put myself in an extremely dire situation, and now I need to know how to figure out how to get through these next 7 days without killing myself from the pain (I won't, really. But it's going to be absolute hell). 

So - how much fentanyl do I need, and should I eat the gel (which I prefer) or smoke it? The actual patch just doesn't work for me, I need a faster and bigger release. 

And should I bother trying to get the fentanyl when I could just go somewhere in my town and buy some heroin? I have money, I can buy what I need, but I'm extremely afraid of getting caught and being put in jail without the drugs I need! Thinking about staying overnight or whatever with nothing - that's truly, truly hell. 

If you've read all this, god bless you. If you have any advice on ANY of these questions, god bless you again!!! I'm desperate for any solution here, please let me know what you think!!",1516692429.0

What do I say to my soon to be former running partner?,"I'm not quite there yet. I'm getting my photo ID registered this week right after pay day and going in person to register for insurance. I figure by the time I get my ID in the mail, the insurance will be active and I'll be able to get a real prescription for Suboxone.




I still plan to procure dope one last time this week. I'm owed half a bun from Cliff and it ain't coming my way until Friday script day becasue he had to spend all of his money to pay his elecrtic bill after the power got turned off this morning. Which I believe, because it happens a few times a year. I'm planning to buy dope one last time this week, some of it will get loaned to Cliff until script day.


From there I can either count the script as part of my last hurrah or I can trade it with someone else. TBH, I'll inevitably consume the roxies. By that time I'll still have one and a half (12mg total) subs on hand to ensure I don't get sick when I run out. This will also to ensure that I don't feel compelled to buy more dope for lack of subs.

&nbsp;


I'll attempt to get more subs on the street but this pay check is part of the grander plan.


**Phase 1:** Pay fee and register for photo ID at DMV on Friday. Then go to health insurer in person (yeah they have a spot) and try to register for that while waiting for ID to come in the mail.



**Phase 2:** If the insurance is active before I get my photo ID, I'll schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a prescription for subs.


**Phase 3:** Use my new photo ID to pick up my Suboxone script from a real pharmacy.


If my insurance isn't active by my next pay day over two weeks from now, then I'll just spend cold hard cash on the doctor and on the Suboxone script. I'll get a manufacturers coupon to help. By then I'll have my photo ID which is the only major obstacle to gettng subs legally aside from the cost.


Basically, this week should be the last time I buy subs on the street.

&nbsp;


**Now to the question:**

If I ghost on Cliff, he'll eventually begin to persistently try to get in touch with me. He might start with phone calls and texts to my mobile but it won't end there if I don't respond for a couple of days. Early on he'll call my house phone but then he'll ultimately come knocking. 


**When I'm ready to kick because I have a script for subs, I need to tell Cliff something to prevent him from knocking on my front door.**


**What should I say?**

&nbsp;

I ask because I forsee some possible issues. If I say, ""I started seeing a doctor and was prescribed subs."" He'll want me to share some. A couple of months ago when I said I was planning to see a doctor because I Was tired of all the bullshit (spending all of my money on pay day, getting sick because his promises lapsed) he asked me in a worried tone, well practically asserted in a worried tone, ""you are going to share some of those subs when you get them, right?"" 


So you see, if I say that I have a script, he's gonna expect a piece of the action. If the insurance covers the entire cost, I wold still pretend that they cost me a fortune so that I can't be accused of being grimey by not sharing. 

&nbsp;

Perhaps once I have the script locked down I can just honestly tell him, ""I'm out of the game for good and can't share my script because the doctor tests my urine for bupe levels."" I currently cannot predict the outcome of this strategy but I don't think it'll be good if I tell him that I have a script for 30 8mg subs for the month. He knows I never take a full 8mg in any given day. He'll probably say ""I've always shared my roxy srcipt"" but the two free roxies I've recieved every month are payment for me biking to the pharmacy to pick them up. I earned that. Everything else costs me something. 


Maybe I woldn't mind sharing a few subs but I really don't want to set a precedent.

&nbsp;

Been on buprenorphine for the past year, very slowly decreasing my dose. Gone from 4mg to 2mg.

Essentially the side effects are getting to me. Ass shredding constipation, drowsiness, that awful numbness with none of the enjoyment of my past use. Just kinda sick of being addicted tbh. But it was always going to be a long term thing, jumping off completely would pbb be a bad idea, especially at such a relatively high dose. I'm hoping that dropping from 2 to 1mg will help with the annoying effects, give me some sense of control and renew my desire to get off of the stuff, even if I go back to slowly reducing but from 1mg rather than 2.

How long do you think it will take my body to adjust to a new lower dose? I'm guessing weeks rather than days... Could anyone who has done this in my situation tell me how bad it might be? Or am I worrying too much about something that'll be mostly painless?

I'm not too worried about any relapse, I'm confident that I'm over it, for now at least. Maybe I'm being overconfident but I feel sick of opiates in general given my recent feelings about my buprenorphine habit.

I had 2, 8mg subs, 10 1mg lorazepam and half or so of a xanax bar along with a couple OZs of potent Kratom.

I made it until today, I have 2mg left of the sub, 5 1mg Ativan and most the Kratom still. 

I called my dealer to see if he had another sub and he said no but then gave me the deal of a lifetime on a G of ECP (tested, no fent).

My question is if I do this dope (it’s been 18 hours since I ate a 2mg piece of sub) then wait til I WD a little to take the next piece of sub... what kind/how bad will my WD symptoms be when the last piece of sub wears off? Will I be able to manage them with Kratom and benzos? Also have Lomotil, seroquel, and a bunch of weed",1516649180.0

So me and my SO do blues occasionally. Actually, we occasionally take breaks from blues. I make good money, so she doesn't have to work. She worked when we first met, and my life was worse than it is now, and it allowed me to get a somewhat grip on things. I buy my blues from IRL sources. My SO and her brother really like weed, i stopped smoking years ago. Since the darknet offers a better selection and price to the weed thats around, i tend to get it from there for her and her brother, along with other drugs that people request from time to time. I will sometimes get samples of opiates that i havent had or havent had in a long time. A few weeks ago i got some BTH and smoked it. It was okay. Then i got .2 of some ECP the other day. Normally i can bang two blues at once and it gets me level (add another two and im probably nodding), but this .2 had me level all day. I couldn't get too high, as we were supposed to be on a break from using blues. A day or two later i order a gram. It comes from only a state away. Im sitting here waiting for the postman to come to deliver my package. I last used suboxone last night, so im going on over 12 hours from last dosage, as of right now. I tell people i know about this stuff, and they are amazed. I should be making a killing with this stuff. If you are lucky, you can get good $90/g stuff here, but you can almost guarantee without a doubt, that it wont be $90 next time, or it will cut to shit next time, if not both. The current rate is about $160/g - if you can get it. And half the time its mixed with fent. I can get this insanely good stuff for $160/g or less (if i buy more).

Not sure where i was going with this. I guess im just killing time before the postman comes. Im hoping he comes while my SO is out (like now), because last time he put it in a stuffed duck, and my SO was wondering why i got shipped a stuffed duck (that had a obv cut down its back), luckily it got the product out before my SO investigated.",1516641583.0

I can't be the only one","To make a long story short, I started suffering chronic migraines around the spring of 2016. I saw a neurologist who threw a bunch of pills at me over the summer. I didn't get much relief, so out of frustration I turned to pills. In the winter of 2016, I discovered kratom. By the summer of '17, I was taking at least 60 grams of it per day.

Due to various circumstances I could no longer afford it, so I stopped cold turkey. That's when I was hit with the worst headache of my life, far worse than any migraine I ever had. The worst part was, it never went away. I could go on and on about the soul-crushing, all-consuming pain, about how I didn't eat or sleep or days, but the short version is, I was hospitalized for trying to end my life.

Fast forward a bit and I managed to survive long enough to be placed on 12 mg/day of suboxone. It was great for about two weeks, then wouldn't you know, another transcendently painful, multi-day headache. I survived by taking multiple strips and being placed on a seizure medication that took the edge off.

This process repeated about once every two weeks or so, till I finally decided to hell with all opiates, and quit suboxone cold turkey.

I've been off subs for almost three months. I've had a chronic headache this whole time. My neuro knows about it and has thrown a few pills at me but nothing has worked out. I think he's desensitized to me honestly. It's different from a migraine, it's a very blunt pain that often encompasses my whole head with no nausea.

Am I the only one in the universe with a chronic headache like this? Is there anything else I can do. I can't imagine living the rest of my life in this much pain. I was hoping that as my tolerance went down and my brain healed the pain would get better, but there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. Would agmatine help at all? I still do have some tolerance, as I sampled some kratom last week and it took 9 grams to feel anything.",1516639829.0

I was scared to overdose, but also I didn't want to underdose. Can you druggies tell me how do I know when I've taken enough heroin for an optimal experience? 

For example, if I feel nauseous after 1h, or if my stomach is a bit ""tense"", is it a red flag that I should not smoke more until a few hours?

No, no, no,  ***note to junky; dboy has more than one customer***  They don't wait around all day just for your call. This also applies to the junky trying to score behind someone's back.

My habit is out of control. It's not as bad as some of you all, but the amount of money I've spent, the unholy things I've done to obtain my drugs... It's sickening.

I was full-on junkie behavior today. Laid around all morning til I got the call then jumped up looking like a ratchet unshowered wreck and ran out the door lying my ass off, pulling money from several places including sketch store returns, couldn't even make it home to use and found myself staring at myself in the disgusting bathroom mirror hating every second of it all. Actually I went to 2 different gas station bathrooms because I couldn't get all the pills to dissolve in the syringe at the first one (boofing) so I had a shit-covered syringe ""that I needed for my kids medicine"" in my pocket for a bit. 

The pinnacle was sitting in the parking lot with my $70 in hand, wearing a shirt for a company I used to work for waiting for my drugs and thinking how shitty that would make my mugshot (think prestigious job.... In the medical field.... working with addicts smh). They shorted me and they've ripped me off before and I went back because I'm fucking stupid and I was in withdrawal.

To wait all day to do my shitty drugs that was half of what I paid for, and I'm already almost out 4 hours later... Man its just depressing. I hate carrying this weight around. It's like I put on a backpack full of bricks every day and it makes every part of my life more difficult than it has to be. It hurts, and I somehow convince myself that I HAVE to do it. I NEED these little pills to keep going. 

Anyway this one time really pissed me off because I've got something really REALLY good about to happen in my life in less than a fucking week--I've been waiting for this for over 3 years.., and if anything had gone wrong all of that would have been ruined. My life would have done a 180 right down the shitter. A nose dive.

My pcp prescribed me norco for the pain and it helped ALOT. I would run out early cause sometimes I needed more than one. 

I moved States and unfortunately this state has a big narcotics issue and I’m young so they think I’m a drug seeker all the time. I suppose I am in a way but it’s really not for fun. In May I went to the ER with my head pain causing vision problems and leaving me screaming in agony. They did a spinal tap and sent me home saying I was a drug seeker and they don’t want to help me. 

That same night I woke up after knocking out with the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life, kidney stones, broken bones, cysts, labor etc NOTHING could touch this pain holy shit I could cry just thinking about it. Turns out they let out too much spinal fluid. I spent the next 10 Days in the hospital getting dilaudid and norco every couple of hours. Once I could finally go to the bathroom on my own without crying I got sent home with NO medication. Total bullshit. 

So anyways. That head pain came and went every other week or so I’d have an attack. October I got kidney stones. I went to the ER every couple of days to get pain relief and they’d only send me home with a couple days worth so that’s why I kept going back until I finally saw a specialist who said I shouldn’t be in as much pain as I’m claiming like wtf?? Are YOU the one feeling it?! 

This led me to asking my mom for some of her pain meds or buying some of my friends script. Since end of November though the head pain has started to worsen. It was now weekly almost every other day. I finally got a new pcp last month. 

She gave me Tylenol 4 not exactly what I wanted but honestly I was grateful for it anyways. I called her and let her know I ran out about 4 Days early. I told her up front I’d be honest with her but since the head pain was now daily as of 3 weeks ago I had no choice. She said she would not refill until after I get some testing done. Here’s the thing. Making appointments out here for literally anything takes fucking weeks. It took 5 weeks just to see a urologist. 

I want to add as well that I have told her I try EVERYTHING before I reach for a pain pill. I always go for excedrin/ibuprofen first, a hot shower beating onto my head, massage, I’ve even put icy hot onto my scalp looking for relief. This head pain is ruining my life. 

I don’t know how to make her see that I’m desperate but not really an active drug seeker I just need relief so I can live my life. I love my life it’s excellent and seems to only be getting better but this pain (and occasional kidney/flank pain) are debilitating. They’re ruining my life. I’ve been passed over for pain management but they’re still trying to get me an appointment which I appreciate. 

Someone please tell me what to say to make her understand that if I don’t get help in reliving this pain I might just end it. It sounds super fucking dramatic but it’s the damn truth it hurts so bad. I even tried calling my dr in my old state to see if she could help me but I got nothing. I’m at a complete loss. The appointment is tomorrow I don’t want to go in crying and begging for help but I NEED her to understand that until the mri/blood work and all that stuff comes back with what’s causing this and then they can figure out a treatment plan then I’m all for that! But right this very second I’m sorry I need pain pills. 

I’m very close to losing an AMAZING job I have because I’ve missed so much work for illness. I don’t smoke or drink or take anything illegal (other than buying scripts from friends which is technically illegal I know) 

Any advice please just give me a good way to word it to her that I am desperate but without coming off like “I’m addicted and I wanna take all of these pills at once” I’m at my wits end. ",1516776101.0

I ruined my ex-girlfriend's life. I am a 18 year old girl just finishing up high school. Lately I've been feeling very responsible for the downward-spiral I've thrown my ex into. Her and I started hanging out a year and a half ago. I'd basically live at her house on the weekends and we'd have parties. We both had never touched a drug before in our lives and I wanted to try something. She hesitantly agree to do something with me. I ended up stealing a whole bottle of oxy from my parents and we tried it that weekend. We both fell in love with it and soon after we fell in love with eachother too. We developed a habit and soon enough the bottle was empty, so we moved on to something else. When that would go dry, we'd keep moving until there was nothing else to do. School became a blur, withdrawals were worse for her because of the depression. She ended up in an impatient facility where she met someone new. Someone with better drugs, she was never in love with me. She left the impatient a week later and left me in the dark. I submerged myself in anything that would give me a chance to forget. A month went by without me noticing, she called me from the hospital. She was crying, telling me she missed me, saying she had overdosed the night before. I went crawling back to her but she continued to see the girl she was dating at the time. When I saw her again, she had completely changed. Her eyes were cold, her voice was harsh. She was pale and held a constant dark presence. I had lost her completely. Now a year and a half later, I haven't heard from or seen her since. She hasn't asked about me. She had so many dreams and I feel like I ruined her. I did ruin her. 

I miss her warmth. ",1516771532.0

I've never used a needle in my life, but I have a long history with opiates - coming up on eight years since my car accident (therefore pain meds). Tramadol, Nucynta, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, tea, fent. 

I was clean from heroin for a while recently, using suboxone. I relapsed right around new years and have used pretty much daily since. My new location has beans instead of glassine baggies like I was used to in NY. 

Anyway, today my boyfriend and our friend went down to the city to get our shit. All was well but he got a little too high. Id been taking care of him, but then decided Id do a bean and a half. 

So i go downstairs to take care of him, remember nothing after. I collapsed onto the floor and wasnt breathing. My bf gace me mouth to mourh while waiting for the paramedics (no cops came). They hit me with 2 shots of narcan. I came to and saw the paramedics and his dad over me and i began screamung for my bf - who they said was impaired and woukdnt let him near me in the house. 

He made up a story that i still take tramadol and told them it was a mini seizure and the reason the narcan brought me back is tramadol being and opiate.

I left AMA. I never thought i would fucking OD. I snort my shit. I do a tiny amlunt wjth each new pickup to test it. I fucked up by being pissy at his level so i decided to do more tk get there myself. Im also presxribed gabapentin and xanax. so was on that too.

Following 4 weeks of medically supervised detox stabilization, there was no advantage in prolonging suboxone use (7 days vs 28 days taper). The 7 day taper participants had a greater rate of opioid free urine specimens than those who had a 28 day taper. This was a sample of over 500 randomly assigned participants so quite representative.^1,2

Initial suboxone doses ranged from 2-8 mg on the first day in another study. Doses were mainly stable for up to 24 months averaging 10-24 mg per day (notice higher than induction). 75% of patients continued medication assisted therapy, tapered off it, or started methadone maintenance or inpatient therapy. 21% tapered from suboxone though no follow-up on their success with abstinence was conducted.^3


Abstinence may be maintained with a brief and intensive suboxone taper, followed by use of naltrexone. While the study had small samples, abstinence was greater in a 4 week versus 2 or 1 week taper condition (after stabilization). While 63% of individuals were abstinent after 4 weeks of tapering, 29% of individuals were also abstinent after 2 and 1 week tapers (non-trivial). While these results contradict the previous study, results were no different at 1 and 3 month follow ups (aka the same number of people were clean or not clean). There were other differences in treatment conditions as well.^4

In youths age 16-24 a 56 day taper was superior to a 28 taper in producing opioid negative urinalysis. ^5

Patients had a better likelihood of transitioning off opiates when in a 30 day rather than 5 day suboxone treatment program.^6


In summary, we don't really know much about ""long term"" (beyond 30 days) suboxone treatment but we do know that anywhere between 7-30 days can be effective in reducing opioid use. Several studies use counseling in conjunction with suboxone. 

To me it seems with the right support, there is no reason to be on suboxone for months or years at a time - though 'with the right support' is saying a lot. I'd love to hear people's thoughts about long and short term suboxone treatment.

And how bad of an idea is it to visit him or send him money?","*This is a throw away account for obvious reasons*

Ugh, I gotta pour one out for the homie big time... My dealer is in jail. Long story short he was headed over to my house to do a trade, some norco 10s and some xanax for some fire black, not that it really matters, but he never showed up and never got back to me... for days. He never took days to get back to me. 

Well, I mentioned it to another client of his that I had just met and become friends with. Ironically, he's in jail too right now, for the dumbest reason possible; failing a SCHEDULED piss test. He'll be in for another month but that's doable. Anyways, she looked up his first and last online and, well, he got caught.

Now, I know what he had on him for the most part. A scale of course, a ton of needles, baggies (most likely at least 50), at least one prebagged measurements of black but most likely more, and anywhere from 3 to 14 grams of black on him. I bet he had some suboxone and either some Xanax, kpins, or both. I think this is his first major offense. I know he's been to jail for minor things before but I don't remember if he had gotten caught up for heroin before.

Anyways, my dealer was a great, great guy. He delivered usually with no charge, he was almost always on time (dealer time, but still, if he said 15 minutes it always meant no less than 45) and over time we started to hang out. Hell, I would loan him money sometimes and he always got me back with interest. He helped me find junkie chicks and all around was a great guy. 

I miss him already and I know hes sicker than a dog right now in that cold, lonely jail cell :'(

TL;DR how much time do you think getting pulled over in a car with a scale, baggies, possibly several prebagged doses of dope, some kpins and 3-12 grams of dope will being if its his first offense? ",1516755815.0

When I got out in November I only used Kratom and lope for my cravings until I gave in and relapsed two or three times using opana for only 2 or 3 days each time a couple months ago I'm currently on community control (probation)  other than that I've only been using Kratom to satisfy my cravings and keep myself from tearing my hair out due to cravings and not being able to get anything done due to anxiety and general dysphoria. While I was in jail suboxone was pretty prevalent there and I remember taking an 1/8th or less of an 8mg strip and snorting it, and getting incredible euphoria. My cravings were non existent during those times. I only used suboxone 3 times while in jail. 

I just got on suboxone last week and decided to keep snorting it and i'm taking under my prescribed dosage which is 4mg twice daily instead I'm taking 2mg a day because I've read less is more. I'm just not getting that magic I got when taking it in jail. Could the kratom have affected my tolerance? I'm curious how to make it better for me so I can get some euphoria or a small buzz when I dose.

I had been on day 2 of opiate WD and was feeling like complete rats titties and I hit up the very few people I've met in this city since I have moved here.

Unfortunately, the strongest opiate I could find was fucking hydro 10s and they wanted $6 a piece for them... No thanks. Especially because they wouldn't even alleviate any of my WD symptoms.

About 9-10 o'clock that evening, I get a text from a friend that says he thinks he can score some H. Well I head over and get to his place. He tells me that the dude he thinks he can score from doesn't have an active phone, but does just show up randomly at times.

30 minutes pass and low and behold, he shows up! Fuck yeah! I throw dude 40 to get me a half of some tar and promise to break him off some... I'm generous and an all around nice guy. Well he has to drive 1 hour away to get it... FUCK. 

Me and my friend end up just chillin and watching TV, while I'm holding in my bowels and trying not to explode like a volcano. Time seems to be standing still as I can hear my wrist watch tick....tick.....tick. Well he finally knocks on the door after a lengthy 2 1/2 hour trip.

""I have some bad news, guys"" he says. My stomach drops even lower and gets even tighter than it has been for the past two days. ""I got ripped off. The guy sold me molasses"". At this point I am FUMING and KNEW I should have gone with this guy to pick up the fucking dope. I am trying not to explode physically and emotionally at this point as I say ""it's all good dude. It happens to the best of us"" with as much sarcasm as I can inflict upon that sentence.

He splits after my friend gives him a quick chat. Now I am just sitting on the couch, incredibly pissed off beyond belief that I let my fucking money walk. I had so much faith in the situation that I made a rookie mistake.

My friend and I then decide to chill in his bedroom. I go to the bathroom to release my bowels for what seems like the 30th time that day. When I get finished and walk back into the room, I see my friend with two syringes, filled with clear liquid, and he has the biggest shit eating grin on his face.

""Yo dude, you wanna do a shot?"" I look at him like he just grew a head out of the side of his neck. ""what the fuck is in there dude?"" I say in an intereste manner as the only thing I've ever seen mix up clear is coke (which I knew he didn't do), Fentanyl, and ice.

""It's Ice dude. You wanna try some?"" he says, still with that huge fucking smile. Now I LOVE opiates and would choose them over ANY drug if it were available, but they weren't and I wasn't about to say no and not do some and look like a bitch! (great reasoning, right?)

He tosses over the needle and I tie off. He tells me to he careful as it's a quarter gram shot. He also tells me to push the plunger down slow because it can burn and to make sure it's registered because missing with meth can cause some nasty infections.

I hit first try, push down the plunger, take off the tourniquet, and before I can even pull the empty rig out of my arm, this fucking WAVE of heat comes over my body. I first feel it in my ears, then my taint, and then in my chest. Oh God the fucking feeling I got in my chest. It was like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson round housed me right in the sternum and knocked the wind out of me. Then came the dilated pupils. I swear everything got brighter and more vivid and could feel my pupils dilate.

""So, how do you feel Dickstomp?!"" he says excitedly. ""Dude, I never expected it to be like this. I think I may have found a new favorite"" I say, still not believing that I would have EVER switched from a downer to a stimulant. Not to mention, this was my first time ever doing meth and I IVed what most people smoke throughout the day.

The night carries on with me talking my jaw off, constantly pissing, going back to talking and conspiring, and before I know it, it's morning time. I didn't even feel sick anymore and since I had done that shot, I didn't even THINK of being dope sick. Here I am, 3 days into opiate wd and I feel fantastic.

The following weeks are filled with binging, jacking off for hours on end, binging more, bouts of drug induced psychosis, and a whole new addiction in hand....but hey! I quit opiates which is good, right?..... RIGHT?!


Honestly, I feel like meth is an easier drug addiction to handle. I currently use ice practically every day now, but only shoot about a point or maybe two if its a normal day and when I binge, I do tend to shoot about .4-.5 if I'm feeling froggy. Also since using meth, I have not touched an opiate the whole time. I also have had multiple stints of sobriety, with my longest being 7 days.

The only negative side effects from the meth for me are of course loss of appetite, dehydration (I try to drink as much water as possible), seeing and hearing things that sometimes aren't there (shadow people and some noises that startle me), and the worst one is probably just the ""on edge"" feeling I have but I have generalized anxiety so that feeling of impending doom is always there.

Fortunately with the aid of my psych meds, if things get a little TOO smacked, twacked, and gacked, I can pop my meds and be knocked out within 30 minutes so sleep deprivation is never a problem unless I forcefully keep myself awake.

If you read this, bless you because I tend to ramble and my story telling abilities are sub-par, even when I'm sober like I currently am.

I still frequent this sub as the stim and meth subreddit tend to get a little...colorful at times. Hope my opiate family is doing well and everyone has been safe!

Remember to practice harm reduction, do test shots of new shit, and say your prayers to JJ if you are sick!

Much love, family.

The drug scene is ever so prevalent as has been as long as I can remember. I remember hearing my teachers in elementary discuss with coworkers about our town being a meth town and a heroin town. Show up to school and there's orange cones in the building taking up most of the hallway that has it's walls covered in sea animal paintings to put copper wire back in, because of those ""fuckin tweakers"". 

Alright, so then I knew. Drug addicts do things that have a very clear impact on the world outside of the drug scene and they blatantly don't give a singular fuck. Okay cool deal I can handle that, at least they're not hurting other people right? At least not as often as they're stripping copper? 

And even if they were going to hurt someone else, say someone else even in the drug scene, they'd do it nice and quick so they can go back out to the garden at 4 in the morning and cut slugs in half with scissors, right?

I'm beginning to see I'm very wrong. Very recently my homegirl was kidnapped. She was MIA for almost 4 days before I got to her. I had the location of the biggest city in the county over (big ass city, to my standard anyway) and 3 unrecognizable names to work with. She was on foot, phone broken, and in captivity. I played investigator for 2 straight days and got like 90% of the order of events down to the very hour, shortly after I went to the city and found her myself. I called the county police twice and they basically told me knock knock jokes over phone. This is the second time I've rescued her from a serious, legitimate, low odds of survival kidnapping in the last year. Both times she was beaten and bloodied. I got her home safe the night before last, yesterday she was arrested and sent to jail. So naturally I've been runnin around at night pulling moves with her older brother lately, who as I learned last night has also been kidnapped in the last 12 months, also near death experience. 

The people who kidnapped him live in a trap about 3 miles from where I stay, been in the house a handful of times. I semi-often pull moves with a kid who lives there, who also, as it turns out, has been beaten and kidnapped and gotten away as well. Last night I put all of this in front of me and just started hitting people up to see what kinda answers I would get. 

It's 10. You guys 10 different people that I actively see in my life have been kidnapped, almost killed and gotten away. The farthest back was 7 years ago. There are more people I'm going to try. I also know of some cases where the victim did not make it out alive, though these are few and far between. So my question is...

What in the rimjob loving fuck is going on here? Did I miss a town meeting or something? Did I not get that memo? Is that email in my spam folder? Because what the fuck. So now I'm asking you guys too. Is kidnapping a common thing in the drug scene you belong to?",1516731913.0

**H a different beast**

---

I tried heroin out of curiosity, just smoking it on foil, never tried a needle, 2.5g bag of brown H.

It feels amazing, it is cheap at first, you think you can control it. But the truth is, you will pay back for the pleasure it gives you, and pay back much more than you received.  

Once or twice a week became weekend speedball binges, which became daily binges or at least H when I ran out of the white stuff. One day, I binged too hard and slept for ~ 16 hours and woke up withdrawing.  

WD is hell. I'm a grown ass man and I was crying, no sobbing, in my smelly, sweat covered bed for 3 days (thank god I used for a short time, no longer than a month at a time), trying to find anything to get rid of this feeling.  

Thankfully, I realized I was going through WDs, and chose to stop taking H, even though I had a bit left, to detox myself to avoid leading to full-blown addiction.

---

Even after suffering through the ordeal, I thought I can handle this like I could handle all the other drugs I tried. I bought another 2.5g and tried to chip responsibly.  

**Boy was I wrong...**  

Little did I know, I was addicted to it already. I suffered through withdrawals after using another month, a couple days a week at first to daily use, to the point where I would smoke a bit of H, smoke a cigarette and immediately puke my guts out.  

 Thankfully, my second detox was just before Christmas when I had to go back home to an area where you really cant find drugs.  

After the second WD, that's when I realized that every time I try it, even just once, I would go into daily use within a week.  

---

**You may destroy your life like countless others.  
You may learn what it is like to WD, have depression and the point of view of a drug addict.  
All of this because of 5 grams of brown powder.**

---

Am I glad I tried it and got out in time with a rough spanking?  

To be honest, yes, I learned that 'junkies' are just people trapped by chemical dependency, not bad people.  

I learned that chemical pleasure is why we live this life, but also that naturally produced chemicals by means of exercise or living life to its fullest are so much more sustainable for long, happy, healthy life than the temporary pleasures that drugs provide.  

---

Anyone thinking of trying Heroin, know this. 

**You WILL love it, you WILL experience WD, it WILL be shitty, and you just MIGHT destroy your life in a matter of weeks**

It is only lucky circumstance that saved me from its clutches.  
It is nothing like any other drug I've tried.  

**Do not, under any circumstances underestimate it, because as soon as you do, she will make you her willing slave. Warm on the inside, but as cold as a rotting corpse on the outside.**

I know that Gabapentin can help big time with WD, especially RLS (my least favorite part of WD). 

My question is, do you think I can take 2 each night when the RLS starts getting bad and that'll help enough to allow me to sleep? I used the search bar and found that most people recommend taking 900mg, but if I only take 600mg then I'll have enough to take these for four days. Do you think this will work or at least help, or should I just go for 900mg for a couple nights and then 600mg the last night? 

I don't want to waste it by not taking enough, but I also don't want to waste it by taking more than is necessary, especially if taking it sparingly will get me one more night of decent sleep.

Any help is appreciated! Thanks, and happy nods y'all!",1516865855.0

Knowing that I had this stuff set aside provided me with an ever-present safety net of reassurance and security. No matter what the situation, unable to find more, afford more, main stash gets found and/or I get busted, etc, I would not have to worry about being empty handed for a long time. And that reassurance alone was like being wrapped in a secure, fuzzy blanket. 

But the more I looked at that baggie of dope the more I saw it as a leash. In fact, I think I had the whole safety net concept backwards: the net wasn't for me, it was for the drug. If I ever ran out and couldn't get more, that back up baggie was the net, the leash, that kept me close. 

If I didn't have it, I may be forced to withdraw and be clean. I would have to exist in the reality that living without dope is not only possible, but perhaps I may even like it enough to continue not using.

But having a back up stash means that I could/would keep using. As long as the dope kept me on its rope, the idea of being without it would only exist as a nightmare. Being CLEAN or SOBER, would seem terrifying. But as long as I had more junk, I would never have to worry about those words.

TL:DR: Read it though.

So now here I am... I ended up trading my stash back to my dealer so now all I have left is a little bit of monkey water. Knowing that I dont have anything to fall back on is frightening. I feel more and more nervous as I imagine the very real and now unavoidable moment that approaches. The moment when I squeeze the monkey water bottle and nothing comes out. What happens then?

And that last thought triggers the same question to echo in my head, ""Am I really ready to do this?""",1516860318.0

I think I have a very emotionally vivid reaction to sticking a needle in a vein, and I'm trying to figure out why.  

As near as I can tell, I think it's the associations.  Our society avenges acts of violence by strapping the perpetrator down, sticking a needle in their vein and pumping in chemicals to smother the electrical activities of life out of them, a pharmaceutical pillow over the face of a hardened criminal who really deserves it.  

We could use more violence, like a beheading or a shooting, but of course, we do things the civilized way.  We're not animals after all.

And speaking of, we also do the same thing to our pets ""out of love"", right?  It's got to be for their own good, just like taking away their reproductive abilities in their earlier years.  Or a terminally ill person to ""end their suffering""?  We couldn't possibly relieve their end-of-life pain in any other way. 

'Cause if it looks like a medical procedure, with a guy in scrubs involved, we must be helping them, right?  Because doctors have never been known to act unethically.  After all, they give you shots and you've known that shots are good for you, ever since you were a baby.  They hurt, but that's how you know they're good for you.

And that must be why I can't stop shooting this orange crap into my veins.  The initial pain is almost an essential part of the experience.  Subconsciously, on a visceral level, it feels so therapeutic!  Yet I can't help but think about these other things also.

I am going to a nice recovery house in maryland because really having a plan to go to a recovery house is the only reason im still at my parents. 

So, I plan on going to see the doc at the clinic next thursday and starting detox the following monday. I will be going from 75 to 0 in 15 days, so 5mgs a day. I have been on MAT since july 31st of this year, i have also been narcanned while on 60 and it hurt like a mother fucker so i have a small preview of the pain i guess.

The things i have in my arsenal for me are, (unfortunately no weed cuz of drug court) 36 mgs of etizolam and im sure my mom will be nice enough to order more if im in enough pain, #51 600mg gabapentin pills, plus ibuprofen and all that OTC bullshit. I got some immodium sitting here and can grab another bottle if needed. 

I got plenty of time to kill to cuz im unemployed. The only thing that sucks is i still gotta go to a group once a week, individual once a week, and meetings 5 times a week for drug court, and i gotta go to the clinic and piss once a week all while drawing and watching everyone else dose still. ugh. But i got netflix, HBO go, reddit, and music.

Ill be honest with you guys, im definetly relying alot on etizolam to help me with this. Hope it works. So i plan on doing the 2 week taper to 0, then 2 weeks of hell at my parents house, and then to get into this recovery house i have to do 21-28 days in a inpatient place so after the initial 2 week taper, 2 weeks at the house drawing, ill have another month till i have to go to this house and start looking for a job and going to meetings everyday and all that shit so at least i got 2 months till i really have to be a part of the real world.

So after almost 2 years of binging H (iv) and every opiate I could put my hands on, I got clean. I am on naltrexone oral tablets (50mg) daily for about 3 months now. I refused the vivitrol shot so I have to deal with crushed pills that I must drink in a solution every morning. 
Beeing a good junkhead, after 1 month being clean I started preparing to get high one more time. So I waited. After 2 months I managed to avoid the naltrexone for two days (actually 60h) and went for it. And NOTHING. Maybe a slight buzz from the H but zero euphoria. I know the risks and I don't want to do abnormal amounts to get through the nalt, because the chances of getting it right are almost nonexistent. The next morning (~72h+) I wanted to try again. Just as I was leaving to get the dope, I got surprised and had to drink the solution earlier. Got really pissed. In the desperate attempt not to throw away the pervious 2 days, I runned in the toilet and threw up till I saw blood an felt there is nothing more left. It took me about 5 minutes after drinking the solution. So, because I really want to feel the warmth, I figured if anything was left from the pill it would take maybe 20 minutes till the naltrexone kicks in. Random bs. Maybe it would've been better to wait if the dose left was tiny. Fuck it.. Got in the car and took the dope. Took me 15 min. And...NOTHING. And those were some fat bags. 
Now, I heard bupe (subutex) has a higher affinity to bind then the naltrexone. Took 2 mg of bupe sublingualy at first. Nothing. The next day I took 8mg and felt a calming effect and uplift in mood. Next day took 8 mg again subli. Felt some warmth and relaxation finally (not like the one you get from H but...). It's ok at best if you compare it with the real shit but hey at least something works against this fucking blocker. I don't want to go 16mg at once. And I don't iv subs and bupe. I am sure you can OD even on bupe so be careful.

When i get home I can easily lower my suboxone dose and get fully clean or I can go straight from the airport to the varrios and pick up some black tar milk from gods teets and get high as fuark.

My brain keeps saying ""just 1 time"" but i know where that leads. Im so conflicted. I want to get high so bad. But i dont want to be a dope fiend again. My body is physically getting excited at the anticipation of going home and scoring. 

Even the process of scoring is enticing. Pulling up my hooks contact on my phone. Pressing dial. Hearing it ring. Hearing his beautiful mexican accent pick up the phone. Hearing him say come thru. Driving to the spot all excited n shit. The moment i see his car pull up. Following him knowing im seconds away from scoring. Seeing him open his car window. Telling him what i want. Swapping cash for drugs. The joy of it being in my hand. Unwrapping it. Ahhhhhh.

I’m old to the drug but new to the needle. I know I have done exactly 10 shots because the needle exchange place gave me 10 exactly, all of which have gone into the crook of both elbows. A few misses here and there has made me have to pull the rig out and try again. But, even with just that many pokings my arms are starting to look a little noticeable. It’s not HUGE but I’d like to go for a fresh place with my next bag just to give my arms a break to let em heal up a bit rather than just making them any worse. Plus you guys have told me rotating sites is definitely a good idea for harm reduction. Where is the next best place in your opinion? Does any factors like someone noticing play a role? Like - I shoot between my toes that way no one notices but if that didn’t matter i would definitely just use my hands or something...
It’s a fucking stinking hot summer here in Australia right now and I’d prefer not to have to wear long sleeve shirts ya know? 
One last little query. I know needles are once only use kinda thing. And never to be shared under any circumstances. But, if i’m in a pinch - say I can’t get a fresh needle, is there much danger using the rig I used just yesterday, one more time? What are the risks (if any) in doing so?

So it kinda freaked me out cuz I was already in a feeble state of mind and it was like 4:30 am. I also thought like, what if the illuminati started keeping an eye on me after this. But anyway fast forward to tonight and I go pick up from my dboy, guess what the stamps were.... Bingo, illuminati! So on my way home from picking up I pull over at the pride gas station near my house to pick up some Airheads Xtremes, and there's this guy in there who I sort of knew and acquainted with over the years and I shit you not he starts talking about the pope and the illuminati and the flat Earth and EVERYTHING like he didn't even miss a beat. It's almost like the illuminati is following me now, especially now that I made a Reddit post about it. If I randomly disappear forever let it be known that I got snatched up by rich people and used as a human sacrifice (okay I wouldn't be that mad honestly please sacrifice my body illuminati you have my permission).

And I seem to mistake reddit for my diary bc I'm pathetically alone with this shit, which I apologize sincerely for. 



As indicated, I used to do escort to support my habit. Now I only meet with two guys from that time whom I learned to like a lot. Just had a date with one of them and he's just he sweetest. He likes feet, he likes to cuddle, he okay with only handjobs, eats pussy like he has one himself and is a wonderful, insightful and intelligent person to talk to. I can't believe I'm getting paid to spend time with him. Granted, he's old and no Adonis, but that's why he's buying my time.

He doesn't know I use, but I think he might have seen my fresh track marks and I think he didn't really buy the 'I fell and cut my arm on a nail' story (it looks like a huge cut from some distance since I've been sticking the needle in hundreds of times along the vein). But he didn't say anything. And he said he can't wait to see me again. But I got major weird vibes I can't really put my finger on. Like, he didn't look at me when my arm was in the picture. 

Anyways, seeing him today was really a relief. Just having someone give me attention felt so fucking good. Tho it makes the pathetic emptiness of my private life really stand out. I finally ran out of coke and dope without buying new shit and intend to stay on my maintenance from now on. Been maxing out my credit card anyways with the last re up of my stash. 

Yesterday I had an important oral exam in uni. Didn't sleep the night before and was so speedballed out of my mind that I not only was shaking like a leaf in the wind, I made the most stupid mistake of mentioning stuff I couldn't elaborate on. It's still a good grade and won't affect my final grade negatively but I was so pissed off with myself that it really was the wake up call I needed. Hope it sticks. Today I overslept until 11am since I speedballed the last night away. luckily I actually do have migraine, so I could send a quick email without anyone getting suspicious at work.

I pushed the limit really hard, but with the money from tonight I can pay my tuition fee in time and since I'm exhausted from the coke hangover I'll be able to sleep tight and be at work in time tomorrow. I'm so relieved I didn't oversleep the exam or ruined my life by other means through this binge. Had the realization that I don't want to die anymore so there's no reason to wreck my life. Wanted to share this moment with you since there's no one else to share it with. And because I've been crying on this sub about how I can't stop binging on speedballs.

Got 12 replies (!!!) the names and details of said replies became a blur when they’d all try and blow up my messages. I couldn’t keep up. Here are the highlights (haha):

- one guy seemed legit and was all for meeting me and selling me some dope... but he thought I meant weed and disappeared shortly after telling me he doesn’t believe in heroin. (It exists whether you believe in it or not)

- one guy told me he could get me some fire dope but I’d have to go to one of two strip clubs to get it. 

- about 3 guys asked if I just needed to earn some money for my habit. 

- a 43 year old man told me I’d have to earn dope from him and asked if I wanted to “party and get freaky naughty”

- a 27 year old legitimately asked “a/s/l?” Followed by “I’m really just looking for a fwb right now.”

- started talking to someone in recovery who sounds cool but for obvious reasons can’t help me out. 

And honorable mention (I’ll use that term lightly here) goes to the fact that I found out one of my old school friends is in whisper posting vaguely covered selfies of herself talking about how she’s trying to break up her ex boyfriend and his current girlfriend because she wants him back and how she’s already completed step one of her plan: alienating him from his friends.

I just have posted about Stella a lot on this sub, and everything was always so sad and bleak. and it is still sad. it will always be sad to have lost her, it will always feel dark and lonely and wrong in the deepest parts of my soul. 

What I have learned in the last six months is that it absolutely is lonely and dark to have lost her, wrong and sickening and sad. But life is not lonely and dark- life is just life, and I can seek light if I choose.

I choose to seek light in the arms of my dear friend Faith, long estranged but brought back to me in the wake of our all encompassing tragedy. I choose to seek light in loose change showing up in places that it should not, because though I have no explanation I know that it is her.

I choose to seek light in trying to help others from ever seeing the kind of darkness that I have (the kind of darkness that Stella saw)

I know subs won’t work for me, tried that in the past. I’ll be back to pawning everything within a few months. 

Naltrexone pills on the other hand I know I won’t feel anything for about 72 hours.  I’ve thought about getting high on day 26 of Vivitrol, take Naltrexone the next day (If I only do .1-.2 of dope I’ll be fine after 24 hours) and then on to my next shot.  

Idk if this sounds crazy but it’s all I’ve been able to think about the last 3 days. I needed to vent to someone who understands.

Like I remember a couple weeks back I was visiting my folks and my mom, an elderly lady, was very enthusiastic about a new job interview which involved her making a video interview of herself. She really tried and put a lot of effort but was turned down quite rudely because of her age, she wasn't all that upset but this concept of my moms enthusiasm just dying is making me weep. Also today my dad sends me a photo of a lot of old baggies and wraps I left there when I was 18 (10 years ago), and asked me nicely how my sobriety was doing. Of course I lied and said yeah I'm still 10 months completely clean. Also my baby sister left to another province for uni, and I didn't even say goodbye. In fact I ignored her phone calls the past few weeks.. I have a child on the way and this transformation isn't only about me anymore, so it has to be done.

My dboy missed call me 2hrs ago and every fucking fiber of my being is saying go pick up and give up. Less than 24 hours.

Sorry for any typos or grammar errors in advanced since im texting from my cell because i just sold my laptop so i could cop some dope. I live near a major city with an open air drug trade. Since most if not all of the ""dope"" sold there is fent right now ive developed a fentanyl addiction. 

I know it is because my brother and I use together and he recently had a drug test at a rehab facility before he left and his test only showed positive for fent and carfent.

Ive tried both subs and methadone in my life. I went on subs 5 or 6 years ago when my addiction was only pills. It helped but i relapsed. I was going to a methadone clinic about a year ago but stopped because i was still using on top of my 90mg a day dose and i got a serious side effect of hot flashes and sweating which was killing me. Id dose in the am. Go to work and break out in horrid sweats. It made me so embarrassed. Id get home and just use fent and feel better.

The reason i see no way out currently is because as of today i have no money. My next paycheck is the friday before the super bowl. I have no insurance and make too much money to get medicaid or whatever. My paychecks come and I have work that day so instead of using it to buy insurance or whatever i have to buy drugs.

I dont think suboxone would help a fent addiction. Ive heard and read that suboxone just doesnt make a fent addict feel well. I could try a methadone taper idk.

I guess even more importantly is honestly i enjoy using. Ive used opiates for over 10 years. The longest i went without was about 20 days before my ex gf left me because of it. Everything in my life is ruined so I just live with my parents watch tv and browse the internet while high. 

I guess the only positive is somehow over the course of my addiction ive stayed away from the needle. I only snort. Well anyway. Not sure why Im even posting this. If anyone has any advice on how to take fmla in my situation or if theyve overcome a fent addiction lmk Ty.

My boyfriend of 3 years found heroin in my bag and he’s a drug user himself and has tried heroin once but made me promise to never do it again

That didn’t work out and I started using everyday, sometimes at his house I’d sneak in the bathroom and do some. I was so ashamed of my addiction and how I was lying to him and I also didnt want him trying more and going down this road. Mostly I was just ashamed that I couldnt stop using. I felt like a failure and a disgrace and now I even feel more so. Multiple times he asked me if I was on something because I was itchy and I said “It’s just Kratom”. Once he even told me “If youre using heroin you can tell me I wont be mad, I just care” and I said no. Because Im a fucking moron. And didnt want him finding out and getting pissed and making me throw everything out

Well he looked in my bag today and found heroin. He claims it “fell out of my bag” but I fucking dubt that because it was hidden well in a penic sharpener. I tried telling him it was for my friend and he was yelling calling me a liar and an untrustworthy junkie. He was so angry and said he cant even look at me and just left

Should I just continue with my lie or confess? I feel like if I confess he’ll leave me because I’ve lied so many times over this.

Fuck heroin I’m such a fucking mess. I had to take a day off work and how Im going to get some needles and stuff, I dont IV but I sure as fuck will if he breaks up with me, heroin will already destroy a 3 year relationship with the only man I loved, cant get any worse than this. :( What can i say to make him stay?

And yes I know Im a complete lying idiot, this is the only thing Ive lied to him about but its a big thing. Fuck me.

I would love to write that entire post over again, I won’t be posting on reddit when I am extremely emotionally distressed anymore lol.

It’s not me being naive and overreacting like a teenager, even though I can totally see how cringey that whole post was, I am in treatment for a mental disorder with symptoms of an extreme fear of abandonment and very extreme fluctuating emotions. My initial reaction was to write this sob story paragraph on reddit. I’m pretty embarassed at the entire post I’m probably gonna delete it soon as I got all the answers I wanted, lol.

I meet up with my friends, R and C. We snort a few and get a nice buzz going. I tell them if they want to get really high they need to boof it (halfway joking). I didn’t expect these guys to actually try and do this with two other guys. 

Anyways, None of us have ever used that ROI and they both got some lotion and proceed to stick a whole pill in their butt holes lol. I don’t know why I think it’s so funny looking back on it. Even though it wasn’t done right do you think they still got an effect from it?",1516968759.0

Firstly hopefully the location is stickied soon by mods to get the warning out. This is probably the first time I've been able to say me and my buddy were lucky to NOT get good money doing our ""games"" to get dope $. Our area a bundle is 13 stamps. We have about the same tolerance, and he often does all 13 in one shot if we made ok cash that day. Luckily, today again, we didn't so he only did 6 and luckily, I was there. 

He shot up in the car and after about 10 seconds I'm driving us out of the neighborhood and ask him if I'm taking him to his moms or uncles. No answer. I figured he just got tired of me asking. I have a brain injury and often repeat myself. I finally look over and see him all but drooling. Hat fell off, eyes closed, not sure if hes breathing but doesn't look like it, and his hand is on his neck almost like he went to check his pulse before going out.

I thought he was fucking with me. This stamps been around a while and this guy is not new to us and the quality is always good but never, like NEVER changes. (Someone obviously fucked up today). It's been so consistent we've been dumb and haven't even been smart and doing test shots. Luckily he only did 6 stamps instead of the whole 13 like he commonly does or I have no doubt he'd be dead atm.

I punched him in the leg HARD like enough to bruise each punch 4-5 times...nothing. Finally I pinched him hard enough to break skin and he woke up with no idea what happened and was angry I pinched him. This process happened another 4 or so times within 1-2 minutes before he finally came out of it. He remembers nothing besides getting pinched.

I was so afraid my friend was going to die right in front of me. Luckily he's good enough to load and shoot and register while im driving him. If he was home alone I don't know if he'd have woken up. Also, if he hadn't done the shot, I would have gone home and probably done 6 to save the other half until morning. Basically, we'd both probably be dead right now if he hadn't done that shot in the car.

I've lost many friends to ODs but never had something that close happen while I was there. He's on the sub but wanted to not be mentioned(username, first name, whatever) but John Doe, glad you made it and probably saved my life in the process too.

Please be safe everyone and don't be like us idiots where we went ""eh who needs a test shot? this shit never changes"". It only takes one fucked heavy fent batch.

If you see the sticky and live in our area, try to avoid it. You know how small our stamps are, .1 test shot of this could kill you. A single bag even with a high tolerance and you'd know because you'd swear you just did 8.

Dope in northern DE, Edgewood/New Castle area. Please read if you're a local.","This is a personal first hand experience so no BS. DE doesn't get mentioned a whole lot but if you're a local and read the title I'm guessing you know exactly probably to the or even the neighborhood I mean.

I've never posted one of these so I hope I'm following the rules but I want people to be safe so hopefully I can be specific as possible without breaking any rules.

Typical blue bags and it is stamped in black ""Ice Cream"". It's pretty commonly known in the area almost never changes so I'm afraid people will skip test shots and OD. Anyone not on reddit...well I wouldn't be surprised if there's a death already. Hopefully some fellow Delawarians read this and help get the word out on the street because it's pretty urgent as yesterday this same stamp was normal. Someone seriously fucked up this batch and my friend almost died over it.

Luckily my friend is ok. He has a high tolerance and if has the money will do a full bundle(13 bags here) shot and is perfectly fine. I'm similar but don't have the money to burn but I even will do 7/8 commonly without a test shot. JJ was with us and luckily he only did 6. I did not notice until I wasn't getting any answers on where I was dropping him. He was slack jaw wide open, eyes shut, hat fallen off, the works. I thought he was playing with me until I punched him about 7 times on the leg hard enough to bruise and it took an extremely hard(enough to break skin) on his face to wake him. This process repeated 4-5 times over 2 minutes and he remembers nothing.

Please be careful. This stuff is probably 10 times more potent than normal and I know these people make several stamps in that area so don't even do a .1 test shot, DE bags are small, so seriously a test of 1 stamp or .03 roughly is smart and try if at all possible not to use alone.

I feel quite ashamed because I took an opiate, but I think this will actually help bring me down a bit, it's A LOT better than hitting up the dboy for a couple wraps right ? 

I'm kinda ashamed of myself, but day 3 is usually the worst IME so if I use a once off codeine dose (extremely weak for me) to help get another day free from horse it is actually a good thing right ? 

I feel guilty Reddit, but also much much better.

... Some ketamine (pink rig) and a filter shot (blue rig). I'm not a huge fan of iv ketamine, but snorted doesn't do it for me and I really need to fall asleep asap and relax (it's 3am where I'm at).  




My mind is racing with cravings and I have almost convinced myself to go and buy some coke and dope after work, before having another date. I mean, the date money has to pay my rent, tuition and insurance. Of course, I'll scrape by if I spend a 50 on some dope tomorrow. But today was just day one after the binge. What tells me that it'll be only once tomorrow. 




Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck... I hate that I need to argue with myself and that it always comes to admitting that my brain is hijacked, but that I don't care bc I want or *need* to get high. Yeah, okay, I used to be very acutely suicidal, but I can use this only so long as an excuse for needing drugs to function. Because I am *not* functional on Cocaine! There is no valid reason to continue using speedballs. I'm forgetting little things, like, which compartment to put in the laundry detergent or noticing that I have already took out the toast whilst trying to get the toaster to release it... I took it out like half a minute before. I don't want to dissolve my brain. It's the only thing giving me a chance on a semblance of a normal life despite all the trauma and fuck ups. 




But when I go and get dope, I won't be able to orgasm and that's shitty. Coke let's me do that at least. And if I wait until after the date my dboys business hours will be over. It's just a cluster fuck. There is so much else I should be thinking of and attending to right now.

My questions are, how much potency have they lost, if any, being stored in a pill bottle in a cool dry medicine cabinet?

Also, how many do you guys think it would take and how often to alliviate withdrawal symptoms from a .3-.4g/day (when we can afford to get high) bth habit?

this past Friday, i ran out of my gabapentins about 2 weeks early. i had ran out before, but don't remember having trouble sleeping. i also had 86% indica oil, but that's another story. so i guess i was well equipped, unlike this time. I didn't feel anything until sunday night into Monday, when i could NOT sleep. then came the anxiety and racing thoughts, then the restlessness, then the stomach pain, oh god the pain. worse than opiate withdrawal imo. i think maybe because gaba is absorbed in the gut? that's my take, but i also have a bad stomach.  but anyway, as time went on, it seemed to be getting worse. it got to the point that i was hitting myself in the head to try to sleep, so after 2 sleepless nights, i gave in and drove to the VA emergency and told them i ran out of gaba and cant sleep, within 2 hours of getting there i had my week early refill and my dosage upped.

Then a few months later after a forced apology for calling her a drug addict, I let my guard down in August and she gobbled up all my Flexeril.

3 weeks ago she asked for a muscle relaxer and I gave it to her, she immediately drank 6 beers and continued all night.

I’m seeing my doc tomorrow and thinking about asking him for a Narcan Rx to help me stop bingeing.

Does anyone have experience with a patch? It’s supposed to be more effective than the spray because your med level is constant.

I’ve seen a lot of ads for combination bupe/narcan patches, guess I’m not even sure if there’s a Naloxone-only patch on the market yet.

I am a long time lurker and opiate head - 23 years since my first time H dragged me in.

I want to share a harm reduction hint for snorters, mainly Hydromorph Contin or Palladon as it's called in many European countries. The same obviously applies to any other fine powder but I found it especially important with Hydromorph since those beads - when properly crushed with a mortar - really turn into such a fine powder like flour, which makes it especially bad on the lungs. 
As hopefully most of you know, insufflating fine powders can lead to silicosis (dust lung) and is really dangerous. This can happen when the powder you are snorting ends up partially in your lungs instead of the nose which is obviously more likely with fine powders.
Silicosis is not something that happens overnight but rather overtime which makes it even more dangerous.
Street drugs like Heroin, Speed or Cocaine are often (or in case of good C always) not enough powderous to pose big of a risk, but obviously depending on quality and cutting agents used can also pose a problem.

We came up with this when snorting Hydromorph since as stated above, ground Hydromorph Contin/Palladon beads ideally yields a VERY fine powder which is virtually impossible to not end up partially in your respiratory tract.
We first tried to ""close"" the route to our lungs by trying to exhale or have your mouth full of water when snorting but neither really lead to satisfying results.

We then figured that we need to get the powder less ""flourish"" by moistening and drying it - while at the same time still grinding the beads all the way fine - since only that will lead to maximal effect and bioavailability.
So we would mix a few ml water (or even better saline solution which we make ourselves by mixing few grains of salt with distilled water)  with the powder - just enough to yield a paste which dries quicker. Results were good but it took a while to dry (30-60 mins. depending on amount of water etc), and interestingly enough the powder never turns back to as fine a powder as before moistening it, even when completely dry.

We then improved it by using much less water, it suffices when you lay out the powder flat on a clean surface and spray it slightly with some water/saline solution.
After spraying we mix the powder pile with a card to make sure all of the powder is equally moist - this approach will yield a snortable powder immediately (i.e. no need to wait for drying).

Since we discovered this we enjoy our snorted Hydromorph much more since we don't have to worry about silicosis anymore - before without moistening you could feel how every line would dust up your lungs which takes away the fun of it...

Try it - you'll be surprised how easy it is and your health will thank you in the long run.
