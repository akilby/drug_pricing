Did a shot in the bathroom and fell out to cops coming in. They ransack my shit and I didn't think I had anything on me and paraphernalia isn't a charge here (needles etc). 

They go through my bag an flip it inside out and find **an old supply I forgot about** in my old cig container that has those ""plastic caps"" crack comes in but the place I copped then were just selling dope in those containers strange enough.. 

I tell them I got beat and it's bunk, nothing in it except maybe baking soda because it really is bullshit dope and wasn't doing ANYTHING for me. 

When they found it, they said it looks like I have *ready rock* so they already presume it's crack. I was hopefully thinking it doesn't come up for anything and instead I get charged with Crack/Cocaine possession after being in the holding cell and waiting to get processed.. What the fuck? 

They're saying they tested it and it came back positive for that but I KNOW that's bullshit.. that wasn't crack or Coke. It's suppose to be dope first of all and it barely was that. Do they just assume and put that charge for now and test it later in the DA's office or they're saying it's tested back forncrack because I know it's not. I think they're only saying that because it was in that container which cracks normally sold in so they just assumed and slapped that charge. Idk should I get an attorney and fight it? Maybe AMP Program but I've been arrested for heroin possession before (5 months ago) 

**New info**: I went down to the station and they told me they tested it and it came back positive for cocaine. I find this hard to believe because no one is cutting heroin with cocaine and if it had a HINT of Coke, I would've tasted/felt something while shooting. I feel like i was setup honestly and don't know where to go from here... 

the only reason i would assume they're saying it's crack/cocaine is because it came in the capsules they're normally sold in but i feel like they're corrupt enough to plant it using old supplies and say it's what I had. It's really fucked up

* TLDR: fell out at school restroom using the dope I just grabbed and cops came in, found old crack containers containing what was suppose to be dope but wasn't (maybe a shitty analog but was all cut) and now getting charged with possession of crack/cocaine -saying it tested positive for that. I think I'm getting setup.

62ro0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/62ro0m/another_one_gone/,21,https://redd.it/62ro0m,Milkandspiders,Another one gone.,"Last night I lost a long time friend to an OD. He'd been clean for two months and was trying so hard to get his life back in order. We had a deal, whenever he was getting the itch he would call me and I'd talk him down. It was working pretty well. I woke up this morning to several calls, texts and voicemails. After failing to reach him I contacted his girlfriend and found out what had happened. 

I know it's not my fault, but I can't help feeling guilty. I'm sorry for rambling, this post doesn't really have a point. I just miss my friend. 

Edit: Thank you guys for the support and and kind words. It really means a lot. I just found out that his family is sending him out of state to be buried which infuriates me. For the last few years he'd been trying to get home hoping that without any connections there he'd be more likely to stay clean, (which we all know is unlikely) but none of his relatives would help him out. Now the people who stood by him and supported him are being robbed of the closure a funeral or memorial service would provide. So I'm trying to get a memorial put together. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. He was 27 years old. 

Edit 2: Thanks again for the condolences, guys. I really appreciate it, and it reminds me why I love this sub. I'm planning to have a small memorial service next weekend and, if anyone is interested, I'll let you guys know how it goes.

The word (slang) is for the act of pulling blood into syringe and push it back to the vein with any 'leftover heroin taste' in the syringe after pushing all heroin into vein, it's so you wouldn't waste any heroin that stayed back in the syringe.

Please let me know if you got the word, thanks

_p.s. 
If you want to know if there's still heroin sitting in the syringe after all of your ritual and getting high, then just taste water/blood that was left in the syringe. It will be very bitter, indicating there's still bit of heroin stuck._",1491036910.0

I remember feeling the little square pocket above my main pocket that almost allcmens jeans have and where I keep my dope sometimes. And having 1 bag in there I remember debating for what seemed like forever before deciding ofcourse to do it. 

I went to the bathroom and busted down the bag and did my line ...ya I didcmy line! I remember getting back in the car feeling happy and good and I remember nodding tocsleepcthat night waiting for them to get me for the test which they never did. 

The dream goes on after this and I woke up happy I wasn't in prison IRL so I completely had forgotten that I was able to take my drugs in my dream until I was just thinking about the dream it self (ya I hate prison that much and it was that vivid of a dream in still thinking of it 2 days later) that I missed that completely.

And thank you to anyone who chooses to read the whole thing. ]


I mean, this was hell. He stole from me, lied ab just ab everything, hid his H from me, until I found out (which didn't take long at all...) & then that's when it just imploded. He was completely dependent to the point the withdrawals led to drinking which led to detox which led to suboxone therapy which things actually for a slight small moment started to get better, and then I found out he lost his job..... An amazing one I might add. He's so smart, has a Masters degree!! He's not some lowlife guy who never graduated HS (and I'm not bashing the people who haven't btw, so please no focusing on that.) - (And I know he's already going to use ""for fun at times"" again, but has told me it'll be under control this time........and because I'd be the one administering / control it..) -_- Anyway.  (Oh and he's also a recovering alcoholic, which is what tipped the edge over (this time) into detox). 

Not many know how it feels to literally watch your significant other, who you love more than ANYTHING, have done just about everything you could possibly do for them, deteriorate in front of your eyes and there's nothing you can do about it. Absolutely nothing. They chose this drug over you MULTIPLE times. It feels like all the time - because it basically is. I just can't even begin to describe how that makes someone feel. 

Now - I'll let you in on something. I'm a drug user myself - in fact, I love them! The only difference between me and my SO is I have the ability to stop or only use as needed / wanted and be fine & he doesn't. So the fucked up thing, is he does all these horrible things to me and puts me through hell for months, steals from me, lies to me - oh mannnn did he lie to me - I stick around because I love him and know who he's who I'm supposed to be with (I'm 28 and he's 35), so we're not some young kids. And I'm devastated watching this. But on the other end of me wanting him to be clean, I want to keep recreationally using. But that's not fair, is it?

I shouldn't have any right to get mad when he talks about using or want to use when I'm supposed to be his support system of staying clean.....when I want to use. BUT I DO! And the fucked up this is, right now, when times have been tougher than EVER before - and I need to be there for him and supportive and obviously sober - I want to just get constantly 'gone'.  I don't wanna deal with anything. I want to escape. (Quick side note - I can't take opioids because I'm allergic and get violently ill that I never could even get close to getting any type of ""high""'off of them - so more my style of using is weed, Benzo's, mdma, 5-APB, etc. but on the other end, MDMA or any drug relating any of those effects won't work on him bc he's on SSRI's - so we're on complete opposite ends of what we can take - which is why him using is a big deal to me bc it's only stuffy that will get him hooked again, he can't take the 'fun drugs' - but I can......) but back to the story. 

But how can I talk about wanting to escape and take all these drugs and still get mad at my bf when he says the same thing? I know it's fucked up. Idk. But right now he's jobless (trying to get a job yes, and has told me not to worry, typical bf stuff to say to the gf to calm her down so she doesn't freak out - which I may have a few times...), and all I want to do is use...& I should be staying strong for him. So fucked ...Anyways I just had to type that out. So if you read this, you're awesome. And any thoughts or comments are welcomed.

PS: I wish no one could get addicted to drugs and we could all just get fucked up randomly together and never have to worry about getting hooked. That would be awesome. Ok I'm done. 



Edit: the good job he lost was over 100k, so when I say he had it good / good things going for him...I wasn't kidding..

2nd Edit: I caught him about to shoot up, when he told me he'd never even think about doing that (only sticking to snorting) and then come to find out it's been multiple times before that. Oh. And still no job. I love this man but FUCK am I wearing thin...I'm almost getting to the point where I don't care...I'm not there yet, but I can tell I'm getting close. I'm tired of crying. I'm tired of wondering if he's lying. I'm tried of wondering why I let this keep going on. I'm just tired. Rant over.....maybe. ",1491012203.0

A person had copy-pasted a section of an article about kratom. Here's a section of the article, the interesting bit in **bold**

""A series of experiments was conducted to investigate the effect of mitragynine on anxiety behavior, cortisol level and expression of stress pathway related genes in **zebrafish undergoing morphine withdrawal phase. Adult zebrafish were subjected to two weeks chronic morphine exposure at 1.5 mg/L, followed by withdrawal for 24 hours prior to tests**. Using the novel tank diving tests, we first showed that morphine-withdrawn zebrafish display anxiety-related swimming behaviors such as decreased exploratory behavior and increased erratic movement. Morphine withdrawal also elevated whole-body cortisol levels, which confirms the phenotypic stress-like behaviors.

Exposing morphine-withdrawn fish to mitragynine however attenuates majority of the stress-related swimming behaviors and concomitantly lower whole-body cortisol level. It was also showed that mitragynine reduces the mRNA expression of corticotropin releasing factor receptors and prodynorphin in zebrafish brain during morphine withdrawal phase, revealing for the first time a possible link between mitragynine's ability to attenuate anxiety during opiate withdrawal with the stress-related corticotropin pathway.""

I've heard of rats, mice, monkeys, etc. used for this kind of research, but getting fish strung out? crazy.

I have suffered from legit medical (all abdominal) problems for years. Each ER visit and the pain was legit; several resulted in being admitted and operated on. Last surgery was last fall and I have unexplained pain that I never had before that. At times, it brings me to my knees. A couple of ER visits ago, asshole doctor basically accused me of Doctor shopping. No exam, no bloodwork, no CT given.

I have been back with one bout since then. I am being told that since I present as ""benign"" (that they can't determine cause of pain,) I'm SOL and they are not giving me a damn thing. 

Been referred to pain management (in couple of weeks) but I'm getting desperate here. There are times this pain puts me in my floor while I pray to just fucking die. 

What can I do in the meantime? Asshole doctors see me as a junkie (even with a history of many surgeries and issues) and just let me lay there and suffer. 

I can't take it anymore. I have never in my life so much as smoked a cig, but I can see why people turn to the streets to buy shit. Thing is, I'm a nearly middle aged white chick who doesn't know the first thing on how to do so.

So I went and bought some ket and some pretty good amphetamine. It was almost an impulse buy, and tonight i got a Nice offer. 

So, maybe some backgroud info on my experiences with opi - stim combinations is in order. I already tried some of the amph, maybe you can tell lol. Anyway, here we go; I've done speedballs many, many times before and it's one of my favorite things in The Word lol, but only combined H with amph probably 2 times. My memory of those two are a bit foggy due to benz. But i do remember feeling great. So I do have a bit of experience. 

My opi tolerance is pretty high. 0.25-0.3 of decent quality base H has me feeling alright and not anxiety ridden anymore. I think my stim tolerance is pretty small, If i even have one. I take 30mg ritalin xr everyday and have been since early january. Maybe one of you could fill me in  on stim tolerance/x-tolerance.

Now to the questions/request for advice part: 
First of all. Are there any important things that i absolutely need to know? If I do, please tell me! :) 

What should my dosages be, based on what my tolerances to both classes of drurgz? I want to have a nice, chill time. So i probably don't want to do a very large amount of the speed since 1) my stim tolerance is low to nonexistant and 2) I don't really know the purity/potency of the speed. 

So, what do you guy's think? I would really appreciate it If you don't comment things like i shouldnt do it and things similar to that, because I'm going to do it, and would like to feel /be safer with your help and advice :) 
Ofcourse; If there's a very valid reason for you to advice me against it, that's different, and I appreciate all of your's concerns!!

So I'm in the playroom with my kid getting ready to play battleship. Suddenly my kid decides she wants to dump an entire glass of water all over my cell phone. I panic because, you know cellphones and water don't really mix. 

So I snatch up my cell phone and proceed to rip off the case being that I can see the water underneath the plastic screen guard. Well I'm sure you can guess what happened next. All of the empty bags explode all over the room to my horror. Like so sort of sick confetti. My kid and my girlfriend's mom both see this happen. I drop to my knees and as quickly as possible gather all the empty bags. I'm sure this seemed rather strange being that my phone is completly soaked at the moment. 

I then head into the kitchen; finish drying my phone and confirm that it is still in working order, which it is, thank goodness for my waterproof Samsung S7. While I'm finishing up drying and putting my phone back in the case, my girlfriend's mom asks me. ""AlmostAJunkie, what were those little things that fell all over the floor?"" I'm like, ""Oh those were just candy wrappers. Yeah, I have this horrible habit of putting trash in my phone case at work rather than on my desk or on the floor."" Hopefully she bought it... Anyhow, I'm happy my phone still works after all this went down, and hopefully my girlfriend's mom is naive enough to really believe I stopped everything to pick up candy wrappers.",1490996650.0

We left for North Texas late Wednesday night, and got to Marfa, Texas Thursday evening. We camped at a cool hippie campsite that had restored airstream trailers, and huge TeePees you could rent and sleep in for the night. I took about a gram of tar and a ball of powder with me, and rationed it the best I could.  We did the last of both Thursday night so when we woke up Friday and we both took 2 mg of subs and a little bit of Kratom before hitting the road. 

We left Marfa early Friday morning, and headed straight to El Paso. We got there around 1 PM, parked our car in the parking garage, and then walked across the Santa Fe bridge into Juarez. 

As soon as we got into El Paso, there is a really bad sandstorm with near 40 mph winds. It was just as bad in Juarez and it made walking around absolutely miserable. Once we crossed the border, there were Farmacias everywhere.  I'm not exaggerating when I say every third or fourth store on every street in downtown was either a pharmacy or a dentist, and sometimes here, the two are not mutually exclusive. 

We went into somewhere rooms have a dozen Farmacias before finding one that had what we were looking for. I spoke to the pharmacist and just said ""alprazolam"". He motioned to a pretty young girl who also worked there to come over, and he wrote ""alprazolam"" on a slip of paper, and gave  it to her. She started walking out the door, and told us to follow her. She led us out of the pharmacy, around the corner, end up a flight of stairs that lead to a dimly lit room that was right above the pharmacy we just came from. 

Basically, this pharmacist just asked for our identification so he could write our names on the prescriptions. And then asked us how many and what dosage. 

We ended up walking out of there with 120 2mg Xanax bars and 120 100mg  phenobarbital. After paying the doctor for the prescription, and paying the pharmacy for the drugs, the total came out to less than $26 American. 
After that we pretty much explore the city, getting food and stopping in every other bar for whiskey and tequila. 
Later that afternoon, we decided to find a hotel and get settled in for the rest of the day. Not even 10 minutes after checking in, I find a connect for tar, and he's on the same block as our hotel. He has it on him at all times, pre-weighed out and bagged. 
A gram from this guy cost about $17 American, so between me and my friend, we went through about 3 g yesterday and I've gone through another gram this morning lol. 

That's it for now. Just waiting for my friend to wake up so we can check out of the hotel and walk back across the border to El Paso and start heading back east. I'll keep y'all posted. Love this group and love y'all!

Do we really get those when in the midst of a gnarly addiction? We tend to do dope when we are happy, when we are sad, when we have it, and we'll find it when we don't. It's not special. It's special to us, of course, but that's it. 

I turn 27 years old today (sunday), and my girl will be working, my friends didn't take the day off, and I'll be alone. I'll perform the exact same ritual I do every day: 0.5 if the highest quality tar (I can find/ in my town) in in the main vein, followed by hours of introspective contemplation as to what the fuck happened to me. My dealer won't hook up any ""birthday deals"", he doesn't care that 27 was the age my dad died and the age I've always suspected would perfectly round out my statistically cliched and ironic white (lower) middle-class junkie life. He's not going to wake up early, make me pancakes, and surprise me with 3 of my closest friends and a fist-full of acid with my name on it, for a day if smiles and acid magic. Tomorrow is going to be nothing special. I'll hustle, use, and prepare for the next day. 

Do any of you still do anything special for those events in your life? My girl and close friends don't use, so that's never been something shared (they know I'm an addict, and hopefully still think I'm clean- doubt it), so I'll still be performing my blood magic in the bathroom, alone; no confetti, no birthday shots, just the same shit as yesterday, alone. 

Ironically, im not sad, but I want to find a purpose again, and I want **to want** to celebrate and be happy I'm alive - but may God help them if my girl/friends don't end up working tomorrow for some early morning surprise birthday shit that fucks up my copping schedule... I'm all for celebrating them being in my life, but not for celebrating **MY life** as it is now , at least, not before I'm well enough to fake it. 

Tl;dr do y'all still make it a point to do anything else besides the daily hustle for your birthdays? Or do you slap a bow on that same bag of dope you dug through every other day and some how convince yourself it's special, only to nod our half way through singing happy birthday to yourself?

I then proceeded to tell him that I was going to shoot a half gram off the bat which scared the shit out of him and he begged me not to do it. Then, I sent him a non coherent text message and disappeared. He called me. He called our mutual friend. Our mutual friend was in on it and said she couldn't get in touch with me and that she called an ambulance to go to my house. She also told him she walked to my house to make sure everything was ok and to meet the ambulance there.

After about 15 minutes, I texted him saying ""April fools, bitch!"" I haven't heard from him since.

Ive talked about this topic two other times in different threads on here and people seemed to enjoy the story, so I figured I'd actually make a post about it. 

At the time I was snorting Opana G47s and from my experience these babies stopped me up WAY more than my now current IV Heroin usage. Not sure if anyone else has had the same results.

Im just gonna go ahead and copy/paste my most recent comment about this:
By the end of the 3rd week i couldn't stand or walk for more than a few seconds because of the bloating and discomfort. Also i couldn't pee without pushing hard no matter how much pee was in me, i think this was because my blocked bowels were pushing up against my bladder and like blocking the passage or something. Because of these two things it was almost impossible to even sleep. But on the morning it decided to come out finally, i was sitting on the toilet with my feet up on the wall so i was somewhat in a squatting position and like less than half of the first big poop was sticking out of me and no matter how hard i pushed or wiggled my body it wouldn't budge. So i sat there with a stretched asshole from a massive turd hanging out of me for about 20 minutes. I was crying and panicking trying to squeeze it back up in me or squeezing my asshole to ""cut"" it but with no luck for those 20 minutes. I really thought i was going to have to call an ambulance to come scoop me off the toilet and help me get the poop out. Really, who wants to make that call and be THAT person to ruin an EMTs day. That was my main reasoning for crying, sheer fear of future embarrassment. But finally after wiggling my body and pushing/squeezing (and also i think my butthole started to bleed which helped lube up the poop lol) it came out. It was huge. And then after that came normal size/small pebble sized hard as fuck poops that felt like razorblades coming out of my freshly torn lil poophole. After i got out what i could i felt more relieved than I've ever felt in my whole life and i wanted to go tell everyone but of course didnt. But man, after you give birth anally you feel so accomplished and proud. Closest ill ever feel to being a mother. Rip turd baby.

Ive had people tell me I should have reached up there and pull it out but I just was too afraid to go near my butthole with that monster sticking out of it. Plus i didnt have gloves. But if it got to like an hour of sitting there I probably would have. I cant remember correctly, but I am pretty sure I did try enemas but all that came out was water. I think the poop was just waaay too hard by that point. Which is pretty scary when an enema doesnt even help. I really dont know why I waited to do anything for that long. I was used to not going for a week/week and a half by then, and then when it got to the middle of week 2ish is when i think i tried the enema. I dont remember if i ever tried stool softners or anything like that.

But yeah, in conclusion, 10/10 would not recommend.

Here's my story:,"Well guys I finally grew a nutsack and decided to try and find a connect here in Morocco. The thing about Morocco is most of the shit is in the north. So after putting ""Looking for HEROIN in ____ city swipe left if you can't help"" on my tinder description which had a picture of just my lips (lol) I realized I've reached an all time desperate low at around 2 or 3 weeks sober.

Not to be vain but I have nice lips...nice enough to get like 50 matches (or maybe it's that phenomenon where all guys swipe right for every girl on tinder because they have trouble getting a match...who knows.) I spent 3 days talking to people sorting through these matches taking a huge risk, eventually I found someone. Someone that took my 100 dollars and never came back. The second person sent me to the other side of town and said ""It's a joke haha,"" and the third guy said to meet him and when I got there he had coke not heroin, wtf?

I also met a cop on there and I asked him in french ""are you gonna ruin my life?"" and he said ""No why would I do that."" Phew...

Ok fourth try..It was the third day around midnight and I call this guy. He seems like he would have absolutely no connection. He comes to my neighborhood with his buddy and from the get-go it's like I made two new best friends. They don't use but they went out of their way to find me someone out of the goodness of their hearts. They took me out for a night of fun and cocaine. They were intelligent, educated and funny Moroccans that had complete respect for me unlike the other 30 fucktards that said ""sex for drugs."" It seriously felt like unconditional love from complete strangers. They tried to tell me I don't need heroin that I should quit. They were fascinated with me. 

In the end they came through and I've got 5 grams being delivered in a week from the north. Delivered because it had to be ordered, weird huh? Well apparently the city I'm in H is extremely rare and people get it by ordering it. I would have NEVER guessed. The main guy said he would handle it completely and deliver it to me personally. They did not ask for one cent. I even told them I'm more into girls lately and that I had no clue about the LGBT community here and they said they know plenty of gay girls that they could introduce me too. *tears* No judgement. 

On a side note I understand that this is compromising my sobriety. However I would like to add that I am not a perfect human being and the concept of heroin being completely inaccessible was making me suicidal. Whether or not you can sympathize with my situation just understand that currently a good metaphor for my logic brain vs my addict brain right now would be a one man army vs. a nuclear empire. Also this shit was so fucking hard to get it will be completely impossible for me to use on the daily. 

Long story short: Just checking in opifam. I met two awesome, respectful, non-hypocritical, modern, feminist ( in the actions speak louder than words way) Moroccan guys randomly off the internet after being scammed 3 times. They went out of their way to make sure I had a great night, we talked for hours, and next saturday I will have 5 grams and they made that happen! I also had a fun night of blanche neige (snow white..what they call coke here lol)

Sorry if this sounds to methodical I am quite sped up rn. Getting Oc 20's. Wondering if i should pop/snort them or if i should pop half and rail half. What do?

Information:
Not next week, but the week after on Tuesday/Wednesday I am getting 4 OC 20's. It's been 6 months since i've used. My first two times trying oxy i popped a 20mg OC. It produced some euphoria but it wasnt amazing. I then tried popping a 10mg IR pill and I found out why it was so addicting. I've not tried extended release since. The few times after that I did use oxy I was popping 10mg by dissolving it in a drink. Weirdly drinking 10mg IR produced more euphoria than popping an OC 20. I have never snorted oxycodone before.

question:
Should I pop or snort these oxys? 
My thesis would be I'll try cutting the pill into 3 sections. A 10mg section and two fives. I'd then pop the 10 and at the same time snort a 5. Two hours later I will then snort the other 5mg. I just want to have the best and most cost effective high that I can. ",1491076290.0

Idk if you've seen the post I made a couple days ago about me panicking trying to find a connect or some form of opiates to keep me well after my dealer randomly left to detox without a warning at all. I heard it from his friends when I went to pick up the .5 they had left. Anyway I had been going through other people the past couple days but today I texted the old connects phone to see if I'd get a response. He told me he left detox and said I could come through. He actually didn't have me waiting for him to come out like most of the time (10-50 minutes) he came out rather quickly to do the exchange. Same great quality I expect from him. It made my day so amazing since the stuff I was buying recently was absolute trash it barely got me well.. Never high. 

With this stuff I had 1 small hit and felt a high. That's with a G a day tolerance. Sorry for the shit post but I feel the force of JJ and having something actually suprise me and be positive. 

Yeah I keep my tar in one of those silicone containers made for oil. It's decent to hold it in since the dope I get easily leaves residue on the trash bags or whatever packaging. So I transfer then save the residue on the bags to dry out for when I'm sick so I can try to feel ok then. 

Anyway, sorry again for the shitpost, I hope your day goes according to plan or even better. I hope you all are well or have connects and money not being a huge issue today. I wish you all well. I'm trying to enjoy my day with this, its kind of hard to be negative when your favorite drug is in hand and you owe no one.

Oh, if you guys don't know this you can reflint clippers with any flint from leftover bics or cheapo crack lighters. Just save the flint from any empty lighter you come across, buy a can of butane for $3-6 and you won't run out or need a new lighter for months... I grew up with bics but clippers are refillable and reflintable.. Just so much cheaper specially when you're trailing on foil as your main ROA. On top of dabbing and cigarettes. I go through 2-3 bics a week.. But have had this same clipper for a little over a week now. The longest I've had any lighter and it still being usable. It detatches the wheel and flint so it can be unscrewed and reflinted but you can use that to pack joints. I use that or the stylus from my phone. It will def save you money. I got this tye dye one for 1.69 but they sell them for 1.99 other spots.. Again. Wish you all a good day.",1491073634.0

I know one dude who will sell sub strips but he only sells a certain amount per month bc he needs his own (I don't blame him). So yesterday I bought THE last one that he would sell from his script.

Lately the sub has become inundated with memes, and deciding what to do with them has become a controversial issue. Half of the subreddit thinks that they ruin the quality of the sub, and the other half find them funny and enjoyable. The mods spent a lot of time discussing how to handle this issue: do we ban them outright? Do we allow only a certain number of memes per day? Do we only allow high-quality, original memes and if so, who is the judge of what makes a meme ""quality?"" 

We are aware that we are going to upset half the subreddit with any decision that we make, but I think that we've come up with a workable solution. 

From now on, Mondays on /r/opiates will be Memeday. This means that **no memes are allowed Tuesday through Sunday.** This rule will be strictly enforced (if you would like to post a meme on these days instead of waiting for Memeday, feel free to post on /r/drugmemes) and **memes will be removed, with a ban for anyone repeatedly posting them.** 

And since memes are usually low-effort and low-quality, and to make things a little more fun, we've decided that **only memes will be allowed on Memeday.** This means that any stories or questions that you have **must be posted in meme form.** This encourages creativity and also ensures that we'll always have Original Content on Memedays instead of the usual vapid, mass generated memes that are usually found on Facebook.

This way anyone who hates memes can just avoid the subreddit on Mondays (Memedays), but will be able to safely enjoy it for the rest of the week. 

[Here's a link to a meme generator page,](https://imgflip.com/memegenerator) to make things a little bit easier for the transition. I'm pretty excited to see what you guys come up with for your Memeday posts, and hopefully this settles the issue once and for all. 

**Memeday goes into effect this Monday.**

So finally...The whole point of post is I'd like to try tapering again. Have maybe 10 30s and about 5-6 OP 80s. My question is, how does the OP oxycotin dosage over time work? Tomorrow I'm going to just try taking 1 80mg OP when I wake up and if i can last the day, which I would be suprised by, then would biting or cutting off say 20-25% of it the next day lower the dose per hour or would that just eliminate some time off the back end if that makes sense? 

Back Story:
About 3 months ago, at request of my fiance and my own desires to try a clean life after 10+ years of Oxy usage. I quit using from a 250-300mg Oxy plus 40-60mg opana per day habit. Tapered down as best I could which wasn't much for about a week until I ran out. That's when hell kicked in, from Monday until Friday I don't think I did more than shower 2-3 times total and push buttons on the tv remote. Even using 15g Kratom + 2-3g of concentrate plus an additional 20-30 pills of Imodium , all that twice per day and still was horrible mentally, bad anxiety that made me feel like I let everyone in life down, that I was a leech to my fiance and unsupportive of my daughter, etc Just this feeling of impending doom but yet nothing you could really put your finger on, would be the best way for me to describe it. Had some valium from DNM but I don't know if it was real, didn't seem to help with anxiety anyway. Just no energy to even stand up let alone get anything done... Just bad. After 2 weeks I started feeling better but even after 6-7 weeks I never felt great, neither physically nor mentally. Tried vitamins, B + D, L-Tyrosine, multi for men....I worry that I might have fried some permanent pleasure center in my brain that no longer works. I had no passion for anything, didn't  even feel like watching anything  on tv, tried video games for about day or two. No matter what it felt as exciting as watching paint dry, literally! 

At this point, my fiance was nagging every day to get up and get something done, anything as she would say and I know she had every right to be after that long of sitting on my ass watching TV all day while she busted her ass at work to pay bills that I wasn't, so of course it started by me picking up 5-6 80mg OP. Thought my tolerance is going to be so low that it will last me months anyway! Ha was I wrong, I even did everything I could find d to potentiate, white grapefruit juice, that antacid that begins with a ""C""...Cimentine or something, tonic water, Alieve, and tums. Started with a small sliver, 30 min later, not a damn thing, about 1/4, Again barely anything, just keep eating pieces until I ate whole 80 and finally was good. Was able to demo kitchen and lay new tile floor over next 3 days but those 5-6 were gone now and to top it off. Waking up in mornings I could feel WD symptoms again, so I fell back in...Picking up 75 30mg blues that lasted about 2 weeks, maybe few days more. 

So finally...The whole point of post is I'd like to try tapering again. Have maybe 10 30s and about 5-6 OP 80s. My question is, how does the OP oxycotin dosage over time work? Tomorrow I'm going to just try taking 1 80mg OP when I wake up and if i can last the day, which I would be suprised by, then would biting or cutting off say 20-25% of it the next day lower the dose per hour or would that just eliminate some time off the back end if that makes sense?

So the plan was for me to pick this dude up and take him to a trap I know of that 3 fucking hours away (one way). After so many trips that have ended up w me gettin hella irritated w the person in the car w me or poeople just in general doing dumb shit that might get me in trouble just being in their presence (people throwing trash out my window, one kid left a rig in my car [seiously KK, WTF] people not wearin seatbelts and shit like that. That Could get me busted for me not even doing anything ) I kind of swore to myself to I would never make this drive w any one ever again. But I digress. The opportunity came up for me to shoot a speed ball or two today, all I had to do was drive the dude down to the trap and give him a number or two. I warn him ahead of time that I'm a pretty irritable guy (actually, I'm just an asshole) and give him some ground rules for my car and tell him about all the trips I've done that have gone wrong and...just please don't be annoyin or piss me off kinda thing bc it's a long drive.

We make it down there and I get him a G of dope and 4 dimes of hard w out a hitch.

I shoot a decent little speedball and kid I took down snorts a line of dope (he didn't have a horn on him). We started our 3 hr drve back. We stop a couple times bc dude has to puke. I'm pretty high. I'm actually pleasantly surprised because not only is the dude not annoying me or pissing me off, I actually kinda like the dude. He seems like just a nerdy white kid that's scared of cold copping or going to the hood and that's fine. If that's the reason someone gets me high on their shit I'm totally cool w it. 

Then disaster struck

My high from that first lil speedball is wearing off. We stop for him to puke. My spidey sense is tingling. This dude reminds me of someone else I know and I just thought I'd ask him ""you still have that dope right?"" *something* just reminded me of a friend like him that just manages to lose *everything all the time*. Kid checks his pockets *nothing*. Thinks I took his shit and tell me to run my pockets (lol if I stole your shit why would I remin you that's gone? I would kept my mouth shut and you wouldn't even know til you got home). It's nowhere in the car or in his or my pockets. We drove like a *fucking hour* back to the last place I let him out to puke and scour the parking lot. Still nothing. Go back to the place that he realized it was missin and check garbage cans and shit. Nothing  

I mean it wasn't my dope so I don't have *that much* reason to be pissed. It was just my get high on my favorite drug combo for free ticket. But I took like 10 hrs out of my day today to get this dude some shit and HE FUCKING LOST IT. like wtf. HOW DO YOU JUST MISPLACE YOUR DOPE???

He didn't even *realize* it was gone until I just happened to ask him ""you still have that right"" I don't know what made me ask him. My spidey sense I guess could just sense something was wrong and that the dope wasn't in the car w us anymore (ain't it weird how your body can pick up on shit like that?) He just *seemed* like one of those smart nerdy dudes that's good at a lot of shit but jus sucks at...certain things. LIKE KEEPING TRACK OF WHERE YOUR DOPE IS. 

Sorry if your reading this G. I'm not trying to be a dick. I was actually pleasantly surpirised w what a nice dude you are when I was driving down there w you. I'm just pissed because I very very badly wanted one more speedball outta that shit before I dropped you off.

In other news. You just made someone JJ moment of a life time.  Or some soccermom just threw some perfectly good dope and crack in the trash. 

Since I've started taking people down there to cop, I keep having to add more and more rules for my car because of other people's stupidity. Looks like I'm going to have to add yet another rule. Like, the dope goes in the trunk no matter what or somethin. We can take it out to use but when we get done we put it back until I drop you off. This is how we end up w stupid rules people. 

TLDR: was gonna get high today fro driving some dude to cop. Got a little high. Dude lost his drugs so couldn't get any higher. 


EDIT: BTW IF YOU ARW A JUNKIE/CRACKHEAD ANYWHERE BETWEEN ATL AND CHATTANOOGA THERES A G OF BOY AND 4 DIMES OF CRACK JUST FLOATIN IN THE WIND OUT THERE. KEEP YOUR EYES PEELED FOR A LITTLE CLEAR BAGGY. ITLL MAKE YOUR DAY IF YOU FIND IT BC THIS WAS SOME GOOD SHIT THIS FOOL WASTED.

Luckily it was a friend that just happened to roll by (guardian angel I guess) and brought me out of it so to speak. 

Now I'm not sure if I fully OD'd but this is the second time I've fallen out on it (first being yesterday morning). I don't even remember pushing the plunger down this second time though and I was outtt. I don't remember much leading up to the first time either but I do know I sat there for a minute before I went down. 

Obviously I didn't fully OD, did I only fall out? I did the same amount as always but with drastically different results. The dope looked pretty fucking legit too, wasn't just that straight white BS powder you'd guess. All I know is that it was scary as fuck waking up realizing I coulda been gone for good without even knowing it. 

Main reason I believe this to be fent vs strong dope is, well my tolerance to begin with. H doesn't even get me high, just well. This shit gave me 3 separate real good rushes in one day. I'm normally lucky to get a tiny one first thing in the morning.  Also lasts like about an hour.

 But this past Friday I took 1 gram of H split between 3 doses 6am, 2pm, and 9pm. Saturday morning 10:30 AM I took about .3 which was my last dose. I woke up Sunday at like 5 AM feeling like shit, I thought almost 20 hours has past and I had noticeable withdrawal symptoms, chills, nasuea/almost puking, restless legs and arms spazzing, skin crawling, so i took 2mg Sub and some ambien to try to get back to sleep. But I nod in and out its 6am and still no noticable changes so i took another 2m subs, 7 am no change in feeling so i took another 2mg. 

So I am not feeling better at all and now it's 9Am and the withdrawal symptoms are getting worst, at this point I was already feeling like shit so I couldn't tell if it was precipitated withdrawals or nto taking enough subs? At this point I had no clue what to do, the subs weren't helping but i didn't wan tto feel like shit, so by noon i was waiting around for my connect and copped another gram. I shot some and felt better (didn't feel a huge rush but a tiny bit). 

So now my question is, since there is suboxone in my system, do you think I'm able to just take suboxone when i wake up or do you think that will throw me in precipitated withdrawals again because I took more H?

Not even masturbation. Due to my constant consumption of opioids/opiates my penis remains in a perpetual state of dopedick.

I haven't tried to pursue any type of relationship or intimacy in years..
The closest I've come is sharing a mattress and ""snuggling"" with a female acquaintance whom I was too jammed to even fathom fucking. 
What's startling to me is not the fact that I haven't had sex. It's the fact that I don't even care, which prompted me to write about it.

The internet is now the only aspect of my life that doesn't involve dop-- never mind.

The scary part is I'm not even ""all the way"" downhill yet. I'm not some strung out fiend living at Father Bill's homeless shelter. My life is still somewhat stable and structured, despite that I've been using for just under a decade now (since late 2007).

I just never anticipated things to reach this point. I was a fairly social kid in highschool, had a decent circle of friends and maintained several healthy longterm relationships.
Now I don't converse with anybody aside from drug dealers, addicts, and people on reddit.

People in my family and those who know me think I suffer from crippling depression, but I don't, lol. I mean, when I'm sober, maybe: but that's more so a side effect of WD's.

I went and bought a 6 pound bag of Epsom salts at the drug store and mixed maybe a half cup of the Epsom salt with an equal volume of water in a little cup. This is magnesium oil -- in this case, it's magnesium sulphate in Epsom which is less effective but is cheap and readily available. There is another kind of magnesium oil using magnesium chloride but you can't get this for 6 bucks. It's absorbed more easily.

So, I took this amount of the liquid in a little cup, it's watery but a little oily, and I just pulled my jeans down and my shirt off and rubbed it all over dipping my fingers in. 

I have chronic knee pain too, and I swear that this shit just relaxed my muscles so much and took away the pain, and it really helped with the general withdrawal anxiety and restlessness so much. I'm positive it wasn't just a placebo effect.

I take magnesium orally, magnesium glycinate which is supposed to be one of the most absorbable, but my gut is fucked up from years of opiates and I apparently don't absorb it well because the transdermal magnesium was amazing.

I used like probably a cup and a half of it last night and this morning.

Then today I went and got dope but I didn't feel sick at all. I have also been on Librium for a week, just one pill per day. So that and the magnesium had me mellow. I almost didn't go. Magnesium is a calcium channel blocker like gabapentin, so I thought it might fuck the high up. But I definitely got higher than I would have if it wasn't for the magnesium. There was no other real variable, I've been taking the Librium for a while and I've gone off dope while on it before.

So, try it. A lot of us need magnesium and don't absorb it well, and this is cheap and easy.

You might leave a salty trail on your couch when it dries. Just try to leave any undissolved shit at the bottom and don't rub it on like I did with the first cup of it and that won't happen. And use really hot water so it dissolves almost all of it. (Or don't be a lazy junky slob and just heat it until it's dissolved in a pot or something.) 

Edit: And rubbing it on my muscles felt amazing too. It helps to rub it in. I just kept reapplying as it dried. If you don't actually rub the solid stuff on your skin you won't see much of the residue as it dries. I would just pull my clothes back on when it dried and then do that again in a little bit and used all the liquid up...Maybe it was only a cup total I used, idk, I was using a little dippin cup thingy, and now I'm high as shit and I didn't feel nearly as sick.",1491169273.0

I use opioids around once a month, sometimes more sometimes less. I've done Tramadol,Codeine,Tilidine,Oxycodone and Kratom and find the differences interesting and I would like to hear how they effect you guys. 

It would be really nice if someone can tell me from experience, how each drug listed makes you feel:

* Tramadol
* Oxycodone
* Tilidine
* Codeine
* Kratom
* Heroin
* Fentanyl

An example:

* Tramadol: Compared to the other opioids the euphoria feels different, probably because of the more serotonin like effect. Also it stimulates me more than the rest.

Thanks everyone and stay safe :)

(At home and conscious),"Has anyone done this?  Not when you go to the hospital and get put to sleep then they give you naltrexone,  but rather just taking some at home to do a rapid detox where the withdrawals are 50x worse, but only last 8 hours. 

I've done this twice. Once with heroin and once with kratom. With heroin, it was absolutely hell on earth but so worth it. I took a pill of naltrexone around 9pm, about an hour after my last shot of heroin. 15 minutes later it hit me like a ton of bricks. Puking and shutting uncontrollably, hot cold sweats, restless legs, hallucinations, etc etc. I had some really bad hallucinations and ended up talking to myself and puking basically everywhere in my apartment. By 3am, I managed to pass out in my own puke and wake up feeling exhausted and beat, but no withdrawal symptoms. For the following week I was super lethargic, but still not withdrawal symptoms. 

The second time I did this I was coming off 7 months of heavy daily kratom use. I took the pill around 5pm, expecting the worst. An hour in, I felt fine. I went to go lay down and that's when the restless legs hit. Some of the worst restless legs of my life, but that was literally the only symptom I felt. Passed out around 1am, and my skin felt really needly but other than that nothing. 

So as you can tell, I'm a big fan of this method. If you're coming off heroin, get a baby sitter for this method. I can't put into words how intense and terrible this withdrawal is, but it sure as hell beats a week of withdrawals. I always cave by day 4. With this method, you make it thru the worst 8 hours of your life and then you're golden. Then the worst starts trying to stay sober. ",1491154638.0

So this board is really the only opportunity I have to interact with other people with this particular interest.

I was curious what the other users on this board think about functional users, and how economic class can allow a user can ""compartmentalise"" their use from the other parts of their life. I'm currently at law school and I also do volunteer work advising clients pro bono on a particular area of law and occasionally representing them in court when they can't obtain other representation. I'm also on methadone and occasionally use on top as well.

I come from an upper-middle class family, I started using very young (age 15). I was going to a private school and I got hooked up with some very bad influences, and as a result I drifted away from my schooling and only graduated by the skin of my teeth. Once I finished school I committed myself to full-time drug use rather than go to university, but my folks supported me by getting me an apartment, taking me shopping when I needed food, buying me clothes and shoes and so forth. I had quite a few cycles of use, rehab, methadone, back to using. Eventually I managed to get a half-decent job in the City, and probably most of the time in my early 20s I was working and staying away from heroin.

A couple of years ago I got into law school (as in the country I live, you do law as an undergraduate degree unlike in America where I understand you go to law school after the undergraduate degree), and since then I've done pretty well since then in making connections with the legal profession, in getting some attention for my writing and getting published in journals. But at the same time, I haven't left using behind entirely.

My methadone prescription is provided free by the state, and a condition of that is that I have to occasionally see a counsellor who asks me irritating questions like, ""How much alcohol have you drunk in the past week?"" and ""As a score out of 20, how would you rate your health?"" and so forth. I personally don't drink very often, but I find it infantilising that to access this treatment I'm asked these intrusive questions about whether I've had a glass of wine when I get home in the evening.

I currently use about a gram a month; when I get some money I buy a gram, and smoke it in the evening or on the weekend. It's frustrating that when I see this government counsellor, she has a very judgmental attitude about this. I make the point to her that some people like to have a glass of wine or a joint, I personally like to smoke some dope (of the opioid kind) to relax. I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that, if it's not interfering with my other obligations. But her own attitude inclines her to  abstinence (I think she used to be a user herself, and now she has an evangelical attitude to NA), she's even very skeptical about methadone. In this country some people get heroin prescriptions (though they're as rare as hen's teeth; only consultant psychiatrists with a special government licence can prescribe it, and the government is not issuing new licences). These patients get liquid pharmaceutical diamorphine in ampoules, and clean syringes along with it. She mentioned a client of theirs who has been on this prescription for 20 years, has a family and a successful business, and she thought it was ""sad"" that he'd ""numbed his feelings for two decades"". That seems so strange to me; it doesn't seem sad, it seems like a success story.

He seems like yet another person who manages to compartmentalise his use. I just personally do not see that opioids are inherently evil; it depends entirely on how the person uses them and the affect it has on their life. I suppose my experience is that if you have money, it's much easier to make that compartmentalisation work; if you don't have to scrabble around to get the cash, you can afford to buy larger amounts less often, and spend more time focusing on your other pursuits and interests and obligations.

To me that is a good argument for why this stuff should be available for free to anyone who needs it, otherwise the negative effects of opioids become as much a class issue as a health issue. If you have money then you are more insulated from the negative effects. Having said that, I also know rich people who have been absolutely wrecked by using.",1491309792.0

Update: My choice of drugs is my choice. Why do you care what drugs I use? I wouldn't go around to you saying ""DMT is bad"", or ""weed is bad"". So please, stfu about my meth use.

Tl;dr: for the small price of $244, you can take illicit drugs without being paranoid of cops. 

I can't believe this. I was approved to be a ""researcher"" with the DEA. I can now take Schedule 2 controlled substances such as methamphetamine/cocaine/morphine (I'm gonna lay off the morphine though). 

Researches can run clinical trials on Schedule 2 - Schedule 5 controlled substances legally, on animals or HUMANS. This even includes giving methamphetamine to someone else and they can get high as long as they are on my ""research site"" (but in order to give it to someone else, you must register the ""clinical trial"" on clinicaltrials.gov, which literally takes up to 2 mins, however, you can legally give it to yourself without sending the data to ClinicalTrials.gov). I highly suggest this, it's really fun to play video games and get high with your friends. This is pretty much the same thing Alexander Shulgin did with PiHKaL, except he signed up for a schedule 1 - research, but unfourtunatly for schedule 1 drugs, you do need an IND sponsor (don't even try, I tried getting an IND sponser, and even tried applying to become an IND researcher but lost tons of money with no results) 

How to do this:

Step 1: Make sure that your local state doesn't require a ""license"" for possession of controlled substances. California, for example, doesn't. In most cases, states that require it, require medicinal degree of some sort. 

Step 2: https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/webforms/jsp/regapps/common/newAppLogin.jsp

Step 3: Click ""Researcher"" under form 225. You will have to mail a check payable to ""Drug Enforcement Administration"" in the amount of $244. No credit cards:( (even though it says Visa/MC is accepted, it wasn't accepting any of my cards, until I finally decided to mail a check).

Step 4: Fill in the forms.

Step 5: Mail the check, wait up to 2 weeks and you'll recieve a letter in the mail with your permit. 

If you want to stay 100% legal, you will have to keep the drugs in a locked cabinet on the research premise (which can be your house). But you can be high and leave the premise. 

After you sign up, here is where you can buy EXTREMELY PURE legal meth/cocaine from (mods, tell me if you want this removed, I'm just trying to keep people legal and safe. This can save lives - no dealing with shady people, verified purity backed by the law, and no risk of arrests. Also, Sigma is a company owned by Merck, not affiliated with it, and I am not advertising it for my own financial gain): buy legal meth here

UPDATE: Just came to me why this is so easy and the government allows this. The DEA is probably trying to get recreational drug users to sign up to the permit. I mean considering that without the permit recreational drug users will anyways manage to buy drugs illegally, the drugs they buy can be low quality and therefore hazardous, plus they are supporting Mexican drug cartels and avoid paying taxes. The US government would rather have the people who will anyways use drugs pay taxes on the drugs, support US organizations instead of Mexican gangs, and stay healthy (impurities). I mean if I was the US government, this is what I would do.

In all honesty, the controlled substance isn't that bad as I thought. They just want to keep drug abusers off the streets, like what happened in the 1970's with the meth epidemic, by verifying they are not homeless and have a physical ""research facility"". They still allow the sale and purchase of them with a license. I'm sure anyone here doesn't wanna see crazy people on the streets every day the walk outside.",1491294063.0

Few years ago, I would take 30-50mg hydrocodone every once in a blue moon to scratch the opiate itch, but I've avoided oxies or any thing stronger. Hydros are shit enough that they don't trigger the full on junkie mentality in me, but good enough to satisfy the occasional craving. It's been a while since I've bought pills though, and I've been hearing about Fent being in every thing. My addiction to opiates was from around 2008-2011 or so, and back then, the pills were almost always real and if you could find fent, it was the patches and you would pay good money for it. It's kinda surreal to know it's being put in all sorts of stuff now, but things have changed.

Any way, my main question is the title. I know most street oxy is fent but I'm not looking for that shit any way. Are hydros generally safe? I've heard that Norcos and Watson 853s have been known to have fent on occasion so I'd try to avoid those. Also been hearing about pressed bars lately. Are footballs usually legit? My boy is the same guy I've known for like, 9 years now and he always had legit pills back in the day, fronted me hundreds of dollars and let me owe him for months etc. so we have some trust built up he wouldn't sell me bunk shit. I actually called the dude up a while back to warn him about the fent shit, cause he's a pretty decent guy for a drug dealer and refused to sell any thing but pills and never messed with coke or dope or used any drugs himself.

It breaks my heart and annoys me at the same time that good people are dying because of the fentanyl infested pills and smack that is being pushed on the streets especially in the US.
Why?
Because there is a solution to this problem.
The Dark Net Markets.
I haven't copped in person in 6 years. I've been using the DNMs ever since and with a cautious selection of vendors I have never been let down by neither the quality nor the price.
Just some examples:
A legit 30 box of 80mg lannacher oxycodone is 125 Eur
A legit 1 gram of 80-90% pure No.4 heroin straight from a guy in Thailand is 180 USD
Both been lab-tested by private labs.

Of course I know that it is not easy to set it up for the average Joe (luckily I majored in computer science from a great university in the UK) but with a little effort it CAN BE DONE.
Not to mention if set up right you are incredibly safe from Law Enforcement. (This is coming from someone who knows a thing or two about cybersecurity and cyberlaw)
Please guys if you value your life and want to put quality drugs into your body and not junk consider it! Look it up!

Plus I've been thinking and I decided that I will make a very straightforward guide how to do the whole thing, from setting up your hardware/software to how to find trustworthy vendors and how to stay safe if ANYONE is INTERESTED. Just comment here or send me a PM.

Please guys don't take this the wrong way I'm just trying to help:)

Stay safe and stay high

Edit:

/r/darknetmarketsnoobs is a great subreddit with tutorials and people happy to help you out in setting it up.

I will be posting a straightforward but in depth tutorial here on how to set up and access DNMs in the next few days. Be sure to stay tuned!",1491282309.0

Shes ""sober"" now, 12 days or so, but it never lasts. It didn't last when she went to jail for 7 months. It's been a nightmare because we all just pretend it's not a real problem. She's the perfect mom. Cleans the house, makes dinner every night, takes care of the pets, does the grocery shopping, runs every day. A completely functioning addict. I just don't know what happened to her that made her so broken. I remember on family vacation two years ago, a beachside hotel room in Montauk, and opening the bathroom drawer and seeing her spoon and needle. And thinking ""How are you shooting up with your beautiful family on a beach in Montauk?"" That moment really changed things for me. I just kind of accepted her for who she was instead of fighting it. My dad pays for the habit, she runs around with the debit card and doesn't work because she's too ""mentally ill"". I don't know. It's just rough. It's rough to love someone so much - the one person I know from the inside out - and feeling like she's killing her self. But being on here has really humanized her for me...somehow.

2. If you do in fact get pulled over, leave a car seat in the back. Bonus points if you leave some scattered toys, maybe even a bottle, but just make sure you have a backstory. Cops prob won't ask you about it, but it could be the difference between searching your car and not searching it. This is most beneficial when you are a minority.

In April she upped it to 60, then in May to 90, in June to 120 and in July switched me to the 10mg pills (my suggestion which I still can't believe she followed) for a quantity of 60, instructions take 2-3x/day.


At my first pain management appointment they wrote me for the full 90 based on the instructions my GP had written on the bottle, so in a way they did up my script but since then it's been steady. I've done every suggestion they had, from injections in my back, neck (HORRIBLE WOULD NOT RECOMMEND) and wrists and attending PT and I am soon to purchase a TENS unit. I have also been taking Topamax and Gabapentin (which I HATE because it makes me eat like crazy but it does help with anxiety.) The anxiety component is especially important because after almost a decade of being on benzodiazepines (first scripted Ativan in '08), my psychiatrist is finally tapering me off of my Klonopin which my pain clinic is happy about. I am hoping this will help open the door for a higher script.


So having said all of that, my pain is controlled from a half-hour after I wake up between 6-7am until about 10:30 AM when I'm begging for my second dose and have to wait until 12-1pm, because I know I'll need my third dose by 4pm and it's hell trying to sleep at 9-10pm when the meds have worn off. My goal is to get rid of the APAP because I'm sick of taking a gram of it a day and to hopefully add another 10mg a day.


Ideally I would like to switch to OP 10-15s 2x/day plus 2-3 5-10mg IRs for breakthrough pain, but I know I can really get myself in hot water for specifically asking for something. My 9-month appointment is next Tuesday and I was thinking of saying something along the lines of, ""My medication isn't working to it's full potential anymore and I'm getting nervous about the amount of Tylenol I'm taking in daily. I know that it's within safe limits, but I have to take Ibuprofen almost daily for inflammation so I'm wondering if there's a way we can tweak my current script.""


This is especially difficult for me because of my age (28) and as everyone knows, the new CDC ""recommendations."" However I have several chronic illnesses that do require around-the-clock treatment and I have scans to back them up. I'm hoping this thread can help others as well who are in the same predicament.


Thanks in advance everyone! I know how fortunate I am to get anything at all during these times which is why I have held off asking until now.

About a week ago I purchased six Dilaudid 8s, and used three of them in one night along with a quarter of a Xanax. I was pretty fucked up, and I don't remember much of the night. The next day I woke up late and ran straight to work. Work was pretty chill, and all day I was looking forward to the three Dillys that I had waiting for me at home. Once I got home I went straight to my backpack, but the pills were not in there. No big deal, I looked in several of my usual hiding spots. After 15 minutes or so, I still could not find the pills, and I started to get a bit frantic. My boyfriend and I proceeded to flip the entire house over for the pills. We spent four and a half hours searching for them. For some reason I kept thinking that I put them in the lid of something, but I just could not remember. I eventually gave up and decided that they would eventually show up. Tonight I went and copped as usual, so I have been fucked yo for a few hours. About ten minutes ago I grabbed my old (it's practically empty and I have two new ones) deodorant. While I was putting it the lid back on I noticed that there was plastic in it, and I immediately knew that it was the baggie that held my missing pills. I am sooo fucking stoked. I'm so glad I didn't lose them forever. 😩😝😩😝😩

When I use an acid to break down the hard is that just turning it back into normal cocaine(cocaine hydrochloride, i think)?

And after I've broken it down is it safe to heat with my dope while prepping my shot? Should I use two cookers and cook separately and mix the finished products? Should I just add the hard after I cook up my dope, because no heat is required for the hard to break down.

The next general question: I have been using Crytal Light packets and kool aid packets to break it down. Are these any safer than vinegar? I prefer the packets because they're easy to carry and you only need a pinch to get the job done.

Soak in water in a glass bowl or canning jar in the sunshine. Strain. Make another batch with the same flowers. Or soak in the sunshine lover night to make sun tea.

Drinking the mother flower essence undiluted gave me euphoria and no desire to go on the internet using a computer and an ethernet cable. I don't use a mobile phone nor wi-fi. I had the desire to sun bathe, walk my dog, pet my dog, meet new people, party and earth barefoot.

The euphoria lasted two days. Lacking the desire to go on the internet lasted 3 days. Today, I picked more California flowers to make flower essence and partook.

There are no papers published in medical journals on california poppy treating addiction. California poppy is known to have sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic effects. I didn't feel mentally or physically sedated. I thought about more topics. I was physically energized.

I have tried valerian tincture and passionflower for dizziness due to brain zapping. These herbs also treat anxiety though I do not have anxiety. The herbs didn't have the same effect as California poppy.

I do not think California poppy's effects are due to very low dose morphine:

>Interestingly, we have shown in the present work that aerial parts of E. californica contain (S)-reticuline. It has been shown [23] that this compound may be transformed by neuroblastoma cells into morphine, which is known to bind to μ-opioid receptors. The latter observation could explain why pure (S)-reticuline isolated from Ocotea duckei acted as potent central nervous system depressant [24].

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4609799/

Last year, environmental medicine physician #1 prescribed low dose naltrexone for immunosuppression. I didn't feel any effects from it. I switched to the amino acid n-acetylcysteine (NAC). This past year, I had only one cold and no bronchitis. My immunoglobulin and interferon-gamma will be retested.

I further researched NAC and had submitted a post on NAC treating internet addiction.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Electromagnetics/comments/4kb59n/j_addiction_treatment_nacetyl_cysteine_nac_treats

Daily dose of one gram of NAC created an immediately significant decline of internet addiction. Daily dose of two grams more improvement. I would like to increase my daily dose to 4 grams but I am not capable of digesting lots of capsules and tablets. I would need to not take another supplement to be able to increase NAC to 4 grams. The supplements I take are based on lab tests. I cannot stop taking any of them. I do research and purchase liquid forms of supplements when available. Fortunately, herbs can be drunk as tincture, tea or flower essence. Two grams of NAC together with California poppy has brought freedom from internet addiction!

Does California poppy work the same way as NAC? NAC is a treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). So is opium. I do not have OCD and don't have any other addiction. Addiction needs to be recognized as an obsession and treated as such. I don't have opium to compare California poppy to. According to the paper cited above, (S)-reticuline in California poppy is similar.

>Henry Maudsley published an 1895 psychiatric textbook that recommended prescribing such patients opium and morphine, to be taken three times a day, and suggested that adding low doses of arsenic along with these narcotics could be helpful.5 Writing at the turn of the century, Pierre Janet (1859-1947) noted that he would sometimes prescribe opium, though ""the danger of addiction usually outweighs the potential benefits.""6

https://www.ocdhistory.net/nutshell/1800s.html

Poppy seeds is an ayurvedic treatment for dizziness. I purchased poppy seeds at an Indian grocery store to make poppy tea. I ate poppy seeds. Not the same effect as California poppy flowers. Indian poppy seeds only slightly decreased dizziness. I stopped eating it. Indian poppy seeds did not have the same effect as California poppy flowers. Would California poppy seeds have the same effect as Indian poppy seeds? I will buy seeds to test and compare.

I think California poppy flowers have an unique alkaloid. Does the opium flower papaver somniferum? The Flanders poppy, papaver rhoeas, does to a lesser extent.

Since spring is here, if you feel inspired to test California poppy, please do tell.

I am capable of making decisions that will keep my body and my mind healthy for years to come, so now, I'm heeding all the advice you gave me when I posted on here. I'm done, guys. I've done my experimentation, and it's just not something I want to dedicate my life to. Walking home, I realized how far I could have been sucked up into this life. I had no problem meeting a complete stranger for drugs after binging for only a few days, so who knows where a month would have taken me. I think I can say, with decent certainty, that you, Reddit, have saved my life. It may not be that big a deal to you guys, but it is to me. Thank you.",1491355533.0

The first attempt to retrieve one was from Shoppers Drug Mart, where the pharmacist said no, you have to be overdosing to get one and sent him on his way. 
Today he went in to Costco to ask for one, to which the lady responded that they don't give anything away for free! 
She then brought another pharmacist over for him to ask and though the pharmacist there did give him one, he said to look up the instructions online!

WITH PROLOGUE (x-post: /r/Cocaine),"Met a dude on the bus about a week ago after he overheard my conversation on the phone. I think it's extremely obnoxious to talk about any kinds of drug transactions (even weed) in any space where people who might be bothered by it might hear you. I'm sure the passengers of my packed yet silent bus *loved* hearing me saying how many bags of heroin I wanted to buy, and naming all kinds of different prices since this guy wanted my business . I mean, obviously your texts are being monitored when you're a homeless panhandler .. in which case talking on the phone is *way* less incriminating . Almost everyone I've met who does this is just a middleman (and those that act like a douche on the phone and try to bully me, acting like they're doing me a favor, I spitefully save as a drug contact .. this guy's name went from ""DJ Bob"" to ""DJ HeroinDealer"").

-/-

ANYWAY, dude on the bus is super chill, and he ends up mentioning ""yeah I'm on my way to score too .. I just can't seem to stay on the subs :( ). I'd been trying to find Subutex forever to detox and we quickly swapped numbers. I met up with him today to pick up two, and gave him 3, 4mg pressed bars. They were outrageously expensive (I only buy pressies when I'm desperate, anyway .. I'd rather buy a football or a kpin from someone I know with a legit script than risk getting a research chemical or simply not knowing how strong the pill will be), so he was supposed to give me 2, 8mg Subutex and $10 for the bars. Idk if he was playing games, but he thought I meant that *I'd* be giving him the $10. To offset the cost, he gave me a dime of crack and a used crack pipe.

As you can imagine, the crack is long gone lol, but there's plenty of resin. I read that there is a chemical you can use to clean it out and once it evaporates, you can smoke what is left over. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?",1491353048.0

Do interventions work? Not the ""this is how you're hurting US"" type, but the ""we care about you and love you"" type.","Some of you have followed this story I'm sure, but it isn't super relevant to this question. My mom has been abusing her opiate painkilllers and ones she gets overseas for years and I gave her a bunch when I was prescribed them recently and she kinda a lot further with lying and drug seeking after and I've never seen that in the past with her. Maybe I'm being too hard on her, but being super supportive of my condition while I was getting the pills and then convincing me that I'm not disabled just so you can feel less guilty about taking my pills I gave you is fucked up to me. A direct quote: ""I have more pain than you could ever make up"". She recommended my 17 year old brother take one of my morphine just to beat the piss test so I could keep getting the pills for her. I care about you being addicted to pills mom, but you can't do these things to your children. She's is reaching delusional levels of denial about her addiction. I saw a counselor about the anger I was feeling and am feeling better about that.  I'm successfully able to lie to her face and the rest of my families face and say that I was just being an ass and that she's not an addict, but I still want her to get better. At the same time I feel for her, I wouldn't want to just be left alone with my addiction if I was her, but I don't know. She called me today and was talking about her crazy ex husband randomly ambushing me at college yesterday, and she told me ""I've never been happier without him, I've never been so happy, so calm, so not worried"" and it broke my heart because I don't think she's happy. I know it makes her so upset when I accuse her of being an addict, especialy when I say it in a rude way where it completely sounds like an attack. I've screamed it at her, and I know it must make her just want to go get high. I don't know how to tell her I don't want to drive with her considering shes always fucked up. I was being an ass on here the other day, but I have to see her point of view, and not just think about myself. Because people don't get clean for someone else, they only do it for themselves.      
      
I'm trying to at least get the rest of the family to see what's happening, but I called an addiction hotline and they said a good first step after that would be an intervention. I was immediately skeptical as I've read on these parts of reddit how interventions only help the family feel better and shame the addict, but if it helps her confront this issue and long term helps her get better then I'm okay with approaching her as a family in a supportive and loving manner. Trust me, all I want is for this to go away. but considering the rate of her stomach surgeries in the recent decade I think she's going to kill herself with her drinking on apap/acetometaphin filled overseas pills. Or maybe she's not, and I need to shut up and stop pretending I know so much with my 19 years experience on this earth.      
       
Anyone who has been on either end of an intervention, knows a better way to do this, or any advice, even telling me to buzz of and mind my own business, please share some insight. I really do value the opinion of many if not most of the individuals in this sub, and I'm beyond fucking lost on what to do. ",1491350804.0

I did not know the answer so I told him I didn't know and of course told him he should always play it safe and if possible have his drugs tested. He said it was not possible for him. I gave him some narcan in case and asked him no to do the drug alone. Of course now I am a little worried.

He is not supposed to bring drugs into external therapy like we offer but I am pretty sure he was under the influence so me lecturing him was moot at best.

Flew to Florida and was at a trap and even did oxymorphone 5mg IR. I did 2 of those and there was no real effect that I felt. On top, I did so much coke as well and one of the guys there I saw just turned me off do much. This guy looked like a zombie literally. He was injecting adderall, iving coke, IM oxymorphone, taking valium, and not sleeping for days. His eyes were so red that you could only see red.

On the 3rd I celebrated 10 months clean. It can be done guys. I still have my moments when I get cravings and miss heroin. But it's short lived. I have been on 4mg of suboxone a day. And I'm going down to 2mg , to start getting off it. I have six more months of drug court and I'm a free man, with my felony going away. I can honestly say drug court saved my life. I overdosed twice in the month prior to me getting locked up and going to rehab. 

People ask me how I stopped. And it was because I was locked away for awhile and that really opened my eyes. Prison hanging over my head wasn't enough for me to stop because I still used when I first was on drug court. It wasn't until I had a solid 3 months away from heroin. That I finally said enough is enough. So what I'm getting at is if your truly ready to quit. Don't be afraid to commit to a long term rehab stint. Imo 28 days is not enough.

And a big thing that helps me stay clean is helping other addicts.  I'm not saying through na either. Na is not really my thing. I don't really believe in a lot of there ideals. I like to talk to other addicts give them advice. Or just be someone they can vent too. I also am fortunate to be able to tell my story to parent support group that have loved ones in active addict addiction. And can answer there questions. 

I often read your post and can relate to everything you guys go through. It reminds me how crazy this addiction is. Keep your heads up guys. And feel free to pm me. ",1491492236.0

I have no fucking clue if it was a defective needle or what because it was never severely bent but take it as a lesson to TRY TO ALWAYS USE CLEAN RIGS.

 I panicked and went to the ER. after waiting 8 hours for nothing (a script of antibiotics and the suggestion to contact a surgeon) I was sent on my way. in those long 8 hrs I went online and read about other people who had been in my situation. I read that most other people were also sent home. This is because its a pretty vascular area and most doctors dont want to risk surgery over something so small.

at this point im on the last day of antibiotics (cephalexin) and the needle is starting to surface under my skin. theres not a whole lot of pain but its unmistakably the tip of the needle. theres also a small bubble on one end. my question is, do you think my body will naturally reject this or should i contact a surgeon? what kind of specialist would I even call? I have good health insurance so its not a problem going to see one.

63qj6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/63qj6x/got_ripped_off_today/,4,https://redd.it/63qj6x,Little_Sorrow,Got ripped off today.,"First time this has happened in a couple years, and I'm **pissed.** My main dealer's phone was ""not accepting calls at this time"" for hours, so I called two of my backups. Unfortunately both of my backups are middles and both of them were waiting on other people too. Finally I get a call back from Kathy (not her real name) saying that her son, Danny, just picked up and she's going to have him call me. 

He calls me and I go meet him and he gives me empty fucking bags. They were inside a cellophane, rubber banded together, and we met in a parking lot so the hand-off was quick. I honestly never even considered that he'd rip me off, since *his own mother* was the one to send me to him. I trust her completely and she's not even using now, so I know that she didn't set me up or anything. But what kind of scumbag jacks someone his *mother* sent? In my mind he pretty much just jacked *her.*

The only good thing to come of this was that Kathy gave me her connect after I told her what had happened. 

I really couldn't afford for this to happen today. I borrowed money from a couple people last week who I really needed to pay back today, and I had enough to pay them back and get a little dope. Well, there goes my dope fund. Luckily I managed to scrape enough together to get high after that, but it definitely wasn't anywhere close to what I needed to be completely comfortable. 

At the same time this is going on, I managed to help out a new friend who I'd never helped before. I bought myself some bags from the new connect to  make sure they were decent, because I wanted to make a good first impression on this guy in the hopes of gaining an ongoing mutually beneficial arrangement. They were fine-- a little small, but the dope was decent. So I grabbed a bundle for the new friend and met up with him, only to have him text me later to say that he shot 5 of them and didn't get high off of it. He did kick me down a bag out of what I got him and I didn't notice a difference at all between the bundle I got high off of and the bag from the bundle that he said contained no dope. So now I have no idea what's going on. This guy has no reason to trust me but I'd **never** rip someone off like that, and I'm worried that he thinks I did it on purpose. It's just weird that I got high off what I presume was the same batch, since I bought his bundle only about 45 minutes after I bought mine. 

Also, this came from the new connect that I got after getting ripped off, so now I'm hesitant to use him again. Maybe the kid just has a super high tolerance or took subs too recently or something... I don't know.

All in all it was a shitty fucking day. Just had to vent. Thanks for reading.

It feels like 3 years have gone by so fast. I used to be incredibly social, out-going, enjoyed the work grind, always moving. Now I feel like a shell of my former self. 

Idk if I've just grown up and slowed down, but I struggle to keep in touch with the friends who will still even talk to me. I don't know what I would do without my boyfriend, but we both agreed we can't keep living in the use/sick cycle. 

I was doing well only using 1-2x a week and subbing for the rest, but the days ive been sick this week are really effecting my ability to clean, interview, go out and function at all. I feel like I'm not contributing to society and that the world is moving on without me. I want to jump out of my skin, I'm restless, but bored by everything at the same time. 

I feel like I just woke up one day and was 26, feeling like a total loser. I have my degree from a good school, too. Idk why I'm struggling to find a job. But I need to get my shit together. I feel like everyone else has their shit together. 

I don't even really enjoy ""the game"" anymore. I was getting amazing stuff, likely cut with fent, for the past month and it's left me way sick off coming down, even with subs. I was puking while I was using, high as fuck, but sick off it. The dope I've gotten this week barely keeps me well. I can't keep going through this but I'm worried I'm just going to be depressed for mad long. Even on subs. 

Sorry for the disorganized ramble. I just don't even know who to talk to anymore besides me boyfriend. Some of my closest friends that live near me bailed when they found out what I was going through. So much for best friends. Any words are appreciated. Thanks. 

I don't want to get arrested or see anyone get hurt. I want to by myself again. I just have to get through this. I haven't rly had more than a month clean in a while, even on subs. ",1491440531.0

63or4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/63or4d/looking_from_guidance/,9,https://redd.it/63or4d,PhillyBroCo,Looking from guidance,"Hey everyone. So it's reached the point where I can see the future... and surprise it's  pretty bleak.

My friend and I started taking opana recreationally last summer. Initially it was once every 2-3 weeks. Then toward the end of the year we upped it to about 2 times per week. By February we were up to 4 times per week. But March is where I can look back and see the tipping point. I started doing it pretty much every single day. In the past two weeks not only have I done it every single day, but the majority of the day has been spent high.

I went through my first day of withdrawal yesterday. Again no surprise, it sucked. I did some today to stop going through withdrawal/ I can see now that this is quickly turning into a problem. I’m scared. I know that this is probably the most important battle of my life so far and I am determined to win.

I know that the best approach is probably to just quit cold turkey, but there are some problems with that. I work in a fairly high stress engineering role that requires me to be very sharp during the day. Yesterday was a bit of a disaster as I was unable to concentrate and do the creative thinking necessary to perform in the role. We have a big product going into production in a few weeks and I don’t think I will be able to quit until then, lest I risk being fired.

Until then, I am hoping I can do a bit of a taper to avoid going through what I did yesterday while still preparing to quit around the end of the month. Right now I do about 40mg of opana per day. My plan is to cut that by about 10mg per week so I am down to 10mg per day around the time I want to quit. Any critique of this plan is appreciated.

1) I have some questions as well. Is it possible to do an infinite taper? Gradually decrease the amount you are taking each week until you are eventually taking close to nothing? If so what are the pros and cons of such an approach,

2) Is there an alternative way to do tapers by increasing the time instead of the dose? For example, first space your doses out every 12 hours, then 15 hours, then 18 hours etc. Feasible? Pros and Cons?

3) How proportionally bad are withdrawals with the dosage? For example, is a withdrawal from 30mg per day considerable worse than a withdrawal from 20 mg per day or is it not even noticeable. 

This is my first post on reddit, but I have a few more I hope to put out discussing strategy and other ideas that will help me quit. I don’t believe in God, but I am praying that something out there helps me through this because right now, things look really dark. I know what I am dealing with is nothing compared with what most of you have gone through, but its very real and very scary for me right now so I appreciate all of you for your help.

P.S. I know the line about not wanting to quit cold turkey is a rationalization. It is a rationalization, but there is some truth to it as well. I appreciate any comments criticizing or commenting on this decision, but no matter what I do think I won’t be able to attempt a cold turkey quit until then. Whether that is most because of the reality of the situation or my own mental weakness, I am unsure.

Also if anybody is willing to talk, would you please PM me?

Thats not an issue for me since i have other landing gear on hand.

Im wondering if anyone has a MG ratio for both H and meth in one dose? Example H = 50MG / Meth = 50MGs for 100GM shot. Any thoughts on this? I usually do 100MG per shot of both substances. Perhaps the H should be higher and the Ice lower but i figured I would ask here since im sure someones done this.

I made a long post a bit ago talking about my pathetic romance with Fu-F. I basically nodded 30 days in a row without breaks and almost killed myself with it in combination with Xanax. That was on Christmas Eve. I wanted to never try opioids again, but now suddently the cravings came back and I thought about how content I was just doing nothing on it. A few minutes ago I ordered 250 milligrams of Furanylfentanyl again. I just want to feel the same way again. This time I will not have benzos available, so that should minimize overdose potential. Naturally after a long break, I will start with a very low dose, but here is my question: is my tolerance back to baseline again after 4 months? Also, if I can control myself to only dose like once, every two days - not saying I could - would there be withdrawl? How fast does physical dependancy develop?

Man, I have mixed feelings. I am depressed and nostalgic and really want to feel content and happy again but on the other hand I am scared of my little self control and idiotic behavior by ordering again.

Me and a friend of mine want to try various substances, including opioids, even though this sub constantly says that it's a class of substances one should not fuck with.
Anyways, I already decided that I don't want to miss out on trying them. So far i have done Kratom, Codeine and Tramadol.
Since I would describe myself as an thoroughly responsible user, i want to take all precautions possible/necessary, which also is the reason for me writing this post.
We got a patch containing 8.4mg of fent with an release rate of 50ug/h. From what I've read so far, this is way too much. At the moment i think about bisecting it thrice, leaving me with 8 pieces, me and my friend each taking one, which makes 6,25ug/h if done correctly.
Since harm reduction is this subs mission, I'd really like to hear your opinion on this one.
Oh and btw, I got no problems limiting my consumption of drugs, I take kratom once a week on average, but mainly as a social event, not primarily for the high itself.

Finished my last roxy at 4pm Saturday and have been doing well since. I spent all Sunday masturbating when I got home after my male friend left (it's crazy how much orgasms help WD) and the rest of the evening shitting and shaking. Leg kicks were the worst Sun night but have gone away since then. I feel like my withdrawals aren't as difficult because instead of focusing on getting high to ease them I'm focused on healing. I got my roommate/ex-boyfriend/girlfriend (it's complicated) to clean my room of all paraphernalia. She missed my roxy washes so I took them Monday morning just to set my soul at ease and washed my wash yesterday out of force of habit. Today I put my spoon back in the kitchen. I haven't unpacked from this weekend, I'm stinky and sweaty and have my period on top of everything else but even through so much pain, suffering, and weakness I feel incredible strength and am proud of myself for the first time since I dove headfirst into this addiction at the tender age of 14. Kratom has helped a lot along with a dear friend who is staying with me this week. In the past I figured I would have to do this on a week off but working Monday-Friday 1-7 is a good distraction or I would more than likely be obsessing.

I realize it, I admit it and I want to stop immediately. I have been chipping for the past year. Started off with once a month- once a week- and most recently every other day. I only snort and never shoot. This week I stopped and I was very fatigued, body ached, overall just felt bad. But not completely miserable like others have described. 
I want to stop completely. What is the best way to do this? Should I just suck it up and stop cold turkey, and deal with the withdrawals? How long should I expect them to last before feeling normal again?

Should I go to a clinic? Would suboxone or methadone be an option? I have an important job so, this would need to be kept very private and going away is not an option. I know mentally I can beat this shit and not do it but I just need to get past the intitial withdrawals. I have no experience with this, I am scared and any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Golden rule #1:** DO NOT get too comfortable. NEVER get too comfortable.

**Rule #2:** Keep your kit out of sight, hidden and somewhere that your households will _never_ find. Locked box, in honey bun, etc.

**Rule #3:** _DO NOT NOD AROUND THEM._ Do not use too much around them. Do not use to the point that you would be extremely noddy. Definitely do not use benzodiazepine - it will make you more sleepy than usual. 

**Rule #4:** Do not do anything out of ordinary. they'll start suspecting, investigate and they will catch up.

**Rule #5:** If you feel that they suspect something is up, they do suspect that something is up and they're waiting for next hint & clue. Change up your routine and behavior.

**Rule #6** Don't get sick constantly around them. They'll be suspicious. Opiates withdrawal doesn't have fever and it's easy to identify the difference between simple flu and opiates withdrawal (sweating, vomiting, lack of sleep, etc)

**Rule #7:** DO NOT get too comfortable. NEVER get too comfortable.

That they don't have an education or that they are unemployable; that they are just generally bad people who deserve bad things to happen to them.

  I understand that this idea does not come from other users - any mildly seasoned user would know that there are a variety of different kind of abusers. There are the ones who keep their shit together, work a proper job and/or go to school, keep a healthy relationship with their families and friends (who are not limited to other abusers) and live a functioning life, there are those who are the stereotypical ""dirty junkie"" you picture in the movies, who may be homeless, shoot up in the the neighborhood park, and have burned bridges with everyone in their lives just to get high; and then there's everyone and everything in between. This idea seems to come from people who don't use, have vowed to never use, and likely don't even know someone or are close with someone who uses. 

  If I ever end up mentioning my habit, I frequently get surprised, disgusted or curious looks along with the ""But you don't look like an addict"" that ensues. That statement is normally followed by conversations about hard drug usage and why I personally do it. Which inevitably more or less ends in something along the lines of ""Why don't you just quit?"" 

  To anyone whose not using, that seems simple right? ""Why are you *choosing* to struggle when you can just quit and be done with it all? Why not lead a clean and sober life away from the sketchiness and deceit that comes with hard use?"" Most people who have lead a relatively sober life don't understand the difficulties that come with trying to get clean. If it were so easy then there would be no need for detox centers and rehabs. If quitting was as easy as ""just quitting"" then there would be no such thing as a heroin epidemic. Yes, there are plenty of people who are able to quit, but that doesn't make it any easier. I even had one person who had never used in their life tell me that I should just quit. After all, they had quit biting their nails after 10 years, how hard could it be? I've seen friends writhe in pain, unable to sleep between the restless legs, the vomiting, the fever, the upset stomach and hot and cold flashes. It is not an easy thing to do. I applaud any addict who has the will and has tried like many of us to get clean; but unless you have been an addict at some point yourself, your words are nothing but hollow shells. 
An addict could be anyone, whether you know it or not. Addiction does not discriminate; it could be your younger sibling, you mother, your father, your friend from high school, the rich girl down the street, your therapist, your physician, the model you see on your Sunday morning commercials. Literally *anyone*. So wether you've been clean all your life or just think hard drugs and the people are use it are wrong; educate yourself before you start spouting about how easy it would be to get clean. Or how everyone who uses is a despicable human being, who deserve to be raped and treated like the junkies they are (I've heard that one more than once). Some of us are completely functioning members of society; some have families, own homes, have jobs, a college education, girlfriends/boyfriends, a healthy relationship with their loved ones... Hell, I even know some who voluntarily participate in community service.

  While I can't speak for others, I take complete responsibility in my choice to use and my struggle with addiction. I'm not asking for sympathy, I'm asking people, especially those who have never battled any demon like addiction, to think before they jump to conclusions. Not everyone in this scene is a sketchy drug-seeking rat. It doesn't help anyone when you put another down for something they battle with everyday. ",1491566442.0

I work at a dealership in the car service centre. So while I'm pulling the first car of the day into the workshop for the mechanics to get to work on - I open up the centre console and what should I find?

The car is scheduled for a clutch replacement with parts we won't even have in stock till Monday - so whoever these belong do didn't think much of leaving them in a car that they wouldn't even get back for at least 4 days. Obviously I took a bunch - 12 to be exact! But it wouldn't have even been a quarter of what was in the bottle. Not to mention the label on it was ripped off, and the bottle itself actually looked kinda old. So I'm thinking these might not even be script legitimate. Either way i was staring down the barrel of WD at the start of long ass shift so nothing was gonna stop me really.. in fact it's gonna take all the willpower I have not to go back into the car and grab a bunch more - or even just swiping the whole damn bottle!

But this feels like shit, no euphoria, just wish I had Kratom instead now. Anyone experience this? Any way to save this high? I have 20mg more that I wanna take, but based on how I feel now, it seems like it won't do anything. Could Kratom have fucked my tolerance that much?

I know the title sounds ironic, but I have been trying to find an opiate other than potentiated kratom (w/dxm) for a very long time. With enough DXM and kratom, I can get a pretty good opi-effect, but the dex makes it too dirty. It's nasty and makes my stomach feel off, but it's cheap and works

Someone offered me trams today... found out it was **$20 for 75mg (1 1/2 pills)**... I'm pretty sure I can cop a box of 100x100mg for $60 online, so that's a terrible terrible terrible deal.

I could get good pills, but honestly it just costs way too much. $20 for a 20mg oxycodone, which would last me a day or two (I have a low tolerance). 

I've had supplies of up to 30 oxy's before when my friend's mom died... I made that last me 4 or 5 months no problem.

Fent pressed oxy's are cheap as hell, but scare me, due to hotspots and the fact that ""30mg pressed blues"" are equivalent to 100mg of oxy. Not opposed to heroin, but would not IV.

How much more addictive is heroin than oxycodone? Is it even worth it if you aren't shooting up?

Any advice on my situation? Or is potentiated kratom still my best bet. I don't want to go hard, I just want something that's less than $1/mg oxy's that I can use occasionally like before.

Now coming up my last week that I have to get my prescription weekly. After that it will be once a month. My question is will they be able to see the change in my suboxone intake? I am going to talk to them Monday about maybe upping my dose or seeing what they say about it. I just don't see how they can pinpoint my exact intake when a urine test depends on so much(water intake, metabolism, etc..).

I would wake up with the sheets soaked through,  diarrhea,  pupils so big I cant see my brown, tremors,  hell, yall know this.   I'm on day 12 and still feel like I'm I'm a fresh hell every day and dont know how much longer I can handle. Just at day 12 I managed to get Ambien, Klonopin and Wellbutrin from a very compassionate Dr.  Every day i feel like getting high to end this. The restless legs are so bad I wanna pull my muscles out of my legs. Monster anxiety, diarrhea on day 12 still, insomnia so bad i only get a out 3 hrs. I experienced auditory hallucinations about day 7. I am also bipolar type 2. 

Please, is anybosy out there that can give me support. All i want to do is get high and not habe to feel this way.  I keep dreeaming I'm eating methadone pills.

title says it all. just a bth smoker for almost a year now. have made various attempts to get clean with suboxone but can never get over the hump. so now i got some liquid methadone.

I last smoked at 9 pm (a few hours ago) and I plan on taking 2-3 mg of methadone sometime in the morning tomorrow because, as I understand it, you do not need to worry about going into withdrawal, for you will not go into PWDs when you take methadone. I just wanted to make sure with y'all this is true.

Additionally, the idea is to take a small does of methadone (2-3 mgs) each day for the next few days (I have 13 mls or mgs or whatever). And eventually, I will have gotten through the heroin withdrawals. After that 4-5 days when I am out of methadone, I should be all good right? Riiiiiight?

I guess I just want to learn more about methadone, and whether or not you think this  is a good plan for me to get clean. This has got to be it, and when I take the methadone, since it's so hard to get, I will not be smoking h. I will not need to get well. As far as I'm concerned, the methadone will make me feel 100% normal. Is this true??

Well I am basically wondering what you guys think the likelyhood Id be able to obtain an off label perscription for opiates? Well i guess it would be both on, and off label.



Basically all my life ive suffered mental health issues ranging from treatment resistant depression, severe generalized, and social anxiety, IBS, and last but certainly not least; PTSD.

I do suffer from a level of id honestly say around a 6-7/10 as it doesn't matter if im sitting, standing, walking, or running it feels like my muscles all pull so tightly that it actually becomes painful both in my upper chest muscles, upper, and lower back, and pain which radiates from my lower back into my legs except the pain in my legs feels as though its deep within the bones, and the neck pain can get so bad sometimes that even sitting watching tv is extremely painful, and i have to go lay down in bed. I wake up in agony always taking approximately 30 mins to get out of bed every morning inch by inch. 

On top of the physical pain there is a lot of emotional pain that stems from my early childhood/recent years as the years go by things just seem to get worse..

And then i discovered opiates. My first dose of opiates got me quite high, but admittedly I didn't like the high I was feeling all to much what I noticed that was huge for me was I was no longer in physical or emotional pain.. they've tried countless antidepressants, and addictive benzos to no avail, but the first time I'd ever tried opiates I just immediately knew this is what I should be taking to treat all my conditions as it did the best job of anything I've ever tried.. and for the first time in a long time I was able to make it through a day contently walking the dog, eating, exercising, and overall living a better quality of life.


Because I could never get anything from a doctor stronger than a Tylenol 3 I resorted to sourcing from the street, and was introduced to even stronger drugs that I would probably never had used had one, just one doctor simply listen to me.. I mean sure you go to medical school, but it's me who knows my body best... 


So here I am now fighting an addiction I've obtained because doctors wouldn't help me when I first asked for it.. I've been in 3 car accidents: one roll over the car toppled into a ditch and rolled violently 6 times before coming to a rest on its wheels, one rear end, and one tbone which was on the passenger front quarter panel. In none of these cases did I ever go to a hospital to be checked out to make sure.. the policeman offered to take us to the hospital, but my mother declined so we just went home... at least it would've been documented had we gone, and got checked because I'm almost positive my pain stems from those accidents.


I've seen a chiropractor for the passed 2 years faithfully who said my back was in very bad shape when I came in my legs were about 2 inches difference in length which puts a lot of stress on one side of the back/legs, and the chiropractor managed to adjust me so I was even, but was never able to adjust me so I wasn't in pain. 


I can sit for no longer than 10 minutes before I have to shift about as the pain, and pulling/tearing sensation gets to immense, and it's extremely distracting I don't think there's a time of day where I do not hurt in some way, and yes I know there's a difference between manageable daily pain, and pain that effects your lifestyle.


Well because of the street sourcing I found myself addicted, and when I finally had enough I'd went, and saw a doctor who prescribed me Suboxone.

For the first week or so sure The suboxone worked to stave off dope sickness/allow me to function, but I didn't find it to be effective for my physical or emotional pain as much as a full opiate such as morphine or hydromorphone does. 

It's honestly not even about getting high, and never has been it's been about taking just enough to ease my symptoms to the point of being comfortable, and not thinking constantly ""I wish I weren't in pain and could actually enjoy this movie I rented""

After the week on suboxone I decided to return to street sourcing because the suboxone just isn't working for me, but unfortunately I've been reporting to my doc that it seems to be working alright (and it does keep dope sickness away/may mildly help with pain), but I am still noticing when I do take suboxone I have an intense craving for a full opiate as well as still being in pain so I'm starting to think suboxone just isn't right for me? 


As stated above it's not about getting high, and I'd be more then happy with a doc who gave me even 2-4mg of hydromorphone which is just enough to ease my pain, and allow me to go about my day normally.

Now my question is; what are the chances that if I do talk to my doctor they'd be willing to TRY an opiate based medication.. they say it's just a bandaid, but so are SSRIs as you take those until you pass as well so really this ""that's just a bandaid we want to treat the problem not patch it"" is a bunch of bull because either way it's a band aid.

I honestly really wouldn't care how it's done if he so feels like it he can give them, and write notes on the script allowing only my mother or a sibling who can monitor the dosage to pick the script up, and they could hold onto it, and provide me my dose every 8-12 hours.. 


I am so tired of only having the option of extremely strong opiates like H, and fentanyl.. because they do what I don't want, and that is get me higher then a kite.


I'm at a loss for what to do as I've now I'm sure been labeled in the system as a drug user/seeker, and probably will stand no chance of ever obtaining an opiate prescription which will only keep me sourcing from the street which will only continue to use up my money, and cost me my happiness.


I'm so fed up I sit here in breakdown mode every day wondering what I've ever done to anyone to deserve this without any help from anyone... I feel like if I were to walk into a doctors office, and explain to them what I've explained here they'd laugh in my face, and tell me to get the fuck out..


What is one to do guys..? I'm at my wits end, and am starting to become suicidal because of my pain levels/not receiving any legitimate help, and being told suboxone should be good enough, and we don't want anything else because I'll become addicted again.. frankly I never ever had an issue stopping the opiates UNTIL I moved onto the stronger ones... hydromorphone withdrawal is a walk in the park, and I wouldn't even call them withdrawals as I can stop whenever needed with no I'll effect...

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated... I think I made a mistake by seeing a sub doctor first instead of trying different doctors to see if one would agree to my treatment plan.. I've tried countless SSRIs none of which work, but amazingly a small little yellow pill with the letter D and 4 on either side TAKEN ORALLY keeps me good for 8-10 hours! Besides hydromorphone is less strong then bupeprenorphine, and for me it has less side effects as I do get a noticable buzz/high from the sub whereas the hydro dose is just enough to easy physical, and emotional pain..

Do you guys think I'd have any luck going to a different doctor, and explaining how the suboxone isn't working for me, and trying to obtain a low dose opiate.. and suppose I brought my mother along to vouch for the fact that I do truly need it, and am not drug seeking trying to get high, and that she could be given the medication to dispense to me one at a time as to show them I am serious about my pain treatment.. I'd also be more then happy to piss test for them, and follow anything they said as I'd just be so grateful that someone finally listened to me...


It's hard out here when doctors under prescribe opiates, and especially in the wake of Canada's fentanyl crisis it's even harder now then before, but I'd just found out that a buddy of mine was put on 3 x 9mg hydro a day for his fent addiction!? And he sells them and still uses fentanyl... why is it always the ones who don't need it that get it, but people like me who are in legitimate constant pain are turned away, and turned down...


Im at a loss for what to do, and any advice/suggestions are greatly appeciated, and encouraged..

Six months later I fucked it up and spent a few days getting high. I cut it out, spent a day feeling clammy and weird but didn't have to go through the whole song and dance again. 

Roughly six months after THAT I fucked up yet again. That time I got strung out, used for a few months, got on subs, weened myself down and with the help of some Kratom managed to jump off the subs with no real withdrawal. 

Now it's 8 months later. Here I am back at it but I'm having a weird reaction. I picked up a half gram of ECP even though I'm on the west coast. I've done dope in both places and know the difference, so all you shit lords who want to waive your dope dicks around picking apart people's posts, cool your jets. 

I got real high 2 days ago. It was what it was, both amazing and underwhelming and confusing and all that stuff. The next day (yesterday) I could not stop puking to save my life. I couldn't keep water down, much less food. I made it through the day only doing two very small bumps off my bag. 

Today I'm doing the rest of it because what else am I going to do? It's not like I'm throwing the bag away and I don't want to keep it around to do later. This is my moment and I want to just get it over with. I learned what I wanted to know. 

Anyway, this nausea is a BEAST. I chipped for years before I got strung out and while I'd puke while high then, not the day after. Since going through the Big Kick, in the times I've fucked up I've never had this reaction. 

My question is this: what the fuck is going on with this intense puking? Is it the length of time I've been clean? Is it the strength of the bag? It's really fucking my life up a bit and I don't know what to do to stop it. Does anyone know why I'd be getting this sick to my stomach the day AFTER relapsing?

643thp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/643thp/started_rehab_today/,0,https://redd.it/643thp,Coolcoopdope,Started rehab today,"So as the title suggests, I started outpatient rehab today in hopes of getting better and in hopes of also helping me with court and my two possession tickets. Anyways last week I took a tox screen for my last assessment (3 assessment before being admitted into actual rehab) and it came back positive for morphine and fent! Well here's the thing, I sniffed 4 bags of the stuff the day before the assement (3 at once, the last one about 2 hours after) and I barely felt high! I've snorted and smoked fent powder before and can slightly distinguish the difference between that and regular dope, i.e shorter duration, no sense of the warm blanket wrapped feeling, and less euphoria, at least in my case. But was shocked that the tox screen had actually came back positive. I had seriously thought I got ripped off! Well yesterday I went to a different dboy who text me the day before said he had some good ass fire, So I went through him and being 8 days without a dose did 2 bags immediately and could tell that it was fent! Anyways when I picked up I had copped 15 bags, well I got up today and only had 4 left.. currently 1 left right now (saving for a few hours until I get home) 

I guess my question is, I did 10 bags that ik was cut with fent over the course of 12 hours or So, my friend whose not very tolerant to opiates text me this morning saying he did roughly 6 or 7 bags himself (he knows what fent feels like from a hospital stay he had a year back) and I just read all these crazy posts about fent killing people, especially around my areas right now! And I just can't seem to fathom that I was sniffing a shit ton of dope/fent and not even getting a nod! But by now I'm getting used to the way fent feels haha.. Anyways have a good weekend nodders please be safe! And to anybody in NY please becareful there are lots of OD's happening due to shit being cut with fentanyl! Stay safe! Knock on wood that i havent  OD'd yet and pray I never will. My tolerance is a  fairly good size and my connects have always had good ECP!

However, I believe it is not a case. 

Our 'bliss' is experienced due to a trigger on mu receptors which lead to a cascade of different reactions. The withdrawal is caused by a lack of certain chemicals in certain areas in our brains and other cells in the body. This imbalance slowly goes back to what it was in the beginning. 

So far this description of how opiates work sounds like 'a conservation of energy' but it actually is a conservation of chemicals in certain areas. Therefore, at some point in the future, we will completely understand the mechanism of a 'bliss' and withdrawal. AND then it will mean that we will simply need to 'inject' some 'cure' to restore the balance with no need of waiting for a natural restoration of chemicals aka withdrawal. 

For this reason, the opiate addiction and withdrawal is not like a 1st law of thermodynamics. 

P. S. 'inject' and 'cure' in this post may mean a drug which will induce our brains to instantly restore the balance or it may mean an electric stimuli to 'shake' our system or some sort of implant which detects imbalance at the moment it occurs and slowly releases a drug to stop any further cascade of reactions. Or any other futuristic medicine.",1491601258.0

I've been clean for stretches at a time, like a few months (and I def still thought about it EVERYDAY).

That's such a shitty way to live. Am I really doomed to be obsessed with this shit for THE REST OF MY LIFE because I made a decision once when I was 15? Idk mostly rambling.

Fast forward to the following day, getting there and grabbing mine and my buddies shit. We each bought a bun ($50) and I had also grabbed an extra half bun so between both me and my buddy we grabbed 25 stamps. We go and park in a Rite Aid down the road from where we copped, I immediately sniff 2 bags and my buddy 1. I'd also like to point out I hadn't used in 8 days, my friend for probably 2 weeks or so. Anyways we each sniff our bags, and start talking about some shit for 5 minutes or so before we decide to head back home. Well about 10 minutes after snorting my 2 bags I felt happy and uplifted.. my friend also said he was feeling good. 

Gonna pause the story and give a little insight about the past month and a half with heroin and the law. So back in February, the 18th to be exact, 2 days after my 21st birthday I was arrested for possession of heroin in the 7th degree.. a Class A Misdemeanor. I drove to the the city after work that Saturday afternoon and was planning on copping a bun from a different Dboy than who I went though yesterday, (this dboy has been my go to guy for just under a year) Genuinally has always got me good shit, always about a 7/10 if not better, cost was $60 for a bun. Anyways to make a long story short I got pulled over before I even had time to cop from him, once the officers aporoached my vechile the one officer had veered through the passenger side windows and seen two empty bags in the center council, I was then pulled out of the car and searched, in which they found 12 bags on me in a pill bottle. FUCK!! What the fuck was I doing!? Should've waited to reup the next day cause I obviously didn't need any right at that moment!  Anyways so I go to jail and had  my court hearing Monday morning. I was RoR'd, and court was adjourned until the 13th of this month (April)

Anyways fast forward a couple of weeks or so and on March 9th I was randomly drug tested at work due to suspicions that I was under the influence at work. So I take piss test for work and was then escorted out of the building (I knew I was screwed cause obviously I'm an addict.) Letting me know they would contact me after the results came back... Anyways after leaving the building around 1pm or so I walked a half hour down the road to the gas station, bought some beer and smokes and waited for my ride to pick me up so we could cop. About an hour after sitting outside the gas station drinking and smoking my ride shows up and we head to the city 15 minutes away.. I picked up 3 bundles, 2 from my original guy, and the third was from my dboy who I picked up from yesterday. At this point i wasn't answering my family or girlfriend at the time .. in fact I was telling her I was gonna buy a needle and that I bought 50 bags and was gonna kill myself... So after me and my buddy's get home from copping we had went to the park to play catch. At this point i had already sniffed roughly 6-8 bags and was pretty buzzed from the alcohol. Well after playing catch i went home to find 3 cops outside my house that were called there by my gf at the time for a welfare check.. boom busted again for possession except this time i had 15-20 bags on me.. except I was still only charged with possession in the 7th - Class A Misdemeanor, thank God not with intent to sell which is a felony! 

Since that second possession ticket I've used once a week, for either 1 or 2 days in a row max. No withdrawals, but also no money, no vehicle, and I started rehab to make it look good for court.. which I hope that it really helps me out, So fast forward until yesterday when I had copped 15 bags for myself.. Well throughout the day I had done a total of 10 bags. And behind this whole story was the ideology that I didn't even catch a nod.. scratchy as hell by the end of the night but no nod, I had even mixed in DXM, alcohol, and pot. So I'm quite disappointed as I do believe it's a heroin/fent mix and due to rehab and court it's gonna be hard to use again unless I can find a lapse in time where I know I will have enough time to pass a piss test! 

Anyways thank you all who took the time to read this attrociously long text and i hope you all enjoy your weekend! Happy Nods!

I tried heroin and oxycodone back in July, didn't develop a habit.
Since then I've only used codeine. Now the heroin and oxycodone lingered in my mind for awhile but recently left. I'm a med student and now doing an internship at a doctor's office during one month. Yesterday I saw there's an opened box of oxycodone 5 mg and an opened box of morphine 10 mg in one of the cupboards. Each box contains multiple strips and a few of the strips are already missing some of the pills, so it would be super easy to just pop another pill out without anyone noticing. The name of the patient the boxes belong to is labeled on top of them. Then today I saw a recent passing away card of that same patient hanging on the wall in another room. So a dead man's pills are just sitting there in the cupboard. I'm really tempted. And it's hard to focus on the job when I have those pills in the back of my mind.

I was going crazy : what could possibly be going on.  
  
Thursday night I get a text from her saying that she had been pregnant for the last month and had had a miscarriage 4 days ago.  She said she felt guilty sharing her feelings w me whine carrying another man's child. That she needed time to heal.
  
Due to my meds I've been having a hard problem processing my emotions and understanding how I feel or mostly why I don't feel and how knowing that I'm not feeling makes me feel. It's a bit convoluted but it's the product of a convoluted mind.  
  
Decided to process it the way any selfish and lazy person would (who also can't shoot fent anymore due to the bupe and don't want to go the the hassle of stopping taking the bupe to use) and started drinking and popping my prescribed xanax and kpins and some Ativan I got from a friend.   
 
I was getting hammered and my landlord (I rent a room in a house) was doing his routine drinking Miller lite, smoking J's and watching TV. He calls me over and our conversation moves to drugs. This mofo was an og cholo who's now in his 40s and calmed down.  
  
 I know he does drugs bc therr are days when he's moving at a million miles an hour and frantically cleaning  the already spotless house. He's a real nice guy sometimes and several times has left fat prerolls from the dispensary for me in a bag by my door. At the same time he like doesn't know what like Percocet is or Dilaudid, he just said when he was young his friend had him try heroin and he puked and fell asleep and did the like it (the other resident is a 68yo ex probation officer, 5'7 280lbs who after an on the job injury has been on disability and pain management and gets a shit ton of MSER and now got percs after his knee replacement). Anyway Yayo comes up and he's like yeah I think I have some left from a while ago lemme see. When I come back to the garage from the bathroom he's racked up two fat lines. So I grab my gear pass it thru a filter twice and do a test shot then give myself a nice bell ringer (5/10 stuff).   
  
Tonight hes like come back to the garage and he hands be a little paper ball which in my room find has a lil sac tied up with a .3 solid rock in it. 
  
Ive shot most of it with my bupe as a  (recovery speedball) and it's nice though I've also already eaten 1mg xan 1mg kpin 1mg Ativan and 3 beers. Blow is still 5/10 tho. 
  
So I've been killing myself thinking about what a bs excuse for recovery I've been doing and my depressive mood swings have been tearing me apart. The though of killing myself hasn't left the back of my mind for the last 2 months and has only become amplified over the last month. The news from my girl -- I still don't even know what I feel about it. I cant articulate it. All I want to do is get so fucked up that I feel something. I hate feeling nothing and I want to feel better. But k don't think I'd be even able to maintain some sense of happiness without finding a way to ruin it.
  
I'm lost. I don't know what to feel. I feel stupid for doing the exact things I know make me ultimately feel worse in the end.  And shameful. And guilty. And pathetic and weak.  
   
But right now I feel empty bliss. At least it's something.",1491720779.0

I was around the age of 15, average kid, average grades, nothing special. I lived on a farm had average hick friends, used to love quading, we would steal some beers from the parents, maybe smoke a bit of weed and head out on our quads and screw around – harmless kid fun.  Honestly everyone did it around us and you never heard of anyone getting fucked up.  Well one night my buddy and I had a few drinks, probably more than usual but nothing we hadn’t had before and decided to go out quading.  We hope on his quad to swing by my place and pick mine up, it was dark, no full moon but fuckit we got a light– the last actual memory I remember is pulling my leg over to hop on the quad, then black… Wake up in the hospital, pain is unimaginable and it is morning. Both arms are broke in several places, I can barley move my fingers, and I can’t feel my fucking legs… Shit… Doc comes in explains I’m lucky to be alive. I had Broke both my arms, and had broke my back but they were hoping my legs weren’t a wright off. All I could think about was the fucking pain in my legs.  Long story short the initial managing docs did not really take responsibility of the pain management.  It wasn’t until the pain specialist came around to my bed 2 days later and saw me writhing in pain that I finally had some pain relief.  At the time, I had no clue what he had prescribed me and to be honest I felt no euphoria, warm blanket or any of the good shit – but it was morphine or hydromorph.  Just pain relief, itchy as fuck, and sleepy (really I was nodding out).  A 4 week stay in hospital, a few surgeries, a bit of rehab and I was ready to “walk” out of there. Script written for oxy on discharge was 10mg IR 3 times a day. Go home and for the next 4 weeks live in agony, can’t sleep because of pain, can’t eat because of pain, can’t do anything… At the time I had no clue what oxy was – to be honest, to me, they were about as good as a tick tac. Referred back to the pain specialist, he was a real one, not a pill mill guy, he takes one look at the bottle and looks at me and apologizes - his resident fucked up and prescribed me the wrong dose.  He felt bad, I hadn’t slept in weeks, I was done, I was ready to be put out of my misery  – keep in mind I was about 16 at the time. He looks at me and looks at his pad.  I remember this moment vividly he hesitated went to write on his script, pulled back and then looked at me and you could tell the “fuckit I kinda messed this one up” thought that was going through his head. He goes back to his prescription pad and writes me a prescription for Oxycontin 40mg 3 times and a day and writes my GP essentially telling him to give me an unlimited supply. Now keep in mind I was maybe 130lbs at the time – was about 160 before the accident. Pop an oxy and it was like a miracle.  Finally some relief, I felt good, not euphoric good but much better, another 8 hours later another Oxycontin 40 and I was fucking high.  I remember watching the news and infomercials on TV and felt like it was watching the moon landing but 1000X better.  Still I wouldn’t say this is the point when I became addicted to opiates but It was certainly the pre-game. I actually remember the exact moment I fell in love with the soft/warm blanket of opioids and it was when I went to bed that night and crawled under the covers after taking my 3rd pill.  It is hard to describe the feeling. It was the warm blanket feeling, my insides felt like there was a solution of warmth and perfectness being flushed through it. I. Felt. Perfect. I remember lying in my bed and thinking of my currant physical state. I couldn’t work, I was crippled, I had lost my friends but somehow it was all perfect, it was nice, it was the best fucking moment of my life.  The thought of thinking and imagining how a light bulb worked gave me more pleasure than I had ever felt.  The shear thought that there was energy in the world that could light a bulb gave me the feeling of contentness, perfectness, bliss. This was the moment I became addicted, I didn’t know it at the time but that was the defining moment when the monkey wrapped its tight little hands around my neck, perched its place on my back and whispered in my ear coercing my every thoughts towards opiates.  Now, it might sound like I was headed for a full on junkie transformation .  My life was shit, unbearable pain, and I had unlimited supply to the perfect drug. There are a select few that understand this, although most of you on r/opiates understand.  That last item on the list made everything in the world ok…

Just wondering if any of yall had any experience with this. I've got a small habit and I want out. I just can't deal with the withdrawal or the subsequent sobriety. I've only got a small habit (.1-.2g/day) and have bee using consistently for about 3 months. I know the withdrawals wont be terrible, I'd just rather not deal with it. I've read that ketamine can completely stop them which would be awesome. In terms of staying sober, I've tried to quit a few times before but the depression even after physical symtoms have gone is to much and I always wind up coming back. I've read that ketamine can be a very effective antidepressant which makes me think it could be the perfect solution.

I hope you d00ds are doing well and are not too miserable. I recently had the idea of buying a bulk amount of a good fentalogue, making a large solution and storing it in multi dose vials for ease of use and using that to hold me over until I (hopefully) get into the sub/methadone maintenance program(called ""LARO"" here).

I've thought it over and I actually think that despite them being much more potent, the rapid tolerance increase would probably cause it to be used up way too fast. So actually doing the same thing with actual H would probably be cheaper and safer.

I've made multi dose vials with dissos before, so I know how to do it, but I have a few questions about doing it with #3 heroin.

I can get heroin fairly cheap and it's actually decent. Not god tier, but whatever, I'm not here to brag about my drug connections. Since I can get fairly large amounts for a low price I want to make a bulk solution of #3 and storing it in multi dose vials. This is for a few reasons; 
1. The risk of me accidentally spilling a bunch of powder on the carpet is significantly reduced.
2. Volumetric dosing is more accurate and safer than weighing each dose out and using it that way.
3. It's very convenient and easy to draw up a specific dose since it's already in solution.
4. It will be much easier to keep track of how much I use.
5. Since it's easier to keep track of my usage it will be easier for me to manage to make it last until I get treatment. I am very dedicated to this ""project"" since I REALLY want to get into treatment, but I need this to keep me going until then.

Now - My questions. The ketamine analogues that I made bulk solutions for were pure and uncut. This is most likely (more like definately lol) not the case with the #3 heroin I will be using.  How much of an issue will this be? The methods will most probably be the same as with the ket analogues, with the exception of using ascorbic acid(vitamin c) to help dissolve the heroin. 

Any help, advice, tips and input is very welcome!

I'm up and awake now somewhat, still feeling everything just not as hard..  but I am just a little anxious overthinking things as always.. can you suffer brain damage from nodding out and not breathing at a normal rate sleeping in a weird position? I know when you OD and stop breathing in general that obviously induces cerebral hypoxia.. my dosage I took throughout the hour: 

1mg Xanax, 150mg morphine ER chewed, 30mg Oxycodone.

My tolerance: 2mg Xanax or 20-50mg of Valium in a day, 40-100mg of Oxycodone in a day or 120-160mg of Hydrocodone (Vicodin) in a day. 

I recently started trying morphine because it's around but I don't feel any real oral effects unless I take it with a benzo like 0.5-1mg of Xanax and around 150-200mg of the morphine chewed at a time.,

I didn't leave because I was tempted here I just had grown away from the scene. I do want to say that this community was amazingly accepting. I got clean by taken Sub pills and breaking them in to tiny tiny amounts and only taking when I was being hindered in my daily routine and eventually I just didn't need them. I hated being addicted so bad that I never really looked back. You may think I wasn't bad off but I was addicted for 5 years and shooting H. The daily routine of being an addict just got so tiring. I do not consider myself as a recovering addict or anything related because I believe that in order to lead a new life I can't constantly have  the mindset of an addict. Yes I'm careful to not slip but I have been prescribed opiates 3 months ago. Have taken 2 and still have the bottle in the cabinet. Opiates just aren't what they once were. Maybe I filled my void that opiates filled but I know I love my wife and I want to be the man she deserves. 

I hope this doesn't come across wrong, I understand everyone is different. I just found that for a long time before I got sober everyday I strived to be sober. I hope that those who want it like I did, find what works. Love you all. I don't want to say exactly my field but I graduated recently and work as a medical professional, and I can say that I show way more sympathy for those that I deal with who are addicts than my coworkers. I understand you guys, and I wish people in my field could as well. They act as if addicts are just annoying problems and that mindset will never help.

i was so careful during this detox. i had a small wd kit that consisted of 3 8mg sub strips, 4 xanax (blue footballs), a gram of weed, immodium, benedryl, and an adderal in case i had to work on the 4th day (i have absolutely no energy during detox, even with help). i took my last pieces of sub and xanax on the fifth day, didn't even need to take any of the other meds this time thankfully. i was feeling great on the night of day 5 and into day 6.  I had cracked in the past earlier than the fifth day, so even though it's not much, i was proud of myself. 

on the seventh day, i was hit like a ton of bricks with memories of my ex. he was everywhere. tried to watch tv to take my mind off him but every little thing reminded me of him. tried listening to music- same thing. my feelings of loneliness and abandonment grew and grew. i forgot how strong every emotion feels when you stop using and remember feelings exist and you have a fuck load of them. all of my sadness, anger, confusion, and grief over the loss of our eight year relationship came flooding back after i had tried to numb myself to it all during my last relapse after he dumped me. along with all that overwhelming emotion, something else was just below the surface waiting for the perfect moment of vulnerable desperation to strike.

""*get some dope.*"" it whispered, so softly at first that i expected to easily beat it  back into submission. this time i wasn't giving in. ""*you have been off dope for a week, one bag won't turn you back into a full blown addict. you deserve to feel good after all that you have been through.*"" i smoked some weed which took my mind off everything for a little. the cravings slipped below the surface once again. time was on their side.

later, i went to work and kept receiving compliments from my coworkers. 

""*you look so happy!*""

""*did you do something different with your hair? you look really pretty today.*""

""*you seem different, but in a good way. i'm glad that you aren't as shy as you used to be.*""

""*do you want to get dinner with me?*""

that last one surprised me, for many reasons. 'B' and i had always had a friendly work relationship but as time went by, i realized that i had a crush on him. i definitely didn't have the courage to tell him as my breakup and subsequent relapse had left my self esteem in the gutter. i said yes and felt both nervous and excited for the rest of my shift. before now, i couldn't even think about getting over my ex- let alone go out with someone new. maybe i was finally starting to move on.

when i walked into my room after work, i was still in a good mood. i decided to start cleaning my room because it was in a state of chaos due to my aforementioned problems. i was making progress and everything was going well until i opened a drawer to put something away. right on top was my favorite photograph of us. he had his arms wrapped around me and was kissing my cheek. we both were glowing with the kind of happiness that you only experience a few brief times in your life if you are lucky; the particular kind of happiness that comes with truly falling in love. 

my heart fell into my stomach like it was made of lead. i have never had such a visceral reaction to an object in my life. i was knocked over by a wave of self hatred and the loneliness that had become so familiar these past few weeks. i dropped to the floor as fat, hot tears rolled down my face. i kept whispering prayers, wishes, and my jumbled thoughts to no one. bartering with a god that i don't even believe exists. ""*please kill me. my only request is that it's fast. take my life and let someone more deserving live. i know there are plenty of options; a child with cancer, a refugee being bombed in a war torn country, anyone in need. please.*"" 

as always i receive no sign and my heart continues to beat. i reach for my phone, make the obligatory call, and within an hour i have sufficiently fucked everything up again. i hate how weak and pathetic i am. one fucking picture and i give in to escape the emotional pain. why can't i be strong on my own? why do i love to constantly put myself back into this viscous cycle when i know exactly what the outcome will be? it's not just quitting dope that i need to learn how to deal with- it's life in general. 

luckily the dope makes me forget that i feel anything at all towards any one. i do another line and lay down in front of the tv. 

i hate myself.

A couple of days later, I noticed a nearby pipe had developed a pinhole leak. It reminded me of my little boy peeing a stream, so I HAD to get a pic of it! There is the little pisser, on the left. What does this have to do with opiates, you ask?


Check pic number two, captured milliseconds after pic one. It shows the moment when my pinhole leak went BANG, and exploded all over my new hiding place. You see, I was still organizing, and had not put the shit back into my safe, yet. NOT ONE THING was covered, containerized, Tupperwared, wrapped, baggied, or in a bottle. NOPE.


This pillhead just lost a good  five grand of medicine. It took me two forevers to build that stash, mostly opies, but some benzos and stims as well. I have been up for three days (pretty sure any surviving stims are gone by now) cleaning up the water damage. (Read: on my hands and knees desperately searching for the remains of pills still suitable for human consumption.)


I ask only that you each bow your head in a moment of silent remembrance for my pills gone by(e -bye). 


RIP, OC80s, I loved you most of all.  :(


P.S. Apologies to those who have been looking for me. I was a tad sidetracked by this shit, and will hit you back within a day or two.",1491796409.0

Hi! I've been lurking for a while now, figured I'd make an account and join the conversation.
Got a taste for vicodin, then oxy, after 2 tooth extractions. It made work go by so much more easily. I could actually socialize.
I've been on and off them now for a few months, and I'm moving tomorrow to $VagueWestCoastLargeCity. 
I've only been on them while living in $VagueSouthernSmallTown, and only ever bought from one guy, a close friend.
I'm not here asking for a connect, I actually read the rules. 
What I am hoping for is maybe some advice on finding a new hookup once I get out there. I'm fairly naive in the ways of scoring; I've only ever bought from close friends before regardless of what I was taking out of a fear of getting bad shit. (I got a bad batch of spice early on in my pot smoking days back when I didn't know the difference, felt like I was dying. Never again. Even scarier with people spiking shit with fent, fake pills, all that.)
My tolerance is low, so a couple perc 10's keep me good and happy for a night.
(Yeah yeah APAP, I know, but I can't find OCs or roxis around here to save my life, and I'd be worried about taking too much with my somehow still low tolerance.)
Basically hoping someone can tell me how to find someone selling, and not get fucked over in the process. I've got feelers out through a new coworker who happens to like uppers, which feels really stupid, but seems to be the only lead right now. Luckily, $NewJob is at least beyond tolerant about this shit as long as I'm not nodding at my desk. ",1491794812.0

I've been lurking in this sub for years now, and I've been sort of active lately on this sub under this account because as you can see, I've gotten back into Opiates.

I actually went way too far and was nearly ODing every other day on ridiculously strong NY ECP over a year ago, it was exactly March 9th, 2016 when I took my flight to a few states away from my home to sign myself into a holistic rehabilitation center, where I immediately went into detox and was coming off ""Cold turkey"" from

* 20-25mg+ Alprazolam daily 
* 65mg of Methadone daily
* and of fucking course Heroin; STILL while on methadone daily. 

I stayed clean until I had to get all four of my wisdom teeth extracted, and decided it would be a good idea to accept the Oxycodone 5mg/325 Acetaminophen (by Mallinckrodt) prescription from the surgeon. 

So I would have been a year clean, but I had the wisdoms out sometime around the beginning of February of this year (2017), and decided it would be a good idea to go and buy some H again because I was honestly still in severe pain.

The doctor only prescribed me 18 of those Oxycodone 5mgs, and look where I am now..

**Kind of porn** (This is my fun for tonight) https://anonimage.net/view/XBb08fQ6mK

Doing about 6 bags a day, depending on my money situation. I've been holding up a job as a cashier, and I'm starting to learn how to properly officially run my grandfathers family cleaning business so I can be my own boss. But I'm honestly stuck in a vicious cycle already of spending a majority of my paycheck on dope, then the rest on Xanax which I in turn resell (only the Xanax) and make a hefty profit but I've been blowing it on dope..

I've been doing dope for a few years now on and off but that was the longest clean time I've ever had, and I'm almost 24. The Xanax was once a problem, but after rehab something seemed to really make an imprint in my brain that has been keeping me from falling into an even deeper hole with Xanax again, I have been controlling that very well as I sell a majority of my product now and no longer have much interest in taking Xanax recreationally. But ym custeromr do!!

I think the main reason for this post is because I needed to write some of my thoughts down because I can't tell anyone that I'm back in active addiction again after being sober for nearly a year-- everyone was so happy for me. Well, time for me to slow down on blowing all of my bread on dope and start saving up to pay off that credit card debt and get my newly purchased car registered & insured! 

Oh, and nod the fuck out of course :) It took me a LONG time to write this up and fix so many errors froom

**TLDR;** Addicted to H, Methadone, Xanax, Rehab, Clean for almost a year, back doing Heroin again.

Note: I take around 600mg of codeine phosphate per day for pain management

1. I normally take codeine and it makes me insanely itchy to the point that it is embarrasing in front of my coworkers (i am scratching my face like 4 times per minute now minimum). 
2. Codeine makes me super sleepy, i literally feel like im on the verge of passing out into sleep half the time because the codeine makes me so sleepy.
3. I am unable to concentrate on my work when on the codeine as I'm tired and my thoughts are scattered so I'm forced to take adderall on the codeine or else I'm useless in a work sense. 
4. high doses of hydrocodone make me extremely irritable? Like i took about 150mg of hydrocodone the other day and i was fucking MEAN. I was cussing family members out talkin shit and just being a plain asshole to my folks, really nasty. Today i feel bad about how i was yesterday and wish i would have never been so mean. 



So.. in conclusion... is anyone else starting to notice they don't like who they are when they are on opiates (literally because of the physical effects of opiates)?

I know it sounds ridiculous but today I went to buy my normal half gram I get every day and my normal guy wasn't around. I went to someone else I know but don't mess with regularly. He had this fairly regular looking normal dark tan chunk but it was marbeled with white and when breaking it apart it would crumble around this marbling and realized like half the rock was this shitty white powder. I assumed it was just the cut and did a normal size shot and seriously felt like I was going to die. 

It has been a long time since I did a speedball. Not knowing it was coming and also doing about 2 points instead of fractions of a point like I would normally do with coke, I instantly realized when I  felt the train coming and heard the choo choo in my head and suddenly my heart felt like it was going to explode. I burst into sweat and started puking and my vision went wobbly and blurry. I have never been more scared in my life. I was trying to call 911 on myself but my hands were shaking too badly. I had simply done too much coke and I thought that was it, I was done right then.

At one point, I loved doing speedballs but always in very small controlled doses. I'm older now and don't enjoy them nearly as much but even in my heyday I would have never done this much. I don't know what the point of my story is besides having to get it off my chest. I inject my drugs. And because of that i gotta know what I am putting in my body. This is how you kill people. I could have died. Everyone be safe. And if you in the Cleveland 216/440 area, watch out. Taste test it first. With this batch, if it looks like I described that is the easiest way to tell. I did afterward and my lips went numb like I rubbed them with coke. It's one of those cuts you never actually expect. At first I thought the guy was out of dope or low on dope and just compressed/rerocked some coke into it since coke is much cheaper. But even that doesn't make sense. He could have used powder sugar or any benign powder lying around the house so I don't understand what he was thinking unless he just heard coke has a gnarly rush and did it on purpose not realizing the difference. He's been avoiding my calls since. I probably won't ever find out.",1491788790.0

I have a couple buns left so I'm leaning towards saving them but also, knowing myself, I will probably eat all immediately lol. Not a bad conundrum to be in...",1491763814.0

I wonder if anyone'll be able to help me. So I ran out of vicodin about a week ago and have been going through withdrawal hell ever since. I'm expecting to be picking up some morphine tablets tomorrow, which I plan on plugging. My question is this: if I take loperamide before plugging morphine, will that fuck anything up? I've been having diarrhea ever since the withdrawal started (so plugging will be problematic) but I just want to make sure the loperamide won't affect the rectal absorption of the morphine...

 And are you able to divide the strips into, say 1/8th's (1mg each?) for tapering purposes? maybe even lower than that?

Would the film strips have hot and cold spots like shitty pressed xanax or fentanyl pills? 

I understand the box says ""do not cut or chew etc..""


Any insight into how the film strips are made would be greatly appreciated! 


Hope everyone is feeling well and enjoying this beautiful day! :)",1491753736.0
