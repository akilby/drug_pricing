So, I am reading an article entitled:

Does Long Term Opiate Use Change the Brain - by Medmark Treatment Facilities.

I am really peeved because it seems to me to be a lot of catch phrases and science babble without actually explaining anything. Let's check it out.

neurochemicals - check  opiate receptors - check  long-term use of opiods - check endogenous opiods - check  dopamine - check  serotonin - check  tolerance - check opiod use disorder - check  MAT - check  manageable with treatment - check  can improve with treatment - check

Here is the link for anyone that wants to read it:

[https://medmark.com/does-long-term-opiate-use-change-the-brain/](https://medmark.com/does-long-term-opiate-use-change-the-brain/)

Does anyone really understand exactly what the mechanisms involved in the supposed long term brain changes are, and what this really implies?

To be more specific, what the fuck are people talking about? I do not mean by that, that dopamine levels go down and you are less motivated. I mean exactly what cellular structures are involved, where are they, and what evidence supports this?

I want citations. I want research studies. I want something more than generalized pseudo scientific theories about what the fuck is really going on. If people are saying that this shit damages your brain, I would really really like to understand the reasoning and be able to replicate the thinking. Because I have done this stuff for years, and I feel just fine. Really.

See? I told you I was whiny. I will await your reply.

1. **How does it compare to other brands?** Such as, Actavis, TEVA, Roxicodone, Mallinckrodt, Alovgen, Epic Pharma etc etc etc
2. **How easy are these to fake?** I avoid A215's or ANY Actavis brands now because there are rampant fentanyl or inert counterfeit fakes around that are hard to tell nowadays, its nuts!
3. I am obtaining 10. My tolerance is still low right now, I've just been using kratom before this. **Are these good for oral, snorting etc?** I always use oral on an empty stomach. However, sometimes that's not the luxury that I have when you are hungry.
4. **What is your favorite brand?** my preferred brand of oxycodone has ALWAYS been **Mallinkrodt** and **KVK**.

When the days just drag past and you do your dope, but man, it just seems the same as it was the day before. Then you do your twitter and see what’s going on in the world, but eventually you just can’t get into it. You bring up netflix and you like the show but now it is the 3rd season and you realize, arrghhh, all the episodes are pretty much the same and even if they are not, suddenly you are bored as fuck and it is all bullshit.

Do you wake up in the morning and wish you really were depressed so you could stay in bed all day?

If so, I would say, yep, you need to change your evil ways. Like me, you are posting on Reddit, but what difference does it really make? After all, nobody can see your face. Nobody can really get mad cause even if they do, you can effectively delete them from your universe. And you can’t really connect with anyone because that is not the idea and is against the rules. And you would have to remember all the goddam user names which is impossible.

I am not saying I do not enjoy social media and the other activities. I do, very much. But I also know it is a quick fix and ultimately, imitation life and a waste of time.

So what are you saying, realcat67? 

Goddammit! Could you just, like, get on with it? Quit stalling so you can run your mouth and act like a fucking little prima donna!

Sure. Calm down, bro. It’s not that serous.

I am thinking it is all about the creativity. You know, the stuff that goes out the window when you start getting your kicks artificially? The thing that so freakin many people have complained about on reddit, guys that are musicians or writers or artists or carpenters etc. say they just cannot do anymore without getting high, cause life is just too slow moving and nothing ever happens?

Right?

So, when I was a kid, I made my own magic. I made my own high. I had a few friends and we had our wars and our adventures and we were never bored. We didn’t have any computers so we had to use our neighborhood instead.

Then I got a little older and things were not as magical. So I am maybe 13 and I am more suspicious and anxious now and kids are no longer as friendly. Oh man. Then I hurt myself and the doc gives me an opiate. 

I feel better now. Game on.

But that does not last cause the doc won’t give me anymore. So back to school I go. Kinda boring. But wait, I make a few friends. Not so bad. Time goes by and I get into high school. 

Now me and my buddies are smoking pot and getting into music. Everybody at school loves music, so it is something we can all talk about and not feel like complete freaks. We go to concerts and stuff and have beers and actually have a pretty good time. 

At my school everybody had to do a sport all year long. Plus they really tried to expose you to some kind of art so you would not waste your life entire. It was actually an unusually good school, although it was religion based.

We were pretty much forced to try our hand at playing guitar or clarinet or whatever, and drawing or painting and being a jock in every sport imaginable.

So we did all that stuff but it did not stop us from going to clubs, drinking and snorting coke. But that was only Saturday night. Otherwise we mostly stayed out of any huge kind of trouble. I have to admit I had a lot of fun. At least until I turned eighteen. 

Then I met the wrong people and got serious with opiates. No more sports, no more writing, pretty much just dope. I slide way downhill. Now I live with junkies. I trust nobody and nobody trusts me. I have no money, no family, and I would be bummed if I weren’t high all the time. I am now 26.

Ok, Yoda. Could you move this along? This is really a long post and we have shit to do.

Sure. Not that serous.

I decide to get clean. It happens and now I like the martial arts. I like reading and art. I get a new girl friend, my family likes me again, all is right with the world.

Pretty much works till I am 40. Then I get hurt and fall off the wagon. Rinse and repeat. All that matters is the dope. Fear and loathing in the big apple. Stay that way for a few more years. I feel no pain. I am sedated. Shit gets serous. I am super bored. 

A few years later, get clean again. I am like 65 days in, and am finally through the withdraw. I have energy. I want to talk to people. I want a shiny new girlfriend. I want to compete. I want to play music. I want books. All the stuff that was just too dull and gray is now pretty. The future is looking bright and I have to buy shades. 

So that is what I think. We can play with our dope, and it is fun for a while, but the moral of the story is that life is a game and you can’t really quit and if you don’t find a game for yourself, you definitely aint gonna win. You have to compete. You are hardwired for this. It is in your DNA. If you sit all fucked up on dope, on the sidelines, you will wake up one day when you are sixty and say wtf, why did I do that?

End of story.

Thank fuck for that, realcat67! I was getting ready too….

Dude, please! I told you…

Don’t you say it! Don’t you dare say it, after making me read all this bullshit!

Of course. Anything you want. I want to be your friend and get along with you. 

But it’s not that…

I started calling him around 10 am(ish) and was starting to get worried as my other connects are very wishy-washy ever since I stopped going through them. Anyway, my boy finally hit me back around 8pm and all was good. 

Well, when I finally met up with him after work, I discovered that the reason he was MIA was because his fucking house burnt down that morning. (He actually asked me if I had AAA because his keys were in his house when it burnt down.) Anyway, on my way home I googled what to do in that situation along with a local number for him to call. (I’m pretty sure he only has a shitty burner as he’s had me google shit for him before.) Which felt pretty good!

But then, tonight I brought him a bag with 6 or 7 sweatshirts (some of which were actually pretty expensive and barely worn) with full intentions of bringing him even more tomorrow night when I pick up. Anyway, I feel especially good about myself because I didn’t ask for even ONE bag in return. (Which I know sounds fucking stupid, but we’re all junkies here. So let’s be honest, any small favor is a good enough reason to ask for some extra dope. LOL.) The thought certainly entered my mind, but I figured that dude always takes such good care of me and **never** questions me when I tell him that he accidentally shorted me or some bags were too light and ALWAYS makes it up to me. Even though I’ve only been going to him for about a month. Plus, this guy just lost everything he fucking owns and the absolute last thing I need to do is cut into his only source of income. If he wants to throw me some extras for the clothes at some point when he has enough to do so, then that’s totally his call. But it definitely isn’t something I expect from him or need him to do. Not at all. 

I dunno.  It just feels good to remember that I’m not a heroin driven monster. Now I just hope he actually likes and wears the shit I gave him!",1548999634.0

aly3nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aly3nm/question_from_a_lawyer_about_heroin_weights/,5,https://redd.it/aly3nm,askingopioidquestion,Question from a lawyer about heroin weights,"I asked this question two years ago, and now I'm asking again... I'm a public defender and I testify in my state legislature when the legislators are considering changes to criminal laws. I'm not going to say what state I'm in, but it's in the Northeast and it's a state with pretty widespread heroin use. Some legislators are considering a bill that would, in part, change the penalties for heroin possession - currently we have a weight-based scheme where possession (not sale or even intent to sell) of anything more than 200mg is a felony. The current proposal would move us to a non-weight-based scheme where any possession would be a misdemeanor and any ""possession with intent to sell"" would be a three-year felony. There would still be serious felony penalties (10+ years) for actual sale of huge amounts or trafficking. My testimony isn't going to result in decriminalization or legalization, but for now I'm trying to bend the sentencing scheme closer to something reasonable.

&#x200B;

Legislators are always curious how much heroin is a ""personal use"" quantity. I know there's a huge range depending on the person and on the heroin, but I want to be able to give the committee some individual examples and I won't ask my clients to give me the info because I don't want them to be identifiable (because anyone can look up a list of my clients on the public court calendar) and because I don't want to put any of them in an awkward place - I don't want them to feel pressured to answer me or give me info.

&#x200B;

So. Can you all give me some examples of personal use quantities? How much you use in a day, in a week? How much do you buy at a time for personal use? Also, this is the Northeast, so it's mostly stamp-bags. So if you (like a lot of my clients) have no idea what weight you buy because you just think of it by the bag, tell me how many bags...

I think it may have been a purposeful overdose. I'm not sure. But the way he talked sounded like a human being in mental turmoil.

My parents and friends from school used to take me to see the led zeppelin, the allman brothers (I’m in the deep south), lynard skynard, too many to think about. Prince, ac dc, guns and roses, nirvana everybody played ATL and we were always there.

Michael Jackson is getting ready, within a matter of days, to launch a series of 50 performances in London. This was supposed to be his comeback tour.

There were grave concerns about his health.

""He had a terrible case of the chills, was trembling, rambling and obsessing,"" tour director Kenny Ortega wrote in an email to Randy Phillips, AEG's CEO.

Sound familiar?

Now remember, Michael is 50 years old at this point. The media doesn’t talk about it much, but Michael has now been a junkie since his scalp was burned during the infamous 1984 Pepsi commercial. It looks like this is where he was first introduced to opiates.

Fast forward to 2009. If you have watched the video THIS IS IT, Michael is rehearsing for the show. To me, he looks weak. He looks tired. I know plenty of 50 year old guys who are running 24 hour marathons, jogging every day etc. This is not Mike.

He is such a great dancer that he still looks twice as good as everybody else, but he is only half as good as the MJ we know. He looks thin.

What is the evidence?

It is surprisingly hard to dig up. But there are stories of Michael repeatedly visiting a string of groupie doctors throughout the years from 1984 – 2009. Not really a shocker as many celebrities have done this. But Michael was SO GOOD at hiding his habit. Apparently even Dr. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, and the man blamed for his death, had no real knowledge of his opiate addiction. This guy was supposedly paid 150,000 per month to be Michael’s doctor, yet MJ did not ask him for opiates. Maybe MJ thought all the benzos and the propofol was enough and he should get the good stuff somewhere else.

At some point, MJ wrote a song called morphine. It was supposed to be performed as part of the 1997 hisStory tour, but somehow was cut. Gosh, I wonder why? It eventually came out in a remix after he was dead. Here are a few of the lyrics.

Remember, this was written by Michael Jackson, not a sub.

A hot buzz, baby. He want the buzz, baby. Another drug, baby. You don’t deserve it

Trust in me. Trust in me. Put all your trust in me. You’re doin’ morphine.

You heard what the doctor said?

He got the place, baby. Kicked in the face, baby. He hate your race, baby. You’re not a liar

You’re every lick, baby. Your dog’s a bitch, baby. You make me sick, baby. You talk survival

She never come for me. She never want, baby. I got you up, baby. You’re just a rival.

&#x200B;

Ok, for real, do you think the guy that wrote this was a junkie? Maybe? Yeah?

Of course he was.

Do you think the 120 pound guy that had all the money and drugs a man could ever want, all of which were either opiates, benzos or shit so strong that it was not meant for mortal man, was actually sexually active and getting it on with children?

I think not.

Reports say he had a good bit of pornography stashed around his house. I don’t blame the dude. If I was that chemically locked down and all I could do was dream, dude, I would be looking at those pictures too.

Michael Jackson was so freakin high that he could not even bring himself to have sex with the mother of his children. They did the artificial thing. This guy was so high that even with all of those SUPER hot dancers strutting around constantly, there was never even one rumor of him having slept with a single one. That is how high he was. I have never met a guy that would not have gone there in a heartbeat, yet Michael was like, oh that would be ignorant. No thank you. (Sorry girls, we are pigs, no doubt!)

C'mon, guys! You know what time it is! This guy was not thinkin about sex!

Unless you were like some Nazi white supremacist, everybody else on earth LOVED Michael Jackson. Actually that is unfair to Nazis cause even some of them played their MJ tunes in secret. So pretty much the whole world and who is going to say no to him when he comes by to chat and, oh, by the way bro, can I get a script?

Of course you can! Anything you need, Michael!

So yet another incredible person lost to drugs. Irreplaceable people. Joplin, Hendrix, Cobain, Elvis, Morrison, and those are only a few off the top of my head.

I have been abusing opiates regularly for 5 months and heroin for 4. I purchased the heroin from a reputable DNM; tried different batches from several vendors with a lot of good feedback and then bought a bulk order from the one I thought was the best. 

  


A few weeks ago I decided to cut down and have gradually reduced my dose since then, which has been accompanied by physical withdrawal symptoms (and possibly psychological, but I feel so dreadful all the time anyway that it's hard to tell). 

  


Experiencing withdrawal symptoms has scared me into thinking I ought to nip this in the bud before it takes over my life. I booked an appointment at an addiction treatment centre, which I attended this afternoon. I gave a urine sample and, to my complete surprise, it tested negative for opiates. 

  


So what the hell have I been taking and what am I addicted to?! How could I have gone from the previous batches (which presumably were heroin as they were from different vendors and different countries) to this one and not had any withdrawals, if this current batch is not also heroin? How come, when I nearly accidentally OD’d a few weeks ago, it was exactly the same as when I nearly accidentally OD’d on a different batch a few months ago? Why am I getting withdrawal symptoms when I cut down? What is going on?! 

  


The most upsetting thing is that because they don't know what I'm taking they can't help me stop. Has anyone heard of this happening before? Could the test be wrong, or do I have some incredible heroin substitute that neither I, nor all the other customers on the DNM, could spot? 

  


TL;DR - Received a negative test result for heroin when what I have been taking affects me exactly like heroin and comes from a reputable DNM and vendor. Don't understand, help.

I went to the ER, they gave me some muscle relaxants (flexeril), ibuprofen, steroids for inflammation, and a numbing patch to put on my back. 

Nice and dandy, that stuff helped! I feel much better. 

However, I am one that likes to enjoy opiates for recreation from time to time. They gave me a referral to a pain management doc. I had the idea of when these meds are up, to go to this guy and see if he can gimme some good stuff! I have the fat curve in my back as proof, so I don’t think he can just dismiss me and call me a drug seeking patient. They can scan me all they want! The doc at the RR did mention that they’d most likely do an injection in my back to serve as a nerve block at the beginning. Should I just play along and keep going back every month saying my pain is still present and bad? How do I go about getting some oxys from this guy?

Thanks! ",1548952727.0

For those of you who use opioids and would like to stop; what are the barriers to using methadone or buprenorphine to help quit? Is it the cost? Difficulty accessing? Stigma? Being chained to the treatment drug? Personal preference? Something else?

I’m interested to hear your stories.

For background: Although I do not use, I just started work researching medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder and am interested in learning about users' challenges and experiences with treatment drugs",1548951599.0

It's been a while so here's an update and a question about kratom.,"I'm sure there are not too many people who remember me but I used to be pretty active in this sub. 

May 20, 2018 I had been actively using for the better part of a decade. I reached the darkest hole I'd been to yet and decided it wasn't worth the trouble anymore and attempted suicide by overdose with a nylon noose for back up. I was found after an unknown amount of hours and survived after 2 weeks in ICU lingering between life and death. 

Something changed after that. Although I had struggled for years to get clean I just could not get through withdrawal. While I was on the ventilator in ICU I basically kicked the shit I'd been putting into myself and then woke up and kicked the propofol and fentanyl they'd used to keep me under to heal. 

One month before this episode I had gotten back on methadone as another attempt to get my life together. While in the hospital my mum pondered about telling the doctors about the methadone but eventually decided the risk of methadone withdrawal on top of everything else was likely to push me over the edge or cause more brain damage they were hoping wouldn't happen but was a real possibility.  

After the insital hospital stay I was sent to an dual diagnosis unit of a place that is basically the top metal health and drug use providers in my area. And was staying with my mum by the 3rd weekend in June. 

In these last 8 months I moved back to my apartment, have gone back to college and am currently working on my 2nd semester. I have 2 jobs I adore in my finally realized dream field. I have friends that truly care about me and my family is proud of me again. 

However, I've spent the last 8 months dropping from 40mg of methadone down to 1mg. I decided Monday would be my last dose. I'm a little over 72 hours and I'm struggling with the restlessness, general anxiety, and the lack of energy.

I saw kratom in my local corner store that sells vapes and tons of CBD stuff. My question is what kind of Kratom would I need, would it help, how much to take, what to expect, things like that. 

Thanks for reading if you made it through and thanks to u/dori88 for checking up on me a while back.  This sub was always helpful I just couldn't see the dopeporn anymore.

(even though I was in legit pain, it wasn't THAT bad and I could have just taken ibuprofen, but i didn't bc vicodin is awesome) Now I'm going to the dentist tomorrow to get a permanent filling put on the tooth (the root canal just put on a temporary filling). The root canal doctor specializes in root canals so it seemed standard to get the vicodin script from him, but I am unsure about the dentist tomorrow because it is a family dentist place, and this is a filling and not the ""dreaded root canal"" (even though it is the same troublesome tooth).

My plan is to tell the dentist something like ""My tooth has been operated on 3x this last month and every time I have been in pain afterwards and its been hard to sleep, my tooth is always really sore afterwards, etc.""

Any tips/suggestions?

Thanks!",1548910726.0
allzir,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/allzir/ignorant_suboxone_question/,12,https://redd.it/allzir,kurapikachu64,ignorant suboxone question.,"So I fucked up, and long story short I am now a week or so behind on my prescription of subs for the month. I'll be the first to admit that it was ENTIRELY my fault. I know one person who was able to spare a TINY bit for me (like it was crushed up, I did a finger dip- most likely maybe 2mg). That was yesterday around noon, and now I have 1 8mg tablet left until Monday morning. 

I managed to get my hand on some xanax to help out a bit, and after taking some last night and tonight I'm not feeling too bad having gone since mid-day yesterday on a low dose, so starting tomorrow I have one 8mg sub and a couple xans to get me through four days (Thursday-Sunday... I can get my new script super early Monday morning).

I'm looking for advice on how to handle this in the most comfortable way... and having not ever experienced the full extent of suboxone w/d sickness my biggest question is this: **typically, how long after your last dose of suboxone will the real withdrawals begin?**

Some background for this, I am prescribed 8mg twice a day, and have been doing so for the first couple months. Lately, for specific and somewhat selfish reasons, I've gone down to 8mg once a day (maybe some minor discomfort in this transition). I had kept up the 8mg a day completely until yesterday, when I made due with 2mg. With that being said, how much longer before I start fucking up my work performance because of sickness?

Ideally, I'd like to make it to Friday night/Saturday before taking this sub, basically right in the middle of the 4 days between now and when I get my full script- obviously using a little xanax here and there to help a bit in between. I can break this into two 4mg doses and have two days I can dose, but as long as I don't get too sick to function I prefer to take this tablet in one day as long as I can avoid serious withdrawals during this timeline. I really don't want to go below a 4mg dose even if it spreads things out more, but if you feel this is truly the best course please let me know.

**TL;DR AND SUMMARY: Sorry for the long post, but here is the bottom line: I know suboxone has a much longer half life than most other opiods/partial opiods, so in theory the full fledged withdrawals would take longer to manifest- especially when it's been in my system for a while, right? My main concern (other than making myself feel like shit) is to not be able to function at work.** 

**I basically want to know how long after your last dose (with it having been in your system for months) do I have before it starts getting really noticeable, and is my plan to taper a couple days with xans and taking my sub 2 days before I get my script a viable option?**",1548910648.0

I am a slave to getting high, i need methadone or thos drug will kill me. Im so fucked up that after i was released from hospital, I went to middle man an oz of loud.

The articles keep coming as the bodies keep dropping. Millions getting hurt. Something like a couple hundred dead a day. Literally the fatality equivalent of dozens of mass shootings at once. 9/11 level casualties every couple weeks. 400,000 dead in twenty years. 

**Where is the outrage?**

Friends, sisters, brothers, sons, daughters, parents, relatives, kind strangers...they're dying. Sometimes slowly. Sometimes quickly. Almost always painfully. Constantly, we're refusing to offer help or make simple, effective changes. Victim blaming, misinformation, and fear run rampant. A cult of ignorance, only upstaged by incompetence, leaves countless hurting while society continues to pile the blame on people who are often significantly impacted by circumstance...and more importantly who need our help.

**Where is the compassion?**

People crawling their way out of personal hells, fighting demons from their past lives as well as those of their use find their hands stomped on by an uncaring civilization, lacking in both perspective and heart until those same judgemental members find their own selves caught up in the crisis as someone they love becomes the next to fall. Negative stigmas and shame course through the collective unconscious of society as they struggle to picture the problem. The suffering goes on. It's depressing. It's miserable. It scares me and fills me with a sense of grief and existential dread that I struggle to define. And despite making it out the other side of a long period of time where I could've become one of the statistics, I still feel for the people I see trapped each and every day. I'm not even the one suffering anymore, so why does it still hurt so fuckin bad?

No one knows I'm using, except my dealer. I was clean for almost 12 yrs. Took advantage of pain pills. Moved back to dope this past March after being kicked out of pain management and the street price of pills being too high. I told myself I would stop by May, then a dozen more quit dates after that. All the holidays, my daughter's birthday. I live with my husband, my 2 kids, my sister, her 2 kids, and my husband's sister. Well they all live with us. I'm a stay at home mom so I take care of my sister's kids and my sister in law is disabled and needs help. My sister has had some suspicions, but my husband and his sister have never had a using addict in their lives so they have no idea. We've been together 9 yrs, he thinks I'm ""cured"". My use got up to 1-3gs a day pretty quick. After finally resorting to stealing, and my dealer trying to fuck me I decided to try to kick. Because I'm a coward I told d-boy I would just be out of town for a while. I haven't had any H since Sunday. But I got my hands on 6 25mcg/h and 2 12mcg/h fentanyl patches.

I was given the option of refusing this heart because of the (wrong) information, but I don't discriminate and I fully understand what opioids are, so I accepted the heart. As it turned out, it didn't matter at all.

I reached out to my donor's high school and his place of work on several occasions. I wanted to speak to the high school to celebrate my donor and to talk about being an organ donor. I already do this, so it wasn't going to be amateur hour. I also wanted to speak where he worked to assure everyone that my donor brought life in his passing. He saved three others. No one ever called me back.

Like the pregnant high school student of the 1950's, the stigma surrounding overdose deaths is thick and wide - hidden and not talked about. It makes me angry that this shit causes everyone to hide their head in the sand... like the person who died had never lived.

You will feel much, much better, I promise!","I am really over your drama, Donald. Let's get real. Time to at least decriminalize.  The young guys are not going to stop jacking society to get their dope. It's what they do, man! You should have put them all in the military where they could have gotten a clue, but you didn't. So now our little should be warrior dudes are running around, out of control, fiending and conning. The middle aged and older drug addicts who have actually got it figured out are doing their dark web stuff , which is making the DEA look like the idiots they are.  

BTW I just found out that the UK is actually civilized and they have a much better system. Maybe you should check it out. Oh, and Portugal is way better now, since they did something that made sense about their drug problems. 

See, the thing is that there is actual real data now, and we have these people called scientists who can look at this data and make smart decisions about how things work. 

You really can't blame it on inner city crackheads anymore. You do realize that black and white people actually get along now, right? So that is not gonna fly.  And we do have this thing called the opiate epidemic in case you haven't been paying attention. So it's time to make a move. 

What are the alternatives? Get everybody strung out on methadone and subutex, which are the two drugs that are absolutely the hardest to kick substances ever known to man, and which were basically promoted as being originally safe and not habit forming? God, how many times do we have to hear that one?

Dude, I am telling you. There is still time. Legalize these drugs that are destroying us. Here is what will happen:

1. Cartels go out of business. Insane murdery narco guys start growing tomatoes. Hundreds of thousands of lives are saved. We get to keep our money and have a real economy again.
2. Like magic, HIV and Hep C are no longer a big thing.
3. People no longer have to destroy their lives to get something they want, which in many cases, they only really want it because you tell them they can't have it. See next point.
4. People use all the drugs they want. They end up puking and figuring out much quicker that, damn man, I thought this shit was so great but actually I am kind of tired of using dope now. Think I will quit and take up the saxophone. Drug use goes way down.
5. I could easily continue, but by now you should be figuring it out. I am pretty good at analyzing raw data and I am telling you this is the way to go.

Wise up, man. You could still go down as the greatest president in US history and people would actually LIKE you!

Listen to me and do something smart for once!

So it was the summer of 2016, I was 16, with less than a few worries on my mind and all the time in the world on my hands. I lived with my Grandma, and cousin who was a lot older and I helped her take care of the house and Grandma. Well one quiet night, I noticed a morphine sulfate container that was waiting to be thrown away. My grandma was on Fentanyl patches, Xanax and Hydros. She was in a lot of pain, but even then it was overkill, so inevitably there was some overflow. I didn't care for that other shit, I had heard about fentanyl and bar tards so I was happy to try the unnecessary extra Morphine.

&#x200B;

My first night I waited until everyone went to sleep, I grabbed the sulfate and the oral syringe and took about 10ML (10MG). I was soon feeling the bliss of God's warmth embrace me. Everything was cozy, a bit itchy, and loving. I played games all night, so attached and drawn to the story... I never felt that level of high before, I had smoked plenty of pot, yet the 33% bio-availability from the measly 10MG dose was enough to keep me around. This continued basically all summer, with 3-6 day tolerance breaks whenever I ran out and my Grandma actually needed it.

&#x200B;

That's kinda where my confusion comes in. I was fucking around with liquid heroin, how I didn't get addicted is a myster but I never felt the urge when sober so I don't know. I was scared at one point, that I'd start stealing from her other medicine or taking from her when she's at her worst. Never happened though, after that Summer I kinda forgot about the passtime as school took priority. I still think back to that summer though, the long hours on Minecraft, nodding out at 3AM with my homies... Good times.

I'd always try to help out.

But now, after my experienced with opiates, my eyes were open to the very large amount of addicts who panhandle, con, or scam for their hussle. Even browsing this subreddit some of these thing are reccomended to people as potential hussles.

How long can I use without getting withdrawals ?

Also no point urging me to stop now because addiction, I will stop eventually because the side effects are not compatible at all with my lifestyle even if I like the feeling. I'm a dad (I only do H at work) of a 10 month old dude and I work out 3 times a week, so I need to be able to shit and get some decent sleep at some point. Opiates make my sleep really light even if I go to sleep like 6 hours after my last dose, I can wake up really easily to take care of my boy but I can see it being too tiring at some point.

So yeah...how long do I get before stopping H makes me miserable ?

EDIT : also got 100mg of oxycodone and a box of codeine coming soon from the onion fields, should I keep this to tapper when bag is gone ? Keep in mind I have close to zero self control if I have something, so I'll probably go through all the heroin before I stop. Then it's not a problem to not buy again. ",1548849638.0

So my best friend of 13 years recently died of an OD. He and I have been buying from a dude who sells fent.  He claims it’s h but we all knew it was fent.   My best friend and I texted each other extensively all the time.  Sending pictures to each other of what we get, of our drug use and so on.  Talking about drugs and other stuff.   He lived alone in an apartment. So on the 3rd or 4th of this month he stopped answering my texts. My friends friend lives in the same complex he lived in and spoke to maintenance. Maintenance told him 4 or 5 days later neighbors started complaining about a really bad smell.  Maintenance had to drill out his deadbolt to break in and found him dead on the floor of an overdose. So fast forward to yesterday. A detective contacts me and leaves a voicemail saying he just want to talk, that it’ll just take a couple minutes as it’s about an investigation of which my “name is involved with.”  Mind you, I had nothing to do with his overdose. Today while I was at work, he called me 3 times and I didn’t answer because I was working but this time did not leave a voicemail. An hour or 2 later my wife blows my phone up saying police are at the door and asked what she should do.  I didn’t see it in time so she answered. She told them I was at work.   They left her a post-it with the detectives  name and number.  On the way home he called me again and I just answered.   The convo went like: we are having an investigation about your friend overdosing and his parents want justice and want to put this dude who sold him this stuff in jail.  I informed him I only know his alias and his phone number. Both of which they have. And his phone has been off since like the 5th. (I also know where he lives and his first name but I never mentioned that.) This detective claimed he read all the texts in his phone including his and mine. He wants to meet with me, show me a line up of pictures and wants me to pick him out of a line up and/or tell them what he looks like. I told him I really care about my friend and I’ll consider it.  After the call I was thinking and I don’t think I should and I don’t believe it’s in my best interests to.  This is how I believe it will go down if I do it:  I say “this is him”.  They will arrest him on my word. There will be a trial and I’ll be put on the stand and I’ll have to point at him and say THIS IS THE GUY.   This dude is a scary black dude and his friends are scary black dudes.  I’m worried for my and my wife’s safety and dude knows where I live.   Dude who sold us the fent is a felon and can’t get a job so he’s gotta do what he’s gotta do to make money.  My best friend who OD’d was shooting this mystery powder and apparently overdid and stopped breathing and died. I personally don’t fault the dealer as it was not an intentional homicide.  And my best friend fucked up and over did it. What should I do?   What would you do?   How should I approach it if I decide not to cooperate.  Are there any reproductions for my sudden non-cooperation? Should I just cooperate and tell the detective everything?   Some of my friends are telling me to just shut the fuck up and just invoke the 5th.  Others, including my wife, is telling me I should tell them everything.   I know cops play games and lie and will back me into a fake corner to make me think I’ll have some charges placed on me if I stop cooperating.  I’m just being pulled in multiple different directions and I need lots of advice. ",1548828890.0

About a year ago I moved back to the same place on the Gulf Coast. I was dope sick the first 2-3 weeks and then I fiended for the next 2-3 months. Within that time of 2-3 months of fiending I hit up someone I use to know and hangout with down here when I was in school, Saucier(his name).

We only use to smoke weed so I hit him up for that. He helped me get some bud a few times, one of these times I opened up about the 300mg a day Oxy addiction I had before I moved back down here. He told me that right after high school he started using Oxy and then eventually heroin but had been clean for a while. 

I decided one day to ask if he could help find dope and to my surprise he said yes. At this point he told me he just started getting back into dope(which was a lie, he never stopped) and he knew a person. At first Saucier would take us all the way the way to a city about 40 minutes away to meet J. 

J was someone Saucier knew threw school and used with while I was gone, I didn’t know J, and I was never told his real first name. So I would hit up Saucier to see if we could cop, then he’d call J then call me back. If he was good this is how it would go; I’d pick Saucier up from his house 10 minutes away from mine, then I’d drive the 45 minutes to other city, we’d park at a Taco Bell and wait. It’d take J usually 20 minutes to get there after we’d got there. 

J would eventually pull up and Saucier would go hop in his car for a minute or 2 then get out. He’d goto my window and say “I gotta run inside real quick to grab a drink”. 

*I was naive because this was my first time going through a middle for drug that wasn’t pot. My girl and I at this point had no idea what junkies would do to get their fix because we’d been very lucky to have an 80k inheritance and never (at THAT point) fiended or needed anything we couldnt buy(drugs).*

So he’d get back into the car and we’d head off back home, but not before we had to stop at a gas station so Saucier could fix up in the bathroom. I’d drop him off and get home, empty the bag on the glass/mirror/iPad and start chipping. Pretty weak my girl and I would think but we never over thought it, just figured maybe this batch was weak. 

Well about 9 trips over the next month an a half proves that Saucier was cutting my dope every time he went inside and to “get a drink”. Eventually I stopped hitting him up altogether and he did the same, id make statements about the cut in the heroin or how it never weighed the same and he’d shrug it off. I’m assuming he also realized I figured out his game because he’d avoid talking about the dope when I’d mention how weak it was or that it was mostly cut. 

About 3 months past and I was maintaining with *censored* to keep WDs away. Well I was scrolling through my phones pictures and I remembered that Saucier used my phone to take a pic of another plugs number once a really long time ago, but it was another dealer, one we’d only been through maybe twice. 

I find the number and text it, they text back and I ask if it’s O, he said yes. I felt so relieved but yet still so close away. I explained who I was and how I know him through Saucier. 

Out of no where the plug tells me he’s been looking for Saucier and that he ran off with a G(200$ in this area) of dope and never payed him back. Apparently Saucier told him that he went to jail and that’s why he couldn’t pay him, that was false because I have friends of friends that hangout with him and he was working the past 5 months and he’d just been going through J. 

I tell O that Saucier had fucked me over and blamed it on him for the weight and being weak. O tells me if I give him Saucier’s number and address he’ll make it right with me. I meet up with him in person and give him Saucier’s info, his girls info and where he stays. The plug smiles real big and hands me a sack gets out of my car and gets back in his and drives off. 

I get home and dump it out on my scale and it’s 2.3gs, I nearly started crying. I did a few bumps with my girl and I was gonnnne. Bag lasted us about a week in total and still to this day the best dope I’ve had. 

Well that transaction with O about Saucier took place around 2 months ago and today I get a text from Saucier. It simply said “you ain’t give my address out to no body rite”, I said no and asked why, he tells me someone came to his uncles house (where he lives) and told his uncle about the money Saucier owes a “dealer” and that his uncle kicked him out about doing dope and not knowing till now. Saucier is now homeless living near some train tracks downtown.


The best part is, I just helped him get dope from O, except I picked it up by myself because I have my “own” dealer now and he doesn’t take new people(the reason saucier wouldn’t give out Plugs numbers which is a lie) lol, he has no idea I’m going to O. I charge him 35(what he told me points go for when he was ripping me off) a point and I’m only paying 20, it’s also cut to shit, but the games the game right?

TL:DR    -shitty middle use to fuck me over, I had a chance for revenge and free dope, took the revenge and free dope and now I’m in his position and he comes to me for dope. He’s also homeless for fucking over a plug and me.",1548812631.0

I kind of liked it. I went to high school in the late 80s, way before the internet. I did not go hard core addict until I was 18, so there was some time in there when I had actual friends. We would hang out, go down to the woods to smoke weed and cigarettes and complain about how outrageous it was that adults did not properly respect us and to make fun of them and their ignorant ways. I got good grades with no effort. I enjoyed sports. I liked the girls and the girls liked me.  There were NO video games to speak of. Everybody was in a band or did at least one sport or was in a club, like physics or chemistry.

On the flip side, I had to sit through boring classes that I simply was not into. My teachers tried their best to liven them up but William Faulkner in high school? Not possible. Every once in a while, we would luck out with someone really good. I still remember Mr. Macintosh, who was with the 101st Airborne in the 60's and would wear his fatigue jacket with his paratroop insignia to class. A Screamin Eagle. He was cool, but not someone to put up with nonsense from the boys. It was yes sir, no sir. He was a big dude and no fool.

Things started to get funky in the 11th grade. I actually had a PE teacher named Mr. Limbaugh who had the thankless task of doing drug education. We sat in slack jawed amazement as he would preach the evil addictive properties of weed. Right after class, we would all run off to get high. It was all about Prince, Madonna, The Eurythmics and Michael Jackson. We were all big city kids and on weekends we would go downtown to clubs and use our fake IDs to drink and try to score some cocaine.

When I was eighteen, a female friend met a guy who was an ex-marine. He was 26 and he was a junkie. I remember going over to his house one day and seeing him dopesick. The next day, I took some of grandma's Percocet to him. A few months later, I was shooting dope. I could not believe how much I liked it. I think I got nauseous the very first time. After that, it was game on. It did not take long for my old friends to see how I was getting sketchy. I started to isolate myself. I had to come up with money for my new habit. My friends were like - ok, we see what's goin on. They might snort a little coke or do a hit of acid once in a great while, but there was no way they were gonna get involved with heroin.  So we went our separate ways. I soon learned how to go downtown and cop.

I somehow made it to college. That was a crazy time. But I would like to hear if high school made you into the man or woman you are today, or whether it messed up your world.",1548806450.0

Anyways call me a pussy, but I don't like violence. That scene actually disturbed me and troubled me when I seen it, because the thought crossed my mind that though shit like that is dramatized even glorified on TV, music and movies, it's kind of horrifying to realize that that kind of shit goes down in real life on a regular basis, like at this very moment someone is probably getting jacked, raped, tortured, and murdered, how cheap the value of human life can be is tragic.

I'd like to hear some real stories, what kind of stuff have you guys witnessed, or heard of happening (like first-hand, not through a friend of a friend of a friend). I think a lot of us are insulated, and we don't all see the dark side of the drug world. Like it is troubling to me that the crack I've smoked probably got here tainted with someone's blood, not literally but surely people are always dying in Central and South America and the ghettos of the US over this white powder. We can argue the cause of that (I believe legalization would solve most of these problems), I don't believe drug users bear the responsibility for much of this international and drug trade related violence, but regardless, sometimes it is good to recognize what goes on around the drug trade. To be aware of this kind of stuff, might help people to understand that the best option will be to legalize and regulate.

So whether it be the lows sunk to by certain users, or violence related to drug dealing, what is the memory you have that will forever be seared into your mind?",1548805466.0

Nothing is wrong at all.”  Here’s the twist, I have 2 herniated discs in my neck for an absolute fact. I just got a MRI a month ago that showed my herniated discs. Talk about malpractice. Has the “Opioid Epidemic” gotten so  inflated that doctors and nurses are flat out lying to patients now? 


Oh well, I’m just headed home to rest. Thanks for all of your answers. Really appreciate it guys. Stay safe opifam🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤


(Original Post)
So I was just in a wreck like 10 mins ago. I refused ambulance at the scene because I had just picked up some 15s and had done 3 of them. For me, that’s not enough to “fuck me up”. It was totally their fault and the cop agreed it was their fault. My question is, should I go to the hospital or will they test my blood and see I was “under the influence”?


I already have a fucked up neck and back. I just cannot afford to have them blame it on me just because of Oxy.

It's a good day for me, sold my car the other day and only asked $500 because it wasn't running and I needed it gone cause I'm moving. Got lucky and the first guy to look at it agreed. When the buyer (middle age, white male, pulled up in a very nice luxury car) came back with the tow truck asked if I wanted a little hash oil and when I said sure he handed me a paper shopping bag. I opened it up and saw that he had handed me a stack of big slabs of oil between parchment paper. I was in total disbelief and when he said it was a quarter pound of oil I realized i misunderstood and went to hand it back to him and said something like ""yeah looks nice I'd love bowl or two"". But he said no thats for you and I was in total disbelief. I've seen ALOT  of weed and ALOT of oil in my life and blew my own bho fot years when I was a teenager but I had STI never seen so much oil in one piece. I don't smoke or weed lately but everyone I know does so im confident I can sell/trade/give it away really easy, especially because it was a totally unexpected gift on top of the amount of money I wanted for the car. So I can sell it insanely cheap and not feel bad because its extra. It was packaged kinda haphazard and anyone that's dealt with this shit knows it can be a sticky pain in the ass mess reallllllllllllllly fast. So I've been spending the last couple hours collecting it in on thick compact puddle so I could weigh it and then spread it back onto new parchment paper nicely. Just finally got it weighed out and after giving away a bunch and trading a little for white I'm still left with 66 grams! Nice little come up. So I'm just waiting to hear back from a guy about getting it sold ""first thing this morning"" so I can go get myself (hopefully) half o. Hope it goes well and hope y'all have any easy hustle to work today so we can all get nice n loaded and enjoy ourselves on this shitty January Tuesday.

If you want to read about some asshole cops, here you go. 

So a few months ago my fiance spent 6 days in the emergency room due to some respiratory issues. This trip being the 6th time in less than a year that we had to visit the ER (a few times for her or I going, a few times for other family members). Well now we're back again because a cop gave her a concussion. 

Story time! We were in a car accident a few months ago, totalling our car. After trying to sell it as is, or sell parts off of it for the last month or so, the ""Neighborhood Service Officer"" finally called a tow truck for it (because it wasn't registered). Well while the tow truck was on the way the ""officer"" said we could get whatever we needed out of the car (not sure about anywhere else, but local laws allow you to get anything out or off of the vehicle until the tow truck is attached to your car). We started taking shit out of the trunk because it was basically a storage unit because we don't have space in our house. 

Tow truck arrives, isn't hooked up yet, and my dad starts arguing with him, so the police show up. The cops are fucking ***heated*** the minute they show up. They're throwing shit back in the car, yelling back and forth with my dad, and while my fiance is reaching in the trunk to grab a box one yells ""So now you're trying to climb in the vehicle!?"". She explained she was just grabbing something, and when she reached for it a second time she was grabbed from behind and yanked away from the car. When she was grabbed she wasn't able to hold the trunk lid open anymore so it slammed into the back of her head, then another officer grabs her, too, and tries to pin her against the car behind ours to get her hands behind her back. 

All of this happened less than 10 minutes after she asked an officer not to stand so close behind her because she has PTSD. She falls to the ground in a state of panic, lays down in a pile of snow next to the other car and just starts bawling and hyperventilating (my brother was inside and said she was crying so loud he heard it over his headphones), and while I was trying to talk to her and help her calm down there were officers screaming at us to get out of the street. I told them to call an ambulance, I think my exact words were ""she can't fucking move because of the panic attack *you* caused, she doesn't need to get out of the street she needs an ambulance you dumb fuck"". 

So we're about a week out from the incident and she's had a feeling of nausea constantly. She decided she wanted to go to the ER and get checked out, both to make sure there's no problems and to have medical history after the injury so we can put together a stronger case when we sue the police department.

So I get to spend another night in the hospital sick. Luckily we were able to stop by a friend's place and she was able to smoke some black (we hate smoking, usually doesn't do the trick for us). I'll voluntarily be sick so that she doesn't have to, especially if she's gonna be in the hospital. ",1548754227.0

I’m getting the point where when I wake up in the morning after about not using for 8 hours( I’ll do a 10-15mg dose before bed) and  I’m in unbearable withdrawals. I’ve never experienced anything like this. I’ve kicked dope years ago no problem but never had something so intense as Opana. I’d say my biggest issue this go around is I have a very good job that I make enough money to support my habit no problem. However I need some tips on how to taper off. I’ve thought about stopping opana and picking up a dope habit for around 30 days because I know dope was much easier to kick in the past, think this would be a good idea or just make it worse? . I also have around 15 8mg suboxone strips so I can ease withdrawals with them and eventually do a taper with the subs as sub withdrawal isn’t that bad. I was on subs for 12mg /day of subs for 1 year and tapered to a small dose and WDs were honestly a breeze. But I can't even think of getting to 48 hours off the Opana to be able to start the subs bc I’m afraid if I wait 24 hours and start taking subs  I’ll go into precipitated WDs which I’ve never experienced but have heard horror stories. Guys I need help. How long should I wait to have clean off Opana until I can start takin the subs. The WDs are just unbearable and don’t know what to do. ",1548752003.0

Working close to 40 hrs a week, this has allowed me to spend almost all my money on dope for the past four years now. The thing is though is that I've grown really tired of my dead end pizza delivery job and also have been having a lot of issues with my car lately which has costed my parents more money than they can really afford and this has left me feeling like a big financial burden on them and also guilty because I know that I really should have the money to pay for the repairs myself if it wasn't for my addiction. 
So I'm at the point where enough is enough. I'm ready for change. The high honestly isn't even that great anymore, I really have just been using to stay well so I can work and also admittedly just plain bordem. But like I said, I'm through with it. I want to have a real life before it's too late. Like a friend told me a long time ago, you create a life and get high in it, but you don't create your life around getting high.
So after I pick up my car from the shop tomorrow, I'm going over to my mom's and coming clean. She's knows that I've dabbled with opiates in the past but doesn't  really know how deep I've actually gotten myself into it. I'm pretty positive that she'll respect my decision and honesty in coming clean to her.
All that I have right now in my w/d arsenal are some Cotton's, one sub and also some trazadone. I'm hoping I'll be able to get some kratom and maybe some benzos soon also. Im deffinatly going to wait at least 36-48 hrs before I take any of that though. I know how w/ds go, I've been through atleaste a few times in the past but I was never able to go more than a couple weeks clean. The difference this time though is that I'm doing this because I want to, not because I have to like in the past.
I know I maybe should've posted this in r/recovery because I know how some of you guys hate reading about getting clean. I know I do, I usually just skip right past w/d / sobriety posts, but I'm just hoping maybe one person will relate to this and maybe help them get clean too. Like the person a few posts below me talking about the fascinating aspects of w/d. Im about to be right there with you buddy. 
                            I GOT THIS!

Edit: thanks for all the feedback guys. I just talked to my work a little bit ago, basically lied to them and told them that the repairs for the car are real expensive and my rents don't have the money right now, even though it actually should be ready within the next hour or two. This situation is pretty much leaving me completely broke though, so it's not like I can grab even if I wanted to. Just have enough to hit Wawa and gear up on water n stuff. This sub really is amazing, the support u guys have given me is helping me a lot mentality. I just hit 12 hrs and im actually not in nearly as bad a state as I have been in the past by this point.

He was nice enough to take us to cash our checks, as that was just another thing i would have had to do on foot before i embarked on his unholy journey. So now we get home, its 25° out so bundling up is necessary.  I have on 2 long sleeves, 2 hoodies and 1 carhart jacket. 2 pairs of socks, 1 pair of leggings and 1 pair of sweatpants. I hug and kiss my kids goodnight and I'm out the door. Its fucking freezing to say the least. Of course the bus is 30 minutes late. My hands and toes are already hurting. But I continue on. I'm now on the bus headed to a bigger city, which is home to I hear what is the 2nd largest open air market. It is insanely hot this time of night, strike force is out in full force.

Anyway I would always help out his girlfriend all the time when I would get pills from the onion and she's good shit. Nice girl. She would do the same when she picked up pills and hooked me up as well. 

I was in a bind and she said she could get me some 20mg pills so I gave her 400 not thinking anything of it. Until she stopped replying and just took my money I'm assuming. I'm seeing her snapchat stories and she's out with her boyfriend (my old good friend) at expensive restaurants. Keep in mind she is a waitress and he is unemployed. Plus they just had a kid like a year ago and they are living with her parents who are also oxy junkies. 

Yeah yeah I know don't let my money walk, but with how many times I helped her out and she helped me out I really thought she was gunna pull through. Guess not. Money isn't really a big issue for me since I make good money at work, my issue was being sick while at work which I was today but I think tomorrow I'll be all good since it's been about 5 days since my last dose of heroin. 

What would you folk do in this situation. I'm not an agressive person, and I don't want to do anything to effect their kid, because he already has problems and a shitty life already and I really hope they pull their shit together to provide a good life for that sweet little boy.

Last Saturday, I overdosed and was found on my bathroom floor dead by my newly announced fiancé.    My fiancé has very little knowledge of drug addiction and has never once had to expierence it herself.   For months I was hiding the fact that I was shooting heroin.   We currently live in separate houses and when I went inside to change one day before we were to go sledding.  I quickly fixed up a shot and proceeded to get high before we went out.  Little did I know, this was going to be my last shot for a long time.    I did my thing, shot up about .4 of some good quality dope, nothing unordinary for me, something I did multiple times a day.   I shot up, capped my rig, cleaned up my desk, and the next thing you know I’m being shaken slapped and being brought back to life.  My fiancé is standing over me frantically, screaming what happened, what’s wrong, what did you do, tears flying from her eyes.     I had locked all the doors in my house l, after not coming outside for 30 minutes, she realized something was wrong.   Thank god my front door is made of glass, she called a friend and he told her he needed to get in!   My fiancé found a broom outside and proceeded to break my front door and get into the house.   After calling the cops of course.   


So my secret was out, I told her everything.  I told her about my addiction and how I needed help.   I told her I would do anything I’m truly sick of feeling like I want to die everyday.   I got myself checked into a detox, and suprisingly, the withdraws were not that bad.    I knew I was done, I just want a new life.    I’m checked into a rehab, I’m checked in with a therapist, and I’m working on getting on suboxone or vivitrol.  

But I can’t shake this feeling, am I dead?   Am I still just stuck in purgatory to only see the faces of all the people who I have pained during my addiction?  If I go through the 12 steps, when I’m done, will I directly be transported to hell where I belong?  Is my fiancé the same sweet girl who I asked to marry me just 20 days ago, or is she another version and I’m in a different dimension and the one I’ve spent the last year of my life with is mourning my death completely crushed .... and I’m just here.   I have nothing but anxiety and fear... I really think I’m actually dead.  


Tl;dr
I’m dead.  My life isn’t going to be anything.   I’m going to lose everything that makes me happy.  No matter how much I surrender and do everything to stay sober and happy. ",1548721363.0

I have been on and off heroin a number of times, and have kicked the same number of times.

One thing I wonder is - what motivates someone to pull the trigger and actually do it?

Pain, fear, despair, maybe just being sick and tired of the ball and chain? All of the above?

A couple of times I got locked up, then it was not my decision, and I ended up using again immediately after I got out. This was mostly when I was a teenager or early twenties. Later in life, something usually happened to make me decide, oh hell no! I am done! Those were messed up times because I was completely determined to get off the dope, but the problem was that the monster was coming and I was scared.

I never wanted to face that. Sorry, but that was next level badass and I was not, could not, be that brave.

Typically, I would try to taper for a little while, look for some way to avoid the kick, check out sleeping pills and so forth. I would literally do almost anything to avoid having to do it, but in the end it had to happen. When I started the first 24 hours, I knew that it was game on. I knew it was going to be a terrible grind for at least 5 days and knew that I would be disabled for at least 2 weeks after that. No need to babble about it, you all know what it is like.

But the weirdest thing to me - and I've had other friends who reacted the same way - once I started the detox, there was no way I was taking an opiate. I had no craving for them. I usually had a liberal supply around just in case, but I never remember taking any. I was literally too sick to want to get high and to desperate to blow it once I had started.

Now it is just so interesting to me to wonder why it is so hard for some people and it seems like it is not that bad for others. Some people do a 3 day taper and they are fine. Some people do 5 days and they are fine. Some people spend weeks or months tapering, then try to quit and are fine. But some people, mostly methadone or subs, try tapering and it just does not work. For whatever reason, the detox is too brutal and they decide to stay on opiates at some level.

What's the difference?

And why do some people succeed, where others simply cannot make it.

What I am pretty sure it is not:

It's not cause you are a raging dope fiend or a hopeless addict, because I have known really good people that just have immense problems quitting, no matter how much they desire it.

It's not cause you have no willpower. I have known huge over-achievers who could run me into the ground, yet still had problems with the kick.

It's not cause people are cowards, cause I have seem some real no-shit badass mfs just crumble under the weight of the wd.

So what is it? What crazy drive allows somebody to endure that level of horror?

I don't know. I don't even know for myself. I certainly am not the strongest, bravest, smartest, most well behaved, most honest or most ethical guy. But somehow, I seem to have a high pain tolerance.

Other people, I have no idea. I would love to know what you think.

Nixon declared a war on drugs in 1971. We all know that the government believes drugs and addicts to be a menace to society. Despite the current “efforts” to curb opiate addiction, addicts have long been thought to be low on the totem pole. Obviously the war on drugs can’t be won, or their previous tactics haven’t worked. 

What better way to eradicate a “menace to society” but than to kill off the people who in their minds fuel it, the addicts. No more demand for product, no more dealers, it’s a win, win.

Enter Fentanyl. It has been found in every class of drugs. Why? Why would a pill presser make fake xan bars with fent... it makes no sense.

I dabbled with most drugs but never really fell prey to addiction with maybe an exception being tilidin which i can rather regularly get from a friend. I don't want to keep freeloading though and thought about buying something off the darknet. Not taking opiates is obviously better for you but will this inevitably fuck up my life completely at some point?

Edit: Thank you guys so much for sharing your experiences. Reading some stories of actual users and addicts (no offense, really) is way more helpful than the shit spread by media and people who don't think alcohol is a drug. I'm gonna pass on ordering opiates for now so thanks for potentially saving my life. You've been more helpful than every straight-edge fucker on his high horse. Stay safe, people.

‘It's better than just depressed I suppose’


“Fuck I should have followed him” I say to the shadow people, hiding behind the closet door.


I lay on my bed staring at the blank ceiling, taking hits from a splif. Waiting for the warmth of a high to grace me with it's presence after a long days work.  


Brookes things added a little flair to the previously Spartan room, books adorned the shelves, shells, and a weird rock found at the beach also became part of the decor. Last but annoyingly not least was one cat she had decided to bring with her Jimmy. He sat somewhere in the shadows watching every curl of smoke rise from my lips, diligently waiting for Brooke to return. 


Running situations back and forth in my head I found every tiny failure. Everything that had resulted in Brookes now bruised nose.


I know I should have followed him, but after the beating I got, I thought it was over. If only I had, this wouldn't be happening. The tears, the arguments, the vented anger stifled the whole apartment. It permeated the walls like the stench of blunts Adin and I smoked chronically.


Dreading the inevitable I go through the experience again. 

><=><=><=><=><=><=><


Brooke had decided she wanted to move in, and being young, dumb, and full of cum. I  said yes without a hesitation. 


She had packed everything she wanted, cat included, and Lucas and Mira had agreed to help us move her out of her parents.


We had decided on a Friday afternoon, when everyone should have been gone… But when we parked all the cars were home and we knew it wasn't gonna be a good time. After 5 minutes of shouting Brookes mom asked if the past 6 months we had just spent high and having sex. With nothing to lose that I could see, I said “Yup”, no half assed apologies just truth. Brooks mother stared in disbelief,  as I stood up to start moving boxes.


Her father wasn't in the living room thankfully, he was short, but he was a wall of muscle and testosterone. I made trips to and from brookes room to the front door, since Lucas and Mira were barred from the house. All of a sudden out of nowhere Chris, Brookes father appeared in front of me on the stairs yelling. I dropped the boxes as I evaded his first throw at me.


Growing up with Mik my best friend in California. At 18 we started fighting each other every Saturday, Fight club style, in an abandoned neighborhood development. So a beating and taking punches is something I could handle.


The thing Mik never was able to do was pick me up and throw me into the wall. Exactly how Chris just had.


‘Oh god, thats a stud’ I think, as I floundered in gasping agony.


Chris continued to hold my collar and threaten me within an inch of my life. I considered it to be better than being hulk smashed into the wall again. After a minute he left toward Brookes room, I muttered “oh shit”. I ran the boxes to Lucas and ran back to Brookes room. Brooke was crying, her nose was bruised. Right then and there I wanted to kill Chris. 


I was outside ready to call the cops when Brooke bolted out the door.The last of the boxes were smashed into cars, and we peeled out. With Jimmy on her lap Brookes sobbed. I was venting to my mother on the drive to stop at Miras. We calmed down there, soon there was no more hysterics or punching things, just peace and friendship.


I wanted drugs though, I had a bit if weed in the car and some Xanax at my apartment, but behind the mask I knew what I wanted. I wanted to be high. I wish I hadn't poured the last of Brookes Oxy syrup into a Pepsi…


‘Soon’ I hope.


Brooke, Lucas, Mira, Val and I unloaded the car that afternoon and partied all night. I slipped upstairs twice to snort or parachute .25mg of Xanax. Life was ok, I was in a safe place, surrounded by my friends, and I was on a comfortable combo of drugs.

><=><=><=><=><=><=><


But today, today Brooke was somewhere, and I was alone before Adin came home. As the high washed over me I wonder about my substance use. 


‘Do I always use too much?’ 


‘Nah, nah, I can stop whenever I want’ I muse.


Coursing through me is .5mg of Alprazolam, real bars from my friend Jeff, not the pressed colored ones. Along with this was two shots Bacardi with pineapple juice, and all the cannabinoids I could handle, before my splif was all tobacco. 


‘I need to be high, just a break, I can't stand the constant talk’  


I put in my headphones gingerly as my body aches. Where Is My Mind plays and I let my mind drift into the ether, just a little break...",1548664437.0

Started taking roxys a few years ago and it helped my back pain and i continued use more and more frequently, and got addicted, using from morning until i passed the fuck out, waking up just to redose. Went to rehab last June, was put on a methadone taper and finished my 28 days. 
I managed to stay sober a few weeks, but since I’ve been out of rehab I still enjoy some roxys or dillies here and there, and they are the only thing that seems to help my back pain.

Have a subutec lined up, waiting for a “come on” text any minute. Took some Baclofin around 5 and a half of a Xanax around noon, also been smoking plenty of weed, so I guess I could be feeling worse. 
Sorry for the rant , nowhere else to vent to :/",1548636417.0

Been off dope for almost 2 months now, on a low dose of suboxone(0.5mg morning and night so 1mg a day total). Well i was bored browsing craigslist as i usually do, although i never follow through. Saw a post about 30s so i texted number and he said he was out so I just shrugged it off and he texts me “opana?” and sends me a pic of a G74! I fricking shat myself and asked how much and jumped in my car and drove over. They were 60 a pop which i feel is cheap? Idk, anyways, i have a pic if anyones interested, I ended up copping 2. Think im going to try some now, even though i took 0.5mg of subs like 7-8 hours ago, ill update how it is! Hopefuly I can break through, goddamn I'm so excited I never thought i'd actually find these! and now i got a plug for them.

EDIT: so like I said, never tried oxymorph before and it's been over 2 years since I really messed with pills. So I removed the time release coating(never had a pill I could do that with before haha) and took a half pill and crushed it up. I divided it into 3 lines and sniffed 1 line. What from I gather, 40 mg of oxymorph is around 240mg of oxy(snorted), so I snorted 1/3 of half a pill, which should be about 40 mg of oxy insufflated roughly. Have no idea what my tolerance is since Ive been on subs for a while and on a low dose. Not expecting much since i took a half mg of sub today, but i honestly couldnt wait. going to see if this 1 line hits me and if not take another

EDIT TWO: well, I just took my last line. So in total I put half of a panda up my nose, so 20mg.  well actualy, I lost a few MGs because I'm an idiot and dropped some like a fricking idiot https://imgur.com/a/vf8xN5a (dont click if your sensitive to lost drugs T_T ) . I'm feeling pretty goood but definitely not nodding or super high, but that's to be expected since I've been on subs. we'll see how i feel in 45 minutes or so.  I'll save the other 1 and a half pandas I have and try another half tomorrow and see how that goes. ",1548635991.0

something's going on right now with me, specifically, and if not the city i live in, at least the particular handful of dboys i use regularly enough and even a couple ill fated or mediocre cold-cops. the same thing happened last year for a spell, and it's driven me absolutely crazy both times, though all in all it could be much worse, still.

basically, it feels like every person i cop from has had some variation of the same shitty, ineffective, borderline bunk dope - a couple have told me 'this is that fire from ____ before' and it'll look exactly like the last batch i got from them, which was some of the best i'd had in months - but got absolutely nothing from it beyond a very, very basic 'not quite sick' level of stasis, and even then i still felt mostly like (mild) shit - no horrible W/D, could sleep hours at a time, etc - but couldn't sleep well or fully, felt just generally 'bad', emotionally & physically, like when the first WD signs are creeping in.

the guy who sold that has been my main a long time - for good reason - and when i told him it wasn't doing it for me, he took it back & promised he'd replace it with something better, like the last stuff before it. he made true on his word, and said 'now i KNOW for a fact this shit will be right for you' - as you can guess, it was not. same stuff, just different seeming cut. both had a particular ""weird taste/smell"" i can't explain that an almost identical feeling (but not looking) batch had 2 years ago in 2017 - i remembered it well.

to wrap this up before i go on too long (sorry) - my other most reliable connect has his phone off (for the first time ever, and for two days straight now - not a good sign at all... hope he's ok) - tried a few other people i've either gone to rarely in the past, or had met & got numbers/testers from but never had a need to follow up - every one of them (i would guess 4 in total - so 5 times copping, this round, w/ the same basic results) had stuff that, even if it didn't have that particular ""off"" smell/taste - did next to nothing for me, even when i eventually tried doing large enough amounts that would usually 100% put me all the way to bed for the whole day & night, or worse (Stupid, maybe, but oh well. desperation does that) 

i haven't strayed from the particular part of town ive (almost) always gone to, and it's hard to really ""make a day of it"" finding new connects or corners, as i have a family at home & an intensive job to take care of - both are suffering though because i'm feeling so awful, and i feel horrible having to come up with more and more excuses, etc, both to get out of the house & go search/stay out too long, and also to explain whats 'off' about me & how low energy/sad i seem (luckily, again, no actual full on W/D to have to explain, and im grateful)

like i said - same thing happened last year, and i spent an infuriating near-month trying to sniff out something close to normal. fent's hit the city hard and the days of being able to go to (almost) any reliable corner & getting knockout raw  - and even when you get 'burned' it's just cause you get shitty raw, or a crew you go to only has scram - im not a 'good old days' person usually, i know the game done changed, i've adapted, but the times when this happen feel incredible bleak, even if the grand scheme of things, it's 1. a stupid complaint, i know and 2. my own fault - i chose this life.

wondering if anyone else has had or been having stretches of bad luck like this, what you did to get out of it, should i double down on my hunt & spread out to other parts of town, other crews, try and meet new people/numbers? wait it out? just say fuck it & eat kratom? it's not a tolerance issue - i can assure that. makes me miss having friends to run with, advise who had the fire shit, where to avoid, get new #s wed share, etc. 

best of luck to anyone going thru it in similar or worse ways - heres hoping ur luck turns & everything works out gloriously asap 
& mods, let me know if in my years away, anything changed & i need to revise this post - i read over the rules again, but in case i missed anything. thanks",1548623265.0

First not related to opis I think I broke my fuckin finger or hand. I didn't go to a doc so idfk whats the problem but it didnt move right yeah. and the mfing hand is causing me a lot of problems. I couldn't get the angle I need to hit and jabbed myself into bruise city on one arm. Bruises and not being able to do my job right cus of my hand I got fired last week, it wasn't a big deal I had two jobs and the one I lost was my part time gig but i was gonna move out of my buddy's place in feb and now i cant. He said he didn't wanna kick me out with nowhere to go but his girl wanted to move in. He talked to my brother got him to convince my parents to hear me out and if I wanted help I could go there. Thats big cause my parents don’t talk to me.

I wasn't planning on quitting rn but I know I have to get clean. I have a small collection of subs I was saving for it. I thought I'd go to my parents with my subs then taper off ad hit up some meetings, and we'd be good. I wasn't expecting they'd be unreasonable. I guess my friend told them how I was doing and, I know it sounds bad but other than losing my job I had life mostly under control. But try explaining you're semifunctional when you show up homeless at the end of a speedball bender with arms torn to hell. They made me feel like a piece of shit. Calling me out on things I didn't know were a problem. My parents said I cause them stess and they can't sleep at night cause they worry. I didn't think they cared tbh cus they shunned me. I feel bad about it but I never cut contact with them that was their idea, and they tell me they're worried. fuck then you could've called. I couldn't get a word to defend myself or say sorry. Then they tell me heres what you're gonna do, theyll let me use my subs while they organize things but then they wanna send me to detox, make me get the opiate blocking bullshit shot, and move to my aunts in ohio for an undetermined amount of time until im ""stable"".
 
First, going to fuckin ohio to get clean is a the dumbest thing I've heard. Secondly the whole plan is bs and it wasnt cool not being involved or asked my opinion. I wanna stay home I have a life here. I don't know what I'm gonna do in ohio at my aunt and uncles being an unwanted guest. My dad came to talk to me 1 on 1 and said he knows im not happy about it but its for the best. I don't think it is but try to tell them that and I'm just a junkie making excuses. I know thats my fault they dont trust me but at least they should hear me out. They backed me in a corner cause if I relapse they'll be done with me and if I leave and don't go along with this they'll be done with me. I think they're already done with me because it feels like I'm set up for failure so they can call me a fuck up and call it a day. Hell I dunno what to do. I have these problems with my family since they found out and every time they get more sick of me. I still really care about them and if they let me I'd give getting clean a real chance but they don't trust me to include my opinion. I know some people would kill for this oppertunity but I'm really thinking fuck it, if it wasn't still cold outside I'd get on mdone and sleep in my car. I wanna do the right thing but i dunno if I can. Would I be a bad person if I left?

I don't do it very often, partly because it's almost a two hour drive one way, and I'm a busy guy. I drive an old S10 with a V8 (small block) swap, and it's super sketchy. I've been saving up for a new vehicle, but I figure the longer I drive this one, the more money I'll have for a new one. 

First off it was low on oil and steering fluid. Filled those up and got going. I had to cadh my check at a walmart because it's Sunday. Sometimes they hassle me about my out of state license, but it went smoothly today. The roads are bad, and my car handles horribly in the snow. The washer pump is broken, so every ten minutes or so it becomes near impossible to see. I tried to draft behind semis whenever possible to wash my windshield, but it only works at a very small following distance. I passed five accidents on my way, and I nearly spun out a few times myself. 

I get horrible traction, so I filled the bed up with stumps and bricks and chained them in place. Still, I have to pop it into neutral if I really want to stop, and of course it pulls hard to the right. My horn is not hooked up because I like to hide my dope in the steering wheel. 

I've been going on runs like this on and off for over a decade, and I l have gotten pretty good at it. It feels like an extreme sport, but these  skills just arent marketable in a legal context. I used to middle for people back in the day when I lived in a big city, and I would always pride myself on making these missions go as smoothly and calmly as I could. I never got arrested (lots of luck), but I have been pulled over and searched many times. Nowadays i pay for a middleman, because I'm not from his city, and I appreciate having someone else to navigate and handle the transaction. He's a good guy, but I still don't let my money walk very far. I've done some shady things myself, so I don't judge any junkie for manipulating a situation to get out of withdrawals.

I was trying not to do any dope this year, but I just can't stand the regularness of everyday life (sopranos i think?). Also when I get fent, it's really hard on me due to low tolerance. My psych doctor diagnosed me with a personality disorder last week, and so far it just makes me realize how poorly i handle any social interactions. Actually Wikipedia says people with the disorder are prone to heroin and benzo abuse. I'm just too sensitive to criticism. It hurts real bad.

I don't know where I was going with this. Mostly I'm glad my mission was a success. Today was especially challenging.

Hope everybody is doing well today and has good luck on their missions, however sketchy they are.

Only can get my hands on these atm no h for a week. The only one I know that has h atm I believe has started cutting it with fent (atleast this is what I’ve heard through the grapevine through reliable friends) I have test strips but I don’t want to waste my money on fent h.

To my understanding, it cannot be snorted, and the best way of using it is either to smoke it or IV it. I've had some success with smoking, but I worry I'm losing some of the product in the process.

Would it be possible to instead plug it? Could I just dissolve the #3 heroin into some water, put it into an oral syringe, and boof it? Would that be more effective?

Alternatively, would it be possible to turn the #3 heroin into a snortable form? If so, how would I go about doing that?

My dboy was supposed to save me a sack before he sold out and had to reup. He didnt and now he is waiting to reup. Which takes some time. I did my last shot because he said he had a sack saved for me. Otherwise I would have saved it.
I feel so stupid for doing it but it is what it is.

I've kicked dozens of times. My tolerance isn't too bad. I probably only do a point or two a day but withdrawals are withdrawals. I'm tried of spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars a week. Barrowing change from my mom for gas. I want to get out of this. 

I figured since I am going to be sick for nearly an entire day anyways I should take this chance to try and quit. My boyfriend also uses and hes going to be sick too. I told him I was going to quit but he doesnt want to. So I dont know what to do. I have a cotton shot and a bag to scrape that I'm saving for him. I  cant make him quit but he is just going to prolong the pain because once I take that suboxone I want to be done.

I've been doing CWE for a few years now and feel I have the process down pretty solid.  I'm generally working with  standard norcs (10/325) and will typically CWE 10-12 of them at a time (that's 3,250mg - 3,900mg I'm needing to remove).  I often have the yellow ones and so the mixture gets dyed yellow in the process.

I think perhaps the most widely watched video I've ever come across on the topic is from this guy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESnvL564VQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lESnvL564VQ)

He's working with codeine tablets, but the process is the same.

When I watch his video or other peoples videos for that matter, they seem to have this incredibly thick and gummy substance leftover in the mixing cup (the chilled, unfiltered portion).  It seems to be a thick, viscous, fluffy-white substance.  When I do it, I find that the bottom of the mixing cup is a lot of powder.  It's not thick nor is is gummy, but there is very clearly a separated layer.

I am able to decant the mixing cup through the filters (sometime I use coffee filters and sometimes I use folded paper towels) and the final product is always extremely clear.  I never get any kind of cloudy solution at all.  The opiate certainly makes its way into the glass and that bitter taste is recognizable.

I'm hoping that somebody can shed light on why some people's paracetamol byproduct gets so thick and gummy whereas mine remains more of a powder.  I don't believe I'm doing anything wrong and I am absolutely certain that the final product is not even remotely cloudy (and it works well in terms of potency).  Still, I'm asking partially out of curiosity and partially out of concern.

I will leave the mixing cup in the freezer and periodically measure the water temperature with a thermometer to be as scientific as possible.  I usually take it out when the water in the bottom of the cup is around 35 degrees F and sometimes there is a tiny bit of ice formed at the top of the water around the edges of the cup.

Anyway, I would greatly appreciate information from anyone else who is well-versed in this and who has successfully done it before.  AM I doing something wrong or is the separate layer just sometimes not quite as thick and gummy as is demonstrated by the guy in the video I shared (and others)?

I should also note that I use his method from the start: I don't crush the pills up, I set them in a container and mix in slightly warmer than room temperature water.  I wait patiently  so I can ensure they are 100% dissolved into the water.  I will use 500ml of water for 10 x 10/325 pills.  It's always worked well.  Many thanks in advance.

EDIT: I uploaded a gallery of images here: [https://imgur.com/a/9AZiq70](https://imgur.com/a/9AZiq70) 

The first one is what they look like after I let them dissolve on their own in water.  Then they're all stirred up and placed in the freezer.  The next set is taking them out of the freezer.  You can see a thin layer of ice along the edges and the bottom layer.  Then a few pics from when I am decanting - you can see the powder at the bottom.  Finally two shots of the purified solution (again, the yellow is just from the dye of the pills.  when I use the white ones the liquid is entirely clear, but either way it is in no way cloudy)",1548561567.0

My relapses, then finally for a very long I’ve been off drugs (I stopped keeping count of exact because the way I would was bad for my recovery).

But right now we are going through a tough situation, we lost both of our jobs and I’m actively seeking. And I hear to man up a lot and start taking more initiative. So I have. 

But then today that choice of me taking initiative to protect us in the ghetto that we live in until we get out and battle our landlord through court to get our money back for crimes he’s committed and the shithole we’re stuck in... the choice of me get a tool for our home to defend us due to the crime that’s been so frequent and being the only white people around here... 

she tells me that me bringing this tool into our house is the end of us. “There is no more us, and when I leave and you leave and both of us are out of this situation, I’m not living with you in the next place. I’ll get mine and you can live where you like”.

And I tell her sorry that I didn’t know making the choice, bring a tool in, to defend us from crime would affect her to this extreme. I apologize and tell her every mistake I make I prevent it from happening again in the future and she tells me she’s not my babe, this pushes this over the edge. 

And I’m just sitting in the other room in a shocked reaction to this just trying to defend us and getting told “there is no more us now”.

It’s like she’d be more forgiving if I relapsed on oxy, the drug that brought us down for some time in our life until getting off of it all. A tool to defend and she wants no more us.. “I need a man who’s not dishonest & inconsistent who respects me. I don’t need you”.

Everyday I put consideration for her first.. I respect what she says, and I’ve manned up to make choices without question with good outcomes that made her happy, but a choice to bring something into our home to defend us is the end of us.. 

Im just sitting here shock, devastation, I don’t think I can handle a sudden breakup or divorce over a mistake that I said I didn’t know and would not bring such a legal thing in the house again. It makes me believe that all it wasn’t from me bringing in something to defend us (our family).. *but I had this vibe rather that she felt this was for a little while*, this is something she’s just using for a “legitimate reason” to end our relationship?

Guys/gals I need you help. This happened at 6:30pm.. I started typing this in a separate room at around 7:30-40pm (then phone died around that time) after “you taking the tool back or not is going change how I feel”.
It’s feels like I’m submissive to her always, and that’s a form of respect at a level. So I have been respecting her and putting myself to the side.

FYI - I am very experienced with most all US prescription pain killers and extensive abuse of for a while even some opium tea.

&#x200B;

Figured I'd share this because I've read so many confilting reviews on the effect of this opiate. Soma say they don't feel anything, others says its pretty similar to classis opaites, some say its more delirient like and can even cause hallucinations at high enough does.

&#x200B;

So here's my experience;

&#x200B;

I tooks a 100 MG tab of aspadol (genric india tapentadol) and after about 15 minutes I could definitely feel it in some way.

&#x200B;

I tooks another 100 MG tab about 45 minutes later but this time I scraped off the coating.  The effects from that mad me a little stumbly, slight euphoric, and somewhat deliriant. Definitely classical opiate properties but very much different as far as the buzz goes.

&#x200B;

I then took another 100 MG tab and 30 minutes later, this time it really started hitting me.  Stumbly, delirient like, light body, excellent paing killing properties, and it made me very close to nodding. Now I'm starting to get itchy and the nod feeling is still strong, which reallly surprised me. Even now I'm having trouble focusing on the screen because my eyes keep wobbling and wanting to shut.

&#x200B;

All in all, this is my experience so far. Just want to share that with all of you that may be interest in tapentadol. I do like it, but its very different fromc classic opioids

&#x200B;

I'd love to hear other peoples opinions of how it affected them or really any info you'd like to shae

&#x200B;

Much love you guys and thanks!

I was taking around 400mg of oxy or around 130mg of the old white circle methadone tabs a day (When things were wayyy cheaper). This was a long time ago and I had no experience with Suboxone and really did not even know what it was. The person that explained it to me had no fuckin clue what they were talking about and I ended up dissolving 2 8mg pills under my tongue when I got home with them. I would say maybe 20 minutes in is when things started to go down hill and when they did......it was absolutely fucked. The mental and physical combination of symptoms that came from out of the blue were absolutely crushing.

ak2tpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ak2tpt/been_a_sucky_couple_of_weeks_to_score/,8,https://redd.it/ak2tpt,NotPoliticalyCorrect,Been a sucky couple of weeks to score.,"So my main dealer got lifted by the police the other week along with his supplier . It was a set up and the police ambushed them . They had been meeting on the street every morning for weeks never changing it up which is obviously quiet stupid!! So after the hand over they got pounced on and the police got an Oz which was in 4 quarters and the money . The dope being split up is going to make it harder  to say it was for personal  use . There was three of them there and they all got lifted. On a Friday morning just to top it all off !! So they sat in the police station cells all weekend until court on Monday . None of them are prescribed methadone so they didn't get any. Just the detox off the police doctor 120mg of dihydracodeine and 20mg of valium three times a day . It does take the edge off and if you save up the valium for night time you'll get a sleep or at least no memory of it especially if you have no tolerance as 60mg will give you a nice glow.

 They went to court on Monday and got a 7 day lie down  though one got out as he had nothing on him and was just with my dealer. The 7 days  normally leads to a fully committal which is 140 days in prison (or bail)  so the court can prepare their case and they MUST do this or the trial can fall through and they must drop the charges though the PF (Procurator Fiscal/Public Prosecutor) can ask for extensions if bail isn't granted if you have a history of not turning up to court . If bail is granted they have to start procedings within one year if not it has to be dropped they normally set a date one day before the year is up just to be arseholes I think ! Lol 

 So when they went back up after the 7 days they both got bail which is quite common as they are just giving them rope to hang themselves with . As the police will now target you and raid your house in the months leading up to the court date to seal the deal with another charge. They know this and are trying to change up the way they deal doing it through the phone etc and only keeping a quarter on them at any time so it could be swallowed or thrown up into the air so it scatters every where. When I went there today the police where every where and thought maybe it was a bust but apparently someone got stabbed in the morning . Been quite a spate of them recently think this is the 7th one in only a couple of months . Some have been murder as well . Must be something in the water driving everyone nuts !!! Lol 

   So because he was so reliable and had every single day I lost contact with other dealers or didn't know people that had started up . So when I couldn't get off him it was a nightmare scoring ! I had to start getting a half gram every day from a guy that delivers it to your door which wasn't too bad but he was not as reliable and some days he wouldn't have or he had already left his house and was in town so I'd have to get the bus in and meet him. He did do me a tenner bag one day  as it's all I had but he still bitched about it even  though I went to his house to pick it up . He stays about a mile and  a half away from me in the next village over . I had also scored from a few other people with limited success most of the time there would be no answer on their phone . A couple of days ago I was struggling to get someone on the phone and tried my old guy just out of desperation and he answered !! Asked what happened etc and if he had and he said yeah just come in . He got from a new person and it was really good stuff ! But today he got off his guy he got lifted with and it was all right but not as good as that other stuff!!  Let's hope they start meeting in random spots and don't get ambushed again !!! Lol 

Not sure what will happen to them the guy that delivers got caught with just under an ounce last year and he's been caught multiple times over the years and fine sentances for it but this time they kept it at the sheriff court where you can only get a maximum of 5 years . He got 120 hours community service and 6 months on house arrest/electronic tag where he had to be in the house between 7pm and 7am so that was quite the result !! To day the least ! And of course got people talking ! Though that's not how things work if he had made some sort of deal he would have got a lesser charge from the police or no charge. Once it goes to court that's it . The judge must have got his hole the night before or been in the whiskey again ! Lol 

  So I hope everyone is alright and not in WD if you don't want to be or worse you have money but can't score !! A fucking nightmare !!! Lol all the best from Bonnie Scotland !! ",1548523313.0

Adderall is helpful for days when I need to work for long periods of time but there is no “high” sensation. The most concerning part is I used to love weed and smoke it everyday, and now it does nothing but make me feel slow and give me headaches. Same strains as always. Good quality.

Today I ran across the following link: 

[http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093682](http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093682)

It is my theory that there is more to PAWS than down regulation of dopamine pathways and learned behavior.

My basis for this theory was thinking that, ok, dopamine is cool and all but it is really more of a motivation control. Does it really affect energy production?  Cause that is some cellular stuff and is monitored by a large number of independent factors. And when I kick, I am motivated to take that shower but it just seems so damn hard to get off the sofa. It seems like those little mitochondria devils are just not cranking out the gas like normal.

Now I believe it to be indisputable that dope can devastate your hormonal activity across a much broader front that previously expected and, no, they do not all immediately rebound when you stop using. 

I fully expect my science friends and the first aid guy to squash me on this since I only have a regular degree and did not go further than biochem 101.  But hey, it won't be the first time and it's all good fun anyway.

It's hard to explain, but I used to use it only a couple times a month, so I guess the long half-life or whatever causes this really wasn't much of a problem then. Now, though, I have a script, so that means I can take them every day. At first, I thought that would be awesome, I get to feel good and keep my pain under control every day.

But it doesn't seem to work like that. See, I kinda ration it out and have to share, so I definitely don't take two a day as they tell me, or even a whole one at once. On some days, like when I'm running low and have to take smaller pieces, meaning there isn't that much in my system, and then the next day I get my script and take, like, a half or something, I feel really good. But, when I wake up the next day and take a half, well, the results aren't favorable. I won't feel them that much, or even at all, sometimes. 

So, what could I do differently? Could I raise/lower my dose, take different sized pieces, change when and how often I take it? I've thought about using the scientific method to figure this out, charting everything like the time I took it, the dose I used, how good it made me feel from 1-10, etc., but I kinda don't know how to get started with doing that. If only I could just exactly narrow down the variables into a solution that works for me, that'd be so awesome.

Thanks in advance, and please, no judgments!

Also, ask any questions you need to ask in order to figure this out, and I will answer as best as my pathetic memory will let me. Have a great day!",1548483822.0

0. Pee First

Pee.

1. Location  

The first thing you need to do is find the location you are going to.  The way to do this is to look online at news articles, searching for areas with significant drug problems, methadone clinics, half-way homes, et cetera.  Notorious places like  [removed] of [removed] can be a starting point.  Try to find an exact address you will go to.  

2.  Arriving at Location  

Before you get there get ready.  You want people to be able to tell who you are by the way you dress.  Don't look like a cop obviously, look like a junkie.  Dress appropriately for the street so you don't look like an easy target, or a threat.  Be safe obviously don't bring extra valuables, have your money ready and have an extra 5 atleast incase you need to pay someone for helping you score.  When you arrive at the location start by scoping out the area.  Walk all around the address you found and look for potential dealers, customers, cops, homeless people.  I usually do this for anywhere between 30 minutes and several hours.   If you're in the right place for a cold cop there should be lots of people walking around, many of them  will probably be high.  Observe people, who walks up to who.  Are people exchanging money?  Are they meeting up and then walking off behind a building for a deal?  The more you observe the more informed you will be in deciding who to talk to.  

3. Advice While Scoping the Area  

As a general rule of the people that walk up to you want something.  Ignore them.  The people that are actuating selling or aren't just tryna to get your money You will have to walk up to.  

4.  Choosing the Right Person  

Once you have scoped out the location and gotten a sense of who is where and who might be selling, its time to ask somebody for what you want.  The IDEAL people to ask are dealers- people waiting for customers to walk up.  Keep in mind this is dangerous, some people will just rob you if they think they can easily.  Second to dealers I would say is customer on their way to pick up.  if somebody looking like a junky comes out of a gas station with money and starts running or looking around for something this is a prime time to ask them for help.  They are on the way to pick up and they already have their money so they likely won't ask for anything.  Finding a customer that isn't on their way to pick up can work to but they might want something in return.  The next best option is to ask a local homeless person or other person you see standing around on the street interacting with people.  If you do this expect to be giving them a tip for helping you out and expect to not necessarily get a good deal.

I don't have years of hard drug experience but I have cold copped different things always successfully many times in multiple cities in the US.

I have used one and off 7 years, have been going for 6 months straight now after 2 years of subs.  My wife and I split a 1.75 everyday.  At lunch time (own my own business) I couldn't get ahold of my regular guy, so I called one of the backup dealers.  Keep in mind, Im in BC, there is only fentanyl around, Ive gotten used to it and I really dont think there is anything real in this city, that I will ever find, anyway.

&#x200B;

I just bought $70 worth and was about to do 2 points in my vehicle.  As soon as I took the shot, a wave came over me and I knew it was something bad.  I got kind of a stoned feeling in my head, my heart instantly started racing, I went into a horrible state of mind.  I instantly got paranoid (which I never do), turned on my vehicle and got out of there.  

&#x200B;

I knew I needed to pull over and rest, but I got the idea in my head that someone saw me do my shot, reported me, and I will get found by a cop and arrested.  I started driving, aiming for some wooded less populated neighbourhoods where I could lay low.  I thought vehicles behind me were all following or reporting me for the way I was driving.  I was trapped in a state of mind where I was too scared to pull over anywhere, but too scared to drive.  

&#x200B;

I had the needle I used sitting on my lap as I was driving around even though I put away everything else.  I was too scared to pick it up and reach over to hide it, I dont know why I had so much trouble with the rig, but I ended up with the thing inserted into my hand all the way, and then my thigh as I drove.

&#x200B;

I just slowly drove around neighbourhoods for about 45 minutes.  I managed to take some back roads and get home after an hour, where things started to subside.

&#x200B;

I can compare this feeling to something like the mindset of a bad mushroom trip.  I was so sure everyone was out to get me.  I could not even pull over at a gravel spot in the rural areas of my town.  I am thinking this may be ketamine after talking to my other dealer, but wondering if anyone may have felt the same thing and can explain what I may have took.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*About driving ""high"", after 7 years on and off heavy use, I do not get high.  Ive been pulled over about 10 times after doing a shot and never suspected of impaired driving.  I know this doesn't make it right, but I dont know many addicts who can wait to make it home. .  Anyway, Thanks for reading.

I am SO not getting this.,"I am reading here about subutex and its variations. Quite confusing. My understanding so far is that this is a partial agonist combined with a full antagonist. WTF? Why would someone do that and who would buy it? From what I gather, this is, strangely and perhaps sadly, a popular drug. Whoa, the world really has changed since my time with opiates. 

Naloxone, the enemy of fun, yet the opiate addicts best friend in case of an overdose, is combined with buprenorphine, a kind of crappy imitation dope that is best known for its ""ceiling effect"", meaning that its effect on respiratory depression is limited. This, as we all know, is half the fun of opiates, having our carbon dioxide feedback loops sabotaged, allowing us to nod in peace. And yet, this drug deliberately takes this away from us. 

Apparently this stuff is entirely synthetic, like demerol and fentanyl. Somebody made it in a lab. It was created with the idea that it had limited abuse potential and it did not produce euphoria.  Hmm. I think I've heard that one before.

I am not sure who the genius was that thought it was a good idea to combine our most powerful antagonist (you know, the stuff that makes you instantly dopesick if you are really dumb enough to take it) with the stuff I give to my cat when it is hurting.  Men move in mysterious ways and to my utter astonishment, this seems to be one of the most popular drugs on this subreddit. 

Call me crazy but I don't get it. Sadly, I am unable to test this stuff out personally due to my inconvenient commitment to a drug free life, but I am hoping there is some knowledgeable fellow out there than can make it clear to me why any human being would voluntarily take this stuff and maybe even pay real money for it?

Fascinating, Jim.  Who would have thunk it?

So I’ve been trying the Bernese method to get back on suboxone from a relapse. I relapsed for 3 days, and today I took a .5 to 1mg slice of sub , then took 3 blues throughout the day. I was on subs a week prior. I didn’t get sick from taking the sub then blue right after , but my question is, can I take sub at any time after blues if it’s in my system? 

I took said sliver of sub at 4am today then did 3 30mg blues til 4pm. If I did a piece of sub at 4am tomorrow then did a blue right after continuing the Bernese method would I be good without precipitated withdrawls? I’m gonna be driving with my dad for 5 hours so I just don’t wanna get sick driving with him that would be hell , being sick in front of him isn’t an option and I wouldn’t even take the sub at that point to be safe and sound. 

It would be 12 hours from my last blue but the sub is still in my system , so am I good to continue the Bernese method? Or do I need to wait between sub and blue dose? Thanks guys any feedback would really really help. Have a great night ",1548460069.0

I've been getting some pretty fire BTH,  doing just 1 point (100mg)  is almost enough to make me nod. Most dope takes quite a bit more to achieve this effect. Though I have yet to try some #4.

Another point I would like to add is I'm not some opiate naive user,  been doing them for years. Mostly fentanyl sublingual and oxycodone for about 4 years and now I've recently made the switch to BTH. 

My question is do you guys think I would get the most bang for my buck getting some #4 heroin instead of bth? Assuming both are very pure. I realize that #4 is a more pure form, that is intended for snorting and iv but not sure if that necessarily means its way more potent then bth. 

I mainly need it for pain purposes and to function but the euphoria is a nice bonus too. 

I'm getting the BTH for only $40/G and the #4 would cost me at least $75/G for the cheapest source,  or $100/G from another source. There's also the option of China white for about $130/G and its been tested to not contain fentanyl. 

So which do you guys think would be the best bang for my buck?

I've got a few questions for you guys. Hoping you all can help me out here. 

Alright let me start by saying ya fentanyl is a dangerous drug blah blah but I have an extremely  high tolerance and have been sublingually using strips of patches for years now. I've now migrated to mainly using BTH, usually monkey water or making it to gunpowder. And the euphoria is much better than what I've been getting from the fent. 

So heres my predicament. I've only got about a .7
Left of tar which I can probably make me last 5 or 6 days since it is absolute fire. 

I also have 1 and a half 50mcg fentanyl matrix style patches. These ones I got have been different then other matrixes I've been using. 

The backing looks like foil (compared to the usual just plastic rubbery sticker matrix type) though I've noticed the backing contains a sticky adhesive that can be scraped off. These don't really seem to hit as hard as the previous one when used sublingually.

So I tried scraping it off and smoking on foil but it really doesn't do much for me and willing to bet its pretty toxic. 

I came up with the idea that maybe it could be possible to extract the fentanyl from this matrix-foil backing patch. And my end goal would be to possibly use the extracted fentanyl to form a liquid solution that I could either use like ""monkey water"" or either use the concentrated drops for sublingual use. 

I read that ISO alcohol can be used to extract the fentanyl from the patches. Though I'm still a bit unsure about the process,  and how I would go about making this liquid solution. Would PG (propylene glycol)  be a good solution? Or would plain water be better? Any help would be appreciated.

We had small amounts of subs and kratom. Took about 5gs of kratom a few times a day until the 24 hour mark to take some subs. Took about 2mg of subs and nothing worked... the 24 hours on kratom was nothing but pain and misery I dont think it helped one bit, then the subs didnt help once we started that. 

We broke down and bought a half g, felt better, then started doing that about every day. I've noticed I get sicker quicker now like wake up in the middle of the night sick...so here's some questions if anyone has some input I would sooooo appreciate it.


Since I was doing so much dope, would a higher dose of the subs or kratom help? 
Since I've significantly decreased my intake will the WDs be less intense?
Will the subs block the effect of the kratom? Or maybe even lope? 

Maybe if someone could suggest a method to detox this time? We have 2 8mg subs left, lots of kratom all kinds of red veins, loperamide, and trazodone

How the hell can something so innocent be this evil?,"First, a little background of my current situation and how everything took a turn for the worst here lately. Nobody knows I use, NOBODY. The only person that knew about me using was my gf, but she thinks I have stopped using for at least 4 months now. So I've supposedly been clean for 4 months.... not even close. It all started 3 years ago with Roxies. Just like your stereotypical addict, It all started so innocently with 5mg Roxies when I wanted a mood boost, then I turned to everyday use, then I went to stop using and had the worst week of my life (1st withdrawal) and went right back to snorting Percocet that I started obtaining from my family Dr. She would prescribe me #45 5mg Percocet every time I would go in and complain about a skin irritation that wasn't actually causing me that much pain... That lasted all the way until last year when they had the crackdown in my state and wouldn't allow doctors to prescribe more than 5 days worth of narcotics at a time. So I turned to the onion fields and consistently had Roxies. So at that point I got myself up to 7-10 30mg blues a day. Then as funds started to get low I tried to lower myself down and I got myself down to 150mg a day and was consistently running out of money and got to the point where I couldn't keep up with my addiction. So I made the SWITCH to H and never looked back. Worst decision of my life. I have never IV'd and I never will. I literally throw up if I see a needle so I know that will never happen. I got myself up to snorting 1.5g a day of ECP and have currently gotten myself down to between .5g and .7g a day. I've been using H for about 8 months now. I currently owe every person that ever gave 2fucks about me money and have no way to pay it back but yet I keep bullshitting every one of them that I'll have it ""next week"". No chance that will happen. I know it, they know it, but nobody says anything. Nobody really suspects anything except for my significant other and that's because we live together. I'm sure everyone wonders why I supposedly make a good amount of money but yet I never have any money, and I am constantly in debt to everyone I know. I don't have any friends really, except for family so everyone I am talking about, will be around me forever, not just people I can tell to fuck off and never talk to again. Once again. nobody suspects I use H, it would be the absolute farthest thing from their mind.... But in reality I'm railing lines all day no matter where I'm at and everything in my life revolves around me having my dope. I hate this life more than anything. I wouldn't wish this shit on my worst enemy. Lately I have been sick a lot more than usual because I run out of money and sometimes it'll be a day or 2 before I can get anything because I also rely on the onion fields for everything. It's just really obvious to my gf when I'm throwing up constantly and can't function at all if I don't have any dope but yet I swear up and down I'm off the shit... She is suspicious as hell right now to say the least. I don't know what to do at this point. I want to get off the shit so bad and it's literally all I think about is getting off of it but I just can't bring myself to get sick and stay sick. Like my WD are so fucking bad I literally throw up constantly for 2 days or more, because I've never gone more than 4 days because its so bad I end up getting more dope and railing it to feel better. The longest withdrawal of my life was this past summer when my gf found my dope while I was in the shower and freaked out on me and flushed the shit right in front of me.... we were only 2 days into our week long vacation and she had no idea what withdrawals were and also had no idea how bad I was addicted, so you can only imagine how that vacation went.... Anyway she thinks it was crushed up pills, but really it was H and she still has no idea that I am addicted to H. I hate myself for doing this to myself and everyone around me, I wish I could take back the last 3 years of my life but as we all know, we can't do that shit and we got to move forward. So my question to anyone that cares to make it this far is: How can I get off this horrible drug as soon as possible and stay off?? I literally cannot stand the WD, I am trying to get myself down to .25g/day within the next 3 days and jump completely from there. I have literally ran out of money so I can't afford to buy anymore. How bad will my WD be? Will I still be hugging the toilet constantly for 2 days and not even be able to smoke a blunt without throwing up? I feel like I can do it if I know there is hope on the other side and know that this shit is just temporary, that's what really messes me up is thinking that the shit will never end while I'm sick. I cannot go to a clinic, because I don't have the money to do so and also I don'd want this to be on my medical record at all. I need to keep this as low key as possible but I know that is going to be hard AF if WD are going to last weeks or more....

I have been on and off using oxy for about 3 years. For the first 2.5 years I was able to control my usage and utilize kratom for the light to moderate withdrawal periods when I realized the oxy use would start getting out of control. 

Recently kratom has not been doing the trick. Last time I had to curb the oxy I had to taper myself down before I could use kratom to take a 3 week break from oxy. That was about 3 months ago. 

Over the last 3 months my tolly has been creeping up to about 80-120 ish mg per day usually in 2 doses throughout the day over the past month. 

Would it be possible to help me come up with a taper plan to help bring me down to zero. I have plenty of kratom and two 8mg oxy strips. I’ve read all the horror stories on here about PWD and want to avoid that at all costs.  Currently in order to stave off WD I need to take about 40mg  oxy in the am (8am-ish) and I can last till about 3 pm until i take another 40 mg . Sometimes I’ll take some kratom to help me sleep. 

Main wd symptoms are restless legs and anxiety with some light stomach issues. Some fatigue etc. no vomiting or chills. Velarian root tincture and melatonin help me sleep. And I take magnesium supplements daily 

Should I even bother with the sub strips? Or should I just continue to lower my oxy intake with the kratom at night to help me sleep and patiently taper until I can only use kratom? I have zero experience with subs. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you ",1548445495.0

Maybe it’s just me but it feels like certain people will talk to me as if they see thru my cover like “you may have everyone else fooled by I can see you”

Not in a negative sense it’s more like they want to help me but I have to ask. It usually goes something like this them: “is everything ok with you, u know if u need help with something I’m here for you” me: “yeah thanks” them: (usually grabbing my hand or putting there hand on my shoulder looking directly into my eyes) “I mean it please tell me if u need help please remember I’m here for you” me:” ok yeah thanks I’ll remember that” them: with a concerned or disappointed look “ok take care of yourself”

ajsojy,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ajsojy/success_and_immediate_gratification/,3,https://redd.it/ajsojy,throwaway666718,Success and immediate gratification,"For the past few days, I've been trying to learn how to smoke #3 heroin from aluminum foil (chasing the dragon). For whatever reason, I was really terrible at it and just ended up either burning the dope or letting all the vapor escape before I got to suck it in through my tooter. 

I remembered reading that it's much easier and more efficient to smoke #3 dope from a meth pipe than it is off foil. So I went out and got a little pipe. Don't know how much I smoked, but it was a great success. 

After a 3 week binge of doing 10/325 oxys every night, I had developed a huge tolerance and taking 10 of them at once (RIP my liver) would only give me a buzz. Eventually, I ran out and decided it was time to try heroin. It was only a matter of time before I did, so I said fuck it.

I've never felt euphoria or a ""rush"" from taking pills (orally/intranasally). I've tried codeine, tramadol, vicodin, percocet, morphine, tussionex, and dilaudid, but to no avail. Of course, they made me feel really good, and that's why I kept doing them, but they never gave me the famous rush and euphoria that everyone hear talks about. 

I thought heroin would, but still, nope. I guess I feel euphoric but I think I'm just happy I finally managed to smoke it properly. Regardless, I feel great. My back and neck pain are gone and my anxiety has melted away. I was so tired of having to crush up 10 fucking pills and then down them all at the same time just for a 30min long buzz.

I copped a gram and I'm gonna do my best to ration it and try not to develop a habit. Please spare me the warnings, I'm well aware of how dark this path can be, and I've read all the horror stories about how people have lost everything to this drug. But for now, I'm just enjoying the high and living in the moment. Thanks for reading :)",1548444880.0

‘It's better than just depressed I suppose’


I lay on my bed staring at the blank ceiling, taking hits from a splif. Waiting for the warmth of a high to grace me with it's presence, I reflected on the incident. 

><=><=><=><=><=><=><


Brooke had decided she wanted to move in, and being young, dumb, and full of cum. I  said yes without a hesitation. 


She had packed everything she wanted, cat included, and Lucas and Mira had agreed to help us move her out of her parents.


We had decided on a Friday afternoon, when everyone should have been gone… But when we parked all the cars were home and we knew it wasn't gonna be a good time. After 5 minutes of shouting Brookes mom asked if the past 6 months we had just spent high and having sex. With nothing to lose that I could see, I said “Yup”, no half assed apologies just truth. Brooks mother stared in disbelief,  as I stood up to start moving boxes.


Her father wasn't in the living room thankfully, he was short, but he was a wall of muscle and testosterone. I made trips to and from brookes room to the front door, since Lucas and Mira were barred from the house. All of a sudden out of nowhere Chris, Brookes father appeared in front of me on the stairs yelling. I dropped the boxes as I evaded his first throw at me.


Growing up with Mik my best friend back home. At 18 we fought each other every Saturday, Fight club style in an abandoned neighborhood development. So getting beat and taking punches is something I could handle.


The thing Mik never was able to do was pick me up and throw me into the wall. Exactly how Chris had.


‘Oh god, thats a stud’ I think, as I floundered in gasping agony.


Chris continued to hold my collar and threaten me within an inch of my life. I considered it to be better than being hulk smashed into the wall again. After a minute he leaves to Brookes room, I mutter “oh shit”. I ran the boxes to Lucas and ran back to Brookes room.



Brooke was crying her nose was bruised, right then and there I wanted to kill Chris. The last boxes were put in cars, along with the cat. Brook was in tears and I was venting to my mother on the drive to stop at Miras. We calmed down by the time we got there, no more hysterics or punching things.


I wanted drugs though, I had a bit if weed in the car and some Xanax at my apartment, but behind the mask I knew what I wanted. I wanted to be high, I wish I hadn't poured the last of Brookes Oxy syrup into a Pepsi…


‘Soon’ I hope.


Brooke, Lucas, Mira, Val and I unloaded the car that afternoon and partied all night. I slipped upstairs twice to snort or parachute .25mg of Xanax. Life was ok, I was in a safe place, surrounded by my friends, and I was on a comfortable combo of drugs.

><=><=><=><=><=><=><


But today, today Brooke was somewhere, and I was alone before Adin came home. As the high washed over me I wonder about my substance use. 


‘Do I always use too much?’ 


‘Nah, nah, I can stop whenever I want’ I muse.


Coursing through me is .5mg of Alprazolam, real bars from my friend Jeff, not the pressed colored ones. Along with this was two shots Bacardi with pineapple juice, and all the cannabinoids I could handle, before my splif was all tobacco. 


‘I need to be high, just a break, I can't stand the constant venting to me’ 


I put in my headphones gingerly as my body aches. Where Is My Mind plays and I let my mind drift into the ether, just a little break...

I started to taper, no real plan in mind, just doing less each day. Soon I reached the point of doing ridiculously small amounts of dope but I realized that I simply was not going to be able to stop this way. The dope, in 2018, was mostly fentanyl and that stuff would not let go of my brain as long as I was injecting.

So I start sniffing instead. I begin with a very healthy line and work my way down to a matchhead. And I'll be a goddamned Georgia redneck if I still could not kick symptom free.

Huh. Ok. I can deal with this. I decided oxy 30s would be the ticket. I crush and sniff and work my way down the ladder again. I reach the go - no go point with this dosage and transfer to percocet 10 mg. I taper down to 2.5 mg per dose, and now I am taking this 2-3 times per day.

Unfortunately, when I stop completely, I am still getting classic symptoms of wd. This is making no sense to me, based on my knowledge of how withdrawal works. However, in all fairness, I am at this point rather impatient and decide to go all in, meaning I stopped all opiates and just went through the next five days.

So everybody knows that story. Feel horrible then feel better, more or less. But the interesting point here is, how much longer would I have needed to micro dose to end up with no withdrawal symptoms?

Current theory is that withdrawal starts soon after the last opiate molecules are cleared off your brain receptors. This is demonstrated clinically by use of naltrexone induction. This chemical binds strongly to your opiate receptors, so that no opiate can now interact with your brain. In effect, the opiates have received an eviction order and are forced to vacate. When this happens, you feel better a few days later and are done, unless you have been using long enough to really mess with your brain and have to deal with post acute withdrawal symptoms.

But here is the interesting part. I have heard stories for years of people micro dosing. Like doing 1 mg of methadone per day before stepping off. I tended to discount these stories as being a placebo effect for people that were, maybe, not the strongest people mentally.

But son of a bitch if this method was not confirmed by my 2.5 mg of oxy. To my way of thinking, this was a sub-clinical dose, way too small to have any effect on an experienced addict. This theory proved incorrect, as the dose completely prevented onset of withdrawal symptoms.

But the really interesting question is - how long would I have needed to continue and how low would I have to have gone to really finish the detox? I guess I'll never know, at least from personal experience. Using, say, 1 - 2 mg of oxy is incredibly economical and of course simple math reveals that even one pill could last quite a while. I believe I would have reached a point eventually at which my brain would have said - ok, enough, my receptors are healthy. You are off the hook. Have a nice life.

Micro dosing of opiates has not been studied much in available literature, as far as I am aware. It is apparently something new. I would love to hear your experiences about this concept, from anyone who may have been ahead of the curve and done things this way.",1548423967.0

I wrote my Ex a check today for $800 to help her out and pay some fines so she won't have a warrant. I know the fines will probably not get paid in the end, but that's on her. 

One of her girl friends came and saw me and told me that Ex had said something kinda off the cuff about putting a 1 in front of the 8 and making it $1800 and on the line where you spell out the numerical value ""Eight Hundred"" just adding -een onto the Eight so it reads ""Eighteen Hundred"" .. Do you think this would work? I waited to give her the check around 4:30 because I knew the branch right by my house closed at 4, (she didn't know that). 

&#x200B;

I knew if she had $800 after 5pm when the county clerks office/courthouse closed that money would not make it until the morning & the fines would not be paid. 

So, what do you guys think? Would her little sketchy plan work? or would my Bank refuse a check that read ""Eighteen Hundred"" vs ""One Thousand Eight Hundred""? ",1548407742.0

I first took Kratom because I heard it had the same effects as a mild opioid/opiate and had to be ingested in high amounts to be recognized cognitively as such. I started out taking 5 grams at a time because my tolerance to oxycodone was at around 15mg. Fast forward to now.. Tolerance to morphine is at 120mg and oxycodone is at 45mg. Kratom used to get me as high as 50mg of Hydrocodone would but now I don't feel ANY opiate/opioid I take because I've been taking Kratom in doses of 10g+ at a time, one to two times a day since I can't find a steady supply of anything else. I have gone through withdrawal from Oxy but Kratom withdrawal makes me want to die. My blood feels like its on fire. My joints and muscles ache. I am tired constantly. I can't stop writhing every few minutes. What at makes these feelings worse is that I can't get high even if I tried. Good news is that I have been tapering down the past 2 weeks and my dose is only at a total of 7 grams a day. I hope I can kick this sickness so I can actually get high one last time.

It is now penetrated my brain that probably the biggest specific issue across the opiate board is insomnia.  I think maybe this basic issue is obscured by the devastating and Poe like nightmare of withdrawal and, for those who have quit, the bitch of PAWS low energy complaints.

And yet, if we get down to the lowest common denominator, sleep has be the holy grail. Personally, I had sleep issues when I was 13. They only stopped when I first started opiates. And the nod was always golden for me, as long as it lasted. In retrospect, sleep was always a concern. Now I'm off dope about two months and it really is a problem.

During the past few days I must admit to being a little shocked by the people on this forum. And by that I mean that there are some really smart guys and guys (and of course girls) who are extremely resourceful, inventive and will leave no stone unturned in their collective quests to feel better, whether for good or ill.

So, by the power vested in me as an ex-junkie I now request and require you to give up your sleep secrets, as I am in dire need.

However, a quick Google search shows that Heroin in its pure form is just ""diamorphine"" or diacetylmorphine.  This drug is used in hospitals all the time...?  My twins were born via C section. When I was in the room for all that, I heard the doctor call for diamorphine at 5mg or whatever. I recognized it and giggled and asked the doc ""so you're giving my wife heroin huh?"" and he laughed and said ""yes, how did you know that?""

Last week I made a post about using heroin close to the time of surgery. I said that I was going to stop about ten or more days before.

Well that didn't really go as planned. I have surgery in five days and I just used today. I've gone through about 2 grams of dope since starting and have tapered off pretty well to just using once a day, less than 100mg. 
I'll be getting general anesthesia. I had spoken to the nurse and told her casually that I had used some opiates a few weeks ago and she didn't seem phased but I wasn't especially honest with her. 


So I'm just wondering what the repercussions using this close to surgery will be. Will withdrawing the day of surgery(or being in slight withdrawal) have any affect of the surgery? Is there any reason why they would refuse to give me surgery? I don't care about the pain afterwards but I need to get the surgery done and I can't really afford to reschedule.It's a simple outpatient procedure and I should only be under for about an hour.

I was doing 100mg-130mg of OxyContin a day when I quit cold turkey and this is by far the best detox I’ve had in the last 8 years of my addiction, I’m currently waiting to get into rehab for my third time and I’m really hoping this will be the last time I ever have to deal with it this hell of an addiction.
For this detox remedy you will need money and resources, luckily for me I have great health coverage which helped a lot with this process, never the less if you don’t have coverage this process is still doable but you’ll have to invest a little more of your own money which shouldn’t be a problem given the amounts you’ve probably spent/spend on opiates.
On my first day clean I went to a wellness centre/naturopath that offered IV treatments, I got a IV drip of vitamins called the Myers Cocktail which is vitamin C, B1, B5, B6, B12, Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Selenium, Copper, Manganese and Chromium.
This IV vitamin drip is great for Asmtha, Migraines, Fatigue, Muslce spasm, Colds and Flus, Fibromyalgia, Anxiety, Depression, Chronic Stress, Insomnia, and Hormonal Imbalance. As I said I have great coverage for health benefits but If you don’t you can purchase this one time treatment for a decent price.
I honestly think this was the main reason my detox was so painless, I didn’t get the usual depressing down feeling from the lack of serotonin cause my body received all of the proper nutrients and my mood was remarkably even better then when I’m sober from drugs in general, I feel that this IV drip also helped a lot with my restless legs and all of the usual symptoms in general.
Through out the whole process I drank a shit load of water to stay hydrated and bought some ginger roots which I bowled in water and drank as well (ginger is known for its detox benefits).
For the first 3 days I went to my local GoodLife gym and stayed as long as I could in the steam room, again this helps a lot with detoxing shit out of your body and I got massages every 2nd day (specifically for my legs to prevent restless legs) but I also got the rest of my body massaged to release more serotonin in my body to help fight the sickness.
Hard to believe but with this simple remedy I swear to god I had the most painless detox of my life, I did have a little bit of a runny nose and a few cold flashes through out the days but that was it, I didn’t get any restless legs or that terrible pain which feels like every single bone in your body hurts or the long sleepless nights.
I also took 0.5 of xans for the first 4 nights before sleep just to make sure I would fall asleep but I could of honestly done without them.
I’m hoping maybe this can help people out as I’ve tried so many remedies and nothing has ever came close to working good as this.
Thanks for taking the time to read and I hope this can hopefully help someone out.",1548367592.0

I relapsed months ago and have been using H/Fent (who knows???) for the past couple of months, up to 20 bags a day of ECP. Equates to about 2 grams. I tried suboxone and almost died from the PWD, so it  scared the shit out of me and I never wanna touch it again.

I took 30 mg of methadone about an hour ago after using my last gram of ECP this morning. For some reason, I expected my minor WD to go away and to feel decent. But this isn’t the case. I have a headache now, I am still getting some chills and just feel nauseous and terrible. And angry.

What’s the case here??? I thought methadone doesn’t give you PWD..... I know it doesn’t, actually. Should I take more? Or give it time?

I actually just took another tablet, so 35 mg now. Am I doing something wrong?

My plan is to quickly taper off using these 40 tablets (200mg total).

Had a flat in the first council estate built in London that is left standing to this day . a corner flat on the top floor. He lived in the kitchen. Den and the other room was for anyone. A popular female singer recently passed who had a love of black chlothes and makeup. Room free, billy always there,eals on wheels delivered everyday.

The big deal for me is still no energy - I watch people walking around outside my window and wonder how the hell are you doing that? That is amazing. 

So I have read up on the whole paws thing and the consensus among medical guys seems to be that your dopamine is messed up and that's what is causing you to be sick, even though you have been clean for 2 months to possibly even 2 years.

Now I am starting to wonder whether these people know what they are talking about. The more I read, the more I am starting to doubt the dopamine story. There are a few scientists that say there are other neuro transmitters responsible for paws, not dopamine.

Hmm, ok. So if that is true, what is really going on?

Personally, I have tried a number of cutting edge supplements purported to raise dopamine levels. Over several weeks, I have not seen much in the way of results.

So let's say you entertain my theory. What else could it be? There are many diseases that can cause low energy, anxiety, depression, etc. but let's posit that you were ok while you were using so you probably don't have any new disease.

There is one other explanation that fits the bill, from what I can see. I am wondering if paws is a result of the suppression of the hormone testosterone.

If you google this, you will find that lowered sex drive and loss of energy, fatigue are all hallmarks of low testosterone. Testosterone also plays a big part in self confidence, aggressive drive and general motivation.

Sound familiar? I sure as shit am no big stud at this point. I feel weak, I don't want to engage, I am very non-aggressive. In short, I am the worst version of me. I am the opposite of me.

It is a proven fact that opiates can lower hormone levels. Google it if you doubt me.

What do people say helps more than anything with paws?

Exercise. It is almost universal that people will tell you that this is critical in dealing with this condition. And exercise is one sure way to raise testosterone levels.

What other links exist? 

Diet - a common advice for paws is to eat plenty of protein which contain amino acids that are precursors to dopamine. Surprise! Amino acids are also vital for testosterone and other anabolic hormones. 

I could go on but I am getting tired of typing. Suffice it to say that factors that could possibly increase dopamine levels correlate closely with factors that increase testosterone levels.

Hopefully some medical people will read this. I don't want to be excessively insulting, but the medical pharmaceutical professions have a long history of leading us down the garden path.

Like valium is not addictive. Heroin is not addictive. Psych drugs are safe and effective and you will not have any withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking them. Your problem is cholesterol, not all that sugar you eat.

All of these statements were made by medicos when these drugs first came out or when heart disease was first studied.

Doctors, like many humans, tend to follow the party line. They will spout the most amazing bullshit with a straight face if you don't educate yourself. They have created many addicts as I am sure you guys know. So I no longer trust that this guy who went to school for like twenty years and has a lot of experience is better equipped than me to analyze facts. Because I have a magic weapon named google.

I guess time will tell, but if you are not having any success relieving your paws symptoms, check out testosterone. There is a ton of information about it because of all our great athletes who use roids to enhance their performance.

More or less I was told that they do not allow sale or purchase of drugs on premises... I was then told that drug use is not ""allowed"", however they do have a bathroom (didn't check it out but surely it has a sharps bin, maybe more), and I guess the policy is that you may ""use"" the bathroom *wink-wink* for 10 minutes max... they check in on you after 5 minutes through an intercom.

I was blown away by this needle exchange. I'm mad at myself for all the dull barbed rigs I've reused, they let you take as many as you'd like within reason and don't require a count and exchange to get more. They also, like the one lady said, ""make it rain narcan"". I try to grab some every time I go down there, I've got a little stockpile and plan to pass some out to some people I know. Oh and holy shit they even gave me micron filters when I asked! Not wheel filters, but these cool ones I've never seen before that fit like a sheath over the tip of the needle. Sterifilt they are called. Super easy and fun to use. 

I don't know how other needle exchanges are, but I was really impressed with everything about the place. Not to mention the exchange is only one small part of the (beautiful and clean) health facility. Gonna check out the Hep C test next.

TL;DR, my needle exchange has a bathroom that your *wink* not allowed to shoot up in. Sounds like the closest thing to a safe injection facility in the US, and I'm curious if other harm reduction exchanges have such an ""understanding"" in regards to drug use on premises. ",1548322736.0

I took just one pill orally, watched some YouTube videos and few minutes later I felt ah-mazing! I mean, it was such a beautiful feeling, it was almost as if all my problems were suddenly resolved, and everything seemed so trivial. Nothing mattered anymore. I was so positive.

The thing is, which is also my question, after the effects wore off (about 6 hours later), I didn’t go back to my previous mental state. My depression was less stronger. When I woke up the next morning, I wasn’t experiencing any sad thoughts or overthinking the same depressing shit. Is this common? Do Opioids really help with depression?

Currently I am seen at the VA by just my Primary Care. He prescribes me lyrica 150mg 3 times a day and 10/325 hydrocodone 1-2 pills a day as needed. 

Last week he called me in for a drug test that I was completely ok taking since I had took a pain med. The morning prior. I called this morning to get a refill on my medication and he said he could no longer prescribe my pain medication since the UA came back negative for opiates. 

I'm at a loss on what to do. Can I go to another doctor with failing the drug test? Iv tried a lot of other options for treating the pain but the pain medication is what gets me through at the moment. ",1548284996.0

Tramadol came into my possession and after doing some research and staring at the pill for about an hour going back and forth in my mind, I decide to take one then wait 30 minutes and take another one.
The plan was to take 100mg or 150 max and if I didn’t feel anything then that was that.
So at 100mg I start zoning out just a little bit and decide one more won’t hurt, so I’m in my room zoning out and with a noticeably elevated mood and think “this is fucking great, I’ll cap it at 200mg”. It was 3 AM at that point, after that I vaguely remember walking around my house then, next thing I know, it’s 8AM and I’m waking up from my bed.

Nothing seems wrong at this point, though I’m having trouble remembering last night. Then I try to stand up and was instantly greeted by my couch again and the nausea hits me. I spend the next few hours on my couch, sipping water and feeling like shit. I make trips to the bathroom to throw up but keep falling asleep on the toilet seat but only for a few seconds. I keep having short but very vivid dreams. Eventually I throw up twice and am now feeling slightly better but it took hours.

Never touching an opiate ever again, that was a nightmare",1548282191.0

A little about me:

I started popping Oxy 5mg about 10 years ago after some dental work and fell in love. I slowly but surely moved up to Oxy 30mgs. I have pretty severe anxiety and pot and alcohol just makes it worse, so they aren’t efficient ways to help me cope. Oxy really helps mellow me out and gives me some relief from my anxiety.

I buy 3 every Friday and split them into halves and quarters  to try to make them last to the following Friday, but rationing them makes me have to pick and choose what days I can use them and it’s a bummer. I’d buy more at a time but I live in a state where they’re $40 a pill and I don’t have the best paying job.

I’m just curious; are they generally this expensive in other states? Also, does anyone have any advice/alternatives that would help with my situation?Should I just tough it out and quit? I know I’m addicted but I don’t feel like I’m so far gone were I can’t quit if I gave it my all. Sorry for rambling, I’m just completely alone here. There’s no one I can turn to.

Now that I’m 18 I can be honest, but I’ve been posting on this sub to ask questions and just talk to fellow junkies since I was 16.

Back to the detox. I am going to a psychiatric facility, a psych hospital, for detox either this evening or tomorrow morning. I’m telling my parents (which I still live with) that I am going to get off the Suboxone, and they believe me. Now that I’m 18, they won’t be contacted by the facility for anything, so I don’t have to worry about that.

The other times I’ve been, I went as a 17 year old and was therefore admitted as an adolescent and into an adolescent unit. I liked this, being able to talk to people my age rather than 50 and 60 year old real loons. The adolescent unit was mostly full of about 9 or 10 suicidal teens, mostly friendly and 100% approachable.

When I went at 17, I went for a week to detox, relapsed the day I got out, and was back at the same hospital a week later for an intentional heroin overdose. My buddies from before we’re still there, and the staff, particularly the adolescent therapy guy, were super cool. I developed a pretty close relationship with the therapist. We still talk sometimes.

Anyways, I just turned 18 a month ago. My parents don’t even know I relapsed over a month ago. They think I’ve still been on Suboxone this whole time. The truth is, I had to go without my Suboxone for 10 days back in December due to an insurance issue, and I couldn’t handle 10 days without it. I relapsed hard and when I finally got my script I traded it with my plug. 30 8 mg strips for a quarter. Seemed like a good deal to me. Too bad I blew through it in a week.

So, I’m returning to the facility as an adult for detox. I’m hoping it’s as pleasant as my first 2 experiences as an adolescent. I hope they give me subs and clonidine and ambien again. I hope there are fellow patients there that I can actually talk to. 

Anyways, wish me luck guys. I feel like this time is gonna be it. I feel like I’ll actually stay on the right track this time. 

Btw, my intention is to get back on Suboxone maintenance. We’ll see how receptive they are to that idea.",1548269270.0

Is it possible for someone without a history of prior opioid abuse to experience mild withdrawal like symptoms after 2 weeks of taking 5-15 mg of hydrocodone? If so, how long should it last? If so, is it true that the same dosage could now cause the same symptoms after less consecutive days of use?

I took 5-15 mg of hydrocodone with a few (2 or 3) tylenol 3s on the days I only took 5mg for 2 weeks straight. I have some neck/back problems. Nothing near what many people deal with that warrants consistent pain management, but I have days that are bad enough where I can't focus on anything I'm doing or what people are saying to me because I'm so aware of the pain. So occasionally I'll get a few pain killers from someone who has them. By occasional I mean it probably averages out to a couple days a month over the year but some months it's none and some months it's as many as 10 days.

This is the 1st time I've taken some consecutively for more than a few days. My back problems have been worse than ever lately, but on the 3 or 4 good days I took some anyway because honestly I wanted to avoid dealing with some emotional shit that was making me depressed and in turn giving me insomnia. Otherwise I've never abused opiates before, but did enjoy the high. My best friend was addicted to heroin when we were 18-20 and I've been around while some fucked up shit went down so I was really turned off to the idea of even taking them if prescribed for a while. I've also had an issue with stimulants many years ago so I knew the combo of a psychological addiction with physical dependence would be messy. But I never really witnessed anyone in the midst of the first days of withdrawals.

I wasn't going to take one Sunday (day 15) but I woke up from an afternoon nap aching all over and feeling feverish. I thought I was getting sick with the flu and took one so I could hopefully sleep lots and successfully fight off the bug. So now I haven't taken a pain killer since Sunday night. Monday and Tuesday my joints (fingers and knees) and shins were aching kind of like growing pains, I couldn't seem to get comfortable trying to sleep and kept tossing and turning, and at times my temperature regulation was all off. All annoying enough to make the day less enjoyable, especially the aches, but nothing bad enough to prevent me from doing anything I needed to do. Basically just enough to make getting into a movie or falling asleep tricky. I also had some loose stool, but no increased frequency, and I have some GI problems so that happens sometimes. Today (Wednesday) I'm still achey but I also have stomach cramping and really have the shits (to the point I'm working from home) which is much more severe than any issues I would normally have.

My husband takes 1mg of suboxone a day but will be 3 years clean in a month (so proud!!!) after 10 years of shooting dope. When describing/complaining that I must be fighting off some weird bug last night he said it kind of seems like I'm having very mild withdrawal symptoms. I took some gabapentin (my rx actually but I opted to never take it and gave it to him for if/when he tries to get off his suboxone completely) and I was able to get comfortable to sleep and my joints stopped aching as bad but my regular back pain didn't go away. It seems crazy to me that such light use for 15 days could cause symptoms and that maybe it's a combo of some other things including a stomach bug instead.

Is it really that possible it's mild withdrawal? If so, shouldn't I feel better tomorrow? I feel bad asking my husband much more and making it seem like I'm complaining when I know this is nothing compared to what being dope sick truly is, especially since I've been complaining about my actual bad back pain so much more lately.

My husband also said that if it is that then if I ever do need to take painkillers again I might need to be more careful because it's more likely I'd have these symptoms again after less consecutive days of use. Is that true? He wasn't too sure on that since I never take a large dose and he was a pretty heavy user (At least I think it must be considered heavy...we first became friends when he was 2 weeks clean but he was prescribed 24mg of suboxone a day at first which is more than I've usually heard and said he was still very dope sick for the first 3 or 4 days). Apart from that, I guess it doesn't matter that much to know what's going on but I work as a scientist studying the brain and medical ""mysteries"" just drive me crazy.

Even if this isn't from opiods and even though I've lost many friends to heroin addiction over the years, experiencing a bug that kind of resembles withdrawal symptoms at just a small fraction of the intensity brings about a whole new level of understanding and compassion toward the struggles. Many congrats to those who are clean and much love to anyone who has struggled with opioid addiction past or present < 3",1548267681.0
