I am in need of serious help from you all. I knew this is the community and place I could turn to . My friend is involved with this guy who is a total psycopath. On the outside he's incredibly smart and educated. He finally admitted to drugging her with what I think is Ketamine or GHB. She wanted me to meet him, so I did this weekend. We stopped at his place before going out to the bars. He poured us three shots, now I knew what she had told me. Meaning, I wasn't taking anything this knucklehead gave to me and was going to watch my drink all night. I walk up while his back to us and he's using a syringe and putting this clear white gooey stuff that looks like kids Tylenol out of a white bottle. So I questioned him, he told me it would us relax and have fun. But I'm no idiot . I refused the shot and looked at the bottle. Here comes my question... I thought I would remember what its called but I don't. It starts with a Bl or Bu- something. Is it possible this is some horse tranquilizer that has the same effect? Is this Ketamine, what is it? Opiates?  I need to prove to her what this is. On a weird fucked up note she says she fine with him giving her wierd stuff cause she's sucked into this loser. He's convinced her its ok and it doesn't do anything. Any ideas? We have to save this girl, I think if I could look it up or understand it and tell her what could happen she'll snap out of it. PS. I didn't take it and don't know that effects first hand. This is to help her and to check what it could do to her.",1571770658.0

So we drink I don‚Äôt even get drunk so I take out my vyvanse prescription and we both dose 60mg vyvanse we take a trip to my community pool in the next neighborhood over keep in mind I have a pool no right to be there we just wanted to use the jacuzzi. I get very paranoid we leave in around 2 hours I decide the vyvanse isn‚Äôt hitting hard enough so I take 20mg more at around 3 am and we walk the streets listening to music. Now it‚Äôs 5 am I decide to take 20mg more vyvanse and 900mg Gabapentin and 40mg of baclofen I get tired but we end up talking and then spend 100 dollars on this haunted house that we have which is like a fair with 6 haunted houses and a corn maze. So I take 4 more bacs and 4 more gaba to get some sleep to go to the haunted houses/fair. So I don‚Äôt want to be coming down at this fair we spent good money on these tickets so I bring 40mg more of baclofen and 400mg more Gabapentin and 3mg of Xanax like a very smart person now keep in mind some how I‚Äôm still really feeling the vyvanse it‚Äôs nothing like 3 am the night before but I still feel it. We get there somehow get past the metal detector with my dads 500 dollar switchblade I wasn‚Äôt suppose to have at this point I did t really know it but I was really really really fucked up im usually not this careless.

So my friend who we can call mark calls me up and tells me he got his hands on some DMT which I‚Äôve always wanted to try but I was afraid because it‚Äôs now 10:30 pm and I‚Äôm still high even though I took all my pills at around 6:45 pm. So George then tells us his brother who‚Äôs in college (were all seniors 18) is having a college party at his apartment which is pretty far so I think cool I‚Äôll have time to sober up and try the DMT when I get home. We get there and this kids got a weed pen and I haven‚Äôt smoked in around 2/¬Ω 3 months at this point and I‚Äôm already still insanely fucked up. I hit his pen 3 times so now I‚Äôm incredibly stoned I‚Äôm so out of it I could barley walk.

Here‚Äôs where I get very very careless I somehow have never had Jell-O shots in my life I say to myself hey I have a alcohol tolerance some how why don‚Äôt I have two shots (in my extremely retarded fucked up brain) keep in mind on the car ride back from the fair and to this party I have this very strange electric feeling in my hands I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it but very strange feeling not very intense though. So I take two Jell-O shots and ask George‚Äôs brother how much alcohol was actually in these things and he says two shots each. At this point I‚Äôm freaking the fuck out as the alcohol starts to kick in. The electric feeling in my hands is getting very very strong.

I walk upstairs where a bunch of college kids and Mark are playing super smash brothers to try to get my mind off the feeling in my hands which has now spread to my feet as well. I‚Äôm extremely fucked up to the point I couldn‚Äôt even play the video game I used to love that game as a kid and I got beat by a girl who had never played I could barley talk at this point.

This is where things start to get really really scary. The electric feeling is getting so strong it‚Äôs uncomfortable I‚Äôm not twitching especially in my hands to where I kept either dropping my phone or twitching so bad I‚Äôd almost drop it and then catch it. I start losing consciousness at this point Mark was up there with me he was having to shake me and yell at me to keep me awake I really think I would‚Äôve died if I did fall asleep. I‚Äôm twitching while nodding so hard it was almost comparable to taking why too much oxy. So a few hours pass like this and we get a Lyft the driver was like retarded so it took us about an hour to get home. At this point thankfully I‚Äôm almost sober not nodding but that feeling in my hands is still there and I‚Äôm still twitching. 

Then mark suggests we both do DMT and since apparently I‚Äôm retarded keep in mind I‚Äôm NEVER EVER this careless with drugs or alcohol. But I was so fucked up that night I hooked up with a hard 6 and 8 which not to sound like a dick but it‚Äôs usually 9s or 10s that‚Äôs just not like me is the point. First I do a small amount of DMT because I‚Äôm extremely nervous and wanna get a feel for the drug. I absolutely love it it was as euphoric as opiates with amazing visuals. So Marks does a heavy dose then we wait about 20 minutes and he suggests I try to break through. I do a large amount of DMT it feels amazing but this time I don‚Äôt breakthrough but I come close to losing it. I close my eyes and my head falls over I see amazing beautiful patterns and shapes them I see my mother who has disowned me I see my ex girlfriend who I‚Äôm madly in love with I see my life long best friend who also dropped me and then I fall asleep in that position. Next I had absolutely no dreams it would only be described as what death would feel like in my mind just absolutely nothing just black it felt like no time had passed even though I was out for two hours I woke up and thought it had maybe been 10 mins max.

After that literally all I can think about is my ex girlfriend she was the most important person on the planet to me she‚Äôs a year older than me so she‚Äôs in college and that college party really fucked me up because I know that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs doing. Keep in mind she‚Äôs the main reason I do drugs is to get away from her in my head most people would say wouldn‚Äôt you care more about your mother and to that I would say no. The women treated me like absolute shit my whole childhood and now says to me her happiness is much more important to her than mine and that will never change basically she‚Äôs a horrible human being but it still does hurt because she still is my mother and all I want is a normal relationship with her. So my ex was truly the first girl I loved. I had a panic attack because she made her Instagram public and seeing the posts and comments. So that day I felt pretty much fine still smiley except now all my problems are really really in my face. I‚Äôve put a wall up and use drugs to get rid of this pain. That night I take two subs since it had been 3 days since I used them I got very high but still for some reason couldn‚Äôt sleep I kept waking up every hour or two. So I take my baclofen (smart idea right) and I go into this very strange place where my thoughts are scrambled the things I‚Äôm thinking make literally zero sense at all. 

This continues for 3 hours my ocd is also horrible there‚Äôs a song constantly playing in my head and I‚Äôm depressed as hell I haven‚Äôt been this depressed in years I slept that whole day having dreams where I was 7 again about my mother and my ex and cray shit that made no sense at all.

So if you made it through that thank you for reading as you may have noticed I took 60mg of vyvanse today because the depression IS SO BAD I used to put that wall up but it feels like it‚Äôs completely come down and I‚Äôve done shrooms many times so I don‚Äôt really get this at all. WhT were those feelings in my hands? Was I in danger of dying? Why was I twitching? Could I have possibly made my depression come back and flare up from the Dmt? If you could answer that would be great I want to be sober more than I ever have wanted to in my life I just can‚Äôt take it with the depression and all my problems back up in my face. I know I‚Äôm stupid as well probably could‚Äôve died I‚Äôm never doing something like that again trust me. ThNk you for reading and I hope you have a great day any answers to those questions would be really great I don‚Äôt really know anything about DMT.",1571756442.0

After a month long binge I was feeling low the past couple days (literally and metaphorically), and could not find shit and I mean nothing. I got into a fight with my SO over some dumb shit (benzos, you know?), my penance was physical labor over the weekend. Bad enough on its own but add some medium-to-light withdrawals with it and I had one fucky weekend.

A dear old friend came through Saturday night and got me right with some tens but honestly it just made yesterday and today worse.  I spent the past two days waiting and wishing on the only possible connect I have this time of the month, little did I know she's being strung along by another junky on dry runs (one stop they had a gun drawn on them, yikes!). Finally about an hour ago I get the greenlight! I'm so gassed, I count my money up and try my best to look happy but not desperate then she texts, ""this fucker thinks neurontin is pain""...

I'm dead, literally, I commit ritual suicide in the middle of my living room floor. Thankfully I just felt that way and didn't actually disembowel myself. I recompose, pop half a xan and say fuck it time for bed.

So I'm laying here browsing Reddit when I get a call, my connect's boyfriend was fucking with her and they got all the 7.5s I can handle.

Oh joyous day! Now I know some, or most of you, would thumb your nose at 7.5s but I usually stick to 10s with the occasional big boy pill as a splurge to treat myself. 

I guess I just wanted to vent a little and let the universe know I'm glad that today things worked out.

Thanks to everyone here for keeping me entertained whether I'm high or not. This is an amazing community of (mostly) judgement free people that I don't have in real life. God bless those of you fighting for sobriety and those of you fighting for a buzz. I feel both those struggles and hope all of us get the support we need regardless of the form it takes.

If you made it this far thanks for taking the time to listen.

The trial was supposed to be today, however, they [reached a settlement RIGHT before hitting court](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/10/21/771847539/opioid-trial-4-companies-reach-tentative-settlement-with-ohio-counties).

I want to get real opinions from actual opioid/opiate users, addicts, or former addicts. After reading the first short article, which explains how the $50 billion *would* have been divided, do you think that that would be enough? Do you think it should be divided different?

And/or how do you feel about the new settlement of lesser amount? Do you feel there are other stakeholders who should be held responsible? What are your ideas on the solutions to this country's epidemic?

Normally I wld get reds because of all the hype abt how they are better for opioid withdrawal and it's not true; while some have more energizing effects than others I've noticed it only matters if you get good kratom not a color red gren ect. 

     I have been abusing m30 presses(fentanyl) for abt 4 months and abt roughly 2 to 3 pills a day. While withdrawaling I took different types and brands of kratom and I wld say 65% of them did jack shit. Now I've found one that almost 90% alleviates my withdrawal. Yes I know kratom has a withdrawal too but much safer and wont send my life spiraling down. 

       I actually slept last night on this brand of kratom and I am 2 days in and shld be pretty close to experiencing the worst but I feel fine. This must really be some strong kratom because fent withdrawal is no joke. It's tough and relatively quick. The full fent withdrawal for me was about 5-7 days but primarily you feel better on day 5 but there are still lingering withdrawal symptoms. 

      Moral of the story is talk to people and research which kratom is worthy for use before purchasing  I'm so incredibly thankful that this brand of leaf is literally fixing me up enough to work(and I work for a moving company) brutal but with kratom I can actually go to work. 

       Please tell me your kratom experience for use during withdrawal whether it's good or negative I wld just like to know if it helps others as much as it is helping me right now as I type this.

So i know there they also have the 120mg and i have had 2 boxes of them before (trade with meds of mine & my gf). But then today i was browsing and i was looking now at oxycodon. Couldn't believe my eyes but yes the 160mg is also still available !! I never saw it and i now asked a friend from over the border in NL and hope on a good reply tomorrow. Here in Belgium the highest we have and my gf gets is just the 80mg.

What i also want to ask...People from other places in the EU or from all over the world...Do you know your country's meds database?? If so could you have a look and look up the oxycodon product you have available?? And if so what's the highest dose?? Many in the EU have also 120mg oc's Mundipharma but maybe also 160mg???

(it's for chronic pain so please I really need advices since my quality of life is going really down),"TLDR at the end. 

Hi guys, I suffer from chronic neck pain and used to take 10mg + 5mg of OxyContin until two fucking idiots took 20 pills each other with alcohol and died and now pharmacies don't recieve OxyContin 5mg anymore (I really don't understand why, but ok).

10mg of Oxy didn't help me really much, since being ER I take only 5mg (which is the lowest dose for an adult as far as I know) every 6 hours and I developed a tolerance, 15mg ER (so 7,5mg every 6 hours) used to really help me and make my life a bit better.

Where I live 15mg OxyContin doesn't exists, there's only oxycodone + naloxone 15mg but it makes me hyper irritable and nauseous and taking it would make me whitdrawl (that's wath the instruction sheets of this meds say, and I understand why since naloxone is an antagonist but it's strange since it has only a 0,1% of oral bioaviability).

Anyway, I want to lower my tolerance to oxycodone without stopping taking opioids, would switch to another opioid, maybe a less potent one or one that acts on different receptors help lower my tolerance?

I still, do not have a diagnosis for my problem, even if I did x-ray, MRIs, blood tests and electromyography (if someone has suggestions for another test I would be really grateful, since my only option right now is a fibromyalgia test).

Paracetamol and NSAIDs don't help me at all, only muscle relaxants as Valium with a NSAID (indomethacin in my case) or Oxy help a bit, but I'm pretty sure my problem have nothing to do with my muscles since I've done lots of type physiotherapy but didn't help me at all.

What should I do to lower my tolerance? Today is one of the worst day I've ever had, on a scale from 1 to 10 my pain as I woke up was a 10, after taking oxy, indomethacin and Valium my pain turned into a 7.

So, how can I lower my tolerance without taking opioids? If that's not possible, do you have any suggestions? Maybe going with weed (which helps only sometimes) and Valium (which should mask withdrawals) for the time I need to lower my tolerance can be a good idea? I really need help, sorry if the post is confused and badly, written but english is not my first language and I'm suffering a lot.

I will appreciate any suggestions, regarding possible tests to do and regarding the tolerance question.

TLDR: undiagnosed chronic neck pain, used to take 15mg OxyContin but now I can only take 10mg, I need to lower my tolerance, possibly without stop taking opioids, any, suggestions will be appreciated, regarding tolerance and possible tests to do.

Long story short: I made a post about 2 weeks ago about going to my sisters place for 1 week to completely detox from my 2g/day habit. I had around 30mg klonopin with me and this is how it went:

I got there sunday night and woke up Monday morning wit horrible WD symptoms. I thought to myself, what kind of hell I got myself into... it was pure hell. I took like 25mg klonopin that day, which didn't do shit. Not a single minute of rest this day/night.

On tuesday morning I began to beg my friends to bring me some, just a little methadone or anything to make this abnormal pain go away. But all day, nothing. Noone was willing to be part of my relapse, which I was super pissed off of then, but I was understandable towards them. I fought through tuesday day/night and managed to get to wednesday morning. 

At around 08:00 AM in the morning, no rest for the past 48 hours, deep pain, vomiting, diarrhea and every possible WD symptom you could imagine I said fuck it. I got up, crippled to the train station and took the 2 hour ride home to relapse.

At around 09:00 AM I relapased. I couldn't handle the pain anymore. I was seriously about to take my fucking life. I thought, rather relapse than die today. And that's what I did.

My family became suspicious after all of that. The last 6 months I told them I was sober and they actually trusted me. Then I told them the truth. Everything. How deep I was trapped in addiction and everything else. It broke their heart, but they offered all the support they could give me, as long as I would seek professional help immediatly and get clean. 

I told them about methadone and how I will check into the programm to stay away from the heroin. They are clueless about and were totally upset about the route I planned to take. For them, methadone is exactly the same as heroin, and the only way to be clean is a rehab center.

Well, I said fuck it. Support or not, tomorrow, on monday I have a date with the methadone doctor and will be put on methadone. I plan to attend meetings and see a good psychiatrist aswell.

I was in rehab 3 times already. Everytime it only got worse after I got out, so I see methadone as the only option that will truly help.

I'm optimistic, I'm glad I stood for myself and chose to go my own way. I'm excited about trying the MAT. Wish me luck fellow friends.

Have a nice day, stay healthy and peace out. Thanks for reading.",1571573838.0

30 days ago, I entered a medication-assisted treatment facility offering Suboxone.  If you don't want to check the posts above, I entered because I had then-recently got arrested for a misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charge, after already being on probation for a prior misdemeanor drug paraphernalia charge. 

I slipped up 13 days into my Suboxone journey.  I had stopped taking Suboxone for a day with the intention of using heroin.  Day 13 - 14, I used.  I went to my weekly MAT doctor visit, as planned, ready to continue on Suboxone despite relapsing.  I have remained on Suboxone since without any opioid-related transgressions, making it 16 consecutive full days as of just a few hours ago -- as of Saturday at 11:59 p.m.

I feel good on Sub, better than I did while using.  I have not gone to any NA meetings since relapse.  Attending would certainly help, I concede, but I don't think they help me.  I can't talk about opioid-related problems or Suboxone-specific/MAT-specific problems in NA, I don't care much for it...  It doesn't give me a platform from which I get feedback -- or even the pleasure of sharing personal info out loud.

This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. I've been in touch with spinderella69, and she asked me if I would post a message from her. I said sure, it's the least I can do. I copy/pasted and it is exactly as she wrote it. Here it is.

Hey all! First off, I want to thank all of you who have posted on some of the threads about me wishing me well, and offering me support. It means the world to me, and I appreciate it so much, from the very bottom of my heart. I was really blown away by the all the love and caring I was shown. I want to say thank you for that.

Now, I want to briefly explain what happened. I am banned from a sub that I will not name. I originally banned the head mod of that sub from r/stims for spamming his sub after I asked him to stop. In return, he banned me from that sub. That mod and myself have bumped heads several times since, and admittedly, we don't like each other. I did remain friendly with a couple other mods from that sub though, and was told that I could post there on an alt, that they thought it was dumb that I was banned from there to begin with. And I admit, I did do just that. No one cared about it until I recently made a new sub called r/BetterBenzedrex. After I made that sub, there was quite a bit of drama with the other sub. And low and behold, they reported me for ban evasion. And the admins banned my account for it. Now, I fully acknowledge I violated the rules. I shouldn't have done that, and I take responsibility for my actions. I also want to just add, that I wasn't spamming that sub or anything on my alt. I was trying to answer peoples questions, and help correct terribly unsafe information that I saw posted repeatedly on that sub. My intentions we're good, all I was trying to do was help people, and promote harm reduction.

I love this community, and all the other communities I was active on. I love helping people, and promoting harm reduction. Doing this has given me a sense of purpose, and also helped me maintain sobriety. I received a lot of love from people and I met some truly amazing people along the way. I can't thank you all enough for allowing me to be a mod of this community. I was so very honored to do it, and to share my life with you guys. I know it sounds dumb, but having this taken away from me has really been devastating. My heart hurts because of this.

Now, my IP was not banned, I use several different layers of protection when accessing Reddit. Just my account was. But I wont be coming back on alt, like some people posted in the thread about my ban. It would only be a matter of time before I pissed someone off (and ya'll know I would!) and someone reported my alt to the admins, and they banned it, and I would be back at square one, again. I also lost all the creative control of all the subs I made personally, and regaining it is a huge process. I did send a few emails to the powers that be asking that they reconsider, but I don't think that they are going to do that. The only way I will be back is if they reinstate my account. Otherwise, consider this my farewell.

I just want to say that I always comment to people that they need to accept the consequences of their actions. Don't blame your poor choices on anyone else, at the end of the day, you, and only you are responsible for the choices you make. I made the wrong choice, regardless of how well meaning I was, and now I have to accept the consequences. And I do. And I do it with a very heavy heart.

I love all you, and I thank you all for the love (and the hate too) I received over all these years. It helped me through tough times, and helped me grow, and I am so grateful for that. Remember, do a test shot/line first, carry Narcan, and get a test kit and use it!! I wish you all nothing but the best! Be strong, be kind, and please be safe!!!!!!

Love you! Spin",1571541154.0

dkeeue,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/dkeeue/my_doctor_finally_decided_to_let_me_start_on_a/,13,https://redd.it/dkeeue,MicahOP,My doctor finally decided to let me ¬´ start ¬ª on a regimen...,"I‚Äôve been suffering from worsening, chronic pain for about 9 months. I‚Äôve been awaiting surgery since my first MRI results came back 3 months ago. I was only prescribed Lyrica and muscle relaxants. I added Kratom to that and then I started getting Oxy off script.
 I survived thanks to that for the last few months while somehow achieving to keep my tolerance as low as possible. Up until 3 days ago I was taking 10 to 30 mg at night. Most might never over 20.
 I used potentiators such as grapefruit and antihistamines, combined with my prescribed Lyrica to maximize the effect of low doses. My routine was to start with my meds, the potentiators then 10mg Oxy at once and then a few pieces of 5mg every few hours till I slept. My main goal is pain relief but my current health condition has affected my life and depression so the recreational effects wer more than appreciated. The 10 mg would kick in super nice and give me a very decent high even after months on that routine. A nice warmth sedation  followed by stimulating effects where I would actually feel really productive for a bit. I usually ‚Äúnod‚Äù a bit after the last 10 mg.... anyways....
I had to lie to my doctor this week when my most recent MRI convinced him it was time to prescribe me. He believes I have no tolerance so we are meant to refill/adjust every 10 days... he started me on morphine sulfate at 10 mg 3 times a day.... 
i don‚Äôt feel anything, no pain relief, no effect... i guess that was expected. At best I think it‚Äôs saving me from mild withdrawal...I ran out of Oxy and can‚Äôt afford them at the moment so I want to commit to the regimen with my doctor. My pain issue is chronic and degenerative and the wait time for my surgery is still months away....
What the hell should I do? Today I tried to though out the pain for the day so I could take the 30 mg at once at night but still nothing and no pain relief... is morphine really this weak? Should I just though it out until he has me on a higher dosage or switches me over to something else? don‚Äôt intend on using IV or taking my whole script and running out.... any suggestions outside of that is welcome.",1571542688.0

Normally I take anywhere between 60-80mg IR oxycodone 1x a month, just normal swallowing. Last Sunday I had 80mg and it felt great. Today I took 90mg but instead of swallowing I chewed the pills this time. Wanted to experiment to see if it would be stronger, etc.

Unfortunately, the high is pretty meh.... Im not really that high at all really. These are the same pills I have always taken.

Is it possible I lost a lot of the oxy through chewing? If anything I don't see why it would be weaker than swallowing.

Maybe because its only been 6 days since the last time I got high, instead of my normal month break, I have a bit of a tolerance?

The pills are 10mg  oxycodone hydrochloride. Pink and with a ""k 56"" imprint.

I dont get wds at all because i chip, so what will happen? Even if it knocks whatever off my receptors i shouldnt be sick or anything. Will i even feel the sub work because of that tiny bump?

Anyway does anyone think plugging is a bit overrated I've got good nods before but it wears off fast and leaves me feeling shit . Everyone says oral is a waste but if I take stomach acids pills and a bit of food I feel nice. I bought 300ml oramorph. For 25quid feeling good today on top of my 160mg.

Pros
Relaxing amazing pain killer
Good duration up to seven hours compared to oxys four
Does give energy to get things done
If injected besides heroin the ultimate high
Plugging is good but unreliable imo especially as it not good practice everyday due to constipation

Cons
Bad bad constipation compared to oxycodone
The extended pills don't seem to hit you as good as oxycodone  have to crush them up but may just be my tolerance.
Can be very sedating and make you lethargic
40perdent max oral bioavsbility

A little history when I overdosed and went to the ER a couple days ago they told me my blood sugar was extremely low (which didn't make sense because I've never had this problem in my entire life). they gave me orange juice and soda which didn't improve my blood sugar level so they kept me overnight and put an IV in me with sugar water and i was discharged the next day. The last couple days I went the entire morning and afternoon without eating anything then by night I would begin shaking uncontrollably until I went down to McDonald's and bought a soda which help a little and stopped the shaking. 

Could that episode on the toilet be blood sugar related or did I simply have a minor overdose ?  Or did I just fall asleep ?

I've almost got caught on two separate occasions but will share the best one. This happened about 6 months ago. About a month before my current clean date (minus lil kratom).  

The day started waking up sick, of course. My plug's phone has been off  for two days and I got fed up of my last middleman fucking me over. I lay in bed, losing my mind on YouTube until 3.  I'm dreading going to work at 6. You know when you contemplate calling out over and over, and what you're going to say, even though you usually never call and just end up showing up.   Half hour later my text sound goes off and I immediately get those endorphins firing by just hearing that sound in hope. An old middleman (whos fucked me over as well) hits me up and says if i hurry hes got me.  Hastily i hop in the car and make my 45 minute drive. 

As I get closer to my destination my wds are less severe. I'm still sweating but my anxiety and pain is nearly gone with the anticipation of my next hit. I get there and wait for my middleman guy to arrive. Which is a good sign because I know its actually coming and he doesn't already have it and messed with it.  Things go smoothly and 5 minutes later the foil in my hand shakes as I blast away. Where i live i only get powder, yet I still ritually smoke it like how i started on the other coast. Right away I taste the fent. It still has a little marshemellow taste but more chemical. Instantly pupils pin out, eyes stop watering, euphoria rushes in and I feel like i did when I was 13 and life was 'nornal'. I chat with my friend and 5 mins later hop in my car to go to work. As I pull out of his complex I apparently black out and run over a no parking sign. I awake with him and my neighbor knocking on my window asking if I'm ok. I didn't feel like I passed out so i argued I was looking at my phone. The neighbor was pissed and on his phone. I back up my car and my friend and I bend the sign back up. Ends up neighbor is on the phone with cops. I kinda freeze up initially but soon acted like I was okay with that and was just tsliing and apologizing to the neighbor. In what felt like 3 mins a cop car rushes in the complex and he gets out and immediately put me in cuffs. I act confused, which I was, but he was being an asshole and starts searching me. In my pocket I had roughly a .2 in a sandwich bag and my used foil. He asks if it's heroin. i reply well no its a synthetic opioid and an analogue of something. He gets even more pissed as he puts me in the back of the car. 

Another cop car soon comes and i continue to sit in the car for awhile. The initial cop comes in the car and lectures me about my poor choices and how I'm making him late for his wifes dinner. I'm already playing the conversation of my mom and I in my head and how I explain my first felony, while shes thought ive been clean the past year. I've already accepted my fate. And think to myself that ""at least ive been sick the past 2 days soo my wd in jail wouldnt be too bad"". Suddenly the cop gets a phome call from the cop parked right next to us and I hear he doesn't have enough for it to pass the drug swab test! The other cop sighs and tells me to go buy a lottery ticket after this. He let's me go and i walk away with my stomach upside down. I end up getting a careless driving ticket and he doesn't see or say anything about the open container in my car or other paraphernalia. I get to work 30 mins late. And had a good day.

To this day im still not sure what happened. I assume he tested the foil (which was already burnt and nothing on there). Maybe the fent fill out of the sandwich or he didn't see it..idk. Usually my bags comes in a little bag or foil. Good thing it came in that sandwich bag.. That scared me for a little while but ended up using for another couple weeks and finally quit after getting an opportunity to move and get it a job.

I‚Äôve been sober off opiates for a few years now. I own a landscaping company that I run part time with my partner and I have really enjoyed this past season of work. I hired a really cool Mexican a few months ago and though there is a major language barrier, we get on great. He has few actual friends (only speaks Spanish) and misses his family a lot. Me and him were talking the other day and he asked me if I was looking to make some extra cash....I mean who the hell isnt?? However I kinda knew what he was getting at so I told him I was....he tells me to drop by his house that night and we would talk about ‚Äúgood business.‚Äù

I stop by his place after we get off and on the table was two bags of a tan colored powder and a bag of very strong smelling BLack tar. These are not small bags either ladies and gents....50 g bags of each. We get to talking and using google translate to communicate and he tells me that he only sells 25g minimum. How the fuck am I going to afford that shit?! I don‚Äôt have 1k to waste on starting a small black market business!!! 

I tell him I can‚Äôt afford either. 1k for the BTH and 1500 for the #4....not going to happen. I ask if he can sell me samples of each instead...he says sure no problem. Hands me an OZ of each....‚Äùpay me when you can, take your time hombre. I trust you.‚Äù 

Uhhhh....what the fuck?! I don‚Äôt need this much! I try pushing it back to him and he refuses and basically explains that he works for me as a front. He doesn‚Äôt need the job for money and just needs it for cover. The Two ‚Äúsamples‚Äù are %50 off and I can pay him whenever I want. This shit doesn‚Äôt happen to people like me. He tells me I‚Äôve been good to him and he wants to be good to me. (Pays off to be a kind person sometimes). I cooked him dinner the week before this at my home and he was really touched that I cared for him enough to make spaghetti from scratch. I was a little moved by his gratitude at dinner. 

I went home and tried both the following weekend (on subs so I hopped off them, 2 mg a day). Wow...the BTH is amazing. No added cut.  When it burns it‚Äôs clear trails on the foil...he said it wasn‚Äôt cut but I also was skeptical. The #4 is beyond better than any powder I ever tried, which was usually cut to shit when I did try it and made my nose hurt like a mofo. It is cut with a benzo however. No fent in either, tested and I sent a sample to my buddy who I went to college with (biochem engineering for myself and he was straight chem engineering) and they are both very close to pure besides the side products from synthesis in the BTH and said benzodiazepine in the #4. 

I‚Äôve only used each one time and am doing it again tonight then going back to my subs but I wanted to share with everyone what a crazy amount I was given by this guy at so cheap...and a fucking front!!! 

Does anyone else relate or have a similar story? I am well aware this is a slippery slope with chipping etc. hence why I am going back to subs and not really looking to start this shit again. Just wanted to try both this weekend and last. 

Be safe and please test your dope for fentanyl. This is a throwaway btw.

Edit: I paid off the 1250 I owed him today from my savings to just have it be done with. Forgot to mention that.

Edit 2: trying to post on opiate church but it keeps failing. Not sure what I‚Äôm doing wrong.  Also this is just a post to tell how crazy it is this happened to me. This isn‚Äôt a classified to find customers. 

The guy I got this from comes from money in Mexico. He‚Äôs not part of a cartel and works with a small network he built here and a few other states. He invested in the business by buying opium and either refining it to morphine then H or making BTH. As some of you know it‚Äôs not difficult in the least, especially in some parts of Mexico if you have the money. 

Also if he was cartel I wouldn‚Äôt have bought anything in the end or taken the front. I want to post pictures but can‚Äôt on opiate church it won‚Äôt let me.

This post may drag on and I might start crying while writing it. That‚Äôs how I know that something is not right. 

I am a recently graduated law student who just sat for the Bar exam on July. After 3 months of full time studying I decided I would get some Oxy from a buddy and binge for a bit and enjoy having the Bar exam behind me. I did Oxy a couple times a week, usually never back to back for what I thought would only be a month. 

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve been picking up every two weeks and using multiple times each week. I‚Äôm not fully addicted but I‚Äôm well aware of what‚Äôs happening. The biggest problem for me right now is the depression. I wake up every day and dread going into work. I count down the hours until I‚Äôm back home with my wife. I‚Äôve broke down crying in my office several times over the last few weeks and for the first time in my life I‚Äôve thought, even if briefly, about how death would at least end all this sorrow. 

My sex drive is very low. Motivation is low. Energy is low. I‚Äôve stopped going to the gym and I just feel this heavy weight on my heart every single day. It feels like every morning it all starts again. I haven‚Äôt stopped using because now I‚Äôm using in order to mask this depression. 

I never thought that depression would be the result. I always expected WD and the typical anxiety and sickness for a week or two and that would be it. Is my depression caused by my Oxy use? I thought depression wouldn‚Äôt hit until after you stopped using, yet here I am still using and depressed as fuck. How do I make it out? Is there any hope? How long do we have to tolerate just coping every damn day? I feel like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm fully confident that I can stop using and get through it but I‚Äôm afraid of the depression getting worse. If I wake up in a month and I‚Äôm a month clean and yet still depressed I can‚Äôt imagine what negative thoughts will enter my mind then.

It‚Äôs such a vicious cycle. You are depressed because you use and you use because you are depressed. Oxy feels like the problem and the solution. 

I‚Äôm lost. I need someone to talk to who has been there before. Is it too late for me? Will I ever feel like myself again?",1571407989.0

Got all four wisdom teeth taken out, and that HO of a dentist gave me EXTRA STRENGTH... drum roll please...wait for it...WAIT FOR IT... Ibuprofen. How very considerate of that wench to steal my teeth, only to leave me with a throbbing, bloody mouth. Truly a Grinch if I've ever seen one, except by the end of the procedure, neither of us were singing. Whatever, I've got dozens of 20mg Adderall IR next to my PC, each of which ARE singing ""eat me, snort me, enjoy me, regret me later!""

Luckily, the Tooth Fairy observed this heinous crime committed by the dentist with disbelief, and came to my rescue with fair compensation (my wholesome, Korean gf with a sympathy blowjob). The irony? No teeth! :D

Kids, The moral of the story is; if you can't find your drugs, find some sex. If you can't find some sex, beat off. If you've got no hands, ask your sister to put some headphones on your head and blast some rock n' roll. If god decided to get drunk back in '<I*nsert birthyear Here>*, accidentally pissed on your mother's pregnant belly, and you were born without ears?.... it's time to just fucking use the only two healthy limbs you've got, walk your ass to the nearest cluster of detergents, grip a bottle with your nubby arms (If you can't, ask your sister for help), and start chugging. Because without drugs, sex, and rock'n'roll? Life ain't worth livin. And if you believe in heaven? You're going to hell; you just fuckin forgot to repent and offed yourself, what a selfish POS... but it's ok. It's OK.

Everything will be ok, child. Because there's someone waiting for you with open arms. Only, both those arms have needles in it and he's currently passed out by the infamous ""Lake of Fire"" in a puddle of his own shit and piss. His name? Yep. You guessed it. Satan. This SOB is so shitty at his job that he's not even there to greet newcomers and potential members/prospects of the council of darkness? Smh. This is probably why the council is scrambling to hide the Narcan from Beelzebub and Jefferey Dahmer (Satan's right hand men, total fucking suck-ups); every time Satan wakes up from a binge, it's either one of them claiming, ""Ohhh, ohhh! Satan! This time it was me! I brought the Narcan, lord. Oh master. I'M HERE FOR YOU SIRE, that's what TRUE servants are for!"", while the rest of the council wants him dead. Yes, deader than dead, and sent back to heaven (he really is a good guy deep down, just irresponsible and misunderstood).

Satan welcomes you with open arms, this time no needles and his arms covered by an American Eagle hoodie, bought by your's truly. Yep, I died of an overdose while writing this, bearing gifts as a bribe for good standing with the council. Did you bring gifts? No? Satan looks at me...then you...then finally back to me and says, ""You there! What is your name?"". ""I go by fowwest74 on reddit and most of my other internet accounts, and games and stuff, Sire. Oh lord all-mighty Satan, please have mercy on my soul!"" Pretty scary shit because he just keeps staring at me until I get locked in some form of ritualistic hypnosis, where I get lost in an infinite plane of darkness for what seemed like an eternity. Just darkness. Everywhere. Not a speckle of light, not a sound to be heard except for the own thoughts in my head. How long has passed? Months? Years? Centuries? When isolated in complete darkness (or really any kind of physical sensation for a certain period of time), time ceases to exist. It's irrelevant. ""SNAP!""

""You understand now child?"" Satan asks. ""Yes, oh ruler of the underworld, my mentor, my dragon of knowledge whom I will chase into the darkest crevices of existence to obtain thy wisdom. I understand what it is to be, and not to be."" Satan goes on to say, ""Then you will understand this..."", and hands me a syringe, spoon, and bag of ""brown sugar"". I gather the courage to ask, ""Satan, if you're the almighty ruler of the underworld, controller of demons and all that is evil, then why can't you afford the purity of 'white china'?"" To this, our new ruler replies with a light heart, ""This isn't heaven my good friend! Ahh, you're greediness is refreshing and certainly something to be desired by many of my followers. Yet another lost soul. Come now. You and I have plans to formulate for the future of my kingdom. I believe a fresh new set of eyes is exactly what the council has been lacking."" He pats me on the back and dishevels my hair in a friendly manner. It's hot to the touch, but worth it. Of course he is someone to be feared. Compliance is not a choice; his hypnosis won't let me forget... but could this be the start of something beautiful? A new chapter to my life of highs and lows? Only time, continuous drug abuse, and ever-changing participation in meaningless sex, in hell, will tell.

I can see Jeffery Dahmer's jealousy starting to come out in the forms of whimpers and sweat, at which point he begins to devour the flesh off Beelzebub's face, screaming, ""Now Beelzebub and I will become one! There's no way my lord can deny such a perfect concoction of ill-will! Certainly now I am able to fulfill his requirements for a trustworthy adviser; someone who treads through every footprint of his majesty, offering nothing but contribution to his well-being, and retribution to all that is holy!"" As Jeffery is fixated on his meal, Satan urges me away from the Lake of Fire, and towards the unbearable heat of the fiery gates that lead to the outskirts of the capital. These flames were blue, and inflicted an encapsulating pain that no mortal could withstand without losing consciousness. I truly was in hell. But like any feeling, one eventually becomes desensitized, and I had all eternity to do so; worry was far from my mind. Only curiosity, screams of the damned, and the Devil were guiding me at this point.

Oh yah? I forgot about you? ""AND YOU!!!"" Satan roared as he spun 180 degrees, pointing his finger to where you use to stand. ""Where did my new test subject go?!""¬†

Child, you've been lucky and not so lucky in this life and the next. Word is down here, you were rushed by the paramedics to the nearest hospital. You're stomach was pumped just in time for resuscitation to occur. You were pronounced dead over the course of 4 minutes, and have gone to hell and back. Unfortunately, not only do you have no drugs, no sex, no hands, no ears, and no taste for rock'n'roll. You're now hooked on permanent dialysis. It's up to you now. Will you stay and endure the pain of being a useless vegetable with the inability of achieving any sort of pleasure or happiness? Or will you give it another shot in hell? There's no repenting now. You've already been tainted by the toxicities ousted into hell's atmosphere by it's inhabitants and foreign plant-life. God really can be a dick sometimes, because whether it be today, or tomorrow, you and Satan will cross paths again. And when that happens, idk, just buy him something nice like I did and win his favor. Just not American Eagle (I'm wearing American Eagle jacket rn, it's gotten me through one cold, drug-induced trance of night, lol). That's copying He'll see right through that. Hopefully he was too hungover and crashing to remember your face by the time you return, and he'll give you a chance as a member of the council. I've absolutely no clue what he was planning to do with you, but ""test subject"" didn't sound too friendly. Anyways, I'm hungover and crashing rn too, so gn y'all, or gm either way.

Yes we know lucky bastards in the EU, old school is still the current school in yalls school. Haha, however,


Iirc (and anyone curious I suggest you DO NOT do this, it's so unhealthy and IV without proper HR is probably still safer than this) people used to actually smoke the IR OC80s?

Did that shit actually work? This is purely from a curiosity standpoint as my only pill usage was really vics back in the day when I even *did* pills.

But I swear I heard it from more than one source that's the only way theyd do it was to smoke it, on paper it seems like a great idea, however binders and fillers and even pill dye etc make it a bad idea.

Just wanted to inquire with some people that may have used that substance when it was around in the US, or for people in the UK who would possibly still be doing it.


tl:dr: theoretically can you smoke OC80s? Did people? And if so does it actually work or is it a placebo thing like people who snort  benzos?

3. the pills were doing shit taking too many to work and when they would work itd be like a blackout
4. addictiveness. point blank, fentanyl is so so much more addictive and prone for compulsory redosing than oxycodone

I remove the glass and for filtering I use a rag that I double up and and place on top of another glass with a rubber band and then pour my hydro thru the rag and into the glass. Now this is the part I'm not so sure about is the gunk at the bottom I try to filter it as well but it usually makes my hydrocodone more cloudy and I usually let it sit on the rag until it dries and doesn't drip no more I then discard the gunk and store my hydrocodone water in my closet.

Thought I was good, lasted like 2 weeks off it and relapsed bad on fent.  So bad that I was throwing up for hours on end bc it was so strong for my new lowered tolerance.  Anyway I‚Äôm getting back on the shot in a couple days and want to issue a couple warnings that I learned the hard way last time.  

1)  if you‚Äôre going to ease WD‚Äôs with Kratom make sure you stop 5ish days before your shot or it will put you into precipitated WD.  I didn‚Äôt think it would but it def does.  

2) if you‚Äôre going to take Lope for the runs or big doses to stop WD make sure you quit taking it about a week before your shot.  I was taking a relatively small amount (14-16mg per day) daily up until the day of my shot.  Got my narcan challenge dose and was ok so I agreed to the vivitrol shot.....on the ride home 45 mins later my stomach started cramping pretty bad.  I thought it was no big deal and then about 1 hour after my shot I had to be taken to the ER bc I literally couldn‚Äôt get out of the fetal position bc my stomach was cramping so hard it felt as if someone was taking a chainsaw to my stomach.  It was brutal and lasted about 8 hours and even was bad after the meds they gave me in ER.  

So if you‚Äôre going to get vivitrol def stop regular opioids for 7 days but I would highly recommend stopping lope / Kratom as well 

For those that don‚Äôt know why lope causes this reaction is bc it‚Äôs an opioid that only binds to opioid receptors in the stomach.  (Well unless you take insane doses then it will cross BBB but that‚Äôs a whole nother topic)",1571322186.0

I did a CWE on 100 t1s, which have 8mg codeine, 15mg caffeine, and 300mg APAP, and about 400ml of water.

After dissolving the pills, I put the solution in the freezer for an hour, then filtered it through coffee filters and got 3 separate cups going at the same time.

I froze what I got out of that, refiltered it, froze it for 35 minutes again, filtered it again, then left it in a fridge overnight.

However, to speed things up, I added a bit of water to each filter cup, which was fucking stupid of me.
I ended up with 640ml of water. It was translucent, but had a slight tint to it.
 I drank half of the fluid.

It was fun, but nauseating, and around 4 hours after the peak I started vomiting a bunch. I then got super anxious, and still am, about having potentially od'd on APAP. It's been around 10 hours since my first dose, and I'm wondering whether or not I need to go to the hospital. I also think I might just be panicking and vomiting from metric shit tons of caffeine also.

Doing a lot of reading I saw that APAP is soluble at 14mg/ml at the temperatures I was doing the filtration at most of the time, meaning that I probably only ingested around 4.5g of APAP, which while not good, isn't life threatening.

Question is, am I gonna fuckin die? Did I fuck it up?

Also, I'm well aware that I really fucked up and am very stupid, I need to know if I'm going to die first before I worry about that though, thanks.",1571289626.0

This batches powder comes out of the bag in slabs almost and is pure white also, it breaks up into beads with some powder but not as fine. (Is it possible that it is effected by humidity/sweat as my middle man held onto it for 2 days) it tastes sweet.

Did I simply go from a bomb ass batch to a bunk batch & is this stuff considered ECP?

To summarize...I‚Äôve been kicking a 300mg-450mg daily Oxy habit. Been using since 2013. I‚Äôve had success detoxing and staying sober for a decent amount of time, all things considered. 

I‚Äôm obviously addicted, but have done a relatively decent job at managing my addiction.  I turned 40 at the end of this last July.  I said that‚Äôs it.  I‚Äôm going to detox/withdrawal and take minimum 6 months before contemplating if I want to repeat this ‚Äúwash, rinse, repeat‚Äù addict cycle.

So I was on day 4 cold turkey and knew the worst of the physical part was behind me.   I was very excited to get thru the acute withdrawal symptoms and was looking forward to being clean for a while. 

Sooooo....I applied to my dream job 6 months ago, I went thru 3 rounds of interviews (all the while clean...i did not want to fuck this up) and I get an email and phone call from the VP of sales saying she‚Äôs reviewed my resume and spoke with the panel who sat in my interviews.  Everything was perfect...I‚Äôm the perfect candidate they‚Äôre looking for EXCEPT I don‚Äôt have enough time doing B2B sales.  The majority of my experience was outside sales.  So there went that...or so I thought.    

I was still employed while interviewing for this position so wasn‚Äôt totally dependent on getting the new job for income...but I did wanted that B2B position.  So I created a way to gain B2B experience with my current employer, reached out again to my dream job, and they were impressed enough by the initiative I took to teach myself that they told me to come interview again in Jan 2020...they will have many opportunities then.  I reached out to them end of September...they told me to wait until January... so I went back on my stupid use and withdrawal cycle thinking ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine...just have to detox around thanksgiving and I‚Äôll be good if an opportunity happens early 2020.

Wouldn‚Äôt you know it?  I get a call from one of members of my second interview panel from when I first applied.  They said they had an opening and they think I‚Äôd be the perfect fit. They want me to come in to discuss directly with the VP of sales, almost like a 4th interview.  And, of course, when I receive this call, I‚Äôm on day 4 of detoxing...it was this past Monday. They want me to come in the next day.  Omg...there is NO WAY I could interview during withdrawals.   Even tho most physical symptoms would be eliminated by then, there was no way i would get hired with the lack of motivation and full on depression that comes with day 5 or an opiates detox. 

I was in a bind.  I wanted to continue to detox, but had this opportunity.   I came into this forum asking for advice and got it.  People here really care and took my request seriously.   Did not get trolled. 
I took their feedback and suggestions.  I picked up just enough for low dosing.   I low dosed about 1/4 of my daily usage the day I picked up to prep for the interview.  Lots of material i had to be able to speak to with confidence.  The next day, I low dosed 1/4 of my normal usage again 2 hrs before my interview. 

The interview went great!   I did make one mistake and i do know it WAS because of the Oxy. I was a little TOO confident and when asked if I had anything i would like  say before we we ended our meeting, I said, 
‚ÄúYes....actually there is.  I‚Äôm perfect for this role because a,b, and c...and I really believe you‚Äôd be making a mistake if you pass on me....‚Äù - WHOOPS!!!   Holy shit...why the fuck did I just say that?   I saw the expression of the entire panel change from pleasant to ‚ÄúThe Fuck?‚Äù

We ended the meeting and we said our goodbyes.  The panel said they would speak amongst themselves and if they wanted to bring me on, they would check my references.   I got the hell out of there fast.   I don‚Äôt know why I felt like running, but I thought carefully about each step so I wouldn‚Äôt start sprinting.  

On the drive home, looking at the estimated miles left of gas in my 2008 Lexus, knowing it was only half of the miles needed to get home, a wave of relief spread over me.  I think I was just relieved to get that over with.  Now the next wave, that wave was not relief.  This wave was angst, guilt, regret and all the familiar emotions that accompany a relapse.
‚ÄúYou dumb motherfucker.  U had the job!!!!  U had it in the palm of ur hand and ur dumbass had to try to make a point.  Why didn‚Äôt u just answer with a simple, ‚ÄòI‚Äôd like to say thank u for ur consideration.‚Äô Whatever the fuck!!!!  But not U‚Äôll regret not hiring me. What is wrong with u?!?  That‚Äôs like asking someone out on a date, being told yah, ‚Äòthat sounds nice‚Äô, and me replying ‚Äòyah u better say yes to my advances.  U‚Äôd be making a big mistake not sleeping with me!‚Äù

Already accepted my fate as I drove home yesterday.  I had no more opiates not any intention on picking up or using any more.  I also missed out on my dream position because of opiates.  Not because I low dosed for the interview, but because I put myself in the position to have to low dose to perform better in the interview.  

I received an email early this am from the company.   

THEY MADE ME A 6 FIGURE INCOME OFFER!!!!!
I GOT THE FUCKING JOB!!!!!

But this is kind of a in the moment story cause I‚Äôve been reaching out to certain people while in this mindset to let them know there‚Äôs freedom outside this.

I was clean for 8 day‚Äôs on this relapse, I was in the 100s for mgs of oxy used a day. (Snorted after the time). On this night I was craving. And on some Xanax which enables a bad side of me if I don‚Äôt get my mind off of cravings. So I let it get to me. Walked to my plug, picked up just 3 perk 10s. 

On the way back I‚Äôm punching myself practically over the thought of reckless I am over my life, I‚Äôm literally clean for 8 days just to relapse on something that won‚Äôt even get me a buzz? I just wanted the crave to go away honestly.. and that‚Äôs where I was wayyy wrong 

I got fucking noddy that night. I was so fucking euphoric I ordered a pizza and 2 salads and ate the whole fucking thing with my gf. (She knew I relapsed she was just there watching live pd with me cause no matter what she‚Äôll be there for me. And that hurt me so bad) 

I ate so much food and smoked my whole pack of cigarettes in about 2 hours. I was literally counting down from 4 hours knowing that‚Äôs how long this enjoyment will last. I nodded out sitting up in my bed on purpose just to get that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fucked up‚Äù feeling. 

The next morning I woke up and she was at school (college) like it was nothing. I got up and felt disgusting with myself. Told myself i wont do that again.. but then exactly at the same time that night I did the same shit. And I got back on. 

That‚Äôs where you can fuck up. Literally cravings for me today are harder than the physical shits and stomach ache I had to feel those 5 days of real withdrawal. I really did type this out of nowhere cause I was talking to someone I met through my last post. 

I‚Äôm still doing good but I think someone out there can understand where I‚Äôm coming from and see my slip before they themselves can. 

Like I said this is a old story but to look back at it now I was an idiot. Is there a thread for people literally battling cravings either? Just wondering",1571272414.0

We are shunned by friends, family, and society but find acceptance within our own community. That is something special that no other sub reddit can say.

I started with my ex wife while we were active addicts in 2008. I kept on shooting up and she stopped in 2012 on a MMP until now, and I think for ever... In 2015 we planned a 1 month long trip to the US from coast to coast..  I had just recently relapsed and didn't even care to start myself on methadone or at least lower the dose... I was an incredibly stupid kid when I was 29... A few days before the trip, we found out she was pregnant...

The flight day came and I was shooting at least  ¬æ or 1  gram a day. I had a stash of about 120 10mg methadones and planned to start that day. Shot up the last thing I had in the airport and left with a pills case full of methadone to avoid going cold turkey... I put it in my wallet pocket and got to the airport in the US without any hassle.   
  
That day I met with my ex wife and her mom who arrived the day before and had a nice day. Went to the outlets and bought clothes and ate good Chinese food.  
  
That night I started puking like a demon was trying to get out of me. It was hell. My wife was super worried and I let her down like never before, and that was not the first time.  
  
I bought a flight to come back home. Called a taxi to take me to the airport and asked the guy to  go to a CVS. When we parked, there was a guy who looked like he could sell me some riding a lowrider bycicle, but he went away. He just said goodbye to another guy in a plaid shirt and jeans in that heat... I got close to the guy and said ""hey man, I'm jonesing pretty bad, could you please hook me up?"" And the guy just nodded and went away... Couldn't buy anything for the vomits in CVS so we kept going to the airport.   
  
Once there I kept on puking and could get to a city in georgia which was the connection flight and they didn't even asked me for what I had in my pocket. Something beeped while going through that x-ray ""door"" and I kinda freaked out a little but nothing happened after I showed my wallet which was still in my pocket. However the guy at the gate didn't let me fly because I was too sick. They gave me another fly the next day and a Holiday inn night with breakfast...  
  
I was so mad at me about not being able to hide that I was withdrawing and the fact I didn't go to the ER in FL... But finally I accepted the ambulance to the ER in GA. There I spent like 8 hours and they stopped the withdrawals.  
  
I got a cab to the hotel and spent the rest of the night eating 2 10mgs every 5 or 6 hours... 

It was still too late to come back to FL, and I didn't have much money left...

I took a plane back home with about 110 pills... Not a single run in with the police.",1571269495.0

I spent a lot of time with them as it was kinda our regular night party house, plus daily deals with them. 

One night I was rolling there idk what they were on but I'm guessing crack or meth. One of them yelled down to the basement for me to come up. Which lead to one of the funniest things i've ever seen.

Iv always had issues with sleep paralysis - waking up before your body wakes up in a vegetative state not being able to move except for wiggling toes/fingers to break out of the episode and sometimes having issues breathing.

Recently, Iv noticed with doing this FentDope these episodes have become more intense and last longer. This morning I woke up in my recliner after nodding out to being stuck for what seemed like 10 minutes smothered into the side of my chair. Whenever I broke out I was indeed face first into my chair... it seems to be happening more often and episodes lasting a lot longer. This FentDope stuff lasts 4-6 hours and I occasionally wake up overnight in mild withdrawal which forces my body to wake up which may be provoking these episodes more.

The one I was on before, Lamictal, killed about 90% of my withdrawals. I'd be mostly fine all day, but RLS would come at night, keeping me awake all night.  And this one occasionally starts working immediately, but a lot of people it takes several weeks to take effect.  So it's probably not the best option for opioid detox.

A lot of anti-convulsants are also used as mood stabilizers, so that's a possible route to get them prescribed if you don't have epilepsy.

I finally divulged to him the truth, and the reasons I lied were because of the stigma and demonization of MAT in the rooms. I wanted to free myself of this lie- I never wanted to deceive anyone in the first place, but my fear got the best of me, until yesterday, when I swallowed my pride and got honest. I wasn't expecting these consequences and now I'm not sure where I want to go from here. He says I cannot start counting myself as clean until I'm off the subs, so basically I'm in active addiction right now which makes no fucking sense at all. If I'm using, then I might as well actually fucking use! 

A sponsor's job is to guide you through the 12 steps and share their experience. He's not going to let me do steps until I'm off subs either, so basically he's just another addict in my network now. He's retarded because he even suggested coming off cold-turkey, which obviously is a moronic idea because that would be unsafe, and increase my chance of actually relapsing on a real drug enormously.

Quit 70 mg Cold Turkey and I'm on day 5 and feel fine.,"    Hey there, I have a question and hoping someone can help. I have been on methadone for 4 years now. I got it from my pain management Doc. Not because of heroin. Never done that.  My dose has been 70 mg a day for 3 years. I also take 4 oxy 10s 4 times a day. I have gone through countless amounts of withdrawals over that time. I have wanted to cut my fucking legs off from the pain and restless legs during some WDs. I've been through some horrible WDs from Methadone. I also get in a very depressed and lethargic mood. Emotional, sweating, liquid shit for days so I know the symptoms well. Also all the sneezing. 

    Well I quit taking it last week. I took 90mg on Thursday and then my last 30 mg on Friday. For some reason this time is different. I'm feeling zero withdrawal symptoms. My WDs have always started 30 hrs after last dose. In September I quit for 11 days. Had bad WDs but took xanax too get through it. Being that I have only been back on them for a month, would that be why I'm not having WD symptoms. 

   I have a bunch of Gabapentin 600mg that I've  been taking. I read that it helps, but could it make me feel zero WD symptoms?  Also I think alot of WD is brought on by our minds panicking for the next dose, or having to wait until a script can be filled. This time I have been smoking some weed when I get a bit anxious and it clears my mind. No worries at all. I really want to be done with it!

    Has anyone had this happen before? I'm o fucking sick of planning my life around pills.  I have had shit happen in the past where I can't do certain things because I either would run out of pills during the trip or because I already took them. I'm sick of that shit.  Last Thanksgiving I wanted to go back home for a visit and I would have ran out of meds on the trip. The Dr. wouldn't approve an early fill on my meds. I didn't want my grandma to see me in WD so I said I couldn't get off work but reality thesel little fucking pills stopped me. Tired of being a slave to pills.  Every month I tell myself that I won't fuck up and run out early but that doesn't happen.

Sorry for the rant. So again has anyone jumped off at a higher dose and not had any WD symptoms?



TLDR.....  Jumped off Methadone at 70mgs a day and having no WD symptoms. Taking a bunch of 600 mg gabapentin and smoking some weed when I'm anxious. Could that be masking the symptoms. Also last month I went 11 days without any methadone. Could that also be why I don't have any symptoms? Being that I have only been back on it for 20 days? 

Any help much appreciated! Sorry for the rant.",1571201149.0

He was all up in my business that day and even walked me to my car and saw me off, so I couldn‚Äôt use at home before leaving like I normally would have done.

So I got reckless and dumb. I guess because it is my hometown I got overly confident. I decided to stop in this shopping center parking lot in my hometown. It was a Tuesday and my hometown is a small, well, town. Not a lot of activity during the day, but just enough that I wouldn‚Äôt stick out. I figured I would be safe here. In this shopping center is an Albertsons, Starbucks, McDonald‚Äôs and some other random little shops. I parked way in the back next to the McDonalds. I parked next to a tree, so the only spot available was the spot next to my passenger door. 

I looked all around and took in my surroundings. Everything seemed good. *\[Now in hindsight I realize I should have just sucked it up and gone into the Albertson's bathroom to use, but I try to avoid it because people from high school who used to bully me work there still. I also knew that the bathrooms in Albertsons and Starbucks required a key or coin to use, and I didn't want to buy anything.\]* So I pushed my car seat back a bit and laid it all out. I use my current cell phone and an old cell phone (that I keep my music on) to crush my pill. So I had that sitting in my lap. Luckily I left the two cell phones stacked on top of each other, so you couldn‚Äôt see the pill powder in between. However I had a rolled up dollar bill and a credit card to the right of my legs in clear sight.

It happened really fast. I was putting the card back in my wallet and a little baggy that has nose rings in it fell onto my lap. But the baggy looks just like a little drug baggy. Right at the moment I got distracted by the falling bag a vehicle pulled up to my passenger side. I looked up and locked eyes with a fucking sheriff deputy. He looked at my lap (where everything was still sitting) and then looked away. I knew I was going to jail. I just knew it. But I acted fast.

I very obviously took a nose ring out of the bag and put it in my nose. I opened my car mirror and checked it out. I wanted him to see what I was doing. Then I grabbed everything in my lap‚Ä¶both phones, the money, the card and dropped it into my purse (losing the pill powder‚Ä¶ugh). Then I got out of my car with as much confidence as I could muster (when in reality my legs had turned into spaghetti noodles and I was shaking from head to toe) and walked into McDonalds. I purchased something to eat, I can‚Äôt even remember what, then went into the bathroom. I railed a line and trashed the rest of my pills (don‚Äôt worry‚Ä¶it was only two).

When I came out I picked a seat next to the window and watched the deputy. He got out of his SUV, leaned over and looked in my car very obviously. He came into the restaurant and spoke to someone who was working there, then came over to me directly. He asked if I had seen some guy and gave me a description. I said no. He locked eyes with me for what felt like an eternity and then eventually nodded at me, turned away and left. I stayed in my seat until he drove away.

I got back in my car only to realize he had just relocated to a different part of the parking lot that now had four other sheriff SUV‚Äôs parked with him. At this point there was nothing left for me to do but leave and just pray no one followed me. So I left...and no one followed me! It was one of the scariest moments I‚Äôve had in a long time. I think he was legitimately there looking for someone else, and that may have saved me. Who knows.

I‚Äôve been on felony probation since 2011 and spent 4 months out of 2011 in jail (three different arrests). I‚Äôve come SO far and been out of trouble for so long. I was extremely mad at myself for breaking my rules and being so reckless. Honestly if I had been arrested I would have deserved it for being such an idiot.

I learned my lesson for damn sure.",1571173383.0

Tramadol, tapentadol and oxy on the other hand are the best 'anti-depressants' I've tried. Makes you wonder.

Story Time!!","So I‚Äôll start this with a very important message - DO NOT EVERY LET YOUR MONEY WALK!!! 

So yesterday I woke up with only the Rez that was caked up in my plastic straw tooter. A decent amount as I was able to get well for a solid 6 hours off of it. Before I smoked it I hit up my dude to reup my usual 2gs. However yesterday was different than most days, my dude didn‚Äôt reply. Typically he is very reliable and will reply within 20 minutes of first contact, more often sooner than 20 minutes. 

As I was completely out of dope I started to panic and called a few times, no response. Finally round noon he hits me back and says he is going to reup and to holler at him in a few hours. 2:30 rolls around and I call, no answer, but i decide to go ahead and drive to the city where I pick up at that time - I‚Äôm starting to get a runny nose and wanted to be able to meet ASAP after he gets it. I live in a town 45 mins away from this city. I drive down and head to the proximity of where we usually meet, still no answer! 

Now at this point I‚Äôm really gettin nervous, I figured if he was at least en route to reup or waiting on his guy he‚Äôd at least tell me what was wassup - we have a really great relationship for strictly dealer/customer interaction. A key piece of this story I need to mention - I ONLY HAVE 1 PLUG and it‚Äôs this dude. Desperation Starting to set in I hit up a previous middle of mine, the one who gave me the connect I‚Äôm not hearing from, to no avail. Scrambling what to do, I come across an old group text my guy had created that included myself and 10 other customers informing us of his new number. 

Feelin ballsy, I text each of those numbers individually askin for some help. Miraculously one comes back saying they were en route to score at that moment and I could tag along, sweet! This is where the age old saying of ‚Äúif it seems too good to be true, it is!‚Äù So I meet up with these people and they‚Äôre younger but seem pretty cool - a dude and his girl, she‚Äôs 24 he‚Äôs 22 and I‚Äôm 29. So I hop in the car with them and we go to meet their guy, however this dude is pulling the typical dealer bullshit and not answering anymore now that we‚Äôre outside of the apartments he supposedly told them to meet him at.

After 30 minutes of driving around sketchily he calls back and says to meet him in a Walgreens parking lot down the street - phew! We get there and no surprise, he goes radio silent again - wtf dude! Now in the mean time I get another reply from someone who was on deck at the time, however I felt committed to my current venture and told the other person I‚Äôd come thru and pickup after my current situation and they were cool with that. After another 45 mins of waiting, right as I‚Äôm about to pull the plug, this dude calls and is actually pulling in right at that moment! Bliss. 

The chick gets out and goes over to his car - this is where it gets sketchy - and chums it up with him for 5 mins and comes back saying he only had .5 on him, but was about to pickup more if we could wait and get well on the .5 in the meantime. We all agree and she goes back to his car to relay the message. She takes another like 10mins in the car with this dude, even smoking in front of me and her dude, possibly explaining to the dealer how they were gonna burn me? 

She comes back and we get well, thank god, and follow dude to a spot where we were gonna wait again while he reup‚Äôd - note he has my cash at this point. Sitting at this new spot for over an hour and I‚Äôm starting to get a bad feeling. I drove myself and they drove themselves soWe could split immediately after but to kill time I chilled in the car with them. Also Note it‚Äôs now 8pm and my girl is about to get off work and I can‚Äôt not be at the house when she gets there or my cover will be blown. So sitting in this car for over an hour now I get a text from the dude in the car asking me if I could go to my car for a min while he gets head. 

WTF dude?? We both know it‚Äôs impossible to nut from head while high. But I oblige and go to my car. I assume they‚Äôre either smoking without me as they had already gotten more than they previously told me was received or just trying to wait me out and see if I‚Äôll just leave at this point. I finally do leave and pickup from the person who hit me up earlier without a hitch and the other two schmoes tell me they left the spot they were waiting due to the dude still not replying. Now all these red flags start to pop in my head. Like how they gave me a solid .2 from the supposed .5 we got to hold us over, or the fact that they didn‚Äôt ask me to break them off when I told them I ended up scoring, or the whole BJ thing, I mean come on! Now this am the dude is still holding true to his tune that he hadn‚Äôt heard from dude.

In my mind I‚Äôm thinkin if it looks like a fuck, quacks like a duck, it must be a duck. But I called him on it last night and this morning giving him a chance to come clean and no dice.

I use Oxy (120mg day) for 1 month - oral or intranasal 

Then I Stop for 3 months

Repeat 1 Month Binge

Etc.

Amazingly, I've stuck to this for over 10 years. 

While using, I break my 30mg oxys into 15 mg and do those. I start first thing in the morning around 6am by  bumping a line, and then do it through the day on a fairly set schedule until my final bumps at 10pm.

I love opiates. But have come to terms with the fact that it's not a sustainable ""all the time habit"". I have a job, wife, etc. 

Anyways, the first day after my month binges are brutal (for me at least). Achy all over, running nose, terrible mental state - just super depressed feeling like a complete asshole, etc. I time it so my first WD day is a Saturday.

I begin the following routine:

Day 1 Clean:

1st thing in morning: 

6g red hulu kratom

2mg gold kratom extract from a great online vendor 

Muscle relaxer - usually 10mg cyclobenzaprine

4mg klonopin 

&#x200B;

Around noon:

Same kratom

1mg klonopin 

&#x200B;

Around 7pm

Same Kratom

2mg klonopin 

10mg cyclobenzaprine

&#x200B;

10pm

6g red hulu kratom

10 mg ambien

Gotta say it feels real good. I honestly was giving up on life at the end there. All I did was get high and stay in bed literally 22 hours a day. If I wasn‚Äôt sleeping I‚Äôd be in bed watching Netflix or on Reddit with the curtains closed. I didn‚Äôt even have motivation to get out of bed besides work 3 hours Friday and Saturday night, and even then it sucked. IOP and therapy have helped a lot more than I thought. I made it 80 days without the help of vivitrol so I honestly think the opiate chapter of my life is behind me. 

I am going to decide if I should start drinking casually again. Everybody I‚Äôve spoken to talks about how bad that can be. I feel the way many addicts do in this situation...‚ÄùI never had a problem with alcohol‚Äù.  I know that‚Äôs a slippery slope and many people can‚Äôt successfully drink ‚Äúnormally‚Äù after an addiction. However, If I had 1 thing to credit my successful sobriety so far it would be that I got sober, tried to use heroin in a controlled fashion, and it spiraled out of control so fast.

Tapered to 1mg (2 weeks ago).  Currently (0.5mg) once in the morning   

Drop from 8mg to 4mg was easy.  Didn‚Äôt notice anything other than I had been wasting strips.  

Drop from 4mg to 2mg was a bit noticeable but after a good month in the gym and time, I feel it became normal enough for me to proceed with my day  

Drop from 2mg to 1mg was more difficult.  You don‚Äôt really notice a difference until the 3rd day and you will noticeably crave suboxone. Maybe some discomfort, but time helped.    

Drop from 1mg to 0.5mg was difficult.

It's my 1 year 'birthday,'  Coincidentally, I have the day off work because it's Sukkot, a Jewish Holiday, and I work for a religious-based company. I actually have today and Tuesday off. Same thing for next week too. Which, in my opinion, is awesome.

So, originally, I was planning on hitting up a meeting I like and taking a cake there, but in all honesty, I've had such a hard time with Narcotics Anonymous that I wasn't feeling it.

Today, was pretty lackluster, but in a good way. Ya know? A buddy of mine promised not to use or relapse today or anytime because it would insult me to do that on my one year or near it in their opinion. I agree and that alone makes me feel really good.

In some ways, I feel like I've accomplished jackshit because I'm on Subutex, and sometimes do need narcotics because of my pain problems with my health and all.

However, when you look at the reality of it, I moved out of my damned parent's house, I'm engaged! I've got a job, and my finances are getting better. To me being clean is more about the transformation of your life than the actual drug. I do see how cutting the drug out helped me transform my world too.

(Also this is more for the advanced users that have been doing this along time or have huge tolerence but there is info for small tolerance issues  in here aswell I‚Äôm kinda barred so I might update this in morning if I even post this mess)

I am making this on mobile so please I‚Äôm trying to keep it look less like a blocks of text so bear with me 

Let‚Äôs start with IVing benzos long story short let‚Äôs make a small list of what we CAN and what we CANT IV

Pharmaceuticals(besides Ativan/Valium/midrazolam(spell check that for me) that are already in IV-IM vials are the only IV able benzo as far as pharmaceuticals and you CANNOT i REPEAT break down pills and suck
Up whatever you can in a rig they are not water soluble and are simply a waste now Librium is water soluble but don‚Äôt bust open the capsule and try to shoot it whatever the fillers are are not and GEL very fast SOME
say ‚Äúwhy not just get ph and use that ?‚Äù In theory sounds great but I‚Äôm not gonna be taking that chance 

FOR THOSE SKIMMING DONT SHOOT BENZO PILLS ONLY OFFICAL PHARMACEUTICAL VALIUM/ATIVAN/MIDAZOLAM 

NOW FOR US POLY-DRUGFOLK WHO DO IT ALL (HERION/FENT/FENTADOPE/TAR/ICE/COKE/CRACK AND ANYTHING ELSE WORTH IV-ABLE) 

If your serious about the benzos don‚Äôt mix them with ANYTHING untill you know how they effect you IV regardless(still talking benzo so far here) ETIZOLAM/CLONAZOLAM/DICLAZAPAM) PG SOLUTIONS FROM
QUALITY AND TRUSTED VENDORS 

THESE ARE THE BENZOS YOU CAN IV SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY 

The good thing is weather you have a tolerence or not benzos have great bio-availability so if 1mg of etiz gets you right do either 0.5 or that 1mg because it‚Äôll all feel the same it just hits faster 

Now the ones with best rush will be (for me is) ETIZ DICLAZ CLONZOLAM others will have varying opinions on this because some say they don‚Äôt have rushes which is just not true .... they have rushes just not extreme ear ringing rushes it‚Äôs very subtle but that benzo feeling is hitting instantly 


Now mixing with other substances like 
H/METH/COCAIN/CRACK BE VERY VERY CAREFULL take your benzo tolly in HALF If not A QUARTER of what you‚Äôd usually use half of what you would use for each other substances

My fav mix 2mg etiz 0.5 diclaz and a half a Dime  of coke or crack(meth if around) with 3 -4 bags of dope( roughly 4 points for west coast folk) 

Now base this info on your tolerence and what you wanna feel most you can always do more not less belive it 

So I‚Äôd say for a first timer that wants to try this with a decent dope habit and no benzo habit is have him put about half his dose (lil
More lil less only you know your tolley) and add the 0.5 of etiz if diclaz 1mg 
Ok so like if you do 4 bags a day and no benz tolly just do 2 and do what‚Äôs above and if you stims add the TINEST amount to it like 00.5 or something 

IF YOU HAVE LITTLE TO NO TO BENZO TOLLY DONT EVEN CONSIDER GETTING IT GET TIZ OR DICLAZ STRAIGHT UP

ALSO AS ALL HARM REDUCTION FOLK SAY THE UKTIMATE WAFEST WAY IS TO NOT DO IT PERIOD

Normally i try to do 1-3 days on with like two weeks off. This time around i got .5g of what is no doubt some fent dope.
  
Day one it felt amazing. Day two and on, its been hell. Cant eat ANYTHING since day 2, so sluggish and sleepy, just have this disgusting feeling inside. So im on day 5 now. I know for some people they would be able to quit with no wd at this point, but thats never been the case for me. After 3 days i always get 1 to 2 days wd. Its hell.
  
Anyway, since day 3 ive been trying to use less and less. Ive been sleeping like shit, comstantly throwing up, and am exhausted. Ive only been taking small match head size bumps at weird periods throughout the day. I just want to know if these symptoms are a sign that im effectively tapering down? Ill be getting a sub and some gaba on wednesday(fingers crossed), but im hoping maybe if i go close to cold turkey ill be done by then. Getting some weed tomorrow as well which will hopefully help the final stages.
  
So yeah, my question is am i effectively tapering, or are these all side effects of days of fentalogue use? Thanks.",1571074301.0

First mistake. These are the safes that require four AA batteries and you program your digital code , battery‚Äôs run low , replace and you‚Äôre good to go. I‚Äôve had this safe for around 4-5 years never had an issue one time with it. Well I get home from work and go to get into my safe and it isn‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm getting an error. It doesn‚Äôt even sound like the locking mechanism is attempting to work. I go up to the gas station buy some new batteries just to see if that had anything to do with it. It didn‚Äôt. So now I‚Äôm starting to get irritated, the one damn time I lock them in my safe this happens. I dont have any extra oxy, they are all inside. Normally I would just keep them at the top of my closet , no worries. Why I put them in there I cant recall. Anyway I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm gonna have to bust into this thing to get these pills. I‚Äôve got my .40 cal in there , passports , personal info but none of that shit matters , except the pills. So I take the safe out into the garage , I‚Äôm livid right now , I‚Äôve got a giant screw driver wedged in between the door and the frame trying to hammer it down and pry it open. I‚Äôve been working on this thing for almost an hour , sweating my ass off , garage door is wide open , neighbors probably wondering what the fuck is going on , and the door is starting to finally budge. Bunch of dust from the safe insulation is all over the garage and inside the safe. I‚Äôm picking it up and dropping it , finally I get the screw driver wedged between the locking bolt and I‚Äôm able to pry the door open. I‚Äôm in. Talk about the biggest relief ever. There‚Äôs dust and shit all inside the safe all over everything. First thing I do is grab the bottle and throw back 4 of them. Now I gotta clean up this mess. I dunno what reminded me of this experience but my wife was looking at me like a damn nut job.

dhispn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/dhispn/has_anybody_here_tried_drinking_tonic_water/,6,https://redd.it/dhispn,Poppy_Knight,Has anybody here tried drinking tonic water (Quinine) to boost the euphoria or analgesia caused by Suboxone?,"Hello Friends~

I have a lot of experience with a broad spectrum of opiates, with the exception of Suboxone. Roughly a decade ago a friend loaned me 2 or 3 generic tablets to try from his prescription. I vaguely remember the effects as: feeling a little bit sleepy, with a small amount of pain killing effects, and fleeting flashes of minor euphoria. It obviously eliminated ""cravings"" to go out in sketchy situations and cop dangerous, unpure drugs from unsavory characters- so that was a win. But if anything I wouldn't describe it as a great or overly particularly pleasurable experience. I've since preferred, and generally had access to, other opiates. So my general experience is very limited and *forget about knowing jack shit about Advanced Knowledge or any cool insider tips and tricks. Like Jon Snow I know nothing.*

That being said, due to circumstances outside of my control it appears that Suboxone may be the the only opiate agonist within my orbit for the near future. So I may as well learn how to wield it both safely and effectively. I've been reading up a little bit about the [pharmokinetics of Suboxone.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buprenorphine#Pharmacokinetics) It seems to me that the major metabolite of bupe/sub is ""norbuprenorphine"" which ""causes respiratory depression but not much antinociceptive effect because it has high affinity for glycoprotein so does not cross the blood/brain barrier much"". Based on my knowledge of [opiate receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_receptor#Major_subtypes) it sounds like NorBupe (shortened slang) is getting at the MU-2 opiate receptors in the spinal cord and causing the respiratory depression, but not getting at the MU-1 opiate receptors inside the brain to cause pleasure and pain relief. 

For folks new to the game, [p-glycoprotein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-glycoprotein) is a major part of the blood-brain barrier, and p-glycoprotein causes some drugs or diseases in particular to get hung up there and blocked from causing much interaction in the brain. So apparently the major Suboxone metabolite norbupe is one such active metabolite that gets trapped by those wily glycoproteins. There is one thing known to bypass this little problem, however. 

I remember reading at least a couple advanced opiate potentiation [guides](https://www.opioids.com/opiates/index.html), that said **drinking tonic water containing Quinine reduced the ability of glycoproteins to stop drugs from entering the brain and so therefore caused opiate potentiation.** Apparently its a fairly well known side effect of Quinine, and one reason it's not particularly safe to combine it with Loperamide. 

So my takeway is that drinking tonic water should* potentiate the good effects (euphoria and analgesia) of Suboxone. However, I'm not confident that is actually safe to do so. While I don't think this will contribute to the rare heart rhythm issues associated with Suboxone (more prominent in Loperamide abuse) I'd be potentially concerned this could possibly cause additional respiratory depression and make this potentiatory drug combination unsafe. Then again, I have zero clue because I have limited experience with Subs and zero experience experimenting with Subs and some tonic water. 

So now that I've explained where I'm coming from and shared some links to some scientific literature, I'd be grateful to ask the community if anybody has tried this before and what their experience might be. If someone *hasn't* tried this combination, but *has* used Quinine to potentiate opes or other drugs before, I'd be grateful to hear your experiences.

Coupled with a hernia, it now seems as if the pain is connected between the two areas, instead of only one area being an issue, and localized. For the past 3 years since it's gotten progressively worse, I have tried almost everything to ease the pain during the worse flair ups so to speak. I won't go into that in detail, but lots of effort has been put into holistic approaches, natural at home remedies, stretches, massages, OTC medication, as well as the standard Tylenol and Advil. Over the past 4 years, my ribs and hernia has put me in the hospital on 5 different occasions. The pain becomes so unbearable, I am literally in tears. Each time I go, I am given an immediate shot of a muscle relaxer, and 50% of the time I leave the ER with a small script of opiate pain medication. The medication varied each time, and was either Hydromorphone or Percocepts, and under 10/20 pills each time.   


For the past year it's become so unbearable, that more then 10 days out of the month I can't do anything. I can't leave the house, cook, clean, and am barely able to even use the bathroom on some occasions. It really does suck. I have a good friend who is on Oxycodone, and he has been giving me 10 and 20mg pills so help with the pain. The 10mg's are the quick release formula, and the 20mg's are the longer releasing formula. I dislike the 10mg quick releases, and prefer the 20's as they work longer and allow me function longer without having to take another pill. He has been giving them to me free of charge, but I am starting to feel guilty that sometimes he is low, because of me. We are both great friends, for life, but I hate it when I know he's secretly stressing without saying a word when hes low near the end of the month.   


I have been contemplating going to a doctor for over two years to discuss some method of help with the pain, but I am honestly very afraid discussing this issue with a Doctor, as the stigma currently attached with opiates is viewed extremely negatively. I don't want to be instantly labeled a drug user/seeker, and have my access so something I may need later on, to actually be able to live a quality life, completely voided. This has me very, very scared. I do not want to be in agony, and have my access to medication denied because of a mistake I have made while approaching my doctor. I want to wait the pain out, until it becomes so unbearable that their is absolutely no questioning my need for this medication. This also has me extremely scared. I am just so sad, scared, run down, and afraid of the future and what it holds. I have not worked, had any physical activity, sex, or have been able to sit in a vehicle for more than 2+ hours in over a year because of the pain.   


I am nearing my end here, of being able to live like this.   


How do I approach a Doctor, and how do I tell them about my pain. I feel as if no Doctor will care, or want to help, as they are under intense scrutiny themselves. I feel as if I have a one shot deal at this, and I cannot afford to lose or I will end up committing suicide as the pain is not decreasing, only getting worse.

if you had to come off opiates, which would you prefer to use and why?

Is there anything that you would tell someone before going on either drug that wasn't covered by either your doctor or pharmacist or healthcare professional?

I previously asked about people coming off methadone, and thanks to everyone for their reply, here in Ireland things are more geared towards maintenance, so if you were put on maintenance treatment, which would you prefer to use?

This rehab program is called the Aurora Opiote Recovery Program which I was referred to by my regular Doctor who is at an Aurora clinic. Over the past month or two at the most, I have gradually moved over from oxycodone to snorting heroin (No IV use).  I went from doing two-three 30 mg oxycodone pills everyday to doing about a quarter-half gram of heroin a day. 

At the time of my doctor appointment which was a month-two months ago, I was still doing oxycodone and didn‚Äôt move over to the heroin yet.. I would only do it when no pills were to be found which was maybe once or twice a month.  When I was being questioned by my doctor I told him I was only doing the oxycodone and didn‚Äôt say that I was doing heroin which was the truth. Besides the fact I maybe have done it at most 5 uses in the past 4 months. I didn‚Äôt tell him that I have ever done heroin though which he didn‚Äôt ask me anyways.  

About a day or so after my appointment, I got a call from the rehab program and they scheduled a time for an ‚Äúover the phone‚Äù interview is what it is was essentially.  They asked me questions about my use and see what type of treatment options would best suite me.  When they questioned me though I only told them about my oxycodone use not about the heroin. Which this was still at the time when I didn‚Äôt move over to the heroin yet so I wasn‚Äôt lieing to them. But they offer two types of treatment options the partial hospitalization program which is 7-14 days, everyday 9:00-3:45, provide medication for withdrawal symptoms, and have a physciotrist for you.  The other is an intensive outpatient program which is longer at about a month, 4 hours a days, 3 days a week, do not provide any medication.  They recommended and I am going to be doing the partial hospitalization program.  

 Now since I have been doing heroin, my tolerance has skyrocketed and my withdrawal symptoms are also a lot worse with intensity and quicker onset.  With this being the case I haven‚Äôt even been doing oxycodone at all since I don‚Äôt even really feel the pills anymore unless I do an extremely high dose which just isn‚Äôt worth doing considering I buy them off the street and they are extremely expensive which I‚Äôm sure all of you know.  

This place will treat you for any type of opiote and the two treatment programs are standard for everyone weather your a heroin user or a Vicodin user but who knows if the type of treatment you receive is different depending on the type of opiote your using? My question is - should I tell them that recently in the last month or so since my phone interview, I have been doing heroin and not the oxy anymore.  I don‚Äôt really want to tell them but do you think the way they provide treatment for me will greatly differ depending if I‚Äôm on the heroin vs the oxy?  And also, with them admitting me for oxycodone use and not the heroin do you think they would offer different types of medication for the withdrawl if I were on the heroin or oxy?

 The reasons I don‚Äôt really want to tell them is because firstly, with the interview they put me through - I told them all about my oxy use which is the substance they admitted me for but now since I‚Äôm doing the heroin and if I tell them I‚Äôm doing that now, who knows if I would get there, tell them, and they would have to change the whole type of treatment I‚Äôd be receiving now.  I don‚Äôt know.. I just feel like if I tell them it‚Äôs just going to be more of a hassle than just stay with the fact that I‚Äôm doing oxycodone and just leave it at that if the type of treatment would be the same with both substances? But I just don‚Äôt want them to provide me with the wrong type of treatment i actually should be receiving and just waste my time and effort with this. I also don‚Äôt want it getting back to my parents considering there devistated enough with me on the pills, if they find out I‚Äôm doing heroin there going to be heartbroken. :/ what should I do? I feel like I‚Äôm overthinking this a bit but I feel like it may be necessary for me to be upfront with the people at the rehab facility about this so I can receive proper treatment. 

One last thing - I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôll test my urine for substances and I‚Äôve heard heroin doesn‚Äôt show up on a standard five panel drug test is that correct? Not sure if that‚Äôs the type of test they‚Äôd perform but  I was going to pick up an oxycodone tomorrow so I‚Äôll atleast have that in my system If I decide not to tell them about the heroin use but is it true heroin use isn‚Äôt able to be determined by a drug test? I‚Äôm assuming it just shows that you have opiotes in your system but the exact type of opiote is unable to be determined?",1570956189.0

At first everything seemed too perfect. We spotted a couple junkie looking fellas chilling outside a gas station, went up and asked about where we could get some boy, and they pointed us in the direction of a house across the street. I'm fucking exhausted at this point, sick and agitated. We go up to the dude posted up outside and say we lookin for dope. As my BF is talking to the dude, who responded to that question with ""nah we only fuck with jesus christ"", I see a sock do some cartwheels over the fence. Immediately I knew they thought we were like narcs or something so we pushed one more time like ""nah bro we just trying to cop some black, we re good"" and he responded ""no, I want you to go. Right now. Piss off""....so we head back to the car and feel like shit about it. 

TLDR: tried to cold cop bc my plug wouldn't respond, found someone, and ended up sketching them out so hard they wouldn't sell to us lol


Moral of the story- if you got suburbanitis and are trying to cold cop, make extra efforts to communicate that you're legit and not tryin to fuck them over bahahaha. Seeing the sock fly over their fence just makes me giggle now, but at the moment I was damn pissed at myself.",1570952373.0

Meanwhile, I have a brand name Suboxone 8/2mg strip in front of me still in the foil/package. The name brand strip appears to contain 8mg buprenorphine hcl.

Does that really mean that, aside from possible differences in bioavailability, the generic subutex really does contain 0.64mg more bupe per dosage unit? That might sound extremely inconsequential, but it's actually 8% more bupe in the generic subutex tablets compared to brand name suboxone strips, at least for the 8mg versions. Assuming they have the same bioavailability (which is a stretch), it seems logical to choose the generic subutex tablets. The tablets also seem to contain less acetic acid than the strips.

I was at work, washing dishes as usual. After a while the monotony started to bug me. I started getting quite angry and sad. I *really* wanted to drink after work. And if you‚Äôd asked me if I wanted a shot of heroin right then and there I don‚Äôt know what I would have said. 

I started to think about my sadness, my wanting to use and the relationship between them. Do I want to use because I am sad, or am I sad because I want to use? Emotions cannot be trusted. I never know if I am genuinely sad about something, or if my subconscious is just trying to fuck me over. I tried to recede into observance and contemplation, without getting to caught up in the turbulence of how I felt. It did not really work. 

I thought maybe I have started to dislike my job, started worrying about if I will be doing this for the rest of my life and what happens if I can't get through my current uni degree. But it wasn't the job. It wasn't any of that. It was something else. 

I was scrubbing the pans with a palpable anger. I hated that fucking pan. I then started to think about my sister and good friend, who know that I have been going through a rough time and haven‚Äôt contacted me. Not once have they asked me if I‚Äôm okay. 

So I realised I was angry because of the resentment I was harbouring toward the two of them for not contacting me, when they both knew I have been in such a dark and precarious place with everything. As soon as this source of frustration and sadness was recognised as resentment toward them, I felt immediately better. Instantly. I let out a breath of relief and felt like I‚Äôd dodged a bullet.

1.) This is not my first time doing heroin. I used to smoke it off foil pretty frequently, but that was black tar and it's white powder where I am now so totally different density, purity, etc. Also obviously I'm going for a different ROA this time. Which brings me to my second disclaimer... 

2.) This is not my first time shooting up, either. I am a very experienced IV meth user. However, the drugs are so different that I feel beyond the technical aspects of actual injection I have no experience with what I'm trying to do here.

So yeah. I am currently in a city where meth (my DOC) is rather difficult to find, but I want to get good and fucked up. Second best thing, of course, is opis. I don't want to snort H though since I really do love the needle. I'm picking up 2 bags of dope, from what I understand each is approximately 50mg each. I've read that when you're snorting H for the first time you should go with a bump the size of a match head. I'm assuming that like meth it's supposed to be significantly less if it's IV. I don't want to accidentally overdose (I don't think anyone really does). I have Narcan but no one to use with and it would really compromise my living situation if someone found me. Point being, I know the risks but would like to minimize them. I don't have a mg scale. Is there any other way I can eyeball an appropriate dose?

Thanks in advance for taking the time to read my post. I recently picked up some BTH from my usual connect. It looks the same, smells the same, and seems to cook the same as it usually does.

However, upon injecting, I get a similar rush as normal, with one big change. There is a definite pins and needles feeling - anyone who has IV'd morphine knows the feeling. Along with the pins and needles, my finger tips get it especially strong but it quickly morphs into a fairly strong pain. Hard to describe, but it almost feels sharp and dull at the same time (I'm sorry, I know that makes no sense). Like the feeling of pins and needles, only it quickly turns into a painful version? It comes and goes quickly, pretty much right in line with the rush. I wouldn't be excited about getting high with this stuff if the pain was too much stronger.

Does anyone have any idea what is going on? I have fairly extensive IV experience but this is new to me. Thanks again and happy nods. :)",1570851917.0

Many of us here inject heroin, of course.  We Americans, as we all know, have tons of fentanyl in our national dope supply.  

As if fentanyl wasn't super-likely to cause accidental overdoses on its own, and therefore accidental deaths, it turns out the phenomenon of ***fentanyl-induced chest wall rigidity*** makes it even more difficult to successfully revive people who have overdosed partially or entirely as a result of fentanyl overdose.

( I had to go back on subs after I injured myself and found out I need surgery.   I was prescribed some morphine 15mg and I devoured them.   Then I grabbed some fentadope and felt like I was losing control.   )   
     So I started the subs again- after being off for 1 & 1/2 yrs ( was on them for 20, and they are a bitch to come off ).    I was keeping dose low as possible.   I usually dosed .75-1 mg in the AM , but on this particular day, I also iv‚Äôd another .5 mg around 330pm.   
      Around 6 I had the chance to grab some more fentadope bags, and said fuck it.   I wasn‚Äôt expecting full effects when I shot less than a bag around 630, but somehow I got really well.   Was catching a nod even.   I figured , well, when I do a shot tomm, it‚Äôll be even better.   
       However- it wasn‚Äôt.   In fact, I wasn‚Äôt able to get as high than the day I pre-dosed w .5 mg sub...   
        Does sub have some weird potentiating effect when taken in super low doses?   Like .02 mg?

So far I haven't seen any posts relating to this type of topic so I gotta ask. Has anyone ever engaged in fisticuffs whilst high on opiates? I'm not really a violent person, however when worse comes to worst, opiated allows me to eat pain. Anyone else got into a physical fight whilst under the influence of opiates?

Personally for me, the most recent engagement occured about 2 months ago. I admit I also had some liquer, weed and benzo's in system at this point in time, but at a minimal dose. During this time I was selling xanax to my long time customers in bulk, and at the end of the transactions I had about 20 2mg xans from Greenstone Pharma leftover. Since it was real late and I was happily high I decided to stay over my friends place as I was far away home, and on my way to his apartment I was handing out the rest of my xans to commuters and homeless people (I'm not really fond of benzo's.) 

Then, as I was a 15 minute walk away from my friends apartment, I came across a homeless crackhead and like everyone else I offered him a xanax bar. Now there was two bars left. One for him and the last for my pal. I gave him the xan and put the last back in my pocket. Dude noticed me put the last xan back in my pocket and was asking me if he could take the last one. I kindly said no but he kept pleading with me, saying how I could get stopped by the police and how it would be safer if he just took. Obviously I kept saying no which just angered him, and led to him trying to steal it off of me, reaching for my coat pocket. 

Afterwards I felt inclined to launch fist towards his cheeks... Which actually missed. Now that we both had our stances fixed, it was game on. Back and forth we swung our jabs and hooks at each other, most missed if not grazed one another. But, this crackhead managed to land a very nice punch at my jaw which made a crunch sound. However, I had the oxy coursing through my veins, I ate them throws like it was cornflakes on a Monday morning, I could see him looking perplexed at my endurance. We continued fighting but I could see Mr. Basehead losing stamina, eventually he put his all into a roundhouse, in turn I was able dodge to the left. Unfortunately for him this made him lose his footing. My knuckles connected with him cheekbone and he almost hit the ground. After a short groan he picked himself up and started hauling arse of the street. I wanted to go after him but with everyone staring I though it'd be best to start making a move.

I inherited this sub falling Into my lap back 2 summers ago when our old member u/zeeryeero created it but ended up stepping down shortly before overdosing and dying. He gave me the sub.  Spin helped a lot. Now I need help here. 

Obviously this is our NSFW 18+ dope porn sub for photos. I need moderate amount of help here removing sourcing, checking mod mail, approving posts caught in Filter, and helping with ideas maybe how to make the sub active more again. I need like 2 mods for this subreddit. 


- r/heroin: another sub I inherited as honorary head mod. Kicker went to prison and someone had to take over. I've got quite a few mods here now, but I'd like to add Even one or two more to control the sourcing. Remove locations. Remove rule violations. Check mod mail. I'll take on 1-2 and hold a backup list with 2 more for this one. 

- r/stims: I became head mod once again here too when spin left. We are gonna need some extensive help probably on this one. Please send a group DM to myself and u/knullare to discuss potential mod help interest. 

r/fuckingtweakers: was spins nsfw tweaker sub for 18+ pics. I'm head mod now. I need one or two people to help me with sourcing and modmail. 

Also not accepting mod apps on this one, but applications for r/opiatesgoneprivate are open as always. Please DM me for membership application if interested. Lastly quick reminder r/opiateswriters exists. I created that one last year. We could use some traffic

I had a couple g of some nearly uncut #4 that I bought with my money from an after school dishwashing job. I was in my senior year and once I got back from a long day of school I would wait until night came around 8pm. After I did my homework, had dinner with my family and played some video games, I would leave my parents in the living room and nonchalantly walk upstairs to my bedroom. 

There, after locking my door, I would plug my phone in and play some music that made me think of my crush Penelope, a damn cute girl who would flirt with me in study hall. I‚Äôd think about the school day, the girl I caught checking me out in the hallway, and how today Penelope sat close enough to me where our legs touched, both of us pretending we didn‚Äôt notice, her playing coy. I‚Äôd smile to myself as I opened my closet door and took out the baggie I had hidden in a small decoy box. From there I dumped a little out on my hand mirror and made 3 or 4 lines of the tan powder. I took my time, picking the right song and turning the music up. I looked in the mirror and fixed my hair. It was getting longer which I was happy about; I decided to start growing out my dark and wavy hair a few months earlier in an attempt to replicate a hairstyle I was fond of. I took a deep breath in. My room smelled of jasmine incense I had burned the day prior. I positioned the straw directly under my nostril and began to insufflate two lines before alternating nostrils. Then two more lines went up my nose succeeded by me tilting my head back as the powder coated my nasal cavity. I opened my phone and took note of the time. Five minutes later and my body began to be enveloped by a warmth. I laid on my bed, looking around at my band posters and flags as euphoria began to soak into my psyche. I laid on my stomach with my head hanging off the bed, looking at my phone in my outstretched arm. Penelope texted me. Like always I waited to reply, leaving her just outside of my reach and keeping her wanting more. It was a game I knew how to play. I slowly moved my head along to the music as if euphoria itself had me attached to its strings. 

Before I knew it I was getting tired. I wanted to tell Penelope I liked her. Another day. I have school tomorrow and it‚Äôs 10 pm. I have to be up at 6:00am. I closed the light in my room and quietly tiptoed towards the bathroom, passing my parents room where they were now sleeping, my dad snoring audibly. After brushing my teeth I returned to my now dark room and tucked myself in. I reached over to the speaker and lowered the volume of the music, turning it into faint percussive whispers. With the dope wearing off I focused on getting sleep. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get high next week I thought to myself- before I closed my eyes and awoke in the morning opiate haze.",1570774873.0

My pulse quickens, the icey meathooks from which my flesh hangs disappear for a moment. It takes everything within me to not rip into the bag in the middle of the store like a depraved animal.


‚ÄúNo. NO!"" I quiet the beast within.


When I finally get home I let the beast tear into the bag. Like a bear rummaging through a garbage bin, I find the goods. Hidden among the Ariprosol and Mirtazapine trash, the labels almost glow in beauty.


Oxycodone 10mg


Butalbital/Acetaminophen/Caffeine¬† 50/325/40


Amphetamine salts 15mg


Valium 10mg


For a brief moment I bask in the glory of the stash. Then my chemical deprived brain takes over and gets the party started.


Quickly I take out 5 of the Oxy, throw them in my mouth, and begin to chew. The Valium comes next, 3 of them, in the same manner.


While the pills are mashed into a spitty slime, I get out 2 of the amphetamines and begin to chop them into dust in a dollar bill trough.¬†


I grab the Butalbital and roll three blue beauties into my hand. I toss them one by one up towards the ceiling and catch them in my mouth.¬†


Grabbing a glass of water I swallow down the glorious cocktail. My body tingles in anticipation as I roll up another dollar to hoover up the amphetamines.


I lie on the floor, sniffing, snorting, waiting. I await my arrival into the opiate ocean, I dream of the warmth, apathy, and euphoria I know is coming.


Then it hits me, slowly at first, but gaining momentum quickly.¬†


First comes the electric buzz of the amphetamines, stimulating all my neurons. For a brief moment I swear time slows as my thoughts move faster than light. I am on edge as my body begins to feel the sudden urge to stand up.


As the edginess subsides I know my old friends oxycodone and valium have made their arrival to my brain. Their soft sweet embrace engulfs me, like a robe right out of the dryer.


A wave of sleepiness comes for me as I begin to float in the warm chemical agonism, but I fight it off. I know it's the last passenger to arrive off the bus of my bloodstream, good old butalbital.


As he makes his entrance I am finally in the full throws of blissful euphoria.


Everything around me melts away as gentle, soft, love and apathy surround me.

I ended up dating someone else, but when he got out of rehab, I gravitated back toward him and got back with him. he was clean for a long time, but when fall came he became kind of possessive and manipulative. it was a rough patch and he ruined my 18th birthday which is really hard to forget. but we got through it and eventually we were great. we spent every day together, but in April (of this year) he almost relapsed. I never know what to do or how to handle it. he started taking kratom, but I didn't know what it was, so I didn't bother him about it. he was spending more time with his friends, and I asked what they did together, and he said they smoked weed while he drove them around. I grew paranoid but tried to tell myself to stop worrying because I wanted him to have friends. but I knew that his ""friends"" were all addicts.

eventually he got sick and I took care of him and he said he was going through kratom withdrawals. it ended up being heroin withdrawals, which I found out because his mom found needles in his stuff. he admitted he lied. he relapsed because his friends offered him heroin and he ""didn't consider \[himself\] an addict"" and ""wanted to do it one last time."" he said he knew he fucked up but did it a few more times because he didnt want withdrawals. he said that he didn't tell me because he thought I would leave him. when I stayed with him, he promised to be honest because he realized how supportive I was.

but that was gaslighting, because he lied to me again. he told me he stopped kratom, and several times over the following few months I pointed to the green powder on his laptop or on his books. he said it was just there from months ago and that he wasn't taking it. of course there was a whole bag of powder in his bag. and he had been buying it when I was with him and I just hadn't noticed ‚Äî because I'm that stupid. I said I was mad that he lied, but I stayed with him. he started to get less affectionate and more distant. he was fired from his job because he was always late/leaving early, which I partially took blame for because we live in my college dorm in Westchester and he had to commute to Long Island every day. either way, it amplified everything, and he spoke to me less, spent more time on his phone, and appeared less caring. I didn't know what to do. usually I joked about it by saying something like, ""it would be nice if you loved me,"" and he would be like ""you know I love you so much."" but nothing changed with his attitude/behavior. he started going through kratom withdrawals because he couldn't afford more. I had to lend him $120 for car insurance. I woke up to him next to me whispering that he couldn't sleep and swinging his legs back and forth and holding onto his head. I said he was scaring me. I went out to get breakfast with my friends and when I came back he was gone. I called him and said I wanted to go with him wherever he was going and he said he was too far. he hung up and I checked his location and he was 5 min away. I texted him and he said he was going to therapy + an NA meeting. I checked his location again hours later and he was at his friend's house where he used to do drugs. I called and texted but got nothing. eventually he texted back saying he wants to go to rehab. he admitted that he tried to get heroin at his friend's house but he didn't have any so he got kratom instead.

he checked into rehab and I broke up with him before. we've been calling as often as possible and decided not to break up. I felt like I wasn't really in this decision. whenever we talk we act like we're still together, but whenever we're off the phone I feel alone, neglected, manipulated, upset. he knows he fucked up but I don't want it to be back to normal. my birthday is this week and he feels really bad about missing it but I can't stop feeling like he's ruined my birthday twice. I've only known him for two birthdays and he ruined both. I really hate waiting for his phone calls especially when he says he'll call but something happens where he can't. so far I've spent two nights crying alone in my room and getting gin drunk and it feels unfair.

The ones I get, I absolutely love. I started using them because I was no longer able to get the pharma 20mg oxycodone-hydrochloride I was getting from my mom. Oxy was my love. My absolute favorite high. Even when I started taking the pressed pills, I missed the wonderful high I got from a clean pharma pill. 

Over the weekend my mom decided to give me one 20mg pharma oxycodone (I am 100% positive it is real). I knew it wouldn‚Äôt do as much to me as prior to when I started taking the pressed pills, so I decided I was going to smoke it and go for the rush. Now keep in mind, I don‚Äôt take the whole 30mg pressed pill at once. I smoke an eighth at a time and build up to a quarter if I feel the first eighth didn‚Äôt do the trick after 20-30 minutes. So I figured smoking the entire 20mg oxy would at least give me a rush if nothing else. 

Boy was I wrong. First, did these pills always taste so awful?! I was never a pill smoker back when I was taking them regularly, so maybe my memory is bad from the few times I did smoke one, but holy hell. Compared to the wonderful burnt marshmallow flavor of my pressed pills, this tasted like chemical waste. I got so sick to my stomach from the taste I couldn‚Äôt even finish the pill and gave it to my mom to smoke. On top of that, it gave me an instant headache. Not to mention I felt literally nothing from it, which I can't complain about. I decided to then sniff half of another one of the pharma pills and even the taste from the drip really put me off to it.

I think I might have fallen out of love with oxy. Anyone relate?

**tl;dr:  usually nice bf turns into asshole during withdrawals, how do I talk to him while being sympathetic/non-judgmental/supportive without just letting him walk all over me and enabling his hurtful behaviour.**

Long story short of it, I was wondering how I can talk to my bf when he's in WDs. We're in a long distance relationship and he's been using off and on for a while now. Now, I'm not exactly an angel myself when it comes to drug use, but I've stayed away from opiates because I have a good feeling that would be the one that really clicks for me and gets me into trouble if I start using on the regular.

I'm sympathetic to how shitty someone can feel during WDs, but I've never experienced opiate WDs, only benzos/uppers/nicotine.

My issue is, whenever my bf is going through WDs, he turns into-- putting this delicately-- a real asshole. Neither one of us is in the position to travel and see each other right now (work, finances, etc) so we mainly communicate over text. Once again, I know that being in WDs is horrific, but he often ends up being rather mean while messaging, picking apart my words, being overly critical, just generally saying hurtful things. If he's using or far enough removed from WDs, we never fight, but there's a specific edge to him when he's withdrawing. I try to brush it off and not engage, to be sympathetic and respond by saying that I love him and I know things are shitty right now, etc... really walking on eggshells to not say the wrong thing or get into a fight when he's feeling like crap. That is, however, wearing me down.

I haven't brought it up and I don't know how to or if I should. I guess I want to know, from the perspective of opiate users, what I can say to him when he's in WDs and generally being abrasive, and how I should broach the issue of his behaviour during WDs, if at all. I'm not going to be the person who tries to force him into rehab or anything like that, that doesn't really go well if it's externally motivated in my experience, and I'm not in a position to judge since I know what it's like to self medicate when you're in a lot of mental anguish. I just want to be supportive I suppose and not make things worse for him, but also protect myself and my feelings at the same time.

If you don't share my point of view, you can freely comment and I would appreciate to read your opinions about the matter.

So, heroin: the queen of all drugs, the hardcore drug par excellence, the most dangerous drug in the world... Many things have been said about this drug for the last 50 years or so. Many things are true but others are a complete farce.

**\*Disclaimer\*: I'm not trying to promote heroin use. In fact, I do not recommend anyone to do this drug. It is extremely addictive, its addiction carries horrible wds and you can ruin your life and the one from your surroundings very easily. Im just telling the reality behind this ""Obscure"" drug and is up to you if you are gonna take the risks or not.** 

**DO NOT MIX HEROIN WITH OTHER DEPRESSANTS SUCH AS BENZOS, ALCOHOL OR OTHER OPIATE. IT IS ALSO DANGEROUS AND NOT SAFE TO MIX IT WITH STIMS SUCH AS COKE OR METH.** 

Once said that, let's debunk some myths:

1. ""Heroin can only be injected, so I stick to other drugs""

False. Heroin like meth, cocaine or any other drug can be taken via insufflation, inhalation or injected, even orally. The difference between one method of administration to another is the bioavailability. This is basically the amount of the actual drug that actually makes effect in your organism. For example, the BA(bioavailability) for heroin snorted is about 70% whereas when injected is about 99%. This means when injected, H is more effective and therefore you need less amount of the drug to produce the same effect.

But actually most h users snort heroin in the US and in Europe they commonly smoke it. This is because in Europe most of the H is of type #3, meaning is heroin base which isn't water soluble so the bioavailability via insufflation (snorted) is low. In the US, however, most of the heroin AFAIK is #4, meaning is in the salt form and so is very soluble in water and people prefer to snort it.

So you know the scene in Pulp Fiction when Uma Thurman sniffs heroin and she immediately overdoses? That is because he took too much because he thought it was cocaine and cocaine is less active than heroin by mg.

2. ""I don't want to try H because I don't want to die, that's why I take oxys""

It has something of truth but mostly is false. Heroin in itself (pure form) isn't so different than oxys or hydros. It's more potent, more euphoric but it's not a class of its own, is an opiate and once taken it converts into morphine. That's why it shares many characteristics with morphine. The only difference with morphine is the speed it passes the ""brain barrier"". Heroin is even legally administered in countries like the UK (in very strange circumstances) when other painkillers aren't working.

The problem is purity. In real life you are not gonna find 100% heroin as it comes from the pharma. So, the H could have anything that's why is important from where you are getting it. Now, many heroin doses are laced with fentanyl, a more potent opiod that is active at minimal doses, so overdoses are more and more frequent. But not all allegedly H OD's are due to H (it can be because of the presence of other drugs like fent or poisons.) So if you know that you are getting real heroin with no poisons or other more dangerous drugs is just to take small doses first and then scale from there.

3. ""If I take heroin only once, I become addicted""

False. This depends on the personality, the chemistry of each individual but normally you don't get addicted in the first, second, third or fourth time of using it (this is from my own experience.) I have also found the effects of heroin to be exaggerated in some reports: ""I snort a line and I was in heaven, 1000 times better than sex."" At least, if you snort it that's not the case. You will feel very happy, calm, serene, giddy but actually it feels very natural (for me more natural even than weed.) That's what make people hooked on the drug. You can take it any day after work or whatever and it doesn't intoxicate you as alcohol or strong sedatives do. Also, there's no harsh comedown like with stims. But it's all an illusion: Heroin is very very addictive and don't underestimate its effects, never.

4. ""If I don't take H in a regular basis, instead just 2 or 3 times a week Im not gonna get addicted""

This is the opposite belief as the other one. There are people that believe that taking heroin or any other addictive drug ""recreationally"" means they can take it as far is not 6 or 7 times a week. There's something you know called ""tolerance"". Our bodies build a tolerance to any poison (drug) taken as a natural response. That's why you'll never feel the same experience like the first one you do with taking an opiate or other drug, because of tolerance. So, if you take heroin twice or three times a week you are gonna need more and more to get the same effect. And believe me: you are gonna get hooked. So, do not count and plan to do it, for instance, every saturday or at a specific day and hour. Just do it in VERY SPECIAL OCASSIONS. Heroin addiction is no joke.

5. ""The acting of a fictional H abuser in movies""

Have you seen The Sopranos? Do you remember the times Chris (Tony's nephew) takes H and is like talking as if he's drunk a full bottle of vodka? This is not exactly what happens when you take heroin. Unlike alcohol and sedatives, opiates as many of you know (H no exception) in MODERATE DOSES doesn't make you look retarded and to move like a drunkard. It is more discrete, you are more lucid and somewhat happy and content about everything. It's not like everything around you starts to spin very fast and you can't hardly move. No, that's not what happens with heroin. I prefer the acting of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction when he's smiling and walks and talks just a bit more sloooowly...

When you are comfy, in bed for example you may experience what is called a ""nod"" you go from a state of lucidity to a dream-like state, it's hard to describe. If someone calls you or you are forced to speak (IN MODERATE DOSES!) you can in fact speak like sober, you just have to take the right amount. Obviously, a strong dose gets you fucked up but not in normal doses. Also, there's no ""dishinibition"" from my experience. You know alcohol and benzos makes you do, sometimes, foolish things that you wouldn't do sober. Heroin is not like that (no blackouts, no amnesia...). It's an opiate and therefore acts similarly to oxys or the hydros that are in your grandma's cabinet.

I had a huge fentanyl addiction which I quit three years ago. Stayed dead sober for about a year, but eventually gravitated back towards drugs, hoping I could chip.

Honestly, I was able to chip with heroin successfully for about a year. Now though, I end up pushing it too far every time I use, then get some minor withdrawals. I always manage to force myself to stop for a while when this happens, mostly out of fear of falling back into active addiction.

So my question. Do you think it's possible to chip with weaker opiates like codeine or tramadol? Basically something that isn't good enough to trigger those junkie instincts. Or would this just end up with you going back to your drug of choice?

These last few days I've had some peculiar intestinal discomforts. It's not pain, more like pressure and friction, mostly in the left lower side.

Plenty of resources, need advice.","Hello good people! So I kind of got myself into a bit of a bind. I have used oxycodone and other opiates as well as benzos and other drugs on and off for around 5 years for a greater degree of frequency as time has gone on. I have gone through opiate withdrawal, benzo withdrawal, and minor stim withdrawal plenty of times, sometimes worse than others. 

So here‚Äôs where I got. I had built up a pretty solid natural tolerance to oxycodone. I could safely take 90-120 mg of oxy in a given day no problem. I would only go for a few days and then stop for a week or two. Withdrawal wouldn‚Äôt be debilitating or anything just discomfort and minor flu like symptoms. The usual suspects. 

Well about 3 months ago my dude had me come over because he got another oxy connect and he wanted my opinion on how legitimate the pills were. They were pressed I could tell and for the first time I tried a little bit of a press. Just did a little bump maybe an 1/8th of the pill and I thought it was awesome. Anyways i will cut to the chase I started taking the presses regularly and have every day for about a month now. 2 weeks ago I tried to stop with some subutex and it didn‚Äôt seem to even effect me. I missed work I was so fucking sick from fent withdrawal. Now I‚Äôm having to take these god damn presses every day to maintain

TL;DR- Developed a pretty strong fent pressed blue habit to the point where blowing a 30mg oxy has no effect on me and I get horrible incapacitating withdrawals if I stop. 

Now I can‚Äôt afford to miss work. I can line a couple days off up if I need to but I need advice on how to get off these quickly and without jeopardizing my career with the less discomfort being the better option. Here‚Äôs what I have at my disposal:

-Fent presses (very consistent strength, seems equivalent to 100mg of oxy per pill)
-Real 30mg oxycodone (blues)
-8mg subutex
-8mg suboxone 
-5mg and 10mg valium
-Kratom
-Clonodine
-In a couple weeks I will have 90 2mg xanax bars which are my prescription. Usually don‚Äôt take them haven‚Äôt taken benzos in about 2 weeks
-Adderall 20mg and 30mg (I don‚Äôt see how these could be useful but I‚Äôm open to suggestions)

Any advice would be appreciated. The sooner the better of course before anything else changes or gets worse. Feel free to DM me. Thank you stay safe!",1570598675.0

Out of sight out of mind type of thing. I was the guy that couldn't wait to come on here and post my latest score. Anyway, it's pretty crazy even to me, but I hit 2 years clean a few days ago. I say its crazy because just a few short years ago I thought me getting clean would never happen, that my life was hopeless, and living life without doing opiates in general was impossible. Over those years I was dope-sick more times than I wasn't. I kid you not, my tolerance was so high I could shoot a brick of ECP, in 24 hours. I was bad, real bad. I look back now and still have trouble grasping the things I did for heroin. It will boggle my mind for the rest of my life.

Be forewarned this is a long post. I wasn't going to even post it at first, but I've found that sharing my story is therapeutic. I know this isn't the type of post most people in active addiction want to read, but I'm hoping it might sway someone to give the sober life a shot. (No pun intended). Trust me, I was one of those people who rolled my eyes at posts like these when I was using, I get it. I'm just sharing my road to 2 years clean.

Backstory:

After using dope for 4 years I went to rehab in Florida, but knew in my heart I didn't want to get clean yet. I lasted about three weeks when I got back home and went back to using. I ended up buying fake piss online, to get past my parent's random drug tests, and skipped out on IOP (making sure that I made it so they couldn't give out any of my information to my parents). I had to abide by their rules since I had no money for my own place at the time. I knew I was heading down a real bad path again, so when the opportunity came to live in a sober house, I took it. I ended up becoming pretty depressed spurred on by heavy cravings, to which I got rid of by using Kratom ( the sober house looked at Kratom like it was a serious drug). I knew it wasn't detectable on the drug tests they gave, but they hit me with a curve-ball by sending my piss to a lab.  Believe it or not I was sent to rehab for 2 weeks for coming up positive for Kratom. I get why they sent me, but to be honest Kratom helped me more than Suboxone ever did (craving wise at least). Anyway, I ended up getting about 6 months clean from the sober house and moved to an Oxford house. After 2 weeks, I get a text on my google phone number from my old dealer saying ""I got real good shit, it's been awhile, I'll hook you up"". I had changed my real number, but forgot about the google numbers I use to use. I was able to ignore the texts for about half the day, but the truth is the thought was embedded in my mind and I couldn't get rid of it. I stupidly thought, ""I've been clean for awhile, surly a few bags over the course of a week won't hurt, I can get high here and there"". Wrong. I met up with my dealer who to be fair was always good about telling me if the bags were good, bad, fent, or real dope. He told me it was fent, and to be really careful. I remember the feeling of having bags in my hand after being clean for so long. I got this naughty type of feeling, and started to sweat a bit, and then this rush of excitement flowed through me. I remember saying out loud ""this is such a bad idea"", which was an understatement.

This is when the first miracle happens. I stop by my local Walgreens to buy works. I've bought works from them a million times, and never once did they not have them. The lady tells me they didn't get their paperwork approved yet to sell them. She says that their current paperwork expired this morning and they should be back to being able to sell them the next morning. She stated this is rare and usually happens once or twice a year max. So out of all the days it could happen, it happened on the day I decided to relapse. I go home, snort a very little bit, and get pretty rocked. Hours later I drive back to the Oxford house, and wait until about 1 am. I know my room mate comes home from work anywhere from 2 - 2:30 am, so I'm good with time. I start texting a female, and at the same time I accidentally rip a bag open and all the dope spills out on the bathroom counter. Being a typical addict, I say to myself, ""I did half a bag earlier and was good, so a whole bag should be ok"", not wanting to waste any precious dope. Mind you the bags were pretty small, about a pinky nail's worth in each. I snort it and resume my text conversation, and that is where everything goes black. The next thing I remember is hearing ""wake up"", ""wake up"", but everything is still black. This went on for what seemed like an eternity. I was able to hear peoples voices and was aware of them, but I couldn't open my eyes. Finally my eyes jolt open and I gasp. I awake to paramedics standing over me slapping my face, my shirt cut off, and my tongue sore as hell and bleeding. All of a sudden I get this gnarly pain in my head, and my hearing starts going in and out. I get helped to an ambulance and the medics are asking me loads of questions, but my hearing is still going in and out so I keep asking them to repeat themselves, and yelling not realizing it. I'm also slurring my words. I clearly remember the look on my house mate's faces, they were so frantic. I felt so ashamed. My father got there so fast, he drove from an hour away in what seemed like about 25 minutes. I just kept saying how sorry I was, and he kept telling me how glad he was that I was ok.

I come to find out that I was found by my roommate, who by the grace of god was let off of work early for the first time in about 6 months. When they found me my heart rate was 6 bpm, right at death's doorstep. On top of that I was hit with narcan 4 times, to which if I didn't come back from, they weren't going to try a 5th time. Apparently if 4 shots of narcan doesn't work, there isn't any hope of bringing you back. The doctor told me that I lived because I was found shortly after, and I snorted instead of shot (Walgreens couldn't sell me works). He said if another 5 minutes passed, and / or if I shot up, I'd be dead, no if's and or but about it. For whatever reason, all my ducks were in a row that night, and a series of super lucky events saved my life. The shitty part is I never got to thank my roommate. He was rarely at the house when I was, so we only had a few conversations. I didn't have his number or anything, and I was too ashamed to ever step foot near that house again.

That ordeal scared me enough to get on subs, taper down, and become completely clean from opiates for 2 years now. Honestly, in a twisted way, almost dying was the best thing that could of happened to me at that point. Almost dying essentially has saved my life thus far. Do I still have cravings? Of course. But I got into therapy and learned how to deal with them, and not run for the needle. Making healthier lifestyle choices quelled my depression ten fold. I enrolled in community college, l and just recently graduated with honors with an associates degree in computer engineering.  Honestly, I think the reason I did so good was fueled from the fact that I had no other choice at that point. It was like continue doing dope and die, or try your best and live, with no in between. So I chose the live path. On top of that I never went to a 4 year school and had the real college experience like all my friends, which I've always wanted to since a kid. I just wanted to live a real life. The ironic thing is I was always book smart, but just made bad life choices. Once you make that leap, and have good things built up in your life, it will help greatly in making you not want to go back to the hell of active addiction. All the good things you had in your life previous to your addiction will come back and then some, trust me. When I was using, I was working a shitty dead end job, no school, no girlfriend, just me and heroin, with nothing to look forward to, but now I have things to lose, and have a sense of purpose which is a huge factor in my sobriety. I am an addict for life, and I know this, but I won't let that define me, it is what it is. Having a good support system is also something that helped me immensely. For all the shit I put my friends and family through, they always stuck by me and never gave up, and for that I am forever grateful. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying any of this in a ""look at me now"" or a bragging type of manner, but to simply show that no matter how big your habit is, or how hopeless and lost you may feel, you can always turn your life around, because it was all bad for me, and although I still have a long way to go, I can honestly say that  I'm happier then I've been in as long as I can remember.  I'm also proud of everything I've accomplished in these short few years which gives me a sense of self worth, something I lacked when I was using. It's still an everyday struggle, but the aforementioned things helped me and many people I know stay sober, and I hope some if it can help you. The only aspect I can't seem to shake are the drug dreams. Man are they vivid.

For everyone who got this far, thanks for reading my long ass story. Is my story any different from most people in active addiction? Not at all. I just feel like I got a second chance, something that dozens of my friends didn't get. Even when I was shooting 6 bag shots, I somehow never overdosed, and thought I was one of those people it would never happen to, but it did, and ironically only off of one bag. If this helps just one person struggling, it's mission accomplished to me. For everyone who is sober, keep fighting the good fight, and to everyone still using just remember, as long as there is air in your lungs, there is always hope! There is no shame in needing to use a form of MAT (medical marijuana for me), there is no shame in talking to a therapist, and there is no shame in coming clean to someone about your addiction! To be honest, keeping quiet for so long about my addiction is something I still regret to this day. Anyway, I am always here to talk for anyone who needs someone to vent to. I can relate to just about every aspect of addiction, because trust me when I tell you I've been through it all.

This was way longer then I planned on, lol. Thanks again for taking the time to read.

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow thanks for the gold!

Btw, don't ever let anyone stigmatize you for being on a MAT. Subs, methadone, Kratom, MM etc. It statistically is the best course of action by far for helping us keep needles out of our arms, yet certain people and meetings seem to look down upon them.

Did pills for 7 years before, ran with a lot of different people over the years. Not many of them remained friends as the game normally dictates. One such individual, Bret, I haven't spoken to in 3 or 4 years now. As far as I knew he was clean. 3 weeks ago I found out he died from an overdose from fent. 

I didn't really care, but found out there was a service coming up. Got in touch with Bret's newly wed wife and wanted to get the blessing to come. Bret had thrown me under the bus the first time he got caught selling drugs, and the second, and the third. According to him it was my fault that he did drugs. I gave him his first oxy, I own that. His other best friend was there with us but we don't discuss that. We don't discuss how Bret was an alcoholic at 17 when I met him, without my influence. Needless to say his parents hate my guts. I talk to Bret's wife and am told that if I attempt to speak to his family his mom will ""choke me out."" I'm good. I don't need that headache in my life.

So I battled trying to be a good man and do the right thing for a few days before I came to the conclusion I wasn't going. Things got better, I was in a rut for a few days but that passed. During that time I reached out to one of my ladies, checking in on the other who was diagnosed with lung and bone cancer about a month and a half ago. This woman treats me like family, and also lets me move her blues for her so there's a personal and professional relationship with her.

I'm texted back by my ladies girlfriend that she's doing okay, she's not doing well but she's going to fight this. I got busy at work and at home and of course taking care of myself making sure I got some boy so I didn't respond. The next day I text back the girlfriend that I was glad to hear my lady was keeping in good spirits and that I would see both of them soon.

Mobil gas stations accept google pay so I was thinking of going to a station and offering people paying with cash a discounted rate if they pay me the cash and I pump their gas using google pay credit.

Usually I'm pretty good with stuff like this but I don't feel 100pct on my answers and wanted opinions here.

1. He just tapered from 90 - 120mg oxycodone ir a day to 0 in approx 10 days after being on oxycodone for years with no break. He is currently 48 - 56 hours (rough estimate but somewhere in that range) in with 0 medication and is having little to no withdrawal aside from slight restlessness, malaise, very very minor sweating and sneezing more than usual, most of which have all abated in the last 12 hours. Is he in the clear, will symptoms get way worse in the next 24 hours through the 72 to 96 hour range? I'm tempted to say if this is the worst it gets at the 48 to 56 hour range and if your symptoms are gone right now you'll be fine, but wanted 2nd opinions.

2. He took a drug test today and was 100pct clean of everything. He wants to show himself that he really is done with this stuff and has it in his head that the real test for him is not a clean UA, it's not no withdrawal symptoms... it's can he spray naloxone 4mg/ml in his nostrils without any precipitated withdrawal. Now I'm very much of the belief that once you have no more metabolites or active drug in your system as is confirmed by a clean UA (I understand the cutoff threshold points can be higher than what you may have in your body but for arguments sake assume metabolites are under 50ng/ml), AND once you have no more withdrawal symptoms, you have no activity at any receptor sites of any significance and as this is naloxone and NOT naltrexone, the antagonist activity of naloxone should have no effect on you because you have no opioid activity for it to replace and since the receptor sites should be empty based on clean UA and total abatement of withdrawal symptoms the action of naloxone binding should have no effect insofar as causing withdrawal to reappear. However, and here's the question. Since opioid tolerance is a factor here and abatement of withdrawal syndrome plus clean UA do not have anything to do with changes in opioid tolerance, is it still possible that naloxone could cause re-emergence of symptoms, particularly precipitated withdrawal? The pharmacology suggests no to me but there is very little information on use of naloxone after the end of withdrawal syndrome. Most information details naltrexone use after as an inverse agonist but nothing of naloxone. So to make it simple, should this guy spray naloxone up his nose will it precipitate a secondary withdrawal syndrome after he has no more withdrawal symptoms and has a clean UA?

Thank you guys so much for your time and any opinions you can offer no matter the range or spectrum of your answers.",1570523432.0

She will routinely take forever as a consequence to be able to finally register and inject everything all in one go, so she will constantly pull back to ensure she's still in and not missing.  As you very well may have assumed by now from what I am talking about and the title of the post I was wondering (as I told her I would make a post on here to ask any of you that may be more knowledgeable than me as a junkie) if there is a way once the blood and drug mixture inevitably clots up.  Which makes injection in that rig impossible. Which then requires swapping out gear and then being able to see just how much had clotted once it is in the cooker. (or even worse if the clot winds up preventing retrieving any of it if it is clotted in the needle tip and the back end of the rig) Quite occasionally a good portion of it all ends up being lost in the clotted blood itself which then brings me to my question.  


Is it possible to add something into the cooker that would be able to break apart or dissolve the blood clot? Would very much appreciate it if someone could enlighten me/us on this subject and thus help us/her the ability to be able to recover said drugs which found themselves trapped in said clot.


I could swear I recall someone posting a solution to this problem before, can't for the life of me find anything of help for this issue though.  I don't recall either if it was a post dedicated to this problem or someone who replied to a post in some other thread a solution to this problem someone may have brought up in a post on some other topic or something else.  I could swear too I read that within the last year or two, but never bothered committing it to memory due to me never really experiencing this issue myself often enough to want to find a solution.


At least I hope I am remembering all that correctly that I did read a post from someone giving a solution to this very same issue and that I hadn't just dreamt the whole damn thing up or somehow misremembered it to such a large degree that I am way off base on what someone had provided a solution to some completely different issue and I am absolutely delusional.",1570525573.0

I am a recreational pill user (oxycodone is my choice) and have not used in 2 months.  When I do use, my tolerance is usually the same...a 30mg oxy is my dose and I if I have the supply I will take 3x a day.  So 90mg a day is ideal when I am in party mode and I usually will use for 3-5 days and then take a few months break.  (mostly because I don't have a dealer so just get when I travel to places that sell it over the counter)

Anyway, now the fun stuff....I am traveling solo to Thailand next week for 3 weeks and looking to have fun.  Thailand does not have oxy available but DOES have tramadol (50mg) and codeine (30mg) with paracetamol (500mg) over the counter.  I don't care what the internet says, I have bought this the last 2 times I was there and it was super easy. haha

SOOO...this is where I need your help and opinions, please go easy on me. lol

Should I take a 1 hour flight to Cambodia while there and get oxy and try to smuggle a bunch back to Thailand (thinking like 20pills - 30mgs) in my pocket or in a random pill bottle.  I have done this in Mexico and it worked flawless, but obviously this is a risk.

OR.... do I just stick to Tramadol and Codeine which is not the high I most enjoy...but saves me from the flying to Cambodia and spending a day in a airport nervous about security.

If you comment saying stick with tramadol and codeine, any recommended cocktail doses for both to have the best effect?  Last time I took a 200mg tramadol and 90mg codeine and the tramadol made me feel very sick the next day.  3 days later I took 100mg and felt fine, but the high just wasn't even close to an oxy :(

I ended up sitting in that jail for 11 days before things were straightened out and I could bail out to go back and answer for my charges. Nonetheless, this is my experience with cold turkey methadone detox from 120 mg daily. For almost 2 years I had been using only methadone, and the occasional tokes to settle upstart anxiety and restlessness. 

Day 1 - picked up around noon by Marshall‚Äôs and was puking and sweating by nightfall. Was given 1 ondansetron for nausea my nurse.

Day 2 - okay day. Started to get more and more anxious as I was locked away with no papers and no charges (fed marshalls fuck up)

Day 3 - can‚Äôt stomach any of the food. Back to puking. Starting to get severely dehydrated. Always freezing cold as this county was kept at 60 and we weren‚Äôt allowed to cover up with the piss poor shitty blanket they gave us. Using water bottles filled with hot shower water and putting them in armpits and between legs to keep from shivering. Also, I can feel every vertebrae in my low back (where I had 2 surgeries) and my legs have deep, gnarly, bone pains. 

Day 4/5 - on liquid diet, shitting 10x a day, butthole bleeding and sore from 1 ply tp and diarrhea. Cant move from bed except to shit and eat jello. Anxiety reaches the point where I‚Äôm biting my arm to the point of bleeding to keep from attacking the closest person or inanimate object. Full crazy man mode. In tons of pain. 

Day 6 - back to the 1000 calories a day meal trays. Gag as I try to stomach grits and shit again. Shitting all the time.  Extremely dehydrated and weak still. Very emotionally volatile. Still biting my arms as an anti-anxiety/insanity measure. The pain let me focus on something else besides ailing body. Just starting to sleep a few hours at night. Lights on 24/7. Still no paperwork or charges and that is a huge issue.

Day 7 - Thank god for commissary. Got some thermals, socks, toiletries (hadn‚Äôt brushed teeth in 7 days or had soap to shower with), and fuckloads of ramen and snacks. Starting to get my appetite back. Still desperately dehydrated. Sluggish . Can‚Äôt walk more than 10 steps without literally panting. Still sore as fuck.

Day 8 - finally get my charges and paperwork straightened out. Get bail hearing set. This takes a lot of anxiety out, but at night when I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôm still biting my arms and pinching my triceps. 

Day 9 - Get transported to court and get to see the sunlight and green for the first time since going in. It was as close to a drug high as I‚Äôve ever felt. At this point I‚Äôm eating and drinking as normally as one can in county. I smell like withdrawal and switch between sweating and freezing. My body literally just reeks. 

Day 10 - same shit, different day, but hopefully I‚Äôll get out soon. Sleep still elusive.

Day 11 - freedom! Exit county very weak, still dehydrated, and very anxious. Go home for the night to a monstrous meal and a couple cans of sprite. From
Here on out, when out of county, I would eat like a fucking animal. 

Day 12/13 - driving with a friend for 18 hrs back to home state. Very weak, in a lot of pain sitting in a seat for that long. Sleep cycle still fucked. 3-4 hrs a night at best.

Day 14 - Feeling the best yet. Turn myself in for my charges. Make it into jail and have a seizure while talking with the nurse. (Never had one before). Get put in the infirmary for a day before I bail back out. 

Day 15 - Weak, light-headed, and woozy. Begin two day drive home with homie. Tgod I had someone to watch out for me. Drinking 2 gatorades a day plus shitloads of water to try to rehydrate. Eating every meal like it‚Äôs my last. Slowly, but surely gaining strength back. Back pains and leg pains slowly subsiding.

Day 16 - back home. Peace and quiet. Comfy bed. Lots of hot baths. Still trying
gain strength back. Sleep still fucked

Day 20 - slept from 9 pm to 9 am. What a fucking miracle. Still weak and tired during the day. Nowhere near my usually energy levels, but I‚Äôm getting there. Gaining strength every day.

To be frank I was worried as fucked getting off of methadone. Methadone have me my life back and gave me the chance to kick dope and not have to waste a single second of my day thinking about cravings. And with charges and prison sentence looming, it seemed like I was primed to fall right back to the needle. Butttt as of right now I‚Äôm running with the progress and hoping that when I go to prison it will cement my sobriety. 

Important to note - I lack an essential gene for breaking down certain medicines. Most opioids I don‚Äôt absorb efficiently. In fact it‚Äôs like 1/3-1/2 of the dose that I absorb. This was a test run years ago by my psych and I wish I had more information, but in hindsight of what was a much easier than normal methadone withdrawal, I assume I had 2 benefits 1). I had only been using methadone for <2 yrs and 2). I don‚Äôt think I was absorbing the full dose, so it was more comparable to cold turkeying a lower dose. 

This was my experience detoxing methadone. It was FAR easier than I thought/was told it was going to be. I thought it would take years for me to work my way off, but now it has happened in the blink of an eye and I‚Äôm nothing but thankful.

A few months later, I tried real pharma oxycodone pills (40mgs), no anti-abuse formula and the effects were frankly very similar. In fact, they feel from my own experience so similar that I don't think I would distinguish one from the other. 

H was taken via insufflation and oxycodone was taken orally. Well, heroin acts faster but after 30 minutes, the effects are just the same. I have nodded from doing both drugs. So you people take H just because is cheaper? If oxy was at the same price as street heroin, knowing that the H has no fentanyl or other shit like that, what would you choose?",1570471965.0

Methadone isn‚Äôt a joke but it‚Äôs made that way by signing up for treatment effectively making you a slave (what other disease does the population get secluded, not given the ability to treat it at home unless they EARN it? And cannot be allowed to receive their treatment like a normal human being in disease at a pharmacy....ridiculous) Suboxone works for, especially nowadays with fent everywhere, very very little for those with small tolerances and also is a partial agonist leaving quite a large portion being treated with it to end up still wanting or craving that missing piece and then falling off of the treatment.

Hello all, 

So I am very new to opiates and before I start going balls to the wall with these drugs I figured I better do some research. I figured who would know it better then users  themselves. So to cut to the chase I got prescribed some oxy. 12 count of 5 mg each. yesterday I popped two even though I only supposed to take one every 6 hours. I figured this would give me a high feeling. I didn't really feel high at all but I did take an amazing nap lol.

1.)  How much do I have to take to be noticeable high

2.) What to expect while high 

3.) What should I look out for while doing this

I've always railed them, simply too impatient to wait out the onset of popping em orally. but now I regret it majorly because the damage it caused my nose, and I only did it for a few months. I won't get into too much detail about it but it can be very painful just to blow my nose with a tissue now. And its always really really dry, which makes it more painful. My theory is it might be because when you snort pills you snort all the fillers also which clogs up your nose, unlike snorting more pure drugs like cocaine which your nose can absorb most of.  But anyways, I thought i might give some of my advice, and ask some of your advice.. Definitely use a OTC nasal spray if you're going to snort these, before and after. just to keep it moisturized and hopefully it'll help heal it/maintain its health. My other advice is just don't snort em to begin with, either have the patience for the comeup and just pop em... or smoke them, which is just as much of a hassle as snorting them, (it's still pretty easy) and your nose will be very thankful later on that you didn't fuck it up as bad as i did mine. Literally within 2 hits of smoking it i figured it out, its super easy.

I think we should all agree that fentanyl is extremely dangerous and destructive to all opiate addicts.  I personally don‚Äôt get how fent is some people‚Äôs favorite opiate high bc it doesn‚Äôt last long(in most cases), is synthetic and borderline anesthetic whereas heroin or oxy quote unquote REAL OPIATES have more euphoria and a good nod and seem more suited to be a recreational drug. I saw someone say that old heads are anti fent whereas young guys are pro. I‚Äôm actually pretty young and started using a couple years ago when fent was first coming up I was 17-20 when I first started using I was lucky and had a great plug that was selling real China which is practically a myth now in my area and maybe it had fent in it but I doubt it bc it probably would of killed me eventually I switched to tar which wasn‚Äôt as good but was still familiar and I smoked and banged it for a year I went to detox three times and relapsed in between when I finally tried real fent at first I liked it bc I wasn‚Äôt sick and I was really high but as the high wore on the nod was cold and uncomfortable it wore off rather quickly and I decided like all junkies do to do another shot I immediately fell out and had to be revived. That scared me off fent for awhile but eventually I got stuck with it again bc tar is becoming scarce and fent and other analogues are basically what dope is out here. I played it safe this time but still the high was trash yes I was fucked up and not sick but it was just uncomfortable and strange I kept doing it for awhile but eventually I decided it wasn‚Äôt worth it and went to detox I relapsed when I got out and now I‚Äôve been on subs for a decent amount of time. I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that some people really like fent but lots would prefer decent quality heroin I think fent is a last resort drug when your tolerance is through the roof and you don‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. I get that people like it but I do believe it‚Äôs an evil drug that has few good qualities and isn‚Äôt suited to recreational use. Does anyone else agree with this?

10 x 8mg/2mg Suboxone 
7g Marijuana

On Monday I'm going to buy 3g of dope as a last hurrah, and after that, I'm gonna settle in for the withdrawals. I've actually made an effort this time to spend the time leading up to my withdrawals creating a more positive headspace, because that makes a big difference for me. I've completely cleaned my apartment, because when I'm sick I have absolutely no energy/desire to clean up after myself. I've stocked my fridge and pantry with plenty of food that I enjoy and that is easy/fast to make, because cooking is also a no-go when sick. I also started my yearly bulking cycle around 3 weeks ago, so I'm doing 500mg of Testosterone Enanthate once a week and 30mg of Dianabol daily, and I feel confident the extra energy is going to carry over through my withdrawals and PAWS.

To be totally honest, I'm kinda happy/relieved this is happening. I've tried to quit so many times, but after 3 or 4 days like clockwork I end up caving, calling my boy, and making the 20 minute drive to go pick up. A little over a month ago I went on vacation with my family, and I ended up being perfectly functional on 2mg of Suboxone a day, mostly because I knew there was no way for me to get dope even if I wanted to. I feel lucky that I am being put in a position where I'm being forced into getting clean, but I have plenty of time and resources to prepare.

Wish me luck guys. And please don't leave half a dozen comments below telling me to get some kratom, kratom is shit and does absolutely nothing for me lol",1570329285.0

I would snort and 1/8 of a pill twice a week. But the chipping just didn't work out for me. Every day would just feel so boring when I wasn't getting high, it felt like the only thing I could think about was my next pill. So I decided to quit. I decided to go out with a bang and just binge until the bag was up and after that I would never pick up again. So I did a couple lines every afternoon for like two weeks. During the last couple days I noticed my tolerance start to increase, and I told myself that I should take a T break to avoid a permanent tolerance increase, but I couldn't do it. It got to the point where I hid my last pill out in the shed so I wouldn't get it for another  four days, but later that night at like 1 in the morning I crept past my parent‚Äôs room while they were asleep, snuck out of the house out to the shed and snuck back in. My own junkie-like behavior scared me, I considered myself to not have an addictive personality. Things like porn or weed I could do for days and then just stop for weeks either because I was too busy or just forgot to do it. But this wasn't like that. I crushed up my last pill into 2 lines and did them both. I layed in bed and drifted into an opiate-induced blissful slumber. I woke up the next day and went to school. I was texting my friend in 2nd period and he texted me something about a kid at our school OD'ing on pills, how it had happened recently, I searched it up and sure enough there was a news story posted at 2 am last night about how a kid in my grade OD'ed on fent pressed M-box 30s. Literally the same batch I did. A voice played on the intercom for all teachers to read out loud the school-wide email, so my math teacher did, explaining what happened and then he played the attached news story. The whole thing took about 5 minutes, then the bell rang and everyone went to their next classes and acted like nothing happened. The next day we had our school spirit week assembly, it would have been a perfect opportunity for the principal to say anything about what happened, tell us what/why this is happening or to be careful, or at least have a moment of silence. But no, he didn't even mention the fucking kid's name. This is not an isolated occurence, 141 people have died from these fent percs in my city since june (mostly homeless people) and the news didn't even start covering it until 5 highschoolers died just this month in our district. Last year we had a fucking 1 hour assembly because some girl posted blackface on snapchat. Basically so our dickhead principal could virtue signal to us how ""socially conscious"" he is and tell us that ""racism is bad, you guys"". But a kid actually died this time, and all we could get is a fucking 5 minute video?! Me and my friend made an appointment with a substance counselor to see if we could implement free fentanyl test strips in our school's Teen Health Center, or at least one Narcan for every defibrillator. We also need to have some kind of mandatory education about how to recognize the 6 signs of an OD or how to administer Naloxone. He said I have to work with our school‚Äôs substance abuse prevention club to contact the district and OK it through them. I told my mom what I was doing and explained what harm reduction was and she flipped out, said I was condoning drug use and to just say no and that there‚Äôs no such thing as safe drug use and what not. Imagine sucking Reagan‚Äôs cock that hard. Anyway, I‚Äôm not going to be doing any opiates for a long time except for the opium I grow myself. Unless of course a lifetime supply of heroin falls out of a plane into my backyard tomorrow. It‚Äôs a little harder than I thought, I must say;despite zero withdrawal symptoms I have occasionally triggers, like the music I would listen to while high or receipts like the ones I would crush my pills with. But not having anything near me where I can use it alleviated 98% of the psychological temptation to use. Anyway, what do you guys think are some good ways to keep the kids at my school safe? Also, what are some tips on staying clean and what do you guys do instead when you feel like getting high?",1570325406.0
ddw9mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ddw9mc/im_feeling_really_guilty/,18,https://redd.it/ddw9mc,,I‚Äôm feeling really guilty.,"I just got off subs 13 weeks ago after over 4 years on it. It was insanely hard. I was abusing vicoprofen 7.5mg prior to subs but not to a point of addiction. 

Being that subs are an opiate, it had numbed the pain I had that I was on pain medication for. After a few weeks off suboxone, the pain returned and my mom has 5mg Oxycodone for her chronic pain. It started with 1. Then here and there it was 2. Then 3. And I just took a 4th today. So 20mg for the first time yet in one day (no she doesn‚Äôt know). It‚Äôs been about 3-4 weeks of taking the Oxycodone. 

I need to stop and I need to stop now. This isn‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm so upset with myself. I‚Äôm so disappointed. I worked so hard getting off suboxone and now I‚Äôm enjoying the Oxycodone. I‚Äôm going to tell her to hide them and not give me any. I just feel so damn guilty and am hating myself to be honest. 

I just needed to tell someone that doesn‚Äôt know me and this was the only place I knew to go.

**Edit:** I knew no one would judge me but I felt I needed to ask that no one did but I have since edited this post and got rid of that part. 

If you haven‚Äôt seen in the comments, I did end up telling my mom and got it off my chest. She wasn‚Äôt mad or upset with me. I knew she wouldn‚Äôt be but I was still afraid to tell her. She has since hid her Oxycodone and unless I‚Äôm in genuine pain, I‚Äôm stopping. I can‚Äôt let this keep going. It‚Äôs going to probably take a few days to shut my mind up but I know and need to remind myself that getting off Suboxone after 4.5 years of being addicted to it is likely 10x harder than this especially since I‚Äôve really only taken 2-3 of the Oxy‚Äôs for 3 weeks. If you want my story about how I ended up in Suboxone, just send me a chat. I already have it written out because I‚Äôve had to explain it so many times, I‚Äôd be more than happy to share it with you.  

I am happy I came and decided to post here. You all have been so kind and made me feel a lot better. Addiction sucks. The stigma behind it sucks. But to have a subreddit like this that enables support from strangers who understand how you feel is really comforting. So, thank you to everyone who has and who continues to reply to this. It means so much to me to have and read the encouragement from ya‚Äôll. 

One last thing, if anyone else needs support or just wants someone to talk to, please just send me a chat (I just prefer chat because I can see what was said prior when I respond where as DMing hides the message when I go to reply that I had originally received which then makes me forget what I‚Äôm even replying to lmao). I‚Äôd be more than happy to help anyone as best I can without any judgement and just as a stranger to vent to/get whatever you need to get off of your chest that you can‚Äôt bring yourself to tell anyone else. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be drug related. If it helps, I‚Äôm a 29F. So for instance, if you have just general girl problems and need another girl to talk to, I‚Äôm here! Of course I‚Äôd be happy to help any males, too!ü§òüèº",1570323222.0

Everyone is telling me to move on and find someone new, but I'm so freaked out about getting into another bad situation that it just isn't worth it for me.  

It's not like I didn't give NA a chance either. I kept with it for over a year, accepted relapses, and worked the program as best I could despite my horrible issues with sponsorship. 

What I've found/learned for myself is that Narcotics Anonymous is a suggestion. It is not a MUST for sobriety. I think using Narcotics Anonymous in conjunction with things like medication, therapy, and positive activities is the key to getting clean.

After a one year heroin binge, with a casual 6 day break in between I decided that tomorrow will be the day I will start my recovery.

I will live at my sisters place for a week since she's gone and I will use the time to get through the first steps of WD.
Today I stock up on 33mg clonazepam and a little bit of lope to get through the worst of it.

The place is perfect for WD. No it's a nice appartment in the Countyside 40km away from all of my connects, and since I won't be able to cop anyway I decided to use this opportunity to stop for good.

I also stocked up on comfort food and will take care of her adorable cats to keep myself busy. Netflix and Games will help me through aswell.
I feel like I'm ready for this this time.

Also the heroin around here is bad as fuck, since I can use 2 grams and not even nod.

Sorry for the roman, but wish me luck my friends. I Know I can do it this time!

I hope everyone is having a good day, stay strong my friends.

Any tips or help would be highly appreciated!

Peace out!",1570273922.0

Now I was a little taken aback but his face tattoos gave me a little comfort so I told him I indeed did do boy. Now i live in a city in the southeast in the volunteer state so this is not common .

Anyways this fine gentleman informs me he literally just pulled into town from a way up north near 8 mile and was about to take a piss but I should go hop in the backseat of his car with his amigo.

People were denied post op meds, people suffered and people committed suicide due to pain. 

Many States changed their opioid prescription protocols and people were fucked. 

The pharmacies gave people shit and didn‚Äôt do
Their job and the whole society of legit chronic pain patients were targeted and abused. 

Well.. a few months ago the authors of those guidelines wrote a letter stating that the medical industry misapplied and them. Basically they said doctors weren‚Äôt supposed to cut legit pain patients people off. They weren‚Äôt supposed to deny people proper care. And even hospitals gave people bullshit meds after operations. Again people suffered and some blew their brains out cause they couldn‚Äôt handle the pain.

What do you guys think? Any stories you care to share about suffering unnecessarily and being treated terribly? I‚Äôve have multiple serious operations and I was treated horribly by a few doctors trying to get into pain management.

I took soma aka carisoprodol many times, and it felt good because it relieved anxiety just as good as my xanax,, Anyways I learned soma are very very popular to mix with opiates and often dangerous. So i've done the mix with codeine and hydrocodone, and it is very unpredictable most of the time i randomly pass out. But so i llowered my dosage to 1,400 soma with 240 of codeine which i'm lucky that im on one those that it converts to morphine. So before i am getting confused my main question was, do you like mixing with soma and higher doses of codeine, if so why or why not? And do they have a synergestic effect like make the effects stronger or even longer? What do you think of the combo, soma by itself codeine by itself, or together (which I know is considered popular) But why, does it last longer or do the effects increeae of one or both? Thanks it's been 30 minutes since i took 300 mg codeine and 1400mg of soma, i always have low tolerance to both and sometimes take higher doses but i randomly pass out?/ Thanks!",1570239561.0

I was laughing with my plug today about my dumbass and how I always lose my pills. I ended up finding them and we determined Junkie Jesus is a real thing lol! Figured I would share the story with y'all. Can anyone relate? 

So this morning I arrived at work. I always show up early so I can have a little time to myself in my car. Usually I will listen to a podcast, do a line and then get started on my day. This morning was no different. I was sitting in my car and did a line. I had a crystal clear memory of putting my pills inside of my wallet. However about an hour into work I went to grab my pills and they were gone. 

I panicked and dumped my purse out. I couldn't find them anywhere. My boss asked what I was doing and so I told him I was looking for my migraine meds. I told him I was going to check my car and so I went outside and tore it apart. Nothing. I thought maybe I had dropped them outside of my car when I got out... but I didn't see them on the ground. No one had parked next to me yet, so unless someone came and left in that hour window of time from when I parked and realized I was missing my pills, it didn't seem that's what happened.

I came back into the office and my boss told me to go home and get my meds. I kept telling him it was okay but he was persistent (turns out he wanted me to go to Starbucks for him anyway ha). So I texted my plug if I could come meet him to replace what I lost. I drove to see him and told him what happened. As mentioned above we were laughing at how I always do this (I literally did it yesterday too and have yet to find those pills). 

I come back to work and sit down at my desk. I got a call from a lead and I grabbed the form I take notes on when talking with a lead from a pile of them I keep on my desk. Right under that form were my pills. Y'all I have absolutely no memory of taking them out and putting them there. When I went to grab them out of my wallet I immediately realized I was missing them...so I must have mindlessly done it at some point and just don't remember! 

My memory is really bad due to seizures that I've had (possibly undiagnosed epilepsy) and on top of that I am extremely tired today. Last night I was sleeping and awoken by a loud crash outside my bedroom window. I looked out and on the main street in front of my apartment I saw a white SUV slammed into a tree. It didn't take long for it to catch fire. Of course I called 911. They were already on their way. The person unfortunately didn't make it because they were trapped. All the commotion kept me up and then I wasn't ever really able to fall back asleep. My point is that I guess it's not impossible that I absentmindedly grabbed them and put them there. 

So I texted my plug and he was like, ""I guess Junkie Jesus does exist!"" Bahaha.",1570227672.0

ddbpfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ddbpfx/i_just_mega_dosed_tianeptine_sodium_heres_the/,8,https://redd.it/ddbpfx,psychonaut4020,I just mega dosed tianeptine sodium. Here's the results.,"A tiny bit of background. I've been an opiate user since I was about 14 I started with hydrocodone and since then I've done jus about every opioid drug under the sun except for pandas. I've done tianeptine in the past but the most I did at a time was 180mg. I even went through withdrawals after only taking it for a week in a row. And that was hell cause I was also coming down from u-47700(dont fucking touch that shit pls). So this time I'm being extra careful and letting a non drug using friend hold onto my Tia and only giving it to me every 2-3 days for a single dose. 

I should also add that I have a very large kratom tolerance. For each dose I take 10 grams 3 times a day(yeah I know it's a pretty large amount..) so now u have an idea for my tolerance sorta. 

And now that we're caught up on my plan and history and tolly I'll tell you the dose I took today. I weighed 500mg and put it into a capsule for easy consumption. Normally tianeptine sodium take only 15 mins to kick into high gear. But this time was weird it took about 30-40 mins to kick into high gear. Which is definitely odd for sodium but oh well haha. And lemme tell you this... The goddamn rush I got from this was comparable to the rush from heroin (I should add that when I say heroin I mean kinda decent heroin not super amazing heroin) but still the rush is great. Right now at about 1.2 hours in I'm feeling the nice warmth I've come to love from opiates. I know it won't last but I'll enjoy it while I'm able to. The mental and visual clarity I'm getting is unreal. I really love this stuff. Your mileage may vary though.

I do want to add that I do not recommend taking this drug ever and I definitely don't recommend taking this high of a dose. Kicking this stuff will be extremely difficult for just about anyone. If you do use Tia I'd do what I'm doing and let someone else hold onto your stash.",1570215338.0

Please note, I was passed out in a jail cell for over 8 hours. The last thing I remember was getting into the cop car and being detained. Then I briefly recall getting my blood drawn and was left in the drunk tank waking up in a pool of sweat 8 hours later. No narcan or first aid was administered to me at any point as per the police report. I nodded out and got into a fender bender and as the police arrived I took 5 Xanax bars that I had on me to avoid a possession charge.

We will burn every last goddamn bridge down into the ground if it means keeping us from getting sick. 

I'm thoroughly convinced that the apple truly does not fall far from the tree. My dad was also a heroin addict in his early years, however, I won't pretend that this was a fate chosen by anyone other than myself. He was able to quit cold turkey after shooting for 5 years and is still sober 30 years later; so what is to stop me from doing that after snorting for only 2 years?  So I've decided to cut dope out of my life, I'm sick of pissing away cash just to put half a bundle up my nostril over the span of 24hrs every Goddamn day. And for what? to bury my emotions? To stair off into the fucking void instead of processing things like a normal human?

I decided to quit.

After wiping my bank account, isolating me from my friends, my family, my hobbies, Heroin gives me one last parting kiss of death, twisting at the bones and ripping at the muscles, the convulsions, the diarrhea, the restless nights.... Opiate withdrawals are miserable, but like everything in this world, these feelings, they‚Äôre fleeting and ephemeral and in the long run, what I'm hoping is that this isn't something that will even be worth remembering in a few years time. 

&#x200B;

Day 1:

 I could feel my bones aching, I was nauseous and delirious, but I was in good spirits; it was decided, I was going to fight back and ride out the misery that was to come ahead. I have a history of not following through till the end on every and anything...So I was suspicious of my own high hopes. None the less, I stuck in there, called in sick with the ""flu"" and stuck through a restless night knowing that I will only start feeling better with time. 

&#x200B;

Day 2: 

I do some research, order mineral suplements, 5htp, L Tyrosine amino acids (thanks for the next day shipping, Bezos), things aren't getting much better but I am preparing for day 4 as I will need to get back to work if I am to pay my bills. Sleep did not get any easier. 20 minutes passed out, BOOM legs on fire, I have to piss, joints ache just standing up from the bed... and in just a few minutes time, on my way back from the bathroom, it's back to bed, start the same ""war of getting comfortable"" all over again. This proved to be my hardest night so far when it came to withdrawal symptoms. 

&#x200B;

Day 3:

 Every Goddamn symptom is still lingering, I don't know what to do, but sit around and wait for these pains to go away.  I have to thank a youtube channel ""Crime Pays, But Botany Doesn't"" and Brad from Bon Apetite (although I couldn't find myself able to put down more than ramen broth) for helping me get through these troubling times. Sleep was a struggle but the war was less intense. I feel like my body was slowly coming to call an armistice... 

&#x200B;

Day 4: 

I wake up, Feeling like shit and potentially suffering from a lack of sleep, I decide to call in ""good to go"" and take my vitamin pack that's supposed to help  me feel happy (it worked fairly well). I get through an 8hr day than head home, I had thrown away all my gear at this point, but after a few glasses of wine, I was feeling the most intense cravings for heroin I had felt this far. I immediately unblocked my guys number and called him up, I tell him to come through and bring some dope. I told him that  I would give him 60 usd for a 10 sack, etc etc. Fortunately he knew I was cleaning up and didn't take the bait  (I had a friend who would run for the dope, was not a dealer). I took 300mg of Kratom, thrashed about and waited for it to kick. At this point, prior to it kicking, I would have snorted anything that was put in my face just with the fucking hope that maybe a bit of heroin was in it... Thank God, the kratom took the edge off of everything. afterwards I called and told him to come over dry. Regardless of bringing heroin buddies back into the fold, I just needed somebody to talk too, I couldn't let my family know I was a dope fiend, neither my friends; they looked at me as the success case who didn't need a degree, dropped out of college and found gainful employment. My sister looked up to me, and so did so many of the people I grew up with. None the less, as an introvert and a junkie I had nobody else to turn too. So my buddy came through and fortunately brought me tramadol and not dope. I took it last night and it knocked me the fuck out, not bad.

Day 5:

Wake up, feel like crap. For a company event, I had a whiskey tasting tonight. I was nervous about me acting up after loosening up with a bit of booze because I knew what happened the night before. Kratom Helped last time... So I took 300 mg of Kratom and my vitamins and supplements in the morning, got to work for the half day, than got dressed up to get messed up. I'm home now, and honestly it's a goddamn blessing that I don't have the craving I did yesterday, especially after drinking so much. It was alot of fun to socialize and bullshit with people who are worth so much goddamn more than me.

I rationalized with myself and I don't know if it is just some fog clearing up, but tonight, I called a fraternity brother from my college days that I do respect and spend time with regularly. I told him everything. He told me a mutual brother's sibling (that was a good friend) died from an oxy overdose. Maybe it's just my ego, but I didn't want to burden another person with my own demons, but he's happy to help keep me accountable and will check my pupils when I'm hanging around with him. This sounds really fucking silly but another person letting me know they cared about me helped so fucking much. 

Sleep got easier last night (although I still spent fucking 4 hours tossing and turning from 7am-11am) life will get better and hopefully for my savings and relationships, I will find a way to restore those. If I've learned anything, it's to quit, you better fucking want it for yourself, or detox won't mean shit and a relapse is imminent. This has been by far the biggest slap in the balls I've had to deal with in a minute, and even as the guy who can't finish anything... I'm hoping, I am fighting, to make sure that I can put an end to my heroin use. I've found alot of good information in this subreddit that's helped along the way. If you feel like getting off the dope, don't be shy, shoot me a message. I have a long road ahead, but I can atleast share with you what helped me get over (presumably) the worst of things. I'm in such a nascent stage of recovery, but I can promise to you that things will only get easier.",1570167810.0

Like lightning was flowing through me so much that I couldn't stay so for more then 3-4 seconds, but I felt like I was too exhausted to even move at the same time. And I never vomited or had any sort of stomach cramping, besides the runs.

Then I quit for a couple months, and when I picked it back up, for some reason I never seemed to get the restlessness again or the feeling of electricity flowing through my muscles. My main symptom since then has been tons of vomiting and stomach cramps, literally making me feel like I have two stomachs battling inside me. Even when I started shooting up, for some reason I never seemed to get as sick as I did when I was smoking the first time around.

I have friends who have said their symptoms changed over time, but they always say it gets harder and harder to deal with. I feel like the vomiting is way easier to deal with than the fatigue riddled restlessness.

What experiences have y'all had with fluctuating symptoms, and does anyone know why it can change over time like that?",1570166489.0

Opiates make me feel very in touch with my emotions in a way that i normally am not. 

The way i described to a friend is that it feels like a dam has been freed up and now a river of all of these emotions i have pent up over the course of the day/many days/weeks/etc come flowing in. It is sometimes melancholic (though not sad, if that makes sense), often times feeling of gratitude or love or anything else that i have just been repressing 

Was wondering if this was a shared experience among the category of drugs? Is there a name for this?",1570165828.0

Did i almost OD?,"Been fucking with the same plug fir the last 3 months. Dope is pretty consistent. I been working on the same batch for the last week so I know the problem isnt the dope itself. The last shot i went to do was particularly fat and i always push my shots in about 10-20 units at a time to avoid an OD because i eyeball my dose. Well im glad i do that because I pulled up a pretty big rock in 40 units and pushed 20-25 in and got a hellacious rush and my lips and face got this really weird pins and needles sensation in them and it fucking hurt bad. Ive shot lots of morphine before and ive never ever enjoyed the pins and needles sensation it gives. My wife loves it and says it hurts so good and i know many people enjoy the pins sensation but i dont. It felt really weird and i wasnt expecting it i havent ever felt pins and needles off this dudes heroin and i been doing the same batch for a week now and im left to conclude i got that sensation because i did too much dope. I pulled the needle out and left the other 20 units in it and my pupils were super pinned and I felt very very high. I havent been that high in a while and my tolerance is very very high.

Im just wondering if this means I almost overdosed or what it means exactly when u do a shot so big that u get pins and needles and they hurt a lot. Been a few hours since I did any, and honestly am kind of afraid to do my next shot even tho it is much much smaller.

Any input? Did i just overdo it guys? What happened?

TL:DR Did a super fat shot and got a painful pins and needles sensation in my lips and face and it was definetly not the dope. I been doing this same dope for a week and the dope does not ever give a pins sensation when doing a normal amount. Did i almost OD?",1570159300.0

Dope money ran out , no disability or gov checks ,finally scored a methadone script 150 a month but i need a little extra so im still stuck buying some liquid each month but its nothing compared to a g+ a day.. 

Oxycontin is all that has ever worked for me , im feeling its impossible now to obtain them but the other day im my local paper a man without a pharmacist license ordered 170k oxys from the manufacturer.....BUT THE GUIDELINES STOP ME FROM GETTING ANYTHING? 

They cut my xanax because i got the methadone script but I was in  high school broken ass body on.  80mg Oc IR 30mg gabapentin,xanax,soma and now i cant get soma w my methadone bcuz ""they will look 2 narcotics one person"" one of the local dealers goes to same doc (but for 10 yrs) and gets a literal bag of pharmas to go home with each month while i contemplate if any, all this is ever worth it to endure this pain 

I heard today only 48 states have the I-Stop program in place ..maybe i can go to another state? Each month? Ugh might not even be worth it  all i know it methadone dont hold me right",1570159155.0

The first day, I assumed that police were just looking for someone with a warrant..
Then today they were there again... i went in to the clinic and everyone was scared to leave, when I asked what the deal was with the cops, everyone heard the sirens go off and the cops pull off after someone out of the lot -

‚ÄúWell, looks like they found whoever they‚Äôre looking for!‚Äù

And i ask ‚Äúoh, so they were looking for someone in-particular?‚Äù

And this older guy who i dont know from a hole-in-the-wall said :
‚ÄúNo thats about the 3rd time in the past 15mins they‚Äôve pulled someone over after pulling out of the lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? Why??‚Äù

‚ÄúTryna give people DUI‚Äôs for driving on methadone...‚Äù

This can‚Äôt seriously be what they‚Äôre choosing to use their time doing, can it? Surely they have better things to do...

Even the idea of them doing this disgusted me to my core - as much of a joke as it may sound, methadone clinics are SUPPOSED to be a safe place for addicts that have at least some desire to get better when it comes to this shit.

Anyway, what do yall think the odds are that dude was right?
I sincerely hope they were just looking for someone with a warrant (even though i still think thats petty as fuck)",1570158186.0
