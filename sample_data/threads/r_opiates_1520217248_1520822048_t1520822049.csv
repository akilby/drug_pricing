Need all ya'lls opinions. Vote here!,"Confusing title, but here's the deal:  I had a relatively brief but intense run with h/fent.  Using one 8mg sub to detox.  Down to .5 sub per day, and tomorrow is my last day.  I'm hoping that I can come off ok, but based on how I feel before I take my sub each day, I think there will be residual sickness.  I have to get through work/family/life.  Here are my options:

1.  Just use pregabalin/Xanax until it passes (my preference, time to empty the receptors)
2.  Use small amounts of tramodol (like 150mg split into 2 doses throughout the day) for a day or two. 
3.   Use small amounts of Kratom for a day or two (not my preference, I dont love it.  But it's effective)
4.   Use lope.  I have easy access to it.  Never used it And don't know much about it.

EDIT. TOP is not suitable to replace short term painkillers because of its components long half lives. some of those componemts prevent overdoses like one which imduces vomiting at high doses. Its just so much safer and cheaper for USA.

Since I didn't shoot it, or go out and buy dope.


Shit's been rather good since I got clean, almost shocked at how fast my life has turned around in a month. After getting laid off, I now make far more money then I ever did at that job, and it's all tax free (but legit, I'm supposed to pay taxes eventually). 


No I am not a stripper. My dick is too small, and my tits are too big.


But on that same note, I've lost over 15 pound in the last month, about 30 over 4 months. I always, lose weight when I get off dope, and always balloon when I get on it.


That being also said, hopefully my body will be beach sexy in a month (or at least above ground pool sexy). Since I'm going to [redacted] country on a vacation, to which I actually am able to pay for (holy fuck). I learned that prositution is basically legal, I never knew how many countries either had it legal, or didn't care, in the Americas (and well pretty much everywhere, IDK how I fell into this prostitution rabbit hole, I liteerally have more interest in the law aspect of it, then actually....you know,  hoho! (oh... see what I did there?)


No that isn't my primary reason to go there, I wanted to see monkeys, that was my reasoning. Then I learned this after the fact....hey quit looking at me like that. I was absolutly not planning on having sex with the monkeys. Dammit, I should just stop tying, o well too late. backspace is broken because I said it is.

I never thought in my life i'd be able to afford another trip. But hotel's been paid for, visa is in order, tickets almost bought. So expect some cool pics around my 60 day update!


If anyone can guess the country, I throw like 5 dollar btc your way for lulz, just felt like making it entertaining around here for you guys, since when has there been any kind of contest or fun here?

1 guess per person, don't be a dick and make multiple accounts. It's just for fun, and only 5 bucks, come on don't be a dick.

194 chances! gogogo


**rule addenmun edit:**

So to put a sense of urgency, and add more fun, I decided to put a dead line, let's say exactly 1pm, eastern standard time, you win! I had in my head 3 countries I'd go to (in case no one guessed it, maybe should have mentioned that, but o well lol) New Zealand.  So someone is going to win, or I can send you fent test kits, I got a pack of 10 coming, I will send 5 or 5 dollars 

hell I may do 2 prizes, not sure yet, depends if the strips come in, I aint rich! one 5 dollar, one 5 pack of fent strips in bit coin, your choice if you win, runner up gets the other (fent strips havn't got here yet, so if they do not come in a reasonable amount of time, should be today, $5 with default, offer valid in 194 counties, not valid in DPRK, unless you got monies.)


Also, if no one get it by midnight tonight, eastern time, you can guess again before 1PM. :) Why am I doing this?! I'm just fucking bonkers today, this is cool by the mods right?


if this works out, I'll do more fent strip give aways and btc give away in the future (nothing insane, like no more then 5 dollars, or I may just order a ton of fent strips and do that).  The fent epidemic is something I'm completely unfamiliar about, we don't really see fent down here, but I've met people personally effected by it. So it scares the shizzle outta me. I think one of the steps is servicework? Consider this kinda that?


**CONTEST OVER, WE HAVE A WEINER**: u/achemicaIreaction claim yo prize foo! Stand by u/drugstorecowbro for a second prize in time, or if he doesn't give me a response in a day. I'll be staying a block away from Trumps Silver Weiner overlooking the Pacific!


really the point of this, I just wanted to share some positivity that's been going on in my life, with you guys. hope you had a larf!

When it's up to me, I'll always grab hydromorph contins - the big capsules full of tiny beads - and crush and snort them. I'm not a needle person, so the intranasal way has always worked fine for me. However, I recently got my hands on some low mg hydromorphone pills (I guess they're dilaudid), 4 and 5mgs. 

The first time I had them a couple of months ago, I tried to snort one but it's just too much powder compared to the little crushed beads I'm used to. So I ended up just eating most of them (not all at once lol, just over the course of the week or whatever), and like, it sort of worked, but I was munching them every couple of hours and was just sort of ""well"" as opposed to high. 

Anyways, so this time I got the 4mg dilaudid again, and both yesterday and today I plugged 3 of them when I got up. This morning I plugged the 3 and then was able to lie on my bed for 10 or so minutes while I waited, and I actually felt that wonderful, warm opiate come-up buzz! I used to get that nice come-up feeling when taking percocets when I was younger, and that feeling is probably what attracted me to opiates in the first place. I didn't even think I could get that feeling anymore, so it was quite a pleasant surprise! 

Anyways, I made an alt account just to share this because I had to tell someone. So if anyone out there is considering plugging but is feeling deterred by the idea of putting something in your butt, I'm just here to vouch for it. I'm feeling *quite* nice and high now, and it's been about an hour and a half since I dosed.

A good, ""trusted"" dealer gave them to me (market price too) giving me the story they came from a friend who had a pharmacy connection.  He's been a great dealer for about bhalf a year now, btw.  But with Percs.  His source dried up (thanks Sessions) and this new contact came in.  He reassured me 100% trustable.  But you know how that is.

Anyway, I didn't have strips to test, so sampled a half of a quarter of a 30 mg pill (like 4 mgs).  It hit almost immediately, but didn't have any euphoric effect.  Still felt something lacking in my gut.  But did something, felt intense...but like a downer with intent.  Every fiber of me felt it.  It stopped the cravings in my gut for an hour or two.  I have no idea how to describe it other than it temp. shut down dope cravings and sort of felt good for an hour?  Then felt ""heavy"" and non-euphoric but was doing something and that lasted another few to four hours.

So the next day I did a quarter (7 to 8 mgs).  Same but more intense.  At this point I thought it was all in my head since I was used to Percosets and Morphine.  Maybe it was a brand switch?  But Oxys are supposed to be amazing, and they are dereived from same dope. Right?

Next day I did half a 30mg pill.  All day (7 hrs), I had the feeling I was still going through withdrawls from my previous Persoset supply being cut short (tapered off to 7 mgs a day though) and thought the Roxys would totally help, but they weren't, but I was feeling super intense and focused, but off at the same time. Which sucked as I was in an important biz mtg.  I tried to sleep as I felt insanely tired, but could not slow myself down for a nap.  Weird.

So the withdrawls continued to claw at my gut today, but I felt this heavy feeling again when I took a quarter of the A-215s.  So I texted my friend to see what was up with him.  My friend who went in on the buy says the same.  We both do believe they aren't Roxys.  We met tonight and discussed it for a few hours and we think it's not just in our heads.  But damn they seem/look legit, and this dealer is too.  If not Fent, what other crap can they be pressed with?  What have we been taking?  Hopefully not Fent + benzos + Adderall or something.  All hard to get off of.  But hey, look where I'm posting.

They look perfect.  Good speckling, cut in half...the right color inside.  They taste bitter when you lick them (but not overwhelming).

They only strange thing is when you cut them with a knife, they are rock hard.  Seems weird. Takes some muscle to cut them into fourths.  Is that normal?  Part of me thinks we found someone really good at the pill press with Adderal mixed with Xanax or baby power or something with a dash of Fent. 

Testing a pill for Fent tomorrow (my friend is picking up strips).  Fuck this.  The whole three days I've been in withdrawls despite.  Only tonight took 7mgs of Morphine and SUDDENLY felt relief.  Roxys these are not.

823xs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/823xs8/bupetolerancedph_question/,2,https://redd.it/823xs8,AbanoR,Bupe/Tolerance/DPH question,"So I took my usual weekly hydrocodone and the usual potentiators (including DXM, Tagamet etc...), plus my IV benadryl. (I don‚Äôt need anyone telling me that that is dumb, I‚Äôve heard it all already). 

IVing the Dph has in the past always created a more intense experience since it comes on so much quicker. I also crush and dissolve the hydro in water so it hits quicker as well. I usually do 50mg of dph though, this time I did 100mg. I‚Äôve always enjoyed the sedation from that amount, even by itself though I don‚Äôt do that often. 

I didn‚Äôt get the feeling I had come to expect AT ALL and it was a dramatic change from previous experiences. I felt good for sure but it wasn‚Äôt anything like in the past, and I‚Äôd gotten pretty consistent results with my weekly ritual for at least a month and a half. Now, I have used some oxy I managed to get ahold of and extra lortabs over the past 2~3 weeks when normally I limit myself to Sunday night. I also took a sub yesterday at around noon (4mg). 

So my question is this, did I not get as high as I had come to expect:
1) Simply because of tolerance? Doing to much other stuff outside of my weekly indulgence? I wasn‚Äôt popping pills all day mind you, I just got high a few more times over those weeks than normal. Maybe two or three times a week. 

2) Because I took to much dph maybe? If there‚Äôs a sweet spot maybe I overshot it? I always figured that the more dph the stronger the opiate high but I guess there could be a point where it out muscles the opiates euphoria in favor of sedation. 

3) Or because the sub I took Saturday was still in my system and blocked some of the effects? I was told to wait 24-36 hours which I did but this still happened.  I took it several different ways only a small amount at a time because I was unfamiliar with it and because I just couldn‚Äôt seem to make the sublingual method work. 

It‚Äôs frustrating me because I have limited access to my DOC and not getting what I had come to expect is a real bummer. I know tolerance is a bitch, but I‚Äôm hoping y‚Äôall might be able to tell me if there is another reason, one that I could easily fix. Mind you, this wasn‚Äôt just a little less of a high, this almost felt like nothing and only lasted maybe an hour. My usual routine (which I‚Äôll post below), used to have me floating on cloud nine and you‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs a little weaker than what I did tonight. 

30-45~ minutes prior to opiates
75mg hydroxizine pamoate
25mg diphenhydramine 
1000mg Tagamet
1 naproxen sodium
1 big swig of DXM
Big glass of grapefruit juice and tonic water

With opiates: 50mg of hydrocodone. 
25mg hydroxizine pamoate
50~mg diphenhydramine IV
200mg Tagamet
1000mg of calcium carbonate
1 big swig of DXM. 

Next time I think I‚Äôm gonna do this down to a T after a little tolerance break and compare results but for now I‚Äôd love some input on what might be the problem. ",1520230743.0

I have been collecting all of my medicine since i was 12.
When i was 12 my parents explained to me that the expiration dates on the medicine bottles of pills that are pressed mean absolutely nothing.
8 years later, when i am 20, i research this myself and find out that it is true

fast forward another 10 years

and i have saved every single medication since i was 12

So i have a lot of codeine, antibiotics, and a few other things (promethazine, benzos, allegra, prednisone, 5 cases of prescription ear drops, eye drops, low-doseage codeine,  and a few other things that are escaping my mind)

. I would be ok for a few months . Medication would be valuable in an apocalyptic scenario .

This is something that repeats over and over again in my head:
I dont wanna be sober if an apocalyptic , zombie, world-war, scenario occurred. so to speak. 

in theory it would actually be better to lay low highly medicated without moving therefore going undected . 

If you did not have your pharmaceuticals available before the scenario you wouldmost  ikely have less than 12 hours.

During the Blackout of 77 in New York City all of the stores were looted within a hour . People of the highest social standing were reduced to looters. Most people were looting things they needed. Others were doing it for fun. The hospital was over run with injuries from broken glass. Yet, not 1 body was found, despite gunshots being fired all night long, and the city being torn to pieces. Kids would also light buildings on fire for fun .

I dunno.

And dose for dose ratio it‚Äôs 1:1 hydrocodone:morphine oral, however morphine only has a bioavailability of *about* 30% orally?

So I‚Äôm theory considering strength and bioavailability it‚Äôd seems morphine is the weakest orally dosage wise of them all?

But I gotta share a lil story cause I'm high rn and honestly didn't think it would happen today.
So let's back up. 
I lost my biggest flow of income recently and was not prepared. My girl and I are gonna be going into wds no matter what pretty much but damn dog I wanted to prepare a little.

 So day before yesterday I got a half on credit from my main dude but I know full well I can't pay his ass back.
I'm riding the bus home and I see this dude and I just know, (you know when you know), that he fucks with opiates.
Young black dude, thuggish, got one eye, big ass pores, but he's doing alright,  decent clothes jewelry. 
He's in the seat in front of me so I pull out my phone and lean over and call my banks automated system, 
it's a robot bish named Maggie and her only job in the world is to remind me how broke I am. 
So I say,""yo can you talk?"" That's all Maggie does is talk, ""press # for more options you broke ass mafk"", she says.
""Aight"", I say, ""you talk to Keisha?, well shit you better. Old boy paid in full for them fingers."" (Now I got the dude in front of me's attention. )
 ""Aight og"", I say and hang up. 
Few seconds later the dude leans over, ""ay I know you fuck with that food, make a nigga some money."" 
I was like ""bet, gimme yo number""
Flash forward to today and I'm sick af and after all day all I can manage to get up is $16 I'm like fuck... so I call old boy and a woman answers.
She says ""she's his ex and they ain't together anymore.""
I'm like fuck, so after awhile, like 3 hrs later I'm thinking fuck it, I'm gonna try to cold cop wit $16 and I start walking toward the cheapest gas station in the hood. 15mins in to walking I get a call and it's the dude, he called his ex asking if I called for him.
He was right down the street pulled up in 20 mins and sold me a twamp (.2) for $16.
It's fenty forsure but I'm not complain for how little I got, we ain't sick that's fosho.

In my case it's not really the product althou my veins are getting scary, but the fact that this is my life now, i see almost nobody ... tried hanging up with my scratch crew last two week end but it feels weird :x i feel so empty despite having a job, some friend that are good one... havin lost my familiy (both parents) doesn't help .. but i dunno, sorry guys venting !! i needed that out of my chest ... sadly it only helps as a patch and a way too smaller one for the injury behind it.

Peace, y'al be safe .. it's not worth it, find someone who love you foreal ... love is the ONLY drugs we need, but we ALL need it ... life unfair to most people. <3

A fun way to divert resources away from dope.,"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520205927.0

*Paging purresident meff experts - /u/nosecandiez and /u/spinderella69 -- Please bless me with your knowledge.*

So I'm doing my once a pay period chip today...

I have my shitty heroin where .4 will barely get me where I want to be and I also have what wassupposedto be a gram of coke.

But, as you can probably guess, it fucking isn't.

It' a gram of what is obviously shitty meth. It smells like chemicals and tastes like ass. Now, because drug dealers don't exactly have a return policy I'm stuck with this shit.

I did a matchstick head sized bump as, I suppose, a test... And, okay, aside from the shaking hands and the fact I'm worried my overweight heart might explode *(I'm joking... more or less)* I'm okay doing this.

So, I guess my questions are as follows...

I'm obviously going to bang this shit, because, well, it's what I do. How much is an acceptable/safe amount to do based on my zero tolerance and the above report of the match-head bump?/

How many shots should I get out oh the just under a gram I have left?

Do I need to add heat to break it down in a spoon? For that matter is there anything special I need to know about banging da meff?

I'm saving the heroin for either the last shot, all nice and goofball-y, or as landing gear for when the well runs dry. Which is the better plan?

Lastly, how long between shots should I wait? I imagine it's gonna be fiend-y as fuck, so I'm hoping if I can make a scjedule  that'll help.

That's it ya'll.

There has been a couple very weird batches going around. I've gotten some like this, other ppl in my state. And my friend in the next state over.. Called me frantic the other night when he got something similar. 

I was buying fent off this dude for the past year. It was always white as snow, powder and clear in the rig. And it was fent for sure, as I tested it. Plus I always got pinned out, really warm, and super noddy. Well my plug was dry for half a day then picked up more. Now he always got the same thing. But everytime he reupped, I always did a tester shot first. Just because its fent i'm dealing with, and just incase something was not cut as much and too strong. Well thank fucking god I did because I prob would've died. 

I mixed the shot up, drew it up and only shot a tiny bit. Im talking like 5 units. All of a sudden, my heart started racing really fast. I was like ""ugh, great wtf is this""? Tried to be calm and not freak out totally, as this would make it worse. Then my heart started POUNDING. Wicked uncomfortably. Now I love shooting coke and speedballs. This was NOTHING like that at all. It was such a yucky feeling and just didnt feel right at all. I wouldn't have even thought there was any fent in it at all, besides the fact I was wicked sick before I did it.. But I got off E at least. It started to subside a little over time. But I still felt shaky and uppidy for a while after. 

There was another time something almost identical happened to me over this past summer. Bought it off one of my other dealers. But it was the same looking white powder. That time, the feeling came and went with the rush. Didn't linger for hours like this recent time. But that time, it made my pupils HUGE like I was rolling.

Ive shot dope/fent, coke, crack, ketamine, and molly before. And this weird ""fent"" or whatever the fuck it was.. Felt NOTHING like any of the other drugs Ive tried before. Has anyone else ever had stuff like this? 



TLDR; Was buying the same fent off this dude for almost a year. Got what was supposed to be fent, the same usual stuff I been doing (white powder, clear in the rig). But when I shot it, my heart started racing then pounding. Was mad jittery for like 2hrs after the shot. Out of 2 sketchy times this happened, one time my pupils turned to saucers.

I spent my hotel money for the day on getting my puppers from the pound. Spoiled him and his mammy then got me high with the rest. 

Last time I actually lived outside I had a boyfriend by my side, my puppers, and was an unattractive lardass. I had no worries. I'd be lying if I didn't say being a skinny 'attractive' single female alone doing this didn't scare the shit out of me. Minding my own business with the doggies I got two $20s from guys who were trying to persuade me in the benefits of scratching each other's backs. Figuring out how to get my point across to these types is something I need to do ASAP. 
'No, I will not hook up with you for money.' 
'No, I will not date you for money.' 'If I'm single or not is irrelevant to you but thanks for the $20! I'm going to snag some breakfast tacos for my boyfran with it.' 
'No, you cannot have my number.' 'Fine, I will take yours and promise to get ahold of you as soon as I get phone turned on and charged later. I absolutely promise!' 
'Absolutely fucking do not try to hug me just to see how my dog reacts to it.'
'NO MEANS NO EVEN FOR HUGS DUDE.' 
Trying to exploit me for my less than favorable situation is the lowest of the low but refusing to take the hint and keep lingering is a sure fire way to get socked in the nuts. I didn't sleep with my fine ass persistent dealers even during my sickest brokest moments, you honestly think I'ma cave for a dude giving me extremely creepy mccreeperson vibes to get a roof over my head for the night? You found me perfectly content in the freezing cold roofless. He needs better leverage or a rag with chloroform. 

I made the full and complete decision to put myself in this situation, have to sacrifice for a better future. Right? I left a warm cozy house with a big comfy bed for this shit. My animals were miserable and treated like Sarah McLaughlin could make a home visit. I constantly heard the lady I lived with telling people my younger dog shouldn't even be alive and if she physically seen him she'd welcome him with a bullet. Enough of that so called animal lover talk and eventually my dog started moping around as if he was suicidal. She constantly threatened calling animal control on me for my cats just for the sheer number I had, not because they were miserable or miss treated. For all of ours sanity I decided a week of semi roughing it was better than another minute in those conditions. She randomly gave me pain pills and bars whenever she had them so I'mma miss that perk for sure. 

I only have to survive til Wednesday morning than I won't have to worry about where I can charge my phone next. I'm worried I made a careless irreplaceable mistake making this decision that has been leading to more than usual stress which makes me want to use more. Catch 22 for sure. I have a support system but am being stubborn about accepting help because I want to handle it all myself for once. 

I'm either going to fail losing everything that matters to me all at once, try to get smart with the wrong creeper and end up in some real life episode of Criminal Minds, or steady stay high and just let the flow decide my fate. ",1520196100.0

I used to shoot all the drugs, and lots of them. Overdoses, seizures - The whole nine.

I stopped and life has done a complete 180. I'm in school and could not be doing better, employed, eating well, exercising, sleeping 9 hours per night...The list goes on.

I want to use hallucinogens again. In my mind, they are completely separate from all other drugs. I've never struggled to moderate my use of psychedelics. If anything, they seem to have anti-addictive, life-affirming properties. 

I want to hear opinions on this from former addicts. The standard 12-step rhetoric shuts this idea down immediately based on principle, but I am interested in a more rational discussion.

Have YOU been able to take hallucinogens sparingly, for personal enrichment, after a period of sobriety? 


Please, only respond if you struggled with addiction. I want firsthand reports. I've already read all of the medical studies pertaining to hallucinogens and addiction, those are not what I'm looking for.

Exams are only a couple of weeks away and I'm missing days of uni atm. But I just can't get myself out of bed. I try to counter the coke hangover with heroin but I ran out now and I'm afraid I'll buy some more coke if I hit up my dboy. It's a cluster fuck.



Using coke doesn't even feel good anymore! I don't feel any part of the rush, but nasty side effects and my tolerance has skyrocketed, not to mention how my arms look. It's expensive and I notice my attention span decreasing. Concentrating and grasping complex concepts is harder than usual. I've been sleeping and thinking about offing myself since I ran out of coke and money on Friday. Still, the cravings are irrationally intense. I've never experienced anything like this with opiates and it's fucking scary. As if my brain is hijacked. 




I know it'll pass, but even without the coke hangover pulling me down - what perspective is there for me? I might have a career lined up but life still isn't really enjoyable to me. Plus for how long will I keep a job with my addiction taking over the front seat every now and then? I feel socially isolated and can't talk to anyone about what I think and feel. My 'friends' don't know or don't care that I'm struggling with one more habit. And I wouldn't know what they could do if they cared. It's not like their knowledge of my addiction or depression makes them ask. It's only small talk and God, am I sick of small talk. 




One of my roommates is consistently trying to make me fall in love with him and is so busy with making good impressions that he doesn't notice what's going on with me. Not that he'd be any help, he's a little thick and has the bad habit of interpreting a woman's kindness as sexual interest. Another bad habit is to only see things in relation to himself, as if he was the center of my universe LOL. It'd be really hilarious if it wasn't so sad. We really don't fit as a couple, but he tries to spit out googled facts to show me that he too can sound smart. It's so pathetic. No one cares what's going on with *me*. And as long as I more or less function and pay my rent they don't have a reason to question if everything is okay.





My mom has multiple sclerosis and I always thought I could die in peace when she's gone. But nooo, my siblings rely on me way too much. There is no other family member that could help them. This whole family relies on me to keep them together and I don't know how I can get out of that responsibility. I don't wanna just pass on my pain to them when I die. They don't deserve that. But it's really  exhausting to live, being me. Especially with the knowledge that I'll be alone forever, only a spectator to life. I won't ever have a relationship or kids. Who would wanna put up with a depressed junkie? And how should I find out if no one comes close to me? 


Also, I miss my mom. We do talk on the phone almost every day but it's more me being there for her. I learned not to overshare as stress worsens her symptoms. So, my closest friend and ally has been taken away from me by this illness. There is no one else who loves me unconditionally and would wanna support me through all this. 




In any case, I thought about making all arrangements for my funeral beforehand, now. So that at least those things are in order for whenever I'll make a split second decision. Has any of you brought your affairs in order, just in case? Maybe 25 is too early, but considering I didn't wanna live when I was 6 it's long overdue. 




I'm sorry for rambling & shitposting, but I've been hanging around in bed since Friday, alone, either sleeping or crying and needed to vent. I'm aware I'm at my most pathetic and I hate myself for it. So please refrain from pointing out what a whiny piece of shit I am bc I already know. Thx for being here.

After reviewing my DM I decided the story was worth sharing with the rest of you. Enjoy.,"**DM** That shit was epic and as I am a fellow resident of _____ where the dog is always one crags list click and text away (actually more like one hundred when all your connects are out town and you are sifting to find the post that seems ""legit"" - with the number of click checks being inversely related to the time between sniffs/shots/drags/etc). 

I digress - just wanted to praise you for your work. Obviously, this dm probably seems quite rando but someone posted about how the sub is almost at 50k followers (def not a karma sloot move only b/c of the joy it brought me and hopefully others). I digress again - but the point being someone reminisced about that competition which took me to the best piece of writing I've found on the internet since our boi Donny T hijacked the ~~fourth reich~~ white house). 

I've been out of work for a week on ~~an unannounced vacation~~ sick leave as I try to pretend as though the this is all in my imagination (completely rational thing to do - you can't tell me otherwise). Long story short I was on a business trip last week couldn't bring my doggie with me on the plane cuz I'm a puss / did not realize how desperate I would be 36 hours later. Two days in the sweats and the ~~rock whale turds~~ shits started to hit real bad and I had to immediately book the next flight home at 430 am and miss the last three days of my work trip - by the time I left the hotel my asshole was a crater from the aforementioned baby turd that was two days over do and I thought my tv was talking to me for a solid hour (for context this process began last Tuesday after I'd already skipped the first day of the trip on Monday and curled in a ball in my hotel room (also puked everything I ate that day on the bed which was pretty much only chocolate nut pretzels needless to say that combination probably painted a poor picture for the hotel staff so I left a hefty tip seeing as they probably thought that the puke was actually dukie from one night stand with a hooker that specializes in acts such as the dirty Sanchez ..... and I haven't even mentioned the scene at the toilet). 

Since then I haven't not been back to work and I've just been texting in sick to my manager everyday last minute and then shutting off my phone with the thought that if I can't see his response it never happened (can you confirm if that works - you wrote the new gospel so you seem like a good person to ask). I totally don't work in an industry where that is acceptable and I'm dreading going back to work (as I stated I too am from ___ so if I'm gonna go in tomorrow aka today I would be getting ready in about ~~1 hr 48 minutes~~ 1 hr 19 minutes). Anyway reading your erotic rhymes made me feel a bit better through the dread that is now surfacing after a week far from reality. I ~~Now am~~ was in the process of getting high as fook on the doof (daer sdrawkcab) - those last three words are scrambled for some mind masturbation to start your lovely day). 

One last thank you and I sincerely hope to hear back from you. **End of DM**

Some cut outs where time is mentioned indicate slight changes from when I wrote the DM to when I am now posting for your pleasure obviously due to a slight elapse in time..

I don't have anyone to really vent to right now so I made this account in hopes I could find comfort in this community...

So I relapsed for a bit.  I was hiding it from my SO.  I had plans on getting clean.  ""Just one more bun...I'll get all the proper materials to help get through this withdrawal after this tough weekend at work.  It'll be fine.  No one will find out...""

Well, she caught me.  It's completely breaking my heart seeing her cry.  But, I'm too numb to cry myself.  I am sick to my stomach.  I feel horrible, and I'm definitely not proud.  I completely understand her being mad at me.  I lied.  This wasn't a small secret.  But it is kind of killing me that she can't be more understanding.  It's hard to just turn away forever once this shit comes into your life.  She has no faith in me right now and that hurts.  I didn't relapse to hurt her.  I relapsed in a moment of weakness.  I wanted to escape my life because honestly, I kind of hate it.  I'm depressed.  I'm constantly having anxiety attacks.  But a little dope helps me hide.  I can kick the shit out of the toughest days when I'm high.

She flushed it all down the toilet.  I still have to get through my work week.  I'm gonna have to figure out how I'm going to stand behind a bar for upwards 11 hours, making drinks for a crowd that is gonna be 4 deep basically until close.  She doesn't understand what I'm going to have to go through.  All she wants is for me to not be high.  She kept screaming, ""Why can't you just stop?!""  Well, if only it were that easy, huh?

I'm fucked.  I feel horrible.  I can't look her in the eyes.  I don't know what to do.  I'm so fucking lost.       ",1520321993.0

Mine would mostly be related on being treated humanely when taking an opiate, more specifically Suboxone. I realized that while i may be dependant on opiates, i am addicted because i am dependant, and i do not have the mindstate of an addict and do not want to classify myself as a drug addict or drug abuser. 


i hated AA and NA for their reasoning to reinforce their opinion of what they think that you should be and how you should act and operate your life. I disdain the government for forcing what we can and cannot put into our bodies . And a few more things that i wont get that deep into at the moment but i hope that you do.

Now, our feature presentation:


I told Cliff that I'm not buying dope this coming pay day and was met with no resistance. For some reason I expected him to try and convince me to commit to buying dope. I'll still pick up his script as previously promised and he's still going to give me two roxy 15mg's for my effort. + he's willing to trade me a 15mg roxy per a Suboxone strip. Of course, if I can only get the pills... we'll see if he's still interested.


Initially I told him I'd be happy getting nothing from him that day, but if he really needs subs then I'll get him four or five of them in exchange for four or five roxies. I certainly can't expect him to give me cash for subs so better off getting paid in whatever is readily available. If he don't want the subs I'm getting,then I won't accept the roxies he's offering me in trade.


&nbsp;

From there... I thought about buying a drone or telescope but then I had another brainstorm. The original bullshit reason I gave him for not being able to buy dope this week was to have money to pay for a $300 certification. Well, as it turns out.. that certification does indeed cost $300. Might as well get fucking certified. I've been meaning to do that for a while but I just kept postponing it in lieu of pot, and then pills and dope.


&nbsp;


The only thing Cliff said aside from general acknowledgment of my plan to get certified was ""It's gonna be a rough week from Thursday until the following Thursday."" Since I'm not planning to tap his supply of roxies and I'll even help him get some subs as long as he has something of equal value up front, I don't think it'll be a rough week for him.

If he does finish his subs and pills prematurely, it's not my problem. 

&nbsp;

**Funny fact, one which may rightfully get me lambasted:**


In the past when it's Cliff's pay day I've been paid in dope to make an ATM run with *his* card. I never took it upon myself to memorize his card number but of course I memorized his PIN to be able to withdraw money.


On two occasions that were months apart, I had to send Cliff to the ATM with my card on pay day to buy dope. He would take out an agreed upon amount and then I would come through on my lunch break to pick up my dope and partake in ripping a couple of bags.  As a result of those two occasions, **Cliff memorized my card number.** For a while this didn't cause any problems so I left it alone.


&nbsp;

On almost every one of my pay days in recent time however, as I wake up and drink my coffee while waiting for the direct deposit to roll in, Cliff would call the automated bank hotline to check the balance on my card. When the deposit rolled in, Cliff would call or text me to inform me of the amount. From there I would tell him how much dope I plan to buy and then I'd make my way to the ATM to get the cash.


It felt a little creepy that Cliff was checking my balance for me but it was convenient.

&nbsp;

THEN, on a couple of more recent occasions Cliff would ask me if he could order food on my card and would offer to pay me back in pills. When he still had pills during my pay day, this was not a problem. Of course if I said ""you can spend $30"" he'd spend $32. Then another time he said ""If I spend more than 30 this time, I'll give yo a fourth pill."" Well of course that time he spent $42 though I guess I can't be a stickler since my $4 breakfast sandwich was part of that order and he still gave me  a 4th pill, a $40 value after paying for his $38 in food.


**Nonetheless**, it creeps me out that he can and does check my card balance. Especially in the middle of a pay cycle. There was one time he ordered food and I didn't even know until two days later. I had to review my account history to pin-point it. When I texted him about it he said, ""yeah, you said it was okay."" Which I most certainly did not since it was $30 out of my last $50. He of course did pay me back in pills a week later but that doesn't replenish my cold hard cash for the preceding week. 

&nbsp;

More recently, I got a second debit card. Upon getting paid, I transfer a lion's share of my money to that card. So if Cliff asks me if he can order food, I can say no without being guilted for contributing to his mom's starvation.

A couple of weeks ago he caught a glimpse of my new debit card while I was racking up a line of dope and said ""do I need to memorize a new card number?"". Motherfucker, no! Well, that's what I said in my mind. Verbally, I told him it was an invalid prepaid card or some bullshit. Since then I've made sure not to let that card see the light of day in Cliff's house.

&nbsp;


Of course I can lock him out of my direct deposit card by changing the pin or eliminating that card but then if I need him to run to the ATM in the future on my behalf, he would get the chance to memorize my new card. So for just a little longer I'll pretend all is hunky-dory but obviously if I continue not to buy dope on pay day with Cliff as I am planning this week, that card will go the way of the Dodo. 

&nbsp;

In the mean time, I'll get paid, then I'll immediately transfer money to the card number he doesn't know so that when he checks my balance, he'll get the perception that I can't loan him any money for food because I'm broke. All the while the money that I plan to spend on tech certifications, a drone or a telescope will be safely stored on in an account that he cannot see or touch.

&nbsp;

 
#Phase 1
**Stop spending money on pay day to buy dope with Cliff.** If I was to spend money on dope this pay day and let Cliff middle for me, I'd have to buy dope for him and myself. So if I wanted two buns, I'd only get one bun for my own consumption. If I wanted Four buns, I'd have to buy five buns because there's a discount and then I'd still have to share half my order with him.

Sure, he'd pay me back for the part of the order that I got for him but he would not give me cold hard cash. He would likely give me some pills and some dope a week later. No, thank you.

&nbsp;

I'm excited about phase one. Now that I have that in the clear, I have one more option in addition to tech certification, a drone or a telescope. 


I can buy myself dope with my friend Tim (not to be mistaken with Tom). Tim will not scam or rob me. Furthermore, if I buy dope with Tim, I don't have to loan him half of whatever I buy. I could literally buy myself a small amount of dope and then still have money left over for a drone, a telescope or a certification. Whereas, if I bought dope with Cliff, I could not do any of these things.


Not the best idea, but I have it in the back of my head so that I **do not** get the temptation to buy dope with Cliff at all on pay day.",1520313403.0

Like when u actually manage to get some sleep? I went to USA on holiday to meet my parents who had come from Australia for my bday and stupidly didn't bring enough gear. My girlfriend got me Unisom which is an OTC sleeping pill. I took like a handful of them one night and had this crazy dream/s. First I was in like Afghanistan or something, trapsing thru the desert and came across this town where all the kids had no arms or legs, turned out there was no food and the adults were eating these kids arms and legs to sustain themselves. Still tried to score there, eventually got my hands on some dodgy looking shit then I woke up (typical). 

The next part of my dream, somehow I'd made it back to UK and I was with my middle at some council estate. Kano (the grime MC) was there doing heaps of meth and trying to hit me with a steel pipe for some reason. Anyway, again I eventually got on and tried to catch a cab from UK to USA before my parents noticed I was gone. I woke up really confused thinking I had stashed a wine glass that I was using to smoke gear beside the bed. It was really disorientating.

I really hate doctors. Especially my last two experiences.
Needless to say, i am prescribed Suboxone and have a very substantial stash of codeine

Phase 1 of my plan was to detox suboxone down to 1/16 of a 2mg tablet,
Then transition to very lose Codeine or Dihydrocodeine 
Until my pain levels out
At which point i would continue using Codeine and Dihydrocodeine for pain relief and Buprenorphine itself in a mega-low doseage (i.e. 0.2 mcg or 0.4 mcg )

and transitioning back and forth honestly in seek of effect of pain relief.

If i can get my Suboxone down to a low enough amount, quit, use a different opiate for pain,
Then if i absolutely need it, use Suboxone again, it would most likely obtain its pain killing effects rather than just other effects that do not manage my pain. most likely due to being on buprenorphine specifically for over 10 years straight


Thoughts?

I just wanted to update my situation for anyone who may have caught some of my desperate pleas for advice on here. Anyway, I‚Äôve been ‚Äútrying‚Äù to get clean for the past 5ish months, but I‚Äôve also been chipping here and there whenever I‚Äôve been able to get away with it. Well, that time has come to an end as I must begin Outpatient services at the beginning of next week. So, obviously I have been full on obsessed with having ‚Äúone last hurrah‚Äù with my frienemy, lady dope. Here‚Äôs where things get hella complicated...

I live an hour (approximately 50 miles) away from the nearest big city, which is where my 2 d-boys reside. (Yes, I only have 2. I‚Äôm a loser, I know. Ha ha ha.) It‚Äôs always been a pain in the ass, but I haven‚Äôt had access to a vehicle for several months. Thus, living in the country and working in a small city (which is still an hour away from the big city, and doesn‚Äôt have any public transportation to take you that far) has made copping damn near impossible. 

Now, over the past few months I‚Äôve had some ‚Äúluck‚Äù with either, paying a shit-ton of money for a taxi (which was $200 ONE WAY), randomly getting hooked up with the ONE Uber/Lyft in town (which is magical as it‚Äôs frequently nowhere to be found), borrowing a co-workers car (which I had to be stupid discrete about), and my d-boy actually let me send an Uber to bring him to me and take him back home a handful of times (which he has adamantly refused to do any longer.... I honestly don‚Äôt think he would do it if I offered him like $400 for one fucking bundle at this point... craziness, right?).

Anyway, all of these routes have been straight up dead ends for the past week that I‚Äôve been trying. Which makes total sense considering this was my last chance to use for quite awhile (hopefully forever, honestly), so why would things work out in my favor, ya know? After these all fell through, I actually tried several other different ways to get something, ANYTHING to work. I won‚Äôt go too far into details about those other plans though for certain, needed   reasons. LOL. Of course those were all dead ends too anyway. Of. Fucking. Course. 

But, FINALLY, today my junkie ass was smiled upon. I got out of work hella early, and there was an Uber 10 minutes from me willing to drive me into the city, and my d-boy was actually good and ready for me!!!  (The last time had a ride set up to take me to the smaller city I work in and then an Uber AND Lyft both magically driving around said town, my dude told me to come through but 15 minutes later said to ‚ÄúHold up, bro.‚Äù because he didn‚Äôt have any fucking dope and wasn‚Äôt gonna get more until later that evening, when I no longer had a ride into the smaller city!!!)

So. Ya‚Äôll. I finally got my ‚Äúone last hurrah‚Äù!!! (Of course as we‚Äôre walking around shady back alleys in a rather hot area of the city, my d-boy takes my money for a brick, hands me 3 bundles and says ‚ÄúI got 2 for ya the next time you come though.‚Äù What. The. Actual. Fuck. Whatever, it is what it is.)

Anyway, I‚Äôm currently happy and high and chillin‚Äô like a villain. I just wanted to say, THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who took time out to analyze my situation and give me a bunch of terrific advice and ideas. AND to those of you who simply sympathized with me and gave me many beautiful words of encouragement. There truly are a shit-ton of awesome, amazing, smart, sweet peeps in here. And I have SO much love for yinz wonderful people. 

Thanks again, ya‚Äôll! Stay safe out there. Much love to you guys!

Put down the opiates but drank at least a fifth a day til i was 27, when i began getting sober.  I got some real time and each relapse began getting shorter and shorter.  Finally got 18 months and had a job paying 600 a week before tax.  Thats not much but its something i never had and I was very proud and finally financially stable... two months ago they let me go.  For the first time in my life it wasnt my fault, they gave me a severance package and all those that mattered promised to be strong references... still hurt like hell though.

I applied lots and within a month got a second interview and I did splendidly.  They made a formal offer for more hourly than I have ever made, health insurance, 401k, and lots of room to grow. This was it, I finally had a chance at a career.  I waited to be scheduled for training, did the urinalysis, and fingerprinting.  The only thing on my background is an OWI 9 years ago and they knew about it.  They said it would not be an issue - misdemeanor, old, and no jail time.  Except there was... a little... jail time, that is.  I popped a roxy and failed a urine screen way back then, it wasnt even a habit to use on probation but all the same, I was caught.  I did seven days for that.

What I didnt know was that it mattered.  What i didnt know was that counted.  I was called today and thought I was going to get scheduled for training.  Instead they said my offer was no longer valid, the jobs gone.

For example, hydrocodone and oxycodone do *almost nothing* for me. I feel a little bit of a head rush, they work as actual painkillers and everything, but overall I wouldn't say I feel ""high"" or even euphoric. On top of that, they both cause horrible constipation for me, so I avoid them unless I need them for a medical reason.


I thought this was weird because from what I've heard online, these are both supposed to be great highs, yet I get almost nothing out of them.


On the other hand, I've had Codeine, just 30mg tabs, and I **loved it**. Super tingly, and euphoric, even just talking to other people gave me this wave of pleasure. In fact, I'd probably say Codeine would be my drug of choice, if I could get my hands on more.


Compared to hydros and oxy, it was night and day. Even a couple grams of Kratom gives me much more effects than ""stronger"" opioids. 


To be honest, I'd trade oxycodone or hydrocodone for Codeine or even Kratom any day of the week. Which isn't an opinion I've seen *anywhere* online. 


I still have yet to try Morphine, which I think I might like, because Codeine is mainly just a morphine prodrug, but I have trouble wrapping my mind around not liking oxy for example, because it's supposed to be stronger than morphine.


My question is, has anyone heard of/had similar experiences? Also, is there a biological reason I might not be receptive to certain opiates? Thanks :)

A suggestion....not exactly what you think!,"So after talking to someone about NA, etc. I thought of something, why not form our own group, called OA, based online? We basically follow the 12 steps, but we don't take that hardline approach that can scare addicts.


I guess the difference is, I think we as a community, could help each other out, those who want to stay clean, or those who just want to stay alive. This isn't a sobreity only group. 

This is a quality of life group. I want to improve our quality of life, individually. If you use opiates, we should help you with HR, not turn you away or chastise you. 

You'll quit when your ready, and when that time comes, we will be there, but we don't want to be pushy. The main rules of the sub will be followed, i.e. no sourcing etc, the crap that comes with operating a private chat.


I feel that NA can be a little harsh and scare others away. My intent, is this is a bridge, or so, to ease people who may not be comfortable with NA, to give it a shot.


Honestly, I thought NA was bullshit, but I gave it a shot this last month, and earnest shot. I don't really believe it all, and I still find crap in it I don't agree with, but I can't deny it. 


Something positive is happening in my life. Is this a good idea? I was thinking something alongs the line of a chatroom like r/trees has. Maybe this breaks a rule on here, but I looked and nothing suggests this.

Thoughts? Suggestions? Insults?


**TLDR: I want to make an all-inclusive group, of users and those who are clean or trying to get clean from opiates. Even if you have no urge to ever get clean, you can join. That's the premise. Yes kinda like this sub, but more....focused on taking active steps in HR**


 Because this group is about harm reduction and improving quality of life (and maybe segwaying into NA, but we don't want to push their doctrine). No coins/tags, no counting days, the only thing we care about is ""how is your day, are you okay, safe? If not lets talk about it, I think a lot of us have had really shit days, and can help someone else get through it.  

Like say you're having a problem shooting up correctly, this is a place you can come for advice with no judgement. And if you want to get clean, we should be there for each other too. I know people who are using, find hope sometimes when they hear others getting clean, and it may effect them down the road.

I just feel, NA is lacking something, whatever that thing was, it kept me away from attempting to reach out to people who were willing to help.


Any of the mods want to weigh in?


For some reason I feel there's a huge hole in my plan, and this is horrible lol, but I'd totally be down to learning how to run a chat and stuff. Maybe I just dun smoked too much weed today, and think everything is a good idea.

I took 4mg and 300mg tianeptine- I have the will to live and think I may come out the other end of this kick this time- I usually make it to About day 3-4 .

I am interested to know what your withdrawl symptoms are, some experience all and some experience unique and also just certian symptoms but harsher.

I have never ever been sick when in withdrawls, when most say that is the most common, my most common symptom in severe goosebumps and no appetite.
The sleep and wake in 1 hour soaked is horrific that is my worst symptom by a million miles.

Tonight I have managed to feel 70% better and eat a bag of Haribo, 1/4 cheesecake some McDonald's fries and some noodles.

Do you think I could awake tomorrow with no appetite again and restart the process? Or do you believe when a symptom improves it improves for the duration of the withdrawl?

I know I am waffling, I am just trying to understand the chemistry and the kindling effect of these withdrawls, it's such a unique and horrific experience, the worst flu you could get is alot better than this, due to the none mental aspect that lingers.

I have been snorting .5mg or suboxone every few hours to take the edge and this is day 3 of my detox.

I have 3mg of suboxone left now, do i even need to 're dose to try sleep if I am not in need? Or should I save it for tomorrow, or maybe just use like .25 mg before bed now?

I'm u.k hence why I'm going to bed now lol!!

(communicate my intent not to buy dope with Cliff on pay day),"#Note: Scroll down to the long horizontal line and bold text that says ""Start here"" if you don't want to read a whole bunch of background info to build up to the point of this post.

&nbsp;

Last two times I was at Cliff's house were a couple of days ago. The first was to watch SVU and Waco and that did generate my previous and most recent Cliffpost. Secondly was to help him buy subs. For once he actually wanted to buy subs in a timely manner but his sub connects suck or barely exist so of course I was requested to accomplish this mission through my contacts.


&nbsp;

My contact was originally going to come to me but due to rain and hunger they opted to go to the local fast food joint. It was pouring rain outside so the connect offered me one extra sub for biking over. Cliff paid for four subs and agreed to give me one. Of course I didn't tell him about the fifth free sub so I pocketed that as well. All-in-all, I did pretty well for myself.

&nbsp;

That night stuck around after delivery I stuck around Cliff's for all of thirty minutes. During that time we glossed over a couple of topics. For one, he shared a story about his attempted trade/transaction with our neighbors. One of them being the hardcore benzo enthusiast who wanted to trade three blues for many xannies. Cliff didn't want to trade, he proffered cash to buy a bundle of dope. The benzo enthusiast wanted $25 when he paid $20 and he felt that he deserved to make a little money off of each. With Cliff, he wanted two for $5 on the benzos when fair market value could easily reel in more cash per pill. 


Moff, the benzo enthusiast argued that Cliff didn't pay a lot for the benzos so he shouldn't charge as much. Okay fair enough, Moff always wants top dollar for shit but always wants to low ball. Just about every selfish actor in trade.

&nbsp;

Tom, not to be mistaken with Tim lives nearby as well and is often the middleman for Cliff. Tom is the one who ratted me out indirectly for doing dope. The true details are murky and will never be fully known but when I was told that my brother was coming over to ""talk about something very important"" on a particular Saturday, I had a hunch what it was about. Once I had a hunch on what it was about, it wasn't very hard to guess the source of the leak.


Months later, Tom apologized to me for being the source of the leak. He said, ""I was talking to my mom and my brother must've overheard...""


WTF, why the fuck does he think it's cool to talk about my dope habit and my need to purchase suboxone before a trip with his mom. He probably told his brother directly, but if he did only tell his mom.. she has a big mouth as well so I'm lucky the info didn't spread with more virility. In conclusion, I believe Tom spoke about my activities in order to soften the negative impact of his mother knowing about his own activity. ""Look, Sloany does this shit too and he's a bright fella."" After the fact I told this mofo, like WTF... I don't tell my family that you do dope and smoke crack. As far as they're concerned you're a professional in whatever you do. Well, in reality I used to say that. I stopped covering and started slandering his good name in front of my immediate family after the information leak as part of my damage control.


&nbsp;

After the info leak, my brother came over to have the talk and stage the intervention. The first question aside from how I was doing, of course it was the master inquiry. Am I doing dope? Where the fuck did you hear that from? Around the neighborhood you say? 


I love when someone rats you out or accuses you of something and nobody will tell you who. Like when I was kid in school and someone ratted me out for throwing food across the cafeteria or some other shit. Later on in life when I hear the saying, ""you have the right to face your accuser"", I think back to all the times I could've quoted that phrase when I was kid. Of course, the schools are like mini dictatorships. As for family interaction, I don't know why I can't be told who the fuck the source of the information leak is. Perhaps this is to make it more challenging for me to cover my tracks? It's not like I'm going to go beat the shit out of a friend who contacted my brother out of concern for my well being. 


&nbsp;


So anyway, a few months ago we have this talk in the family room due to an information leak. Aside from asking whether I was doing dope, my sibling also said, ""I was told that you tried to sneak Suboxone on to an airplane."" I truthfully stated, I did not *try* to sneak Suboxone on to a plane. I also attested to the fact that I went through a full body scan and physical frisking. Since I had a hunch of who made the information leak, I made up a story about a weed transaction gone awry and spoke about how Tom is in fact a crackhead. Crack is the worst (exaggeration) and people who do crack and heroin are even worse. **Would you trust the word of a crackhead-heroin addict?** Apologies to anybody who likes Crack and Dope who is reading, but this did prove effective as a means to draw suspicion away from myself.


In the end of that discussion, my brother was sufficiently satisfied as was my father after a urine test. Yes, many of us know that urine tests can be thrown and this proved effective in this instance.


&nbsp;
________________________________________________

#Start here if you don't care for the background info:

**During that intervention, before I sufficiently convinced the inquisition that I was not consuming dope, my brother stated, ""so, there is a detox period."" To which I responding, ""which is entirely unnecessary since I have nothing to detox from!""**


Fast forward to two days ago, I'm sitting at Cliff's kitchen table as he's prepping himself a line. I took a portion of a sub that day as I did for the days prior, the topic of cessation came up. I referenced the time I had that mini-intervention and how my brother referenced the ""detox period."" Cliff made light of addiction by saying that I needed detox as much as he didn't need Jenny Craig (he's a fat bastard). He argued that I by no means needed to detox, supposing that I wouldn't go through too much Withdrawal, if any whenever I stopped using dope.

&nbsp;

I felt like I was being told the sky is not blue. I know that I can at least experience withdrawal symptoms that last a solid three days. After the worst of it things smooth out but it still isn't the easiest week. This is why it's easy for someone to be drawn back to using dope once they have the means to get dope after seven days of nothing. If I wasn't addicted, I wouldn't be going out of my way to get Suboxone before getting dope-sick. 


It's like he sees the writing on the wall, that I'm not super committed to spending a bunch of money on dope this coming pay day. I've hinted many ways by indicating that there is no certainty that I'll buy dope this coming pay day. I still told him regardless of what I do, I'll still pick up his roxy script this week if time permits.",1520283089.0

I do know that I definitely felt uncomfortable from this shot. I‚Äôm pretty sure it was too much dope. I usually do the same amount. That was the last rig in the bag I had too. It‚Äôs been 4 days with shooting/dabbing. So it‚Äôs not like it was my first shot I‚Äôve had in months or anything like that. It‚Äôs not different dope. I also didn‚Äôt use very much water it was pretty thick and dark. Idk doesn‚Äôt matter really.....all that matters is I‚Äôm okay and didn‚Äôt have any mishaps. I didn‚Äôt like feeling so uncomfortable like that. 

Also, might as well mention this because I‚Äôve been wanting to ask this just haven‚Äôt made a post yet......

I can‚Äôt for the life of me IV anywhere else but the crooks of my arms. I‚Äôve tried in tons of places and can‚Äôt register. I don‚Äôt IV a lot so it‚Äôs not a huge issue for me but I don‚Äôt like only shooting in the crooks of my arms for the couple of days I do IV. The past few days of IV and both crooks have bruises on them. I‚Äôve even gone as far as trying to hit my neck before and thank god I couldn‚Äôt register. 

I guess I‚Äôm just a noob lol only reason for this post really was because of the uncomfortable itchy sensation I got right after the shot. I try not to post things that have been asked a million times but I couldn‚Äôt really find any post mentioning a word of this ",1520409522.0

I‚Äôve been in and out of detoxes the past 3 months, as an truly honest attempt to finally get clean.

Just a heads up; if you‚Äôre on fent, apparently the fent test is much more expensive and a lot of rehabs don‚Äôt carry it, so you WILL come up negative for opiates. Also good to know for people taking regular 5 panel drug tests, if you‚Äôre just using fent it comes up clean. Happy nods",1520403855.0

If so how does it interact with opiates? Does it diminish the high? Does it make the SSRI not work? 

I'm currently on Paxil and this is my 14th day taking it. I'm still feeling opiates just as well and I'm not noticing any negative reactions. I am having some side effects but their not severe and it's nothing I cannot handle. Erectile dysfunction, a strange energy, nausea, and some diahrrea to name a few. It's hard to say what's from opiate WD and what's from the Paxil though. When I'm on opiates I don't notice the Paxil at all.

Do you guys think that doing opiates 4 to 5 days a week will cause the Paxil not to be effective? I know it takes six weeks to work fully so I guess I will find out. I still don't know how feel about SSRIs but I'll know soon. I often feel that it's all bs and mostly placebo but millions of Americans are on them, and many feel it helps so it's hard to argue with statistics like that.

Thanks for the replies everyone. I'll give an update in a couple weeks and let people know if I feel it's helping or what. Just for the people that care or are thinking about getting on an antidepressant. My pupils were also huge the first few days on it but since then it is not as apparent, especially on opiates. Time will tell how thing's will work though I suppose. I'm making the switch to Kratom at the end of the week so I feel that will help things as well.",1520398686.0

I know that potency is notoriously variable and I plan to start low and work my way up, but I don't even know how much I need to get to begin with. Should 50mg be enough? 200mg?

Why Heroin is cheaper than Morphine? Details in post,"So I‚Äôm wondering why is Heroin much cheaper than Morphine and why is Morphine harder to find than Heroin?

Isn‚Äôt is harder to make Heroin? Extra steps in the creation process? Also doesn‚Äôt it then yield less Heroin in weight than Morphine would? 

Now let‚Äôs assume that they both are just as easy to make or that the cooking process is trivial. Why isn‚Äôt Morphine created and distributed as much as Heroin is on the streets/black market? Like, I‚Äôm POSITIVELY POSITIVE that people/junkies would have just as much of a want for Morphine as is with Heroin. Also on the legal side, Morphine is less of a charge than Heroin considering their scheduling.

Hi Guys, Its time for my old ass to kick this shit again. Tolerance is gone to high to get stoned without shooting. I haven't shot since 2004 and really want to avoid that. Just for me when I shoot, I turn into a shooting machine and my ""barely keeping my head out of the water"" functioning completely falls apart.

Anyway I have done a lot of detox over the last 25 years both residential and at home. I know what works and what I need. I am only back on since early December and currently have cut back to 0.75g a day which keeps me ok and mildly stoned. Not a hope of a nod but still a nice hit.

http:  My only question is around Pregablin/lyrica. Im currently gathering the benzo/tablet stock I need. I picked up 30 150mg lyrica caps. I have no experience at all with it but hear its great for wds. I would appreciate any experiences, advice or dosage around the lyrica for wds.

 I don't know what I am trying to say other than I hope I find something that can make me as giddy and happy as I am with my friends when copping. Nothing is better than when your all excited on the way to score with your running mate. Reminiscing about it with them on the phone and giggling like a kid. I love the adrenaline rush of picking up and the paranoia that you might get booked. 
What can compare in the real world? Sober life just seems dull to the crazy world of using. I love it and I hate it.  I plan on staying clean for a little bit after this bump but it is kind of sad that it made me realize how much I miss certain things about it and forgot how fun being bad can be.

I started using at 15 and started the needle at 23. At 31 I got clean for a yr...yr and a half but I'm back to the grind sadly. 
Let me start with...I'm not a newb to the lifestyle, and I'm educated. I have my nursing license which luckily I haven't lost yet but that's probably cause I'm not working at the moment lol. 
Here's my question...
At 23 I started using morphine and the needle. I did that for several years. I was married to a man that had a great job, LOTS of $$, and was always gone :-/ so it was easy to hide my doings. (He eventually found my shit when I was 31 and quickly divorced me. I can't blame him. No hate there.) But anyway, I always used legit morphine. I had always been scared to death of H. All the stories of ppl dying and stuff. Plus, money wasnt a prob so I stuck with the M's. 
About 6 months ago a guy I use every once in awhile when my normal connects are dry, started dealing the H. And he gave me a lil piece of foil with some in it to try. I took it home and hid it. Stayed there for a week and then money got tight and I got sick and I thought....what the hell? Right? 
Cook it and bang.....and.....nothing. My cousin told me what he gave us each what one good dose. Yet....nothing. I sat disappointed, and wondering 'ppl actually prefer this over morphine?' 
You see....I have friends that prefer the H. And they have always said 'its heaven' 'you think morphine from the pharmacy is great, try this...' Blah blah blah. So I was just expecting so much more than the nothing I got. 
Also, I'm alil different from my friends. They do H or morphine and they are nodding and giddy and shit. But when I do morphine I'm energized, and have this amazing euphoria, and feel ready to conquer the world which usually just means an in depth cleaning of my house. 
So....are there any of y'all that get energized by morphine? Like...I dont 'nod' or whatever, I smash 120 mg in my veins and I'm the energizer bunny! So any of y'all like that? And if y'all are....is H the same for y'all? I had a friend say that even if morphine wired me up H wouldnt. In yalls experience is that true? Because I just don't like that feeling. I dont want to ""nod"" my high away. I want to get high and get shit done lol. 
Sorry for the long post. I'm just curious. Because the nurse in me says: H is just man-made morphine outside of a factory so it should do the same thing. Yet I have ppl telling me that if morphine gives me energy H still won't? ",1520527039.0

Is this rock bottom I ask myself? I try to shake those thoughts and praying he comes soon so I can feel numb and forget about the hours of agony I already endured this morning. 

I finally score and I go to a lot near a medical building like I routinely do. Dump about a .7 of that mexican dog food on a spoon filling the needle with liquid as black as my heart has become. I am no longer human, I live for the rush. Nothing comes before it, personal, work, or family. How did I get to this point? How did it get this out of hand? I am not sure but each and every time I do it I forget about all my worries and all of sudden the day is beautiful again. ",1520521971.0

Living situation compromised twice over. Car has been reported stolen though I pay for it, getting new plates, VIN numbers and paperwork today. Doctor still says no job, so still selling meth, may have found a couple under the table jobs that are legitimate, either way financial stability/income security still compromised. Clean time still 100%. Saturday will be 17 weeks I think. I saw my dad a few hours ago, when we do actually sit down in person it's a shit show, but every once in awhile we have these conversations that show me just how brilliant my father actually is. One of the smartest men I've known, it's unfortanute we but-heads so much. Our conversation from a few hours ago was not one of the brilliant ones. He pulled a pistol on me and shoved me into a wall, but I love him no less than I did before. 

I don't know what this post is for.

Why does it seem like the faster you need to get there, the more narrow the path becomes? Got me all kinds of fucked up.

anyways i've been clean a little over 6 months now, and the first 3-4 months i was drinking a lot, and i never ever got hangovers before in my life and i went through like a 2 year phase of drinking socially, but very heavily 4-5 times a week. anyways after those 3-4 months i quit drinking for about a month because i realised i was starting to get hangovers, anyways this last month i started drinking again and it's been REALLY fucking me up. like the first time i drank, i had 2 mikes harder drinks, the cranberry ones and i was puking for like 4 hours, bile and all. so i stopped again and about 2-3 weeks ago i had TWO beers and i was just way drunker than i should have been, and the next day i was throwing up/shitting my brains out and felt like i couldn't move i was so weak. i called it a fluke but it happened 2 more times so i quit drinking again.

my only thought is this must be my liver somehow, i pray to god its not cause i'm only 25 and i just can't deal with that shit right now. 

been doing drugs since i was 12-13 and i feel like it caught up with me WAY sooner than i had ever expected.

Tunrs out, the certification test I lied about, is totally affordable and even after buying dope for myself, since I only spent half of what I normally would I have more than enough money to pay for the certification, buy subs, bike parts and other random non-drug related stuff. I could buy a drone but then I would have just barely enough money for the certification so I'll wait a bit longer. It's better to rack up whatever certifications I can ace tests for because once I have a higher paying job I can buy a drone.


Two weeks from now on pay day I'll tell Cliff that I can't buy dope with him again because I decided to get clean and am getting more certifications which wont be far from the truth. Whether I'll get clean or not for real.. I'm not sure but I think reducing the stress associated with constantly spending double to help Cliff borrow dope will make it easier for me to kick. By not letting him manage my funds on my behalf, and by not spending money that I don't want to spend, life will be better.


&nbsp;

Aside from certifications and low stress dope purchases, I also look forward to:



A) Getting a drink with a couple of normie friends.



B) Going out with my wingman. I don't know exactly waht it is, but I have a friend who I used to work with and whenver I am with him and his female friends or female friends of his friends are out..... at least one of them takes a liking to me. Yes, I know I have it in me but I've never had a friend who has been as effective of a wingman as thsi friend. I haven't been able to leverage this friendship because of my escalating dope habit. If I say to Cliff ""I have $800 but I want to ekep the order small so I can advance my dating and flining ops"", he'll try to convince or trick me into fucking that up. 



C) Starships. I was thinking about siging up for that thing where they mail you two Star Trek ships a month.



D) More data storage, more anime, parts for shit...



E) My bike deserves ugrades. Not just the upgrades eiher, basic maintenace like my chain is long overdue. It's working well but I really should get a new chain before it gets worn down more.



F) üê¢  My beloved turtles. üê¢ They deserve so much better.üê¢  This week I will go to the hardware store and buyt the remainder of the pieces required to allow the two brats to cohabitate a very large tank safely. Basically, üê¢  they need a divider | üê¢ | üê¢ | in the big tank so that they don't fight and bite. Beyond that, I need to buy a $50 light bulb.üê¢ 

&nbsp;

So yeah, the afformentioned list is of things th at haven't been getting my attention partially because I can **never** get cash back when I buy dope with Cliff and share/loan him half of the order. This was unsustainable in the begining and I should've stopped it when it started. If I wasn't kicking I should've found my own dope connect. Though, I think having my own connect for subs is way more important and am glad I took care of that first.


Beyond that, it'll be way easier for me to kick if I don't have to worry about Cliff's reaction when I suddenly say ""I'm not buying"" because it'll no longer be *sudden*. 


&nbsp;

Established pattern: If it's my pay day and Cliff is broke til next week, when I buy dope he's my only connect to connects. So he's like my double middle. I get the money after direct deposit occurs, tell him what to order and he handles it.


From there, let's say I paid for five bundles. Typically we split the order in half. Cliff pays me back within a week. When he does pay me back, he never gives me cash. Lately he's consistely paid me back with 15 mg oxy's from his script. In the past he has paid me back on his pay day in dope, other times both.

&nbsp;

Sometimes we end up even and then on rare occasions he gets paid before I do and he ends up buying dope for the two of us. Like weeks ago he got eight buns/bundles. I got four buns out of that. Other times he ordered 5 buns and I got two out of it. Same for him. At an earlier point in time I thought it was going to be consistently disproprtionate but we sometimes take turns being disproportiate so that's cool.


&nbsp;

What's not cool is when I pay double to get half the order for myself. The other half, he pays me back for but enver in cash. If I need cash, like this one time weeks ago he said ""I'll sell a couple of pills to my sister for you."" Days later it didn't happen, or more accurately he did sell a couple of pills to his sister but used it for himself. Then ended u pgiving me two extra pills weeks later because by then I didn't need the cash anymore and I didnt' want to wait an eternity to get the fucking cash.

&nbsp;



I wanted to break the cycle so that I'd be in a better position to get clean when I choose to. Before getting clean, I really wanted to experience buying dope without having to share half the order as a loan.


So I mad arrangements with my old pal Tim. I was willing to bike 10 miles to see him if he took the day off from work due to snow, luckily he did not so I met him on the way to work. It was perfect. No middleman fee at all. Like I got everything I paid for.

&nbsp;


The money I didn't spend buying loaner dope for Cliff, will now go towards a certification test that I need and want. Alternatively, if I fail the practice test I Can buy a drone this week and wait until the next pay cycle to do the certification. **I'll probably ace the practice test and pay for the certification test registration this week.** Next week Cliff gets paid, maybe he'll offer to loan me dope to be owed. At that time I must be strong and resist because I don't want to share or loan dope money to Cliff two weeks from now.



I shouldn't buy dope two weeks from now, I should on track for getting clean but if I buy dope it needs to be like it was today. No bullshit. I pay for what's mine and i get what's mine. The cash that's nto spend on me is cash that I still have for spending whatever I need or want in life.

&nbsp;

No more of this taking turns buying dope bullshit. If anything, I'll help him procure subs at best but of course as I've done since late November, if he doesn't pony up anything for the subs, he aint getting subs. When I get a lot of subs, I never tell him how many I really have so he can't get complacent and say ""I don't need subs, sloan will just give me some if I beg or offer to trade something.""


Speaking of, this week when I pretneded not to buy dope as far as Cliff know... I certainly didn't get it through him and his middle.... he wants subs so he offered to trade me 5 roxies at 15mg each, which is not a great value of a trade.

&nbsp;


Coincidentally, when Tim heard that I was getting paid in roxies for waking up early to pick up Cliff's script today, he wanted some. Tim has subs but he like roxies more. So he offered to trade whatever I could spare. So we agreed, 5 15s for 5 sub strips. Now when I bring subs to Cliff, he'll offer to pay me in roxies so it loosk like both Tim and I are are seperately takig a minor hit costwise. 


In conclusion, it's nice not having to share and loan out half of my total dope order.",1520509411.0

I did time for **** a few years ago, we've had a weird relationship.

He moves in and supplies he weed whilst I'm counting down the time till he goes to sleep so I can smoke.  As we sit and while the night away smoking bud from across Europe, a red bag sits next to him.

This bag contains around d 2 kilogram of weed and at least 3k  cash.


If I were a better man, I wouldn't be thinking of stealing his bag right now. But I am.
He's been tormenting and I've dug myself into a hole. His bag could cover my ass and get me.a new start somewhere.


So far the plan is to discreetly make up a bug out bag and wait till he leaves the house.  Then I'll steal the bag, try to sell the weed and fly away.   Simple eh.

I'm currently shaking on the toilet trying to squeezes something out whilst he's asleep with 2 dogs, a rolex and a bag.

I joined the US Navy in 2008 and in 2011  injured my back. My doctor prescribed me 120mg Percocet/day and I was on it for a few months until I was discharged. 
So I'm back in the civilian world and my doctor would not prescribe me more than the 5/300mg percocets. 
So I'm back in school, but can't focus cuz I'm wding, so I find a local connect who hooks me up with 30s for $25per. It started out somewhat tame, but is still at least a 50$/day habit. So I have to come up with a way to make money while going to school... so I start selling a little bit of pot to my friends. Initially eighths, quarters, halves. But as my network grows, so does the volume of pot I move. With the money I'm making, I'm able to buy more and more 30s and I built up quit a tolerance to the point where I was smoking 20-25 blues a day. At that time, I had started selling ounces/qps of coke and I wouldn't sell pot unless it was at least a couple pounds sale. (I would pay drivers 5-10k to drive from CO/WA/CA to CT. They would make deliveries along the way, in Chicago and philly but the bulk of it would come to me for distribution). 
Come 2014, one of my 'friends' says that he's got a local client who wants 10lbs (at this point, I was selling all over New England and as far south as Georgia). This wasn't out of the ordinary, but this client wanted to meet in a mall parking lot. I didn't think anything of it, and went to meet him with the 10lbs. I pull up next to his flashy red Mercedes, take the bags out of my trunk, put it in his, and as I'm doing that, like 6 cars swarm in from everywhere. They box in my car and agents jump out, guns drawn, yelling ""get on the ground"". 
So I got arrested with 10lbs and $40k cash on me and charged with trafficking by the DEA. They seized 2 of my cars, 2 boats, and my apartment. All I had left was 30k cash and a $500/day percocet habit. I made the switch over to heroine, but was still smoking 6 bundles a day and eventually spent all my money. Started doing the grimey junkie shit to my family and friends. Became suicidal, got arrested for simple possession a few times. My family and friends  disowned me. I Tried a few rehabs that put me on subs, but dope had its hooks in me and I kept relapsing... 
about a year ago I entered into a new rehab. Went to this place 3 hours a day 5 days a week, they put me on the vivitrol shot (which works great!), I started doin yoga, and goin back to church/bible study/school/NA/other social activities. 
Tomorrow I'll be 7 months clean. I'm back in school, broke AF, and I'm 30 and living with my parents. I miss the chaos of addiction and the constant rippin and runnin and the adrenaline rush of wheelin and dealin, but I miss it less and less each day. 
Yeah, being sober sucks, but it's better than chasing that unattainable high. I can confidently say that, for today, opiate addiction does not have its hooks in me. 

Point of the story: if I can do it, so can you!

I was on Methadone for about a year and a half and when it came time to get off it I had to spend 2 weeks in a medicated detox unit and a further month at home feeling like death, shitting the bed once a week and getting no sleep.

Since then I've managed to kick maybe a dozen times completely painlessly and without getting back on the old liquid handcuffs, all thanks to lyrica.

When it comes time to get off the gear I leave it as long as possible after my last shot until I start to feel the rattle (though you don't have to if you'd rather have a totally painless transition) and take 300/450mg of Pregab, then again at 6 hour intervals and a benzo or zopiclone to sleep.

About 5-7 days of this is usually enough to get past the worst of it, after that it's the psychological withdrawal and depression you need to fight through but the rattle is mostly over.

When you're on the pregab you honestly don't feel any of the effects of the rattle. The weird speedy feeling you get can be annoying but it's absolutely liveable and worth putting up with since it also keeps you completely functional and WD symptom free.

I don't know how easy it is to get hold of (I got lucky and have a relative who has a running prescription he doesn't use) but I am sure it is available on the darknet markets.",1520477992.0

He‚Äôs also the only person that I know can get them.  

Well long story short I‚Äôve been bugging him for a few weeks about finding H in our smallish Southern town an he‚Äôs found it. Tonight I‚Äôm chilling in bed and it‚Äôs been a few days since talking to S and he out of no where hits me up.

Low and be hold it was the latter, he had OD. He apparently ran into his old super awesome plug that he‚Äôs been talking about for awhile and he couldn‚Äôt get his number. 

Well the dude usually has pandas and H and S being a bro bought a G of H because he knew I wanted some. Well he was with his friend after scoring and he decided to sniff some on our local coastal highway and he told that he remembered the come up then waking up at a gas station  on the ground with medics and police. From his friend he knows this, after sniffing he was acting weird, nodding out but holding small conversations while nodded. He noticed S was acting different then how he usually acts on H, pulled into the gas station and told S he was getting him a water, when the guy returned S was slumped and blue in the face so he dragged him out and laid him out on the ground and called the cops. The guy remembered S‚Äôs stash and took it out of his pocket before LE arrived, S doesn‚Äôt know what happened to the H nor does he care, S told me he only sniffed about .1 no more then .2, but he didn‚Äôt think it was even a .1. 

It was his first OD and the medics saved him with narcan. When he called he sounded scared and he told me he doesn‚Äôt want to touch it again and he wants to stick to opana. He has a high tolerance, and he was suspecting it was fent. He talked to the dealer and they are decent friends, he said the dealer was shocked and didn‚Äôt believe it and that he thought S sniffed atleast over .5 at once until S told him it was .1.

I‚Äôve been using for about a year now and I didn‚Äôt start because I wanted to get high. I have chronic daily migraines and have had them since I was very young. After years of Drs visits, scans, medications, operations, injections, whatever you could think of, we hadn‚Äôt found a solution. That was until one day it got so bad I had to go to the emergency room. They tried giving me all of the typical meds to no avail, until they came to the dilaudid injection, which worked wonders. That day, for the first time in years I had absolutely 0 pain from my headaches.

I went to my neurologist with this information and they refused to prescribe any type of opiate because I‚Äôm too young. We went back to the trial and error of the different meds for about 2 years getting no relief along the way. In those 2 years, I had to go back to the emergency room about 4 times, given the same solution. Also in these 2 years I had lost 5 jobs, all in different fields/lines of work, because I was unable to work with my medical issue.

Because I can‚Äôt work with my condition the obvious solution is disability. There‚Äôs problems here. 1) The medical community has a very hard time declaring someone under the age of 25 as medically disabled, and 2) A migraine isn‚Äôt like back problems, there isn‚Äôt an X-ray you can get to tell you, yes, this person is plagued with daily migraines. This is why I started using heroin (well, I started taking pills and when I could no longer afford that, heroin)

Since I started using, I have held a job for 6 months, the longest I ever have, and I‚Äôm able to function in day to day life. I still have a migraine every single day, but the H consistently either takes the pain away, or brings it to a level that I can tolerate and still be a functioning member of society. But as we all know, when using opiates long term your tolerance builds. My life is at a point where after I buy my ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù, take care of gas and bills, I‚Äôm broke, and even then, some months I struggle to keep my heroin supply stocked enough to make it through life. 

I‚Äôve never injected, and told myself I never would, but right now it seems the only option I have to still be able to function, work my job, and live a normal life without being broke all the time is to switch to IV. I‚Äôm torn. I know with how bad my condition is I should be able to either get the meds I need for my pain, or be declared disabled because I cannot work any normal job with these migraines (fluorescent lights, computer screens, loud noises, etc, make the pain worse to the point of vomitting, sometimes I even pass out) but due to the condition I have and my age, it just won‚Äôt happen, no matter how much I‚Äôve been trying. 

I guess I don‚Äôt really have any type of question here, as I know everyone will say that even though it will make my habit cheaper, switching to IV is a bad idea, I just needed somewhere to puke out all of my feelings to some people who understand.

Can get real dilaudid 8mg (thank god again).

After joining this sub I've been seeing a lot of pressed pills and I'm curious as to what they press them with and how to test them.

I'll make this as short and simple as possible 

when I was 11 years old my brother got arrested for selling weed, LSD, and cocaine. and I mean heafty amounts. at the time nobody in my family would tell me what was going on because I was so young so I was just told to write him letters once a week and we'd go visit him every so often. this was my brothers first offense and he ended up in a program called shock (I'm from the United States) where's it's basically a crazy boot camp where they whip you into shape and a ton of officers are in charge of it. let me tell you, seeing someone you love being treated like they're not a human because they're a criminal is something will stick in your head ever when you're 11 years old. I can still see the room and the officers screaming at them and the shame in his eyes for doing this to his family he felt horrible. and just the way life goes a couple months after getting out he ended up getting a dwi and getting sent back again.  this of course gave me a great intro as to you know ""drugs are bad kids stay in school"" 

flash forward to about age 13 where I had surrounded myself with kids that were 18+ and almost all drug addicts and/or alcoholics. as the years went on they rubbed off on me and I soon got into coccain, oxys, hydros, acid, molly, shrooms etc. 

flash forward again to age 16 where I was steadily doing like 60mg of oxy(I was 105lb 16y/o female at the time so 60 is kinda a lot) almost every day for something like 6 months. now comes the good part. still 16, still doing drugs, I got my first job with a friend let's call him Dale. Dale got me an interview and I got a job and I had a really good time working there. it had been about 3 months working there and I was dating this kid, let's call him Joe. Joe's dad is a paramedic and I was sleeping over at his house one night. that morning I woke up and my friends had told me Joe's dad was on a call last night for Dale and that had overdosed on heroin( which I found out later that day was sold to him by a co-worker that I proceeded to tell my managers about and she got fired) I called a friend and they told me it was true. I cried all day I was hysterical. I was supposed to go into work but I called in then had to proceed to drive there anyway and explain to my managers what had happened to Dale. I can still see my coworker faces when I told them that he had died. giving people news like that is horrible everyone's hearts sank. he was the nicest sweetest kid ever, always had a smile on his face, always nice to everyone no matter what. and he was gone. and I was the one who had to tell everyone. 

later that night my friend was having her birthday party and I was still a mess. I ended up taking 12 shots(again I was a tiny little girl) and taking an ectasy pill kinda hoping I wouldn't wake up the next morning. my plan failed and I ended up just throwing up on the birthday girl and having her put me to bed. (this part was not necessary at all but kinda funny)

flash forward ONE MORE TIME to about a year into my relationship with Joe. at this point my view on drugs was very fucked up it had seriously fucked me up mentally what drugs had managed to do to all the people I loved I mean at age 16 I knew more kids who had been to jail or rehab or died or whatever is it than most adults do. so anyway. Joe ends up addicted to shooting heroin. I'm not sure where to go with this story considering I'm getting pretty close to present day so all I can really say to wrap this up is drugs and heroin have really fucked up my life and I haven't even directly been the user. it hurts me to see all these people I love end up like this and feeling like I can't do anything about it. like I should have seen the signs I should have known. I know enough about drugs to know that I should have seen it. I should have noticed him at work I should have seen his track marks I should have put the pieces together and done SOMETHING. and now he's gone. and Joe is recovering and on subs right now but heroin addiction is crazy it could take over again as soon as he gets some who knows? 

this story really has no point to it at all but a bunch of people said they read this shit for fun so there ya go. I tried to be quick. thanks for reading 

PS somewhere in there I fucked up the math I'm not still 16 Incase anyone was wondering.... I'm 19 almost 20",1520457359.0

Why is it ok to rx me suboxone which is a terrible drug that is even stronger than the opiates I want and makes me feel like shit, messes with my hormones and god knows what else? What the fuck is the difference ? Opiates have no long term negative effects on your body. Alcohol does. But that‚Äôs ok for people to partake in.   I know tolerance goes up but who cares? Then rx me more ! Just like you did with ever other medication I‚Äôve been prescribed in the past. Why is giving me a pill for depression, a pill for anxiety , a pill to wake up and a pill to go to sleep better than one pill that solves all of these issues?

I love opiates  and I should be able to take them forever without the negative consequences I face everyday .Before oxy and h I was depressed, had no motivation, and was going through the motions of life. I had no past trauma,had  a great childhood , graduated college, but always felt like I needed more to feel fulfilled and happy .

So tell me how is that bad?   It‚Äôs when I couldn‚Äôt get the opiates I turned into a worse person than I ever was.

Someone who is forced to be compulsive . I drive faster and harder. I‚Äôm always in a rush . I risk getting arrested everyday of my life .

In the building you can use whatever drugs however you want be it injection, snorting, smoke, or even oral use (I think). Oh except for plugging. No butt stuff allowed. 

I went there yesterday as I had some hydromorphone already loaded in a rig and was too sketch to shoot in public like a washroom. I realized that the safe injection site was just a few blocks away so I figured might as well go there instead of trying to shoot in an alley or public bathroom.

I go to the site, introduce myself and basically said why I was there and what I was using. They read me their terms and conditions ect, and after signing a paper one of the workers there brought me into the room for iv use. There was 8 or so booths no one was in there except for another one of the workers. The guy in the injection room gave me a little tray with everything I needed, fresh rig, water, cooker, alcohol wipes and even a Band-Aid too. At this time I was starting to really feel my wd kick in so I decided to add more hydro to the premade shot I made that morning.

So mix, filter, bang, and then sweet oh so sweet relief. Talked to the one of the workers there for a couple minutes then said I had to go cause I was in a bit of a hurry at the time. Went back out to the front desk and they told me they're giving out $5 gift cards for everyone's first time coming to the place.

I never had an accident and was always a good driver. Either way, that is neither here nor there.

I picked up a passenger and it was a slow day so he was the only person on a 15 passenger vehicle. I wouldn't do this normally but the only connect I had was about 2, 2/12 hours away and my work required me to go to the city so sometimes I would try to meet a connect while going to the city from the mountains.

I needed to drop the person off near the airport but I ended up taking a 20 minute de tour in the city saying that we had to pick someone up before I dropped them off because it was the only way I was gonna be able to pick up. He was probably around 16 or so, I feel ashamed so don't tell me what a scumbag I was or possibly still am. 

Either way as I arrived to our ""destination"" I told him to hold on for one second as I try to reach the passenger as he is not answering the phone. I walk around the corner from where we are, score, get right back on the bus and make it in time for his drop with no suspicion all while putting my job on the line. I was pleased with myself at the time but looking back at it I regret it.

Also hoping for some type of abusable long-acting. 

What are some things I DON'T want if she mentions it? I've been prescribed everything in the past from morphine to opanas but just didn't know how to abuse them. Well, I know the morphine can be melted and boofed but anyway. I just didn't know any better and didn't like any high but oxy. 

Obviously I'm legit hoping they can cure my pain. I've heard she's a miracle worker.

My first assignment was simply called, ""I Am"" That's the only parameters or guidelines that they gave you for the assignment, so I kind of took it and ran with it.

Hello my captive audience, you are my favorite kind

Like it or not, I'll barrage you with thoughts, about me of my own mind.

Intelligent and bright, self-absorbed; full of might, my folks first born.

Raised dutifully and right, though I am of the left, an attractive young man, his chin a slight cleft.

Forthcoming and relateable, but with beliefs undebateable 

stubborn and cocky, and a tinge ungrateful.

As a boy becomes older his own thoughts become colder, with praise he's adorned, though his self doubt does smolder.

The facade he erects is one to expect: loud yet profound, sarcastic and petty, easy to detect, an image unsteady.

Full of wit, full of shit, silver tongued and dishonest, an aimless inferno, a directionless comet.

Empathetic yet self-serving, a bit undeserving, high thoughts of himself he continues deserting.

Radiant, cerebral, stunning and regal, is the look he projects though self talk is still feeble.

Let us not forget, this man is aware, though erratic and volatile, he has *illustrious* hair.

Persuasive, corrosive, distasteful, explosive

Profane and verbose, loquacious, abrasive, and stoic.

Attentive and memorable, defiant and dependent,

An exterior splendid, yet within still detested.

He can be hypocritical, atypical, forgiving yet cautious; sardonic and raucous, he's seldom literal.

As you hear in this work

His vocab is beserk

His demeanor alert

His ambitions inert

You suppose that there's perks of knowing this twerp

But if you took it from him you wouldn't be sure

He just shows he's a jerk 

And in process of attempting to show him his worth

His self sabotage lurches from the shadows it lurked

You proceed to be hurt

Then it's all over and we both feel like dirt.

What I hope that you learned from this excerpt,

Was a man not understanding of his own self worth.

Because when everyone loves you, but nobody *likes* you,

That is the loneliest feeling on Earth",1520563406.0

I have one I've always wanted to share.

It was around this time of year, 5 years ago. It was my first year into heroin switching from Oxycodone IR 30MG, same story as many. They became too expensive, needed to take too many to get the same experience - heroin was a good ""alternative."" Co-worker was already on the stuff and shot me up for my first taste. My tax return just dropped, I spent $1000 out of the $1800 I got, some on black tar, some on cocaine. I had just picked up from my guy and pulled into the same apartment complex I have always gone to after I picked up and prepped my shot. It was in the back, more empty than usual, I backed up into a parking space so I can see the road/entrance. Somebody must of seen the lighter and what I was doing, or the police saw me pullin. I see headlights, glance ahead, and I see two cop cars speeding right into the complex coming *right* to me. I immediately shoved everything under my bench seat of my two seater 1996 Dodge Dakota, grab my phone and I act like I'm speaking on the phone.

What happened next I've never experienced before. This sense of overwhelming calm came over me as the police officers parked in front of me to block me in and they approach me as I act like I say goodbye and throw the phone on the dashboard, making sure they saw I was on the phone. They came up and asked me what I was doing there so late at night as well as for my insurance and ID. As I'm getting all of it out for them, I explain that I had been fighting with my girlfriend and have been driving around for the past hour trying to clear my head - I was just on the phone with her officer. One officer (who had this very distinct blonde hair) takes my info and goes back to the car to run the info, the other tries to size me up and asks me more questions. Do you guys fight a lot? Where do you live? Do you live with her? I had lucked out so much that my gym bag was in the back of my truck where they clearly saw, I claimed it had some clothes I left over her house when she threw me out - I had just played pickup soccer a few hours previously. All it had was my cleats, water, ball and shorts; but it looked packed full.

The blonde officer comes out of his car and motions for the other officer to join him, I barely hear him but he says, ""He is clean, but before he leaves - ask him if we can search the vehicle."" This entire point I wasn't shaking, my heart was beating steady at the same pace as if I was resting. I just accepted whatever that was going to happen, was. 

He tells me I'm free to leave, but if they can search the car before I go. I take a second and look at in front of me like I'm sad and shrug and shake my head, I tell him, ""Officer, it's been a really long night and I would rather just be on my way home to get some sleep."" He looks at me for two seconds nodding and says , ""Okay, have a good night and drive safe."" Hands me back my ID and Insurance. They leave, and I freak the *fuck* out on the way home. 

That was the last time I ever tried to fix up in a car again. Anybody else want to share some good stories? ",1520561322.0

Don't get me wrong, I love free dope, but when he throws me extra, it makes it impossible to say something the next time when it's short.

As far as dboys go, he's a pretty good one, but occasionally he's short a few points. He always fixes the issue and never questioned me about it. There's nothing worse then barely getting enough money together to pick up some that will barely be enough to last until the next time you get money. Then you get home and realize that your g is a point short. Now, you will run out a day early and be sick. You can't say shit because your last pick-up he threw you an extra 3 points.

Just give me the exact amount I'm paying for, or if you're going to be throwing extra in.... Don't be short the next time! We're dealing with people being sick.

He had a heart attack a few years ago, and has horrible nerve pain /cramps/ spasms in his legs. On top of that he now has either a neck or shoulders problem that he suspects is from lying on his side (which is the only comfortable position for him to be in) that will require a surgery. Understandably his work performance has suffered the past year. Especially when they fired someone, threw him into a new position while expecting him to still do his regular job and learn about a completely new market to him. 

It just bugs the hell out of me because it is one manager who is a complete asshole and is out to get him  ever since he came on board. My dad is as high up as a chem engineer can get in his company and is highly respected for his knowledge in the field. He confided some personal problems with this new asshole, who then used it against him during a performance review. Now hes being forced into retirement, he might get a disability package  but he is completely depressed and doesnt know whats gonna happen next. He is turning 60 this year and doesnt have quite enough for retirement, or at least what he planned on having (mortgage is almost done but not done yet, still paying off a car). He said he would love to get a new job at a different company and tell that to the vice president before he leaves as a big F U. But he likes the VP, its just this one guy. I doubt hes gonna do that, he is in too much pain and not enough energy.

Now its my turn to do what my father did before me and my grandfather did before him... i gptta take some responsibility and figure things out. I am 2 years into my engineering degree but due to fucking around with drugs and a liver treatment i have fallen behind. Still probly another 4 years to my degree. I live with my girlfriend and she is in school too. My brother is kind of a mess up, he went to college but fucked around with coke and also has severe dyslexia. He could never make it through certain courses due to partying + dyslexia so he ended up dropping out and gettinf a+ certified as well as some other IT stuff. But basically the responsibility has fallen mainly on me, the youngest, to figure out who is gonna take care of who. Fuck, i just turned 20 on the 4th but feel like i am 30. 

/rant

Anyways,this is where the opiate part comes into play. Ive been on opiates/dope for 5 years and subs for 2. However my dad is gonna loose his health insurance at the end of the year and ill be unable to afford subs (maybe the doc visits but definetly not subs). I have recently relapsed and been going back and forth unfortunatley. It happened trying to get off subs too fast i think. I was fine all the way down to .125mg, then things got shitty. Anyways my plan was to taper back down to .25 (im on like .5mg and still uncomfortable but after 3-4 days ill be good again) and then just stabilize. Finish the semester out (im in calculus and CANT take that a 3rd time, i NEED it for my other classes) . Then at the beginning of the summer, check in to a detox while i still have insurance and ride the withdrawal demon posession out. That will be my first time in detox so i am not sure what to expect. I really would prefer to avoid rehab as i have heard tons of terrible things about rehabs, primarily that they only make you a craftier addict with more connects. I also am not sure what to expect in terms of payment. Does insurance cover it? I always seem to end up having to pay tons anyways with insurance even tho its supposedly great insurance. This way i can use the supervised detox option and get out of this addiction while i still have insurance. Any thoughts on this plan? I wanted to ride it out myself at the beginning of the summer but i know that i will end up buying dope on day 3 or 4 tops because my will power just gets completely rekt by then.  I figure step one would be to take care of myself and figure out this addiction, then handle this big task of life one step at a time.",1520554354.0

Thank God this will be the last time I'm seeing the woman (I call her Nurse Ratchet a la ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) who always finds a way to inject ""you're just too young to be on pain meds like this sweetie/honey/darlin' *, we're going to have to start taking your doses down soon"" (no shit I'm too young for this, I'm also too young for this kind of pain). Normally this clinic sends me a text to confirm my appointment, then also calls me to confirm. This month was the same as any other. Got my text Monday and replied that I'd be there, got a call, ignored it. That's my usual monthly routine. 

So this morning when I get up earlier than usual, I decide I'm going to head out to the area of the clinic a bit early, maybe treat myself to an ice cream or something. Get out to my car... and it won't start. Goddammit. Call my insurance agent to make sure they can send someone to jump it, they can, so Joe Smith's Towing**  comes out and tried to get me going. After a few tries he tells me he thinks it might be my fuel pump. According to him, by the sounds my car is making, it's trying its damndest to start but it doesn't sound like any gas is getting to the engine. Fuckity fuck fuck fuck. A few more tries, and I realize I need to call an Uber. 

Uber gets there and I have an uneventful ride. Lovely husband takes the afternoon off so he can meet me at the clinic after my appointment, take me to the pharmacy afterward to fill my script (at this point, really the only positive I've got going for me) and then we can go home and relax. When I get to the clinic and walk in, no one is in the waiting room and they're in the process of rescheduling some dude. That's not a good sign. My turn comes up, and they tell me I need to reschedule for next week. They'll give me a ""bridge script"" to last me until then, as I am completely out of one of my meds. They ""tried calling me both Tuesday and Wednesday"" to let me know Nurse Ratchet wasn't going to be in today but couldn't get a hold of me. 

I have one week's worth of meds, and tonight I am going to be taking a bath with a fancy bath bomb and a glass of wine and anyone who tries to disturb me is going to get their ass kicked to the MOON. At least they didn't completely fuck me over, I guess. A week's worth is better than nothing.

* she always finds a way to call me some absolutely patronizing and frustrating pet name while at the same time attempting to invalidate my pain because of my age. This kind of bullshit is one of the main reasons I'm leaving.

i dont understand how i am supposed to make it into appointments when the last 2 ER doctors refuse to treat me b.c. i am on bupe/suboxone?


theres not much i can do when i am not eating and not sleeping and therefore cannot move to make an appointment . and the last 2 ER visits were connected to the same hospital and they did not spend more than 2 minutes with me total . and gave me ibuprofen . told me to go to pain management . 


I called another emergency room and told them i was on suboxone, this emergencyroom havng a pain clinic and they told me to come in but after having a 2 hour arguement with my parents over the pain, i honestly am uninterested.


I wake up on a dailybasis and pop pills that are giving me fucking ulcers.
i.e. i either take 4 ibuprofen+2 tylenol, meloxicam+tylenol, or diclofenac+acetaminophen+
 suboxone, in combination with a muscle relaxer
and its not putting a dent in my pain
4 different meds at the same time and i am still in extreme pain

oh, and klonopin, too, for the spasms , anxiety and insomnia 


I scream and cry almost everyday in throws of agony .

I may plan to switch to heroin if this doesnt get better. am tired of being in pain & treated like shit .

I would like to be admitted to the hospital but i have afunny feeling unless i fake symptoms that it wont happen unless i go there on the exact minute that i am in serious pain before popping all of these meds. i am zombiefied now . wish i was dead. fuck USA . fuck all of you who get meds and dont need them. waste of a country. fuck the war on drugs and anyone who supports it. fuck you . yes. you.


fuck the police for arresting people rather than treating them
fuck our country for making stupid policies and laws regarding opiate epidemic when the main epidemic is from FENTANYL and people mixing drugs , not many people actually die from taking oxy alone or even get addicted. infact only 5% of people that take meds for pain actually get addicted to them",1520551354.0

I definitely missed a little bit, and eventually a scab formed there. For a couple of weeks the toe was numb, but that didn‚Äôt seem to abnormal seeing as the shot had some coke in it. Anyways, the scab just seemed as if it were never going to go away, but I really didn‚Äôt pay it any more attention than that. However, the other day I hit the toe, and scab and it hurt incredibly bad. From that point the toe got red around the scab, and began to hurt much more. So about ten minutes ago I started to pick at the scab, and almost immediately it basically popped and started draining fluid out of it. Eventually I got the scab off, and what was left underneath it was just a legit hole in my toe, which is what led me to think abscess. I have never had one though so I am not totally sure if that‚Äôs accurate. Also I‚Äôm not totally sure on how to treat an open hole in my toe. I just put some Neosporin on it and called it a day.

I order from the DNM once and only once a month. I get very slight withdrawal, basically a cold and some restlessness at night for roughly 3-4 days after that week. Sometimes I only have enough for 3 or 4 days, depends on how quickly I decide to go through it. From the beginning I told myself the first time I break my once a month rule that I would stop doing it completely. I just wanted to clear something up. Chipping doesn‚Äôt work when you are immersed in the junkie lifestyle. It doesn‚Äôt work if you have already gotten into it deep in the past. It doesn‚Äôt work if the friends you hang out with do H. It doesn‚Äôt work if H is a primary factor in your life. And it doesn‚Äôt work if you even for a second entertain the idea of doing it more often then you initially planned. I don‚Äôt think I am any better then anyone else, I really don‚Äôt. I just get so frustrated by some of the comments here. I hate that even users here are pushing all the societal stigmas on everyone else. What happened to being responsible for yourself ? Anyone should be able to do anything they want as long as it doesn‚Äôt negatively effect others. I don‚Äôt care how long and how much you have been using and how deep into the shit hole that is addiction that you‚Äôve gotten, the fact is at some point in time you either didn‚Äôt come up with a plan, or you eventually broke your plan. Heroin can complete take over your life, for that reason it should be avoided by most people, I just wish people would take responsibility for it. So much advice is, don‚Äôt do it because you will def have it ruin your life. That isn‚Äôt harm reduction, and by coming at someone with that advice you are doing more harm then good. If that person decides to try it anyway then it‚Äôs already been planted in their head that they are fucked. The most important advice we should be giving is that it creeps up on you, the high seems so benign and harmless, until it‚Äôs not. That should be the focus of all harm reduction advice for first timers, let people try it if they want, just focus on making sure they don‚Äôt make a habit of it. Of course I don‚Äôt advocate using it, I would never recommend someone use, but there are a couple facts that no one wants to admit. You are not addicted after the first or second time you use it. Probably not even after the third or fourth. That‚Äôs a FACT,  but no one wants to admit. Also one last thing. People also link being addicted to drugs to stealing and lying and cheating. That‚Äôs stuff isn‚Äôt a direct result of the drugs, it‚Äôs a direct result of not having money ! Doing drugs doesn‚Äôt turn you into a morally bankrupt individual, it‚Äôs needing to pay for them that does. I am sorry for this long rant, sometimes it‚Äôs cathartic to just ramble on and I really appreciate being able to do that here, it means a lot. This isn‚Äôt a brag, I‚Äôm not trying to come off as condescending, I just think drug use should be judged on an individual basis, case by case. As human beings, we are so much stronger then we know, we have so much more Control then we know, the sooner you realize that and exercise it, the better things will be. ",1520543768.0

And we also talked about that I just sleep all day and I am nevertheless tired all the time. I know that it could come from the dope but I use now since one year and it wasnt as hard as now.

 Its not the noddiness or tiredness from dope its because of sth else. A vitamin test would cost me much so he said we will do that as last chance. 

He prescribed me some citalopram because I cant sleep sometimes. because of the death of my dad and then I think sometimes all the night about many things and in such nights I just sleep about a few hours. So he said he will give me some citalopram for the sleeping problems. 

I should take 1 pill one hour before I go to bed. My question would be is it safe to take that pill and also use my dope? As far as I know its a serotonin blocker aka antidepressiva. I am not depressed. But I was depressed in the past. I will call him next week and tell him that it dont work for me because I want some benzos from him.

What would be the smartest way to do that? I thought about telling him that I am not relaxed before I go to bed and that I think about many things and that I am scarred because of that often. 

About 3 month ago every doctor in my area gave you a script for benzos but I think they started the same thing like they did with opioids. The doctors prescribed them often for many light pain in the past, like one year ago but they stopped that because of the american opioid crisis and they are scarred that things can get rough again in germany. 

In the late 80's we were the number one country for heroin. They smuggled it from here to all european countries because of our law system. 

So much to the back story. Now what they did in the last year they went to all the doctors in the rural areas and informed them aboit the abuse. Because in the rural areas we got many doctors who are in their late 50's-60's and they are used to give you opioids for all injurries. But now they wont give them out so easy as before. I think they made the same thing with benzos too. 

So my two questions are:
1. Is it safe to take citalopram 20mg 1 pill a night and also use my .2 dope before I go to bed?
2. What would be the smartest way to tell my doctor that I want some benzos? I know that asking isnt the right way. Bit maybe if I tell him that I readed much in the internet and that I think that diazepam or alprazolam or clonazepam would help much better. I also will tell him that I get extrmly itchy if I take the citalopram and that I nearly puke everytime plus that my  body circulation  went down extremly and that I nearly broke down. I will tell him that I will definitly not take one more of these pills. I also tell hin that they made everything worse for me. 

Sorry for the long text guys but I needed to get that off of my heart. And unfortunately I didnt got anybody who knows that I use dope. 

Much love to y'all and stay sage fam. ",1520542360.0

I'm scared. This started out and just a one time thing and I had no clue how this drug they call heroin just sticks it's fucking nails into you drags you down. I found out my bf was using and soon became intrigued of this drug and the feelings it made him feel, how all worries were just gone. I wanted a taste, and boy did I get a mouthful. It's been since July of last year, that was my first time. I remember the day and all of it's details. I wish I could go back to that day, where everything was fine and we were happy and not struggling. Since that day everything has gone down hill. We've lost both of our cars, lost our apartment, all of our belongings, just had what we could fit into a couple suitcases. We thankfully came into another car, but not for long. We slept in that car together for months, and him by himself for a month or two as well. We both were lucky enough to go back to our parents, but today my dad took back the plates off the car because of unpaid tickets. Tickets that I had no clue of.

I mean not my life, it's in shambles. But I've only been taking kratom for the longest now. And it's been okay. Until yesterday.

Yesterday I was putting all my stuff in storage, and messed my back up. The entire reason I originally got into pain management was because of spinal stenosis and bulging discs. I always deal with some pain. But right now it's horrible. It's excruciating.  

I have to do something. I can either spend $60 on a massage and hope it helps. Or spend $50 on 100 mcghr fent patch. It wouldn't make me high, but it'll probably help with the pain .  I only have about 10 minutes to make this decision.  So please give me your thoughts and opinions. 

Edit: well the response is pretty clear. So I'm at the spot right now, she says 6 minutes and she'll be here. I'll update again in an hour or so, to let you know if it's working. 

Edit2: putting them on now. You guys think running the heater in my car will make them kick in faster?

Edit3: so I was misinformed. I got 2, 25mcghr patches. So I put one on. Should I put the other on also? She said I should chew it. I don't want to get fucked up, I just want a little relief. Thoughts? 

EditFinal: it's 4pm eastern time. And I took my kids to play. My back hurts,  but it went from a 8/9 to an easy 4/5. Thanks for all the help family. ",1520698849.0

Silver spoon and then some. After secondary school I knew any additional schooling would be 100% paid for by my parents. That alone is a huge luxury in this country. My father wanted me to get a job and work through university though. Learn the value of a dollar, and show a little ambition. Have structure.

That was when I discovered the power of drugs. I was working as a bank teller, hating it. A conversation between a dealer buddy and I started out half joking, and then got serious. It led to me getting blow cheap to sell. I made $500 the first Friday I had anything.

You know that stereotypical anti-drug advertising, where you better not try anything once or it'll hook you in forever? Blow wasn't like that for me at all. Even with a ton of it around I never had the urge to do it. I quit my job and kept selling drugs, telling my dad everything was going well at the bank. Paid for a few of my own things to keep up the lies. 

A girl I was seeing and fell head over heels for was a major party girl. She was like a vacuum cleaner, and she was the one who introduced me to my first oxy. Now THAT first time was a major woah experience. I liked it so much I knew I had to stay away from it. But I liked this girl and she did it often, so I tried to do it maybe once a week. And then it was on weekends. This went on for a few months, when things got worse. I was doing oxy every day, and when my connects all ran dry, I went to a friends junkie uncle to help me out. He was a super nice guy who would charge you a premium, or take a bit of whatever you bought. I didn't mind obviously, it was his connect. 

After 6 months I burnt out. I was doing oxy every god damn day, and not selling nearly enough blow to warrant it. And then oxy wasn't doing anything for me. So I started smoking it. That lasted a while before I craved more. I asked my friends uncle if shooting it was worth it. 

He told me if a drug isn't doing ""enough"" for you, and you want to switch your method on how you do it, it is time to cut back. If a line of blow isn't enough and you want to start smoking crack, turn back. He said it's the same way with oxys/down, anything. 

This whole time in my deluded mind I wasn't a junkie. I just did oxy. It's not like I was on that dreaded H-word. Well two weeks ago was my first time doing actual H. Pure bliss again, a feeling I missed. Last night was my first night shooting it. I convinced my friends uncle to do it or I was going to find someone else who would. I couldn't believe what I had been missing out on. 

When the feeling was over I had never felt so depressed in my entire life. My schooling is a joke, I have told endless lies to my parents for money. Making up all kinds of excuses about school, even faking documents. I feel like the biggest fuck up on earth. I bet none of this makes sense, I felt so depressed yesterday after shooting up for the first time all I wanted to do was drink. And pick up more h. I bet none of this makes sense but I have no one to turn to and I feel like I fucked up my entire life for good. When I think about it for too long all I do is text my buddies uncle asking him to pick up for me. ",1520672860.0

I decided to keep this account for now. For some reason.

I wrote this while very high 3 days ago, planning to post it here:

**Background Info**

I've been using heroin on and off for about a year and a half. Plugging mostly. I've tried snorting and it had very little effect, and I don't have the equipment or the right kind of H to smoke it (I still did once try to smoke it off foil - unsuccessfully).

I've had a codeine habit for many years now. It started with lower doses and once or twice a week, then it gradually developed. I cycled between taking it every second day, taking it every day, and going through withdrawals. 

When I started using heroin I alternated the two. Soon I realised I did not have the money for a heroin habit, and had to rely on codeine again.

After a period of regularly taking very large doses of codeine and getting sick from it, I limited my dosages. But I still continued using it as much as I could.

I also bought small amounts of heroin whenever I could afford it. I would plug it a few times a day and it would last me 2-3 days, then I'd go back to codeine. I have weaned off opiates completely a few times.

I decided to try shooting up - to see what it's like and hopefully get the same effects as plugging while using less (saving money) and having it last longer. 

I got all the supplies I needed last week, and I did a successful test run with just water. I'm grateful for all the online resources and redditors who gave me advice.

I got the package of H delivered yesterday and I successfully injected heroin for the first time. I waited an hour or so and did another shot. 

I did the same thing today, had one shot, waited to see how it went, and then emptied the rest of the bag to make another shot.

I got through 100mg of apparently pure #4 in two days. I don't know if this is a lot, but guides I've read say 5-15mg is a usual dose for someone with no tolerance.

**Observed Effects**

- I didn't get an instant rush like in the movies - at first I thought I must have done it wrong and it wasn't gonna work.
- Initial rush built up over a few minutes - it was probably 30 seconds or less before I felt the initial effects and then it peaked after a few minutes.
- Caused flushing/redness on the face and neck and feeling hot.
- The rush was not as intense or euphoric as I expected. It did feel good, but it took a few minutes to peak so it happened while I was putting away all my equipment and I felt a little incapacitated, but the feeling didn't last long. It was, however, intense enough to make me worry that I'd had too much. Then once it wore off I realised I wasn't really all that high.
- Other than the initial effects, very similar to plugging, except less is needed and it lasts longer.
- Nodding hard and feeling like I might pass out but can still lie awake for hours just enjoying the comfort/calm.
- Strong desire to fight the urge to sleep.
- Can't focus vision for reading or writing - must close one eye to focus (could be side effects from meds and/or vision problems I have, both exacerbated by heroin).
- No nausea.
- Itchiness - I enjoy scratching - doesn't happen every time though.
- Hard to keep eyes open / open eyes once they are closed.
- Mind keeps drifting - hard to focus.
- I can function and act normally when I get up to make food/interact with people.
- No noticeable effects on coordination like with benzos.
- Also no apparent memory loss.
- Doesn't take all depression away - just takes the edge off.
- Helps my anxiety - calm, relaxed, more confident.
- Different kind of sedation / relaxation than benzos. Sometimes I don't notice much effect from benzos unless I'm treating high anxiety, and if I take a huge dose I get very sleepy and feel no desire to fight the urge to fall asleep, and so I just sleep.
- Definitely gives me more of a high than benzos.
- Soothes any irritation or agitation.
- Increases my interest in things and also reduces my ability to hold my attention so my ADHD worsens and I try to do several things at once and keep forgetting what I was doing.
- Losing my train of thought a lot but I worry less about forgetting things - this is usually a source of anxiety for me.
- Everything seems easier - more motivation, mundane tasks can be fun.
- A lot of mental imagery - vivid visual and sound imagery, and dream like thoughts and images.
- Being lost in thoughts that make no sense.
- I ""wake"" from these dream like states and think how weird and nonsensical the thoughts/images were.
- Not exactly euphoric, but I rarely experience euphoria - codeine is possibly more euphoric for me but it's very short lived.
- Reduction in negative thoughts - more neutral / reflective thinking.
- Some mild closed eye visuals.
- I don't get munchies but I feel like eating because the pleasure is enhanced.
- I rarely get nauseous from H, even when I've been nodding hard. But I have thrown up a few times from taking large numbers of codeine pills (not CWE - just swallowing the pills).
- I don't get hiccups like I do with codeine.
- All my physical ailments feel better.

In some ways plugging is better - hard to explain - but it's worth it to get better value out of the bag.

At first I felt guilt and shame about my first time shooting up ... then I realised this is because of the stigma, negative stereotypes, and myths.

Now I feel good about doing it. Now I know it's an option, and now I know I can master injecting myself and it makes me feel in control.

I've fantasised about shooting up heroin for years (mostly as escapism, but I'm also fascinated with needles), but kept telling myself I would never do it, because I don't even know how, and people say that the instant rush gets you hooked and after that nothing will ever compare. 

Well now I can say that's not true for me, at least. I would definitely still prefer plugging or taking codeine at times. And there are many situations I prefer other drugs. Opiates aren't to me very social drugs; I only ever do them at home by myself. And benzos are much more of a necessity for me than opiates.

I also still think LSD is my favourite recreational drug. And Ketamine is a very different kind of drug but I would prefer it over shooting up heroin. It's even more expensive, but provides way more escapism (so much so that, depending on the dose, it's not the best drug to take if you want to be able to function).

*(I think I wrote this part as a sort of response to the people who reacted negatively to my post about planning to try injecting)*

I wouldn't encourage anyone to try any drug. But instead of trying to influence someone's decision, I would listen to what they have to say, and answer any questions, focusing on harm reduction, and refer them to resources, since I have limited knowledge. I would also share personal experiences but emphasise that it's different for everyone. 

I believe in bodily autonomy and personal freedom, so people being able to do what they want with their own bodies fits with my values.

But I also respect the seriousness of drug addiction as a mental illness, but this post will be too long if I get into that.

*Prologue*

Firstly, I wouldn't recommend injecting heroin. It's not that great. Movies make it seem way more fun than it is. I've had way better times on LSD. Opiates as a whole are very addictive regardless of whether they are any fun or not. For me, they are less fun and more a coping mechanism. The addiction can develop very gradually. The pleasure of using is heightened exponentially when I'm going through withdrawal. Once I'm out of the withdrawal phase, I don't crave it as much and if I relapse it's usually because I'm trying to suppress emotions. I think maybe as an addict I'll always want it even though I know it's not that good. When I'm using a lot I can't imagine life having any meaning without it. But a lot of that has to do with depression too.

I think the message I really wanna get out is harm reduction and part of that is ending the stigma. Another huge part is access to mental health care, safe injection clinics, free access to sterile needles and other supplies, decriminilisation, and I'll go even further to say (regulated) access to pure, pharmaceutical grade heroin, so you know what dose you're getting, you can taper using heroin under the supervision of a doctor if that's how you choose to get off it, the street market becomes mostly redundant, users are less stigmatised, maybe users don't have to spend as much money to support their addiction if it's sold in a regulated rather than a totally free market, and maybe their lives aren't totally ruined by what is a treatable mental illness.

But most of that is my utopian dream world.

*Here's what I did right*

- I did a lot of research. 
- I followed https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Safer_injection_guide.
- I asked for advice here (some gave very helpful advice, others told me I'm a disgrace). 
- I went to the chemist and got sterile needles (as part of a needle exchange program), alcohol wipes, cotton buds, and sterile containers for mixing.
- I used heroin from a trusted vendor that I'd used before (I also should have tested the batch using a different ROA before injecting).
- I got distilled water to dissolve it in. The pharmacist said it would be in the laundry section at the supermarket, and that's where I found it. 
- I poured the heroin into the sterile container, then I filled the syringe about halfway with distilled water, which I squirted onto the heroin. Then I used a cotton bud to mix it and used the same cotton as a filter (should have used a better mixing tool and a better filter). I drew the solution up through the cotton, then got rid of all air bubbles.
- I made sure to keep everything sterile that was going to touch my skin.
- I used alcohol wipes on the area before and after injection (should have also applied bandaids).
- I started with a small dosage (should have been even smaller tbh).
- I was very careful about making sure I knew where the vein was, injecting at the correct angle and being sure I was in the vein (except for one incident below), then only injecting the smallest amounts in increments. 

*Here's what I did wrong*

- I didn't tell anyone I was shooting up heroin. 
- I did it alone, in the bathroom.
- I didn't acquire any form of naloxone in case of overdose.
- I didn't write a note to say what I'd taken in case of overdose.
- I didn't go to a safe injection clinic, which is available where I live.
- I tried injecting when I wasn't in a vein (need to see blood in the barrel to be sure). Luckily the liquid just seeped out of the hole I'd injected it into. A lot worse can happen.
- I tried to inject in through the same hole twice at a different angle to get into a vein. It was ultimately successful but led to a lot of bleeding.
- I didn't weigh the powder to get the right dosage (must get better mg scales).
- I forgot to untie the tourniquet before injecting (it is pretty difficult to do all this with two hands). Probably lead to increased bleeding, but worse can happen.
- Again, I did this alone, but also wrong for a different reason. This was my first time self injecting. I should have been with someone who knew what they were doing and could guide me. (I don't know anyone who uses heroin, which is probably a good thing overall).

I also decided to do this after I'd gone 3 weeks without opiates (purely due to lack of money and the 1 Feb change to make codeine prescription only), and then had two relapses with prescribed codeine, but not enough to cause any withdrawals. 

Now, after injecting heroin two days in a row and having no withdrawals, it's been 3 days, and I could keep it going, but I still want to do it again...",1520661474.0

To give you an idea, I harvested some #4 from my onion patch and snorted 50mg. For the first hour or more, I was sky high, but for the next 3, I was throwing up lunch, breakfast, and yesterday's dinner. I now keep my doses to around 20-35mg.

I gave my friend, who I've seen shoot a gram of some fire obsidian black and just be sorta chillin, little nod here and there, 200mg. He proceeded to shoot it all and couldn't complete coherent sentences. So strong stuff you know? I wouldn't say it's absolutely pure, those are only in hospitLs, but pretty up there.

Now my question is, how much oxycodone would I need to snort and/or eat to achieve the 20-35mg high? I like oxys more cuz I'm a stim guy, I like to get things done. Oxy provides a stimulating opioid experience that I refuse to adulterate with anything (except my beloved cLam). From my own experience, it seems they're pretty much 1:1.

What about you guys? Heroin or oxy? Also dose equivalency?",1520660758.0

I don‚Äôt want to add any confusion with all the other shit I wanna say, so I‚Äôll just leave it at that. Does anyone have any clue about this or any suggestions/websites/advice/etc to give me??

But what's virtually never included in any of this is potentiation **instructions**. 

The two main ones I'm using are grapefruit juice and agmatine, and so for brevity I suppose this post will just involve these. What I'd like to know is, A., how much one should be taking to induce peak potentiation, and most importantly, B., the dose scheduling AKA the timing of potentiation. WHEN and HOW MANY TIMES do you use the potentiators? Do you take it:

* before dosing (how long before)

* when you dose

* after the dose kicks in

and do you repeatedly take it? 

Alright so it's just this: long story short, what are the exact instructions for exactly how much, when, and how often one is supposed to use the potentiator? I'm tired of having no idea if I'm wasting my potentiators or not or if there's just a way better way I should be doing it. Again, I'm seeking answers for grapefruit juice and agmatine. Unless there's another one that you swear by as being better (that is easily available and not sketchy), then I'd like to hear about that too.

NOT OD. I've got some hydro IR 15mg and some that are 20mg but have a protective coating making it harder for people to snort the drug. I've snorted 30mg and taken 20mg orally and also taken 4mg of ativan(I have a EXTREMELY high benzo tolerance, so that dose is nothing to me) over the past 11:30 hours. I'm pretty high and am nodding out if I'm not focused on something specific. I feel like I'm breathing fine. And am having very minimal trouble coordinating myself around the house. No slurred speech.
 My question is do you think it would be safe to break apart another 15mg and snort it at 5mg periods throughout the rest of the night. I have cool water, my albuterol inhaler, and my phone on my nightstand. 
 
TL;DR: 
  I've taken 4mg of ativan(with a EXTREMELY high benzo tolerance), 20mg oxycodone orally, and snorted 2, 15mg oxys over the last 11.5 hours.

&nbsp;

A couple of days ago I bought dope with my buddy Tim and told Cliff I couldn't buy dope with him because I needed a tech certification. It was nice getting high without spending double. It was nice not paying a massive middler fee. It was nice not having to share and split the order after paying so much. 


Sure, I always got paid back for the dope I bought him but I can't put roxies into my bank account. Ever try paying a phone bill with roxies? Most carriers don't accept that form of payment. Also, if I have to wait two or three days for a potential buyer to get paid, by then I usually end up consuming those roxies.


&nbsp;


**I'm so happy** that I saved and have so much money left over from pay day.


Highlights of things I spent my money on:


* A low cost drone by recommendation of a member of this community.

* Stargate Command Membership.

* Some subs for myself.

* Tools for my bike.





**Attention Stargate fans**: Pay $20 for a SGC membership. Not only will you be able to stream every Stargate movie and TV episode but you will get a tee shirt!

I can't wait to get my Stargate tee shirt! 

Also streaming, new episodes of the new show, Stargate Origins. Sadly, the last three episodes just came out for streaming. Ten episodes total, I feel like it barely started and it's already over. The format is that of a bunch of short webisodes. Combined they equal a two part episode in length. 



&nbsp;

A Stargate Command membership enables to you view the episodes via the web and a mobile app. The app is available for both iOS and Android. 



Now, to shop for furniture for my turtles and that mercury vapor lamp. It's nice being not spending ever last dollar on dope and subs.


&nbsp;


I got the subs on D-day but I kept them for myself. I picked up a couple more that Cliff paid me for today and let him have those. From here on out, I'll be well. **Cliff gets paid mid week, if or when when he offers me free dope to borrow until I get paid, I MUST decline.** If I owe him for the dope, then I gotta pay for that + any dope that he wants on loan. Two weeks from now when I get paid again I must at least do as I've done this past week. 


I must not make any more of my money available to Cliff for dope. I'm very satisfied with the outcome of my most recent pay day and want things to go like that in the future as well.


&nbsp;


I don't know if I'll buy dope next pay day but I'm planning on not buying any dope. If I do, I'm definitely not getting it through Cliff because I never want to split an order with him again. I'm not responsible for his ability to get high and if he tries to offer me a loan this week I'll decline. It'll be that much more dope for him. 


Plus, I've already gone above and beyond to help him get subs and if he wants to pay for more in the not too distant future, I'd be happy to help him get more if it's not terribly inconvenient for me.

&nbsp;


I enjoyed getting high the past couple of days but I don't know if the high outweighs the negatives. Just two noticeable negatives. The skin around eyes gets itchy. I try to resist rubbing my eyes and I still end up rubbing them. This time I did an okay job of resisting but I still crossed the line with rubbing as is evident under my left eye 

I've been told that the dryness around my eyes was solely due to dehydration. Although it may be a factor, I do believe whatever the cause, I do exasperate it by rubbing around my eyes. The dryness/damage coupled with sleep deprivation causes me to get literal crows feet below my eyes. I know normal crows feet are different but I do get very distinct lines below my eyes.

&nbsp;


The lines go away after a few days of proper care and hydration once I stop taking dope and stop rubbing. Sometimes I put lotion on but I've learned that the skin ends up looking **way worse if you put lotion on damaged skin.** Skin must be allowed to heal before applying any moisturizing lotions.

&nbsp;


What I learned and experienced in concise points:



* The skin below my eyes get fucked up wen I rub them every single time I binge on dope.


* The brain feels weird during the first stage of withdrawal. Dreams too.


* I was able to take a sub just under 12 hours after my last dose. I always start with 2mg. 


* The 2mg of subs helped do the trick. Took a couple of hours to be able tell if it took effect but I felt psychologically well and good before I was done with my second cup of coffee.


* Probably didn't need to take 2mg more. Did anyway. 


* The itchy eyes and the negative mental state when running dry are my primary reasons to no buy dope in the future.


&nbsp;

I'm really glad that I saved so much money that I was able to spend money to invest in the future of the Stargate franchise. I'm also glad that I didn't have to experience full blown dope-sickness and enjoyed keeping my money.",1520651600.0

Then the sensation faded as the injection reached my body temperature. I had a pavlovian effect that made me feel high while the fentanyl was first penetrating my arm. Then came the rush. It was smooth and soothing as the narcotic invaded my willing mind. Pain flew away, and the room brightened. At night I saw colored dots swirling around the small TV. I couldn‚Äôt follow the programs that were on, and I mostly watched Cops and Forensic Files. Crimes were interrupted by commercials as often as by police. Little people crossed the little screen in little cars. Some were dragged off to tiny jails in the television that was smaller than a microwave oven. I had a remote control, but it kept falling off the bed, because my mattress was inflated and sloped down on the sides.

But in the matter of a week (I usually only use once a week) I started feeling little to nothing from it.

But last Saturday I took sub (4mg) and today I took 60mg hydrocodone and 100mg of IV benadryl and felt only a tiny buzz. What gives? The only thing I can think of is that around this same time I started taking duloxetine which is an SNRI for depression after my best friend basically broke up with me. It‚Äôs 20mg everyday. I have to take a temporary tolerance break since I can‚Äôt get anything for a minute cause my connect went to jail for for trespassing? It‚Äôs weird, but my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt plan on keeping me on this medicine forever, it‚Äôs just temporary to help get over this loss. When I‚Äôm done with it, if opiates seem to work as great as they used to again then I‚Äôll know it had something to do with SNRIs.  The only reason I think it might be something other than tolerance is because it was so dramatic and abrupt. Anyone else have experiences like this? With SNRIs and opiates and their interaction?

They are making opiods harder to get prescribed in the first place. i started using heroin at 17 because no doctor would prescribe me anymore than paracetamol for a herniated disc (where i live u dont get opiates unless ur terminal). what alot of people dont realize is that inadequate pain management is just as damaging as throwing around painkillers like skittles as they used to.

as much as i hate the pharma industry for purposefully promoting opiate prescriptions, the end result of cracking down on these pharma quality meds means people will increasingly resort to heroin-- where they dont know the dosage, purity or even the active ingredients. if people are going to do drugs, it was at least a form of harm reduction when people knew their doses, and werent being sold fentanyl in place of heroin. another consequence will be more overdoses.

by making drug laws harsher and restricting supply, price goes up. consequently more dealers are attracted to the market by higher profit margins, increasing supply and availability (it is in fact easier for teens in the US to acquire cocaine/heroin than it is to obtain alchohol!).

most health consequences stem from prohibition. opiates are non-toxic unless you overdose. only now people must resort to IV use to cope with artificially inflated black-market prices (a gram by the way costs 10 cents to produce), injecting god knows what cuts and increasing the risk of OD exponentially. even IV use of pharma grade diacetylmorphine poses little long-term health consequences, at least far less than a glass of wine a day.

if we were tasked with creating a system that made addiction worse-- we would design the same system currently in place.

what makes me sick is how the average person actually supports prohibition and a 'tough on drugs' mentality-- when that same mentality has increased drug use, addiction rates, overdoses and availability EXPONENTIALLY over the past century with no signs of improvement.

the only country with falling addiction rates is Portugal (where all drugs are decriminalized). In Canada, where trials have been introduced where addicts are increasingly prescribed diacetylmorphine (heroin), they are soon able to hold down jobs and support a family.

even in the philippines were drug use receives the death sentance, addiction rates rise.",1520642799.0

http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/911-good-samaritan-fatal-overdose-prevention-law

*From the link: 20 states & the District of Columbia have enacted policies to provide limited immunity from arrest or prosecution for minor drug law violations for people who summon help at the scene of an overdose. New Mexico was the first state to pass such a policy and has been joined in recent years by Alaska, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.
Good Samaritan laws do not protect people from arrest for other offenses, such as selling or trafficking drugs, or driving while drugged. These policies protect only the caller and overdose victim from arrest and/or prosecution for simple drug possession, possession of paraphernalia, and/or being under the influence.*

So while those states do have laws to protect people who summon help to overdose scenes, other states may have laws called ‚ÄúGood Samaritan laws‚Äù but those are basically for underage drinking. 

I‚Äôm not saying abandon your friends to die. But if you live in certain states like Indiana you would be smart to call 911 and run if you have drugs or paraphernalia on you. It‚Äôs also smart to not mention drugs and say ‚Äúthey stopped breathing‚Äù because the 1st responders will have narcan anyways. 

 I have a friend who got charged with dealing H because they found his weed scale when he OD‚Äôd. I have another friend who got slapped with a felony charge (later downgraded) for possession of a syringe. So be careful out there and know the laws of where you live.

Back in 2015 I went to mexico for ibogaine treatment when I was on methadone. The treatment facility I went to was amazing. In a gated community on the beach, always nurses/people on staff to help, you get your own master bedroom, They give you a short acting opiate such as morphine or oxycodone in the days leading up to the treatment, as well as xanax, if needed for sleep. 


The ibogaine trip itself was also an amazing experience, About 1 hour after ingesting the ibogaine I felt relief from all WD's. Then an intense psychedlic trip that I can't compare to anything else, for about 12 hours or so, and then recovery. But after the ibogaine treatment, about 90% of the acute WD was gone, and this was methadone.


The hard part is staying clean, which is why an aftercare plan is very important.


I wish ibogaine was more mainstream and legal, it really can work wonders for WD and getting off of various drugs.


Not to mention, it also seems to 'reset' your tolerance as well, and I am considering doing it again just for this purpose. not to mention just the overall experience the trip, the whole thing was enjoyable, was like a vacation. During treatment I was hooked up to an EKG and a dr had to be on staff the whole time as well as nurses.


I really want to do it again, just for the experience and to maybe try and lower my tolerance to kratom. But its pretty expensive.

The first time I tried to go cold turkey and that did not end pretty. I caved at around 48 hours because I just couldn't take it. So after that I opted for the good ole suboxone taper. And it worked!! I took suboxone for about 8 days slowly tapering off and at around day 15 or 16 I was totally fine. Checkmate, dope, I win.  Right? Nope. At day 17 I had the tiniest little resurgence of withdrawal craving pangs and I immediately called my dealer and caved within 20 minutes. I am the weakest willed person on earth, yeah, I know. One day of dope turned into two, and then three.  But here's the thing: now the drug test is truly upon me as the drug test can be any time next week so I absolutely CANNOT use anything, as I cannot risk not getting this job in any way whatsoever, the shame of facing my family for failing a drug test would be too much to bear and would ruin my relationship with my parents forever. 

But here's the point of my post: The physics of addiction are fucking bullshit. After using dope for a measly 3 days after being clean for 17 I am back to square one in terms of withdrawal. And now I REALLY have to pay the piper, as I MUST NOT use anything under any circumstance. Now I'm in my own little hell of withdrawal that I've designed myself, and cannot escape even though I want to and have the means, with thousands of dollars in the bank and plenty of connects. I am currently 48 hours into WD's and purely miserable. I absolutely cannot take suboxone as I'm terrified it will register on the test due to its extremely long half life.

While true, we pirates think fondly of the Rrrrr, but truly our hearts belong in the C.


----

Ok this one is a little more simple, but also since I'm making the contest, I naturally have to make it as convoluted as possible. No BTC right now to giveaway, but the fent strips did come in.


I have chosen 3 numbers by sacrificing 3 children to Cthulu'. He expressed great joy by reciting these three numbers.  

Unforutantly for me, this has led me unable to get high. Everytime I doin heroinfentsadeine, I feel more sober.


I am cursed.


So I need your help to break this curse! Each of you can guess 3 numbers. Be warned! The goal isn't to guess the numbers, is to avoid the Mad One's number! For one accidental guess with make you automatically lose, and on top of that, you will be punished.


The punishment for reciting the Number of the Danmed (any of them)....is ~~death~~, you must say a nice, and positive thing about every single person who has posted before you, do this, and you will be spared, and receive the consolation prize of one test kit).

The winner will be the one whose 3 numbers are furthest away on the integer numbering system. (i.e. if the number is 25, 88, 198), a possible winning guess can be 120, 121, 122, if no one has a ""farther guess"", like (123, 124, 125). They're closer to 198, but they moved away 1 more then 88, and are still the farthest


3 guesses per person, you can guess one at a time. You CAN guess the same number as the others, but you CANNOT use the same numbers someone else did. Example:

If BoofyMcBoof uses 4,15,23

and 
AnalMcAdams uses 62, 123, 199

And you:

SourSmegma wants  can use [4, 15, 100] or [62, 123, 15] but not direct copies.


I've screencaptered the numbers so no one can say I changed them ahead of time for lulz (which is something I would totally do).

IF someone mentions one of the demon numbers, that number will be announced, and naturally, you can only guess 2 numbers, then 1.


**TLDR: The point of this one is to be as precisely inaccurate as one can be. You lose by guessing any of the 3 numbers, and they will make you mad. To cure this madness, you must say a positive compliment to every poster above you. Upon doing so, your curse will fade, Cthullu will be lulled, and you will find the hidden Treasure of Consolation, 1 fent test kit.***


There are no second, or runner ups this time. Contest will run till about the time I wake up tomorrow (this time, whatever its now, noon eastern). 5 strips to the winner. (8 strips given away total, planning to order far more next week!).


Eventually, my goal is to have enough money  to just give these fents away to anyone who PMs me, so if you REALLY need a fent test kit and can't afford it, something will be done. (DON'T DO THIS NOW, I R NOT A MONIES YET, I really don't have the means to operating something like that). 


Let this experiment into the insanity begin! (Sorry for those waiting till around 11-midnight tonight, as I said last week, I run on Lana time, and Lana time is NOW). 

I'll check periducaly, but I feel I'm gonna have to lots of maths to figure out who wins, so I'll have to lock it tomorrow morning when I wake up, if I havn't calculated the closest.

Tap tap tap tap....
Impatiently waiting,
patiently fading
In every sense of the word
However unheard
Starving off life until death 
Your shallow breath beneath your chest 
Collapsed veins, endocarditis, abscess 
The decorations of your disease 
As if infected with all your mumbled pleas.

Thump thump thump....
you feel your heart about to shatter your rib cage 
Even though you‚Äôve been here since a young age
It didn‚Äôt start out like this
But Eventually you became addicted to deaths kiss
Down to the underworld you crawled
To get to this place you did not fall.

Ahhhhhhh....
Relief, if only just momentary
You can tell yourself it isn‚Äôt monetary 
Nothing in this life is free
You know you were just on your knees 
Sucking dicks for a fix
Showing your tits for a hit
Shit, this got serious quick
You sold your dignity for a price
There‚Äôs just some things you can‚Äôt get back in life.

.........
Silence
Your favorite sound
What you would imagine it‚Äôs like underground
Minus the maggots chewing your decaying flesh 
A sick mind ticked into thinking it‚Äôs their best bet
That is the nature of the beast 
On your hopes and love it will feast 
Until there is nothing left to take
Unless there‚Äôs a new victim at your wake.

It was my usual ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù that awakened me from an uneasy sleep: The early pangs of opiate withdrawal. Restless legs. Vivid dreams during the rare few minutes of REM sleep that actually found me. Hot/cold sweats. Severe anxiety. It‚Äôs impossible to truly be comfortable while being dopesick. It was the anxiety that bothered me the most that morning. I had an afternoon shift at the bar where I was employed and I knew there was absolutely no way I could work while being two days into dopesickness. At that point in my addiction, I could fake being well during the first day, but the second day wasn‚Äôt so easy. My addiction was obviously a secret from most of the people I worked with and I had to keep it that way. I looked at my wallet and pulled out my last $50, wondering if spending it on drugs and feeling normal for a few hours was worth not eating. I don‚Äôt know why I even pretended to myself that I would ever choose food. 

With my mind made up, I picked up my phone and sent the usual text to my usual people. ‚ÄúYou know anything?‚Äù It was early in the morning, so I didn‚Äôt expect to receive a response as quickly as I did, but a response I did receive in less than a minute. 

It was from another addict who‚Äôs nickname was ‚ÄúNoble.‚Äù According to him, he earned the nickname because of how well he treated the people he dealt with but so far I had had the opposite experience. He was the type of person you could tell had once had a good head resting on his shoulders. Remnants of lost intelligence. Years of hard intravenous drug use had changed that, however. I‚Äôd met him in trying to procure suboxone strips, of which he got once a month from a doctor, but his body betrayed his true drug of choice. Crystal methamphetamine. Noble was about my height, around six foot, but easily 30 pounds lighter. His head looked like a bug-eyed skull tacked on to an emaciated corpse. He reminded me of the dead eyed holocaust victims you see in old World War II movies and documentaries. His cold blue eyes were always opened wide and glassy, constantly darting around, looking at his surroundings but not truly seeing what was there. 

‚ÄúYeah man, I know where something is. ABG morphine 60s. But they‚Äôre $25 apiece...and I need you to buy me one. I‚Äôll get you back with a strip on the first but me and my girl need to get well.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck‚Äù was all I could think as i repeatedly read his response. I looked back at my last $50, painfully aware that one morphine 60 wouldn‚Äôt even make me well with my current habit. I usually ate 180 milligrams of morphine just to catch a nod... 60 milligrams orally would keep me from puking at best. 

‚ÄúI have $50 but one isn‚Äôt enough for me...it wouldn‚Äôt even be worth the drive out there‚Äù I texted back. 

‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôd finally do it right, it would keep you well all day.‚Äù He responded. By ‚Äúdo it right‚Äù he meant break the pill down into a solution with heat and water and inject it intravenously. Shoot it up. Something this guy has hinted I should do before. ‚ÄúEating them is just such a waste, man. It breaks my junkie heart.‚Äù Yes, I was addicted to pain pills. Yes, I ate them every day. Yes, my tolerance was ridiculously out of control. But shooting up was a line I‚Äôd always told myself I would never, under no circumstances, ever cross. It was as if not using a needle separated me from the ‚Äúreal‚Äù junkies. If I finally shot up, it would somehow make my addiction a serious problem instead of just a bad habit. Of course I was lying to myself and deep down I knew that I was already a junky, but at least I could still say I had never shot up. 

I didn‚Äôt respond immediately. I waited half an hour, hoping that someone else would come through. Checking my phone every thirty seconds...mindful of the time slowly running out for me to be able to get that (essentially) $50 pill and be back in time for work. He texted me again, ‚Äúso what‚Äôs up?.‚Äù The withdrawals had started to feel worse from the moment I found out I could possibly get that sweet, sweet relief, as they tend to do. I was mentally talking myself into getting the pill... the angel on my shoulder telling me I could go get the pill, eat it, and make it through the upcoming shift...not quite well but not throwing up every time I smelled food cooking either. The devil on the other shoulder sat there quietly...the both of us knowing what he wanted me to do without need of an argument. The both of us already aware that he had already won this silent exchange. I grabbed my keys and texted Noble ‚ÄúOMW.‚Äù

As I was driving down the highway, I thought about how my choices had lead to this situation. Me, in my early 20s, decent looking, a smart veteran student breezing through school on my Post 9/11 GI Bill and slowly losing control to a pill addiction that I refused to admit was truly serious. At this point I‚Äôd been an addict for two years. My active duty contract had ended in April 2013 and I moved back to my hometown for school. I‚Äôd been stationed in California and while I loved it there and truly would have been happy staying, school was much cheaper in my home state. Plus my family, whom I‚Äôd neglected my whole enlistment, were all in Mississippi. But I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúfit in‚Äù in my home state. I was covered in tattoos that weren‚Äôt done in ‚Äúuncle scooters tool shed‚Äù...they were full color and done by a professional with good ink and packed in with a tattoo machine, not shoplifted Indian ink amateurishly packed by a tattoo ‚Äúgun.‚Äù I hated country music and most rap (I love a lot of rap now though, oddly enough). I especially hated the awful mix of the two genres that was becoming increasingly popular around here. My high school sweetheart and I were not married with 3 kids like 70 percent of the kids I graduated with. I didn‚Äôt like to drink shitty light beer in a field around a bonfire every other night. Not that there‚Äôs anything inherently wrong with any of that (except the scratched tattoos, for sure. Don‚Äôt fucking do that), it just wasn‚Äôt me. I was bored. I regretted moving back during these few months before classes started. 

My mother, being a severe addict herself, had handed me a handful of hydrocodone on one of those boring nights and I‚Äôd fell in love. They made me feel ‚Äú10 foot tall and bullet proof‚Äù in a way that being a Marine never truly made me feel. They ‚Äúturned all my bad feelings into good feelings.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think about how lonely I felt in California while all my high school friends were in college having fun and how they were bored of it by the time I moved back. I didn‚Äôt think about how fucked my self-esteem was because of the 5 years of abuse I endured at the hands of my step mother (a story fit for a novel itself). I didn‚Äôt think about how hurt I was that my ‚Äúhigh school sweet heart‚Äù didn‚Äôt come running back to me the second I got home like I always came running back to her (figuratively thanks to the distance) throughout my enlistment. Like she and I always planned. None of that shit mattered. It was just me and that amazing, warm euphoria. 

All of that to say...I fucking loved opiates. I was fresh out of the Marines with thousands in my bank account in a state with enough pill prescriptions for each man, woman, and child to have 5 pills a day all year (citation needed). I bought them up at every chance I got. I talked my mom into giving me a substantial amount of hers. I was high for months. I didn‚Äôt even realize I was addicted...I had no concept of what that truly meant. Hell, the first time I‚Äôd went through withdrawals I never even realized that‚Äôs what it was. It never even crossed my mind as a possibility. I spent the next two years in this opiate-induced stupor, nodding my way through college, somehow managing a decent GPA. Further neglecting my family. Not caring about the beautiful pretty young things trying to make a boyfriend out of me, something I pined for while alone in California thinking about my ‚Äúhigh school sweetheart‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt care less about now. I was oblivious to anything that wasn‚Äôt related to pain pills. 

Two years. By this time, even though I was in denial about the seriousness of it all, I had been addicted for two years. The people that truly mattered to me... the people I still gave enough of a shit about to make an effort to keep in my life... knew about my addiction and were worried about me. One of these friends in particular had experience with opiate addiction herself and knew that I had a long, tough road ahead of me. But of course, ‚Äúshe didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about. I‚Äôm different, I‚Äôm strong, I can stop whenever I want to.‚Äù All or this is what was going through my mind as I drove towards that line I promised myself I would never cross. I guess a part of me honestly believed I was driving to just take a peak at the line, to gaze over the edge into the abyss, but not to actually take the plunge. Ascend to the next level of junkiedom. I remember sitting there, driving along and lying to myself and ‚ÄúDown in a Hole‚Äù came up on my playlist. Hearing Layne Staley belt ‚Äúdown in a hole and I don‚Äôt know if I can be saved‚Äù was too much for me to listen to and I had to turn it off.

The drive took over an hour. Somehow my area of the country had been spared by the opiate epidemic currently ravaging the rest of the country and it wasn‚Äôt unusual to drive that far for pills. You‚Äôd need to drive even further for heroin...it just wasn‚Äôt around. I pulled up to Noble‚Äôs house and out he walked with his ‚Äúbaby momma‚Äù trailing behind... a half white, half black toddler that was very obviously not Noble‚Äôs on her hip. Meth was also very obviously her drug of choice. I had known her in high school, not even a decade ago, but even at that current distance from my car to their front door it was obvious the years had not been kind to her. She had the same wide open, darting, glassy eyes as Noble. Her teeth were yellow and lips chapped and cracking. Sores from meth-fueled picking dotted her face amongst ordinary acne. Tangled, damaged blonde hair. She was skinny, but somehow looked fat at the same time. I was immediately reminded of a character from a show I watched that went as a ‚Äúsumo wrestler after he lost the weight‚Äù for Halloween. Her body wasn‚Äôt quite that extreme, but the skin and fat clung loosely to her bones. When she got to my car, she acted as though we hadn‚Äôt seen each other in years even though I‚Äôd seen her not even a week ago. In her defense, she had been drooling all over herself after taking two Xanax bars that day, so I guess remembering me would be too much to ask. 

There was another person walking toward the car that I didn‚Äôt know. He was short...about five foot tall. He wasn‚Äôt as emaciated as Noble and his ‚Äúbaby momma‚Äù but it was still obvious that he ‚Äúdabbled‚Äù in using amphetamines. He was wearing sandals that showcased his dirty toes and crusty nails, an even more filthy pair of white (I think they should have been white) cargo shorts that had brown blood stains on top of the thigh, and a blue tank top covered in specks of paint. His shoulder had one of those shitty home-made ‚Äútattoos‚Äù that I mentioned despising, and underneath it was a large pit of a scar. At the time I didn‚Äôt realize it, but looking back it was obviously remnants of an abscess from missing a shot. 

‚ÄúHey this is [Name withheld because I don‚Äôt want to piss these people off in the off chance they actually read anything], he‚Äôs straight, I‚Äôve known him awhile. He‚Äôs sick too and I told him it was cool to tag along. Is that cool?‚Äù Noble did this purposefully. He knew I was sick, knew that at this point I would agree to anything to get to that pill. Knew that I would agree to stuffing my car full of more people than I had seats. ‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs get going,‚Äù I said without revealing my disapproval in my voice.

‚ÄúThanks man, I‚Äôm sure you know how it is...I appreciate it,‚Äù said [REDACTED] as he hopped into my back seat with Baby Momma and Obviously Not Noble‚Äôs Toddler. 

We drove along, me trying to ignore the dumb junkie meth head bullshit my party was talking about that I was totally still above. Noble asked me to slowdown at one point, assuring that the pills weren‚Äôt going anywhere. I was running out of time and acutely aware of how meth heads like to promise they know how to find exactly what you want, knowing full well they‚Äôre lying in order to get a free ride to get to a gram of shard. [REDACTED] had a voice that sounded like a frog was nesting in his throat in place of an Adam‚Äôs Apple. Maybe it was the withdrawals, maybe it was the nervousness of knowing The Line was inching ever nearer, but every single thing about these people annoyed the ever-living fuck out of me. Their feint smell of body odor, their shitty choice of music playing through my AUX cable (Limp Bizkit...seriously?). The poor kid crying in the back seat, probably hungry or wet. What had I gotten myself in to? 

15 minutes later, we finally arrived at the location of the pills. A trailer surrounded by red dirt, pine trees, rusted immobile cars, and burn piles full of blackened beer cans. Inside lived a man dying of a liver disease I‚Äôve forgotten the name of and his red headed, meth-eyed adult son. The poor guy could barely walk. He seemed happy to see my passengers, surprising me that anyone could be happy to see such shitty people. Me still oblivious to the fact that I was just like them. Well, almost. I haven‚Äôt crossed the line yet. But it is coming. 

I hand Noble the $50 and he goes to the back room with Dying Man. He claims Dying Man doesn‚Äôt like to ‚Äúdo business‚Äù in front of strangers but it was probably because I was getting ripped off over the price of the pills. They come back to the kitchen, one of those cheap 70s mobile home kitchens with particle board cabinets and a decrepit counter jutting from the wall, establishing the boundary between the kitchen and living room. Noble shows me the pills and asks the rhetorical question: ‚ÄúAre you shooting yours?‚Äù The withdrawals are in full swing at this point, whether it‚Äôs all in my head or truly that bad I can never really tell right before I know I‚Äôm about to get well. I give the expected answer. The angel on my shoulder weeps and flutters away, never to be seen again. 

Noble goes to the kitchen and gets to work fixing the shots as I make my way to the living room couch. I sit and look around the room. There isn‚Äôt much...another chair and a box TV accompanied by a cheap DVD player and sporadically placed discs. There‚Äôs nothing of real value anywhere in sight. A true drug addict house. Baby Momma makes her way towards the couch and sits entirely too close to me. 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a minute, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She asks me. No, it hasn‚Äôt, I think to myself. Not nearly long enough. 

‚ÄúYeah it has. I see you have another kid?‚Äù I say inquisitively. 

‚ÄúOh yeah...this is Stormy Grace. My third...I have another you ain‚Äôt seen. I assure you she was a mistake,‚Äù she said rather harshly. But I knew what she was getting at... as I said before, the child obviously had a black father. Baby Momma was ashamed. ‚ÄúYou know, back in school I woulda never fucked no nigger. But I was at a party one night and her daddy drugged my drink and raped me. I don‚Äôt even remember it...I wasn‚Äôt sure it even happened until I failed that pregnancy test‚Äù she explained in her exceptionally thick southern drawl. I was thankful Stormy wasn‚Äôt old enough to hear the insane bullshit currently coming out of her ‚Äúmother‚Äôs‚Äù disgusting, cracked and yellow mouth. Her tongue had a white film covering most of it. I suddenly had a sick taste in my mouth. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up, [My Last Name],‚Äù declared Noble. People always call me by my last name for some reason. ‚ÄúJust stay right there,‚Äù he continued as he walked towards the couch with a loaded syringe. Letting someone else make my shot is something I would never do later on in my addiction, but that day was a learning experience. He held out an old leather belt towards me. ‚ÄúWrap that around your upper arm, strap going away from you.‚Äù I did as I was instructed. The belt cinched around my upper arm and my veins began to bulge and pulse as I clenched and unclenched my fist. It almost felt like I was at a routine doctors appointment, about to draw blood for tests. Almost. 

‚ÄúDamn son, you got some monster veins‚Äù proclaimed [REDACTED]. ‚ÄúYou could park a fire truck in those fuckers.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThis is his first time,‚Äù Noble told him as he flicked the syringe, watching the bubble of air float up towards the needle and pushing the plunger up to release the excess air. He squatted down on one knee, moving closer to my outstretched arm. 

[REDACTED] has a look on his face that shows he obviously didn‚Äôt know I had virgin veins. ‚ÄúMan, you sure about this?‚Äù He asked me in his froggy voice. ‚ÄúThis is the next level. After this, eating em just won‚Äôt cut it. You think being dopesick is bad now, just wait and see what it‚Äôs like after a healthy IV habit.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been addicted for years...I can eat 180 milligrams of morphine at a time...100 milligrams of oxycodone...I mean, I get sick off all the Tylenol before I even get well from eating those pills. This has been a long time coming. If I didn‚Äôt go through with this now, it‚Äôd be just a matter of time before I did it with someone else anyway.‚Äù I was rationalizing this idiotic decision to myself as much as I was to him. 

‚ÄúAlright man...it‚Äôs your life.‚Äù said the Frog Man. 

‚ÄúHere it goes...‚Äù Noble found the big ropy vein in the crook of my arm and slid the long needle through the skin. I felt it pop into the vein, saw the quick spurt of blood shoot into the syringe as Noble pulled the plunger back to make sure he‚Äôd hit his mark. He pushed the plunger all the way forward quickly, much more quickly than a nurse or doctor would do. ‚ÄúLet the belt go,‚Äù he instructed and I abided. 

‚ÄúMother fucka you are HIGH‚Äù croaked the Frog Man.

But I wasn‚Äôt. Not yet. It wasn‚Äôt like the movies, where the actor‚Äôs eyes roll into the back of his head before the belt is even loose. It took awhile, long enough for me to question if 60 milligrams was enough or if Noble had stolen my pill. But just as those doubts were getting comfortable in my mind, the morphine molecules pushed the doubts away as they attached themselves to the receptors in my brain. I felt it first in my legs. They felt like they had magically become one hundred pounds heavier. Then it moved to my chest...the cheap tile pulling my torso towards the floor like a strong magnet. Next were what my addict friends and I call ‚Äúpins and needles.‚Äù With a good morphine shot, you feel it inside your colon first. Yes, needles in your asshole. And you enjoy it. Then it started in my head and moved down my shoulders and arms. My teeth felt as if they were about to shatter. I had become extremely hot, my face as red as the tattooed flowers on my arm. Most importantly, I was no longer dopesick. No more stomach pain, no more sweating while simultaneously freezing. No more anxiety. Not even any guilt over crossing the line so easily. 

‚ÄúDaaamn...that was a good un...your face is red as fuck!‚Äù exclaimed Baby Momma as she handed me Stormy. ‚ÄúMy turn.‚Äù Noble took the other loaded rig out from behind his ear, the doctor of this appointment pulling out his pen to write her a prescription for euphoria, and administered the shot. ‚ÄúI hope you don‚Äôt think less of me,‚Äù she said lazily to me as the hit took effect. I wondered why she thought I‚Äôd think less of her after doing something I‚Äôd just done myself. Then I realized she was talking about Stormy. I already assumed that the rape story was a lie... that in reality she‚Äôd let her drug dealer fuck her raw and cum inside her in exchange for half a gram of meth. I remember thinking how fucked up it was that she was more ashamed of fucking a black dude instead of the years of drug abuse. Good ole Mississippi. And they say racism is dead. She stood up and dropped her needle into the cheap tile floor. The Red Head Meth Head, who I had forgotten was lurking in a corner, stared at Baby Momma‚Äôs flabby skinny-fat ass as she bent over to retrieve her rig. ‚ÄúWhoops,‚Äù she said as I snapped out of the pleasure dream from the shot and became keenly aware of where I was. A wave of shame crashed over me along with a sudden urge to run to my car and speed away.

‚ÄúAlright man, it‚Äôs time to go,‚Äù I announced to no one in particular. ‚ÄúI have to work in about two hours and I still have to drive you guys back and make that hour drive.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAlright, lets go then. [REDACTED], cmon we gotta go. Thanks (Dying Man) for letting us make ourselves at home.‚Äù I guess even meth heads practice Southern Hospitality. 

45 minutes later, the meth heads (I keep saying that...they were more like ‚Äòtable‚Äô junkies...they‚Äôd do whatever was on the table. Meth was just more prevalent in our area) long dropped off at their house, me driving along to work. Layne Staley singing ‚Äúlook at a man who won‚Äôt let himself be,‚Äù the song no longer bothering me. I‚Äôd crossed that line. I had ascended to the next level. I had done what I‚Äôd promised myself I‚Äôd never do. I was well, however, and I stayed well for about 24 hours. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt that bad,‚Äù I thought to myself. I didn‚Äôt grasp that I‚Äôd just took the first step down a path of true pain, true heartache, true loneliness. I had jumped into that abyss head first. 

‚ÄúDown in a hole...losing my soul,‚Äù Layne and Jerry harmonizing the anthem of my addiction.

tl;dr daughter got really interested in the opioid crisis and researches the dangers of continuous opioid use and she loves talking to my family and I about it. Recently I have noticed signs that she might be using. Many more key details in full post.

Hi everyone. I just decided to create a reddit account because I feel that you all could be helpful in figuring out some things about my daughter. Any advice or thoughts are greatly appreciated so thank you in advance :)

I would like to quickly add that I am not the type of parent to be close minded that all drug use is inherently evil just because it is a drug. I have no problem with certain drugs such as marijuana or some psychedelics. Of course, I would prefer if my children would not do it. 

Here is the situation: I am the mother of 2 boys (22 and 19) and 1 girl (16 years old). My daughter has recently (past few months) taken a huge interest in the opioid crisis. She is one to research for hours on end about something she is interested in. She has no problem talking to my husband or I about it. She is generally a pretty closed off person and is very independent, but she loves talking to us about her new research topics and she loves to inform us and hear our opinions on it. I know every parent would say this, but she is so not the type to do drugs. She is very committed to school, she is very spiritual, she has many goals, and she knows what excessive drug use can do to a person. As far as I know, she has never drank, smoked, or done anything drug related.

When she first started talking about the opioid crisis to us, I was initially a little bit worried because she is such a curious person, so I decided to research signs of opioid use.

Over these past 30 days, she never hesitates to mention when speaking with us how bad continuous opioid use is harmful for the neurons in your brain and how she would never do them. She always mentions how she believes people get addicted and dependent because they are ignorant on how the drug works and how easily it is to get addicted. She says that the doctors need to inform patients better or people need to educate themselves like she is doing. She also likes to joke around with her brothers because they always mention how they could easily see her doing opioids because she talks about them so much. She has gotten super offended when she learned that one of her brothers was actually serious when he said that he could see her taking them.

Anyway, on to why I am writing this post in the first place. Since I researched how to recognize signs of opioid use, I have been more attentive to her actions and her looks. In the past two weeks, I have noticed some days where she is super tired and she does what you would call ""nodding"" occasionally. She also gets really happy sometimes. She is generally a super happy girl, so this might not be anything special. But what drove me to write this post was something that I saw tonight. She wasn't tired at all, she was energetic and super happy, but her pupils were completely pinpoint, even in the dark. Another thing, she also has recently been getting anxiety, which she hasn't really had before.

If you think she is using, how should I approach this situation? I don't know how to react if she is using. I don't want to get mad because I understand she is a curious girl. I would just be in shock and I would have no clue on how to approach talking to her about it.

I would love to hear your thoughts. Again, anything is appreciated! Thank you and have a great day.

He was probably known to most as the guy who stacked stones on Belle Isle but he was also an inspired writer, photographer, as well as a dedicated harm reduction activist. 

He experienced some harrowing tragedies during his time as a homeless junkie, some poignant moments as well, and he wrote a lot of them down. You can read them by following the link below.  

I became an addict in part due to my curiosity which was piqued by artists who were addicts and people like Mathew Loflin Davis have always inspired me so I feel obligated to share his story and keep his memory alive.

1. The time I was in withdrawls and got hit by a car doing 40 mph. Jumped into the windshield and was sick in the hospital getting wounds flushed stitched and skin cut off untill the 3rd morphine shot. Took six weeks to get all the glass out of my back.

2. Getting sent to a mental ward by the police after they made me climb down out of a tree. Hospital staff stole my shoes then discharged me shoeless in Brooklyn after I got high in the bathroom. Blacked out and woke up on a bench outside the projects. Sunglasses and keys gone but wallet still there. Wierd. Couldnt find my car for 4 days. Amphetamine psychosis was my diagnosis. Laaaaaame.

3. Shitting myself at my moms house in front of her. Super lame.

The hondos on the corner always had fire tar and fire crack. Well now i live on the opposite side of the country and there are open air markets near me, and when i say near, i mean like 3 hours bus/train 1.5 hours driving...that is if i found a ride. So going to ""the city"" or anything like is no longer an option. Especially since i dont drive anymore (got my license suspended for 3 years). It is borderline impossible to find dope around my area, or pills for that matter.  
So, since i had already been quite familiar with the DN...i decided to order a few weeks ago. Ordered a half gram of BTH with overnight express shipping. Paid $60 for the half, and $35 for the shipping (outrageous i know, but im desperate) It got here in 36 hours and weighed 0.95g. I was stoked. Stayed high for a few days. I then decided to order another half gram, but also ordered a half gram of some fishscale the vendor offers...because, well because speedball. A week has gone by and no package...im pissed, opened a dispute to get my money back but that takes a week at least. So i placed another thursday morning since i had a bad feeling about the BTH and coke and bam today i get blessed with some firrrrre ECP...  
  
I hate not having connects i had meet locally...but maybe one day ill meet them. Or maybe it's a good thing and that is what is allowing me to only use a few times a month, sometimes none

My experience,"A couple of people have asked me to post this here, so i am. Please note I am not a doctor or expert.  Below is my experience, but I was amazed that i was able to kick H with one 8mg Suboxone strip.  I learned this method from others on this sub, so i have them to thank a million times for this.

I recently went on a 3 week run with heroin. I know it doesn't sound long, but it was IV use and I was taking 3-4 shots per day. Also, the people who taught me this used the same method to kick much larger/longer habits. I did it with one 8mg sub, but if you had two it might be better.

First, you need to wait at least 24 hours after you last use Heroin/Oxy use before taking the sub or you go into precipitated withdrawal, which sounds like complete hell. It actually has more to do with how you're feeling than the time, but I've been told 24 hrs is pretty safe.  If you're not familiar with precipitated withdrawal, google it. Also google COWS worksheet to test how far into withdrawal you are.  Basically you need the full agonist (heroin) out of your system before taking the sub. So you will have to deal with being sick for part of a day.

Once you're ready to induce, take the smallest amount needed to make you well. Take the 8mg strip and cut it into 8 equal slivers. Take one or two of those slivers and cut them in half. So you have a few .5mg slivers. Take one under the tongue and wait half hour. if nothing, take another, etc until you feel well. This part was a little stressful for me. Once i took the first bit i swear i felt worse so thought i was going into precipitated wd, but i wasnt. It took 2 mg to get me well that day. subs is a strong drug and you dont need as much as people think. so here was my daily use day by day:

2mg 1mg 1mg 1mg 1mg .5mg .5mg .5mg .25mg .25mg

I'm not saying I felt 100% well the whole time. But i would say i felt an average of 80% well throughout. Sometimes better sometimes worse.  When i dropped doses i felt it a bit, but it was manageable. I went to work everyday and participated in family events.  The worst day for me was the first day totally off the sub. but now I'm 3 days off and actually feel great. Also, i had ""comfort meds"" to help me on days when i felt kinda bad. these were xanax and pregabalin (lyrica).

If your use was heavier than mine, and if you have more subs, you might stretch it out a bit longer. But the idea is to get off quickly before you really get addicted to the subs.

I always went cold turkey before, but this method was really advantageous, particularly if you need to continue living your life while kicking.  Biggest potential drawback is that it relatively painless and relatively quick, so potential for relapse is high.  

I'm sure there are many opinions and other experiences about this, like I said I'm no expert.  but it totally worked for me.  I'm happy to answer any more questions if i can.  ",1520728875.0

Never got scripted by a doctor.. Only went to a clinic once and said fuck it not for me...

A close friend of mine gets strips and sells them.

My brother who I bought a house with gets subutex every month and had been giving them to me...
At first he got the orange ones.. One pill I could make last a week at least snorting small lines in the morning.. At lunch and at night..
This went on for awhile..

Then he got a different pill.. The fucking small 8ball subs all the sudden the lines I was snorting were stronger much stronger..
Before I know it a pill is lasting me two days..
And then it becomes a problem because he is running out of his medicine at the end of the month just trying to keep me and him from getting sick..

Now during this time I also would have moments where I'd take breaks and snort dilaudid.. Get a script for hydrocodone every month that I just sell..

Anyways after a year and a half of this he decided he wasn't going to give them to mee anymore..
I never was the type of addict to sell my stuff or let my life get out of control.
He basically put me on subs because we were getting a house together and he and his wife are both recovering addicts with a kid and he didn't want me bringing any kind of dope in the house I cant even have beer and stuff here. Working on finding a room to rent somewhere else right now..
But back to my original question....

I been off subs for two week..
I waited one week or a little less and got some dilaudid spent a week snorting about 16mg a day.. Didn't feel shit.. Got my hydro script...week 2 off subs.. Took 10.. 10s for a few days didn't feel shit..
The past few days I've only taken maybe 2 or 3 a day combined with gabapentin and Valium which I have a ton of both.. I'm down to my last 5mg of hydrocodone.. I've only taken 20mg combined today and that's about what i took yesterday too.. I expected to be sick by now but I think ice weaned myself off decently..
Tomorrow will be the first day with nothing..
Well.. I do have two tramadol but they might be gone before the nights over..

But shit I expected to get a feeling both times being it had been a week then two weeks off subs.

Those 8ball subs really fucked me.

When can I get high again? I feel like if I went and bought a roxie 30 tonight I might... But I don't want to risk it..
I just don't understand why i can't get high anymore.

Before subs I could make a roxie 30 last me a day... I was never that bad..

Now I'm considering snorting or smoking H for the first time just cause I want to get high again.

Even tho sub has saved my family members lives..

Long story, TL;DR

I know not many of y‚Äôall know me, but I been here for a while lurking and recently making post. Just need to rant.

So if y‚Äôall saw my post last night I was insanely fucked up and wanting to die, but luckily I made it back to my motel room, which I lose on Monday. 

Anyway I‚Äôve been fooling around with this girl and last night she stole from me. I buy her food everyday, Roxie‚Äôs everyday, and drive her like a taxi. I rarely ever get any puss from her either. By no mean am I rich or have ever been rich. So not only am I financially unstable from my habit I‚Äôm now homless because of her. 

So back to the story, we had been doing 30s all day long and I usually don‚Äôt nod unless I shoot like 3 at once. Well yesterday I had went and gotten 2 Roxie‚Äôs for me and 2 for her at lunch time. Then I get call from a Friend of mine saying he wants me to middle. So I go pick him up and I get two more and her two more and my other boy and his wife 5. Well as we‚Äôre waiting for my dude to roll up, my girl pulls out like 30 xans and hands me 8. Me being a fucking idiot I take all 8.

So I thought cool I might get alittle high. Well next thing I know the person riding with that I‚Äôm middling for also hands me another 30 and 6 more xans after my dude showed up(all xan mentioned are .5).

Well I take those 6 xans as well because I wasn‚Äôt feeling the ones I took hours ago. So I shoot my 30 that was given to me and next thing I know I‚Äôm lights out cold. I wake up couple mins later and my girl is just straight gone and the husband to the girl I am middling for is sitting in the seat beside me where my girl was sitting. He woke me up and tells me she just got out of the car and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt fucking do this!‚Äù and straight left. She also got 130$ that was in my cup holder. Now every time I try to call her my number goes to voicemail and I have no way to get in touch with her. 

Why do the shitting things happen to good people? I mean I know I‚Äôm not a good person by any means, and no one is for that matter. But I‚Äôve always been a caretaker of the ones I care about. My mother always told me that if someone was hungry to feed them and always do for other when you are able. Not sure if that really applies to this situation by you get the gist. 

So this morning, well afternoon I wake up and see I have 40$ in my wallet. No gas cigs or food. But of course getting high always comes first. So I call everyone of my connects for roxys and nobody has it. I call everyone for h and nobody has it. Well I had forgotten about one last guy I get 30s from and go to his house. He is also out, but this well know hooker is there. She tells me she has ‚Äúice cream‚Äù if I want some. I told her I‚Äôve smoked it in the past and snorted and eaten it but I‚Äôve never shot it.(anyone who shoots up knows once you shoot up once you will never do another drug a different way.) So me being desperate and wanting to get high I buy a 20 bag and do half of it. 

Oh My God. I am going a mile a minute. The rush was so fucking intense and I can‚Äôt stop moving. I know this is an opiate sub but I thought I would share the crazy story.

Also question for you meff guys out there. Does it help with your opiate withdrawals? The hooker I got it from says that i shouldn‚Äôt have withdrawals at all. 

TL;DR nodded out, girl left me, stole my money, I‚Äôm high on meth now. Fuck itü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But what's virtually never included in any of this is potentiation **instructions**. 

The two main ones I'm using are grapefruit juice and agmatine, and so for brevity I suppose this post will just involve these. What I'd like to know is, A., how much one should be taking to induce peak potentiation, and most importantly, B., the dose scheduling AKA the timing of potentiation. WHEN and HOW MANY TIMES do you use the potentiators? Do you take it:

* before dosing (how long before)

* when you dose

* after the dose kicks in

and do you repeatedly take it? 

Alright so it's just this: long story short, what are the exact instructions for exactly how much, when, and how often one is supposed to use the potentiator? I'm tired of having no idea if I'm wasting my potentiators or not or if there's just a way better way I should be doing it. Again, I'm seeking answers for grapefruit juice and agmatine. Unless there's another one that you swear by as being better (that is easily available and not sketchy), then I'd like to hear about that too. 

If it at all matters my drug is methadone.",1520707687.0

---

No one in my family knows I use dope. My success at keeping the secret is due to what I've termed my ""dope bubble"". I use my dope bubble to keep up the charade. The rules of the dope bubble are: 1. Don't go on benders 2. Don't let anyone into my apartment 3. Only see non-user friends and family if you're well but not high. 4. Don't let your guard down. Be vigilant about what you say and how you say it. This is the story about the day I broke all these rules.

I did my morning shot but it didn't touch my withdrawals. I guess what I saved was the antithesis of a hot spot. Still sick I started texting whoever I could. Then my sickness started to turn into something different, something new. I realize now it was cotton fever but I didn't know it at the time. I'd never had cotton fever before. I crawled to my bed and buried myself under the sheets, this was the end.

My heart was pounding out of my chest so vigorously I didn't realize there was also a pounding on my door. I feebly dragged myself to the front and could hear my moms voice. ""Peter! Peter, open the door!"" I wasn't going to open the door, not like this. I sat beside it waiting for her to go away. ""PETER!"" She started sobbing. I started to think it was an emergency. My mom never visited me unannounced, and she never pounded on my door. Against my better judgment I stood up and turned the lock. The door swung open and I instantly regretted it, my mom fell into my dope bubble.

""Peter you're alive!"", ""Where have you been, you had us all worried"", ""I love you so much"", ""Dave said you haven't been to work"", ""I thought I was going to have to report you missing"". . . I typically visit my parents every week. I didn't visit last week because I was sick. The week before I was starting a new job. I was wearing a t-shirt the last time I saw my family. I had my winter coat out now. How long has it been? I remember reading a text from my mom. I nodded out before I could respond. Did I ever respond? Did I read the last text she sent?

My mom stopped talking and the silence broke my train of thought. I needed to stop shaking. I needed to act normal. She looked me up and down and I knew I couldn't hide it. ""Are you O.K?"". I should have said I was sick with the flu. That would explain why I hadn't answered their messages. That would give me an excuse to make her leave. What came out of my mouth instead was incoherent mumbles and the word ""sick"". Perhaps it was the most honest answer I ever gave her. She grabbed my hand and started leading me to the door, ""I'm taking you to the doctor, you don't look good"". I followed because I wanted to look normal, and that's what a normal person would do if they were this sick, right? It's hard to act normal when you don't know what normal is anymore.

My moms car smelled like my moms car. It was the same car she drove my siblings and I to highschool in. The same car I learned to drive in. I laid down in the backseat. The shaking stopped but I still felt sick and weak. I started thinking about the smell of my moms car, my parents reporting me missing, my mom falling into my dope bubble. I could feel my facade of sobriety collapsing around me, I could hear a ringing in my ears, and I started crying. Not gentle crying but violent, viseral, sobs. The kind of cry where your snot sticks your face to the car seat. My mom reached back and patted my shoulder ""It's ok hunnie"", it made me cry more.

My phone vibrated in my pocket and I remembered the messages I sent earlier. I opened the text, ""30 minutes good?"". This will fix everything. ""Mom I'm feeling better, I forgot I need to go to work"", ""I really think you should see the doctor"", ""I'll go after work, I really need you to take me to work"", ""Peter, it's Sunday"", ""Mom let me out!"", ""You're still in your pajamas"", ""LET ME OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR"", ""I'll drop you off at home"".

I mixed up a shot and pushed it into my crippled veins. The sickness melted away to be replaced by a comforting warmth. Everything was a-ok. I was going to fix everything. I would start by sending my mom an apology text. I had an excuse planned. I had a good story. I turned my phone on and caught up to a backlog of texts.

""I made lasagna, your favorite. Come to dinner tonight""

""How are you?""

""Peter your dad and I are worried. Get back to me""

""Peter I'm coming to visit after work today, really worried about you""

""We need to talk""

There was no way to reconstruct the bubble.
