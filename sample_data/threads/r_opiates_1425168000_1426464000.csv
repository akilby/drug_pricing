2xk523,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xk523/quick_missed_shot_question/,8,https://redd.it/2xk523,TakinLosses1,Quick Missed Shot Question,"So I am retarded and accidentally used a very old cotton instead of a new one (like 3 months old) and missed the shot on top of that. Yesterday immediatly after - it swelled up huge like half of a golf ball sticking out of my skin and was red for about 15-20 minutes after, the redness then subsided.

I applied a hot compress a couple times and when I woke up the ""bump"" was gone and all thats left is a little bit of rounded swelling in the area that really isnt painful to the touch- just a tad sore when pressed. There is no redness anymore either.

I've never had an abcess or infection so I was curious if I would know at this point in the game (~10-12 hours after) or if it takes some time to develop and could come back on me. It certainly seems like its going in a positive direction but I'm not sure if infection just hasn't had time to set in yet. 

Also, if it does take some time- when would I expect things to start getting worse (if it is in fact infected)?

Let me start off with, I'm not a daily user, and never have been. And I don't bang my stuff.  I usually use pharms but right now H is what's convenient.  (And I'm a little afraid of what's going to happen when I run out of my supply, longest stretch with H)

I originally wrote a long ass post but figured no body wants to read all this shit, so 

Too long, didn't want to make you read --

 - I got dope that gets me high but also makes me sick.  Don't know if it's specifically this dope or what but diff batch last weekend did similar.  Never got ""This"" kind of sick from any kind of opi 

 - I normally smoke e-cig day to day but normal cigs never made me sick in the past, except for now dope.  I mean when I smoke a cig sometimes I can't even finish the cig I feel so dizzy / about to vomit by the end of it.

 - For some reason I took a shit earlier (sorry TMI) and it made me feel better temporarily but as soon as I did more H, same thing.  I just have this uneasy / slightly nauseated feeling lingering and, when I smoke a cig, hits me like a ton of bricks to the point where I've gagged and nearly puked but never did actually vomit.

 - I keep feeling hungry on the dope but when I eat it gives me a heavy feeling on my stomach with more nausea.  Best I can explain it is it feels like my food isn't digesting.  

I can post the full post I was originally going to write if anyone interested, but it was quite the long ramble and I figured I'd cut it short.   I'm just trying to figure out why this dope is making me sick?   Last weekend I had 1/2 gram that wasn't as strong and didn't make me nearly as sick, but it did make me a bit sick.  And, I got a gram this weekend which seems 10x worse.  But is stronger?

Anyone ever experience this?  It really doesn't feel like the ""I took too much"" sick feeling.  But this dope is stronger and seems to make me more sick than the last?  But hell, I don't even know at this point.

 He was the most intellegent man I've ever known and I'm convinced that he saved my life this one time. Of course we all preached safe using, but we all went on binges, I remember once I took 17 e pills in the span of 24 hours (they were weak pills, but still, the binge was excessive and I'm convinced permanently damaged my serotinin receptors and was partly the cause of the depressing I face to today). Of course his disapproval was something I took seriously, since he had done sooo much research on drugs and their effect on the brain and the body that it would have seemed foolish not fo believe what he said. However we were fucked up teenagers at the time, the fun came first. Once however I'm convinced that his advice saved my life. He always said that we should never listen to a regular opiate users advice on how much to take, since they are so use to their high tolerance dosage that they sometimes forget how much they first started taking and the potential of overdose was high. So one day I scored my first batch of oxy, 3 20mg pills. The guy who sold them to me was a regular user, had a much larger stature than myself and was shooting them up. He told me to take all three (chew 2,and snort the last one about an hour later), it was my first time ever doing opiates. I recalled my friends advice, and decided to take 2 instead of all three. So I chewed my first one and went to class. An hour later nothing was happening (or maybe something was and I was just too eager to see what the big deal so I didnt notice), so I railed the other one. Fast foward 30 minutes later, and my teacher is commenting on how sick I look as I'm puking in the hallway of my school. Fast forward another couple of hours later, and I'm ghost white with blue lips and shivering. I'm fainting as I'm walking around my house and I'm hiding from mom because I don't want her to see her son in the condition I was in. To this day, I'm convinced that if I didn't remember what my friend had taught me and taken that third pill, I wouldn't be here right now. It makes it all the more sad that that same friend died of a suspected heroin overdose about 4 years later. I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I'm really drunk right now and I really realize I owe my life to him. So thanks man, I love you.
Basically, I guess I wanna if you had a friend like that too, someone who knew so much about drugs through his independant research, that I helped you as you went through it, or maybe even saved your life.",1425210335.0

2xjex3,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xjex3/what_is_happiness/,11,https://redd.it/2xjex3,crazyrthendahmer,What is happiness....?,"...I ask myself as I walk into a lonely church with a friend of mine. As I look around I see several older gentleman setting up for what is supposed to be a very special night for the community I choose to be apart of. The exchange of small talk takes place and the feeling of despair is just starting to wash over me. The commitment to help set up an event where over 300 people are supposed to attend is now a realization. As I start to set up tables and chairs the voice in my head starts to say ""service work is how you stay clean and sober"". But how am I supposed to stay clean and sober when I feel this restless and depressed? Whatever, I keep going hoping these thoughts and feelings of sadness will soon exit my mind. 

Finally after setting up for three hours the clock reads six o'clock. People start to enter the dining hall of the church. As I go outside for a cigarette the crowd of familiar faces start to surround me. The greetings and smiles of friendly faces would hope to relieve me of this funk I'm experiencing. Sadly I was wrong. 

It is now 7:30 and the meeting is just starting to take place. The crowd of recovering alcoholics and drug addicts is asked for a moment of a silence followed by the serenity prayer. The crowd and I start to chant, ""God grant me the serrenity...."". The irony of this still baffles me. 16 months ago the word ""GOD"" would not of even been in my vocabulary. Let alone even in my mind. The amount of hate I had for him was even higher than any other man, woman, or thing in this entire world. But now 16 months later I find myself saying his name repetitively in church's and meeting halls on a daily basis. How could this of changed so much over such a small period of time? 

Tonight is the only night out of the year that over 300 people fill this church to capacity. Out of 300 people how is it that I feel I'm the only one in attendance? How is it that out of all the hand shakes, all the hugs given, and all the high fives I still feel like I'm all by myself. Is this happiness?

Finally the night has come to an end. I find myself with the same older gentlemen cleaning up the leftover plates, silverware, and crumbs from the dining hall. The 300 people have all exited the church and I'm still here with the same feeling of loneliness. I ask myself again is this supposed to be happiness. Is happiness supposed to be the feelings of fear, anxiety, and depression every morning I wake up. How do i reach happiness? because the only way I can see myself escaping this, is the needle or *the end*.  

.....I don't know guys. I just felt like writing this after a night like tonight. Sorry if it sucked. Just felt like this would help.

i was raised by people who answered doors and telephones so i got up and opened it.

""Whats up bro?"", said Carl looking over my shoulder into my apartment.  ""Jesus you like shit.""

the noise woke up my roommate Kyle and my girlfriend who squinted like moles in the intrusive sunlight.  

Kyle said ""Who the fuck are you man?!""

without a word Carl walked in, whipped off his shirt and punched Kyle.  my girlfriend screamed and I shut the door because it was a workday and the neighbors already hated us.  Kyle collapsed but started to scramble to get up.

""Stay down!"",  i warned him.  ""Its ok!  Its just my brother Carl.""

""What the fuck?!"",  yelled Kyle holding his bleeding nose.

""Jesus Christ look at you fucking degenerate junkie shit for brain motherfuckers!"", said Carl.  Carl worked construction, surfed and only drank beer.  his tan muscular build made us look like pale freaky aliens.  ""Alright, let go.  Mom's birthday.""

for the past 3 years this was a normal occurrence.  i would forget about mom's birthday and Carl would hunt me down.

""Fuck you!"", screamed my girlfriend.  the look on Carl's face meant he was about to say something rude, sexist and condescending so I slid myself between them.  

""I'm not going!"", I yelled, ""Dwayne never goes!"" 

Dwayne was our older step brother.  he was where I learned about pills and H.  Dwayne had crossed many lines with many relatives and i think i was the only one who still talked to him.

""Fuck Dwayne!  He's probably dead in a fucking ditch.  You're mom's precious little baby boy so lets go!  Now fuckface!""

I glared at Carl even though I knew what was next.  hell, anyone who grew up with brothers probably knows too.  Carl grabbed my throat and slammed me into a wall.

""Look how fucking weak and scrawny you are!  Do I really have to beat your ass in front of your woman?"", laughed Carl.

Fucking Carl.  when we were kids mom made Carl in charge because mom liked pills and Carl was my older brother.  nothings changed.

""Alright alright!"", I said.  ""Let me go to the bathroom first...""

""Leave the door open junkie"", warned Carl as he put his shirt back on, ""Because if you do what I think you are going to do I will break your fucking arm.  Do you doubt me?""

i hate my brother.  but the party wasn't bad because i took some of mom's oxy.  she gets the good shit and i dont care what anyone says a fistful of pure oxy is as good as heroin if you snort half of it.  Carl bought mom a flat screen TV which was a big deal back then in the 90's.  he even signed my name on the card which was cool.  we ate Mexican food, Carl's girlfriend made a chocolate cake which tasted amazing.  

as the years slipped by Carl always keeps an eye on me.  even though i grew my disguise and slip amongst the populace unnoticed Carl knows.  he looks at me and i feel like a little brother caught being bad.  but as long as mom is happy with this illusion i say fuck it.

Long time heroin user here, many years chipping, on and off full blown addict. I recently got a pretty big physical addiction, was using about 5-6 bags a day. I went cold turkey, beat withdrawals, but now I fucking relapsed after finishing all that impossibly hard shit. Fuck me, right? So, now I've been using a bunch again and got my tolerance back up. 

Recently, I got some dope off one of my guys and I did an average shot for me. The rush was really, really good. Not at all heady, just that warm, tight-chested feeling real strong. My favorite type of rush, I hate it when it's in my head. 

Anyway, it's weird though, because after the rush I basically feel sober. The rush is good, but I don't have any opiate high, like, at all. I don't nod, I can orgasm off no problem, and I really want to fix again because it basically feels like sobriety. I guess  I see two possibilities. One is that this isn't heroin, it's some pharmaceutical and two is that there's something funky going on with my tolerance and being an opiate addict. 

The thing is, the rush is *really* good, like, excellent. And if I shoot up and then shoot up again, the second rush is really good too, whereas usually (for me anyway) it sucks. 

Another piece of info is that I overdosed recently and a friend needed to save my life with narcan, so, idk how much that affects your mind but just letting you guys know.

Senior year in high school, and I was psyched to graduate. I had plans to move out to San Francisco with my sister during the summer. Through a series of unfortunate events, I ended up not having enough credits to graduate, and then got kicked out of my school. Well, fuck em, I thought. I'll move to Cali anyway and finish high school there. 

Turns out that the school system differed dramatically and i ended up just dropping out of the school in Cali. Whatever, I didn't give a shit. I was working, living with my sis, having a grand old time. 

My best friend from growing up was out in Seattle, visiting her sister. She called me, saying ""this town is awesome, you have to come up here."" So I went up for the weekend and loved it so much that we decided to stay, try to find a place to live. 

We trekked all over Seattle, looking at neighborhoods, trying to find a place to rent. We ended up sitting down on the sidewalk on Capitol Hill with a local newspaper, looking at the classifieds. All of a sudden, these two homeless kids come up and drop something in my lap. ""Merry Christmas,"" they say, and then sketched off down the sidewalk. 

I look down, and it's a little clear ziplock bag containing white powder. Okay, I think, free drugs! For just being young and cute and girls sitting on pavement!  

Jess and I end up looking at this apartment right down the street. The entire building is filled with gay couples, and the manager must have thought we were a couple because she immediately offers it to us with NO rental history at all. 

I go home for Christmas. When I get back, Jess asks me if I remember those kids with the free drugs. Of course I do! She tells me that she's letting them crash in our living room. Okay, I think... Whatever, I'm down for new experiences. 

Two people becomes three which becomes four, five six, seven, eight kids squatting in our place. And we find out they are junkies. That's okay, we are open minded. We keep a box of 200 needles in a TV stand. We make house rules, like no locking the bathroom when you shoot up because it's scary to have to break in when we think youre dead. 

We have a dealer routinely coming by to bag his shit out. One day we decide that heroin looks fun (I'd been doing drugs for years, but never dope) and we notice that Dana usually drops shit on the carpet while bagging it up. So we pick it out of the carpet and proceed to mix it up, having observed this countless times in the past. 

Fuck. I get it now. It's all over after that. I snorted monkey water for a week before having my ex shoot me up. A month or so later we get evicted and I learn just how fucking awesome living on the street actually is. ",1425264084.0

Note, my tolerance is essentially nothing, I did about 0.26 g of some decent H about 10 days ago and before then very sparing use so by no means do I have any kind of opiate tolerance, so I'm guessing this 50+ mg dosage will have me feeling pretty good, what do you all think?

So I had been crashing on my friend Larry's couch. I woke up one morning, did my breakfast hit and took the subway to go downtown. When I got there, I started walking toward my usual street corner. I would pan handle, but at car windows when they're at the red light. Way better than sitting on the sidewalk holding a sign. When got there, on the other side of the street, the cops were handcuffing some homebum, so I just stood there, looking at the scene, waiting for the cops to take off. When they put the man in the back of the car, they got in and crossed the street, stopping right besides me. Without saying a word, the cops ot out, grabbed me, told me to stay calm and rammed my face agaisnt the hood of the car, handcuffing me. Of course I didn't keep calm. I started yelling, confused, asking them what the fuck was going on. In a very obnoxious manner, they said: ""Ohh don't act like you don't know what's going on"". They took my backpack, emptied all my stuff on the ground and went through all of it. There was nothing but a few clothes and an empty can off tobacco, in which I would put my dope, drug paraphernelia and money. Luckily, I had no dope left, but I did have a pill container with 8-9 zopiclones in it. They turned to me with their proud faces and said: "" we take it you don't have a prescription for that?"". I said: ""no, those are just sleeping pills my sister gave me because I have bad insomnia"". ""Ohh look at him, he's ratting on his sister HAHAHA"". I couldn't believe it. I was so-fucking-pissed. They asked what her name was. Of course I didn't tell.
So they put me in the back of the car and started driving. Apparently, the homebum was trying to steel a bicycle, and according to them, I was the one who told him to do it so we would share the money after it had been pawned. At this point, I pretty much lost my mind. I was kicking, screaming and crying out of rage. I was screaming at the old bum, telling him to tell them I had nothing to do with all this. The weirdest thing was; the homebum wouldn't say a WORD. This is what pissed me off the most. I felt helpless and wouldn't stop screaming at that old fuck so he would tell them I had no part in this. Hell, I had not even met the guy before. 
So after like half an hour of driving around and me yelling like a crazy person, them laughing obnoxiously, they stopped the car, turned to me and said: ""okay, we believe you"". WE BELIEVE YOU. 
So they dropped me off at some random street corner,  at the other side of the fucking city. I had to walk all the way back. It took past an hour. I couldn't hop the subway because they said that if I got arrested that day I would sleep in jail.
Then, about two months later, my sister and I were squating in an empty apartment compartment that we broke into. One day, in that same building, in the entrance, there he was, that homebum, who supposedly put me through this trouble. I confronted him, menacingly, and asked him why the fuck did he tell the cops I was the brain behind this theft and why was he not saying anything while we were in the back of the car. Apparently, the old fuck had a baggie in his mouth with 140$ worth of crack, and wouldn't open his mouth in case the cops noticed. I was blown away. He then gave me a puff of crack, 6 cigarettes and a piece of weed, which I sold.

All and all, I think the cops wanted to teach me a "" lesson"". I can hardly believe he invented that story and explained all of it to the cops while he had a huge crack rock up his pallet. I think they just saw me standing there, waiting to panhandle, and decided to piss me off, because montreal cops DESPISE street kids. And, if would've really told that to the cops, I don't think they would've decided to drop me off, randomly, because they finally ""believed me"".
So yeah, Montreal cops are assholes.",1425242171.0

I've always been very responsible with them, never taking more than 4 at a time, and never exceeding 12 a day.

I was dry for a few weeks, and I was finally able to get my hands on some.  I bought 24 Norcos, so I would have enough for two days.  I took 4 at 2:30, 4 more at 7, and then 4 more at 11pm.  I passed out and woke up at 8am, popped 4 fore, and then at 1 I popped 4 more.  That's almost 7,000mg of tylenol within 24 hours and I've been pretty terrified of liver failure ever since.

After the final dose I got very sick.  I felt very weak and clammy.  Every time I would get up I would feel like I had to throw up.   Typically I wouldn't worry, but I realized how much tylenol I took.

I don't really know what I'm asking here.  I just want to know if you guys think that's a rediculous about in 24 hours or if you guys thik I will be one.

I know H/opiates are risky and addictive, but I have some questions.

First some of the guidelines I use are: 

 * track my usage
 * never more than 3 days in a row
 * never dose more than once in a day
 * thus far haven't exceeded 30 mg in a day. Typically around 20-25, 25 can give me mild nausea
 * only sniffing

So this is working out pretty well.  I'm probably naive, but I can honestly say I've never used a drug impulsively or recklessly.  I really only see it as a pain reliever.  I know that can change in a moment, and I'll be wary of that in the future.

Are there any short or long terms effects from my usage?  It seems like opiates are generally quite well tolerated and have very little if any long term downsides if usage is managed responsibly.  Am I damaging my sinuses?

Also, if I take 25-30 mg, as I know is common with opiates, I feel a bit of nausea.  Can I expect the nausea to lessen as my tolerance rises?  Thanks for any advice!",1425378087.0
2xrn8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2xrn8v/a_quick_and_dirty_guide_to_cleaning_and/,8,https://redd.it/2xrn8v,PCsNBaseball,A quick and dirty guide to cleaning and collecting resin from your tooter,"It was time to clean out my tooter today, so I though I'd throw this guide together, since I've seen smokers on here mention that they don't know how, or that they just kinda scraped the shit out. However, after awhile, [resin can end up just *covering* the entire inside of the tooter](http://i.imgur.com/GdJfDO2.jpg), more than can be scraped. So, here we go.

First, you need to [cut yourself a piece of foil, fold each edge over an inch or two in and crease it, then unfold](http://i.imgur.com/d4P8eoW.jpg). Next, on each corner, [fold from the crease to the very corner, making a little flap](http://i.imgur.com/tqjCa44.jpg). Then, [fold the flap down along the side](http://i.imgur.com/76qoc95.jpg), and do this for all four corners, and [you've made what we call a ""boat""](http://i.imgur.com/cWUMoFp.jpg).

Next, take your tooter and [cover one end with your finger](http://i.imgur.com/O0mI5pK.jpg). Take some isoprolol alcohol, at any concentration from 70%-99%, and fill the tooter between 2/3 and 3/4 full (I didn't have the hands to take a picture of this step or the next). Now, [cover the other end of the tooter](
http://i.imgur.com/U6uSiU9.jpg shake it, shake it, shake it. The longer you do, the cleaner it gets, and the more resin you'll be able to smoke. A little rock salt would help get even more, but I've never tried it, and am not sure if it would react badly with the opiates in the resin, so try it at your own risk (maybe someone here could tell me if rock salt is a bad idea or not).

Then, you're gonna want to [pour the alcohol into your boat](http://i.imgur.com/Nz2Z8dk.jpg). Your next step is easy: just wait! Isoprolol alcohol will evaporate at room temperature after awhile; I usually do all this right before bed, and when I wake up, all the alcohol will have evaporated, leaving me a sweet, sweet layer of withdrawal-chasing resin. I *HIGHLY* advise against boiling away the alcohol with a lighter, because the fumes coming off of it are VERY, VERY flammable, and will most likely light on fire, flashing flames in your face suddenly. It's happened to me nearly every time I tried boiling it. However, that does work to speed it up, if you're in a hurry. Once it does evaporate, just smoke it like you would regar tar. Warning: the smoke will be very harsh, and can sneak up on you, so prepare to cough a few times, and take it slow with baby hits. Good luck!",1425369802.0

So let's say I have 1G of BTH So I take .5 and set it aside incase I mess this up or I wanna try another ROA but anyway before I explain know I read this in another forum and it seemed simple enough but I have a few questions about it if you could just help explain or add missing parts to the process soo I'd have my .5 and set that upon a plate add 3-5 drops of water and dissolve the tar to a thick liquid then add the peeled crushed Tylenol pm to absorb the liquid solution and once that's mixed and dried you have a powder heroin so I was thinking and I'm certain the Tylenol would be a bitch to snort and be very painful! So what else could I use? That'd be more pleasant? Maybe just lactose powder and it'd be straight tar... That's my go to just bc adding the Tylenol pm with tar and mixing that with xanax might be a taddd too much! Soo rn we'll say I use lactose powder.. Where the fuck do I get lactose powder!? Hahaha also wouldn't there likely be hot spots in my powder? Now ratios would 5:1 be a good one? 2,500mg lactose /500mg of tar; 50mg lactose/ 10mg tar and that'd be one line.. And I can work my way up to be safe.. My morphine tolerance is decent I guess.. It's about 100mg but I plan on poppin 2mg-4mg (2mg first maybe move up later that night) of Xanax so I should start low on H too, soo would 1 line of the powder be enough? I only want to do 1-2 maybe 3 lines.. So please adjust your suggested ratios to that! Thanks please help me figure out the details!

Does it have to do with half lives? I read that somewhere, but I'm not really sure how these tests work. If I only do a little, can I do it like 12 hours before? I don't know, I just really need this job but am not looking to go through withdrawals for it.

&nbsp;


How'd it all start? Maybe, 8 years ago, I found some of that promethazine/codiene cough syrup when I was really sick and coughing alot, it had been sitting around in the cabitnet for as long as i could remember. Anyways my logic was ""more cough, more meds,"" drank a ton of the stuff and found out it made you feel really fuckin' good, lol. Shut up I was young. Fuck, I still am lol.

&nbsp;

Well that was un-intentional, and I wasn't even trying to get high, shit I just wanted my cough gone. The intentional shit, it started off about 7 years ago (so a year after the syrup thing, and I was a frosh in high school. During lunch hour someone offered me these codiene pills, they were 5-250 codiene/APAP, for some sport injury and they didn't need them anymore. All I heard was codiene and remembered saying ""Hell yeah."" Took 3 or 4 of em at lunch.  This next class, Survey of Technology, I just remember walking around real slow in a opi-haze feeling like walking was floaty. To this day I wonder if Mr. Otto knew, or was just too busy keeping tabs on the other fuckers in my class to notice me. I was one of the only motherfuckers who shut up and listened to him, because dude was cool, so I'm guessing he was like ""fuck it at least he's not making trouble.""  

&nbsp;

Okay, I said that was intentional, but more so because I said yes to free drugs, who wouldn't. Well a lot of people wouldn't, probably.... but I know a lot of people who would haha. The real intentional stuff started off 6 years ago (sophomore year for those still reading) with the pink 10s, damn a few of those fuckers were good when you didn't have a tolerance. Back when I was living with my parents, pretty sure I remember my dad walked in on me separating lines after I had crushed one down, told him some bullshit like I was ""doing zen stuff, the powder is crushed up Bottlecaps candy"" (there was a box of them on the floor, shit it was the first thing I could think of... lol anyways an awkward pause and then he left, I never heard anything of it. I thought either he was actually that gullible and believed me, or he did actually know what was going on. Looking back, he totally knew. Haha. My dad's pretty gullible but not that much.

&nbsp;

Well anyways we can fast forward through the rest of high school, the rest wasn't that exiting opi-wise... I guess sometimes I could get my hands on some 40 OPs and discovered what nodding truly was though. Yeah it sucks you can't snort em, but damn! You're high the entire fuckin' day. Don't know why people dislike em that much. Anyways, I couldn't find opiates more than maybe once every week or two, but I bought whatever I could get my hands on.. of course the monthly 10s from my ""provider"" lol. I'd also buy whatever extra Norcos (hydrocodone/APAP), percocet 5/500 APAP, etc, whenever people got hurt and ended up no longer needing the pain medication. I did that a lot, and I didn't even know how to cold water extract back then. (That's an easy crushing and filtering trick to get all that nasty APAP out - SERIOUSLY saves your liver a marathon. Especially because I was drinking heavily through high school) But yeah, not many people knew except for the people who sold em to me. It was my private way of finding happiness - I was severely clinically depressed, opiates are what I would say the best way to simulate happiness, and for at least a few hours, I could escape my depression. So now instead of just doing it to make myself feel good, I would do it and look forward to it as a crutch of happiness.

&nbsp;

Well college started, and I went to Milwaukee. Holy shit, drugs are everywhere, depending on the company you keep. Someone knew someone, pretty much. 

&nbsp;

And then I started working at Jimmy Johns, which is really just a drug ring. Seriously, THE Jimmy John is a cokehead, not unlike the other upper management. Jesus, the owner of the Milwaukee JJs franchise would regularly walk into our store already fucked up on something, and would publicly pull this guy from the sandwich line who always knew where to get good coke. 45 mins later he'd be back. All on the clock, of course, with some white-powder benefits... lol I was so into drugs (kinda still am, thats the current problem....) that I was like, ""Fuck yeah! this is awesome!"" For fuck's sake, my line manager sold percocet 30s to me, you know, the blue A-215's if I remember correct... My roommate worked at a different JJ's of the same franchise, and his manager sold hash oil and various other substances. The unspoken rule was: if your looking for a drug, someone within the JJ's circle can find you it. And find it I did. 

&nbsp;

Being a delivery driver, I would make cash tips all shift long, in excess of $100 per shift in JUST TIPS so no shit I was gonna go buy some drugs! I didn't consider it a problem at the time. Except it was. I was doing 3, maybe 4 of those little blue pills... thats 90-120 a day. People at school were worried and so, as an act of acquiescence, I made the grand gesture to Get Clean.... yeah, that lasted 2 months. I'm surprised it lasted that long. But at the relapse point, I was doing oxy 5s (pure, no nasty tylenol in there... a.k.a. you can crush em and snoot em up your nose...) and then the green 15s... and then back to the 30s... 

&nbsp;

I was doing them daily because when I was high I felt normal. I have anxiety issues, depression issues, behavioral issues... but most of all was the CONSTANT NEED, the MORE-THAN-CRAVING for that ""feeling of normality and happiness"" during a period of serious mental duress. Besides the internal mental/chemical issues above, my parent's divorce around senior year of high school really did not help my transition into college. ((HOWEVER - I lay no blame on them, what happened needed to happen, and my mom is doing so much better now...it was a good thing that needed to happen but that did not make it easy or happy...)) and I always had financial issues with college, couldn't go for an entire quarter once because of financial aid complications. Everything in my life seems to be a complication. But I digress... 

&nbsp;

Current day. All my pill dealers are gone or out of the business. In fact the only person really capable of finding them once and a while is is this [self-described] ""old dying heroin addict"" that we will refer to as simply J out of respect for dude. (side note, funny how close J is to H on the keyboard, cuz J got me into H....) He could only find pills once in a while, besides his monthly script for 180 pure 5mg oxy pills. I usually bought the entire thing from him, because he used the money to fund his heroin and crack addiction. Heroin is generally regarded as being cheaper (as in, more bang for your buck compared to the EXTENSIVE (&rising) price of pills). Well, J used needles and shot up his heroin, and being heroin addict for over 40 years, he knew where to find the BEST shit. Like seriously, you'd be waiting in your car for damn near an hour because his dealer was always running so damn late, but it was always worth the weight. The stuff he got was PURE, no dormant, no ""cuts"", just heroin. Very rare to find this stuff on the streets. I paid (pay) a pretty penny for that stuff, but it's worth knowing the shit you're snorting is pure, and not mixed with some bullshit powder to add weight. Nope, this stuff was still in rock form (probably not messed with since it left some clandestine lab in the Middle East or Mexico). I got HIGH as SHIT from SO LITTLE of it, that I stopped looking for pills. Because J could find me heroin, anytime during the day/evening/night. And he and I got along, he was an adult who listened to me and talked back to me as a true equal, us both being addicts. He was poor, and I felt for the man, so I'd throw him some extra cash for finding me this extremely high quality shit. We'd have to go sit in the ghetto sometimes for 45 minutes, but once they were there J had better be sure to move fast because heroin dealers sell to addicts, and have extremely little time on their hands. Anyways, this shit was good and I could get it whenever, and I truly got along with the old guy. 

&nbsp;

Plus, oh yeah, money wasn't really a thing, I was a well known weed distributor throughout my school and college and Jimmy Johns too, especially after taking over other dealers' clients when they went out of business. All of a sudden weed was paying the bills, buying the food, supporting my (heavy) weed smoking habit [I'd like to note - I DID successfully quit cigarettes, nasty things. Except occasionally when I've had a drink or two I'll have one, but it's more comparable to that old dude having his cigar once in a while]. So I was helping the old man, and getting my fix. Two months blurred of this cycle. Lost, to Heroin.... I honestly can't remember much of December thru February, during the viscous cycle. Have I mentioned tolerance? Well, basically your body gets used to the drug, and gradually needs more to get that high. Eventually, you no longer do it out of want, or because you wanna get high.... you do it just to feel normal. 

&nbsp;

Normally, I just crush the shit up and snort it. First it breaks down into shards and eventually powder. SNIFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, and 15 mins later I am GOOD.

&nbsp;

But the issue is when I tried the needle. The first time, I had J do it for me. I couldn't even watch, I'm terrified of needles, after many hospitalizations and TAP procedures. *shiver* But the needle didn't even hurt. I didn't feel it; 5 SECONDS later I was in my secret world of happiness. The second time I tried it by myself - I hit the vein right, registered, but halfway thru the shot something moved when I started to feel the rush and a good bit got injected into my muscles/skin instead of the vein (missed shot). For 4 days the crook of my arm hurt like no other, and I looked like a damn junkie if I didnt wear long sleeves/sweatshirts. UGH. But the urge... the urges are so hard to fight.  If you have not been addicted to a substance you cannot POSSIBLY know.

&nbsp;

The worst part: the withdrawals. I don't know if any of you are familiar with the pain and suffering of opiate withdrawals... this phenomenon occurs when you run out of pills or dope, and you come down from your last high. Your legs CONSTANTLY hurt as if you just ran a marathon, no position is comfortable. You get alternating chills and hot sweats, sometimes as little as minutes between hot and cold. Your brain refuses to concentrate on anything, except finding dope, really... the drug rewires your brain and how you feel. When you are withdrawing all you can do is curl up in a ball and hate yourself because, really, you brought this upon yourself.... and you can't eat, and you sleep all the time but it doesn't energize you like sleep should. I'm missing stuff for sure but thats the jist of it. The worst effects last for 4-8 days, but it takes a month or two sometimes for withdrawal effects to wear off. 

&nbsp;

Right now the hardest thing is trying to figure out how to divorce myself from something thats dug so deep into me. How do you cast away what has been your one escape from the shittiness that was my reality? Sure, it was debatable whether my reality really WAS shitty, I mean I've always been feed, had shelter, been loved, etc.... but depression is an ugly bitch who manipulates everything good out of your life while you kind of sit and watch, every second making you feel like you are worthless, you are a shitty human being, you are an addict, all these thoughts inside my head! But the pills and the heroin gave me a second reality, one where I actually felt HAPPINESS. All my life I've worn a facade of happiness, because that's what I thought people wanted me to be, what I thought people were supposed to be. And they do - they want to see you happy, they want to see you succeed. But it meant so little when my happiness was fake, inside I felt like the worst shit. But the pills, the heroin.... when that goes into your bloodstream you no longer give ONE SHIT about any issue, little or big, in your life. I had found my happy little pill. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


People say, Let God Help! and yes, I feel God is now helping me, now that I've asked, and meant it. But during withdrawals, it seems like he is nowhere. As if you deserve this, this is the price you pay that is past money. 

&nbsp;


But whether through rehab or my family and friends, deep down I know I'll come out of this a better person...I hope you keep me in your thoughts, and don't think of me as that one kid in the family that's just fucked up, even if it may be true.

I don't know anyone who does them, so I really have no clue how to acquire them, and I don't really intend on going out of my way for them, seeing as I wouldn't entirely know what I'm getting myself into. If an opiate was ever offered to me by a friend or friend of a friend or something, I'd probably try it though. Perhaps that's stupid to say, but I my curiosity for drugs usually wins. I thought I'd stop at weed, then I thought I'd stop at psychedelics, then once I tried MDMA, I figured why not ketamine, then my mind set changed to why bother say I'm gonna stop at a certain substance when I've broken that rule every time now. All the drugs I've tried are shrooms (3 times), LSD (4-5 times), MDMA (8 times), MDA (2 times), ecstasy (1 time), ketamine (6 times), coke (1 time), and if you consider it a drug, marijuana. To some that's not much, and to some that's a lot. As you can see, I haven't done a huge amount of any of those drugs, and they've always been spaced out quite a bit, so personally I find that I don't have an addictive personality, considering I've tried addictive substances many times with no problems. It's kinda a blessing and a curse, so far it's just been a blessing; however, the reason it's a bit of a curse is because I feel like I can get away with trying new substances without a problem. I don't know enough about opiates to have an opinion, but I have questioned if the people who get hooked on them have addictive personalities to begin with. I know that you become physically addicted and all, so that's another story, but I'm assuming you'd need to abuse an opiate for a certain amount of time before you actually start running into serious physical addiction, right? I'll admit, I don't believe in the idea of doing a drug just once if you loved the experience. I can understand if it was just decent. I mean, I tried coke once and although I enjoyed it, I didn't think it was nearly as good as people claim, so I don't really care to ever try it again. But yeah, I'll admit, If I were to try an opiate and love it, I'd certainly try it again, but I'd imagine that like my previous drug usage, I'd be able to space it out my usage far enough that it'd never be a problem. 

The main reason I'm interested in opiates is because my favourite drug is MDMA. Sure MDMA is an upper and opiates are downers, but from what I read there are lots of similarities in the feeling you get. The thing is, as much as I love MDMA, I'm not that into the speedy feeling, sure I can enjoy it since MDMA makes you pretty much enjoy anything, but I'd prefer to just be really chill with those feelings. I once mixed ketamine with MDMA and it almost killed the speedy feeling completely, and then added that slight dreamy, wobbly and numb feeling to the MDMA experience. It was amazing. I figured that the ketamine and MDMA mix might be the closest thing I've come to opiates. I could be very wrong though, but if I go by what I've heard people say or what I've read, they seem to match what I felt on that combo. Anyways, if I'm not wrong, it sounds like opiates are up my alley instead of uppers.

sorry for the wall of text

tl;dr - do you become addicted really fast? even if you have strong willpower/a non addictive personality? does an mdma/ketamine combo come anywhere close to opiates? i've heard that mdma give a similar feeling except for the speedy part.",1425456674.0

Think back on the tale I’m telling you now,

This isn’t fiction, it comes not from my head,

This isn’t a story about what’s under your bed,

Yes those creatures can scare, but none are more real,

Than the One whose presence one day you might feel,

Not a stranger on the street or a terrible dream,

This One is relentless, and has many means,

At first he’ll be subtle, treat you like his friend,

But that’s just the beginning; he has plans for the end,

He’ll confide all his secrets, and you’ll confide in him too,

He’ll give you ideas, fun things to do,

Things that defy what your mother taught you,

It’s all fun and games, the more time you spend,

But remember this now – this One is no friend,

What started so shallow begins to get deep,

He consumes all your time, robs you of your sleep,

He starts to demand, he’ll yell and he’ll scream,

Your life is now nightmare, when it was once a dream,

The more he demands, the less you resist,

Soon you’ll be powerless; all else will be missed,

No more loving family, no support from your friends,

Nothing but darkness, as madness descends,

The One will control you; you’ll do horrible things,

His voice will consume you as you’re pushed to extremes,

Remember this warning as you start to get older,

One day he’ll be there when you need a friends’ shoulder,

Resist, resist – resist at all costs!

Remember this warning or your life will be lost.”",1425443707.0

I've bought Cephalexin online before (from vet websites) and it has worked decently well for me (in terms of clearing up some infected spots where I either missed a shot or got an abscess).

I know infections are nothing to fool around with, and I know the warning signs--in fact I've gone to the ER before to deal with an infection that I knew oral antibiotics would be insufficient for (they ended up giving me an IV antibiotic).

I'm just wondering if anyone has any additional knowledge of some of the options out there.  I can go with Cephalexin again which I know works alright, but I've been reading that Doxycycline works well also, but is more expensive.  Does anyone know if the price difference is worth it?  I don't mind spending extra on my health, I just want the best option. 

I was also thinking that since I've taken the Cephalexin a few times before, I might be building a resistance to it, so it maybe it is a good idea to switch it up to another broad spectrum drug.

I know you're probably not doctors but we all pick up tips and tricks in the junkie lifestyle so I'm hoping someone of you fine people have information you can share.

Anyway, sorry for the long rambling post, I'm just looking for any information anyone has antibiotics, specifically, ones I can get without a prescription via vet websites.  

And a quick PSA for those who didn't know--the antibiotics made for animals (mostly fish and birds) are 100% identical to the ones made for humans.  You get the exact same pill with the same stamp/numbers on it and everything, but they are much much cheaper and for most of them you don't need a script.

Since then whenever I want to ""party"" for a few days every couple of months I've stuck with stop sign opana 40s.  

Yesterday I ended up with the round, smarty looking 40s without realizing that they have the ungodly anti crush tech in them. I only do the insufflation method so I ended up using a dremel to get a good bit of one shaved down but, of course, it gums up in my nose and feels like a starburst is stuck up there.  

I've spent the last few days Googling but I've yet to find one method that seams to have any major support to break this crap down. Do you guys/gals have any recommendations? Microwave the powder, mix with something (please don't say baking soda)?  

Ps: I should note that I considered just popping one since my tolerance isn't too high (roxy 30 for a hell of a buzz) but since I have no idea how many my while be released how often I don't know if it would annoy me/give me a buzz/kill me.  

Edit - For anyone that doesn't want to read through the comments it looks like the best method is grading up with a dremel/microplane then mix a bit of baking soda in (I did 1 part baking soda to 3 parts pill).

I got some T1s and learned how to do a CWE which is super easy. I used 18 pills, so I would have roughly 140mg of codeine. The pills do contain caffeine as well, but I've read that people can still get a decent high with the caffeine, it just makes it less drowsy apparently. Anyways, 3 hours have gone by since I consumed the codeine and caffeine solution, and I didn't end up feeling anything. Roughly around 40 mins after taking it, I thought I was starting to feel something finally kick in, but then it just went away, so that was just a short little placebo feeling. I don't use opiates, so I don't have a tolerance with them. The only thing I know about myself is that I usually do need more of a drug than my friends. I'm not big on drugs, but I dabble every couple months. I've only taken shrooms, LSD, MDMA, MDA, ketamine, a coke. Pretty sure that's it... I've mainly done MDMA and MDA, and ketamine. I usually just took a regular dose with the psychedelics like my friends, but with all the other synthetic drugs, I've always needed more. I'm not really a big guy, but perhaps it's due to my Scandinavian background? I dunno... Do you think it's possible I just needed more codeine? or is it likely I'm one of those people that can't get high from codeine? I've always felt that tylenol with codeine worked better for headaches than just regular extra strength tylenol, so I would have assumed that I can metabolize codeine, but perhaps it's a placebo that I found them better?",1425432549.0

I'm getting a few 30 mg Oxycodone, authentic US pharmaceutical. I'm about 240 lbs. I will be swallowing them but I have roommates that I don't want to see me nodding or anything like that. I'm looking for functional dose advice.

Now, I've done Codeine pills, Codeine syrup, Methadone and Fentanyl in the distant past so I'm not totally ignorant to the feelings. But I definitely have zero tolerance right now... I haven't done opiates in a long, long time and forget how to take them. I want to be safe with no major heart slowdown issues.

Am I doing it right or should I swallow a 1/6th (break the pill into 6x1/6 pieces) of a pill instead of 1/3rd?

Sunday, random drug test for IOP. Failed for subs. I had a meeting at 4pm with my councilors Monday, so I figured they would talk to me then. It's just subs so I thought the consequences wouldn't be severe.

I was wrong.

Anyways i keep at least 40 pounds of poppyseeds for emergencies so i haven't gone through any withdrawals in a very long time (been abusing opiates for about 5 years now), i tend to drink about 2-3 pounds a day and i estimate I get about 80-150mg of morphine from that amount (I wash each batch of seeds 4 times to get every bitnof morphine i can) I always see people posting about withdrawals and i wonder why more of y'all dont keep seeds stocked just in case? They are cheap, legal, and its very easy to get morphine from them, doesn't even take 10 minutes.

Im feeling really up and talkative today so i wanted to post something. If anyone has questions about poppy seed tea, the best methods to use, or websites where you can LEGALLY order it let me know. Just because we're addicts doesn't mean we need to go through withdrawals. I hope all of you have a happy, healthy, and safe day. Be careful out there.

So Sunday my good friend hits me up and is having a really bad time.She is not feeling too good, she is feeling kinda depressed and a little sick. She tells me that her mucus is getting clear and she is feeling better so I head out there. (She went through detox about a week or 2 ago so I bring her some dope).

Well, we decide to not be smart and we get some rigs and try to shoot up. Like I said in my original post we try to be clean as possible, we used bottle water, cotton swabs (the package was opened before though). We poke ourselves a couple of times, she can't register so she doen't shoot anyone in but I do it twice. I poked myself like 5 times...


So she got really sick today, high fever and just feels like shit. I was feeling kinda ill as well and when I drive him I take my temp: 101.5. I was feeling worse throghout the day. 



Basically I was wondering if you guys think we fucked ourselves up from trying to shoot or if we are just suffereing from being sick and the fact that we shot up is just a coincidence instead of a cause. I was thinking that we might have cotton fever but we didn't reuse any cottons. Also, we both have coughs and sore throats. What do you guys think, did we fuck ourselves up? Do we need to go to the ER?",1425545574.0

Couldn't fucking make it, hah.","I was a bit short on money this week because I missed about a day and a half of work last week because of the ice storms that hit the Southeast. So, WD hell started about two days early. Yesterday wasn't too bad, but today it peaked. Headache so bad I could hardly see straight, not a shot in hell of being able to sleep, muscles weak and ache-y, could barely muster up the motivation to get off the couch just to go smoke a cigarette, we all know that awful, familiar story. Luckily today is my day off, because I probably wouldn't have been much use at work. I finally was unable to stand the headache any longer, and I called up the only guy I know of who might front me a blue until tomorrow. I figured it was a pretty long shot; this guy's not particularly reliable and I regrettably resigned myself for the possibility that he might not even have any to front. Miraculously, against all odds, when I called him he just so happened to be going to pick some up right then. I popped the question, my heart (and head) pounding like I was asking death himself to spare my life - I offered to pay extra when I picked up more tomorrow, yadda yadda, you know the drill. Even more miraculously, he reluctantly agreed. Hoooly shit, relief is finally at hand... I get almost all the way down to his place (a pretty significant drive, he lives about 30 minutes away), and when I called he didn't answer. FFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU - if I've driven all the fucking way down here just for him to bail at the last minute I'm going to burn down his house and his family while he watches. Just as I'm about to throw caution to the winds and go knock on his door anyways, he texts me back. ""Meet me at QT in 5 minutes."" A symphony orchestra heralding the coming of Jesus Christ himself burst onto song in my head. After a short wait (but of course still way longer than 5 minutes) my guy finally showed up. I reached out to claim my glorious, long-awaited prize, and, mother of fucking god, he gave me fucking two. HAAAAA-LE-LUJAH! HAAAAA-LE-LUJAH! HA-LE-LUJAH, HA-LE-LUJAH, HA-LE-EEE-LUJAAAAH! Junkie Jesus hopped back on his chariot of pure gold and diamond, was borne aloft by a burst of silver clouds, and sped off, tires squealing and shooting jets of fire, into the black sky to find another lost junkie in need and make his day. Next time my guy brings his car to my dealership for service he's getting the royal motherfucking treatment. I'll have that son-of-a-bitch driving like it just came off the truck. I love when things work out.

Has anyone else out there every done a shot and then overdosed for say 20 minutes and then just miraculously come back all of a sudden?  

In the last 4 months I have had this happen probably about 8 or 9 times.  I will do a shot and then (according to the person I'm with because I will have no memory of this happening) I will black out.  Sometimes I will be mumbling gibberish in response to being screamed at and the sometimes i am completely unresponsive.  But basically every time my lips will start turning blue while I am still breathing (even tho it's abnormal and slower than normal).  And than all of a sudden I just snap back and I will have no memory of any of it.  The person that is with me will be freaking out even tho I have no memory of episode and they don't really do anything to help the situation other than freaking out and 'almost' calling the amber lamps?  

I had one a couple days ago where I was alone in my car in a parking lot.  As I was pushing off I was on the phone with a friend and the last thing I remember is saying ""oh wow, this is a surprisingly good rush"" and then BAM! 20ish minutes late I am waking up as if I had nodded out but the out skirts of my vision is incredibly fuzzy/blurry.  According to the person I was on the phone with I just stopped talking and went silent. When I came too I was pretty dizzy and I had a slight head ache.  The most intense side effect was that the out skirts of my vision was completely distorted/blurry. It was almost like there was a distorted mirrored frame that went around my entire field of vision.  i was immediately able to drive just fine I just had no memory whatsoever after commenting on how strong the rush was.  After driving for about 15-20 minutes my vision returned to normal and I was no longer slightly dizzy.  

Can someone explain what is physically happening when this happens?  I always thought that if your overdosing and your lips are turning blue that means that your overdosing AKA your system is full of a lethal amount of opiates (in this case heroin).  and that the only antidote is naloxone.  How is it possible that at one moment your full of a lethal amount of drugs and then 2 minutes later the amount of drugs in you is no longer a lethal amount?  

Do I have my insanely fast metabolism to thank for this? Is it just pure dumb luck? Was I never in any actual danger of over dosing? ",1425527117.0

3.) Good places addicts can go to taper off, cold turkey, and generally just quit using

Hes tried every medication for IBD, but stopped taking them all, so he's not currently taking anything systemic. 

Treating crohns with opiates is looked down upon in the professional community, because it encourages hiding dangerous symptoms.

Both his gastroenterologist and general practitioner have 'cut back' on narcotic prescriptions because of ""recent changes In government policy"".

He had been taking any given opiate (Percocet, codeine, tramadol, hydrocodone) off and on for about 7 years when his doctor recently cut him off,  and told him to go see a pain management specialist ""if that's all he's willing to take"".

So he found the closest pain management doc to his house who took his insurance and was seen within a week.

He signed a ""pain contract"" with all the rules of the office, and they asked him what pain medication I had most experience with. He said codeine (not thinking that he should have said something stronger) and got an Rx for 120 30/300mg Tylenol/codeine tablets per month. 

Luckily he can still get stoned if he wants on 120 mg codeine. It's also a perfectly fine amount of codeine per day to manage the pain he has. But obviously it's short acting and he'd rather have something stronger. 

He's looking for some advice on what to say to this doctor to get switched to Tylenol 4 tablets (60mg codeine) or maybe a semi-synthetic. 

Do any of you guys have pain management doctors and know how to talk to them?

He honestly wasn't even expecting to be taken as a patient, and he is thinking  maybe he should just be happy with what he has, you know, not look a gift horse in the mouth?

I'm a 33 y/o female, mostly just a lurker here but have been using opies on and off for about 5 years with my husband. I'm not a regular user because we can only get our hands on it every once in a while (mainly pills--only snorted heroin a few times). Well, last weekend we snorted maybe a gram of it together and the last time I took part was Sunday night. Went to work Monday and was fine.

Middle of the night Tuesday I got no sleep because of RLS I guess, major insane agitation that made me feel like I was gonna panick. I didn't think this was withdrawal related because we'd only been using for about two days straight here, break for a day or two, then get high two days etc. only over the course of a few weeks. Anyway I thought I was having a panick attack so I went to see my doctor and called off work. The Xanax he prescribed me didn't help at all, so I saw him again today. I was thinking maybe I needed something else, but never asked him for more Xanax or anything. I just said it didn't work and I was still having the crushing anxiety.

This time he said before moving forward he wanted me to pee in a cup. Shit. It's Wednesday and that last line was Sunday night. Of course I've been online and I've seen anything from 1-3 days for it to clear your system. What I want to know is if I can tell him it was only PST and not that I snorted heroin? He's actually a cool doctor, non-judgmental, etc. but I'm thinking if I have to confess to something, it's a lot easier to say ""oh shit yeah I totally forgot about that PST I had over the weekend."" However, if the test is going to say it was absolutely heroin, I'm not going to try to lie. How fucked am I? Sorry if confusing--I'm supposed to see him in a week and I want to be ready. To me, PST just sounds better than heroin if I try to think of it from the standpoint of a non-user/doctor. Am I just being stupid? Any help/advice would be appreciated. ",1425500236.0
