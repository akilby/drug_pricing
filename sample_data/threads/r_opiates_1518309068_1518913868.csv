I noticed my meds have barely been working lately and I am now figuring its because of the parasites. do they stop or take away the way the pain med breaks down ? 

some info: I have parasites. in my gut, probably even more places

I am in pain and miserable and it seems my pain meds barely work

wanna add: ive been diagnosed w it. 1000% have them. they wont cover anti worm script so im literally stuck

ADDING: I have 2 different parasitic worms. there is only ONE medication made for these worms. one. its $3000. I dont have $3000. I asked on here if its messing up my pain meds because I have inoperable chronic pain. I havent been able to leave my bed from the pain im in.

I'm feeling really anxious and shakey ever since I've stopped (yesterday). I've never felt this way before, and this feeling is hard to descirbe but I'm super on edge, can't sit still, and feel sort of twitchy all the time.

Is this normal for only using them for 1.5 weeks, and how long until I feel like myself again?

I know you guys don't judge so I'll say it I went online found a nasty looking prostitute and asked her if she's get me some dope if I payed her.

 I got some China. Knowing it was fent since it ain't tar, I did the tiniest key bump. Barely got high. Then me and my fiance argued cause she seen my eyes. I drove to my mom's for the night. I couldn't fall asleep so I thought I'll take another bump. Literally small as fuck to be safe cause I know it's dangerous. Don't feel that high but I'm well. I went to sleep, woke up in the ICU. 

My mom found me 10 hours later is what happened how i lived that long idk.The shit had bupe in it I wander if that's why I didn't feel like it was strong. Anyways it was the aspiration pneumonia that almost got me. When i came back i couldnt hear they said they had to do life support. I woke up early a few times so they strapped me to the bed. Sepsis set in. White blood cells dropped. Drs  couldnt say if I'd live. 

They said I'd be on the breathing machine for at least 5 days. I woke up after 3 full recovery. Also the breathing machine u can't actually feel your lungs expand from the air so it feels like your not breathing which fucks your mind. Anyways I was good then relapsed 2 months later. Now I'm a 2 days on 5 days off chipper with strictly tar. Wish I could stop but for the first time I ha e a plug and not middles.

Edit: I love you guys. Be careful everyone I don't know how I could have been more careful. They were almost guanteeing me I'd need dialysis at least after it all but by the grace of God I recovered fast. The doctors were literally amazed. I was scared when I woke up while getting life support to 8-12 doctors around me looking scared. One was holding my hand in tears.

When you become a heroin addict, your world becomes very small. 

You go from being a party kid with a lot of casual party friends...

... to a drug user with some drug friends...

...to a drug addict who hangs out with other drug addicts...

...to a fucking loser who only associates with dealers, resents the ones who try to keep you around and chatting when the only thing on your mind is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs fucking go home so I can put this shit up my nose/lungs/veins‚Äù. 

Being alone in your room with your baggy of drugs, clutching it like fucking Smeagol with his Precious Ring, finally feeling calm as you block the entire world out and let the drug take control for a couple of hours. It‚Äôs honestly really pathetic.

And to think I started using because I hoped that drugs would make me skinny. How sad. All I have now is my dope sickness and, occasionally,  a few days of euphoria mixed with guilt.

I only make enough to support my drug habit. I cant use other drugs to substitute opiates, weed makes me foggyheaded as all hell and i burns holes in my memory. benzos are addictive and i dont want to physically withdrawal from TWO substances. and i LOVE uppers but ive only used meth ONCE in my life (well actually it was a 3 day bender but that was the first and last time i used meth. loved it too much i knew i had to stay away) and i crave no drug EXCEPT OPIATES. Life doesnt fulfill me but opiates make it bearable and give me a reason to smile. Does anyone TRULY stop craving opiates and enjoy life after quitting? how long does it take? i literally get headaches all day and begin hating myself if i dont do opiates. but when i use opiates i function like a normal person and im even fun to be around (untill i run out). but when im sober all i think about is getting high. Suboxone really doesnt even cut it. Help me quit reddit? I feel like im  a little too deep in. My family is dissapointed in me, no girls care about me and most of my friends use drugs.

this story has just arrived. My friend took a shot of very good heroin, he was already stone and did not have a great tolerance, but he made a shot like me (I have 10 years of dependence behind me) luckily I had made a little one I think he wanted to do like me. It's been a week since I told him to take less but he does not listen to me
The material is much better than what he usually took, I warned him several times but he does not really understand.
So he took two shots at maybe 30 min interval (maximum), the first was ok for his tolerance, but the second was too big, I think.
I see him immediately nodding with the syringe in his hand (removed from the arm) so I took it and put it in a trash and I realized that it was too much for him (before that I had not seen how much he put in his shot he told me later). 1-2 min later, he goes to my couch, goes to bed, I watch him and suddenly he makes a strange noise as if he wants to inspire but can not then I shook him and slapped him, at first, he does not react eventually he woke up relatively quickly 15-30sec I think maybe more difficult to say in this condition. After that, he kept nodding and I looked at him insistently, asking him to breathe deeply and to occupy him to prevent him from nodding again. After taking a small line of coke (on my advice) to wake him up. But he was still stone,
T + 1h30 He wants to go home, I have withheld 1 hour but finally he goes away. In my opinion it's ok but I'm still worried, so I told him to put his phone on the max volume and I told him I'll call you in 15-30-60min and if he does not answer I'll come with naloxone.
Do you think there is still a risk for him to stop breathing? I think it was just the peak of the shot that suddenly stops his breath but after 2 hours I think it's ok ..
if you have constructive advice and opinions, ",1518329914.0

I'm on a LONG sub taper. At this point 1/2 milligram every morning when I wake up between 7 and 9. Most of the time, I'm fine. But once or twice a month, I get a vicious headache. This used to happen when I was using other opiates too. With heroin I just assumed it was a cut or I took too much, and with pills I assumed it was dosage related, but with the subs, I cut my strips into 16 equal pieces with an exacto, so it shouldn't be happening. I've thought of everything, what and when I eat, cigarette and coffee consumption before during and after dosing. Nothing seems to clearly be the problem.






I've heard that the bupe could be unevenly laid across the strips, so if I had access to 2mg strips maybe that would help, but if they were so uneven as to give me headaches like I've taken too much, it seems like sometimes I'd get them unevenly doses in the opposite direction and they wouldn't totally stave off withdrawal.

I owed Cliff a battery for the Mac Book I sold him. He told me to pay for soda a couple of times this week and that he'd order the battery on his pay day. Btw I made off like a bandit, do those in the know... it has a Corey2Duo.


Last week he wanted to hang at my house for a little because a girl was gonna come knocking to get pills bc ""she was desperate"".


Turns out according to my sub connect that he took this other girls $300 for blues, spent it for himself and told her that he needed it bc he was sick but he'd pay her back.

Here's some exerts from his message. Long story short, I told him I'd buy him soda tonight as I promised.

Cliffnotes/from text messages:

""Instead of the commercial  COKE AND A SMILE, its  PEPSI AND A BUMP OR 2""

""I dont always bother u w/bad news.  I want ya to hang a bit after and rip a bump or 2 maybe. Thats all.""


After he asked me if I'm still working til 10pm and after I said that I'd drop off his soda on my way home I also said:

""And I gotta get started an emergency turtle rank repaid when I get home for squirt.""

To which cliff responded:


""You know i dont mind coming over to ur crib and helping you wit the turtle repairs.  I just want to get out of the house, is that ok sir ?""

""Like obv u stop in to drop off the soda after work and id love to come chill after that.  That would be very cool.""

I‚Äôm more familiar/trust you guys.
I deleted my long dramatic posts..because they‚Äôre long and dramatic.

TLDR of the other post: boyfriend got sent to rehab, he has all the connects and I don‚Äôt have my car. I manage to get one of our dboys by commenting my number on his Venmo..


I Was supposed to get my car back Friday. They say maybe it‚Äôll be ready Tuesday. My boyfriend gets out Wednesday. I do not want to make him relapse. I hope I can even see him. His dad called me this morning, telling me not to go near him. That I‚Äôm no longer welcome in the house. That I‚Äôll get over it, I‚Äôm 18, and should go do some homework.

They don‚Äôt know I use. Like I‚Äôm clean to them. Maybe they think I‚Äôm the reason he relapsed. I wasn‚Äôt. He was using When I met him. If anything he‚Äôs the main reason I got addicted..
guess I‚Äôll just have to wait until he gets out and see how things go. Thinking about sending them a fucking edible arrangement. 

I‚Äôm sick. I had three bags, they got wet. Desperately left it out to dry, scraped it. Soaked the bags in water and boofed it. Water turned brown so I got something out of it... even shoved the fucking wet bag up my ass. Fucking pathetic.

I got this kid to drive me to (nj city were dope is sold) yesterday. Only he crashed his car on the way to my fucking house.

Today I got this girl who doesn‚Äôt use to drive me. Straight up told her what was gonna happen.

I call my dboy, straight to voicemail. Five calls and thirty minutes later he picks up. 300 dollars (100 from the original kid who was going to drive) for 70 bags. Fair. Whatever. I‚Äôve never copped alone though. I‚Äôm scared honestly. I have the worst luck. It‚Äôs like the universe is preventing me from getting this dope. Or being happy.

I‚Äôve never been this suicidal before. I know that‚Äôs bad to say. Especially since I‚Äôve had multiple suicide attempts. So it‚Äôs going to be hard not to purposely use 7/8/9/10 bags just to... make this stop. Maybe I‚Äôm naive and young. But I‚Äôm hurting so badly. I‚Äôve reached out to everyone I could think of... I begged my mom to bring me to my psychiatrist, they didn‚Äôt answer, I begged her to bring me to the hospital...written off as dramatic. A bunch of my gabapentin got wet along with my bags (a water bottle spilled in my purse). So I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôll work but I must have taken about 15-20 if not more. (100mg each). It won‚Äôt kill me but I wish it fucking would.

I understand I am dramatic. I‚Äôm scared because I‚Äôm alone and without my boyfriend. I‚Äôm always with him. I‚Äôm terribly attached to him and miss him dearly. I‚Äôve never been in love the way I am with him. And now everything is against us. I‚Äôd like to think he‚Äôd pick me over his family. He‚Äôs very mad at them. But in reality... they will kick him out. He has no choice. 

I don‚Äôt know how much I can take. I‚Äôve been suffering for six years from mental illness. I get no relief. Ever. No medication, no therapy, no iop... I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm biologically fit to be alive.

Anyway I guess the main question... I took .5mg of xanax today in attempt to stop my mind from racing. My heart pounding. The intense fucking anxiety and constant daydreaming of overdosing. Maybe it took the edge off. I‚Äôm not getting fucking shit out of it.

So, if I were to crush up some Xanax and boof it... would it work? I guess chemically, I‚Äôm not even looking to get high, I‚Äôd love to get high, but I want to be able to take .5-.75 and just.. get the most out of it. I don‚Äôt know what will make it most worth my while.

Any advice on copping too... as far as I‚Äôm concerned I call, go where he says, he walks up to the car and it‚Äôs  quick exchange, then I high tail the fuck out of that place. I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just nervous.

If anyone would like to talk by the way... please pm me. I know it‚Äôs desperate. I feel so alone. I‚Äôve been sitting in my bed for days... I couldn‚Äôt even tell you the last time I ate. I just feel sick. I feel like I‚Äôm dying. Nothing gives me joy...I cry and sleep all day. The minutes drag on. I can‚Äôt fucking take this.

By tonight I‚Äôll have my dope if everything goes well. And then I‚Äôll have to feel better...right? Oh god. I need to.

I don‚Äôt know how much I can take anymore. I‚Äôm weak.",1518301139.0

We binged for a few days a few times and fell in love with it, after abusing stims on and off for 1,5 years together but still maintaining control.

 We took a 8-11week break after the few binges, the last one being before the halfway point of summer. Then we started chipping, using once a week, usually 40-150mg used between us per session (most of the time all nighters because oxy keeps us awake)

We succesfully chipped until january, but started using almost daily in early january. Its now the night between saturday and sunday and we last used on wednesday so we managed to go to school. This is the only break longer than 1day we have had since early january.

Thursday and friday we just laid on the sofa as we couldnt get ourselves up and felt super depressed, have been taking a little bit of benzos to make it more bearable.

We were supposed to get an OC80 tonight but the dealer stopped answering, mayby this is a sign to continue not using, mayby not. We will probably try to cop some oxy tomorrow.

I just ask that before you go forward with whatever decision or thought you have in your head, just stop for a moment and consciously and figuratively take a step back, reconsider and think about that action, DEEPLY. Think about what its going to do for you right now, in 5 minutes, 30 minutes, a few hours, how its going to impact tomorrow and the day after, how its going to impact this day next month, how its going to impact the other aspects of your life that you don't currently have on the forefront of your thought process... like your relationships, your finances, your mental health, your physical appearance, even your appetite! Your ability and desire to do things like building new relationships, set and to achieve goals, go to the gym, eat properly, provide for the ones you love, be there for the ones who need you, be able to react in emergency situations, this list can go on forever. But im just saying, just for a moment, consciously/figuratively/even literally take a step back, and think long, deep, and hard (ha-ha for whoever makes the joke) about where the decision will or where it could take you. If ANY of the conclusions that you come to of where the decision could potentially take you are places that you dont or would never want to be at, that right there should be enough information and all you need to recognize that the decision has more bad than good to it, and maybe you'll pass it up this time. There is always next time. And hopefully next time you do this same exact thing and come to the same exact conclusion.

I can tell you one thing that is factual: You DO NOT want to live the lifestyle of an addict, whether it be opiates, stimulants, alcohol, etc., you do not want to live this life. Facts. You might think that it will never happen to you.. and hey, maybe it won't, BUT it probably will and youll wish you would have taken this advice. I wish I took this advice about a year ago, and im not even in a bad situation or in very deep, but one thing is for sure, and that is that i am in it. For the first time, i am actively in the life of an addict.

Also one other random protip: NEVER SHOOT COKE. Me, i have always been a downers person, never enjoyed stimulants much at all, always made me feel shitty that night and the next day physically and just never felt much out of sniffing coke, no matter how good or how much i did. One night i was in a tinychat and i was told that IV coke is an ENTIRELY different drug than when it is snorted. I thought what the heck, i dont like stims theres no way i could get hooked on that, besides ive sold coke for years and never got hooked on it, i never even do it when i have free coke left over from ounces. After i shot coke, it became the most fiendish high i have ever chased my god. I am not aware of the dangers of how much is needed in a single shot to overdose or how much over a certain period of time, and i dont even enjoy the high that much, but since i no longer feel much a rush from shooting H, and the immediate rush and physical/auditory changes i feel from shooting a good dose of coke have made me practically mix a shot every 15-30 minutes until its gone at any point that i have coke. ive easily shot at least a quarter ounce of coke over the last week, and thats probably lowballing. STAY AWAY. 

Tomorrow i am going to my first NA meeting. I am seeing a therapist on the 17th. And i will continue to fight this addiction until the day that i die.

Please, just for a moment, really, seriously, reconsider.",1518440502.0

I'm breaking down.","I quit IV Herion 8 days ago, I did cave and snort one bag because of horrible stomach pain thats from a virus I got about tuesday/wednesday. TBH I've had 3 stomach conditions for years and since about last june it just seems to have gotten worse. Doctors can't find anything even with MRI's and Catscans, the works. I've had two tell me they see this sometimes and they say with abdominal pain it's tricky. They know I'm in pain and not faking, but sometimes they just can't fix it ever. Both said it's possible I may just have to live with it forever. I'm only 28. While this bug has put me in so bad pain I've slept one night in a week and only a few hours and eat about half a cliff bar a day. Even when I haven't had this virus the pain is less but it never, ever, goes away. I'd give anything to have like knee pain or something but this constant burning knife in my stomach is hard to imagine living with forever. That's really about 80% of the reason I was using H and stealing even while on probation which I've violated. There's only so much I can take. Recently me and my coppin partner/partner in making money how we can just haven't been able to make half what we used to and the 9/10 dope that used to be around just dissapeared. I was shooting bundles and giving the feeling a 1/10. I just got tired of being dopesick 50% so I quit. I don't even care about the one bag today I sniffed. It was just to get a couple hours of relief. I don't plan on going back on H.

I know this will sound weird but while my buddy is still struggling to get off the garbage dope, I started smoking crack which to everyones surprise helped me quick dope. I'm not really into stimulants and it's definitely not my drug of choice but theres so much chaos in my life right now even 5 minutes of a dopamine rush is bliss and I was attracted to the non physically addicting part.

My fiance dumped me almost the same day I quit H. She never found out about my addiction. It was other issues that caused the split. I still love her and avoided contact until wednesday which was a mistake. She acted happy as a peach(she was faking which I will explain later). That crushed me. My mom is sick of my addiction even though I don't live with her and now wants nothing to do with me. Literally the only family member who still had my back after I went to prison for felony assault which I got for fighting back when my brother tried to murder me. My state has no self defense laws.

Every day gets worse. This virus is 4 times worse than my dopesick was. I know its hard to believe because IV dopesick is bad but thats really how bad this virus is. Even though I should be in bed, mentally I can't sit in my room alone. So sick as fuck, I go around making money in non moral ways and buy crack while my friend gets dope.

I think the only person who gives a shit about me is that addict friend. In 6 months, even when I just met him as a middle man, he has never beat me out of a dollar. We split everything 50/50 and we trust eachother completely. I've pawned everything but my computer.

Last night I couldn't breathe in my room and slept downstairs. When i woke up 2 hours later, I went to take my meds. I've been prescribed klonopin for 10 years because I got a brain injury in a car accident and it just fucked my circuits. No non benzo helps at all. I should have had about 23 in my bottle and when I went to take it there was fucking 3. I had a problem in the summer and noticed a few were going missing here and there but never like this. I have to go to the hospital in the morning and hope they give me the 5/6 day supply I need until my refill. In the summer when whichever roommate stole a bit too much I was only 1 day short and the hospital was really cool and gave it to me based on my word and I was out in 20 minutes. I'm hoping since this is only the 2nd time they won't give me a problem but its also 5/6 worth of kpins instead of 1 and I really don't want to have to file a police report which is what my doctor requires if I go to her. I live with 4 people but it's a big house and I rarely see the 2 other renters. The other 2 are my landlady and her BF and I trust them and let them know the situation. One other renter is an ex addict and the other is just really weird. She thinks its the ex addict but hes been clean 8 years and I just hate to imagine him doing me dirty like that. Benzos are not a medicine to fucking take from someone considering the WD possibilities.

To top it off, my ex fiance texted me about an hour ago she tried to kill herself yesterday. She wouldn't tell me much but it sounds like she tried to cut her wrists and her brother just happened to come into her room at the right time. Instead of being supportive her family screamed at her and told her she was fucking crazy.

The breakup is so fresh and once I get my shit together she said there's a chance we could try again(this was wednesday). This is the second time I've been engaged. I tried to tell her to talk to me because I know that feeling of wanting to end it all very, very well and I would understand. She still wouldn't open up, said she wants to try again a different way and then cut me off the phone.

I've already had a hard time keeping it together lately. As it is, next month, because I have a nice PO, hes only recommending and increase in probation level instead of jail time even though I've gotten two charges. As long as the judge agrees ill get another year on strict probation which if i carry on the way I am now I'll violate very fast. I have 8 years backup time plus whatever they'd give me for the new charges.

I will die before I do that much time locked up. The time I did already broke me and made me a worse person. Jail hurts more than rehabilitates.

I think just hearing the attempted suicide tonight was my breaking point. I broke down and cried and could barely breathe. If i got a call she does it again and does succeed then I honestly don't know if I could handle it. I want to marry this girl and she wants to die at 23 because she's having a bad week?

The first initial push stung like a mofo but didn't really burn after that sting when I tried pushing it in very very slow to see if the sting would happen again. It is kind of strange because I kept puling the plunger back to make sure i was still registered throughout. I went really slow and injected the H probably over 60 seconds. 

1) I have hit an artery before (Or nerve) and it also stung and burned in those situations so I've had to pull the whole rig out. There was one time I was very naive (sometimes still am) and kept pushing the plunger in while it burned but whole area was so numb from it I didn't feel much pain when doing that. (1A) - but Do you guys think shooting into an artery would sting throughout the whole shot? (1B) And do you think it's possible that the needle tip was just partially in my vein and out at the same time where it could register blood, but also 'miss' partially if injected?

Not sure if it matters but the vein I used is really small. It kind of runs over the pink knuckle and is barely visible. 

2) After the shot, the area around it, about a 1 inch circumference, became alittle raised and random raised bumps showed up on my wrist and forarm also. Do you think that's an allergic reaction, or from a partial miss or definitely artery hit? Besides those raised areas, nothing else is puffy like when I hit an artery before. Also, nothing really hurts.

3) Random question I always wondered, When you guys put the cotton in the dope to draw up, how big of a piece do you use and do you actually stick the needle tip into the piece of cotton or just kind of push the tip against it and apply pressure while drawing it up? 

Thanks all! Enjoy the rest of the night. ",1518413101.0

I'll take 2 or 3 ex lax and all it does (with coke, without does nothing) is bring some out with much more still in there. I've been constipated for way over a week now doing this sometimes and I'm really concerned. I went to the ER for this issue a couple weeks ago and was given Golyte and it cleaned me out great. Nothing at all works now and the only thing I haven't tried is Movantik

I'm seeing a doctor tomorrow or very soon to try and get Movantik. How do I go about getting prescribed this? I'm worried I'll be rejected since I Use fent... was thinking maybe I could lie and say Im on methadone instead.

I just really need help with this problem will someone chime in?? This fent constipation  is so hard to deal with and I want to try Movantik

I can get regular Narcan, would that be like Movantik if I couldn't get it for withdrawal to make me go to the bathroom??? :((

 I'm a dope user, but I'm currently in the process of quitting (perpetually so). I was using basically every day, maybe a half gram to a gram or so, but it was pretty bunk shit, so take that with a grain of salt, it wasn't a HUGE habit or anything. So I went four days without using and my withdrawal symptoms were basically subsiding, RLS was subsiding big, I could actually get comfortable, still getting the chills and having diarrhea, but for the most part a mild day four. Well I used like 0.2 that night and went like two more days without using, but I was definitely experiencing WD symptoms slightly worse than I was on day four prior, but still not bad, just sweating like a mfer at night.

So yesterday I needed to work a job outside for 8 hours straight. I'm starting to umpire youth baseball. So even though the WD symptoms weren't horrible by any means, the last thing I wanted was to be having the chills and hot/cold sweats while being outside in the cold and wind for 8 hours straight.

So, I dosed about 0.25mg of sub, and it was enough to make me feel good, like I was completely clean. No euphoria or anything, just clean. Well it has now been 38 hours since I dosed that and I'm starting to get the chills again, so obviously I'm starting to WD from the sub.

I start a new job on Thursday the 15th and *really* do not want to be having any WD symptoms when I start. In y'all's experience, do you think I should be fine by then? Do you think the WD I'll experience up until then will even be that severe? I know sub WD is supposed to peak around 72 hours, so I'm hoping it won't be too bad since I'm half way there and only have minimal symptoms, but I also know that sub WD can last a really long time, and I'm worried about not being over it by Thursday, or worst case scenario, having the WD be so drawn out that I don't start feeling really shitty until the middle of the week.

Recovery doesn't only happen in one way. People do get sober on their own.

The program is NOT the only way to get clean. If you relapse, you are NOT doomed to be a junkie for the rest of your life. If you have ever been addicted to a substance, it does NOT mean that you'll soon become addicted to other substances and eventually end up fucked and at rock bottom again.

I got prescribed Suboxone 8mg per day and am supposed to see a Sub doc on Wednesday. 

I also was taking 6 grams per day of Phenibut on average along with ~30 - 40 grams of Kratom before detox. During the 6 days I was in detox, they pumped me with a shitload of Phenobarbital for the Phenibut piece of the puzzle - 194.4 mgs for a few days, then a quick taper down to 64.8mg the day of discharge last Thursday. They then set me free with 5 32.4 mg pills as needed basically. I took two (64.8 mg on Friday), and on accident (seriously) took three yesterday 97.2mg. I meant to save the last for tonight but forgot I'd already taken two, to make the comedown smoother but whatever. I also was feeling incredibly anxious last night so I broke down and took 3 grams of Phenibut. Obviously I slept but this seems incredibly dangerous.  

Point is, has anyone else here taken Phenibut with their opiate of choice? I really don't see myself just not taking any more Phenibut suddenly just because I got a weeks worth of Phenobarbital tapered extremely quickly. I'm sure I can skip the day dose of Phenibut. I can prob go down to 1.5 or 2 grams of Phenibut at night and taper down. At detox they didn't seem concerned giving me a hardcore, long acting barbituate in high doses with 8mg Suboxone - they only monitored my vitals in the morning, and let me sleep on huge doses of it alone in my room. I was a fucking total zombie the first two/three days: no memory of what was going on. I'm with it now and trying to figure out a plan here.

Any thoughts? I don't know what to do exactly. I feel like they just staved off the Phenibut w/d with a barbituate and now I'm on an opiate that causes respiratory depression which Kratom didn't. Problem with Kratom was it was giving my tinnitus, and it was feeling unsustainable taking dose after dose since it had a short window of action. 

I didn't feel any trouble breathing at all last night, but so what? I talk to a doctor on Wednesday. I'd really appreciate any advice rather than insults for how stupid I've been or whatever. I think it's clear I have an addiction problem and this is not remotely my first rodeo with substances: it's just the current set.

Been off the shit for almost 2 years, consuming kratom daily.
Call me sober, call me relapsed. IDGAF I like kratom and I have grown exponentially since its use.

It is a sort of coping mechanism I'll give you that, but when you've stared the devil in its eyes, any sane person would need some help coping.

I used to be your plug, not literally, but I did supply about 7 counties in my metropolitan area with high grade h, e, pot, bars, psychs, whatever. I was ""the man"" 19 with more money than I care to admit, and was well known and respected by many.
All of that changed.

My PIC caught a federal trafficking case, and it just so happened I was supposed to go down with him. They had a case on me, and my lawyer told me to lay fucking low or I'm going down.

Well I quit dealing, but my dope habit sprawled out of control.

My girlfriend of 6 years began having physical arguements. Bitch wanted me to give her more spending money every month (AS IF 7k on bullshit every month isn't enough money).

Anywho, one day I lose it. My PIC called my mom from prison and told her I needed help. I'll never forget that day. I remember I smoked a blunt and prepped my shot, I stand up and look in the mirror.
I just see an empty skeleton of death.
I didn't want to die. I just wanted to have fun and feel good.

I know im rambling, I just need to vent.

So now fast forward 2 rehabs and 4 IOPS, I am currently a year away from graduating, my GPA is a 3.8 and I have a lovely ""normie"" girlfriend.

Problem you might ask? I'm still a junky. I occasionally slip myself some etizolam once every few weeks knowing good and damn well where it leads me.
I am not sure about you all, but our society is so fucked in the head.
I just had an altercation with a girl who told me anyone who uses drugs should be sent to a CONCENTRATION CAMP. It took everything inside of me to fight back what I really wanted to say to her.
God i dont know guys. I just feel like each and every day I am slowly losing it and eventually I am gonna snap and relapse, because thats what I know best.
My parents and I have never had a close relationship. Dad wasn't around until my teens, and was a huge factor in my drug habits.
The shittiest part? I tell my parents (divorced) everyday (well not so much anymore) that I've always wanted to have a happy family and be close with them. They never reciprocate.

My mom and I are decently close, and she never gave up on me, even when shit got rough so I know one day we will be in a good place.
but my dad? Everyday I debate whether I should block that side of the families phone number.
They never genuinely take interest in me, and when I seldom do go to their home they are quite honestly just mean people. I am part of a larger family and the way they treat the younger kids, and other people in general is just not something I want in my life.

But hey, I'm off drugs right? Thats all they ever cared about. They dont give a flying fladoodle whats going on inside my head. They just want that clean piss test.

Fucking christ what a rant. I don't have any support in my life, nobody to talk about this shit and if I learned anything its that I need to get this shit out and into the world.

So for anyone whos read this far. Thank you - I really take comfort in that, and I hope that things in your life are going well. If theres anything to take from this, I guess let it be to tell those you care about, that you love them. Because some of us didn't get to.

Peace

I also have a story a old friend  from back in the day told me. He says him and another were in the hood, ran into a guy looking to score like 5 buns/brick of H. Guy says to them ""listen I just got outta rehab about 3 months ago and been clean but I wanna find the best dope around so help me out and I'll throw yous a few $'s or a half a bun"". Dude I know says ok( but his plan with his boy is fucked up!), basically take him to grab stamps that are mostly fent so when dude falls out they'll dip his pockets and rob him of his dope, rigs,$, etc... So after copping they take him to an abando, shoot up. Dude falls out as planned, needle in arm. While dipping pockets grabs his phone and when he does the phone rings, it says mom calling(trying to find her son, so he answers the phone. Mother says hello where's ""whoever"" the sons name is? he tells her he's in an abando, and oh btw he's dying!!!! The abando is at (insert address here). Him and his boy take everything and leave him in the abando!!! Smfh 

I asked him if he knows if dude died, did his mom call 911, did paramedics come fast enough? He told me when they came back around from the store cops, paramedics were there. And the coroners were carrying the body out by that time... So he died! I said why didn't you just burn him and keep it moving? Why not just befriend him, or atleast call 911 for him? Still would of walked away with everything as planned?!?! He said ""I felt bad a little, but not that bad, I really don't gaf at this point...""

 We use to be friends and knew each other for years before his H use... Once he started H he turned into the biggest scumbag there is! I also use H at this point but would never even think to do anything like that and would like to think I'd never would!!!

A few people are scrutinizing me for posting this story saying I'm a scumbag, looser, piece of shit, etc...  I posted this for one main reason and that is to warn everyone to not be so trusting since I've read here quite a few times how people cold cop, and use middle men/strangers they meet on the street that'll do anything for a few $'s, a fix, and just a quick come up!!!",1518381742.0

Except with the refugee influx, we have a bunch of North africans/Syrians peddling bunk dope. Absolutely wouldn't recommend picking up from them folk, get your dope from Russians or Iranians like any kraut junkie worth his salt.


Germany has a pretty interesting dope scene, you wouldn't expect us to, but it's vibrant. Open air markets are pretty rare, save for major cities (by German standards, so at least 500k people). To make up for that we have other Junkie meet-up spots, like using kit vending machines, Methadone/Heroin clinics, or fixing rooms. Just shoot the shit with the locals, offer to toss them a bag or two, walk to the spot with them, and of course, DON'T LET YOUR MONEY WALK (some things are universal it seems). Get a number and there's your connect. The dope is always brown pretty much, it comes in from the ports of Amsterdam and Northwest Germany, at least that's my theory since the quality of dope is proportional to your distance from the Netherlands. Your gear comes wrapped in multiple sheets of plastic, my connect usually kept it in a fanny pak, which I thought was hilarious seeing him seemingly reaching into his crotch to pull out my product. You call the guy, he tells you where he's at, you take a walk (public transit fam, it's decent over here), and hand that shit over when you made sure feds ain't watching.


So where do I fit into this? I'll keep it short since I don't wanna dwell on past fuck-ups too much. I'm currently in my mid-20s, med-school dropout, slow-as-mud recovering fiend and wageslave. 5K in the hole to boot, turns out you can't spend your academic scholarship on dope and coke when you end up dropping out two semesters in. Who'd a thought?! I don't fit into this scene at all, but it got me out of many sketchy situations where people who looked a bit more down on their luck to put it mildly got stopped and searched. Sat next to a cop on the train home with a gram and a half under my tongue, thank fuck it was wrapped up good.


One of my more recent memories is meeting up at a train station which I will not disclose since it was pretty close to where I live. Wait for the d-boy to show up, he takes us on a wild goose chase around the city. First he has to pick up a recipe at the pharmacy (benzos, what else), then he starts getting into a public shouting match with a customer we ran into who had wronged him in the past (way to keep this discreet!). Randomly he stops to smoke his shitty spice, telling me to position myself in a way to hide him doing the deed. After a while he tells us to wait in a local park, he's gotta go to the source, break up the dope and bag it up. I am hurting at this point, it's been 24 hours. I hand him my 80 bucks though, since he's been trustworthy in the past and commence to lay down on a park bench. So here we are, four fiends growing more and more nervous every minute, pacing up and down, peeking down the street he left for. One hour, two hours. I'm starting to put this down as a loss when he walks up like an angel bringing the gospel of soon-to-be shot dope. Next thing we  head down to the local fixing room and prompty get denied. It's full apparently, fuck that's what I get for copping during junkie rush hour. We ask if we can be admitted into the other rooms out back, but they're apparently reserved for people smoking crack and dope, we're not allowed to shoot up back there since they can't guarantee we'll be attended to in the way appropriate for someone injecting (no staff, no clean needles to hand out, yadda yadda).


We say fuck this, walk a few roads down to the next park and shoot up using our nasty ass rigs with the numbers off, as well as our dull as fuck needles. It did the job done more than well, I nod out immediately, my using ‚Äûbuddies‚Äú take off with my cotton and rig (lol), the cops mistake me for a drunk (it was Oktoberfest season), all is well.


So that was that. If anyone is interested, I'll see if I can think of another story. ",1518380031.0

""Honestly I'm not really sure. Um. I'll go find that out though."" I hear him move into the next room and mumble a sentence or two before saying to whoever, ""Oh okay yeah."" Back on phone with me. 

""He's dying.""

My ears are ringing and I'm struggling to hold my eyes open. ""... What""

""Yeah you know when you like, cant really breathe good at all, your chest feels tight and hurts and your vision gets all trippy like your about to die? He's got that.""

""Honestly I'm not sure I'll go find out."" This motherfucker. Comes back after like less than 10 seconds. ""Uh yeah probably, but it isn't like 'AAAHHH we need to get in the car right now!' Sorta thing like it's chill.""

""Right yeah and I'm telling you the same thing right now. Wait why the fuck did your ear fall o-""

""And it was almost rock hard, and so I knew I needed to go to the doctor-""

""Okay that's great but again with the ER/Hospital thing I'm trying to get you to understand-""

He wasn't done. ""Doctor was useless. He just gave me the number of a different doctor.""

""K."" I give up.

""Its like bro you didn't go to school for a communications degree, you went for medical degree.""

""Uh huh. Right.""

""You should already be able to tell me what's up with me, not just send me to the dude who's smarter.""

So yeah that's what I'm working with. He's so sweet though I can't even be a little bit irritated. Definitely going to remember that phone call for the rest of my life. Now to the whole cello fiasco. 

Some stupid bullshit went down with Bud and his roommate, and he's getting thrown out. I was there and convinced him to let him stay until he could work up the money to get out of state because he wants to go be with his son a few states away (I know right?). This cello is the only thing he has to sell really, and it should get him just the right amount to take the Hound out of here and have a little extra money in case anything goes wrong. I convinced his roommate to let him stay til it was sold 3 days ago, he's about to not have it that way anymore. He won't let Bud stay for more than enough time to sleep at night, and won't let him eat any of the food, so I wouldn't be suprised if he got thrown out by tonight or tomorrow. His other options are trap houses and shelters, with the cello being his only hope he can't mob that around without almost guanteeing it'll get broken or snagged. 

Though it seems the customer base for fine string instruments is pretty select, this cello has to get sold so he can not be thrown to the streets, but instead make it to his son. Fuck I love this guy.",1518369820.0

In a 5 pannel drug test that has no specific OXY test only a standard opiates pannel. Would I be right to assume that I would have to take a lot to fail the test. Generally it's only insufflating a 20mg or a 10mg of ox once or twice a week max. I'm assuming that given the half life and the cutoff for semi synthetics in a standard test that I would have to be extremely unlucky to exceed the detection threshold (which seems to be much higher without the specific Oxy pannel)?

It all starts at an unfamiliar house. A bunch of chicks are upstairs getting costumes on for some Halloween party. They invite me and offer me a costume, I refuse. I leave the house and drive for a while, park on the street in some faceless city and start walking.. I see a blonde haired, skinny dude walk out of a building. He's bobbing his head as if he's listening to music. I follow him. He reaches into his pocket for his phone and out drops a colorful mix of baggies onto the ground. He keeps walking. I pick up the bags and catch up to him, tap on his shoulder. He mutters something without looking at me and continues to dance down the street. I put the bags in my pocket to investigate later. I return to the building he came from and open the door. It's an elevator.

The buttons go in order of 1, 4, 5, 7. I press 1. The doors close slowly but then the elevator starts to rush downward, then sideways, then upward, then downward again.. Finally the door opens. I scramble out into a dark hall of elevators to be met by ghoulish creature. It looks like a thousand-eyed woman-centaur on a grasshopper's body. The walls are a dark, dried-blood red. The creature has a clipboard. She asks if I'm lost. I tell her I just want to go back home. She says I need to go to the first floor. I tell her that's the button I pushed. She says to try the ""F"" button. I'm nervous. I go back into the elevator and press the ""F"" and close my eyes. The elevator sways like a goddamn ship, then the door opens. I'm in a dimly lit bar that only serves coffee. Everyone stops what they're doing and looks at me. The bartender is another one of those freaky cricket-ladies. She asks me if I'm lost. I tell her yes. She asks if I'd like a coffee. I refuse and go back to the elevator. I press ""5."" Fucking roller coaster this time. The door opens and I'm on a grassy knoll in the middle of a sunny park. The elevator stands alone in the middle of the field awkwardly but I think nothing of it. I start walking. Time to check out those bags I scored on the ground! Fuck yeah - They're fat and full of dope! I need to find somewhere to do them. I start walking faster along a path into the woods. A group of guys spot me. It's the dancing dude that dropped his bags and his twin brother. They start questioning me. One of them trips me. I scramble to get away. Fuck, now I'm not going to get to do this bag! I swear it wasn't me..

And then I wake up.",1518518859.0

So I started applying for jobs this past weekend and wasn't expecting anything but had a video chat interview today and was offered the job on the spot. I told them I could start next Monday but they said they needed the position to be filled ASAP and wanted me to come in Thursday, Friday and Saturday for training/regular work, 8 hours each day. I wasn't expecting anything so soon because I wanted to take this week to detox and start straight for work next week. However, being that I can't really leverage when I can start, if I accept the job, I'll be in for a rude awakening by Thursday/Friday with withdrawals. (I have 1 dose left of H I will take tomorrow morning). I don't have the funds to get more H, and even if I did, it's not enough to keep going this path so I want to get off. (And Although a job was offered, they never mentioned anything about a drug test, do you guys think I'm in the clear for that or 'Surprise Surprise, please give us your saliva/urine sample"" when I come in Thursday?)

So, I've read a lot of people attest to Kratom for taking away up to 90% withdrawal pain. I tried it once and puked it a few moments later. (I get nauseous, gag/heave when withdrawaing for some reason). I think I will try mixing it or taking it via capsules this time, if yall suggest it being better than Tramadol for H withdrawals. Does anyone have experience with Tram? Do yall think it'd be better than Kratom or both about the same?

So this is kinda opiate relates but maybe someone has experience here. 


Had a big time pill habit. Worst it got was around 150mg a day for 4 years. I stopped that by moving to Kratom for a year which obviously is similar to simply kicking the can down the road. Today I could proudly say I‚Äôm 7 months clean with no subs. Strictly lame ass sobriety. 

I still have PAWS, yanno the depression every now and then as all the physicals are gone. 

BUT I have a xanex and addy script I just got. I took about 2 mg of xans and 40 mg of addys. I feel so much better and way more productive. I‚Äôve takin this combo in the past when I was about 3 months clean and it made all the wd‚Äôs go away. 

My question is, once I go thru this xan and addy binge, u think it‚Äôll reactive some of my opi wd‚Äôs?? This may be an outrageous question but I‚Äôm nervous I may have mild wd‚Äôs similar to that of opiates. Anyone out there know, any help would be super dope.

Those who have had their share of heroin AND fentanyl withdrawals. Was one worse than the other? 
Say you've been a steady H user but suddenly the heroin in your city went ghost So you've been copping fentanyl (or vice versa). Do the WD's feel worse? come on faster? Last longer/shorter? 

I've been doing ONLY street fentanyl (not sure which analog) for about 2 years. I never tried heroin first, fentanyl was already full swing and H was/is hard to come by around here. Lately I've been getting an H/fent mix, I love it. It's a light-medium brown color, powder/chunky, vinegar smell. 

My question is: When it comes to withdrawals, Am I better off doing this mix rather than just fentanyl. Or would it actually be worse because it's 2 substances? Or would it even make a difference? Ideally I'd like to do pure H but that won't happen.

My question is, does anyone else get very intense tremors and muscle twitching while high? And even after they're high? It's really only happened during my last two uses, but I still find it very strange. I just sobered up maybe four hours ago, and I'm still shaking like a motherfucker. In fact, it is much worse now than when I was high. At least then it would only come in phases, unlike now, as I've been jittering and twitching non-stop for the past hour or so. A part of me is considering that maybe, just maybe it's some sort of mild withdrawal, but with the casual nature of my use (I went on a week long binge about a month and a half ago, didn't experience any withdrawal. Didn't do anything again until two days ago when I took 200 mgs of codeine, and then the same dose tonight), it seems very unlikely.

I had made a thread about this situation a few months ago. basically this 18 yr old girl hayley moore at this college near me (JMU) was dating this guy, joseph fondaco. they were doing dope and the girl ODs and dies. he doesnt get charged until her family runs a campaign to just ruin this kids life and they end up managing a way to get him charged with fucking capital murder!! the girls parents accept no responsibilty that their daughter was a junkie and blame this kid instead. sickeninig

well looks like he got a plea deal reduced to manslaughter, 25 year sentence all suspended but 6 months. hed been held without bail for about 4 months now so in a couple months he will be free

this goes to all parents of addicts - yes it is sad when a young person dies due to drugs. BUT IT IS NOT FAIR TO RUIN SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE BECAUSE YOUR KID WAS A JUNKIE AND YOU DONT WANT TO BELIEVE IT

here is a somewaht updated link regarding the case. http://www.whsv.com/content/news/Leesburg-man-charged-in-connection-to-the-death-of-JMU-student-Hailey-Moore-445906603.html

when i posted this last time you guys helped to flood comments to both WHSV, the Daily News Record, and JMUs newspaper The Breeze. both publications had biased, unfair articles which basically blamed Fondaco. would it be possible for us as a community to once again stand up for justice and write some letters to editors, emails, or opinion pieces? it worked very well last time and i was happy r/drugs can see the truth.

I am very happy he will be out of jail soon, fuck that girl's family is all i gotta say. sucks she died, but that gives them no right to crucify this kid. i hope everyone here can sympathize with this kid",1518487386.0

Very first time I‚Äôve ever come across a pressed pill, around my area. Its not common whatsoever here cause a lot of people haven‚Äôt even heard of presses and shit like that.

I guess it wasn‚Äôt too bad cause I got another 8mg sub strip for $10 from a buddy I went to way earlier in the day for rox 20s but ended up being phenfrazine or some shit like that.

Anyway I'm planning on shooting amphetamine powder, and the process should be pretty similar to what you guys are shooting.

What gauge would you recommend for IV use? I'm also going to try IM ketamine, what gauge would you recommend for this? I have ordered 27g, 3/4"" and 23g 1"" needles.

When I previously tried to IV, it was stupid difficult because I used a 26g and I didn't want to shoot without registering, and making sure I could draw back blood. From what I've read, the reason why this was so damn difficult is because blood is usually too thick for a 26g and it was pretty much impossible to pull back the plunger.

But when I look at what people use to IV, I got the impression that most people use very high gauges, but this means you just have to be sure you hit a vein and shoot it slowly, right? 'cause with a needle that thin, its highly impractical to withdraw blood.

Should I use the 27g for IV, and after being very sure I hit a vein, push slowly and see if I feel it, and if I do, I'm good to go?

so I‚Äôve been using heroin daily nonstop for half a year and this last week I switched to opium (the form I cannot name on here) because I ran out and couldnt get more dope. Opium withdrawal‚Äôs peak symptoms last over 2 weeks, the longest withdrawal I‚Äôve ever experienced, with the absolute worst symptoms at day 3 or 4. Never been through heroin withdrawal but I imagine its shorter.

I‚Äôm planning on cold turkeying soon. When I cold turkey, am I going to go through opium withdrawal (long) or heroin withdrawal (shorter)? 

My logic is that since the heroin is out of my system, I‚Äôll go through opium withdrawal. If I go through opium withdrawal, will it feel like I was using opium for half a year (how long I‚Äôve been on heroin for)? ",1518477641.0

Yesterday, I felt the most uncomfortable and painful feelings in my life. I used to do a lot of pills and cocaine when I was a teenager but grew out of that. Once I lost my brother I developed an alcohol addiction. Then, back in December, I shot heroin for the first time. 

But before all I did was drink. I live with someone who has been a heroin addict for 5 years. I told him to go to a clinic and he agreed he would go. We had to pay $15 a day for a Methadone dose for him every morning. We used to work together and both lost our jobs because I was his manager and we were sleeping together. It's a bit more complicated than that though. He is from Romania and would screw up the register almost every night because he had trouble with our currency. My boss thought he was stealing from the drawer and would always ask me to keep an eye on him. Since I was always closing with him, and sleeping with him, they fired both of us. 

The fun started when I got really drunk and we decided to buy some ice. I asked him to give me some because I was drunk and wanted to try it and he complied. I was addicted to the rush and had fun with it at first but it got old because we couldn't sleep and we started getting paranoid. Then we would miss the clinic and he told me he needed dope. Now I know he was bullshitting me but I didn't know, I felt bad for him. 

Eventually, I started to do it. Then we ran out of money, cuz no job and paying $15 a day. We were getting dope by getting points for our dboy and giving him rides wherever he needed to go, selling off our shit, lying to our friends and family what we needed the money for until we exhausted all of our options. Eventually, we were both using every day until a few days ago. We had nothing, negative money in the account, burned bridges, no dope, no methadone, no food or gas money, no weed, smokes or beer to take the edge off. 

Then withdrawal hit and holy hell. I had been through alcohol withdrawal and I know it can kill you but goddamn the withdrawal from dope was one of the most painful things I've experienced. I hit rock bottom. This guy doesn't love me, I know that but I'm glad he was there for me. He just held me in his arms while I shook and tremored and felt like I was dying. My bones hurt so bad I couldn't hold still. We just lied there in silence, other than my groans of pain, and I looked up in my dim room wondering what the fuck happened. How if I just died right then everything would be okay, well, for me. I had no prospects for the future and owe an ungodly amount of money and apologies to my friends and family. I hated my life and how I was so fucking stupid to put myself through this shit and how I let the man next to me down. I was supposed to help him and instead, I enabled him and used him, let him use me. 

It's day 4 of being almost completely sober, took tylenol and vaped some tobacco, and I feel positive. Time to dig myself out of this mess. Not sure why I feel this unprecedented euphoria and positivity but I'm gonna take it and run with it. I don't really have any words of wisdom or encouragement for you guys but just knowing I won't be judged for talking about this gives me comfort. I barely had a taste of that life and now know I don't want to live that way, I can see it getting so much worse. I've seen how our dboy lives and read stories on here of withdrawing in prison. Maybe I'm a little bitch for typing this out but whatever, we all have our own paths. I was miserable unless I was watching him cook up the dope for us. Now I look forward to seeing the beauty life has to offer again and maybe this time, without the alcohol.

Bud and his running partner, aka ya boy right here, can hustle fine string instruments. Was that one of you guys though, or was Bud right and it was God? Because it worked out rather perfectly. 

By the way if you remember from last post about the guy who was supposedly dying but in such a way that it was not at all considered a medical emergency, here's the update. I totally fucked that off, didn't even see Bud until way later than initially planned. One of the things I had to take care of before going to that trap was with my homegirl, Flail-Bot 3000. She flailed and fuckin flailed and I tried so hard to work with her and ended up leaving her stranded in a rock quarry and way late to the dude who was supposedly dying. Could've lived could've died, I don't know. 

So last night Bud calls me. It was a discouraging day for the guy. If he didn't have concrete, verifiable progress to his moving out of the house by morning he was getting thrown out then and there. With for the most part just a cello to work with, and him and I being in the trade of hard drugs not string instruments, we weren't getting our hopes up. No cello sale then no reliable living, no necessary resources, no being a father to a son, no shelter until jail via racial profiling by the police, etc. Since he considered it his last night at the house and he was just alone in it, he wanted me to come over and spend it with him. I get there, we chainsmoke cigarettes while we have real talk, share stories and try to sell other smaller items for at least a little something. About 30 minutes in I have a sale for a watch I have lined up, another sale for another watch, and a trade, but then I a get *piiinggggggg* ya know, fb messenger? Some rando added me and asked, ""Hey man, how's it going? I heard you have a cello on the cheap I've been trying to get one within my budget."" 

Well fuck me sideways friend, you can bet your own toned taternuts that I sure do! I show Bud the message, he grabs my phone staring it right in the fuckin screen with his eyes lit up accommodated by a huge smile and says, ""Oh my God! Is this real?"" And I'm not fuckin around here, just then his phone gets a *piingggggg* ya know the Facebook thing, yeah. It was another rando contacting him about buying the FUCKING CELLO. Bud and I read it together and in the same tone as 3 seconds before he says, ""Oh my god! What the fuck is happening?"" 

You guys. Seriously please tell me if it was you or what, but within the next 50 minutes after the first ping, we had a total of 9 people hit us up for this cello. 3 hit me and 6 hit him, never met or heard of any of these people. From what we gathered, someone I know knows someone who knows someone who knows someone who mentioned a cheap cello at work where our buyer overheard it. We sold it to the first guy who hit me up 7 hours after he sent message, had the money in hand at 6AM this morning. 

So again. 

I'm not fucking kidding please PM or something because I've never believed in miracles and I don't want to start now. I'm going to see Bud out of state within the next 4 days, and I'm going to miss the absolute shit out of him, but I wouldn't try to chain him here or make him feel bad because he's actively pursuing what he greatly values, which is his 2 year old son. I've been in some horrible, some great, some hilarious some unmentionable positions in my time in the drug scene, but so far this has been the fiasco that I value the most.

For the record, on the way to sell this thing in the early hours of morning driving down the highway, I told him he can for real tell me the actual origins of this cello, it's about to be over so just tell me I absolutely must know. Period. Like it's a thing. All he really could say was, ""I already told you, it just kinda showed up."" I'm pretty sure there's a lesson to be learned from this little cello fiasco, like what they do at the end of South Park episodes, or King of the Hill? Is it persue your greater values even though you're pretty clearly just gonna fuck it up the more you try? I don't know. Either way I'm happy with the way it went.

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 4 years and I have always known that he deals with severe pain on a daily basis. He was born with a deformity in his hip that causes the joint and socket to slowly disintegrate over time. He will eventually need a hip replacement. He‚Äôs also been in two serious motorcycle accidents in the last 10 years. The most recent one was about 3 years ago, and he almost died. He had a punctured lung and shattered his kneecap along with injuring several vertebrae. He was in the hospital for about a week and out of work for several months. He was given pain medication in the hospital but when he got out he was drug tested before the doctor would refill his prescription and he failed for weed. So the doctor gave him Motrin which he never took. I know this is true because I read the paperwork, even I was like wtf. As far as I know he has no legitimate prescriptions for any opiates. 

He is the kind of guy that doesn‚Äôt like to show weakness and tries to be very masculine and macho in that sense. I know that he is in pain every day because I hear him whimpering in the morning when he thinks I‚Äôm asleep. He‚Äôs becoming more immobile and after work he just comes home and sits on the couch smoking weed until he goes to bed. He‚Äôs very stubborn and is terrified of the doctor so he just ‚Äútoughs it out‚Äù and refuses to talk to me about it (which is another big but unrelated problem in our relationship). So when he exhibits the behavior I‚Äôm about to describe and I ask him wtf is up he just says he‚Äôs ‚Äúfine.‚Äù 

Now I personally don‚Äôt do opiates, and I actually think I‚Äôm allergic because they make me feel really sick and weird and itchy every time I take them. However, I‚Äôve seen people nodding off and have had friends that abuse them, so I feel like I know what it looks like. Over the past 3 or 4 months he‚Äôs been acting really fucking suspect and it seems like he‚Äôs fucked up for the following reasons:

He comes home from work and immediately goes into the bathroom for like 45 minutes. When I ask him what he‚Äôs doing he‚Äôs says he‚Äôs taking a shit and that I need to leave him alone. Ok, that sounds plausible, but still weird to me since it‚Äôs like the same exact time frame like 4 days out of the week.
 
He just passes out on the couch, like head back mouth open passed out. It doesn‚Äôt seem like regular ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù and for someone that claims to only smoke weed (he never drinks) it‚Äôs seems really fucking odd to me. It gets to the point that I have to shake him and then he wakes up. Sometimes for a minute then goes right back to ‚Äúsleeping‚Äù or is just awake. 

His mother is prescribed Vicodin and I know he ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù takes one for his pain. He claims to only take it when it‚Äôs so bad that he can‚Äôt move. He frequently gets very defensive when questioned and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a fucking junkie.‚Äù 

He‚Äôs a generally grumpy dude, but sometimes he just seems really high and way happier than usual. I‚Äôve been chalking that up to the fact that he‚Äôs a pothead but my gut is telling me something else is happening. 

He‚Äôs also constantly broke despite working a full time job. It‚Äôs not a great job, it‚Äôs in a kitchen, but still. You should have some money and I don‚Äôt think weed and your car insurance costs your entire paycheck. 

His general demeanor lately has been really uncharacteristic. Like extremely angry and just not giving a fuck about me or anything really. This past weekend was my birthday and he passed out on the couch at like 8pm with his head back and his mouth open. I kept checking his breathing and waking him up because it scared me. I told him all of this and how I think he was on something and he laughed and said he was ‚Äútired.‚Äù Wtf.

I‚Äôm not a fucking idiot and I kind of think I already know this is what‚Äôs happening, but I would like some outside validation. Like I said, I don‚Äôt do opiates and idk if some people just sleep like that or if it‚Äôs indicative of being on something. I just want to say that I‚Äôm not judging anyone that does this, but I‚Äôm scared for him and I need to know if this is what I‚Äôm dealing with. I appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply. 

TLDR

Boyfriend passes out all the time, acts weird, has chronic pain issues and I think he‚Äôs abusing opiates but I don‚Äôt know for sure. ",1518467824.0

So yesterday was my birthday and I was calling texting around trying to find some 30s i already had some but wanted more. Anyways I called 2 of my main dealers but they were out for the month. So I text this one guy I use to deal with couple months back always did me right and when I sold to him I always did him right. Well I text him and see if he still had the 15s he texted me about Friday I was gonna grab them from him 4 for 50. He replied back and was like  ""I can get some 30s how many do you want?"" I replied and told him 3. Well we decided to meet up at a store that really busy all hours of the day right down the road from my house. 5 or 10 minutes pass and I'm waiting for my buddy i don't see him but I see this black guy walking down the road from my buddy's house (mind you my buddy is white I'm talking about). So this black guy goes in the store and is in there mayne 5 minutes then he starts walking to my car knock on the window and Is like ""you tyler?"" I was like ""yeah"" he said ""trey wanted me to bring you these he didn't want alot of traffic at his house"". So I'm looking at these and I can barely see a imprint it almost looked like they hit some water. He was telling me they were the real deal and shit but I was like nah bro I'm good but I'll give you a ride back up the hill to his house. So I head back home then my so call buddy trey text me and Is like ""hey I got some other ones you can read they are the E8s"" he sent a pic and everything they were the real E8s. I guess he thought he was gonna give them fucked up ones to me but I didn't want them cause I felt sketched about them.  Anyways after about 10 or 15 minutes I went up to his house actually which was a bad idea I should of told him to meet me at the gas station again. So this black guy comes back out gets in the car and the first thing I see in his hand is a baggie of the E8s my eyes are focused on them and not even him. All the sudden this black guy says ""just give me the money"" I said ""what do you mean?"" He then pulls out a glock shows me that there is a round in the chamber. Sooo at the point I was trying to stay calm, I also had my Ruger SR9 on my side and my CCW he could not see that at all. So I say ""you gonna shoot me if I don't give you this money?"" He said ""nah I ain't gonna do anything if you just give me the money."" So now I'm like fuck it I don't know this guy, I don't wanna get shot let me give this little $90 so he can get the hell out my car. I wanted to just get out the car turn around draw my gun and shoot his ass through the window but that would of looked like a drug deal gone bad or some shit plus the gun was still on me. So when I did hand him the money he was like nah that ain't all you got.. So I gave this other 10.00 in my pocket I also dropped my phone between the seat so he wouldn't try and get that and i left my wallet at home since I was just gonna be 5 minutes. So after he got that 10 he got out and started waking back into the house. I thought at that moment should I pull gun out and at least try and wound him in the leg while he isn't looking? I didn't want shoot him In the back as much as I wanted to I know that was a big no no. So honestly I just let it walk cause either way if I shot him and the police came wondering why I shot him I had no legitimate reason why i did other then he pulled a gun on me.. there's a always a reason. I also thought if I did shoot him and the police came I was gonna tell them I was meeting him to buy something off the App letgo, I had no messaging proof for that though.  I honestly don't know if i did the right thing or not. I wasn't gonna call the law after that situation.. Idk i was calm during the situation kind of but my mind was blank that's the first time anything like that has ever happened to me. My life is more valuable then a $100 cause I didn't know that guy I didn't know if he was gonna shoot me or not.. So idk if I did the right thing or the wrong thing.

Ever since then the doses ramped up pretty quickly. The sad part is I read the stories about people dying and all the heart problems and started doing this AFTER.

Think I was going ok for awhile and then I kept experiencing severe weakness and shortness of breath that lasted months, still not enough to stop me. My family thinks I'm sober, and I have put on a good impression for awhile but I'm broken.

Not broken enough of course to stop taking it, but broken enough to where I'm starting to avoid responsibilities more and more, so I know it's a matter of time before it gets bad. 

At least with my other addictions I eventually could come out about it after feeling defeated, but how the fuck can you tell anyone ""Yeah I'm addicted to this anti diarrhea drug and have been for the past year"". The withdrawals are absolutely insane and I only pasted 2 weeks before caving, and not once in those 2 weeks did they seem to start to diminish.

I've had suicide attempts years ago, but don't have the balls to go through those again, at least explicitly.

I think that this shit is gonna kill me one day and I can't seem to care enough to rr ally address it. What a waste of a life right?",1518457433.0

I've been clinically depressed for years, without a single day of relief. I also have BPD (borderline personality disorder), chronic anxiety and severe OCD (which affects every single aspect of my life). Please don't mention therapy. I've changed about 10 therapists and I know that it's not about ""finding the right one"". I cannot be fixed. I've been going to different psychologists, psychiatrists and therapists. I've been on Xanax for years. My psych basically experimented with me: he tried on me so many pills that I've lost the count - Rivotril, Prozac, Escitalopram, Adderal, Zoloft and Hydroxyzine being just a few. Xanax is the only one that's keeping me alive. Zoloft made me psychotic and I almost stabbed my roommates and jumped off a roof. The others only made me feel worse. Therapy and counselling hasn't helped a tiny bit either. In fact, they made me feel kinda worse, because I was trying my best but I could not see any results. I am so jealous of people who can snap out of this terrible place with therapy. Also, ""professionals"" in my country don't know shit about mental illness. The only mental illness they've heard of is depression, and no matter what your symptoms are, they'll give you treatments for depression since it's the only thing they know. The most severe aspect of my BPD is the depersonalization/derealization which makes me feel unreal, unable to recognize voices, unable to recognize myself in the mirror, I cannot feel like I have a sense of self and I literally dissociate 24/7. When I tried to talk to my psychiatrists about derealization, they knew nothing about it. The only relief I got was from one single therapist who diagnosed me with BPD and OCD (he was the ONLY professional in 10 who actually knew about mental disorders other than depression) and talking with foreign volunteer psychs about my symptoms. So why do I even bother?

&nbsp;

I think I'm tired of this shit called life. I have two choices: start doing drugs or kill myself. I know I might sound overly dramatic, but I can't cope with the chronic pain anymore. I know it's stupid. But being in constant pain isn't any better either, is it? If I don't do something quick, I'll end up killing myself in less than 3 months because I can't cope anymore. My rose-colored glasses were shattered a long time ago and I can no longer see life the same way or basically enjoy anything in life, like hobbies, music or relationships. So what if the heroin is going to fuck me up? Like I'm not already fucked up, lol. Whatever I do, I'm still going to die. I'll die either by suicide or overdose, in case I start doing drugs. But with H, I'd probably manage to make the last few weeks/months of my life less painful.

Since I know the rules don't allow posting locations or names, I'm going to be very blunt: how do you find your dealers? How do you not get caught and jailed? I literally don't know where to go or what to begin with. Where and how did you find your first dealer? I really need your help since I'm new to this and I feel so lost.",1518616853.0

My little sister OD'd. She passed away at 27 last week. My whole family is a mess. Add to this that it seems some friends she was with may have left her on her lawn to pass away, and it's quite cold here right now. 

I have a question. In a text to a friend, she stated that she was shooting dope and smoking base. What would this kind of OD feel like? Was she in pain? Did she know what was going on? Did she feel cold?

The 'friends' called 911 (we think), then took off and left her there. Nobody attempted CPR. The EMTs attempted narcan and used the AED but she had no heart rhythm. When her 'friend' was there, they saw she was breathing a little. I am wondering if CPR had been performed at the scene if she might have lived. 

I guess I am just looking for answers. I love my sister so much and it hurts me that anyone would leave her like this, or that she might have been frightened or cold. She was still a human being and deserved to be treated as such.",1518603396.0

My dealer has 2 4mg Nasal Narcans and one .1mg IM Vial. Within 30 seconds and realizing that the kid has gone down, I have the first nasal dose given. Nothing happens after 30 seconds to a minute. I give it a second dose and again nothing happens.

I read that you need water, needles, and cotton balls. But really I dont know what that all entails and I wanna be safe ( high tolerance was using a lot of roxys 30mg everyday for a year but have since slowed down)

Found this out after randomly noticing my Costco stopped carrying them. The price of them on Amazon is skyrocketing so I think retailers are already beginning the process of getting rid of their loperamide in favor of the 8 packs. The reason they did this is because there were 24 cases of heart issues in 8 years associated with loperamide. That sounds like a really low number to warrant this action, but as we know the government does all they can to ensure you rely on prescription drugs and heroin. Good luck to you guys!

 - phenibut
 - gabapentin
 - baclofen

I have heard gabapentin is a Godsend for the RLS, which is by far the worst symptom for myself.
I figure that since both gabapentin and baclofen have their uses for opioid dependence, that maybe the dual pharmacology of phenibut would get the best of both worlds?

Also - in case of emergency, if it is all you have, what about Suboxone or even Subutex in a shot or under the tongue...

As a shot, even 2mg of Suboxone has 0.5mg of Naloxone... And 2mg of Bupe isn't gonna OD anyone. Even if the Naloxone didn't hit, the Bupe would replace the other opiates on the receptors throwing the person meanwhile, into Precipitated Withdrawal - and that would be good I think since PW means that at that time, there are few if any, opiates on the receptors.

And even once the Bupe does attach, 2mg would be a low dose. And even in a non-tolerant person, it is notoriously difficult to OD off Bupe - it causes MUCH less respiratory depression than other opiates (and has a better safety profile in general) and the respiratory depression is what you're trying to reverse in an OD.

So yeah - I'm not advocating IMing Suboxone in normal circumstances but in an emergency... Any thoughts on this?

Fast forward to now, and I‚Äôve wasted so much of my parents money because I just stopped going to class because I got so caught up in my head and couldn‚Äôt focus.

My life was so good but I threw it away because I‚Äôve become a weak minded person.

Was in the the middle of some horrendous fentanyl/H withdrawals last night and earlier today. I was bawling my god damn eyes out, feeling as hopeless as ever, anxiety on high, will to live on low. 

My boyfriend (non addict, doesn't use opiates) says he'll be right back his friend is here and has something that might help me. I ask what he says something called clonidine he thinks. I'm thinking meh. Never tried it for withdrawals yet but didn't think it'd do much. 

He comes back with a few clonidine and 6, possibly 7 (I forget) 15mg oxys!!!! Fuck yeah I'm thinking. My boyfriends asking me if this is a good thing, they're only 15mg.. I said it's better than 5mg!! Thinking I'll be cured and maybe a bit high I do em all. It mildly helped. I was able to relax for a bit.. calmed down and the sweating lessened but I was still sick. I've done oxy before but only a handful of times. 

This was like 90/105mgs and it didn't get me well? Should it have? How much would it take you all personally to get well from oxy?

I see everyone's pill posts but it seems they are all different from what we have here. Does the US and Canada have all different brand pills? These ones were a blueish/indigo colour with APO on one side and OCD 15 on the other side. I didn't take a pic I was a mad woman the way I consumed those like a wild boar.

-=

If you like you can TL;DR to the end. I'm just discussing my lope experience. I realise, every time lope is mentioned, people chime in with their opinion, others then dismiss or argue. We've have never had an actual survey to determine for how many people it genuinely works for and a scale of effects-to-dose. So, please respond and I will compute the results.


-


-= My Story =-

So, it's the weirdest thing. I have tried lope for withdrawal and I need at LEAST 96mg to take effect. On the whole, it works for 12-20 hours where 95% of withdrawal is taken away. I've never tried it for more than 1 day for fear of severe life-threatening constipation where something may rupture. So perhaps I could use it to taper down by removing 10-20mg a day. 

I find it really difficult to experiment with Loperamide, so I have only used it very sparingly on emergency days and because of the amount of time it takes for me to feel its effects (Every time -
 it takes between 2-3 hours before it begins to take effect.) it's difficult to draw and immediate conclusions or work out if I either do, or will need, need more or less. So I take a known working amount every time straight away. People say thats a high dose, but for me, its not. Thats what it takes to feel 'semi normal' and I have never suffered any ill effects or feelings. 

I don't know why it takes so long and nobody else has ever mentioned it online as far as I can recall. I guess for most people its the same as a standard pill (20-45 mins usually) And I have tried gelcap and instant-dissolve varieties to no difference.

Perhaps its just my chemistry. (Quick Aside: It upsets me when I see users arguing with each other about effects that they don't believe occur in people - but everyone IS different, people process differently and so-called claims of extreme doses or effects from virtually nothing should not be dismissed as hyperbole)

Personally, I believe that lope only works in me after it reaches a 'saturation point' in the blood that allows it to overcome the blood brain barrier protection and cross the membrane to enter the brain.

Yay.. so, now, the moment we've all been waiting for.. Of course, I know just how much junkies absolutely love questionnaires and surveys! it our number one go t... ah fuck it. I just wanna know about your experiences.

**I wish Reddit had a survey function for AskReddit style questions where people could anonymously vote and we could get a more accurate data point for some silly questions. Maybe I could link to an anonymous Google Doc page and build a tickbox survey?**


-


No high-tech survey code built into Reddit, so alas, I may have to tally up whomever posts and put an edit in here.

-


So, I know some people say its a total sham, it doesn't work at all for them.


Some people swear by it, it takes it all away all their problems and could taper off all opiates using it (Damn, why don't they!).


For me, I need what would be a silly high dose for other people to get an effect where after SEVERAL long hours waiting, it gets rid of most withdrawals. Side effects: I'm just a little spaced, colours are super bright and everything is mega in-focus! I ache a bit. But the sweats, chills and nausea are all gone and you bet your ass I don't need a shit! I don't taper because I am worried what that amount would do over a 3-4 day period of time. However, that day I do get is a HUGE win towards clean days, making it easier so I'll take it.

--

TL:DR

--

Collecting results for a survey on lope effectiveness as every time its mentioned its just a bunch of anecdotes and arguments over whether it truly works or people are experiencing a placebo effect as for some people it does nothing, others its a godsend. (I'm in the latter category)

Here are my questions, if anyone feels there should be other questions asked, go ahead and suggest or add the answer to your reply.


---

My questions: 

----

Lope Dose (mg) 


Time until Lope Kicks In


Duration of Effects


Percentage of withdrawal reduction


Side effects


Cost per Day *and*

7xlawh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7xlawh/when_local_banks_suck/,22,https://redd.it/7xlawh,sloan_fitch,When local banks suck..,"A couple of months ago I went to the ATM with Cliff's card to get money for his dope and the dope he owed me at the time. It was 20 degrees outside so I wore my ski mask, goggles and heavy coat for the bike ride.


Upon arrival I put the card into the machine and I enter the pin, type the money amount I want and wait. The machine spits out a receipt with an error about the pin being wrong. I do this one more times before calling Cliff because I didn't want to enter the wrong pin three times to prevent a lock-out.


The pin was right, so I try it three more times while on the phone. I then suggest that he calls the bank. Well, fucking shitty local bank. You can't even call someone in India to get help at 4AM. 


Oh and on the way home I realized that I left the card in the machine in the indoor ATM area and left my debit card at home so I couldn't re-enter to retrieve it. First I turned around to verify that I didn't drop the card on the ground. Then I had to rush home and back to get my card so that I can enter the vestibule of the bank to get Cliff's mom's ATM card back. Luckily it was so late at nigh/early in the morning that nobody else showed up to use that ATM while I was pedaling my ass off. 

&nbsp;

Cliff called the bank at 8AM when they opened, and all he had to do was create a new PIN. Once done, he took care of the rest and called me at 10AM with good news of success on all fronts. The dboy was ready at 4AM and he was prompt to arrive around 9AM.


The reason this happened was because of a bunch of activity on Amazon, all legitimate activity. They locked the account until the account holder could come to the bank in person to pull money out.

Oh an for the new ATM card, the person on the phone says ""we'll mail it right out."" So Cliff (well actually his mom, it's her card account) asks for the card to be over-nighted to them. The service rep said, ""sure we can mail it out overnight, it'll be $65. We can take the money out of your account if you want.""

&nbsp;


This happened again yesterday/this morning 4AM. If I had work today I'd be super pissed because it would've ruined my sleep. Same reason too. So once again, Cliff's mom has to go to the bank to address this but she can't go until tomorrow because she wasn't feeling well.

I've worked in customer service call centers before and I understand that the rep is faced with some annoying challenges. Following the rules when the leviathan organization that you work for drops the ball is really fucking annoying.


&nbsp;

Key points about the debit card being disabled for security reasons:


* There is no way to prevent this if you use both Amazon Fresh and Amazon prime for items in the same day. Once a a lot of activity occurs, the bank just kills the card.


* The account holder can send a family member to the bank with a check but can only pull out $300 at a time per day until the account holder comes in.


* The bank will do nothing for the inconvenience, which I sort of understand but it still sucks when the account holder is an invalid, needs to order food (and pay for her son's dope) and doesn't own a car. The won't pay for the cab.


* They really dared to charge $65 for overnight shipping on a replacement debit card despite the situation being caused by no fault of the customer. 


* If only the bank simply called the customer on the phone and asked, ""did you do all this shit on Amazon today?"" Perhaps the bank could've maintained notes in their system for future reference, but apparently not.

I have been on Oxy for basically 2 years with only really 1-1.5 years of daily use. It started slow, but now is at 90-180mg daily. It is time to stop, I am in debt, it is fucking me financially, but it hasnt really affected any other part of my life thus far. I have a perfect girlfriend, and amazing support system at home. As well as a great job, sports cars, big truck, own a Garage, etc. 

I have ONE SINGLE Suboxone 8mg film, I plan on using to quit this demon. I also have 2 and a half 8mg Subutex pills in which I hope to throw away. Two days ago was my last dose of Oxy, 30mg in the morning, final dose was 30mg at 3:30pm. 24 hours later, I was feeling minor withdrawal, and I inducted 1mg of sub. One hour later, I felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Bone fucking sober, which sucks, but normal. I have been feeling okay, worked 3rd shift all night, slept, just woke up, and now feeling a bit achey like those withdrawal pains, but NOT awful. So here‚Äôs my plan. 

Probably take roughly 1mg of Sub film for the next 3 days. (Today, tomorrow, Sunday) and then start to cut them into the smallest slivers imaginable and see if I can manage on .5mg, .25mg, until it‚Äôs all gone. At the very worst I have those Subutex as a back-up. Once I run out of Sub I probably will order some good quality Kratom and take that for a week or two, as well as liquid Imodium for stomach issues. 

I figure, at this point, I will be far past the physical withdrawal of the Oxy. Shouldn‚Äôt have any physical withdrawal from only using VERY lose doses of Sub for a week. And if I become ‚Äúaddicted‚Äù to Kratom, then so be it. I‚Äôd MUCH rather trade an Oxy habit for a Kratom habit. Financially and health wise. 

Thoughts? Opinions? Am I crazy? Haha I have done my research and I‚Äôm not dumb, I know the Thomas recipe, I know the Robert 325 taper plan.... blah blah... I‚Äôm going to try THIS and see what happens. If nothing else it will be an experiment of sorts :) ",1518795577.0

Junkies HAD to get creative. Most of us stole needles from our doctors office or bought them from someone that had a source for needles and at 5 bucks each we even had to learn how to sharpen them using a matchbox striker sandpaper.
The old hype kit was amazing! It 'auto flagged' and worked awesome! To make one is simple and until you have made and used one shut up!! 
First thing to get is an individual needle. Still made and used but mainly for countries that sterilize and reuse them.
A push up stick ice cream. Throw away the ice cream but keep the hollow plastic push up stick. A needle fits it perfectly! 
Next is a baby pacifier, the type that has a ring on the end to help hold it to the big plastic piece that prevents baby from swallowing it.
Use heavy sewing thread to squeeze the pacifier onto the push up stick. Wrap it from the ring about a quarter inch up, tightly so that when finished the pacifier is compressed tightly to the end of the push up stick so that there is no space for the dope to get trapped in.
I always cut the push up stick to no more then 3/4 inch from pacifier to needle.
Twist on the needle and it's ready.
To add water to the dope for spoon cooking just squeeze the pacifier b put the needle in water and release. If you draw up too much water just squeeze the pacifier to get rid of the excess. Squeeze it to put water on the dope, cook it, drop in a piece of cotton, squeeze the pacifier, put the needle on the cotton and release. Once the dope is drawn up, tie off and tap or push the needle in. When you hit a vein it will flag without you doing anything b when it flags squeeze the pacifier to inject as slow or fast as you wish, if you release it will flag again. When it's all in just squeeze again and put the needle in clean water or alcohol and release, when full squeeze it out and repeat until happy that it's clean.
Just as there was a time when there were no computers, cell phones or ANY of that shit there was a time when junkies HAD to be creative! I MUCH prefer the old school hype kit over clumsy disposable shit!!  ",1518794085.0

I know the high doesn‚Äôt last long but I feel like it was so strong that it put out for 45 minutes and woke me up when it was over, Lol. Now i‚Äôm completely sober typing this post and eating cereal. Maybe i‚Äôll do a smaller line next time.

Knocked out for 45 minutes. Woke up completely sober. ",1518776200.0

I'd also like to hear some opinions on my situation and just enjoy the company.

&nbsp;

Before November I was one of the ""I hate needles, heroin is not for me"" types.  I smoked a lot of pot up until around 7 years ago (had the first kid) and have just used drugs very recreationally since then.  Pot when it was around at a party, shrooms if they fell in my lap and the wife and I had a sitter, coke if we wanted to have a bit more fun, but that was about it.  I've tried several other drugs in the past but became somewhat tame in parenthood.  My wife was the same way, but her old DOC was coke.  But things changed about a year ago.

&nbsp;

I had a decent paying job, but at the end of 2015, my location, manager, and hours all changed with almost no extra compensation, just the stress and lots of it.  My wife was able to stay home with our youngest (almost 4 now) but she was going crazy.  She was no longer digging the home all the time housewife lifestyle and our marriage was taking a beating.  Sex became rare which used to be one of our big ways to relieve stress, and neither of us took the initiative to seek therapy or counseling for help.  I turned to alcohol and she turned to spending money and borderline hoarding.  Communication was also becoming strained.

&nbsp;

Eventually, my manager and I had too many disagreements about whether certain practices were ethical and I was tired of bad reviews in spite of being the most profitable employee, so I quit.  I had somewhat discussed this with my wife before I pulled the trigger, but it was still somewhat abrupt.  I had a large savings account and a few prospects lined up, so I wasn't worried, but she was.  More than I realized.

&nbsp;

The end result was I became an unreliable drunk who would sometimes become mean and loud, make stupid decisions like trying to drive, and get so drunk while watching the kids I couldn't safely be the only adult.  I was awful and didn't realize just how bad I needed help.  She tried for a while to help me realize how bad my actions were hurting the family and she tried to get me help.  I went through a detox program after a few weeks long liquor diet, but it became too much for her.  She broke after about a year of my shit.  And just as I was regaining control.

&nbsp;

July last year I had my drinking under control, I basically quit completely.  And June of last year she had one foot out the door.  She stopped coming home most nights at the end of July, choosing to sleep at her sister's, her mom's, her friend's, just not home.  Without my realizing it (I was trying to give her as much space as possible by taking charge of all housework and child responsibilities) she had begun using coke very hard and started trying other drugs without telling me anything.  Communication had ceased.  We were also now dangerously low on money.  

&nbsp;

On Halloween, she came home obviously high on something and passed out as I was putting the kids to bed.  I got worried when I couldn't wake her, so I opened her phone to call who she was last with and of course to see if any of my other suspicions were correct.  Of course, they were.  She had met some guy in September through Tinder, they fucked a few times over a week while she was high on various drugs (coke, alcohol, GHB, pot, maybe others?  She says she doesn't remember) and then he got thrown in jail for drug shit.  She felt terrible and even suicidal about what she had done and hoped I would never find out and started shooting heroin with a friend to stop feeling.  She had been using for about 2 weeks at this point.  

&nbsp;

I fell off the wagon for a bit after learning all this.  She stayed at home now and took care of the kids and left me alone while I slowly died.  Then I found her heroin stash.  She had told me she had quit.  So after the kids were in bed, I brought it all out and told her to make me a nice hit and to inject me.  I didn't really leave any room for a no.

&nbsp;

It was a strange sensation.  It took her a minute to get me registered since she was shaking a little and I was very tense.  It was really strange.  I had no idea what to expect because I had never read up on how it makes you feel.  All my anger, rage, pain, sorrow, and irrational emotions sort of dissolved and I was able to look at her again.  And talk.  While my hit was taking effect, she made and did hers.

&nbsp;

What followed was the most sincere and honest communication we'd had in years.  We stayed up all night talking.  This was sometime in the 1st half of November last year.  And ever since, we've used together and we've begun to slowly heal.  We both think we should still seek marriage counseling and possibly therapy, but it is astonishing.  Nothing just went away by any means.  We're both still very hurt by the other's actions.  I don't know if I will be able to stay with her after she cheated on me.  The thing is, I am able to think about it, we are on good terms, and the only reason in heroin.

&nbsp;

TL;DR:  Two fuck-ups fucked shit up and all seemed fucked beyond repair and could be, but communication is not as fucked up as before and a fucked up drug was the key.

&nbsp;

I'm sorry this turned into such a long piece, but it's the first time I've actually typed everything out.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, we're now totally broke.  I won't be able to make next month's mortgage payment unless I get a job ASAP.  There are also A LOT of details I've left out and a few things modified to make sure no one might recognize this.  I look forward to hearing from everyone!",1518769075.0

I mean do they WANT to see more people die? Because that's how it's done. Ban the safer alternative so people feel inclined to just return to harder opiates.

Its just like crazy to me... Kratom,  while not some wonder drug, does a very decent job in my experience for keeping me mostly away from heroin or pills. It is not nearly as dangerous or deadly as the government likes to pretend it is. It legitimately makes me frustrated because it is a decent cheap alternative to using harder opiates, and a lot of the ODs involved other drugs so the cause of death can't be with 100% certainty ruled as related to kratom ingestion. But the fact that the DEA is even slightly worried about kratom when we have a massive fentanyl/heroin/pill epidemic on hand is just like, insane to me.",1518768415.0

So I‚Äôm prepping the shot nothing unusual. Used water from a water bottle in the car, which is something that I‚Äôve done before. Made it, and shot dat shit. So fast forward two hours later.......I went to give my pup some water. My boyfriend then asks me ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt drink out of that water bottle did you?‚Äù And I immediately said why! He then says that earlier when he gave the pup some water she didn‚Äôt end up drinking most of it and he decided to pour what she didn‚Äôt drink back in the bottle of water! He wasn‚Äôt in the car when I was making the shot because he‚Äôs terrified of needles and just doesn‚Äôt like it. So he wasn‚Äôt able to prevent it from happening. 

Will I be okay?

Sidenote: I did not pull up water out of the bottle and contaminate it with the rig. I wouldn‚Äôt have shared the water with my puppers, if I had put the syringe in the bottle. I poured water from the bottle into something else and then used it. ",1518761427.0

When I just went to use now I only had four left. I think my boyfriend stole some when he came over last night and this morning.

Last night I had my pouch in my room when he came back. He just got out of detox. I went downstairs to get us drinks and brought my shit downstairs with me because I didn‚Äôt want to trigger him. When I got back upstairs he got upset and said he didn‚Äôt like that I did that and didn‚Äôt want me to act different or baby him or some shit so I asked him if he would feel better if I brought it back in my room so I did. Now it‚Äôs on the table under my tv, his back is to the pouch and table and I‚Äôm standing in front of him. We‚Äôre making out, and after about thirty seconds I pull back, and it looked like his other hand was behind him, so I pointed it out and grabbed the pouch thinking he took some. He got mad that I assumed that. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he did or not, it was zipped but he may have already done it. Whatever. When he leaves I put my shit in my bathroom. So when he came over today I don‚Äôt know if he went in my bathroom... but I only had four bags when I looked just now. I feel like I would‚Äôve seen how little I have for sure.
So I took Tagamet at 8:18. Dosed about ten minutes ago. Used my four bags. I‚Äôm sweating but don‚Äôt really feel high... fucking sucks.
I‚Äôve been going into withdrawals about 24 hours since my last dose. And now I‚Äôm out. He should be stopped... so I want to stop with him. Be a healthy couple.

So my endoscopy is in a week from tomorrow. If I don‚Äôt use again, should I still tell her I have a heroin addiction but haven‚Äôt used in a week? Since the withdrawals will probably be present?

I won‚Äôt ask for withdrawal at home tips  because I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs tons of threads about it. Maybe links, unless you wanna give me some advice. Or actually if anyone can link me to a good kratom website or give me a good strain.
As far as things I have, I have Xanax and weed and Advil I might be able to get some tramadol from my grandma but stealing from my sick grandma is kinda fucking shitty. I also have gabapentin , I just don‚Äôt know how to dose it. Any drinks I can buy? 


Update. I asked him. He took half of my bags.
He used them

I told him he fucked me over
He said I fucked him over

A couple of years ago I was studying for my Masters degree in London when suddenly I had to take a year-long, all-expenses paid sabbatical at the expense of Her Majesty‚Äôs Government, owing to the happy discovery of about a kilo of weed, an ounce of MDMA, a bit of coke and several thousand dollars in cash at my flat. Since then, I‚Äôve being working on a book about the international war on drugs that‚Äôs taken me all over the world ‚Äì I‚Äôve recently got back from the Philippines, where President Duterte is basing his approach to law-and-order on the Saw franchise.

Unfortunately budget and having used up all my vacay time means I can‚Äôt visit the US anytime soon so was hoping some of you fine folks can help me out. I want to write a section on the opioid crisis in America that‚Äôs exploded in the media in recent years and was wondering if people here would mind sharing some of their stories? I‚Äôm interested in hearing about: Oxy, fentanyl; how, why and what you use; how taking opiates has affected your lives; the dangers and ODs; the policies under Donald Trump; and any stories or anecdotes you might have.

I‚Äôve been verified by the mods and I don‚Äôt wanna get any personal info that can get you in hot water with the cops, busybody moms, etc. Goes without saying but lets keep this in the rules!

So just to begin: What‚Äôs your poison and how did you get started? ;)

PS: Stories from Canada also welcome!

I‚Äôve had the shittiest luck lately.

I was real dopesick exactly  2 weeks ago and right after I scored, I totaled my car on the icy expressway. Still was sick when I crashed, and I panicked and threw all the dope away. Of course the cop that showed up was cool as fuck too and would not have tried to search me. Just my luck.

Well my cousin‚Äôs been driving me to cop lately and today he picked me up while I was super sick. I get these weird stomach movements when I‚Äôm sick where I‚Äôll throw up stomach acid. These urges are impossible to fight like I can with normal puking sometimes.

Of course I didn‚Äôt wanna throw up in his car, so I went out the window. First time I went out and all the stomach acid just went straight to the back window -_-
Second time, my glasses flew off in the wind onto the highway.

I guess it‚Äôs not even as much bad luck as me just being a dumbass. My glasses have been loose and fucked up lately and missing one of the nose pieces, but I figured I‚Äôd put off getting them fixed as long as I needed to. Looks like I‚Äôll just have to get a new pair now. Lol. Fuck.

And the worst part of this all (of course my junkie mindset tells me this is the ‚Äúworst‚Äù...)
is that the real strong dope in my area is gone. And the dealer is lying and saying he has it even though his stuff sucks now.

I am afraid the temptation to bang one just to see what it's like is becoming more irresistible. 

so... on the off chance that i do decide to do it, can i get some tips regarding dosage / anything else you think might be important. i will google how to prep but i want to get some first hand suggestions from you guys as to dosage for a first timer with low tolerance. 

i have been using seeds for the past couple of years fairly irregularly so i have not developed much of a tolerance at all. 10-20mg of oxy typically gets me to where i wanna be with the ones i have at the moment. 

i have 10mg instant release capsules. how much of one of these should i use?

i have done my research on the addictive side of IV so if you want to warn me just know that it might be a waste of energy. i really just want to make sure that if i do do it that i don't take too much and have a bad time or die. but on the other hand if you feel strongly about trying to persuade me not to do it well go for it i won't mind.

one reason that i am fairly confident that i will be able to control my use is that i do not have access to more pills once these ones run out. it's very hard to come by without a prescription around here and i do not have friends who fuck with this shit

its clear now that i am a lifer of opiates, after having tried quitting suboxone after being on it for thirteen years, 9 years straight.

I brought my dose down to 1/64th of an 8mg tablet.

7 days later the withdrawal and pain oonly got more intense.


Around this time my TMJ continued to get worse and worse and worse.

So at this time i am most likely going to make the switch from suboxone back to a regular ass opiate that actually kills pain. Suboxones pain killing effect is more along the lines of masking the pain not actually getting rid of it. It does an awful job at it. For very minor things, yes, Suboxone acts like the motrin of Opioids, and same to the intolerant, its proably grandiose. I digress: ITS NOT USED FOR PAIN.


I ahve been in pain for 6 years straight. I have tried countless meds, and therapies. Opioid treatment , something id never thought id be doing, is my last option. 


On a daily basis i feel like my head is being crushed to sum it up. I have extreme jaw pain that radiates into my inner ear canal and through both my upper and lower jaw as well as their teeth, causing my teeth to crumble.

I have not seen my primary doctor but 2 time as i am kind-of afraid of both doctors, and doctors dismissingme because i am on suboxone. I have had this happen before and it makes me want to cry because you feel helpless. Most doctors do not even care, once they realize that you take Suboxone. One even told me this outright.


TL;DR



**What is the best opiate for jaw/facial pain**

**wat is the best opiate combination for jaw/facial pain i.e. if it comes with tylenol, motrin, or something else like naloxone (which in the right proportions actually INCREASES the efficacy of the drug,.**


**...i dunno what to do anymore**


suicide & death have been on my mind a lot because i am in constant pain. 

i love my life and i am a very positive person but i cannot take the pain. 


i would love to me admitted to the emergency room , to have a stay over night so they can properly address my meds & help me with my pain  , but i do not know if this is even possible.


Thank you for reading and have a beautiful day",1518873886.0

I'm 20, and I happen to have a few 10mg Oxycodone pills at home. I'm super curious about the drug's high as I never experienced anything other than weed or alcohol. 

I'm considering trying it but I'm also worried about the obvious addiction risks. Basically - **How good is Oxycodone?** Is it like heroin - when you do it and you *know* this is the best feeling you will ever experience in your life? Will I be like ""wow, life is boring now""? Or is a one-time use not that bad?

How addictive is it - from one time, assuming I have access to more pills, will I get physical cravings?

I hope this isn't pissing anyone off - I know opiate addiction is not something to fuck around with and I'm not here to offend anyone. I'm just really fucking interested and at the same time I'm very prone to addiction so I'm hesitant.

7y5zhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7y5zhs/wowsnorting_tar_is_strong/,10,https://redd.it/7y5zhs,Wowziersgray,Wow...snorting tar is STRONG,"Honestly, I‚Äôve always thought that tar was a waste of money even though it‚Äôs half the price per gram as ECP (moved from east to west).  However, I recently mixed my tar with glutamine powder with a ratio of 1:1 and GOD DAMN GOD DAMN, it‚Äôs beyond surprisingly strong.

I‚Äôll link a pic later of the lines I was doing and what it looked like, color wise.  

But yeah, I mean tar is $80-100 a gram for the good stuff where I‚Äôm at, and I bought 3 grams for $220. I have no tolerance as I haven‚Äôt partook in 7 months.  Smoking it, as I had remembered, took around a point to produce some good hits and a discernable high.  However, I did the pill bottle penny technique using a point of the tar resulting in 200mg of 50/50 greyish heroin.  I racked up a small, 30-40mg line, and within 5 minutes I was buzzing hard.  And the high lasted twice as long as when smoking.

Yeah, it stung a bit but, really, nothing too bad.

Now I love tar! It‚Äôs so freaking cheap!  Again, I got 3g for $220 and using the 50/50 cutting, it produces 6 grams of really heavy hitting snortable heroin!

It‚Äôs still tar, so it‚Äôs still less of that euphoric and energizing high that I got from ECP, but it‚Äôs a fraction of the cost and has longer legs.

Anyway - the reason for this post - has anyone else had this experience?? That when snorted, tar is crazy strong and even cut, is just as potent by weight as good afghan powder?!

My only guess as to why is that Mexican tar is rarely cut heavily due to it‚Äôs strange texture and is typically more ‚Äúpure‚Äù in terms of percentage of general opiates because it contains like three or four more things than just heroin (diacetylmorphine).",1518863923.0

I'm aware there are other threads for this kinda subject*

Relationship background;
-2 year duration
- Lived together for 1 year so far
- Heroin addicts
-Happy couple until recently

Story;
  This all went downhill the other day when a man was basically cussing us out because we parked on his side of the street. Because we were carrying, I did whatever I could to leave ASAP. ""I called the cops and gave them your plate number. Don't park in front of my house!"" My girlfriend, barks back and he calls her a bitch. I tell her to get in the car to leave the situation NOW.
  Apparently, I'm a pussy because I didn't get out of the car and engage in this dude's drama. Sure, I understand her point, but my pride isn't worth a felony, because we had dope on us. This is followed by hours of arguing, which is not usual for us. Eventually, it gets heated to the point to where I snapped, out of character, and snapped her phone. Immediately, I regretted it. 
   So now, I'm in the doghouse still 3 days later. Today started out rough. I haven't been overly apologetic, but I did tell her I was sorry and that it would never happen again, which I meant. She thinks I've done a bunch a dope without her (not true) which makes me a selfish boyfriend. I replaced her phone. Also, she was dopesick while brutally ripping me.
  This evening she finally lightened up a little bit. I bought some dope and copped some cash which seemed to put her back to her normal self, somewhat. ""Babe"" calling was coming back, a couple kisses.....but she has still lemme know she hasn't forgot. Basically what I'm asking is, does it sound like I may have a chance? I've been as truthful as I could in this thread. I love her so much, I can't imagine a life without her. Our relationship isn't always bad like this, it's just been a rough week.",1518856186.0

The snot is flowing now, a thousand floodgates cranked open. Bearded men with wooden leg prostheses roaring through the tempest of crashing mucoid waves, Melvillian characters stoically braving the storms of early withdrawal. Chills, sweats, restless legs ‚Äì it‚Äôs all par for the course and you really shoulda learned last time God damn it. In this numb nuts‚Äô mind, the term ‚Äúdopesick‚Äù never did it justice. It‚Äôs more than a mere flu spin-off, it is concentrated despair, waking up to bells tolling gloomily in the distance, it is you scrounging for all the obtainable firstborns in ripe sacrificial age to propitiate the dope gods.


Timidly breaking through however, like a frail sun on a cloudy day, our sad excuse for a protagonist surmises The Meet, where he will be given The Remedy. The Stop - the doors groan open with a vaguely flatulent hissing sound and vomit passengers on the platform. Our quote unqote hero whips through the masses with the verve of an overzealous conquistador in a New World jungle. He hooks lefts and rights like a rabid rat in a maze; his lizard brain has taken over and the route requires no cognitive effort anymore. On a nearby corner, he spots his dealer and can you believe it this pathetic worm actually does that thing when you see someone you really like at a distance and automatically start smiling awkwardly and start focusing your vision on the floor or a point behind him not daring to fully commit to meeting the other guy‚Äôs gaze until the final moment right before the hands shake.


Like ripping off a band-aid, the idiot leaves with dope in hand. Now to go home. Now to unlock the door carefully and nauseously giddy and place the works and product on his desk like a deranged priest preparing Communion. Now to probe for a vein, now to feel the subacoustic pop of a needle and observe the crimson flood streaking through the barrel, the knucklehead in awe at the resulting color.

I've kicked cold turkey for days many times so I know this is no where near what the suffering *could* be. But, as anyone who's tried a taper knows, when you decrease your dose by a huge percentage, you definitely friggin feel it.

And the mindfuck element is so brutal. Having more sitting right there, that I'm saving for the rest of this taper... bags of freshies, sterile saline, shit to do...

The biggest mindfuck of all, the part that really makes me hate myself, is that today on day 2 of half dose (well first went down from .7 g to .5, and now day 2 of .25), I actually physically feel... ok. Not great but not really very sick anymore. My body's acclimated. But my mind... ugh... I don't even have such bad depression as I did yesterday.

Put it under his dresser that he always puts it under .  Then I waited a couple of minutes tried to wake him up for about 10 mins he finally woke up we did the rest . He didn‚Äôt even notice how little there was lol. Now he‚Äôs asleep and I‚Äôm nodding out writing this post . Judge me if you want but I think I did what I felt was right .

I can only use one hand (the left) and I cannot do shots in my thighs because of the insane muscle spasms in my legs.  I shoot 1ml.  I only use brand new rigs and needles and I always use alcohol prep pads to steralize the injection site and to sterilize the vial.  I use 2 different needles 1 to draw the med and the other to administer it.  

Now I'm have *severe* pain in the front side of my shoulder.  It is excruciating to lift my arm up.  Here's the rub... I didn't do any trama to my arm.  The god damn thing is a fucking paperweight.  I only have 1/4 feeling on that side of my body and for me to feel this much pain is I have no words.  This pain is in the arm I inject into... There is minimal swelling on the side of my pec nearest my armpit.  Can this be the beginning signs of infection?

My doc gave me 12 T3s for 9/10 level pain and an antibiotic....

Understand, I have a mechanical aortic valve and take blood thinners so this tooth isn‚Äôt getting pulled for at least seven days. That means over a week of living with a throbbing painful puss filled mouth blister and only codeine to comfort me.  

I took eight T3s over a period of three days and called her yesterday when my pain spiked again. I was in tears and left a message which she returned just before her office closed. She said she‚Äôd send a stronger script to my pharmacy and made an appointment with a dentist in the morning. 

I jumped in the car and high tailed it to the drug store only to find 30 more T3s waiting for me. I was fucking irate. That bitch played me.  

Fast forward ten hours, 4am and the right side of my face is swollen and my head is on fire. I‚Äôm pacing the living room, waiting for 8am to come so I can see my dentist, while imagining horrible death scenarios involving my physician and writing sharply worded letters in my head to her, her boss, the FDA, the DEA...

Despite the unmanageable pain I‚Äôm  really trying to TAKE THIS SHIT AS PRESCRIBED  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE but I breakdown and eat about six of the T3s no CWE and an hour later, I fall asleep. :)

Morning comes and the dentist says the tooth has to go, which I already knew. We get to know one another well enough during the examination that on my way out the door he hands me a script for twenty 5/325 Percocet. 

I fucking love him, but I suppress the urge to hug him and head back to the pharmacy, for a third time this week where I‚Äôm lectured about the dangers of combining Codeine and oxycodone but I know better. 

The counter of this pharmacy is decorated with antique glass drug bottles, some with original contents still intact. I always mean to snap a photo of their counter to post here because this the only place I know where it would be appreciated as much as I appreciate it.

I know Codeine is a pretty shit high compared to others. 

I‚Äôve used a hand full of opiates over the last 5-7 years mostly oxys, percs and Ds even smoked dope once or twice (never used a spike and don‚Äôt plan on it) but usually really low doses compared to some bigger habits, I never developed a habit or really used on my own would just snort Roxie‚Äôs and Ds, eat the percs because I didn‚Äôt want to fuck my nose up with all the extra shit.

Anyways wondering what you guys would think a good dose is? I did like 90mg today but I felt sick from some bad food I‚Äôm assuming or something because I had a head ache before I took them but I ended up with an even bigger headache and pretty buzzed but I regretted wasting a decent high. Still have more though. Felt weak and almost nauseous really. I know that can be common but essentially was wondering if that was too big of a dose or should I assume it was feeling shitty earlier and leave it at that? I know it would only be assumptions but since you guys have probably dealt with this more than I have I found this sub to be appropriate. There‚Äôs always good harm reduction here. I‚Äôm mid 20s 140-150lbs male if that helps you guys. Is 90mg with a reset tolerance (months without a pain killer smoked a tiny bit of H, like 50-150mg in one day and got sick as fuck it was nice dope) too high of a dose for someone my size? I‚Äôve been told 100mg max starters and other told me they‚Äôve done 200-300mg and that seems like ENTIRELY too much for a first time tolerance situation, you can always take more but never take back what you took.

Tüïñüïó LüïòNG DIDüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èNüö´T RüìñüÖ∞Ô∏èD


When should I take sub before/after getting high? I know it‚Äôs no problem if I just stay on the sub, but I‚Äôve been skipping a day before I get high. I won‚Äôt have PWD, will I? The bupe is prob still in my blood, right? Then I can just dose more sub when I‚Äôm done getting high. Also, more specifically, I just sniffed 2mg. Going to get high tomorrow (and the next few days). I actually feel pretty decent. Should I save the other 2mg powder I had crushed up then? I don‚Äôt wanna block the precious heroin tomorrow night lol


 So I‚Äôve been on subs legitimately for a little over a month now. Did about 30 days totally clean of other opioids, did have a little crack binge and I‚Äôve been messing around with powdered etizolam like a GENIUS. 


I wasn‚Äôt really against doing drugs, I actually quit for my gf at the time who then dumped me literally the day I got on subutex. Yeah. Came home after all that to find a $410 settlement check I wasn‚Äôt expecting and didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve (thanks Adderall XR!) and somehow I STILL didn‚Äôt go out and relapse. Because my mom was the other thing keeping me clean.


I really only need my mom to THINK I‚Äôm clean though, and I‚Äôm on fucking prescription opioids anyway. We‚Äôve always been kind of don‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell and now that she found out about the heroin problem she‚Äôs doing more asking. I still have plenty of time and resources to do what I love, though, which is to get high on heroin and cocaine. 


Everyone esp online made it sound like I wasn‚Äôt gonna be able to get high, or like if i could it‚Äôd take a whole gram shot or something. Well, I happened to skip a day before I saw my boy, he racked me out two fat rails of ECP and also passed me, a few times, a sweet little handheld dab rig that worked really well for tar. Pretty much heaven for this ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù junkie who went from all day everyday to being able to actually wait and save and get high like I really want, when I deserve it. I‚Äôm learning how to be a functional deviant. It‚Äôs pretty amazing, really, because even two months ago I wouldn‚Äôt consider not doing what it took to get high each and every day.

Anyway, I wasn‚Äôt really ON sub when I got high before, but I was enough to not go into PWD when I took the sub again later. I anticipate a little more blockage this time because I‚Äôll have dosed around 30 hrs prior. Should I take small amounts of bupe each day while I‚Äôm on this little vacation? I‚Äôll prob be getting high about 5 days in a row. Is that long enough that I‚Äôd have to do the whole sub induction thing again?

I need your help confirming if this is a Naltrexone pill or not. It was a free gift from an online friend among other stuff, but I haven't used it for months because the lack of markings bothers me. We're not in contact any more so I can't ask him where he got it from.

One side is scored and the other is just plain no markings.

Has anybody ever seen or used an unmarked naltrexone pill? Perhaps it's from a country like India and came in a blister pack, hence why there's no markings? I'm only even considering it because it is orange, the proper color, and because I'm using it for ULDN. If it's inert or something else entirely, I doubt 0.2% of the pill can cause adverse effects.

Thoughts? I know I could just buy more, but if the blister pack tablets are unmarked then it's likely legitimate.

Can I drink while on 15-30mg of oxy? The blues... Not percocet or anything with Tylonol in them.

Im thinking I will prob take about 20mg of oxy and then in 3-4 hours start drinking. But I know at some point in the night ill have a craving to take 15mg of so. Im thinking ill prob end up drinking like 8 beers or so. Im 300lb 6'1.

What do you all think? Am I gonna die or end up in the hospital?

I dont really drink often. Only drink beer really. ",1518818071.0

I was arrested the other night after picking up I stopped at a gas station and before I could even go inside I set my gps and texted back a few friends, i go to get out and 2 cars roll up blocking me in and hit me with flashlights, they told me to stay in the car and came up to me asked me why I was there and I said I was going to get something to eat inside then get gas on one of the pumps, they asked me to step outside and they searched the car and found a bag of loose dope and 2 more stamp bags, they brought me in and I didn't say anything to them. I was In this holding cell and kept asking what we were waiting for and they said my charges were pending, hours later they finally say they got them and it's two accounts of possession. They booked me and then I was told I had a bond of 2,500 and someone had to bring 250 but after my buddy that I had called and left a voicemail with called back they said he could pick me up and they would just give me a promise to appear so I just had to show up at court and my buddy didn't have to pay a bondsman. 

I was arrested when I was 18 for possession and I went to court and the district attorney told me he was giving me a pre trail drug education program to take and it was 15 classes I had to do once a week and then I would have to do 40 hours of community service and come back in a year and I would get it dropped, I did that and they dropped the charges, I never had to take drug tests or had probation so I never really stopped using, it was on and off for a while then a long break until 6 months ago I started using heavily again. Im 20 years old now and the court date they gave me is for 2 weeks from the arrest date.

Now here is what's freaking me out, I've been checking pending convictions online every day and they just showed up yesterday and they didn't charge me with possession they charged me with two accounts of possession with intent to distribute. They never told me this and I'm scared shitless because Possesion is just a misdemeanor here and with intent is a felony so I have 2 felony charges pending against me. My dad left years ago and my mom isn't really competent so I'm on my own with this one. I would get a lawyer but I can't afford one, last time I was at court they said I wouldn't be offered a public defender because i didn't need one, I'm guessing they will probably offer one to me this time

I'm just really scared because I'm still pretty young and I have wanted to stop this shit for a long time but I'm afraid of what the outcome is going to be and that I'm going to have a felony for the rest of my life and that would fuck me up majorly
Any advice or expiernces of getting arrested with these charges or anything similar would be appreciated immensely
Thank you so much 

TL;DR I am 20 years old and was arrested with two accounts of Possesion which is what the cops told me but later found out through the judicial website that it's two felony possession with intent to distribute charges, what should I expect to happen and is there anything else I should do? First court date is in 6 days ",1518818025.0

You were depressed, or had some form of ptsd or life trauma that pushed you to drug use, yet every single person who has gotten clean for more than a few months says that they‚Äôre finally ‚Äúhappy again‚Äù or whatever, that it ‚Äúgets so much better when you‚Äôre free from your addiction.‚Äù How is that possible? To me, that‚Äôs like saying that someone who is suicidally depressed can just pick up a heroin habit and when they get clean all their previous problems will have disappeared. I guess my question is how exactly do you mean you‚Äôre happier? Is it just that with an addiction you still have the same problems so you go from bad to worse and going back to just bad feels almost normal then? Or does getting clean somehow really allow you to be happy again?",1518815519.0

I took about 3 mg over a few hours on Wednesday. I took about .5 at a time, because I felt like it wasn't working. I think I may have had somewhat of PWD's- it wasn't unbearable, but I did not get well from the sub. Whatever, toughed it out, and the next morning I took about 1mg, maybe a little more. It worked, but again, I still didn't feel 100% like I usually do when I take sub. Later on in the day I took about 2mg before bed, and it still didn't get me fully well. I woke up not even 12 hours later feeling restless and kind of sick.

So, this morning I took about 1mg. I STILL didn't feel that good this morning after that sub. So I've taken about 5mg over the past few days, so it's obviously in my system. 

I don't know why the induction has been so rough- it's never been like this before. Usually I am good after 1mg for a whole day. But I don't know what the problem was this time. If I had PWD's, I don't see why 48 hours later I would still not be feeling relief from sub. 

So, today, I ended up getting some dope. I did about a bun and a half over the past few hours and I finally felt relief. I didn't think I would feel the dope after all that sub, but I did, and still do. 

Now, my questions are why I had such a tough time inducting, and how to avoid having this problem tomorrow. I want to continue taking sub, don't want to use, but today just happened as it did and that's that. I know that I want to stop so I am not getting discouraged. But, I want to know if I should still wait 24 hours til I really feel sick, or if I can just take sub when I wake up to avoid having cravings and all. I obviously have sub in my system, so I'm wondering if doing dope and getting high was just luck, and that sub is still going to be attached to my receptors and I won't get PWD again if I take it after 17-18 hours when I wake up.

Can some people with clean time or even former people with clean time talk me thru this a little? I was doing so well for longer than I ever have before (~3mos on 2-3mg sub) and its vanished in a blink. I'm starting to tell myself I'm just going to die to this. 

How much long term damage can I expect to deal with? I know it'd probably take years off everything for my brain chemistry to be somewhat normal. 

Just anybody share some stories please. I can't think about what I've done and where its going to put me moving forward.
