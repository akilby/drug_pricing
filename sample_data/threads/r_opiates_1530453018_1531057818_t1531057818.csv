Ok so the last post I made was about the closest person in the world to me dying. And me and my other best friend are prettyyyyy sure for alot of reasons that he didn't accidently overdose, he did it on purpose and it was spelled out for all of us we were all just I guess too busy with our own shit to notice until it was too late. So yeah, I've been having a pretty difficult time with the grieving process you could say. When he died, I had already been using again really heavily for about 5 months and it was bad, like really bad, but it got so much worse after he died. At least a dozen fent pressed roxis a day, which is a shit load of fent where I'm from. I got arrested for the first time and all my family and friends wouldn't get me out because they were scared I was gonna die. Fast forward a month of being in jail where it was easier to get high than on the streets, and I get bonded out out of nowhere by a person the bondslady said wishes to be anonymous. Ok cool. I thought things MIGHT get better bc jail really sucked and I never want to go back buuuttt that was kinda a pipe dream. 

I get real fucked up for a day, buy a shit load of pills, and go back to rehab the day after I got out of jail and brought enough pills to ""taper off"" and clearly that didn't work. I leave after a month bc I was still getting high everyday anyways and move in with this girl I'm friends with, whose also in love with me, who also does pills. I get super fucking bad off again and really strung out with these awful looking track marks, I'm still not even properly greiving, I hardly ever even know which way is up I'm so high all the time, and i decide I need to make a change because I was going to end up dying. Really. So I make arrangements to move back to my home town an hour away i haven't lived in in 3 years with a friend I've had for over a decade. I basically cold turkeyd off pills and I've been off them for a few weeks now. I don't even have anything to say about detoxing anymore really. It's the same everytime and it sucks but it passes. 

Now here come the real reasons why I'm so bitter now and I'm really gonna bitch.

A My family and I are on extremely rocky terms at least, well everyone except me and my mom. She's great and I love her so much but she really has no clue the shit show that my life has really become. Granted, she hasn't seen me except for a couple times this entire year so that helps. My family still lives here so it's complicated for me to move back here. My dad is basically the biggest asshole you could ever imagine, and I haven't spoken to him since shortly after Nick died and my father said that he got what he deserved, and I'd be the next. Thanks, dad. I hate to admit it but i'm a very very emotional and needy person so being at odds with my family has always really fucked with me. 

My friend that i moved in with has always been one of the chillest and most understanding people I've ever met, even though he's not an addict. The mother of his 2 year old son overdosed and died at the beginning of the year on heroin 3 days after she got out of rehab...so he knows grief too. Well he has decided he is in love with me after we legitimately had a big conversation about that never becoming a problem if i moved in with him before I came. I'd pay rent and be an awesome roommate and we'd continue being friends like we always have been. He was ALL FOR IT. Now he's gone and made shit all awkward for me as I have to continuously make it clear that while I appreciate his help and friendship more than I could ever say, I'm not trying to be anything more than friends with anyone anytime soon. I just can't right now y'all like I'm hanging on by a thread here as is, I haven't been clean that long, and I'm half crazy still from all the shit I've been through. Honestly tho how fucked up in the head is he to want to be with someone whose obviously not current dating material like me? It's just so frustrating. 

So me and my best friend of well over a decade, J, who was also Nick's best friend start hanging out regularly again since I've moved back. He's not an addict but he's still handing Nick's death as badly as me and I truly believe that there is no one that this is harder for than me except for maybe him. We were Nick's real family. We were each other's family. The three of us have been through more together the last 12 years than anyone could ever imagine. J is the only person in my life and in Nick's life who can say they stuck around from the very beginning of our addictions, until the very end in Nick's case. He witnessed the chaos that was our relationship when in active addiction and listened to all the bullshit every single time either of us ever called him. During the periods that Nick and I would break up and not see each other for awhile, J never once took sides and always loved us both equally. We both have lived with him at some point, both together and individually. He bailed Nick out of jail both times he was arrested for drugs and let him move in with him for as long as he wanted. J has fought fiercely for his friendship with us for as long as we've known him just as we have for him. Nick's mother, who is literally the most horrible woman I've ever known, made it very clear that she never wanted him and sent him to live with his grandmother at a young age and his millionaire dad left while his mother was still pregnant and was never in the picture until much later. I've been at odds with at least my father for the better part of my adult life, sometimes my mom too, and have never felt like a part of my family. So ultimately I think me and Nick always looked to J for guidance because we didn't really have anyone else. But since Nick died, it's all J can do to fend for himself and I get it because I feel the same way. It is so hard though to see him like this though and not being able rely on him for a solution on how to just feel better. Or even just feel okay, I'd even be thrilled with that. He's always been able to help me fix things but he can't fix this. We're basically just clinging to each other for whatever small amount of comfort or support we can get and basically holding on for dear life. It's just like why can't I just stop thinking about how sad I am or what I could have done differently or what Nick's voice sounds like or about that one time we got lost and stuck in the mountains for 6 hours because we were drifting like dumbasses or about how his little brother is doing? Like seriously people die all the time and I don't really see other people greiving at the level that I still am 3 months after their loved one dies. I mean really, i haven't really ever seen anyone ever openly struggle with a death as badly as I have so that means one of two things. Either they're just really good at hiding it and I'm not or (and I think this is the more likely of the choices) I've finally hit my breaking point and I've just lost all ability to properly deal with anything and everything life throws at me, dooming me to this severe depression and anxiety for the rest of my life. Probably mostly due to severe drug addiction and trauma lol. 

Guys I just feel like I'm never gonna be ok. These are just the major things driving me crazy right this second, but there's so much more little shit going on too and I just can't handle all this bullshit at once. No one that I talk to or try to talk to really get it's except J, and i can't burden him with my shit too. So, I usually hold everything in for as long as possible and frequently have a range of minor to major meltdowns because of it. Not even trying to be funny, but I've seriously questioned my sanity more in the last two weeks alone than I have the rest of my life put together. Maybe I've finally cracked man, idk. Fear is a constant companion of mine now... I'm scared the majority of my time now. Of everything. 

If you've made it this far congratulations, you're almost done lol. This is the last bit of my rant is the real root of how godawful I'm feeling these last couple of days and it's just because I royally fucked up like i always do and why I'm really so mad and sad and broken and betrayed feeling nonstop these last few days. 

J and I ran into Nick's grandmother, the one that raised him I guess 3 days ago now. She'd done so much for all 3 of us over the years that J and I decide to buy her a few bottles of nice wine to drink with us (she drinks a bottle a night at least and has for as long as I remember) and go check on her. WORST idea we have ever had to date i think. It was probably necessary for us to finally get all this pain out in the open like we did but we should not have done it there. We tortured ourselves, going to where Nick lived for years growing up and even randomly throughout adulthood and where we had so many memories with him everywhere we looked. But we felt obligated to Nick to check on his oma because she had to be hurting too. We ended up drinking 4 bottles of wine together and talked about Nick for the better part of 5 hours. Alot came out that Nick had lied about and some of it really broke my heart even more knowing he lied to even me. We also pretty much verified that yes she also knew Nick had done this on purpose. 

So we leave and I'm drunk as shit and all fucked up in the head and I'm going to hang out with an old hookup buddy I used to have that I used to get high with because I'm not going home to deal with the bitch ass there. We go get some dope, I do 3 key bumps of it to try it and that's the last thing I remember (around 10pm) until I guess you can say i finally came to at 530am. I od'd so bad that my dude I was with that I mentioned, who I've always stayed super tight with, said he looked over at me in the passenger seat of his truck after I'd been out there waiting for him to come back out so we could go home and do more dope for about 10 minutes and I was dead. He narcan me 3 times and does CPR and brings me back. He doesn't wanna bring me back to his place super fucked up and anyone see me and start some shit so he just drives around with me I guess sleeping in his passenger seat if that's what you call it?? I don't fucking know. But he said he had to make sure I kept breathing because he had to stop 7 or 8 more times to do cpr again. Coming to was the most bizzare experiences of my life. I've never been so close to death and while nothing has actually changed everything felt different. That fear I've always carried with me multipled.

As if that of isn't bad enough in itself, i somehow threw my back out. I'm 26 years old and I literally can't even walk hardly because I actually threw my back out. It seems as though everything bad happens to me. On top of the constant debilitating pain that's the worst I've ever experienced everytime I move, I have been unable to sleep a wink since the od, 72 hours ago. I've dozed off a couple times for probably 2 of those hours max. I am so fucking uncomfortable I want to scream and I officially have developed the worst attitude I've ever had just because I'm now not only am I emotionally destroyed but I'm in the worst physical pain I've ever been in too and can't even manage to sleep through it. I literally don't want anyone even coming anywhere near me, touch me, or even really talk to me except for a select few people. I'm being such a bitch to everyone because the pot is finally boiling over--I'm so fucking mad at everyone for every stupid reason you could possibly imagine; my family for not being there for me, Nick for leaving me, my roommate for falling for me, J for not fixing the way I'm feeling, and as if that's not enough, that I threw my fucking back out!! I'm so fucking sad too though; that I lost Nick, that J is hurting, that i feel do doomed, that everything in my life has changed so much. Life just sucks so bad right now and I can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel... I didn't quit drugs to be miserable still and have my life be even more chaotic than before. 


Ok I'm finally done I got it all out....I think. I'm cringing at how long it is lol but I had to get it out or spontaneously combust. I'm gonna smoke another blunt and try to fall asleep again since I can't move from my bed anyways. Fml. If literally even one person read it all the way through, thank you so much for giving a shit enough to care for a couple minutes while reading what I had to get out. if not, at least I got it all off my chest for my own wellbeing.

So, apparently it's a documented fact that people can overdose from their usual amount by being in places that are unfamiliar to them . As if the brain prepares the user with some tolerance as it knows what is coming in familiar scenarios. 

&nbsp;
To me, this sounds absurd. The only mechanism behind the pgenomenon I can think of is adrenaline.

I am British and I smoked some weed once in America when I was 16 when I met this girl on vacation and I was TRASHED. Way beyond anything I have ever experienced. I was a heavy smoker with some tolerance under my belt before I went. This was like going back to the first time. I had munchies so badly I was getting potatoes out the trash and eating them in front of her mother who was trying to ask me what England was like and I COULD barely strong a sentence together 

It could have just been very love t weed, but I've still never experienced anything like that and I came across some very strong bud in the years following that encounter.

So, it could be true. I've never experienced it since and I don't know whether that counts. But I felt completely lost while I was there. I ditched my family to hang out with a girl and got to see the every day non tourist side of Arizona.

Personally, I don't see how this could happen to me with heroin as I'm almost always outside, in weird places, scoring down unfamiliar roads, using odd public toilets, meeting strange people. The whole thing is unique despite being in Groundhog day, getting up and trying to stay well. But, being abroad is about as unfamiliar as you can get. I had a friend come stay with me from Florida a couple years back and we both shot the same amount of the same batch. It didn't affect me at all, I thought it was garbage, no rush, no euphoria, barely got me well. But it knocked him unconscious for 45 minutes. I thought he had died when he fell off my bed sitting up with it still in his arm so, maybe it happened to him.

Anyway, I just wondered if anyone else has experienced this phenomenon or has any ideas about it. ",1531045359.0

Three. It may not be long for some, but to me, I’ve just had this epiphany tonight at 1AM, in the midst of WDing, that I’m not letting this ‘disease’ or whatever the fuck others may call it fuck with me; I consider it a bad choice I made at the time, but I’m done with all the bullshit.


I’ve slowly built back the trust with my mom who I’ve always had a shitty relationship with before even all the drugs came into the picture. I’m finally reconnecting with her and the rest of my family. The other day as I came home after copping a couple bars to stave off withdrawals, she came home soon after and told me how I’ve been such a good daughter to her (not knowing that I’ve relapsed on heroin months prior). This made me think about it constantly of all the shit I’ve done and said to her and everyone dear to me. So now, I’ve decided this will be it. 

Journey’s gonna be rough, but at least I’m not alone anymore. I also have a boyfriend who’s been very understanding of my situation (we’ve been on and off for almost 6 years now) who doesn’t fuck with that shit, and I won’t drag the people I care about or anyone else down with me any longer. That is all.


I wish you motherfuckers all the best, and it’s been a long and bumpy ride for me. I’m sure I’ll have lapses in judgment in sobriety here and there since I ain’t perfect, but I really hope to Satan that if I ever go to hell, he’ll at least give me props for not causing anymore grief to the fam and my loved ones. Cheers.


PS Any recommendations to stave of the mental cravings will be a huge help for me. I’m a huge anime/JRPG junkie so yeah lol. Or maybe something a bit more productive and outside my ‘comfort’ zone (mostly sedentary lifestyle) is appreciated as well...or idk go out for a change and do something

I take a empty paper towel roll stuff it with dryer sheets that smell delicious and then take a black trash bag and wrap the paper towel roll in it with  a little sticking out.

switched from pills to dope a few years back and split 1 - 2 grams of powder per day with my girl, who smokes it. about a year and a half ago I developed a nasty nasal infection and it's just gotten worse. sometimes the mucus that comes up is like rubber or even as thick as cheap plastic sometimes. almost clogged up 24/7, often takes 20 minutes just to get a nostril open enough to get a decent sized bump up. most of the time I just snort my bump up into a bunch of fucking snot. seems like fent-heavy dope doesn't clog me as bad but that could just be coincidences. some weeks are better than others and some kinds of dope make it a little easier but it's pretty much a daily battle. sometimes I'll get a wide open nostril and get a bump up, which gets me way higher than when clogged obviously. it sucks because I'm basically wasting dope and nothing is worse than losing dope when you're already a struggling junkie. 

I've tried everything - drips, sprays, inhalers, netti pot, spicy shit, hot shower, snorting, blowing, massaging, you name it. shit sucks. my breathing got so bad one time we went to urgent care and got some antibiotics, a 5 day supply. those gave me huge relief but 2 days after they ran out I was back to dying. recently got other antibiotics from a family member but they're not strong enough. made 2 other unsuccessful returns to urgent care (nodding too much had to leave one time, no real relief other time) but hopefully I'll get time to go back again soon to get the original antibiotics that worked. 

so I'm hoping one of you guys here on Reddit has some kind of magical fix for junkie nose. anyone dealing with something similar?

I know this question might be better suited to /r/methadone but I don’t really know anyone over there. And I trust everyone here to keep things real.

Mostly I just lurk here these days, I’ve got 19 months clean now. I’m asking for my exgf. She’s an addict but also has Stage 4 ovarian cancer.

Anyway, being an addict, she left some methadone with a friend to hold before her UA at a new palliative care doc. You know how it is, you’re afraid you’ll take everything you have and then be screwed for the UA.

As expected, shit got fucked up. Friend’s husband found the methadone and took it. Now exgf is facing a UA at a brand new doc with no methadone in her system. She’s moved to a different state, has no connections, etc.

And she’s terrified that she’ll be cut off from pain meds and have to die of cancer without anything to ease her way.

I know everyone always asks “how can I pass a drug test when I’ve got shit in my system?” but I’m asking the opposite.

Does anyone know how to make a UA read pos for methadone when there’s none in her system? I know that’s a crazy question, I swear. 

The alternative is for her to cold cop and I just can’t tell her to take that risk. Tbh my brain is sorta frozen here, it’s such a messed up situation. Before she got sick she had three years clean, so she’s way past knowing anyone who could help out.

This time, I decided to treat myself. I bought 1g. (Done it before a few times, this isn't a first.) For the last two days I've been snorting as usual, but half an hour ago I fucked up, and IMO put a bit too much in the line.

After 5 minutes, I start to 'come down' as I like to call it. All is good. However, things soon start getting more intense. It feels like I have to force myself to breathe, which I've had to do before, but this time, properly force myself. Deep breaths. My heart actually went /faster./ I started getting light headed and dizzy. I start getting pins and needles around my mouth and my right arm. 

I stand up, walk around, do some push ups to focus on something else - but these symptoms get more and more intense by the minute. But then, at the 30 minute mark, they all fade in about a minute. Now I don't even feel that high, and I'm certainly not nodding like I usually do when high.

Well, in 2014 something very unusual to say the least happened in my country. 24,4 kilograms of oxycodone (along with 780 grams of marijuana and 50 ampules of some non especified barbiturate) was hidden in a false bottom under the car seat of a 38 years old man and it was seized by police. At first, the white powder was suspected to be coke, but the test was negative for cocaine. Eventually, it tested positive for oxy.

This is fucking strange not only because the guy had kilos and kilos of powdery oxycodone, but because of the country in which the
drug was found too. There is no opioid culture in Brazil. It's almost impossible to find dealers selling street heroin here, and if you want to do H in this country, the way is buying on the darknet. Very very few drug users know what oxycodone even is. Yet, there is this dude with 24 kilograms of powdery oxy under his car seat. What the fuck.

I.e. is it a good therapy drug for opiate cessation?,"Hey! Hoping someone sophisticated enough to read chemistry search results can confirm or deny this for me. I tried to google it. 

I ceased use a couple days ago -- still on the far side of acute withdrawal but feeling great! Often I'll take kratom for a week or so to help with Restless Leg S / sleeping, as well as General achiness and pain. From what I understand this is necessary because my Mu and Delta opioid receptors are screaming out for something to latch onto, since my endogenous production all but shut down while I was addicted to opiates. I believe Kratom agonizes solely Delta receptors -- hence why it provides comfort without euphoria and has a lower abuse potential. 

Here's the thing -- a friend with epilepsy from whom I was begging comfort meds (sorry Lilo!) offered me some of her Gabapentin/trade name Neurontin. Said it would help me sleep. She said it's off-brand use is for neuropathic pain and treatment of RLS. 

Now I was reluctant to take anything I don't really understand its mechanism of action -- especially some seizure med. But not that reluctant lol! So down the hatch it went. 

45 minutes later I get serious tingles all over and some relief from that tension in my calf muscles (which is maybe the most painful and annoying part of recovery). I know this feeling, I think! That feels like Delta activation! And since I hadn't slept in days I went out like a light. 

So... It seems possible that Gabapentin agonized at least some opioid receptors in my brain, but I'm basing that purely off my subjective experience of it. And I was surprised since it's not an opiate. 

I'm too dumb to figure out whether that's true or not factually. Can someone confirm or deny based on the actual chemistry / mechanism of action?

In any case I found Gabapentin to be comforting while in late acute withdrawal, it helped me finally finally sleep.  So add that to the list I guess. 

And if someone can confirm the MoA maybe it's something people who are hooked up with a GP can request.

He opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.

“Can you get anything?”

“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”

“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s next door in my room.”

In 10 minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook-up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.

I had not shot up heroin since I left San Francisco, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs made it feel like an elephant was stepping on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in Tracy’s garbage can.

Long term (two years of being clean or so), what are some habits and thought patterns that develop over time to cope?

How did your personal philosophy change pre- and post-using?

How do you deal with boredom and waiting now? Did always waiting on a dealer make you more patient?

What are some things only former users can really get? (Like the whole uncontrollable jizzing from hypersensitivity when coming down, the constant fear of dope sickness, etc.)

What is wilderness therapy really like? Did it help? Hurt? Insider criticisms?

I lost my job because my coworker tried to fight me over some dumb argument about sidework and corporate fired both of us because of it. I didn’t do anything wrong, I just got caught up in a bad situation. 

My bf left me at his house all alone yesterday to run some errands and I ended up smoking the rest of the gram we bought. He used $100 given to him by his grandma and I only threw in $20 of my own cash since he owes me at least $40 from the times I’ve bought for us. (EDIT: I didn’t smoke the entire g, we had smoked most of it the night before but had about a point left. That’s what I smoked while he was gone, we probably each smoked half of the g in total.)

Since we were re upping later that afternoon I thought it’d be okay if I smoked the rest. When he came home he was super upset, he refused to talk to me which made me sob uncontrollably and then kicked me out while I was trying to nap because his friend was coming over.

Now I’m at my parents house feeling withdrawals starting up, no job, only $20 to my name, and possibly no boyfriend either. I’ve isolated myself from all my friends and haven’t really talked to my family in months, I’ve just been coming home every so often to get clothes then going back to my boyfriends.

This sounds dramatic but I am fully prepared to off myself if my boyfriend actually breaks up with me. He’s my only friend right now, and he’s my only way to stay well if he decided to still share with me. But he’s so angry with me over smoking his dope (that I genuinely thought we were sharing) that I don’t even know what to do. I’ve apologized a thousand times.

So I missed a big shot of dope a week ago, Friday night I think. I still have a lump in my arm, it's gotten a bit softer. The area is red and slightly warm to the touch, not as hot as it was a couple days ago though. I circled the lump with a sharpie, it hasn't grown in three days and remains the size of a silver dollar.


So while it hasn't gotten worse I'm still worried. I mean a simple miss would be gone by now right? Yet here the lump is...

What should I do? I bought subs and took a break from shooting up since I don't want to compromise my immune system right now (might be overkill). Do I wait for it to get worse and then hit the ER? How painful is draining it? Is this even an abscess if there's no streaks, temperature increase or excruciating pain in the area?

I fucking hate myself.

So payday was today, and my hours amounted to 99.45 for the past two weeks, but because I work for a disgusting fat cum-stain of a human, five were lost cause I smoke a cigarette or two a day, while the other 14 that should've been overtime were paid in cash while shorting me eight bucks, which is small, but it's the principle.

And that motherfucker didn't give me my hour breakdown until I bitched, at which point he provided a falsified breakdown so that it looks like he ain't robbing both me and the IRS, if I were to go to the labor board.

Cocksucker tells me to take it or leave it, and I mean, it's not like I'm not gonna grab bulk tonight. 

Everyone says, ""Damn CPTKO, I can't belive you've worked were so long. Why do you stay here?""

And it's like, cause I need this. I'm almost dead inside from it all. I spend damn near every cent I make numbing myself, in the past having my girl spike me in the parking lot, and now smoking on the way and back from deliveries.

I hate myself for being in this situation, working for an asshole who's destroying a once successful restaurant that I love, and letting him fuck me financially the whole time.

I hate busting my ass just to be shit on. It kills me everytime that fuck treats me like nothing. Putting in all this time when I could call my parents and beg them to cover my tuition to get my associates, at least my time would mean something and id be better off and in a better situation. Course then I wouldn't have enough money to stay well and get through the classes. 

At the very least the cooks tell me I wouldn't even get over 40 hours in another restaurant. That I'm better off taking it raw than fucking off somewhere else.

About a month ago my hand went numb. Thought it was carpin tunnel because I code about 8-10 hours a day. Then my other hand went numb, followed by my feet and toes. This was over the course of a few days so I knew something was up. I went to the ER and before I know it 5 doctors are surrounding me; drawing blood as if they wanted to suck me dry, got two spinal taps, 5 MRI's, and wasn't discharged until 11 days later. They prescribed me with 20mg percs to take three times a day, Tylenol #4 for in between perc doses, 1mg Klonopin to be taken three times a day, 1000mg roboxin to be taken as needed, 1000 ml B-12 shots to inject myself every morning, 20mg adderrall to be taken twice a day to balance out the drowsiness, and a shit ton of vitamins. 

So I'm waiting outside the pharmacy smoking a cig waiting on my medication when a dude approaches me and asked if I had any benzos on me, I still had about 30 on me left over from last months supply so since I was about to get another 90 I decided to help the guy out and gave them to him for free. He refused to take them for free and offered me cash but I insisted. He felt bad that I wouldn't accept his money so he offered me 2gs of H (he must of been a dealer). My eyes lit up bc I always wanted to try it. I agreed to the trade. He asked to exchange numbers but I refused bc I didn't want an H connection incase of addiction. I have syringes for the b-12 I can use but I still don't know how to properly inject. I decided to just snort tonight (it was good but I stilll want to experience the 'rush' everyone  talks about). 

So my question is can someon tell me hw to properly inject? ( Don't worry I wouldnt take my other meds with it.)

If there was ever a pain patient I'm the postrer boy. I spent a couple years going to shady doctors to get my script (480 mg/day of oxy). Then one day in 2014 I shattered my leg beyond recognition. They couldn't even get me into the ambulance after a mainline of 100 mics of fent. They ended up jamming 40 mg of ketamine into me to knock me out. Long story short its taken over 3 years and 15 surgeries to get to a place where my leg is working. well over those 3 years I supplemented with dope in between surgeries. Even in the hospital post op they were giving me 8 blues a day, a mg of hydro morphone IV, and 15 mg of K every couple hours. its been just about a year since my last surgeries. I wrecked 2 mini coopers driving around on benzos and opiates, became a drunk. 2 DUIs and none of them involved alcohol...

Anyways, last fall i decided fuck i, after 3 weeks of withdrawal I went to the methadone clinic. I was on 190 mg/day when I quit cold turkey in may. for the first couple weeks I felt decent. then bam full blown w/d. that went on for a couple more weeks. I 've tried to use kratom in the past to no avail. but for some reason this time it actually helped. I used it pretty steady for a few days. Now the bag is just sitting in the cupboard And I'll use it for PAWS. I think quitting alcohol helped a lot. I make bad choices when drinking.

So anyways thats my story with the dancing with the devil. Plenty of ODs, paramedics giving me narcan, friends doing the same. But I'm on the other side now, and it feels really good. I'm motivated, back in the gym, strengthening my leg, I can feel music again, along with cool breezes. Life is actually worth living again.

The dentist I went to is some older lady (late 40s / early 50s) in a conservative rural area of the Midwest.

Finish the procedure and find out I'm getting fucking Tylenol, that's it. So once I figure out that I'm not getting vicodins or anything that actually gets me high, I told her this.

""Listen , I understand that you don't wanna jeopardize your business by giving out too many opioids given all that's going on. But I think it's ridiculous that I'm only getting tylenol for something that's really quite painful. I don't know who's fault it is, but its silly and most people I know have gotten something that actually works to treat pain after similar procedures.""

Her response: ""Tough luck kid""

Now I was expecting something measured, defensive and reasonable but knowing that I'm not gonna get any drugs combined with this bitches attitude kinda set me off.

My response: ""Haha, well you know what? Luckily I know some friends with older relatives who will sell me their oxycodone and fentanyl patches! I'm also gonna go buy some weed once I get home."" (my state doesn't even have medical yet)

Then she gives me the shittiest look I think I've ever received. Like she wants to poison me or something. 

I didn't really catch all of what she said next because I was kinda woozy, but it was basically a mini-rant about respecting the law, buying scripts is illegal, drugs are bad blah blah blah. I was reminded of the Mr. Mackey teacher guy from South Park saying ""drugs are bad mmmkay"". Then she shooes me away and I pay then leave. 

I kinda feel bad for being shitty about it but doctors need to understand that opiates are cool and much more useful for treating pain than fuckin tylenol & advil. Imo addiction is a responsibility issue that falls on the user alone, not some doctor or random pharma company.

I know what it's like to be that sick and I know it sucks. I'm so sorry, bro."" And then he ended up giving me 2.5 grams for $20 less than I usually pay for 1 gram. Before he showed up, I really felt like I had given up hope. I knew in the back of my head that he was different than that though.

Long time lurker, first time poster under a new account but I had a quick question because I've been searching Google for 24 hours and keep seeing differing information.

I've been taking between 360mg & 450mg of Oxycodone daily for a LONG time & my buddy wanted to get rid of his new script of 30mg G77 Oxymorphone for super cheap so I said, ok, to save money.

Every post I see about Oxymorphome says 4.5 x stronger than Oxycodone if taken intranasal and 2x of taken orally. So I can do basic math here but then there is a 50% increase of taken around the time you eat and a possible 70% to 300% increase around alcohol.

I see people saying that doing a single 30mg ER is TOO MUCH even for someone with a tolerance and that doing even 3 of them a day is potentially lethal.

I wound up spacing 3 out over 24hrs just doing 15mg here and there but never felt anything but was able to get some sleep.

Now am I just being TOO careful here or with my insane tolerance of Oxycodone would doing a single 30 mg oxymorphone er be typical to the normal 3 to 5 30mg Oxycodone dose I am used to doing at one time?

There are just so many stories of people saying 10mg of Oxynorphone floored them but no one says what their ACTUAL tolerance looks like.


SHORT VERSION: I typically do 3 to 5 30mg Oxycodone at a time for a total of 360 to 450mg a day. How much Oxymorphone ER 30mg G77 am I looking at for a dose and daily total? 

Thanks for clearing this all up!",1530935919.0

The other opioid crisis is when we can't legitimately get our prescriptions for our legitimate pain. The doctors shoot you down when you complain of pain. 

All they want to do is send a script for some anti-inflammatory. I have kidney and liver damage, but they refuse to give me something that won't make the damage even worse.

People in pain have the right not to be, and I think it's malpractice when a doctor doesn't help you to a reasonable extent. Even more often I've seen older people taken off their meds cold turkey, and they want to die because of the pain.

I don't and have never lied about my pain, but the doctors think I do. Hell, they can hook me up to a lie detector and ask if the pain is real.

TLDR:
The medical system has gone to hell, doctors won't believe how much pain you're really in. It's a sad, sad world.",1530935869.0

Another month of pooping everyday to the point where I have to sit down to piss, no joke. And due to a high-but-still-somehow-low tolerance, cutting my strips to not be sick and project vomit all over the floor. Mainly just a ride until my 20 80mg oxy capsules pop up (pack ofc, photos will come) from the dwm's. 

Which brings me to the ever-lingering question. So, if I accidently take too MUCH suboxone and I'm puking all over the place like the exorcist. Will Narcan help or no? I'm asking because I have a pouch of it and I'm wondering if that would help in such an extreme predicament. I know that traditional anti-nausea medicine doesn't really help because I have a strong power of suggestion, and thus can continue vomiting essentially losing the Zofran. The only way I'd know for sure it would work would be to IV some Zofran. A hospital may do this, given suboxone's 24-hour half-life.

Also found kratom and benzos (benzos weren't his DoC).. looks like maybe he was detoxing himself at some point..

It's been confusing because he really seemed clean. In twelve step program, he was the life and helped so many people. No matter what, he had learned to love in a special way unlike anyone I know (unconditionally basically).

Just confusing.. apparently he had been really really skilled in the past at seeming to be doing well and being functional, using without a sign.

I'm confused about how he could do that so well, and also love recovery and that life and be so genuine in so many ways, yet have this thing going on underneath. I think he was dissappointed and didn't want to dissappoint those he loved.

A kinda fucked up thing (among others) about the 'program' is that it becomes such a lifeline and a community of loving people that we're afraid to lose it... Some people just cut you off if you relapse... Makes me sad to think about it.

If anyone has thoughts about how you can maintain a lot of genuine quality of interactions but still use I'd love to hear it.

Or thoughts about just how painful it would be to have to live a double life but love the better part of it.

Or thoughts about whether it'd be at all possible for someone with a serious history of addiction to just use once or twice, detox themselves, and then use again months later.. kind of hoping that's how it went.

(Kind of related, I'm also wondering if anyone ever uses kratom and benzos to get themselves through a dry spell, not just detoxing. :/ )

(Heroin & Ketamine),"I’ve dug around reddit quite extensively, along with the usual interwebz sites and haven’t found  much info on, what I’m calling a Kittyball (heroin & Ketamine.  Probably because there are very very very few people that IV Ketamine.  I find there are 2.5 types of people out there when it comes to K. (1)  don’t like it at all, will even turn it away when it’s free. (2) these people are more than happy to accept that free spoon/key you offer them (and will generally seek you out an hour later for another) but rarely, if ever, have their own. (3) - where I reside - absolutely love it. Understand how to dose themselves properly for the given situation.  Seldom can k-hole, generally due to residual tolerance and/or knows Ketamine is the most fun, most euphoric, most weird by flirting with the hole but never entering it,  I would much rather have a few drinks and do a few bumps of k than a few bumps of Coke (either at home or at a bar) any day of the week!

So what I’m looking for is basically dosage recommendations for mixing dope and k in the same shot (I have done k IV more than a few times, all were incredibly euphoric and enjoyable).  But I am assuming, in the same manner as a speedball, since the drugs will synergize each other...dosages will have to be modified appropriately.  (My current Ketamine tolerance is very low but my current dope tolerance is pretty high, shooting 3-5 bags of very good quality, what you would call ECP (from the southern part of the tri-state area).

Maybe balling them isn’t the most optimal way? (Slash would like to shoot coke until it was gone...as that’s what happens when you shoot coke hahah, and use dope afterwards...though I’ve heard some people prefer to use dope then coke.  Personally I like the POW you get when balling them...nothing quite like it in the world).
Should I back off the dope, use even less Ketamine IV (which when done alone is already quite a small amount).  

Any experience, insight, links to pages I may have missed, etc would be of great help...and when all is said and done will share the experience with the fam.  ",1530863777.0

Ever since then I had not been able to stop thinking about that amazing heroin experience, up there with my first high purity meth experience.

My whole life I've been able to find connects for ANY drug I've needed but opiates were the one thing that always alluded me -- could never find a steady connect. I always thought this was a blessing in some way.

Here I am, graduated and working in a big city and finally I stumble upon an H/occasional oxy connect. Been using at least a bag (0.1) a day with some oxys, xans, coke, etc for the past 2 months. I realize I'm becoming totally addicted now. Money is not an issue which somehow makes this even worse but my connects gone missing and I'm running out of my stash very fast.

I had a bad abscess drained - full anasthesia, 4 days in hospital. Unfortanately, the surgeon left dead tissue in my leg which almost lead to gas gangrene.

Since then, I have been dealing with a spreading and recurring infection in my leg. I have been hospitalized 6 additional times for 46 days total and have had 4 additional surgeries to clear up the infection. Two of the wounds created since then are right on my left and right groin - each about 1.5""×6-7""×1.5"" deep. Bad area for wounds - despite going to wound care and taking copious amounts of antibiotics, they have repeatedly gotten reinfected.

Needless to say, I have been dealing with A LOT of pain. There are plenty of bad days when I can barely walk.

Unfortanately, pain control has been a major issue. While I am in the hospital, I am usually good. They have good hospitalists where I go and knowing my tolerance and seeing my old charts, they usually give me 20-30mg of Oxycodone every 4-6 hours + IV morphine or hydromotphone for breakthrough pain.

When I get out though, I am screwed. Thus far, I have been sent home with scripts ranging from 20 800mg Ibuprofens or 12 5/325 Percs to at best, 24 5mg Oxycodones or 12 15mg Oxycodones. Since they are hospitalists, I cannit follow up with them. Wound Care will not prescribe narcotics and the three primary care doctors I have seen have AT MOST given me a couple days worth of 5/325 Vicodins or Percocets.

Part of the issue I know is my ""checkered"" medical history. But I am in LEGIT pain - any doctor can see the GAPING wounds and if they look at my chart, they can see this is an ongoing issue. Even so, it would take me 6-8 weeks just to see a Pain Management doctor.

In addition, the state I live in just passed a new Opiate Epidenic law. Non-Pain Management doctors cannot prescribe new patiebns more than 90 Morphine Mg equivalents per day. They use a 2:1 ratio, so that is ONLY 45mg of Oxycodone. Scripts cannot be for more than 5 days and some pharmacies, like Wal Mart, have their own policies not to fill scripts for more than 50 morphine mg equivalents (that is less than 3 Perc 10s per day). While their are exceptions to the new law, the state makes these doctors jump through 20 hoops to get there. It is asinine.

For the past 6 days, I have been in the hospital AGAIN! I had my two groin wounds re opened and the re infection cut out. Cue more pain!

As such, I was shocked today. The doctor I have beem seeing in the hospital was real cool - PLUS he has his own practice. Even though it is risky for him to do so, when he discharged me, he actually spent a couple hours jumoing through the state's hoops and gave me a 7-day prescription for 20mg Oxycodone to be taken every 4 hours. I have no intention of abusing this - I only want to be pain free or at least have manageable pain.

Plus, I am able to see him in a week - he made the appt and told me we can work together to manage my pain until my wounds are healed or this ordeal is over. That could easily be another 2-3 months. Even so, I am BEYOND HAPPY to have a TRUE AND COMPASSIO MNATE doctor - for the first rime in months, I see a light at the end of the tunnel of this ordeal!!!",1530846237.0

When doing my research, I found no report about how much it hurts when snorted! O God, a cough any eyes full of tears. So I started IV, but tolerance build fast and I've tried up to 37 mg IV and didn't get an awesome rush. I kept reading reading and found that a lower pH helps with water solubility. I IV'd with some  acetic acid from vinegar, with better results, but nothing extraordinary. 

So, as snorting hurt so much, I decided to prepare **sloth water**, which is a similar acidic solution to ""monkey water"" with this unique water soluble benzo.

I am experienced in using Ketamine intramuscularly, and while I went through a brief phase of chronic use-until-its-gone, I ultimately moved on from that.

Furthermore, this morphine is something I want to have on hand for my adventure bag, in case anything goes wrong in the wilderness and I need something strong to keep my head on. 

So my question, is this advisable for a first timer? I am what you would call a drug nerd, I am not a fiend but I use considerably more than a non [user.](https://user.So) So assuming I get some of this morphine to have on hand, and I try 10mg IM while I'm on vacation, is it really likely that I develop a habit?

The difference between heroin laced with fentanyl and regular heroin is HUGE. fent heroin lasts for around an hour, and is wayyy more intense, stronger, and more euphoric. after 1-2 hours, intense cravings begin. after a day of doing fent dope, I find that the next day I an extremely stressed and on edge. the only thing I can do is get more.

REAL HEROIN comes on nice and SLOW. it is NOT intense. it is a very mild and warm LOADS of itching. these effects can last from 6 to 8 HOURS before cravings begin.

Honestly I feel like fent is the crack form of heroin, and cocaine would be regular diamorphine. I do like heroin more even though it is less euphoric. much more pleasant. most stamp baggies in the southeast are a high concentration of fentanyl and have hardly any diamorphine.

I've tried everything since joining the no fap movement. Therapy, salt peter, replaced all my pornography with gay porn, I even got the series of piercings known as ""jocobs ladder"" done and topped that off with a urethra ring. My cock looks like it got in a fight with a staple gun. 

All the piercings did was keep me from beating my meat for a couple weeks then i was back at it and it feels even better than before! Every time I get horny I just try thinking about my dead grandmother but even that doesn't work. If anything I cum harder. 

My most recent attempt to try and kill my libido was starting a regimen of oxy contin. While it's fun, it did not achieve the desired results.  I decided to add opium into the mix to try and potentiate the oxy- so I ordered a vapor genie and some fresh opium off the onion farm.  If anything these opiates just make me hornier. 

Everything I try backfires and just ends up making masturbating better. 
 
This needs to stop. I used to be a normal guy who would just jerk off to Mia Khalifa taking a good dickin' down. But in my attempts to stop I've just become a freak. An overweight drug addict with a bunch of cock piercings, jerking off to two dudes butt fuckin' while he thinks about his dead grandma. 

What have I become? ",1530822750.0

SURPRISE!
My doctor decided all by herself, without contacting me or speaking to me in any way about it, that she was going to try to wean me off of tramadol.  
She stated that since I'm on gabapentin now, that I agreed to take that and wean from my pain meds. 
Except I've been on gabapentin since before I signed that bullshit contract. 
I gave her my blood, peed in a cup and signed a contract and she just decided that she was going to wean me off of it all by herself. 
I'm in a disgusting amount of pain. 
What to do about it that is legal I do not know. 
She was wrong, she knows she was wrong, yet she refuses to admit she was wrong. 
One moment I'm feeling 1000 times better, cleaning my house, caring for my kiddos and playing with them again, painting and swimming and going to the gym. 
The next moment, I'm couch ridden and distraught because I have lost all quality of life again. No I need an Ativan.

We never knew what caused her to swerve. 

This past week I was going through some old documents and came across the toxicology report from her autopsy. I had read it before and had talked to the coroner, but I did not at the time understand the drug levels and the coroner did not mention them. The report shows that she had:

hydrocodone .24 mg/L
carisoprodol (soma) 4 mg/L

From my googling, .24 mg/l of hydrocodone seems like a massive amount... up to 6x the therapeutic dose, and within range of a lethal amount.  I know that much depends on indiv tolerance, etc. 

Is it possible to know what .24 mg/L in the blood translates to in terms of number of 5mg vicodin tablets?

And is the effect of hydrocodone impacted by the presence of Soma? 

Am trying to determine how reasonable it is to assume that the cause of her death was related (even if in part) to the meds. 

Any input appreciated.

... I haven't been an active member in the sub for long, but from what I can tell, you're all fuxking awesome & honestly support each other- So I thought I'd bite the bullet & just ask...

I had a close friend since I was 13, though he lived in America & I'm in Australia - we were in constant contact for nearly 20 years....

We shared so much of our critical development together - it's safe to say that I loved this precious boi like a brother.... (he taught me so much, about- so much.... esp drugs, eating disorders & mental health issues)- I talked & gamed with him through withdrawls, & episodes of self harming, we'd talk all kinds of shit at all hours.... he truly was my best friend, someone I could be 100% honest with about *everything*....

.... he struggled with ED's,  as well as addiction & depression /anxiety... We supported each other through some crazy suicidal moments...

He ended up fathering 2 little girls (with 2 different but amazing mums)- & he loved them so much... so so soooo much.... They brought so much live, joy, peace, innocence, happiness- just- all the good things babies bring , into his life <3 I know they meant more than the multiverse to him...

But he was a mentally ill addict =( & he eventually lost his life because of it.... 

I am devestated for the loss of someone I love & relied on so much, but I am even more devestated for his daughters....

I want them to know that their daddy loved them more than anything ... They are growing up so fast, & their understanding of the situation is no doubt going to change too....

Sorry- I guess what I'm trying to ask you folks- is- 

What would you say to children/young kids who lost a parent who was a suicidal addict??

How do you help make sure that they never feel like it is their fault / they weren't enough to keep daddy around?? (Kid logic is crazy)

I know he loved his daughters- beyond everything! I don't want them to *ever* feel like daddy loved drugs more than he loved them...

 I watched him struggle, fight & suffer so much over the years... - & once his daughters were born, whenever he spoke about being suicidal - we would talk about how his little girls needed their dad around- He tried to survive... he really did... 

Kids shouldn't have to bear the burden of their parents issues - but they've already lost their dad, I just want them to *know* even more as they grow up - that they are worth living for- & his death doesn't mean he didn't love them enough to live for them....

God I hope you guys understand what I'm trying to say here.... ='(


I'm sure plenty of folks in this group have lost friends / family - have any of you had to talk with kids about it?? 

*any* words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated  <3

If anyone read this far down, Thank you <3

8wceic,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8wceic/how_methadone_has_helped_me/,8,https://redd.it/8wceic,nodsquadlife,how methadone has helped me,"Tldr- I found a clinic that has dispelled all the horrible things I heard about clinics.

I used to never believe in addiction, I had many friends who went too far, several died and I still chalked it up to a mistake or lack of control.  I fucked around with all sorts of drugs including opiates and never really had any issues I couldn't handle but 3 years ago I got in al car accident where I herniated discs in my back.  So pain management became a part of my life.  

Then back in October my doc told me about how federal laws were changing and that he wasn't going to be able to continue prescribing my meds and talked about referring me to a pain clinic.  I had at this point started buying pills and heroIn and formed a fairly problematic issue with opiates.  I looked up the pain clinic online and it was horrific review after horrific review about how you're treated like a criminal and how expensive the visit was.  Went in and it did feel like I was on trial.  In addition to how much each appointment cost they had a ton of others things they wanted me to do that also would cost a small fortune none of which was covered by my insurance.  I was telling my friend about it he told me about the methadone clinic he went too and how awesome it was.  

Now I heard the same thing about clinics that I heard about pain clinics, that you were basically treated like shit.  I told him what the hell if I dislike it I'll just leave and go the pain management route.  When I went in I was shocked at how much this methadone clinic helped work with people like me.  There were a lot of patients there because of pain management as well as people who were not.  Not that that matters to my clinic, they treat everyone with the same respect.  I was shocked at how kind they were and understanding.  

The methadone after I got to my therapeutic dose took away the cravings to the point now where I haven't abused my pain pills that I still get for flair ups, my muscle relaxer seems to work better as well. I've even slipped up a couple times and used heroin and they didn't get angry or phish me, just supported me.  All of my doctors and therapist are all working together and overall I'm in a very different place than I was six months ago.  I was pretty scared of my health team being mad with me for hiding stuff but they are all have my back and that feels good.   I know I'm lucky in this respect and that this is not how it goes a lot of the time but my hope is that My experience becomes the norm.

My uncle just had his pcp tell him he wasn't going to be able to keep prescribing him painkillers and he went to a pain clinic and they put him on methadone.  He is having a completely different experience then me and it's not pretty.  His experience has been similar to the terrible stories you hear.

I know my clinic is kinder than most, smaller than most and has helped me more than I can really say.  They are all about harm reduction and letting you have the say in your treatment.  They have never been mad when I have tripped up, only supportive.  I hope more treatment and clinics go this direction because I don't feel like a criminal there, I don't feel judged there and that has  allowed me to come to terms with the change in quality of life that I wasn't dealing with.  Anyways love this sub and its accepting, supportive and caring community.  I think anyone wanting to work in the field of addiction treatment should actively read this sub as it has so many insight into addiction and more importantly the people who suffer from it. 

Hope y'all have a good one, I wish you all the best where ever you are, however you are,  you are beautiful, maybe beautifully broken but beautiful none the less. Thanks

We are on good terms and I do him favors sometimes; you know, shit like pick up his lil brother for an extra bun, etc. He once called me his nigga and I really took that as a compliment... that was a pretty sweet day hah. Like my street cred leveled up or someshit.

Ok so my question is, would it be weird if I asked my dude if he knew any “legit” prostitutes that I could meet? I have cold copped in different hoods safely and successfully...so I’m sure if I really tried.... I could cold cop a hoe. BUT I had this great idea to just ask my dude. Has anyone ever asked their dude that? Would it be weird thing to ask? I don’t wanna lose the “my nigga” street cred..... or my connect.

tldr;
Can I ask my connect if he can set me up with a hooker who isn’t gonna rob or kill me? Bonus points if she looks sexy and doesn’t make my shit drip drip drip?

P.s. Of course I only had this 💭 recently.. and just today or yesterday my dude got locked up on some dumb shit... child support or whatever. So I currently go through his wife who is also super cool and nice to me. Actually.... maybe she might know better than him right? She is a girl and all, and girls definitely be gossiping.. that’s just facts. But yeah I could always just wait til he gets out and ask him instead.

Alright thanks hope everyone has a great day!",1530784549.0

I'm no stranger to drugs, with that said, I'm looking for advice on a situation with a friend.

SWIM is 25, been using (injecting) heroin amoung other drugs for an easy 4 years. Beautiful girl in a hard spot. I've made my feelings known that I like her, and I would be interested in a relationship but only after I see her cleaned up and imptove her life.

I would like to help. I don't want to get used, and my life is much more stable and too busy to even try to deal with her issues on my own.

I was informed the Ex-boyfriend has been hit with assault charges amoung others from a recent fight they had. I am fully aware I only got half of the story, her side. I'm thinking, good for you, as a friend, no one deserves to be abused & it's an important step for her to change her life and cut out toxic people. I'm highly encouraging she cut people out, change her phone number and start fresh with new contact list for a new life.

I've mentioned a addiction treatment facility as an option. Of course She'd rather do it herself. She told me she's been on Suboxone for a few days. I'm not sure what this entails, if it could help her or hurt in the long run. Needless to say it's not prescribed. 

I think this girl is really awesome she has a two bedroom apartment to herself - but I don't even want to know how she affords it. I want to see her do better, be clean. I'd even be okay if she got clean and didn't want to pursue a relationship with me. I'm only interested in maintaining a relationship or friendship with her if I see life changes. I expect to get hurt, because I know how terrible addiction can be.

I was considering offering to take over her rent / watch her cat / stay at her place for a month, if she would check into and complete a 30 day opiate addiction program. I feel like the only way that would work is if everyone is supporting her from me, to who she wants to call ""friends"" and her family. If she goes for it when I discuss it, I'll deffinitly push to meet her family members and get them in the loop as to what's happening, that she needs help and I'm willing to do what I can.

I am aware of the dangers of enabling. She hasn't asked and I will not give her money. I don't use hard drugs myself and I don't want that around in my life. She's an awesome person, and I would like to see her recover.

What should I expect?


I'm not sure if she has any kind of health insurance, worst case, what would be a ball park estimate of treatment cost for 30 day inpatient care?

Links to non-profits or treatment centers would be appreciated.

Any tips in dealing with the concern that she's relapsed, if getting clean ever becomes a reality?

Is it possible to wean oneself off of opiates and eventually stop the hard drug habits?

It's a struggle every day, when you start recovery it really never ends. She inspires me to better my life & I'm pretty solid and in control of my situations, goals and what not, but how can I inspire that in her?


Thanks for any replies.
The most obvious one is GTFO, but I have found myself willing to try to help if only briefly and very firmly.

Especially in that little round indent on the flat part of the cap. Figure all 60 prob got me iono .1-.15 hard to measure since it’s just smear on each but it took 5 cotton tips to get it all. 

Anyway I felt no rush but can swear I felt much better almost instantly. I’ve been taking just enough sub that I’m not puking/shitting but don’t have much and thought my direct deposit was coming through today till I realized it’s the 4th (been mostly in bed for few days except for a 2 am bike ride last night as I’ve been half sick so sorta spaced the back holiday thing - though real banks won’t touch me with a ten foot pole anymore I guess green dot works the same since all deposits go through some federal system)

I guess the reason for post is do you think I’m good to take lil more sub if needed before my pay clears ? As I’m pretty sure that shot is felt even with slipping out for a second luckily I was using a lot of water so as to get cottons clean as possible.

I got super lucky and landed an amazing job in a casino where I am responsible for more cash then I have ever seen in my life lol. Kind of crazy. I do miss the old days sometimes. Especially when I realize I have no friends, normal people are the worst. They are super shallow self seeking cunts. I hope everyone is well, nodding, and blessed on this beautiful 4th of July. 
On to my question. I came across a bag of for gun powder months ago. I have kept it in a dark air tight vial. It’s about a G. I’m just curious how long people think it stays active for. I’m guess at least a few years. I’m pretty sure it takes at least 6 months from being produced in southern mexico to reaching my city so I’m not really sure.",1530745122.0

Preface: 

I’m in my early 20s, a straight A student living with his girlfriend, and starting his second year of business school (I plan to go into accounting). I wasn’t always doing this well though. I had a heroin addiction from around 14 yrs old to about a year and a half ago when I met my girlfriend. At first it was sporadic use, whenever I had money, but as I got older and made more money it progressively got worse, eventually culminating when I got a large insurance settlement a few years ago and really went off the deep end. I met my girlfriend near the end of that money when being sick was now something I had to worry about whether I could afford to fix of not. She had done drugs but never anything heavy and hated my heroin habit but never said anything because we weren’t dating yet. 

After a few months of us hanging out and me progressively heading downhill she showed up at my house sobbing in the middle of the night saying how much I meant to her and how she couldn’t stand seeing me like this. If I wanted to have anything with her in the future this had to end now. Ok. I really cared about this girl and honestly did see a future with her so I did it. Went and flushed what I left down the toilet (oh fuck me did that hurt inside), told her okay I’m ready to make a change, and calmed her down to sleep. 

Now luckily enough this lined up with me leaving down to go help set up a new location for the company I work for. I knew I’d have to leave town to really have a shot at being clean and was looking at this like a paid rehab. Oh fuck was it bad. Being sick in an I heated building during  he middle of winter.... fuck me. I died for the first week, but managed to keep my shit together enough to get work done and after that it got better. (I’ve never gone to an actual treatment facility, but did sober myself up for periods over the years so I knew what I was in for. My idea was always cold turkey or nothing, what’s the point in being sober if I still need to take something to be normal. No everyone’s route but it’s what worked for me). 

When I got home after the location had opened I knew I couldn’t go ham out with most of my friends or I’d relapse. Of course this happened anyway. Twice. My girlfriend found out both times (I didn’t hide anything when asked about it). At this point we were planning on moving to a different city together to go to school and she told me if I was going to use again that she would not be living with me and that our relationship was effectively over. This hit me hard because I had really fallen for her at this point. I did it. I fucking did it. I cut all the people off that I knew I’d use with and just put my head down and worked to save money for the move, which went off without a hitch half a year later.

The fucking bag in the elevator: 

Fast forward a year and a half. We’re both going to school, doing well, and living on our own for the first time in a new city. Of course like any couple we have issues occasionally, and sometimes with the added stress of college we can both be a bit on edge, but we both love each other and generally work things out. This was in the middle of one of those tense periods. She was at work till late and I was just getting home from a late study session. 

I get in the elevator and press my floor, looking around the elevator as I always do when I notice a baggy sitting in the corner. Naturally I pick it up. I kind of hid it in my hand till I got in my suite Incase anyone else got it the elevator but I already knew what it was just by looking at it. Once I was inside one quick smell of that disgustingly delicious vinegar scent and I knew I was fucked. 

I had been doing everything I could to avoid it. I didn’t communicate or see any of my old friends that used, I kept as busy as I fucking could, I avoided anywhere I thought I might encounter dope. I DID EVERYTHING I FUCKING COULD HAVE TO STAY CLEAN. And here in my elevator on my home I find a goddamn bag of dope. Fuck me. 

You know I did some. How could I not?  It had been so long, I wanted to so bad, and it seemed like it had found its way to me instead of the other way around. Foil, lighter, hootie, dragon, hold, exhale. Fuck. It was so easy. My brain didn’t even work during that half a minute. Not a single thought. But after I exhaled and sat in my bliss for a few seconds it finally did. 

What about your girlfriend? What about your career and education that you have so much time and effort invested in now? What about your life that you’ve managed to turn 180 degrees in past two years? I felt horrible and ashamed of myself. I had worked so hard and it all just crumbled within a minute. 

So before I smoked the rest of it to suppress my guilt I tried to do the right thing. I called my long time friend who has known me since before heroin took over my life and has always supported me through it (and who coincidentally was coming to visit me the next day for the first time since I’d moved). I explained the situation and was met with two words : flush it. “How is it even a question?” She asked. I don’t know, it just is. It’s so hard to explain. She said “hang up the phone, go to the bathroom, and take a video of you flushing it and then send it to me.” I hung up, took another huge dragon because fuck it I had already messed up, and went and made the video (oh fuck me did that hurt inside, again). She called back, said how proud she was that I did that, wished me luck explains it to my girlfriend, and that she’d see me tomorrow. 

I spent the next two hours cleaning up furiously so the only thing she could possibly be upset about when she got home was me and my weak will. It sucks because when she came home she was so happy and ready to be home and relax and I knew I was going to take that away. 

I told her. She was upset, really upset and rightfully so. I had broken my commitment. The rest of the night was horrible, she sat crying while I sat trying to feel anything at all other than numb. She asked me wtf went through my head before doing it and I was honest: nothing. I knew it was the wrong answer but fuck me if I wasn’t going to be as honest as I could about this whole thing. It’s not that I didn’t think of her and our life, it’s just that I didn’t think of anything period. 

The next day the friend I had called came to visit and my girlfriend opted out of doing something with us that day. I understood. I talked with her about how I felt this was such an improvement for me from where I was. The fact that I reached out and talked to someone who then helped me to get rid of the dope was real progress in my head. I never would have done that in the past. Unfortunately, to my girlfriend, just the fact that I did it seemed like a step back. It was. I’m not denying that. But I felt the positives were being ignored. My friend and I had a good day together and I went home that night.

I can tell my girlfriend is hurt and I promised that this wouldn’t happen again. But how do I know? How do I know that even if I do everything I can to stay clean that the universe won’t drop another bag of dope in my lap and shut my brain off until it’s too late? I don’t. And that’s the scariest part of addiction to me is that no matter how much better you think your doing when your in that position it all goes out the window. I have no intention of looking dope, and plan to continue to stay clean but there’s always that unknown factor you can’t predict.

If you read all that thank you. Feels good to get off my chest, and hopefully it relates to some of you. I guess my point is is if you’ve been doing good and you find yourself in a position like this and your brain can come up with the slightest shred of doubt before you cross that line: listen. Listen listen listen. Fuck me do I wish I had. 

TLDR: clean for 1.5 years and turned my life around then find bag of dope in my elevator, do it, realize old habits die hard, and feel like I took a huge step back.

I love the feeling more than I love almost anything else. I usually feel nothing, on a day to day basis. I used opiates for a long time, first to manage pain, and then to feel something other than nothing. Three years ago, I left a job because the stress was too much. I was spending about 1/4 of my check every week on pills and drowning myself in debt. I decided to get out, because if my family found out they would disown me and I'd have nothing.

I got a better job and started taking care of myself. Focusing on my debts and trying to handle my stuff. I've been mostly fine, but lately almost every night I've thought about getting back to it again... ""just to chill for a few hours"". I had cut ties with anyone who did that, so I wouldn't be tempted. But, recently I found out a good friend of mine has a junkie parent and some friends who share my love of opiates. I tried to get some from the friend, but they said their friend couldn't get any.

It sounds like I'm doing just fine, but there's a problem. I suffer from chronic pain. No discernible cause. I've been able to mostly ignore it the last few years, but my job is physical and I can feel the pain start to come back so much worse than before. I'm afraid to go see a doctor, because if they want to put me on opiates I KNOW I'm going to say ""okay"" and go with it. I know I could always say no, but I don't know if I want to. People say you eventually get used to the pain, but I think that's just wishful thinking.

I'm honestly wondering if it's possible that I REALLY want to be on opiates again. That my brain is basically lying to me and saying I'm in pain just so I can be high. I've used kratom before and it didn't do much, if anything, for me.",1530726340.0

The bags look shitty like they've been laying around or just poorly put together, not to mention it looked like a couple of them had barely anything in them. Didn't get much of a high honestly. I was mainly buying them so I could be high today on my day off, but it was so weak and the small amounts meant I used most of it yesterday. The little bit I had left today I barely felt at all. I'm feeling like I got ripped off a bit, but I don't know how to address this with the dude. He's my only connect and I don't wanna fuck things up, but I also don't want him thinking I'll just accept whatever and progressively get worse quality and getting screwed on the amounts. What do you guys think? In a normal business/cust service situation the person selling would want to keep the customer happy and do something to make things right, like selling the next amount at a discount or something. Thoughts? Just accept that it happens in the game sometimes? Tell the dude it wasn't good quality?",1530721809.0

Here comes the end to an interesting adventure. Opiate highlights include:

* Going behind the counter a few times to just look for what I needed at the pharmacy because no english
* Smoking heroin daily with a religious baba in India and making a movie with him
* ODing on Keta in the lobby of the hostel in Bolivia (not opi but still)
* Getting married to a stupid Australian girl which made me want to kill myself, so dranks tea a lot  
slept in a camp in Melbourne where my camp mates introduced me to it
* Super judged by the Japanese drug store employees for buying shit tons of Bron
* So much IV morphine in cambodia
* Threesomes on opiates make you a sex god
* So many withdrawals when changing countries, basically benzo-zombie walking through customs and waking up being like how the fuck did I get in
* Traveled with a juggling midget for awhile. Feel guilty because I think I got him started on the opis. His name is Kenny.

Overall, it was a pretty good trip. The Australian girl was total shit.

Probably will leave Mongolia in a week but don't have a ticket yet. It's either that or I'm back to India.

Homosexuals were thrown in prison and ostracized by their community to the point of total destruction of the persons life, both by the State, and by their own family/friends/coworkers/community. I mean, homosexuality wasn't even discussed in polite conversation during those times. The only time gays could even truly be themselves was when they went underground, talking only to other gays in fear of being caught, or quiet straight supporters who didn't make their support known. 

Nowadays, homosexuality, as well as many other numerous sexualities are widely supported by the population. There is still those who are against it, but they are generally the small minority, or are isolated in small rural towns far away from any major population center. Gays have no fear of the government, no fear of punishment. Generally in the US, and especially places like Europe or Canada, gays can live basically completely normal lives now, no fear of anything, besides the small chance of a homophobe encounter.

The same can be said about racism and other forms of bigotry.

But not for opiate users. See, we're so discriminated against, we're not even seen as a movement worth seriously considering as oppressed. The opiate community is in a stage similar to how gays were in the 1930s, we're so discriminated against, so hated, the average person doesn't even think there's any discrimination, it's all justified. To them, it's natural to hate opiates and their users, just like in the 1930s, the idea that gays were oppressed was laughable, because *why would gays NOT be oppressed*? It was the just and moral thing then. Just like now for the punishment of opiate users. We don't even ping on the average persons radar as a group worth pity or understanding.

We're attacked by the State. If an opiate user is discovered, they receive harsh jail sentences worse than homosexuals received, worse than many murderers and rapists receive. The State absolutely ruins many lives just the same as in the past discriminations.

If discovered by the community, the opiate user receives life destroying ostracism. When discovered, friends/family have their propaganda program activated, unleashing a mix of anger, guilt, shame, and betrayal on the opiate user, making them feel like less than human for their natural desires, trying to sabotage their use, and labeling them forever as a junkie.

If discovered by the wider community, all connections are tainted, and investigation by the State is possibly started. If discovered by work, either by a community member tattling, or by a drug test, or by any other method, firing is immediate, reputation is ruined, and the opiate user is taken back to square one.

It's not our fault we we're born with our desires. Just like homosexuals sexuality being unchosen by them, our desire to use opiates wasn't our choice.

Many will say: ""opiate users *choose* to use opiates, so they're responsible"". That is how the average person thinks. Problem is that average people don't have the brains of opiate users. Average people experience happiness automatically, doing normal things makes them fulfilled and euphoric. Opiate users have the choice of depression and anxiety sober, or they can take an opiate and feel normal and happy. The same things said about us were and are said about homosexuals ""it's their choice to do homosexual acts"". Yeah, and you would to if the only way you could experience sexual release and intimate love was if it was with someone of the same gender. The comment about it being opiate users choice is much the same. It's not our fault, and anyone would do it if given the same pleasure centers as the average junkie.

Not only are all the life problems of opiates due to society, but the health problems are too: just like homosexuality was once only dangerous because of it's illegality, when HIV rates skyrocketed, opiates are too. Being gay used to reduce lifespan because of the HIV rates incurred, among other things, because homosexuals were uneducated about homosexuality, because society kept it in the dark. A similar thing could be said about opiates. Because of society, opiate users are forced to do unhealthy things. When used properly, there is very little risk of physical harm. 

We are seriously second class citizens in a bigoted world. Even those who think they're accepting and empathetic still won't share that same one sided empathy with opiate users. It's not all drug users, because cannabis is now morally alright for the most part in the US, psychedelics are becoming more accepted (and are at least not hated), and stimulant users aren't really talked about. The most hated drug user group is opiate users, I mean, opiate users are even hated by OTHER drug using groups, like the potheads or psyche community, who all talk shit about opiates and their users.

We are seriously second class citizens. We have our liberties and rights taken away from us constantly. Using any drugs, opiates included, is protected by the US constitution, and there is no actual legal document anywhere which gives the government the rights it currently thinks it has.

I mean, think about it, the ONLY place we can even discuss our opiate use is with other opiate users, either IRL or online on forums like this. We're a small, secretive, closed off community that only feels safe in our small well hidden box. Think about it! We're like a bunch of gay men in a bathhouse in 1930, hiding away, constantly paranoid of being discovered. And like in 1930, there wasn't even a real cohesive opiate freedom movement. We're not the 1970s gay community, with a burgeoning movement of pro-gay poltical power, instead we're the gays of 1930, all we do is talk about how much the current conditions suck, and the majority of opiate users aren't even trying or considering fighting for legality. Like how the average homosexual in 1930 wasn't actively fighting for freedom, instead all they wanted to do was find a way to be gay and left alone, be gay and be safe from society. I don't see opiates becoming fully legal like alcohol or cigarettes in at least another 50 years, maybe 75. It's crazy how well that timeline lines up with the early 1900s gay community, it wouldn't be another 50-80 years until homosexuality was legal and mostly accepted... We're on the exact same timeline, our community is the same as there's was, and the timeframe is the same. That's the state the current opiate community is in right now. What we need isn't people guilty of being who they are, we need a community of people PROUD of who they are, and DEMANDING their FULL INALIENABLE RIGHTS.

I say we create that community, I say every opiate user should start fighting for legalization, fighting for freedom. Don't be afraid or guilty of wanting to be allowed to use opiates, don't back down from family/friends/society, don't feel guilty for saying what you're feeling, that you want to use opiates legally and without judgement. Most of you just want to be left alone to use your opiates, because you're guilty or afraid, don't be. Be like the homosexual rights community in the 80s, loud and proud, fighting for FULL freedom, not just the freedom to hide, but the freedom to use freely.

Our generation is not likely to be the ones who gets full legality of opiates, of course it depends on a lot of things. But full legality isn't even needed, trying to get opiates completely legal is getting ahead of ourselves. The most important things we need to do now, and which would give us 80% of the relief we deserve, is getting opiate use completely decriminalized, allowing opiates to be prescribed more easily, and having morphine/diamorphine maintenance therapy   become a common, if not the most common, ""treatment"" for opiate use. All three can be done, it's already done in some European countries as well as Canada. 

The first will get rid of the harsh punishments opiate users receive.

The second will people the ability to get prescribed opiates more easily.

And the third will allow users of opiates to simply get their desired opiate from the doctor.

The first and third are the most important.

We cannot afford to be scared anymore. It is time to be brave, and demand our freedom.

Hello everyone, I have come across a rather interesting situation to say the least. I'm home right now with the fam, and tomorrow we're throwing a 4th of July party. The rents just got a new bangin' house so we are celebrating that as well. We are inviting a bunch of family friends that I personally haven't seen in a long while.

None of that is interesting, I know, I'm getting there. 

My sister, who is 5 years younger than me and is still in high school, has a dilemma. A childhood friend of hers is coming over. This girl is almost 2 years younger than my sister.

My sister, though she'll deny it, is very uppity. Straight A student, clean as a whistle, very athletic, Christian, and has a very harsh view on drugs and promiscuity. A goody-two-shoes so to speak. Which is a great thing, she'll have a great life and I'm proud of her.

But this old friend of hers has a lot of issues. Issues that you and I are more familiar with. She's 16 and she's recently started doing heroin and coke. Heavily. Waking up on park benches in the bad part of town kind of heavy. 

Her dad is a piece of shit. A classic bartard that cheats on her mom constantly. Which really sucks because I used to think he was awesome growing up. 

Anyways, this girl acts out, and quite honestly I don't blame her. She sleeps around a lot, with older men, runs away from home, and is doing awful in school. 

My sister and her other friends have started to reject her, not wanting anything to do with her because of the way she acts. Today my sister referred to her as ""trash"". That sort of hit me hard. 

No one in my family knows the full extent of my debauchery, I've told them every drug I've tried, but if they knew the sheer amount? If they knew how I lived my life away from home? No doubt my sister would consider me ""trash"".

When that hit me, the first thought that came to my mind was ""I want to pull this girl aside and talk to her, I want to help her"". I'm an addict, closing in on 6 years of on/off usage of pills, 2 months clean as of right now but I'm still struggling. I know she's acting out because she's young and because of her situation. No one else seems willing to talk to her.

I guess my question is, do you think it would be ok if I pulled her aside to talk to her at this stupid party tomorrow? Would it be weird because I'm so much older than her? I just hate to see someone that age going through similar shit I had to deal with.

I dealt with it on my own for 3 years before I found someone I could talk to. I was on the verge of suicide! I don't want to see this girl kill herself or continue on this path feeling like she doesn't have anyone to talk to.

So would it be too weird to try and give her advice? If you think I should try, how should I go about it? ""Hey I heard you do heroin, we should talk"" sounds fucking creepy in my head. Any advice?

Sorry for the wall of text, I thought some context was necessary.",1530689576.0

The time has come for me to put a new level of effort into staying clean and sober. I’ve been fucking around with this lifestyle for the last couple years, starting with something as innocuous as taking a couple of hydrocodone pills to smoking roughly a gram of black tar each day.

I’ve started to feel the effects in my lungs, I can’t handle the constant anxiety of scoring nor can I keep up financially, and I’m just plain tired of not even being able to get out of bed in the morning without putting something into my body. It’s been real, with some great times in between, but it’s time I walk away and get my shit together. I have too much going on at the moment to be going through withdrawals unexpectedly, needing money to stay right, and all of the other drama that surround this lifestyle.

I love all of y’all, I won’t be gone forever but this sub can be triggering and so I will be prioritizing self care - meaning you won’t be seeing me nearly as often. This time I really want to make this work and that means giving up more than just heroin, I’ve got to give up triggering temptations such as coming on here to salivate over dope porn or going to see my homeless friend while I weigh the pros and cons of grabbing “one last 20.” Hell, I even downloaded a sobriety calendar on my phone for the first time ever.

Tomorrow is the first day of the rest of my life, and I hope I can seize the day in a new way. Happy nods, my r/opiates family, please stay safe as you navigate the next challenge you face. You are unique, awesome, and so worthy of every good thing imaginable - no matter what anybody says.

Enough sappy stuff, sweet dreams y’all!

Well, on [this season five episode of Babylon 5 - episode 8](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0517643/), titled **Day of The Dead** they tackle addiction ever so briefly for the second time in the series.


The first time they dealt with addiction was when one of the main characters, a doctor, was addicted to stims. It took multiple episodes for that arc to come to a head but they covered all of the major stages. Another main character is a recovering alcoholic, and he has two relapses during the show.

&nbsp;

**Before you proceed further:**
#Spoiler alert
...

&nbsp;

In 'Day of the Dead', one of the alien species on the station is celebrating a holiday that comes once every 200 years. It's practically a rip off of the Mexican 'Dios des Morte'/'Day of the Dead' but when dealing with aliens, and perhaps some of their futuristic technology shit gets interesting.


Basically, different characters are going about their night time routines, some sleeping and being woken up when old dead friends, family members and lovers appear in their rooms - seemingly alive.

&nbsp;

The commander of the space station sees a friend in her room, someone who almost didn't recognize her because they died twenty years earlier. Turned out they died from an overdose. They wouldn't answer whether they did it on purpose when asked but maybe they'll flesh that out before the episode is over.


Even better, the dead best friend asks the commander if she had any stuff, ""we could have a little party."" The captain declined, then her BFF is like, ""didn't we have so much fun?""

The captain responds, ""no, we were cold, sick.. we were hungry all the time.  

&nbsp;

Fast forward to the end of the episode, the ""ghosts"" or ""electromagnetic anomalies"" begin to leave as the sun rises. 

The captains BFF finally admits that she did do it on purpose. ""I just couldn't go on, don't hate me.""

The captain gets to say right before her friend leaves for the last time, ""I could never hate you.""",1530679939.0

As an American, the opiate crisis is always in the news, how people were given opiates by doctors and then became addicted to them. So, my question is, \*\*did the people who became addicted to prescription opiates become addicted by not following the doctor's instruction written on the bottle on purpose (experimenting), or are they so addictive that even taking them as prescribed can get you addicted?\*\*

 I hope that makes sense; it's a bit of a tough question to pose. Like, if I were to, for some reason, be prescribed opiates, if I were to take them as told, is it possible for me to become addicted? That's another way of posing it, I guess. Thank you for your time; I've always been curious about this.",1530672279.0

Listen, I'm a musician writer and lyricist. I can make my own beats already and have for years. However, I'm looking for top quality beats using original samples on top of original grooving tracks.

No kick hi hat snare basic beats please. Samples from various genres and melodies needed. I make mine for fun, but they are on outdated programs with outdated samples. Hip hop beats with soul, funk, jazzy samples I'm into in particular

I've got regular guitar songs, but many works are designed too fast for that type of music.  If you need proof of writing quality, that'll be sent.  I want producers who could perform live and make this collaboration a show. We'd use a live band for certain tracks. I'm Currently Guitar and bass guitar proficient.  

I seek all the creative outlets I can.

All his family knows he does it and he has nothing going for him at the moment. No job, no school, no nothing just 30s is all his lifes about.

I got great replies about the simple question of which one is the most euphoric. [Thread here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8vds3k/euphoric_benzo/)

After considering all the facts, especially availability on the market, [posology](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/posology) and ROA, I chose **midazolam**.

A big pro of midazolam is the fact that is snortable and possible to IV, and being a junkie with a needle fixations, that's a  plus. The big con is the price, my plug was for a blank script for USD$20, and the midazolam itself was USD$30 for 30 pills of 15 mg. Not cheap for Chile standards, and as a comparison, generic diazepam is USD$1 for 30 pills of 10 mg. But I went with it.

I proceed with my plan and score the beautiful pic you see. I crush and make two lines.

They have a blue kind of envelope, which I tried to separate from the rest of the valuable powder, because I'm sure that's not midazolam and it is some formulation release topic.

I snort. Oh shit it burns! Nobody told me that. Snort is the last on my list of ROAs, but I wanted to try this before BANG THAT SHIT, to experience a milder first encounter. After 1-3 minutes I start to feel a deep calm, it definitely works, and was very good with  the morphine I shot like an hour before this^(\*).

So, here I am, nodding like a mf in the library, having a good time.

Thanks for all the advice that made this an ""as safe as possible"" experience. A midazolam shot is coming when I'm safe at home.

Stay safe.

Haven't been on my worst bender but have been doing dope in Thailand for about 3 months straight up to a half gram a day. I snort never shoot. I have access to dope but it's time to save money and reset the receptors.  Anyways this time I have access to many weapons to fight the evil ninja that is known as withdrawal. 

First I will be using loperamide also known as Immodium to start the battle.  He is bringing his friends omeprazole and cimintedine to give him strength and I'm thinking to use him for the first 4 days. 

Next to the battle is gabapentin.  Thailand is actually pretty unique in the sense that you don't need a script for gabapentin or lyrica so u can get as much as that as I need.  If anyone has any advice as to how much to use of either other both substance then I think we might be able to put a whooping on withdrawals ass. Also plan to use for 4 days.

Finally I want to finish withdrawal off with the weapon of the angels : Tramadol.  I'm not a huge fan but it's also otc in Thailand and it helps with the paws although I know it can be addictive as well. 

Anyways.  Please if anyone has any advice or dosage recommendations I would really appreciate it. I have to work full time and I can't be a dope sick idiot.  I've had a lot of success with gabapentin in the past but I don't remember how much and I don't think I liked the side effects.  Lyrica might be worth a shot.

I middle for a few people to buy pills (don't worry, I'm not one of those asshole middles, I don't even ask to get paid for the deal, I only take extra money when its offered) and whether its the plug being late, out, or any little hiccup in the deal I almost always get constantly bitched at until the deal is done. Except for this one dude, we'll call J. 

J is the coolest dude I know. When he wants something, he gives me the cash, tells me what he wants, and no matter what happens he's cool with it. One time my plug was about to reup so I got the cash and went to the plugs house. I got there before the delivery so I was there as it got dropped off and they were presses. I didn't pay anything yet so I still had his cash, and when I called to let J know what was up he said no biggie, hold onto my cash and get them whenever you can. I never take advantage of him being so chill, I just really appreciate knowing someone who understands the struggles. 

Just today he placed a big order and since my main was out I had to go through a backup. I checked them and they looked good, but when I got home the imprint was all fucked on all but one pill. I tell J I got fucked over but I'll make it right on payday. He says no problem, he just wants the legit one. I'm normally able to drive to him but tonight I couldn't, and I know J has a suspended license so he shouldn't be driving so I tell him if i can find a ride ill be there. He says he'll risk it and drive to me. 

When he got here I apologized like hell, told him to just give me a few days and ill set things straight. Again, he's totally calm and cool about it, and then he hands me some cash for the trouble. No matter how many ways I tried to tell him not to pay me for losing his money he won't let me turn it down.

*The Last Temptation of The Middleman* (Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Cock) by /u/DRUGS_ARE_USEFUL - AKA your lord and savior forever. 

It was one of those days where you wake up to realize your life is fucked and you have nothing going for yourself. Of course the day began with me thinking about drugs, who could get me drugs, or where I could go to get drugs.  I took to my demonic altar and realized there was something new there. It was a rock that I had never seen before. I didn’t think much of it since I had a habit of picking up shit from random places, whether it was mine or not, and bringing them home. I figured that must have been the case. 

I hadn’t done any drugs for at least a week but the ever-present cravings were still there. Not physical, but mental, as the most intense cravings always were for me. I took the rock and retreated back to my computer, where I almost always check my drug related reddit account for new PMs in the hope that someone in my area might need drugs. Since the ~~[REDACTED]~~ sub is gone (damn yankees), this has become a much rarer occurrence than it had been not 6 months prior. I don’t know why, but I gripped the stone in my hand and hoped to my demonic pagan lords that there would be something here that would help me get through the day. I felt a shock in my hand which made me jump. As I looked back up to expect the usual liquid crystal misery that awaited me, there was a big orange envelope waiting for me. I figured it was just going to be some everyday responses to my previous shitposts on /r/opiates, but alas, it was not. My inbox was full of requests for me to be a middleman again. 

For some strange reason, all of these users were coming through my hometown on the same day. “Holy shit!” I exclaimed, with a mixed sense of jubilation and anxiety, “I hope my dudes are on today!”. Of course, they always are. Why would someone like my dope boy take a day off without letting everyone know in advance. There’s just so many people out there who depend on him for their daily fix. I called ahead to make sure and was not surprised that he was very happy to serve me and anyone else I had to bring him. 

I figured shit, this kind of thing happens only once in a lifetime. I got PMs from /u/DeepFriedFear, /u/FashionablyFake, /u/spinderella69, /u/fat_loser_junkie, /u/inlovewithheroin, /u/bagzplz, /u/chasingd0pamine, and even /u/jmkogut, which was weird because I thought he deleted his account. That was only the tip of the iceberg, my inbox was full of messages from users I’d never talked to before. I responded only to the ones I recognized at first, but the temptation of even more free drugs given to me for helping people out overwhelmed me and I decided to send out a mass PM. Here’s what it said:

“F(R)IENDS! Rejoice at the knowledge that you will have all the drugs you need. My plug is always on point and his shit is legit. I don’t know if any of you are aware, but you are in my fair city of ~~[REDACTED]~~ at the same time as many other /r/opiates users. Because of this, I have decided to arrange the biggest IRL meet up this sub will ever see. I have access to a chill spot where we can all get together and share your drugs with me. My old friend Lilith happens to own an old hotel with a large ballroom. I have instructed him to kick all the guests out and restrict the entire building to me and my people. Respond to this PM with an RSVP and I will forward you all of the details.“

I figured this would never work, getting all of these junkies, pill fiends, bartards, and over-all drug addicts to get to one place at a pre determined time. Then I realized who exactly I was dealing with. I told them I could get them drugs, so they’ll most definitely be there. Awesome. I got a ton of messages within minutes and told them where the spot was. 

So I had Lilith turn the ballroom into a makeshift opium den. He took a bunch of mattresses out of the rooms and draped poppy pod printed sheets on the walls (She already had these because she was a kind of psychonaut opioid addict as well, and you know how those hippie psychonauts like their big tapestry things). She asked me just how the hell I met all of these people, and I just responded with “We’re part of a secret society of dope fiends that meet up every year or so to get high as fuck” (obviously not the case, but I didn’t want to worry her with the fact that I had no idea what the fuck all of these people were doing in my city on the same day). I made a sick playlist with music that I like and figured the other users would like, because who the fuck doesn’t like music?

So the stage was set, so to say, and the first person showed up at 6PM and I welcomed them to my den on iniquity. It just so happened to be /u/FashionablyFake, who I had met up with previously. I was happy for this because she was a big deal in the /r/opiates world which would reduce my anxiety about greeting all of these other people I barely, if at all, know. The next one to show up was /u/ODB2 who actually has crazy hair just like Coolio, I was not expecting that especially on a 5’4” asian girl. Then, shockingly, I opened the door to /u/jmkogut. I knew instantly it was him because he only had one arm. I said to him “Holy shit dude, I thought you got your arm fixed up after you fucked it up so bad. What happened?”. “Well, I guess I didn’t learn my lesson, I was dopesick and out of my boy, but I had a bottle of oral dilaudid solution this time and figured it might work better. It had shit bioavailability orally so I tried again, this time I wasn’t so lucky” he replied. “Damn dude, shit luck I guess? Or maybe you’re just insane, I dunno. Whatever either way, welcome to the party of the decade!”. He proceeded to chat it up with /u/FashionablyFake who he had never met before, but knew well online. Eventually it was nearly one hundred /r/opiates users that showed up. 

For another hour or so, the rest of my new best fiends showed up. I took people’s orders and cash as they entered, ensuring them I was good for it. More than a few exclaimed “I NEVER LET MY MONEY WALK!”, angrily, but thankfully the other OG /r/opiates people reassured them that it would be all good. I had my dope boy ready for a big order, I told him I’d want as much dope and hard as he could get us, because this was going to be a *hell* of a night. He showed up and I met him around back. I made sure the bags were all right and proceeded to put tags with the buyer’s usernames on them. /u/chasingd0pamine got a gram of boy, /r/FashionablyFake got a half of boy and a half of hard, etc, etc. /u/Traceyh415 even showed up for a minute to pass out clean rigs and plenty of narcan to go around. Thank you so much for that Tracey, but not even your good heart could bring light to this dark chasm of reality (also, I have no idea how she found out about this, but I don’t really care anymore). 

I went in and announced that they may all stop going crazy with their RLS, their drugs have arrived. I handed everyones packages out and they proceeded to lay around on the beds and use them through their various preferred methods of administration. There was a bit more boofing going on than I expected, but I was all about it. I figured this might end up being a boring ass time because everyone’s just going to pass out after they do their dope. However, I was happy to see that everyone who got their crack cocaine was ready and willing to share it with everyone else. There were speedballs galore and so many bulbs going around that it was like being at a Devin the Dude concert, but instead of blunts it was rocks. 

After we all fixed up, the happiness seemed to permeate all of our previously disgustingly sad and lonely lives. We began to rejoice in each others embrace, an embrace which quickly turned into an all out fuck fest. Everyone was tearing each others clothes off and all the sweaty bodies seemed to merge into one large mass of sexual energy. Cocks in pussies, asses, mouths, ears, noses, and pretty much any open orifice you could imagine. I was completely filled up, just as everyone else was, simultaneously. My spirit seemed to raise up into the air above everyone, and I could see this disgustingly beautiful orgy from above. It was a moment of pure ecstasy, but without any MDMA, which was weird for me. However, a moment was all it was. 

All of my new friends became something else they ran out of holes to fuck so they starting ripping open new ones. The easiest to get to were the existing track marks on peoples arms and feet. It seemed as if they could all smell the blood from the recently exposed veins. The beautiful sight turned into a horrible nightmare as blood and guts began to engulf everyone involved. It was the most puzzling sight, as they all seemed to be enjoying themselves even more now that they were ripping each other apart. I then realized, it was not my ‘spirit’ floating above, but my corporal body. I looked in my hand and I was once again gripping that stone I had found on my altar earlier that day. 

In a brilliant flash of light, I was now at the door outside of the ballroom. Standing there was my dope boy, but I quickly realized he wasn’t a boy at all. He looked at me and his eyes seemed to glow red and his face transformed into a flaming skull and other images I could have never have dreamt of even in my most horrible nightmares, but I was intrigued. Obviously, I said “holy shit, are you Ghost Rider??!!” but as the words came out of my mouth, he said the same thing at the same time, like he knew what I was thinking. We both said “seriously dude, what the fuck are you?” simultaneously. He put his hand out and I instantly knew to shut the fuck up. He walked towards me and put his hand around my fist, still gripping that weird stone. He raised my hand up with his and looked into my eyes, which felt like he was looking deep into my soul. He said “I am Abbadon, harbinger of Lord Baal, the ruler of the underworld, and I left this stone for you. It will give you the power to bring upon the end of all for us and all of my demonic brethren. Just think of something you know other humans would want, and it will happen. However, you have already witnessed what will come of that need for bliss. They will have so much of what they want that it will lead to a bloody end, no matter what”. 

I was floored. I never imagined any of the evil gods I was pledging my loyalty to would actually show their faces to me. However I knew that I couldn’t renege on my pledge of loyalty to these beasts, I had to continue what I began. He also told me that I would be rewarded with a seat on the Council of Evil Demonic Entities once my work was complete. Apparently harvesting the life force of everyone I brought to the party to add to their powers of seduction. 

I bowed down on my knees, as he was still gripping my fist. I kissed his hand and looked up into his horrible yet beautiful glowing eyes and said “Let’s get to work, master”.

Mine was probably from years ago when I used to mess with this half Puerto Rican, half Alabaman dude I met while living in the middle of nowhere Mexico. He was pretty cool and he used to hook me up with weed for free. Not a bad deal.

He sold all sorts of stuff, but I was really into the green back then, and he liked me for whatever reason. I never asked him about the other stuff  and I think he enjoyed having a somewhat normal friendship with someone - we watched football together and that was about it. Plus he carried a pistol and actively shot at people when he was at work, so I figured it was safer to pretend to be ignorant of his day job

Anyway, I ran into him in the middle of town one night and he invited me over to listen to his new speaker system (fair play, it sounded pretty sweet), and it wasn’t until I got there that I realized how much meth he was smoking. 

Long story short, I’m in this house with an 8 foot wall around it, CCTV watching the front gate, with the Chronic 2000 blaring at ungodly volumes and his Desert Eagle pointed at my face, insisting that I hit his glass pipe.

I’ll give it to him - he could be quite convincing when he needed to be. The night only got weirder from there

Anyway, that was kinda freaky.

While I haven't smoked weed for about 2 weeks and the test will be about a 3 week period, I'm also nervous about opiates coming up.

I thought those drinks were fairly bullshit but Vice did a great write up/test on a few with a habitual daily user of marijuana and that shit actually worked.

Now I would assume that these would work for just about anything as what they basically do is dilute your urine so much shit is undectable while replacing all the various minerals and whatnot they test for that can typically mark a test as too diluted. And one of the drinks Vice tested the woman actually smoked WHILE she drank the drink and still passed.

I was curious if anyone has used and tried this stuff particularly for opiates. I tried googling it but most were people being skeptical but a lot also seemed to involve user error (for example, a lot you're supposed to drink the drink then fill it up twice with water and drink all the water and then also piss about 3 times before you test and you have about a 5 hour window from when you first take a drink).

So has anyone tried it? Any particular brands you suggest?

 You always make me feel so uncomfortable and awkward, so I finally said to myself why do I put up with this? I didn’t have to fly my family out here to see yours? You never once came and seen us, why do we always have to put ourselves in this so obvious shit situation? 
 We have the same father and he wants all of us together for some holidays, which I can understand but I am too grown to be doing this. I thought last time was horrible enough that I was never gonna come back and have to endure this type of humiliation.
  but two years later and back again. 

 Just because she lives in a pretty awesome town doesn’t mean I have to come here for her so fuck you (half sister) and I’m going to have a vacation the right way, without all your negativity and  judgment. I would be a heroin addict any-day over your alcoholic life.

The most recent bout of shit happened about a year back. I was muscling tar (dumb, I know) and I got a horrible abcess that I let go for too long and it landed me in the hospital for a little over 2 weeks. I got home and less than a couple weeks later I was evicted.

So, now I've been living in a tent and doing heroin on a daily basis. I'm 30 and I'm just starting to think, if I don't figure something out soon, I fear it will be too late. Like I've already said, I've tried a lot of methods to get clean and it hasn't stuck.

What I was thinking about today was, going to detox, which I know will get me through the worst of it and then immediately moving to another state. Maybe somewhere in the Midwest where the cost of living is low and there are labor jobs to be found.

8vll05,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8vll05/free_half_gram_yesterday/,11,https://redd.it/8vll05,NotPoliticalyCorrect,Free half gram yesterday,"So I phoned up my guy that delivers yesterday 9:30am and asked him to drop off a half gram and he said he'd be about an hour. I had to go down to the shops to lift money out the ATM (£20) just as I was about to leave the house my guy pulled up. It had only been 15 minutes since I phoned him so I went out and told him I needed to go to the shop and could he drop me off. He said it wouldn't be a problem and we went to the shop but something was wrong with their machine (postoffice) and I'd need to wait 15/20 minutes to get money so I went back out and told my guy. He gave me the half gram and said he'd pop by in a couple of hours and off he went. 
   A couple of hours go by and I hear him peeping out side and I go out to give him his money and after I do he gives me another half gram?? I say to him what's this for and he replies back if I don't want it then to give him it back. So I take it rather confused. No idea why he gave me it but it was nice of him to do so! He must have been in a generous mood or something ?? Or maybe won a load of cash or something who knows but I got as high as a kite yesterday! He didn't mention it this morning when he came as he was in a rush he just dropped off my half G and off he went. 
Edit: forgot to say this was only the second time using him in a couple of months as he kinda fucked me about when I wanted to score in town and he asked me to meet him somewhere but he never showed up and when I phoned him about an hour later he said he had run out and he defenetly went to where I was supposed to meet him.",1530560391.0

With a habit that goes up and down between .5g to a gram a day, dependant on how much money I can scrounge up per day. Skip to present day, I've lost my job because of too many missed days because of withdrawal sickness, combined with a shitty attitude while at work. (I was a mechanic, so trust me when I say the shitty attitude would have been there regardless of opiate addiction). Anyways I just felt a little background was warranted, but before I get too far off track. So I did a ton of research on Kratom, and it's supposed life changing results for all types of opiate addicts. Que to buying an entire kilo of some pure red indo that's supposed to be really good for wds. 

Let me first say, the ungodly bad taste is just slightly better than suboxone in my opinion. And to top that off, with my addiction and tolerance, the amount of kratom that I'm supposed to take to curb the shakes n sweats would be enough to make anyone sick to their stomach... maybe I'm crazy, or doing it wrong. But I've had to basically tissue bomb about a half gram at a time, to be able to swallow it, and repeat that till I've got 5-6 grams down the hatch.

Maybe it's all in my head, but I feel like all it does is upset my stomach, and make wds slightly more tollerable. But with the nausea it is hardly worth trying to swallow that much. Any advice or thoughts, or stories would be much appreciated guys.",1530558969.0

Cliff's sister, we'll call her Tara has a friend named Danika. Tara's friend used to be her BFF, and they're still somewhat tight. Nonetheless, as Tara has gotten into doing crack, this has played a role in straining their relationship. I remember the time Tara and possibly Danika stole from their crack dealer and there was loud drama outside the house at 3am. 

&nbsp;

#Background:

Tara used to be my number one connect for subs because Cliff never could get them even when he said he could. I tried every which way. I used to make sure arrangements were made on pay day/D-day (Dope purchasing day) and assurances were often made but unfulfilled. For a time I thought that paying for the subs ahead of time would help because Cliff could then buy the subs when the sub connect showed up. For a time our dope middle would stop by his ex's house to get subs. On a few occasions he'd call or return the money because he couldn't get subs. ""I can't get subs, want the money back or want a half a bundle?""



Other times, quite often Cliff would promise to buy subs in two days when he got paid if I bought dope that day. My logic was okay, he'll pay me back in subs and dope. In practice he'd pay me back with dope or pills unless he had some bullshit reason for not getting them.

In which case, regardless, Cliff would not get subs. At best I'd get pills, eventually - within a week.

&nbsp;

Then around late November I completely gave up on buying subs through Cliff. I also made a point of buying them for myself and not informing him that I had any. Although he had trouble procuring subs, he had no trouble asking for some if he had no other option. At one point his sister may or may not have come to his part of the house to talk trash. Among the things she allegedly said, she told her brother that she gets me subs which I don't share with him. 

&nbsp;

Cliff claims he suspects she did it to draw a wedge between us. Haha, no outside help necessary for that! Anyway, I keep saying ""alleged"" details because for all I know, Cliff made the occurence up to get me to show my cards. He's a fairly decent poker player and bluffs like it's second nature. After that alleged incident where his sister supposedly informed him that I was buying subs from her without his knowledge, Cliff texted in an upset tone. ""After all the shit I've done for you..""

I simply denied it and didn't bother bringing up points to counter his premise. If I say he screwed me over that time he lied to me about getting 30 subs for $200, he'd argue that he did indeed pay me back. He did, but not in hard cash. Whether we believe that 20 15mg oxys are the same as $200 - it isn't helpful if you had to wait a week.

&nbsp;

If I did not make other arrangements that week, if I was not able to make other arrangments that week, I would have been so fucked for Black Friday and Thanksgiving. I've bought this up before and will probably mention it again. It was a small triumph to know I had what I needed in order to be well and able to work my ass off for 12-hours on the busiest days in retail sales.


&nbsp;


#Our Feature Presentation


Last week was Cliff's script day. I hadn't spoken to him or hung out with him in many days but the night before he asked me if I could pick up his script. He promised his usual compensation as well as his a belated present. As far as he was concerned I was taking a break from subs anyway and was already planning to buy Dope from Derrick or Tim. So, a few more pills to go with all of that seemed logical. I counted it as one less day in which I would have to take subs and frankly I was already on a lower dose of subs by that point.


&nbsp;

Thus I wake up dutifully ready to make the bike ride to the pharmacy. Figuring that by 12pm Cliff would call me and say ""it's ready, come to my house and pick up my ID"", I instead got a call from Cliff saying ""open your door, I'll be there very soon. I got the script already, my ride helpe me buy soda.. I'll still give you the pills I promised."" I thought it was fair to get pills because heck, I was up and ready to mobilize and appreciate that Cliff saw it that way too.

&nbsp;


Upon arriving at my house, Cliff explains the reason him and his driver needed to come here. There were police at his house, you see. Tara and Danika got into a big fight. There was some physical action in the fight, at one point Tara filmed Danika ""hitting her"", although Danika was actually keeping her distance.


The crux of the incident?

The reason they fought?

Can you guess?

Why am I asking redundant questions without answering them?


Naturally, Danika was pissed because Tara stole something from her. Perahaps she fell asleep and Tara saw fit to run through her bags or pockets? 

&nbsp;

Before we continue, it should be noted that Tara, Cliff's sister, also likes to do angel dust. One time she described herself as being on a sort of high-horse because she doesn't do dope like her brother. In reality, she hasn't stopped at dust and is definitely doing crack and could always use another hit.



On a side topic, I always wonder why it's called dust. Since it is liquid that you dip your cigarette into, you'd think they could call it ""fun dip"", ""angel dip"", ""angel juice"" or sometihng more accurate. Does it start off as dust that get's turned into a liquid solution? Well whatever. Just sayin'.


&nbsp;

It is because Tara does crack that I had to stop buying subs from her. I didn't mind if she was only paying $5 for the subs but I always had to pay her first and wait. Most of the time she'd have them within a half hour, other times she'd have them the next morning.


There was one incident where ran with most of my money and blamed her sub connect and promised to pay me back. Kept making up delays when I asked, and only when I offered more money for subs was she able to get them. So I did so one last time since it was an emergency and wrote off the rest. ""I'm not a scumbag like my brother"", but even her scummy brother finds time to throw me pills of measurable value from his script when he owes me.


&nbsp;

~~So yeah, that's basically it.~~ Cliff's sister Tara and her BFF Danika got into a big fight. Danika had to leave, and in the process she called the cops.

**Now here's where it gets a bit more interesting...**

When Danika called the cops, she reported that Clifford who lives in the downstairs dwelling with his mom is in fact ""abusing an elderly person."" Not sexually, just in the sense that he's a scumbag who fucked her over by making it impossible for her to pay the electrical bill thereby putting them in a position to not have electricity on the hottest summer days while the dwelling stews in the overpowering stench of raw garbage. I believe this may fall under the purvue of adult protective services. 


&nbsp;

**Cliff's triumph:**

No, not only did he get his pills that day but they whitewashed the situation in time for the cops to arrive. Not completely, for example they didn't clean the downstairs dwelling and there's still no electricity down there. They had Cliff's mom go upstairs, an amazing feat of it's own considering how arthritic her knees are and set her up to sit comfortably in a clean room.


As Cliff triumphantly described to me, ""by the time the cops showed up, my mom was sitting comfortably in the lounge chair, with air conditioning and an iPad."" I guess the iPad is like the cherry on the top, shows how mom is living in the lap of luxury in contrast to Danika's call to the cops when ratting the kids out.

&nbsp;

Sidenote, that iPad is a first gen model. I'll take anything from the garbage if it's electronic and not covered in foodstuff or shit. Not a grand device but sufficient to browse the web and use YouTube, which is why I origianlly gave it to her. I don't know how his mom could to go back downstairs to what she refers to as her ""hole"". A highly bedbug infested bed, if you look at the corner of her mattress you can see a fuck ton of black dots that represent bed bug defication. Same with Cliff's bed but she's a lot more vulnerable.


At least Cliff was able to drag his brother's old (but cleaner) mattress from outside, despite it sitting there for two days. Despite his brother throwing it out because of bed bugs - just not as severe I suppose. Cliff's mom is not likely to have that luxury -- if it could be called that.

&nbsp;


Later that day I stopped by his hovel to help him turn on his computer and he asked to borrow $20. Of course I was very reluctant, the term ""what could go wrong"" comes to mind. He then pointed out, ""I came to your house and gave you pills even though I didn't have to."" True that he did not have to give me anything aside from the promised belated birthday present, but he didn't come to my house to kindly deliver pills. He did so because his ride couldn't stop at his own house due to the afformentioned circumstances in which cops were present.


&nbsp;


Finally, a few days later I went to meet up with Danika the sub connect. Such a relif that she was able to meet me not far from my area on a very hot day. I had already enacted strict rationing protocools but would be completely dry within a day or two. She recanted her side of the story.



She also expressed triumph in (erroneously) knowing that Cliff's mom was taken away from that hovel. I almost slipped and told her how it didn't turn out as she thought but there was no reason to do that. Is Cliff's mom better off in her own home or in a nursing home? I'm not really sure, I've seen publicly funded nursing homes indirectly kill people and I've seen their staff make effort to provide a decent quality of assisted living. 

&nbsp;

I'm not sure what to think about the status quo except that Cliff's mom is still sane despite her son and daughter. She deserves to make the decision on where she lives. I hope if and when it becomes truly dangerous she'll seek a better option but until the next major health scare, very little else can make her move out.",1530551942.0

He went on for a good 15 minutes while she was too shocked to even finish her shot. The air was fucking still, like she just got murdered and we were trying not to look at her corpse. 

Later on he told us that in some places, the wind was so strong he would pedal and just literally not even fucking move. Oh, and that when he was done copping, the wind had changed directions so he fought that back up the hill lmao

What happens next? SCARED AF","Hell everyone, first off I want to say I’ve been a lurker of this community for awhile and y’all are like a family to me but I’ve just now have gotten the courage to create an account.

So on to what happened yesterday. I got pulled over and the cop smelled marijuana and conducted a search on my vehicle. I was very respectful and nice and everything was fine. I actually broke down in front of the cop and told him where the tiny bit of powder literally a .02 of H was, he got it out and I explained to him that I am in college and I’ve never had any kind of charge of any sort. The cop seemed to be really forgiving but he kept asking me what the powder was, and I kept denying it was mine and said I think it’s some sort of opiates, maybe crushed oxy or soemthing. He ended up giving me a possession of OxyContin (misd.) citation and let me go on my way and gave me this whole speech about not ever doing this again and to get my act together because I have a bright future. BUT he also said he was going to send the powder to the state testing lab and when he gets the results back the charge could change and he would then issue a warrant for my arrest for the new charge!? I am scared to death right now... can he really do that?? Will my charge automatically increase to a felony when they get the results? I HAVE TO GET A LAWYER. I plan on talking to a lawyer ASAP. What should I do??",1530540461.0

I underestimated the strength of the dope with my first shot being 80mg. I had dosed suboxone only 12 hours earlier so I figured I'd go a little higher than my usual tester shot. It almost laid my ass out. 

From there I was using a 50mg shot out of bed, 50mg line at lunch, 100mg shot when I got home and sometimes another 50mg shot before bed. This lasted about a week until the gear was gone. I knew there were going to be some wd's, but I figured suboxone would get me through it. The night before my first day without, I only had 30mg left. My junkie ass said fuck it and shot my last 30mg. Stupid mistake. 

I woke up the next morning in a pool of sweat and could barely get out of bed. I layed around for awhile struggling to get the motivation to get some OJ for a kratom transition back to suboxone. Finally, I said fuck it and decided to wash and shoot some cottons I had saved to plug or eat. The shot seemed okay and was actually pretty dark, but the thought of it was enough to make me gag. I did it anyway and got lucky this time, since I didn't get cotton fever or an infection. This brought withdraw from 7/10 to a 5. I got my ass in the car and got some OJ, mixed a fat doses of kratom and choked it down. 
This didn't do much for withdraws, maybe a 5 to a 4. 

After a couple hours I was back in the 7-8 range and decided I should be fine to do some suboxone. Perhaps I would have been fine if I ate it, but I decided to load it into a rig. I shoot it quite often and had some micron filtered. I wanted instant relief so loaded up 2mg and did the shot. What followed next was one of the worst experience of my life. Instant heat flash with a gallon of sweat pouring down my face. My lungs started contracting, kinda like when you get in a cold shower, and I felt like I could barely breath. A terrible sensation overwhelmed my body and I felt quite confused and dazed. A plethora of emotions came flying in all at once of guilt, shame, depression and anxiety. I made my way to the bathroom and vomited. Then I crawled in the shower, turned it super hot, and layed there for 20 mins. Finally I made it to my bed and kind of dozed off in agony for about 30 mins.

Then, the weirdest fucking thing happened when I awoke. I felt pretty alright. It was almost as if I had combined 3 days of wd into an hour and now I was on the home stretch. I still had heat flashes, sweats, and runny nose, but I slept fine that night and returned to woke the next day (Monday). 

Overall, this was a terrible experience and was flat out irresponsible and stupid. I have a new found respect for anyone that's been brought back with naloxone as I imagine it was this x10. Anyways, not sure how much anyone can learn from this experience, since it was so stupid, but  I strongly suggest you always error on the side of caution when it comes to your first dose of sub, as the alternative is much worse. Also don't fucking shoot it so it kicks in faster, thus increasing the bio of naloxone. Oh, and also save a morning/weaning dose...",1530494064.0

I demanded a younger patron explain to me how he lost his eye even though it humiliated him.  My dad told me to drop it, and I raised my voice.  At night, I walked streets of black stone hoping to find trouble.  And I did when someone outside of a bar asked me,

“Hey, Gringo, do you want to knife fight?”

“Yes.  With you?  Where are the knives?”

I was calling his bluff as much as anything.  He yelled to one of his buddies by the bar to go get so and so and bring the knives.  I stared down at my feet in wet gravel and scattered trash.  All I could think about were my own blood-soaked socks and the despair of my father walking up to the scene if my throat were slashed.  It was everything I ever wanted.

There was like folders of worksheets and student work so I think it was a teachers, while looking through I saw a few blister packs of some pills. I assumed they were like Claritin or something..... Turned out it was orally disintegrating clonazepam .5mg. Three of em ! 

My moral side said just leave it, but my junkie side told me to just grab em - fuck it, you know? They obviously had em prescribed so they have more I'm sure. And I love klonipin- if it was anything else I would have left it but I couldn't resist. 

Not the most morally upstanding thing to do but shit man I saw an opportunity and took it. There was money in there too - probably like 150 or so, I could have grabbed that too and gotten myself a brick and then some but I left the cash because I don't take people's money that's not right...

The kpins tho? Fuck it. If there was a ton of them I wouldn't have taken em all but this was just three. I left the money but grabbed the kpins.

well. my friends thank me. i should be thanking me. but i'm not. i'm not happy.

i had a dream last night. long, intense, and vivid. i woke up feeling even more tired than when i went to sleep. i felt tired, broken, and in pain. i felt like... like i was in withdrawals.

many things happened in the dream, but there was one thing that stuck with me, and my fucking god did it hurt both my pride, my sense of self control, and my heart; in my dream i was offered heroin, or rather asked for it and got given it, and in my dream i was aware i'd quit and had people wanting me to not relapse, and still, i took it, greedily, immediately, jumping for it, and reaching for a spoon, to cook up a shot, because it didnt matter to me anymore at that moment, in that dream, i just. wanted. a fucking. hit.

i hate it. i hate my primal, subconscious reaction, that H-e is above all else, that H-e is all i want and all i live for, H-e is my life, and i need nothing more but H-im.

My question is: I have a script, empty script, which I can fill with the second most regulated drugs in my country. I want to try a really euphoric benzo and did my research, no etiazolam, no RC benzos. I'll write a list of what is available:

* Alprazolam 1mg (max dose here!)
* Bromazepam, brotizolam,clobazam. Should be available, but are rare to find in many drug stores.
* Clonazepam, the good ol' one. but I have a plug for it, so next...
* Chlorazepate, chlordiazepoxide.
* Clotiazepam, already tried it, didn't like it much
* The classical diazepam (Valium). I've read some post about people considering it a great score, but is so highly prescribed and common in this country, idk, tell me what you think.
* Ketazolam (hard to find).
* Lorazepam (good anxiolitic, no euphoria)
* Lormetazepam (first time I hear of it)
* **Midazolam**, I've read many post saying is highly euphoric and can be snorted, is also not that difficult to find, looks like my most probable buy, but discussion is open.
* Triazolam (Idon't know it)  


That's the list, as a side note, I will tell you that Dextromethorphane (Robotusin) is on the same list. LOL.

wearing rose colored glasses we reminisce

a punch thrown with a twist

stamped black and blue, heroin deviously kissed

i untwist, resist, and out the door i dismissed 

myself left feeling alone with a void in my heart

hit with a dart

thrown by my chemical sweetheart

clearing my head of sloppily illustrated junkie art

running barefoot on glass struggle to get a headstart

dont stop until i run into the sky

i break down and cry

my heroin days make me want to die

chin up i wipe my beaten bruised eyes

All of my truth

Had been hastily crammed in to the back of an old Honda Odyssey

A black futon in a silver coffin

Soaring across an asphalt ocean

What stories could she have lent to me

In the state that I was in

Unsure of who was using who

We continued forever onwards

Occasionally pausing 

To exchange knowing and suspicious glances

At the ghosts we just couldn’t shake

There was an angel at the wheel

Not like you would think though

As she cranked it, suddenly, to the left

Her track marks began to glow

And coalesce 

I began to wonder if they were singing

What kind of a song

Would her track marks sing

If I had been a little more aware

The parking lot that we would sleep in that night

Was inviting in its way

Serene in its openness

Underwhelming in its privacy

We stole batteries from walgreens

To fund the flashlight

There was a poem that I desperately wanted her to read

Before the speed wore off

There just doesn’t seem to be enough time

I reached out for the moon

But had to stop at the window

Redirected, my hands found the shaving kit

Chalk full of ways to ward off

The oppression that was stalking the sun",1530480448.0

I have a big glass every morning and it boosts all my doses through the day (oral and rectal). It's becoming super hard to find, though. I know there have been growing and supply problems for the last couple of years-- Ocean Spray started mixing their WGFJ with pink about two years ago-- but up until now generic/store-brands have been readily available. 

Until yesterday! It wasn't at my normal supermarket. I went to another chain, not there. I went to Whole Foods which sometimes carries Tropicana, nope. No frozen concentrate, no actual white grapefruits. I am 20 seconds away from ordering some WGFJ online. In the meantime I'm taking cimetidine and what little quinine there is in tonic but it's not the same.   


But I read somewhere that Pomegranate juice may effect/inhibit the same enzymes as WGFJ, though there's been far less research on it. Has anyone heard this? Has anyone tried this? I know some folks are skeptical of potentiation or it doesn't work for them, but not having WGFJ basically means I'm not getting high.   


I'll probably end up just trying it out, at least a bottle, but it's not cheap so I figured I'd ask if anyone here has given it a shot.

Worst part is having to pretend I’m not going through it because my problems will then go from bad to catastrophic when I’m told to bounce 

No lie on Day 2 my mom asked if I’d mow the lawn and I had to agree to not set off any alarms. I came in from that shit an hour later looking and feeling like I just ran an ultra marathon. I think my symptoms peaked around 60 hours in because that shit had no legs

But by no means do I feel out of the woods. My chances of sleeping at all tonight are 0 and this cold sweating panick seems inescapable. So the problem: I came into a surprise 20$. I got money on my debit but I can’t touch it for a couple reasons. I was just given this 20$ and the smart thing would be to dip off to Walmart and buy that 72 count lope and a couple Xans from my buddy to end this insomnia streak

But come on. What I really want to do is ask the dboy if he’ll do 3 bags for 20$ which he will. So my question is will doing a couple bags today erase this weekend from hell I just went through? I just wanna do a fat shot tomorrow morning at 9:01 when my mom goes to work and then sleep until 4:59 when she gets back. But not at the expense of  starting all over 

Any feedback would be appreciated. I’ll be heading to my stepfathers birthday party soon who I can’t even stand when I’m high let alone kicking. Jesus ",1530466482.0

Also  traded two car seats, and a stroller. when he started some candy gig every morning he would give me a list and I would come with bags full of candy to trade for dope. I would bring between $100 and $200 worth of candy and usually get about 75% retail value in dope. I was fucking amazed how long we kept this up.

Usually i use methadone as I'm prescribed it and more is available. 90-100mg is usually good pain relief and 130-140mg is a good buzz, each lasting pretty much the entire day

First of I should say I took a several day break from methadone so that it wouldnt interfere with the high. I got some cheap Dillies a few days ago. Last time I had them it took about 30mg insufflated to feel high (not nodding but nicely sedated and pain relief)

The other day I bought 60mg. I plugged the first 24mg, banged the next 24mg, and snorted probably 12mg and I still wasnt high. There was maybe 2-3 hours I felt like i might nod and obviously good feelings after banging some of them. Am I broken? Luckily I recently made some breakthroughs with my pain disorder and I think I could take a couple of weeks off if i had some ketamine and maybe a few benzos.

I guess a possible explanation is that plugging didnt work very well for me. The day before I had IMed 30mg and it was noticeable but not strong, thats why I chose to increase the dose that day.",1530451646.0

None of them knew what w-4s are. They didn't know about property taxes, that a mortgage isn't another word for homeowners, that they could vote for politicians more local than the senators and governor, they thought their buddy who just got hired would get paid vacation, benefits, and over time was always double your base pay by law.  

They didn't know you had to file taxes each year, obviously the govt like does that for us bro.  "" I dk man, maybe you didn't sign up for the program or something, my parents don't do them for me. After all its not like the gov't can afford people to look into that shit and come get me. I've been doing it for 7 years since I'm 25 now.""

This was the smart one they deffered too. None of them have had real jobs other than with their parents or getting paid for chores.

They think I was lying, making this shit up.  They're too young and ignorant to acknowledge their stupidity.  Now I know why my buddy's gf is always silent around our circle.  She has no idea what we're talking about.

    In August I started the Vivitrol program(court ordered), so I haven’t been able to do any opiates, or at least the ones I wanna do, cuz I don’t care for subs all tht much.
   Well to fill the void I’m been pleasing my needle fetish with other drugs like 3f-a-pvp, mdma, and ketamine.  But more than any of those, my best friend and enemy, cocaine.
   It’s really starting to take a toll, especially since I hav solid money coming in and no Wd’s to deal with, so I’m not burning thru my bank account.
   Now I kno it doesn’t have physical wd’s, but I personally think it makes up for tht with extreme mental wd’s.  
   Just wanted to say to anyone curious about IV cocaine... ur gonna love it,  but it’s prob gonna fuck u up.  Pretty sure I had a stroke like 2 years ago.  But thts a story for another day.  Be careful y’all !!!

That shit is scary.,"I am service coordinator for our local homeless population. Been around the block many times at the age of 51. Somehow never got into opiates and am very grateful for that. Anyhoo, this chick was obviously high all day. Spent most of her time on the nod, breathing fine and responsive. I didn't want to ruin her high so just kept an eye on her.

Later in the day she must have redosed because instead of nodding she flat out used the table as a pillow. Now, I may know a thing or two, but I've never actually experienced an OD. I have Narcan training which tells you how to use it, but, not when. 

So when I lifted her head off the table she held it up on her own and mumbled some shit, so, alive and breathing, right??? I stupidly let this go on another 1/2 hour. 

Again, I lifted her head, shook her and loudly announced that if she didn't come out of this I was going to ruin her high with Narcan. Only when she didn't respond to the threat of losing her high did I make the decision to use the Narcan.

Administered the Narcan. Called 911. Nothing fucking happens. She didn't magically come to like they said she would in the training. 3 minutes go by. 4, 5, no change. The paramedics arrive and take over. Still no change. I'm panicking, wondering if my inaction killed this girl. Things did not get better when the EMT asked me how long I waited, seeming to insinuate I waited too long . . .

WHAT THE FUCK!! She was breathing. How the fuck am I supposed to know the difference between someone being high as fuck and goddamn respiratory distress!!! 

She was alive when she was taken away and she better be alive tomorrow. This was my first OD. Not truly knowing what to do and when is a terrible feeling. If she lives I will resent her. If she doesn't I will relive my actions for the rest of my life and blame myself for not acting quicker.

The reason I'm posting this here is not to shame or blame any of you for anything, just to offer my perspective. This is one of my favorite subs for a number of reasons. I like to think you guys helped me to understand things better. Nevertheless, as informed as I believed myself to be, regardless of whether this poor girl lives or dies, this EXPERIENCE WAS FUCKING TERRIFYING FOR ME. I read sometimes about users treating their latest OD casually, even laughing them off because they keep Narcan on hand. Well, as I said, I may not be a user but I genuinely believed I'd know what to do and when, but, I didn't and I'm pissed off as hell that this is what it has come to, that some dumb ass like me is the difference between living and dying for some of you. That is not fair at all.

Please, don't put normies in that position. It sucks. It's unfair. It is potentially life destroying, both for the junkie and the normie. 

I asked why the Narcan didn't work and didn't get an actual answer. I don't know if she is still alive or not. I won't know anything until tomorrow at the earliest. Until then I get to spend the night questioning my decisions and wondering . . . 

Again, just wanted some of you to hear the experience of a non-user tasked with attending to an OD with no previous experience. And again, it is terrifying . . . and unfair, both to myself as well as the user. Fuck this goddamn scourge. Thank you for your time and be safe out there. ",1530414192.0

(My embarrasingly profitable winter of 2016) LONGREAD part 1,"Some of you guys may remember reading the story of my $32,000 scum up. (check my post history) If I had even a fraction of the writing talent of some other members of this sub, I would share some of my stories way more often, because this type of stuff is the reason I love this sub. I feel like the only way I can properly tell the story is in its entirety. So this will definitely get pretty long, so settle in for a long one. (I'm on mobile and tried mybest to format properly)

I don't act like such a piece of shit crumb anymore because I am now on suboxone maintenance. I highly recommend it to hopeless chronic relapsers such as myself. I'm actually a productive member of society now for the first time ever. So I don't scam/rob people anymore. I also feel like it's important to note that karma caught up to me BIG TIME and I definitely paid for all my scumbaggery that you're about to hear. Anyways, onto the story.

November 2016, 5am. I was supposed to see my PO at 8am, but I knew I would fail my urine test. Instead of trying to get into treatment or beg my PO for mercy, I decided to abscond. This meant I would have a warrant for my arrest and eventually I would have to go to jail, but I figured I'd make it through the winter before that happened, and I wanted to keep getting high

So at 5am I head to the city to grab some dope and forget about the consequences that were eventually coming my way. I had just gotten paid so I grabbed two bundles and some powder. While I was looking for a secluded spot to park and get high, my friend D called me on messenger and invited me to his uncle's house. He sent me the address and it was about five minutes from the hood I had just grabbed in. So I decided to go.

D has always been the biggest junkie I've ever met and at this point in time he had no job (he never has a job lol) and a seriously viscous habit. Since he was so close I figured I would go there to enjoy my drugs in relative safety and be JJ for D. I figured he was probably sick af if he is calling me at five a.m to see if I'm in the city. I had never met D's uncle or been to the house but I assumed I would be sneaking in and hiding our drug use. I couldn't have been more wrong. The scene I walked into at Owens house was really bizarre. I see three guys sitting around a table. D, Owen, and Owens friend Mac. It's a typical rowhouse, but this one is a duplex. Owen owned both, the first floor and basement is a  1 bdrm apartment where  Owen lived, and the second floor was a  1 bdrm apartment where  Owen used to have tenants but was now abandoned, and not really liveable anymore. It wasn't immediately clear that this was a full on drug house, but when D and Mac moved in, that's what they turned it into. These three guys were all sitting around the table, stuck, with a shit load of crack and paraphernalia. D explained that they had been up all night smoking crack and they would appreciate it if I could sell them a bundle so they could come down nicely off of all the hard they smoked. I hadn't smoked hard before, but that was about to change

When D pulled out a wad of money, I was shocked. This kid never has money, and any drugs he gets, is done immediately. He tells me between the three of them they cleared almost $600 that night!! I didn't really believe him, so I asked them to bring me into the scheme. Once he did, I didn't return home for six more months lol.

Everyone on r/opiates is familiar with whisper scammers. And most people in America are familiar with catfishing. D was basically combining the two. He had set up multiple accounts on the app ""MeetMe"" with pictures of his ex girlfriends. Since they were exes from before D was a junkie felon POS These girls were all pretty hot. A little too hot IMHO, but since he knew these girls and dated them before, he had pictures that weren't on the internet anywhere. The catfish profiles he set up where really elaborate and well done. They were all at least over a month old. 

He opened up the app to show me how it worked, and as soon as he did there were literally HUNDREDS of thirsty dudes hitting ""Gia"" up. It was really eye opening to see what girls have to deal with in their DMs. New messages (and tons of dick pics Lmao) came in CONSTANTLY. a legitimately overwhelming number of messages that would be impossible to keep up with. He narrowed it down by looking for people that were close to our city, that had a car, and that responded positively when we asked if they got high. Starting with weed and eventually asking about percs and Molly. A ton of dudes fit that criteria, and the majority of them were complete fuckboys who's opening line was something like ""Damn bb you so fine, I wanna spoil you and splurge on you, I'll treat you right I'm a good dude."" (FUCKING LOL) seriously guys, it was comical how cringey/desperate and cliche 98% of these dudes were.... I digress....

D, Owen and Mac were all working separate profiles. The first goal was to get guys to come over to ""smoke, Netflix&Chill, and see what happens"". With an agreement that they would buy or split some weed/molly/percs from ""Gia's"" ""neighbor"". We would either give a random address close by, or give the address for the abandon apartment upstairs. Getting guys to agree to this wasn't as hard as you may think. I was convinced that nobody was dumb enough to fall for it, especially with how common the phrase ""catfishing"" had become, but honestly the hardest part was just pretending to be a flirty interested girl and not coming across desperate for money or shady. But even if the guys noticed some red flags, a ton of them ignored it! The scam could go a few different ways depending on how the conversation went, sometimes it was sex for money, sometimes it was having them buy drugs from us, or even them trading their weed or pills for our weed or pills. 

It's really important to point out right here that we didn't actually have any real drugs! We used the age old oregano and bayleaves for weed. A glued piece if folded paper for dabs. And some random heart pills for percs or opana. Random supplement capsules for Molly's. Since meetme is ostensibly a dating or friend finding app, a solid percentage of our possible victims weren't very educated when it comes to drugs, and if they were, we were able to tell during the convo and change the scam accordingly.

So in no time at all, D has a guy on his way over to get high and chill with Gia. (At fucking 8am no less! God Damn are guys thirsty and desperate!) When the guy gets to the address we provided, D hands the phone off to Owen. Grabs 4 mollies and 5 ""dubs"" of the fake weed. And runs out to meet the poor bastard who fell into the trap. Owen texts the dude and stalls him, saying he is putting the dogs away, or putting her hair up. Whatever. didnnt matter, he just needed to buy a couple of minutes. Then once D gets to the house, he explains he's the neighbor coming to sell gia her drugs, but he's late for work. He tells the guy that gia's door is around back. This whole time Owen is texting the guy saying the same thing. This puts the victim at ease because D clearly isn't the one texting him.... because he's right in front of him. This makes him believe the girl is actually real. HA! They had it down to a fucking science. D then returns to the house with $200 dollars. I was floored. There's no way people are this stupid! There's now way it can be this easy! If he really just made $200 this early in the morning, imagine a Friday night! Right then and there I was all in. I figured I could make some serious money with my natural born bullshitting and this new scam. The next six months were absolutely insane. And if I didn't witness it first-hand, I wouldn't.believe this.scam.actually worked. But it did. It worked insanely well, the money started really rolling in. The meetme scam became all of our full-time jobs.

So I’m at a stage where my double life is starting to intertwine too much, and I feel impending doom. We do know what they say about all good things! Even if they’re fake and temporary “good things.”

I convinced everyone a few years ago I was clean. Even my boyfriend (recovering poly abuser) who I’ve lived with for 2 years (loved for many) still has no idea I am always high. He’s been using on weekends with me since dealing with a couple deaths, and he’s starting to feel some withdrawal on mondays. He deserves better than this. I deserve better than this. We have both come so far, and I feel like we are pushing shit to the absolute limit. If our families found out...ugh, devastating.

I don’t want to lose everything to this drug. I know I’ve been lucky for this long, but I’m almost out of it. We are in the market for a house, just got approved for a loan...I feel like we cannot purchase a house while active addiction. It’s just time to fucking stop. We have nothing to show for the money we do have. 


So now we are asking each other. “How” do we stop? That’s the hard part! 

I’m sorry if this is all over the place. I did smoke more weed than I’m used to smoking so yea I’m probably rambling but if you made it through thanks for reading!

I guess it's super fucking easy to do. all I did was say that some guy must be a troll bc most people in the community aren't that retarded. 

this after he tried to invalidate my previous comment by going through my history and saying something like ""this coming from a guy who talks about IM'ing heroin.""

fucking whatever. that sub sucks now anyway since you can't talk about a long list of random shit after the rule change a few months ago or whatever.

anyway, how's everybody's weekend going so far? I'm sitting good for now. I went to pick up yesterday morning and when I got there she wasn't answering her phone or texts or anything. I even went and knocked on her door like she told me to do in that situation and no answer. so I went and sat at a grocery store around the corner and proceeded to blow her the fuck up while listening to NPR and fucking around on reddit. I told myself I'd give her an hour before I gave up and left. any other day I would have stayed as long as it took because she's normally reliable as fuck and I knew that she'd eventually wake the fuck up and serve me... but before I left the house I agreed to bring home some BBQ for the fam for lunch around noon.

I got there at like 10:30 and by the time 11:15 rolls around I've called her a total of 32 times. my dad had just texted asking if I'd be home soon, so I told myself I'd call one more time and if she didn't answer on the 33rd time I would just leave and maybe come back later, which would have fucking sucked because it's a 45 minute drive there and back. I put the car in reverse and snapped on the seat belt as the phone started ringing, already anticipating that goddamn ""this is the voicemail box of..."" but after 4 rings she fucking answers the phone.

she's all, ""...hellloooo?"" super fucking sleepy and shit.

""yooo, dude, what the fuck. you ok?""

""I fell asleep... what time is it? 11:15... oh fuck.""

""yeah dude, I'm around the corner at the grocery store. can I come thru?""

""yeah im, how long have you been here? I'm so sorry""

""shit like an hour. I'll be there in 2 minutes.""

""alright, yeah. cool.""

jesus fucking christ, perfect timing. I mean not really perfect timing since I had to like 45 min. but at least I wasn't going home empty handed. there's literally nothing worse than going home empty handed after a 45 minute drive. well I guess you could get pistol whipped and robbed or something, and that'd be worse. but I make it a point not to have to go to the ghetto to cop. my connects are usually in fairly nice areas that were recently gentrified. it helps living in one of the biggest cities in the country though.

anyway long story still pretty fucking long, she hooked me up with an extra like .4 or something for the inconvenience. definitely worth the wait for that. it's cool though I wasn't mad, she's a super fucking reliable and honest connect and this kind of shit almost never happens with her so I can definitely forgive the two times a month that I have to wait more than 10 minutes.

so I went on my merry way and picked up a fat order of bbq for the family before going home and munching down.

A few years ago I tried opiates for the first time and have done it maybe 10 times since then. I've only really tried Tramadol which gives me an incredibly feeling for an entire day (for whatever reason, IR and ER seems to not matter in regards to duration; only in regards to when it kicks in).

Anyhow, I am supposed to be having a great time tonight with a very close friend of mine. I was unable to get us our usual opiate since he was out of stock, but that didn't keep him from offering me something else; oxycodone.

More specifically, it's Reltebon Oxycodone 10 mg ER.

Now, I've done a fair bit of research on it and it seems as if Reltebon Oxycodone is one of the worse brands in regards to this, because you can't break the ER by crushing them. Furthermore, I've heard some reports of these pills just being inferior to any other pills of the same type.

Regardless, I've got them and I've got 10 of them and I plan to use them. However, this is (was) my first time, but after reading up on it, I decided to give it a spin yesterday with 2 x 10 mg's of these in the morning.

Compared to Tramadol, this was very underwhelming. I didn't feel any euphoria - I was just feeling a little nauseated and very much annoyed at everything around me. I felt my neck being a little tigther than usual and I got a very very minor headache.

I'm a relatively big dude and when I use Tramadol, I need 300-400 mgs to feel really good. 

I've heard Oxycodone is supposed to be so much superior, but it just didn't feel like it to me. 

So, the question here is really; how am I gonna approach this tonight if I want to get a good kick out of it? If I take 4 x 10 mg of these - will I be having a good time once it kicks in? Is it true that I can't crush them and turn them into IR? 

As a site note, I got my hands on some Codeine pills with 25 mg in them. I've never tried them either, so I went ahead and popped 2 x 25 mg 4 hours ago to see if my body could handle them (I was told this was a good idea before experimenting with them), so I have this option available to me as well.

IV drug use- heroin,"So I got out of rehab in March and I’ve been shooting up pretty much ever since. I smoked it the first couple of weeks but then switched to the needle. 

I’m finally at the point where most of my veins are no longer visible. Used up everything on my hands and feet. When I take a hot shower or exercise sometimes some unused ones pop out but most of them are in hard spots to get a good angle. Like on the side by the elbow where it’s hard to put the needle in and see the angle. 

What do y’all do at this point? I’ve heard a lot of people say it takes a year to ruin all their veins. I know if I took a couple of weeks off they would come back but that’s hard to do at this point seeing how addicted I am. 

It’s so frustrating and I actually missed 3 shifts at work last week Bc I couldn’t hit in time and I didn’t wanna go into work dope sick. I started at 12 one day, left the house at 11 and didn’t get a hit until like 1:45. Seriously almost 3 hours of poking myself trying to get in a vein. 

Any suggestions on how to find hidden veins, how to bring veins back or anything else like that? 

Please help!!! And I know the best solution is to quit heroin but that’s not happening tonight or tomorrow and I need to be able to hit. I’ve been calling around to rehabs so once I take care of some stuff at work I’ll be seeking treatment. Just need to figure something out until then.  ",1530354679.0

I went to the gas station today to pick up a couple packs of smokes. The line is so long, it goes from the cashier to the door. I take my place in line, but it was a weird line, people kinda scattered around. 

A large, red faced man was standing next to me, and I wasn’t sure if he had just walked up or if he had been hidden behind an aisle waiting, so I waved my hand, indicating he could get in front of me. 

He took that as an indication that I was his new friend. He started talking about his day, waving his hands and getting very close to me. I’d back up, he’d close the gap. I could smell alcohol on his breath, and a bottle of something was sticking out of his pocket. 

Now, I’m not a large girl. I’m maybe 5’2, 5’3 tops. Everyone else in the gas station was ignoring him, avoiding eye contact. I was standing there wishing I’d done the same. 

He kept reaching out to touch me, grab my shoulder, my hand, and I kept dodging him, but there was someone behind me and I couldn’t back up any more than I already had. 

Finally the line moved forward and when I went to step forward, I felt a hand on my arm. A man that literally looked like junkie Jesus stepped in front of me, using himself as a barrier between me and the drunk asshole. He had long, brown hair, and visible track marks along his arms and hands. 

He talked to the drunk guy, sidestepping and blocking him every time he tried to get back at me. 

Finally the drunk guy was able to pay for his smokes and left, and my junkie Jesus graciously let me ahead again to pay for my smokes and get the hell out of there. 

TL;DR: met a real JJ who saved me from a drunk man’s creepy advances ",1530354644.0

I eventually found out that his dumb ass was trying to steal shit from someone's backyard and the homeowner caught him so he ran.  He left his wallet and phone in the car and ditched me.  

The cops search his car and then asked me if they can search my backpack. I said no. They asked why and I said because I have rights.  He searched it anyways and found my .3g of blk and a scale.  I get arrested.  The care was impounded.  I spend 3 days in jail before I get a PR bond and was released at 3am this morning.

we were stripped from having mod privileges for violating terms of service or something so i have to use my private room apparently? it's the same except it has the youtube player and actual moderation. repeat, new room link, same old chat.   

for those who are unaware tc is a video chat platform that while not perfect, seems to work well for phones and browsers alike. this room is for hanging out, listening to music, and specifically harm reduction so no one has to use alone. it is unaffiliated with r/opiates and its moderators and has its own rules and etiquette. here are the revised and updated rules:  

1) don't do any sort of -isms, it's just not cool and i run a leftist room. your opinions are welcome but no personal attacks or nasty stuff about groups of people. if you want to be rude, get personal, there's plenty of stuff to say about people without going for low-hanging fruit.  

2) don't make obnoxious noises over the mic, or play music over the chat. the bitrate for the sound channel is like 4, everything sounds like crap unless it's played through the built-in youtube player.  

3) don't dox anyone or take pictures or record the chat, this is a place people come to feel comfortable doing various things and anything that violates privacy results in an instant ban.  

4) guests must pick a unique username. no lurking allowed because people stalk people and shit. aside from these, just don't be rude or a douche.  

also, if you don't like me, or the mods, or the room, or anything else, just don't comment and move on. please don't be a hot mess on here, they're doing a good job. ",1530327312.0

Today while carrying a washing machine down the stairs I lost grip and the whole thing fell down onto my foot, breaking my big toe.
I immediately went into the hospital and after seeing the x-ray image I was so shocked, I had to throw up.

Where there should have been a bone there was nothing but tiny little splinters left. That, combined with the nail that was pushed completely inside the flesh, cutting all the way through to the underside of the toe and the fact that it was squashed thin to about 1.5cm in height, hurt like hell.

I've never been in so much pain before and all they gave me was a script for 100mg Ketoprofen, for which I had to walk to the pharmacy myself.  
I did take it as prescibed but it didn't help whatsoever. I called the hospital and asked if I could get a stronger painkiller which they denied.

Now I've never taken an opiate in my life but I have a friend who's using heroin recreationally. I asked him if I could buy some off him and he came over and gave me .5g for free.  
It's heroin #3, a brown powder, and not very pure. It's propably not cut with fent as there hasn't been a single death because of fent in the whole year in the country I live.

He told me to snort 80-100mg which is about the dose he's usually taking (he uses very sporadically, about twice a month so tolerance shouldn't be a big factor here) but I want to get a second opinion on how much I should take so I'm asking you for advice.

I'm a 21 year old male about 185cm tall and weigh about 65kg. I have a precision scale able to weigh down to 3mg accurately.  
Now I don't want to get too high from this as I have some studying to do; Nothing really difficult but still.  

Thanks in advance!",1530310167.0

- patient is put under general anaesthesia.
- while under general anaesthesia patient is given naltrexone which rapidly flushes out all opiates in the body
- The patient is aroused to extreme discomfort seems however they will find that they have skipped the withdrawal process.

**things i don’t know about it**
- I don’t know how much Anaesthesia  is given but since it is going to have to take at least three days of being on unconscious I can’t see how that is either remotely healthy or how that it is done 

- What drug is used?  (**edit PROPOFOL**) i remembered the name - i guess this is redosed for the duration.

- I have personally seen what happens when naltrexone is given to patient while there awake it essentially puts them in a state of instant withdrawal which includes instant diarrhoea vomiting and all of the symptoms —  while these will be skipped as the patient is unconscious,
 how will they deal with the unpredictability of diarrhoea which is frequent (maybe daily uses of imodium, 8-12mg, i m might have answered my own question) and urination — a  catheter will sort out the urination, something i would despise.

- **the extreme discomfort upon waking**.
when I read this I have the impression that the patient must wake and find themselves in the middle of detox and the last thing they remember was being NOT being in detox.
 if true and therefore the patient is extremely sick I wonder how they counteract this or whether the patient just has to endure it - or given medication to deal with it, maybe sedatives - however after being on propofol and sedatives we know kills, being literally how M. Jackson died ‘m

- when I was reading about it it said that it would only last two days meaning the patient would be out or unconscious under general anaesthesia for two days now in my experience I’m sure in your experience two days is absolutely nowhere near finishing a detox in fact the patient would wake up at probably the worst and most intense part of the withdrawal process.

to me even being forced into unconsciousness with Anastasia 48 hours is extreme and dangerous enough and to be put under general anaesthesia to skip withdrawal you would have to wake them up and stop the Anastasia on day four or five which I think from a medical standpoint would probably kill the patient you cannot be on propofol for that long

That’s The equivalent of having a five day or an operation that lasts way over 100 hours this method confuses me I’ve never heard of it I am completely understand how I could be banned and I’m not sure how it has even ever worked I watched a documentary on Channel 4 once where they did this without Anastasia but with just Benz hours on day three they gave them now tracks alone and it was just pure horror and the worst decision I’ve seen any medical professional make giving, somebody naltrexone loan only on day three just puts them into basically a state of instant withdrawal similar to precipitated withdrawal.

most of the patients hallucinated urinate hemselves shit themselves and Vomitted. All were in extreme pain and since they cannot give any opiates because that will ruin the cold turkey process all they did was apply more benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines do nothing other than help insomnia during opiates dtox.

conclusion: I came across this method while looking for the different remedies for getting over withdrawal obviously there are only three different methods known to man basically there is methadone there is Subutex and there is this recently I’ve heard people talking of Creighton a lot and hope it works very well however in my opinion it just seems like another form of methadone or another subutex situation aka opiate substitution.

I am sure you’re well aware but if you’re not basically although Subutex and methadone both completely remove withdrawal symptoms if you happen to stay on either of these drugs for more than 3 to 4 weeks you become completely addicted to them in the same way that you become addicted to any other obvious and guess what ironically the withdrawal process for both of these drugs is much more harsh on her when itself lasts longer and c-an bemore intense.

before I go back to my Subutex which I found works even at the 4 mg level I have two questions

1) if you take high doses of Subutex even with the tolerance is there really euphoria to be gotten from  it.I’ve only ever taken 4-6 mg she is low dosage because that’s all i ever need, that’s enough for any dope head, doses beyond 14mg are useless - that’s the ceiling.

2) my other question is about kratom - 

 I already have my scepticism about it because I know that it’s just a plant with opioid activity which as far as I am concerned it is just Vicodin or codeine in plant form.... if it activates the opioid receptors then if use consecutively and long enough addiction will ensue. 

3) So I guess I’m asking why has anybody ever needed to be on methadone Subutex for months or even years at a time?  the only reason I can think of is that the drugs  have the ability to stop craving drugs mentally - as well as stopping symptoms physically. 

maybe these people were using the drug to stop the cravings a.k.a. using these drugs not only for physical needs but also to battle the mental addiction that follows physical detox because we all know that the mental addiction is probably harder than the physical addictin￼.

1.) do you need a decent coffe filter? how much paracetamol is it safe to leave in the water without fucking my day up?

2.)im not an addict anymore,(well, still taking meth)  but would this get rid of heroin cravings for my friends? they always turn up asking me to score, saying there dope sick.

It could take up to 9 pokes before I would register and a lot of the times it would come out of the vein. So thats an added bonus on using a bigger guage, it registers a lot easier, so easy in fact that I got that shot in on the first try.

My wife got it and asked “what the hell is this”(writing is all in Chinese).  I looked at these tiny little ampules of something liquidy.  And the top had to be punctured with a needle.  So I did that and smelled it.  Holy shit my mother unknowingly just shipped me 16 ampules of opium.  I told my wife it was a dietary bees wax supplement.  Tonight I’m going to indulge!   It’s funny because my mother is the reason I’ve been mostly clean for the last three years.  She put me in rehab after I went insane from withdrawing from opana, Xanax, and adderall all in a week.  

How do I know it’s opium?  This story is actually better than the above.  

My family lives in the south, and we have a “mountain house” where my fathers side lived since the late 1700s.  In the blue ridge mountains.  My grandma when my sister and I were about 5 and 7, would make us stay up there with her every summer.  So my grandma would always tell us “alright let’s go get my medicine”.   So we would go to this giant poppy field near the house and collect all the pods and stems.  Slash them.  Then the next day we would take all the dried stuff and roll into a ball.  This is what my grandma called “her medicine”, along with moonshine which she made outback the house.  It wasn’t until years later I realized while watching drugs Inc that my beloved grandma was making my sister and I felons by making opium!  

I’m 30 now, and grandma died at 95 a few years ago.  But I guess she started it all!

I lost track of an hour standing in the bathroom...,"Well first of all I wasn't sure if I wanted to finish all of my dope so I could start on subs 12 hours after my last use or when I started feeling funky. If my goal was to finish it, the goal was feasible around 3am but once I got past 4AM it became less reasonable. It meant that I'd have to wait until I was already at work before I could consider taking any sub.


Sometimes after a long bingy day I wake up feeling like I'm carrying training weights. Anyway, I didn't sleep the night before so now although I thought I was awake, I kept nodding off, dozing off and nodding I suppose. Before I knew it, 4:00am is 5:15am. 

Now, I go to the bathroom and am having trouble peeing. It's like when you're in a public restroom and can't push it out except I'm in my own bathroom and nobody is waiting behind me, nor i anyone trying to make small talk while I hold my dick. 


&nbsp;


I get up, I kept nodding off and getting wobbly. I kept walking up as I was making a controlled lean-stumble into the wall. Tripped over my toilet a couple of times. Still, straightened up... stood in the ""I'm peeing"" posture and still waiting. After the cycle repeats -- a combination of sleeplessness and dopiness, I realize that there was a signifigant time jump.  
 
I entered the bathroom at around 5:25 or 5:30am. Now, after what I perceive to be approximately ten minutes, I ovbserve the time is 6:25am. Holy shit, I lost an hour?! So I continue to stand, stumbling periodically -- losing track of five to twenty minute long swaths of time. Finally I get my bearings somewhere [just?] after 6:52am and I finally expel urine.

&nbsp;


Never experienced that before, specifically losing track of time like that whiile standing.                                            Like I said, I think it was mostly sleep deprivation related but it was certainly linked to my continuous consumption of dope that didn't suck since I did not get it from Derrick ""the skimming and seasoning"" middleman.",1530299022.0

I've been dealing with this dude I found via the internet in my city a while back. He asked for a $20 finders fee, which I paid him. No big deal. Gives me a few numbers and vouches for me. A couple of the dudes messaged with me for a bit but then it all just pattered out.

A few months goes by and he hits me up again, saying he's got new people and needs the same finders fee. ""Fool me once"" is in the back of my mind, but he did give me legitimate numbers the first time, so I do it again. Same thing happens. Chat with a few people and it patters out.

Fast forward to today, and he hits me up again. Obviously I tell him that I'm a bit miffed and need to get a solid source before I pay him his damn finders fee. He goes through the apology tour and talks up how he's got great connections now.

It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse.  It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.






The abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. 

My feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark.

Need input on what to do.","I have been on 16mg Suboxone/day for around 6 months now, I take it as prescribed. Didn't use any opiate the entire 6 months besides my subs. I've been doing treatment the entire time as well. On Monday from about 9pm-11pm I relapsed on about 80mg IV black tar heroin. I waited 36 hours, then took my suboxone again. I am about 90% sure I am going to get drug tested tomorrow, and it may or may not affect legal issues I have. My drug test will take place about 80 hours from my last IV heroin use. It is a laboratory GC/MS urine drug screening.

What are my chances of passing this test clean tomorrow morning? I go to treatment at 10am and they do random drug testing, but it's been a while since Ive been tested and I had to skip today to go to court. So I'm sure that will make them want to drug test me.

I have three options, I have cleen pee from about 4 days ago that I froze. I could thaw it out, warm it up, and fake the test. But they might notice that it's older urine. I've faked many drug tests before but this place is quite professional.

My second option is just to call in right now and leave a message letting them know I relapsed. If I know I'm going to get caught, this will be a good way to minimize consequences and hopefully I'm not kicked out of the program since I was honest.

Third option is just to go in and take the test, hoping I pass. Is ~80 hours after IVing about a point of heroin enough time to pass a lab drug screen?",1530247580.0

So, I'm scrolling through Whisper, just bullshitting, laughing at all the desperate posts of people that are craving any sort of sexual encounter. So, while I am doing that, I come across an opiate related post of someone basically saying they have Tar on deck. So, of course me being an addict, I immediately message em. ""Hey, What side of town are you on?"", and not even 5 minutes later, they reply. So, we end up going back and forth for about a day, before I finally end up getting off work, and am driving to meet this guy. He's about 15 minutes from where I am, ""Hell yeah"" is what im thinking. Dude seems legit, even said he would hook me up with a free sack of some other shit he had. ""Nice!"", Finally JJ has blessed me. So, When I get to where we ended up meeting, He doesn't want to meet at my car, cuz he says, ""A sting can happen outside and after this first transaction, then we can meet up where ever"", okay?? Whatever man, I'll come meet you inside. Keep in mind, we are in a VERY public building, with cameras everywhere, security, and also, just an all around crowded place. 

So, we walk to the bathroom and he hands me the so called ""Half""(.5 G), which is in a balloon(Normal packaging around here), before I ever hand him any money, I walk into the bathroom, go to a stall, close the door, and get to opening this balloon. As I'm opening the balloon, I hear someone get into the stall next to mine, say ""Shit"" under his breath, and then walk out. Didn't think anything of it, while im still trying to find the middle of this balloon and foil combination. I eventually get to the middle, which is still just foil, and find nothing in this balloon. So, I get ready to confront this dude, and when I walk out the bathroom, he's no where to be found. So at THIS point, i'm thinking this was a set up to get me arrested, so as soon as I saw that window, I DIPPED the fuck out of there. Damn near ran to my car, and high tailed away from the spot. 

So, here is the good part of this whole situation, I end up calling another friend of mine, to help me out. So I drive over to them, pick em up, and go to meet their dude. Dude comes through, and ends up introducing their dealer to me. SICK! Just as I wanted from the beginning, and the sack is 10/10 on the dope scale. So, All in all, I didn't lose anything, and ended up gaining an awesome dealer. I can tell you this, I will never use Whisper again.

I use with my boyfriend so between the two of us, there’s no dope that’s ever left unaccounted for that we could stumble across at a later date or something. I’ve felt blessed by my dealers giving me free dope but still,,, that’s not JJ in my mind. 

Anyway, my boyfriend and I are on our way to meet our dealer and we stop at a gas station a few blocks away to get some cash. I sent my boyfriend inside to get the money and as I’m sitting in the car I decide to take a few things to the trash. I step out of the truck and see this small baggie laying on the ground with what looks like some unused cottons inside of it. I quickly pick it up and pocket it before anyone sees me dropping drug paraphernalia everywhere, toss a few things in the trash, and get back in the truck. I remember the baggie, wondering how I managed to drop my cottons outside since I remember putting away my works. As I pull it out of my pocket I realize these aren’t my cottons. I picked up a baggie of six blue A 215s that some poor dope fiend must have lost!

So there you have it fam... my run in with JJ this evening! Not a *huge* find but it definitely made our night a little better!

How is everyone else doing this evening?

——

I am happy to report, all is well!  As I mentioned in an update in the other post, my boyfriend is super friendly with Junkie Jesus, and got a line on a kind of distant acquaintance of his who *also* is prescribed pinks.  My boyfriend called him and basically said “I know this is gonna sound weird but...” and gave him the whole story.

The guy was happy to come over and help us out by *lending* us his pills for the duration of the appointment!  Is that not the coolest move ever? Seriously, the way people look out for each other really warms my heart!  I sat and chatted with him throughout our neighbors visit, and I am so glad we got to meet. He’s a great guy, and we are glad to call him a friend now.

It turns out our Neighbor didn’t have to *go to* an appointment after all, but they actually had someone come out to the house to check on him!  Of course that means that he wouldn’t have been able to just not show up or stall, so that’s some interesting info that might be of use to someone.

Obviously I wasn’t there for the actual visit, but he said that the woman who came out was actually pretty nice.  As I mentioned before, he has never been in any trouble, so they had no reason to treat him as anything other than a cancer patient who needs his medication.

They knew when his prescription was last filled, and did ask to see his bottle. She wrote down some numbers from his label on to her form, which of course wasn’t a problem because he put the pills in his original bottle for the visit.  She shook the bottle and took the off the cap to look at them, but she didn’t actually pull them out and count them.  Our neighbor said that the fact that he had pills to show her gave him enough confidence that he never gave her any reason to doubt him, because he was never shifty or uncomfortable.  Maybe for that reason, a drug test never came up, even though it was mentioned in the phone call from what I hear.

He did ask her what the visit was all about, feigning genuine curiosity.  He said the whole visit was kind of a blur, so he’s not entirely sure exactly what she said, but her answer made it sound like she was there to check up on the pharmacy as opposed to checking up on him.

Anyway, as I said everything is perfect now.  Moving forward, we discussed with him that his next prescription he should hold onto, so that he always has them available for a situation like this if it comes up again.

I want to thank all of you for your advice and well wishes during this nail-biter of a situation.  It’s such a comfort to me that even “people like us” have a place to turn for advice when we need it. You guys are the best, and I’m glad I was able to come back with good news!",1530233866.0

A couple of weeks ago I picked up an eighth of some really good ECP. It was brown and powdery, but it felt as if it had been wetted. Little bits would clump together and it was soft, also kind of cold to the touch. I would describe it as fluffy.

Despite my initial reaction it actually ended up being really good and it was much more forgiving of my nose than most batches. It didn't irritate it as much and I wasn't dealing with the usual stuffiness I get after sniffing for a couple of days.

A day or so after getting it someone told me about how some dealers will use drops of vinegar for weight and smell to their product. I don't know if this is the case with what I had, or if this is even a common thing. However:

I was wondering earlier today, would it be possible to add a drop or two of water/vinegar/etc. and drying it out to make it fluffier, like the stuff I had a couple weeks ago? Does anyone know how I'd go about doing this? Or was it more likely that the dope I had was fluffier/softer as a result of its synthesis?",1530232288.0

[take a look at these ](https://imgur.com/a/hZYuohP)

so my friend heard knocking outback, she went to check it out and seen nothing. she also felt like someone was there. she started taking photos to use her flash to look around, which resulted in these pictures. she also lives directly in front of Corpsewood Manor, where devil worshipping and murders occurred. 

to me, the first pic looks like it’s starting to form. the second pic looks like apparitions. and the third pic I just circled what I see. 

Do u guys believe in ghosts/ spirits? Do you believe in the afterlife and paranormal? I’m a bit of a skeptic when it comes to God, and there can’t be a God without the Devil, so I guess I’m not sure if I believe in him either. I’m not sure what I believe in when it comes to a higher power, which might be why I have always failed in trying to 12 steps haha, but personally, I definitely do believe in spirits. although i’m not sure what happens after death. 

I’m interested in seeing what everyone thinks. Do you guys even see anything in those pics? If so, what do you see? someone mentioned seeing several children. and then some people say it’s just a camera smudge, or a reflection. but mind you, she wasn’t around any mirrors or windows and was aiming directly at a big open field. 

again - sorry if this is off topic but this is where i always post and read. the only forum really. i’m also interested in what my opiate friends think, because i think most of us opiate peeps have the capacity to think outside the box and be open minded, whereas more of the “normal” people can be pretty close minded, arrogant, and can’t think anything beyond life.

 I’m not sure how because I know it’s not in production anymore so I think it just must’ve been saved in bulk before it got stopped.
I know it’s not over in America anymore even though in America Oxy is massive and in the in Europe Oxy is very rare. 
**am i right btw? do usa only get the OP formula now and can ONLY swallow and just deal with the shitty prolonged time attachment**
As u know all you do with prolonged OC is smash up the pill and the duration aspect is broken.

anyone know the real deal why over here we still get the OC? in fact thats all we get - i think i just might have realised - it’s because of the oxy boom in the usa right? And in the UK there is zero problem with oxy usage, it’s rarely prescribed and hard to find on the street, and all we have is OC.

I just got an amazing deal of 120 mg for around $70 (2 x 60mg) pills  — and it’s OC formula.

 I’m just wondering what’s the best way to use it to get the best Thai I am Magent eating some and then snorting small amounts on top?

She has surgery yesterday for her endometriosis and when they opened her up she was completely filled with black, evil cancer.  The Dr's got as much as they could out but it has spread to her colon, bladder and anal area.  She's only 32.

So onto my question...

If you knew you were terminally ill, would you stay on your sobriety path or start using again?  She is a recovering pill and H addict and has been sober for several years now.  She does not want to take any opiates and wants to leave this earth as sober and clean as she can.  I'm so worried about her and her pain levels as it is but I have to respect her wishes.  She did receive IV pain meds after the surgery but is insisting that she isn't given any more.

For me, personally, I would take everything they offered me and just ride out my last days as high as I could get.
Blissfully unaware of things to come.
