i miss cambodia. But all things gotta end to it.

I dont wanna talk too much about this part for various reasons, but taking a few rocks on the plane was stupidly easy (and easily stupid). Because doing nothing but chilling while nodding on a hammock or something is just way too good, I knew I wouldn't be tapering off heroin in cambodia successfully or to the extent it would make a big difference in WD after stopping heroin even with all the OTC pills I had. Shooting up habit is just. Way too good.. Anyways, I had a bit of cambodian rocks and a few spliffed homerolled cigs with Cambodian weed on me.


Right before i took off to get into the actual inside of the airport, I made a stop at the bathroom. Disclaimer: try not to use single stall bathrooms with like wheelchair accessibility and shit cause they don't get cleaned thoroughly as often as the main bathrooms do. It's pretty easy to tell. Lots of cockroaches. In a public bathroom. At the airport. Well I'm in there already, trying to get rid of the last bits of opium and bags I hadnt washed before I get onto the plane. I put some of those carbonating tablet things you put into water and it has flavors and shit, cause I like those and they had magnesium supplements like that at a pharmacy. Magnesium potentiates kratom afaik and even if it's placebo i do personally feel like it goes well with heroin too. I get that yellow bubbly drink in a plastic disposable medium sized waterbottle, take some opium with it, and i was just going to sip on that magnesium drink but it looked way too much like piss to carry it out of a private stalled bathroom. Tastes just like lemons. Shouldnt have been a pussy chugging that in the stall instead of proudly carrying that outside sipping as i walk out.

Got lots of stories to tell, some fun, some not at all fun.

What kind was this to be?","Well it's all come down to this. 3 years fucking with hydro/oxy then 10 years riding the H train, hundreds of thousands of dollars spent, two felonies that got reduced to misdemeanors (thank god), 90 days in patient a while back, the loss/sale of all my possessions and many of my relative's, driving my family into financial ruin, pretty much killing my father with all the shit I've put him through (he's in the hospital right now with heart failure), lots of ruined relationships, huge damage to my heart and circulatory system (you literally can't find a vein on my entire body), and it's all come down to this... One last shot before I intentionally let myself slip into withdrawal, all so I can get on methadone tomorrow. 

I recently moved to a new state so I can take care of my father, and he's been spending every dime he gets from social security to keep me well, so someone is there to care for him. We already received an eviction notice in our first month here because all the rent money went to keeping me from being dopesick. Landlord is paid now, so hopefully that's fixed, but I have a car about to be repossessed, and bills piling up for everything else, which of course can't be paid. I've tried bupe many times, and while it helped me with the initial withdrawal symptoms it did fuck-all for the cravings. Every time I did it, it was only a matter of days or weeks before I eventually caved and went back on heroin. I received methadone the one time I did in-patient treatment, and found it to work much better for me in terms of curbing the cravings. Plus at this point I'm not even thinking about what it will be like coming off of it, because knowing myself that will be quite a ways off, if ever frankly. I've been on dope half my life, I don't really know how to live any differently, so this is going to be tough. Especially with all the other stresses in my life, no job, no friends, bills all due, and the fact that my father will almost for sure be dead in the next year or so, and he has no life insurance or a penny in the bank, so I'm homeless when that happens unless I can start working.

I can't do it anymore, even though I want to, if I am ever going to have a shot at truly cleaning myself up this is it, because if I fuck this up I'm 99% sure I'm going to die in the streets as a homeless junkie. I have no safety-net left whatsoever. Plus this new state I moved to is a fucking joke, everyone is just a lame-ass middle, and the dope is absolutely horrid, so I'm pretty much killing myself and my family in order to pay for the worst heroin on earth, and enrich a bunch of other scumbag addict fucks who wouldn't piss on me if I was on fire. I made this account as an alt for this and other ""naughty"" subreddits, but I've lurked here for a long time on my main and I empathize with the stories here so much, I'm just desperate to find any amount of support or encouragement because I'm super worried, and scared, about all this shit going on in my life. So that's it, hopefully somebody read my wall of text because I feel like I'm talking to myself. It's all lead up to this, one last shot of absolute garbage dope tonight so I can go in sick tomorrow morning, and here she is in all her awful glory: https://anonimage.net/image/YHX07nEES8 .

I've experimented with various drugs quite a bit, but I've always been a pothead above anything else. Last year in the spring, I was preparing to leave my part-time job in search of something full-time, and took a break from weed to be able to pass a pre-employment drug test. I was so bored, and I wasn't old enough to drink yet, so I thought it was a good time to mess around with something that wouldn't take so long to filter out of my body. I'd experimented once with heroin in high school, and it didn't do much other than make me throw up and fall asleep. I knew it had to be better than that if so many people become addicted to it, so I decided to give it another shot (not literally, I've never used needles). I sourced a gram of decently high quality black tar heroin and started by smoking it off foil like I had my first time around, which ended about the same way as it did back then. I then moved onto dissolving it in a minute amount of water in a bottle cap and snorting it. This worked pretty well, but I couldn't handle the taste as it dripped down my throat, so I decided to try inserting my heroin water in an orifice whose pathways have no chance of crossing taste buds. At this point, my dosage was the same as when I started - about 25mg. I got an eyedropper, dissolved my dose in a little extra water, and put it up my ass, legs up against the wall. This was amazing! It was more effective than snorting or smoking, I didn't experience anywhere near as much nausea, and I didn't have to taste it. I began doing this every day after work, and my required dosage began rising. A few weeks in, I was beginning to run low (at this point I was at around 75mg), so I decided to quit the daily thing and save it for weekends. My first day without heroin was pretty uneventful, until I went to bed, when I noticed that I was struggling to fall asleep. No worries, I'll just plug some heroin, I'm sure that'll put me out; It did, and I fell asleep. The next night, I encountered the same problem, so I went to prepare another sleep dose, and it suddenly hit me: *oh. I've become dependent*. The next few days were anxious ones, as I restarted my daily use, knowing that I was probably about to face a fairly unpleasant withdrawal, and cursing myself for not having enough self-control to taper off with what I had left. 

I wasn't a big enough user to get ""sick"". I felt fairly normal during the day after I ran out. The real problem was the fucking restless leg syndrome that suddenly kicked in right before I went to bed. RLS was a bit of a misnomer in my case, because while my legs felt horrible, it was significantly worse in my arms. Restless leg/arm syndrome was one of the most unpleasant feelings I've ever experienced in my life, and I honestly cried multiple times in bed after tossing and turning for hours on end, desperate to get some sleep; to add insult to injury, I always woke up with serenely still legs and arms, wishing that I could sleep for another few hours to make up for those I'd missed. I made the mistake of using Benadryl to knock me out, twice, which only made everything so much worse. This lasted for several weeks, during which I legitimately thought I had broken my body and would suffer forever. During one of those sleepless nights, I got out of bed and filled out an application to become a medical marijuana patient, citing muscle spasms as my ailment, and several weeks later (too late!) I had my card. The only thing that helped to any noticeable degree as I was going through this was large doses of loperamide, which did not by any means make my suffering entirely tolerable. I still have those stupid blue capsules in my desk drawer. 

Anyway, I wasn't going anywhere with this story. I'm back in school, back at a part-time job, not using any drugs regularly other than alcohol, and this story came to mind while I was (and still am) putting off some online homework. I'd love to use heroin again, but I know what a truly awful idea that is for me. Thanks for reading. ",1505963588.0

I am currently on subutex (stupid decision) as I don't think I needed it as I had one or two 2-3 day binges a month and didn't want to withdraw. Anyways I jave degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis, and joint hypertrophy with the MRI report to back it up. I have a legit need, but as a 28 year old male on subutex, I was hoping for some advice to get back on something that actually helps with pain. Karma is a bitch.

Additionally, is there something I can do online with my MRI report to make this process easier? Maybe some more liberal doctors online?

Thanks guys.

*Update* Well, that day is here. My guy has been out pretty much since I posted this and I have been **dragging ASS**. Lope helps, but only so far. It's this kind of WD's that make you start thinking about doing stupid shit.

Deals with the Devil (or something) 



All pins and needles


Engulfed in flame


She's speaking in riddles


She calls out my name


The lady of dreams


Brother of warmth


Manyfaced fiend


Chained to its hearth


I'll feed you my soul


Wrench out my heart


Cook till I boil


Let you rip me apart


I'll change you my blood 


For your healing touch 


Make you my God 


In exchange for a rush 


Tie what was broken 


With what's built anew 


Through an exchange of tokens


Some blood for dark brew  



(if there's something off language wise, English isn't my first language [which is why I'm into puns & so bad at it]. I had the idea for the rhyme whilst registering and plunging down the aforementioned brew into my bloodstream, if that helps making sense of it. No excuse for the drama tho.)

That was a gut punch. My mom was adopted, and you DONT TREAT ADOPTED KIDS OR OTHERWISE THAT WAY.

Also, my Grandma was my rock, I mean weekly phone calls for YEARS. I told her everything, vice versa. Until my mom played me the voicemail.

I'm FIERCELY loyal to my mother. She's put up my with my addiction, being homeless, going to jail, there's nothing I can do to push her away. So I took my moms ""side"" and never spoke to my grandma (or grandpa, because he never once apologized for her) ever again.

It made me really said over the years, and they both recently passed between July - Sept. It was a shock.

They had a large estate, and my mom, and my brothers all assumed we were taken out of the will.

Well, good news and bad news. Y'all were right, he moved on from pills to banging heroin. And he'd OD'ed and ended up in the hospital. Also found out he'd been injecting the pills for a whole before that - I thought he was just snorting & parachuting them. Either he or the hospital told his shrink about it, and he ended up in rehab, which was why I hadn't heard from him. 

The semi-good news as that he decided on his own to go into longer-term treatment, because he knows he's gotten way past what he can handle. I heard from him once, between the two, because he wanted to let me know he was OK and what he was doing, and once since he's been there because phone calls were limited and I asked him to talk to his mom first and she's let me know he's alright (they used to be super-close and both want to fix their relationship, but it's been hurt pretty badly over the last few years).

I told him I'll be fine, just to focus on himself, and we'll revisit things when he gets out. He knows I love him, but that just going back to being friends and letting him focus on him getting his life straight and then worrying about the relationship stuff later is an option as well. For now, I'm busy working on my own shit with school and probably changing jobs soon, and going to Al-Anon (no NarAnon nearby and a lot of this started with drinking) and generally working on my own shit (codependency and all the crap that brings, combined with my own mental issues).

More than once I've been told I'm a worthless bottom feeder because of addiction, but, you know, I've found addicts to be some of the most empathetic, caring people I've ever met. I try to be kind to people I meet, too. 

Just because we use drugs, doesn't mean we're worthless. We are all human beings and we all deserve life, peace and light. Yes, some people are harder than others, but I would say on the whole, most addicts I know are decent people who are in the fucking shit. And that tends to make people more compassionate.

Maybe if our society had more enlightened education, laws, and resources addiction wouldn't be as much of a problem. But this world is fundamentally broken. People grow up being hit, raped, yelled at, sold off, shamed, and then we wonder why substance abuse and mental illness and crime are so prevalent.

I'm trying to make these 8 months as painless as possible so I didn't say anything, but the fucker walked on my carpet with his shoes on. I live in a dope ass condo which is clearly better than whatever shit hole he lives in, as he couldn't believe this was actually my house and kept asking me over and over again whether I own the place. Yes motherfucker I do, it's called balling. He was especially angered by the fact I've only been outta prison for 5 months but I already have my shit together.

mouth to mouth which was actually working, he took a breath or 2 after the mouth to mouth. His face was turning really pale. His heart was slowing down rapidly, my friend was pumping and hitting his chest in which i honestly believe kept his heart going. So I grabbed his keys and asked them to call 911 while I left (I dont have a license but I know how to drive) and drove like a maniac but safe as well and called up my homie who has a lot of narcan and luckily was awake and answered. We drove back (total time now being about 10 minutes since him not responding ) when i got back my idiot friend did not call 911 due to him having warrants. We used the nasal spray narcan, waited a minute and no luck. Then we hit him in the leg from the vial of narcan he also brought and he slowly started coming back!!!!!!! He finally opened his eyes and slurred his words it was actually more like mumbling, But after about 3 minutes he was able to stand up and go lay down on the couch. 

I guess I'm just venting here. I didnt wanna go home and be alone so I went to my other friends house(the one with the narcan) just to be with someone because I still feel scared, traumatized almost. 

I have so much adrenaline going through me I've never panicked or been so scared of anything this bad before. I have xanax i wanted to take so bad but I was also in minor withdrawls so i decided to just shoot some H and it kinda calmed me down a bit but I'm still in shock. 

For anyone else whose experienced this in their life, how bad did this effect you? 



P.s. there was some random dude there (some homeboy) which i believe stole me friends phone while he was OD'ing and also broke into his car and took his iPod unless someone else happened to break in which is extremely coincidental.

However the monster still rides on me... As much as I'm not a stimulant guy, cocaine smoked or shot has me by the balls pretty good...

I'm working now and taking classes, giving my mom most of my paycheck as per agreement and my debts, but once a week when I have money in my pockets, and the dealer will drive to me, I find it hard not to fall to temptation. Thank God the dope girl doesn't sell H too because my problem would be more than twice as bad...but man crack is bad enough, scares me what it does to my heart, and how it hijacks my brain...

Today I paid my ma 200 out of my 300+ check..., paid my bro the 20 I owed and my sis the 10....got 60 of hard delivered....

Smoked it up and called her to bring another 30 worth...she dawdled and I was supposed to meet her at a location, got there and didn't see her, don't have a phone so I asked someone to borrow one. Of course as has happened before, it was probably all over my face and chick asked what I was tryin to do, I told her and she was like ""shit I got a guy with fat bags of fire around the corner""...

My dealer shorts me and runs me around so I figured ""fuck it"" (shithead move), and went for it. Got a nice blast and got geeked out, fronted a 20 with her and went back home to ask my ma for the cash to cover what I owed and get another blast.

My ma, God bless her, is just fucking done with my shenanigans, even if I am slowly improving overall over time. Something like this sends me back to square 0...

So I get home and explain the situation, and my ma ain't having it. She's freaking the fuck out, and intending to go along for the ride back to pay this dude off and drop this chick I met off...

So we get to the area, and dammit I owed 20 (plus 20 for the front supposed to be payed tomorrow), told ma I owed 50. So she gives the chick 50, and I step out fixing to follow her to make sure she pays dude off and for us to split the last 10. This is besides the fact she took advantage and asked my ma for 10 more bucks to get cigarettes. 

So I tell her I just want my one last hit, I'll take it home whatever, and she starts raising a ruckus. She was sucking up to my ma on the ride over and tried saying ""I ain't even getting any more to smoke and I ain't gonna do that to your ma""....like bitch I said I owed 50 when it was really only 40 and truly only 20, and you also weaseled 10 bucks out of her for smokes, and bitch you not gonna let me go pay your boy off and get my last hit?

It was fucked up, and I feel like a big grimy scumbag, and I am. But Goddammit, if I didn't get fucked here and feeling pretty sour about it...

All I know is I can't keep doing this shit, especially to my poor mom. I want to pretend this was a bad dream. It felt so good giving her the 200 out of my check and only spending 60 on hard at first, but then I had to go off on an adventure and fuck it all up. I just want to cry but I feel emotionally dead inside. The worst part is I know I need to man up, but that monster is still on my back and next week I know I'll be placing a call to get some shit delivered...

A few weeks back a friend and I started alternating on our off weeks. I'd get paid, buy stuff for him and I, split it down the middle and then he'd pay me back next chance he had with goods in kind. I remember one of those times I had to work through the weekend, and I had my next to last dose before work on a Friday and he was texting me about how shitty he felt and asked if I ""could spare a bump."" Others agreed over here that since he didn't have work that he could suck it up. So I was good that Friday and then that Saturday I felt like shit as the remaining bump only held me for a short period.

That's why I prefer to secure some subs before getting dope. 

&nbsp;

My friend is a bit of a mooch but he's been even with the dope related stuff more or less because he doesn't want to jeopardize his ability to get dope on a non-pay week. So like two days ago I get four buns, two for each of us and two subs, one for each of us. Days earlier I also gave him money for subs, but as expected if he didn't get subs that money would go towards something else, namely food. Sometimes his mom nags him into oblivion to order breakfast. Well, he didn't initially admit that.

The story of copping subs earlier this week went like this. He said that he gave CJ the middle money for the subs. After two days of delays he texted me that CJ had them but would deliver them in the morning. Then when CJ showed up in the AM, he claimed that he simply returned the cash because he couldn't' get subs and that there was a miscommunication. So logically, I'm thinking on pay day, why am I only getting two subs? Didn't I give him enough money earlier in the week to get two more fucking subs?

I wasn't gonna press him for answers on this but I decided just to ask because fuck it and as expected he admitted that he spent it on food. He also said, ""I wish I saved it for today to get more subs."" Sure he did, he probably never ordered the subs earlier in the week.

&nbsp;

Whatever, at least we got the other subs we ordered yesterday. I plan to cut mine up into pretty tiny pieces. I also plan to keep them to myself if he asks for any after he runs out. 

I get to his house last night and he tells me even before I arrived that he had a helluva night due to a couple of events that I couldn't guess. First a story, he tells me that there was a less than reputable character outside with his sibling while he was walking his dog and that him and his sibling got into a verbal altercation because they were talking smack about how he never walks the dog, which is pretty true. 

While my friend was outside, he claims that he dropped three bags of h,  which were part of a ten bag bun. Of course, idk if his story was true or not but the presence of a less than reputable characters supports the premise of why such bags on the ground would disappear. 

&nbsp;

Regardless, I am then presented with the age old question. **""Do you want to hear the good news of the bad news first?""** Since he dropped three bags he indicated he would ask me for some, I immediately snap, like a fucking frustrated person who's already given more than I should have to. At this time I I'm lucky to still have enough money for a haircut and incidentals. I spent damn near all my money to get the dope for borth of us so when he asked for shit from my stash my first statement is basically that, ""I spent nearly all my money, I just wanted to be able to enjoy that which I've spent my [hard earned] money on and enjoy getting faded before it runs out."" 

**He asks for just two bags.** Fine, you know what, I can live with that. He's given me free bags before and I had ten left. He also gave me the good news about his unexpected payout this week but I don't count on good news from this friend. Sometimes you get told shit you want to hear, whatever you need to hear in order to say yes to a request.

&nbsp;


So now, here's where **the subject of human nature comes into the story.** While I was bugging out about having to give up some of my limited supply, he mentions that when he got paid last week that he did buy me ""three and a half buns last week"".  Absolutely not, maybe two and a half and even that's subject to argument. I know he definitely bought me two buns after he got paid last week. The reason is because I distinctly remember his share was greater at three buns. Three for him, two for me. I remembered that because it's certainly wasn't 50/50 share as it is when I'm buying. That's fine, because I didn't want to be indebted to him for that much anyway. As for the extra half bun, I put $50 towards that and two subs. Technically he covered the exta $5 cost of the h.

&nbsp;

I remember we were discussing the plans for his pay day, and I was expressing my desire to get subs in lieu of extra dope because I knew I wouldn't beable to pay him back the following week if he bought me too much dope for me. 

He was like, ""it ain't like that."" Acting as though I wouldn't have to get him back with what he bought me once I had the means to do so. Of course it's like that! And if I had any doubts it wasn't like that, it became like that when he mentioned having bought me 3.5 buns last week as opposed to 2.5. I don't want to keep paper records due to legalities, but maybe I should have done so for the sake of certainty.

&nbsp;

The point is, human nature is to remember what others owe you when you're in need and to even amplify the amount as is convenient for one self.

My memory of it is vague, but I've been searching for it so much and can't find it! I was hoping maybe someone here remembers it.

Basically the story starts out with him wanting to try heroin. He tries and and thinks it is alright, but isn't really a fan. He slowly uses it more and more often. He talks about using a little bit of heroin before reading. Or a little bit of heroin before doing this and that.

Eventually the story ends where he goes on vacation with his wife and runs out of heroin. He starts going through withdrawals. He ends up ordering some and having it sent to the hotel he was staying at. He realizes that he is now addicted and mentions that he was even about to get some needles and IV it. That's where the story ends and he says he quit. 

Does anyone remember this? I hope I gave enough information. I've been searching for it the whole past our. It was either posted here or on /r/drugs. Thank you!",1506046870.0

We have the power. Let's use it. 

From now on, refer to syringes as **PICKLES** and nothing else.

Example:

""Hey Donny, you got any fresh pickles? Mines got a bent tip.""

""Sorry bro, I'm all out. Let's just share my pickle, I've only been using it a few weeks. I'll bleach it after I'm done, that kills all the hepatitis.""

""Donny! Your pickle is way too worn and bleach doesn't make a used pickle safe! I'll just cut the tip off my pickle and stick it up my arsehole.""

""Hell yes, bro! Boofing is so fetch right now!""

If every single user on this sub got his friends and acquaintances to start using ""pickle"" instead of rig, and then those friends spread it even further....one day junkies all across the world will be shooting up with pickles!

And it all started here, at /r/opiates. 

(I guess it doesn't have to be pickles, although I'm a big fan of pickles in general.)

It's just the first step, too. One day we will unite all opiate users and go on an international heroin strike to end the sale of fentanyl laced dope! Or just rename BTH ""poop"" or something like that.

I didn't think I would have to be doing this just one night after my first go with an opiate, but damn, guess you really can underestimate this shit.

Long story short, I've been having some real bad sore throats recently, and no medications I took seemed to have any helpful effect. Yesterday evening I decided I would give Nurofen Plus a go (which contains codeine and ibuprofen, for those who may be unaware), and because I am someone who very much so enjoys being high, ended up taking a recreational dose. I did perform a CWE, however later on throughout the night, after already consuming the drugs, learnt that I had in fact screwed up said extraction and ingested what was a possible 1600mg of ibuprofen, as well as the desired 100mg of codeine. 

Because that amount of ibuprofen is nowhere near a lethal dose, I got over worrying quickly and, quite frankly, was completely smitten and fascinated by the high I had just experienced. Unable to control myself, I attempted the same dose tonight, this time correctly performing the CWE. Despite this, for whatever reason, I soon figured that I was barely experiencing any effects, which prompted me to take two more pills (spaced out over time), no CWE. This again produced barely noticeable effects, at least not enjoyable ones. Just when the most recent dose's effects were supposed to be felt, I began experiencing an awful racing heart, discomfort and pressure in my head/neck, and extreme anxiety. It seriously felt like I was dying. It came on gradually, lasted thirty minutes to an hour (I realise that isn't a very long time, but coupled with the lack of recreational effects, I feel this is very strange), and left what seemed to be very abruptly.

I apologise if this ended up being possibly too long, but I would seriously appreciate someone who's more experienced with opiates input on this. Much thanks.

I mentioned it before, but I made the switch from oxy to H, because my tolerance was so high it would take 240mg of oxy for me to even nod. That is way too expensive for pills. But when I made the switch to H, I was unimpressed and unable to nod while smoking tar in the beginning. As I got better at smoking and honed my technique, I was able to nod from smoking, but I still found myself having to smoke a lot of H. In addition, with opiates, you have to get the dose of opiate goodness into your system as fast as possible. Unlike other drugs, there is a timer that starts as soon as you start dosing, and the faster you deliver the opiates to the brain the better. 

I made some monkey water, laid down, and used an oral syringe to drop the solution into my nose, but I still found that this took a long time, and due to my tolerance, I had to deliver a good amount of monkey water into my nose. It was damn near impossible to prevent a good amount of it from being wasted by dripping into the back of my throat. I want to point out I used no more than 3mL of water when doing this. I made sure I saturated the solution the best I could.

I knew what boofing was, but it just seemed so taboo to me. Putting drugs up my ass just seemed weird and disgraceful. But finally, I decided to give it a try, and I must say, it worked like a charm.

day before that i snorted .5m halcion

and the day before that 30mg of valium

Will it be safe for me to use the one 30mg oxycodone pill I found? I don't have much tolerance (last time I did oxy was 4 months ago at 35-40mg for the high) and I don't know how much of those benzo's I found will be left. I intend to potentiate the oxy with grapefruit and tagemat, dxm & dph.

Nodded out on the toilet the entire night and woke up to a phone call from p.o. telling me I need to come in for a drug test. I lied to him and said I couldn't get there, he was not happy and told me to come at 8am this morning, I texted at 8 saying I was working on a ride when in reality I was trying to decide if I should wear extra socks to the appointment.

Bout 11 he texts me ""you want me to recommend jail or prison on your violation report?"" so I got my ass on the bus and went to see him.. Dropped piss less than 30 hours off a nod expecting to melt the fuckin cup. But nope, that shit was clean. Yay for fent!

I posted a pic of my first cop ever last night. I'm curious about dosing and just experience in general so here goes. 

I've never gotten high with needles and I would prefer to keep it that way. I know the oral BA of morphine is much lower than any other 20-40%, but this really doesn't oppose me to this ROA. Seriously. I'm ready to make some nasty ass morphine lean hahahahaha jk

Me: 

Rec user of hydro/oxy that gets high sub 100mg level forsure. Usually 40mg or so of hydro would be a nice high in the most recent experiences. Never have gone above like 70mg in a whole day

How can I best use my 200 mg of morphine? I'm also open to plugging it, I just want to dose it out reasonably. I will likely be using it very spaced out. I'm not looking to get floored back to back to back.

So now the 3 go to spots I had in my arms are sore not really bruised and maybe a tad swollen but not to the point it seems like a miss or abscess is coming. But the shootups leading to this everything felt good and right just afterwards, my arms seemed fucked. So I go again and now I've tried 2/3 spots and I didn't feel anything. Registered and was all fine but blastoff had me feel nothing but sore there and still sick. And it's the same shit so I know it's good. 

All I can guess is I collapsed those veins and i just shot into a dead vein. I could be wrong idk. Cause I can register those veins below the sore spot, like anywhere from my hand to the sore spot. Above the sore spot I can't (but I never could hit past my elbow anyways) so it could be cause it's collapsed there or cause I just can't hit anyways. 
So now I'm wondering wtf to do, I haven't tried my hands yet but that's be my next option I'm just wondering if that'll be a waste too cause it leads to the same vein that's possibly collapsed by inner elbow. Idk if this even makes sense I don't know much about anatomy and veins, I'm just guessing by putting two and two together.

I heard somewhere that cutting up the pill in two, crushing one half then setting the powder out into five lines before snorting one of them would do it, however I'd like a little more insight before going with such a method.

...and no one ordered them yet

Came to hospital because of a recurrent infection in my leg (not opiate related), and I had drawn blood cultures a couple days ago that grew MSSA, so the infection is systemic at this point. Just needed the MD to order IV antibiotics and send the order to my infusion company for me to do. The whole deal should have taken a couple of hours. Got to the ER at 10pm Friday and expected it to be somewhat busy because of the time. Wrong. Not a soul in the waiting room, I was seen by a doctor within 5 minutes, who decided to re-draw the cultures and some other basic labs. I have a central line but they don't want to use it because it is being finicky and it isn't ""their"" line. I informed them I have horrible veins. That's when the ""fun"" started. Even though I saw my surgeon, had an i&d done to drain the infection, had an X-ray and ultrasound done all within the first hour of arriving, it took four doctors and 4.5 hours to get an IV in. They convinced me to stay until today since it was already like 3am and they wanted to run one dose of antibiotics. So I agreed since it was only going to be a few hours. Didn't bother saying anything about pain medicine. 
So, they moved me up to the floor and handed me my ""care plan"" which has the medications they ordered listed on it... and there are NO antibiotics ordered, which is the whole reason I'm here... but they did order my fentanyl, dilaudid, ativan, etc without being asked at all (not complaining! It's just weird). And it's the weekend so the MD up here on the floor won't do rounds for awhile yet. Such a waste of time. I want to go home, why can't people just do what they're supposed to!?

On the other hand, this is an example of the controlled substance database coming in handy. They checked that, saw what I'm on despite this not being my normal hospital so not having it on my chart, and ordered it for me without ever even having to discuss my use of controlled substances. Certainly can't complain about that part.

TL;DR: The ER was empty, could have been home within an hour if they hadnt decided to draw labs and refused to use my line but instead I'm still here and the required meds still aren't ordered.",1506172960.0

  I started doing opiates ate the age of 14.. Buddy of mine the grade above me, his mother was a nurse at a nearby hospital, and she somehow managed to amass a fucking huge stash of Watson 357's. Greens, and back then that shit was like heroin to me. I took six pills every morning with him, and within a couple of months he was busted and I was left to my first withdrawal experience.
  Now this only lasted a few weeks and was not as near a severe as the withdrawals I have on and off endured for the last few years... But it left me knowing the power of opiates.. at least a little bit. I managed to stay away from opiates mostly for the next three or four years. Then I had my first oxy.. purple 20's.. later to become blue 30's. That was it for me, in my mind I had found the answer to my problems, for my depression, for my anxiety. It seemed a miracle, though I knew there would be consequences from daily use so I tried to tune it down to three days a week. I felt if I could have that peace at least some of the time it was worth not ever having it. Eventually found a dillaudid connect the next town over, and even got some black tar off of the darkweb a few months later.
  Injection had me from the start, from the moment that first plunger was pressed down, I was hooked. I felt invincible, and for a time was able to afford it.. somewhat. It eventually led me to a methadone clinic where I did pretty well for about  a year, but for the next four years the clinic was just a means to an end, and they obviously had no intentions of helping me get off. Fast forward to now, kicked out of the clinic, can no longer afford the price of buying heroin 2-3 times a week, including the 6 hour round trip to even fucking cop. Yeah I said it, 6 fucking hours. There is no heroin in my town, and that I can assure you... It is very rural and rampant with meth addiction, and like most of America, has a very bad hydrocodone problem. But there is no heroin, and if there was it would possibly be deadly, and probably worthless garbage. 
  I was able to get a script for suboxone not long ago, but for a soild week very small success with it. Now here comes in kratom... For the first time since I started the subs, I feel better. Not amazingly perfect, but I am able to focus, type this, and my legs aren't flailing and spazzing out. I honestly feel like kratom may be the answer, but I don't even know where to start. 

The Kratom I have is from phytoextractem, ultra enhanced indo, and a I-Sol 8 extract which I am confused on what it contains. I also have some standard Bali from a company called Edens Ethnos? And a cheap bag of headshop maeng da.

So far relief has only came from the ultra enhanced indo, and a small amount of the I-sol 8 extract, though I have not tried it very much at all. I want to quit this life, and this sub was always a welcome place for me where I felt at home. I believe I have seen some kratom success stories here a few different times, and I would love to hear your advice, certainly from people switching from H to Kratom. My life has been torn apart by opiates, and for the longest time it felt as if there was no answer. I finally feel like there may be hope. But cravings for the fucking sickly sweet mix of heroin and coke in the syringe are strong, and I fear I may give in before I can make this work.. I am sorry for the long ass post but I had no where else to turn and I hope to hear many of your opinions",1506144149.0

I'm about to vent - This has got me fucked up...

It started at 4pm, I was a little late because I had to go pick a buddy up to come with. When I got there I walked through the doors with the collage of pictures I made (I linked it so you guys could see) saw the casket and just lost it. I sat in the side room just crying. A few buddies showed up - tried to comfort me but I just wanted to be left alone. I was upset because a couple people showed up REALLY fucked up, but i tried to remember how I felt when I was using. I smoked a couple cigarettes and tried to gain my composure. 

It was 8pm and people were leaving. I still had not gone to see her yet. Her mom tried to drag me up there but I just cried like a fucking baby. Around 8:15 I took a deep breath and walked towards her. My body felt tingly and I could barely breath. I stopped about 10 feet away from her... I could see her laying there... I was shaking - trying to talk myself through this. I walk to her - It didn't even look like her... they put something in her cheeks to make her face look fuller - I could see all the bruises on her hands from missing. I completely lost it, i fucking fell to the floor saying 'no no no' over and over. I couldn't get up - I couldn't move - this was the worst night (right next to Willie's death) ever. 

I finally got up - I had these little dinosaurs we had gotten earlier this summer - you know, the little tiny plastic ones. We got all herbivores so they could be friends. I put them by her hands (kept one for myself), I kind of brushed against her arm... It was so stiff. I just wanted her to wake up... 

I had to go now - the family wanted time alone with her. I really couldn't move - it felt like a movie... As I walked out I saw this candle with her picture on it... I grabbed it and shoved it in my purse.

The funeral home is in the heart of where we used to cop. I drove to one of the spots and sat there for about an hour... watching deals, holding the candle, thinking about death... I wanted to cop so fucking bad - Yea, yea, I know - she would want me to stay clean blah blah blah... I'm so sick of hearing this bullshit. If she wanted me to stay clean then she should have too... 

I am just straight broken right now. ",1506138828.0

Half of y’all (more than that I’m sure) probably have no idea who I even am. I’ve been clean for about 7 months now. I’m still dating the same guy from all my previous post. He was clean all the way until about two months ago. Ever since then he’s been using. I’ve been tolerating it because I love him. First it was “you can’t use in front of me or be around me when you’re high”. Then it was “you can be around me when you’re high but don’t do it in front of me” then  “you can do it in my house but I’m going in the other room” & now we are at the point where I’m letting him mix up shots in front of me and help him shoot up. Pretty sure the only reason I haven’t relapsed yet is because I’m out on bond facing a lot of time. I don’t have many people in my life and my family are all users so they can’t hit me with the truth like I need. Can somebody please remind me that if I continue to stay around him that more than likely I will fucking relapse? Or at least remind me that I’m a fucking idiot. The harder you guys are with me the more it’ll get through my thick ass skull. I’ve tried the whole “if you don’t stop using I’m leaving” route. Of course we all know that doesn’t work. I love him but I need to do what’s best for myself it’s just easier said than done. 

TLDR: I’m in recovery, boyfriend started using again, need someone to tell me to tighten the fuck up before it’s me with the needle in my arm again. ",1506136997.0

(long ranting shitpost; i am extremely upset & having a terrible day, i just need to get it all out, guys.. sorry) 😭","as soon as something goes missing, or something goes wrong, you're the first fucking person everyone suspects is at fault. it is seriously gut-wrenching when you're the only one that everyone around you is willing to blame. someone steals something, and it MUST have been the fucking drug addict, right?...  (yes i realize that sometimes that is the case; but i DIDN'T fucking do this, guys... i may be a dopehead but i have never been a thief)

the people close to me don't really know that i'm (sorta) chipping, they think i'm clean. which makes this even more frustrating because they are still treating me like i'm the only potential person to blame. like am i seriously that terrible of a person that even when i'm ""clean"" im the only one that is likely to fuck someone over and steal some money? i am a genuinely good person in my opinion. i am an empath and i practice energy healing... like i care deeply about everyone around me. this is not something i would do. 

fuck this. i am being blamed for something i did not fucking do and it's literally breaking my heart. the reason being that the person who is blaming me is my significant other... 

i guarantee whoever did do it, did so knowing that they will get away with it because who is the first person everyone suspects when something goes missing? the junkie. whether you're using or clean, there are some things that come as a result of having an addiction that just seemingly never really go away... 

guys i am so fucking sad right now. i am basically being pushed to the point of verbal abuse (honestly pretty fucking common at this point in my relationship, anyway...) just so that i will pack my shit and get out of my mans house. i have already been welcomed back into my room at my mom's with open arms tbh, as she knows about his verbally abusive behavior towards me. it just fucking sucks, guys. i love him to death and yes we have our faults... but we've been together for about 6 years and when the good times are good, they're fucking great. 

we've taken a couple breaks in the past, but every time we just wind up missing each other and getting back together. it starts off great, and then fades back into the small issues again... i am so sad. we just got two perfect kittens and they're technically his and his child's, so i have to leave them here. i have my fur baby at home thankfully...

but i guess i just kinda have to get out of here and go home to my moms. my room is still my room there, anyway... i've just been living here for a few months and i am about to pack up all my shit. i can't handle constantly being treated like a terrible person. constantly being told i am lazy. constantly being picked apart for my faults... constantly being reminded of everything i've done wrong in the past. the way my man speaks to me, you'd think he believes he's a saint. ha, he's not. i guess i have to get the fuck out of here for myself...

Ended up asking me if I smoked than if I did xanax at first I was drawn back but asked if he could get blues. He said he could just gotta give him a little so I took his number and said I'd hit him up . I did few hours later because I've been Jonesin. So he came through took me to his dealer I waited outside he came back with three blues all real and I got fucking catted cause it's been like two months. Anyway I hit him up again today and after hours of waiting I get the call to come meet him at a plaza this time I asked for six blues. Gave him the money he said he would be right back....been two hours been calling and texting him non stop with no avail. Got fucked today big time and I know it's clearly my fault never should have trusted some asshole I met at a gas station but I thought he would do me right since he hooked me up before.

Okay, so Ive been using opioids and heroin on and off for ten years. The other day I missed a vein on the top of my hand and had something happen that never has before. 

So to be specific, I missed two days ago and instantly my hand swole up like a fat ol sausage. Since then my hand has become increasingly more painful and stiff. I can no longer make a fist and doing anything with this hand is quite painful. It's radiating a little bit of head and my forearm is starting to feel a bit sore too and it's all just worrying me. I've had my share of abscesses and from that my hygiene when it comes to shooting is about as clean as one can really make shooting dope. 

It doesn't feel like an abscess. There is no central point the pain is coming from either so I don't think it's an infection. Is it?

Does anyone have any advice for me? I'm not scared to go to the hospital to get help if I truly need It. It's just very expensive for me (LOL LIKE DOPE ISNT). I'm already tagged as a junky so it's not gonna be a shock to them. Or me. 

So anyone have something similar happen? Did you die? Thanks in advance. 

PS. I usually hate when people post stupid questions like this asking for shitty advice from strangers on the internet, but here I am..

Im taking 25mg of oxycodone (highest dose ever, im experiences with opiates but my sensitivity has kept me away from high doses, and its a on and aff habit so ive never built up a substancial tolerance) ill be using tums, benadryl, white grapefruit juice, and maybe xanax to put me to sleep at the end of the night because i will be taking amphetamine beforehand.

I went to google something along the lines of ""generic subs not working"" and it auto-filled my search result in the bar. my only guess is that it dissolves so quickly in your mouth and gets swallowed that it doesn't have time to absorb sublingually, cuz when I snort them they work just fine 1 mg and under.

Kinda dissapointed.,"Did some H for the first time yesterday. I think it was #3 and came in the shape of small brown rocks. I normally would never buy heroin but i still had some clonazepam, zopiclone and tramadol in me which probably mediated my actions.

I snorted maybe 80 mg, making sure nothing dripped down my throat. After about 10 min I felt it and I felt it HARD! The benzos still in my blood probably potentiated it.

As soon as I sat down I began to nod. Acting some what sober was impossible, and the benzos still in my blood didn't make it any better. 

I spent the entire high out in public and of course people would stare at me haha.

I went to bed and woke up in the middle of the night and decided to snort some more. This happened twice during the night. And both times I just nodded in and out a few times then just fell asleep. 

I'm honestly quite dissapointed. I've done fentanyl, tramadol and kratom before and based on this experience all those 3 substances yielded nicer highs.

The H seemed to give me basically no euphoria which made me think that I might had gotten fent but the high lasted much much longer than fent and I'm not sure if fent laced dope is common in the country I live in.",1506262914.0

BUT, my night didn't end there. we were all nodding in and out, and after a while one of my friends said he wanted mac n cheese, and everyone else thought it sounded good too, so i volunteered to make it. we all went inside and they watched me make it, and when it was done everyone except me ate, because i can't eat on opiates. after they ate, two of them fell asleep, and it was just me and one other friend left. 

Things get a little silly after the other two fell asleep, because i'm a big romantic sentimental baby, and i say and do really dumb stuff sometimes. So, me and the remaining friend went out to the balcony to smoke another cigarette and talk. while we were talking, i decided that i wanted to kiss someone while i was on heroin for the first time. To me, heroin felt like pure love, and being the lonely girl that i was, i wanted to see how far i could push that feeling, so, when the conversation began to wind down, i told him my idea, and asked if i could kiss him. he agreed, and said he only had one request: he wanted to cuddle first. i said sure and tried to act nonchalant about it, but i was screaming on the inside. i was absolutely elated. so, we went inside, crawled into bed, and cuddled for the next four hours. he was warm and soft and i had never felt anything as comfortable as his arms around me. being the unexperienced, hopeless romantic that i was back then, cuddling with a boy like him would have already been heavenly, even if i was sober. heroin amplified those feelings of love and pleasure and comfort to an intensity that i didn't know was possible, and to this day it is still the most intensely i've ever felt any emotion. regardless of how much i try, i will never be able to put into words how pure and heavenly the euphoria i felt was. 

doing heroin was delightful on its own, but cuddling with my friend turned the experience from being just a really good high into the purest and most memorable experience of my life, and to this day i have still never felt anything as intense as the love i felt that night. 

afterwards, i never really wanted heroin again. i knew no matter how much heroin i did, a plain drug-induced bliss could never come close to being as intense as that night, and i still genuinely believe that. in a way i'm kind of sad, because opiates definitely lost their magic for me after that night, but i'm also happy, because knowing nothing will ever feel as magical as that first time euphoria combined with pure love, and it has kept me from trying it again, just so i can avoid the disappointment. 

sorry if this is long and poorly written, i've been up all night thinking and i decided that i'm going sober for the next few months to focus on school. if i had continued using heroin and become addicted, sobriety wouldn't be an easy decision or goal, and i'm finally realizing just how lucky and truly blessed i am to have had an experience like that to keep me from falling down the rabbit hole ",1506254927.0

What do you call a guy who sells you subs? Answer: Subhuman. ::badump::

Actually, he's a pretty good guy. 

&nbsp;

Moving right along.... I've been trying to formulate a short post but I keep setting it aside because it grows too long and I understand that this is a community, not my personal blogging platform. 

Let's make up some names here. First we have my friend Cliff. Cliff is someone I've written about before as my friend and sometimes running partner. Then we have Zio. Zio is an okay dude, sometimes talks a lot, often to talk about his ""time on the streets"" and ""being of the street"" but not at all a bad hearted human being. He has always treated me with respect and comes in peace.

&nbsp; 

Yesterday I visited Cliff after work and he told me how Zio was blowing up his phone, even came to his door and was trying to track him down numerous ways over a debt incurred receiving a bun last week. Cliff alleges that he told Zio that he had no money and that he wouldn't be able to pay him back for a week to a week and a half. It is alleged that Zio was cool with these terms. 

So why is Zio bugging him so much when it has only been a week? Cliff should have another half week. I guess cliff must've heard ""a week"" and not the wider part of the estimated date range. I was willing to buy this story. Cliff also accurately stated that he has no OC15s or footballs yet Zio keeps asking for those if he doesn't have cash. This is one thing I am certain of.

&nbsp;

I spoke to Zio on the phone and briefly assured him that Cliff does not have any OCs or footballs. Then later that evening Zio informed me that he has a couple of subs on hand if I wanna stock up. Well shit, I've been meaning to skip my middle which is my friend Cliff. Cliff is and has been virtually the only person that I've ever purchased or gotten opiates through or from. 

Even better, Zio was willing to see me right now. So I jump on my mighty stead and I make my way over in record time. Zio comes out, we swap paper for film and then we have a talk. 

&nbsp;

The way Zio recants events really does add credibility to his side of the story. He explained that about a week ago Cliff took the bun on the arm and assured him that he'd be getting paid on a specific day. The type of statement he got, ""I get paid at 3AM on x-day.""

Zio told me that when he contacted Cliff on his alleged pay day, Cliff said ""I gotta take my mom to the bank in a cab."" That and possibly other bullshit story excuses that made it impossible for him to fulfill his debt obligation that day. The following day, when Zio wanted to come through or was already by Cliff's house, Cliff said ""nah, I'm down three blocks over behind the green gate, in one of the hobbit houses."" (obv we don't have hobbit houses, they're hobbit holes but I'm trying to maintain geographic anonymity) I thought these bullshit stories were funny because they were very familiar to me.

&nbsp; 

**Why I found the current run-around tale from Zio about Cliff to be funny.**

Four years ago Cliff told me he'd get me a $300 ounce of weed from his pill connect for $200. On one of the days following, I sat on his front step before work figuring I can wait for him or that he'd come out. When I texted him he indicated it would be pointless for me to wait on his stoop. He literally said *""I'm not home, I have to take my mom to the bank then go to the supermarket.""*

I know I shouldn't talk ill of my friends, but Cliff was and really is a lazy fat fuck. It was very uncharacteristic of him to dutifully do shit for his mom at that time on that particular day. 

Point is, I just love that he used the *""I'm dutifully doing shit for my mom""* excuse again, years later on our friend Zio. This clear memory of mine is what gave credibility to Zio's accounting of events.

&nbsp;

Problem with Zio's perspective is that he can't remember specific days. Although Cliff is increasingly becoming suspect, he at least gives specific days when accounting events. Zio just won't do it.... he honestly can't remember because he loves 'em stix. He just knows that the guy he owes money to is pissed and claims he will toss a brick through Cliff's window if he doesn't pay up soon. He also says that the person who throws the brick will do it again in the winter to make a point. Dayum. 

&nbsp;

____________________________________________________________

&nbsp;

Well, to this point, **all I've done is tell yet another junkie story.** I wanted to share with the community that I want to try to get clean. I'm sick of the cycle. Especially the arrangement I have as of the past month. My friend Cliff and I take turns buying dope since we each get paid in the middle of each other's pay cycle. The first two times I bought the stuff, I kept running out of money and left with **the terrible sense of defeat that comes from spending all of your money two days into a two week pay cycle.** The third and last time I was buying dope I took measures to make sure I had enough money left over for important non-dope related incidentals. Bought a tire for my bike and got my hair cut so now I look sexy. Just gotta get back on my pumping iron regiment and it'll be like the glory days of the Roman empire.

Anyway, despite spending virtually all of my money on dope, it doesn't last me a week. It might last me longer if I was only buying the dope for myself but if I only go through the one point of contact this is the inevitable outcome. I guess I could just start using the new connects I just accumulated and cut out my middle man who goes to other middles to get. I have to deal with a double, sometimes triple middle. Technically, not anymore. However, it would probably be altogether easier and in my overall best interests to quit altogether. 

&nbsp;

So regarding my fat lazy friend Cliff, he got a check in the mail. More aptly, his mom got a check in the mail. It's barely sixty dollars. He can't cash it immediately but he can deposit it in his mom's account and withdraw it since he has her card and she would never know. Don't even get me started on what the fuck is going no there but he fucking has custodianship over his mom's card to go food shopping, which he rarely does thanks to online grocery delivery. 

Of course, to get that $55ish dollar check into cash, somebody has to bring it to the bank. Maybe if I was desperate for one or two bags of H I'd jump for the chance to do it, but I'm not. Maybe it's the sub that I've been cutting into tiny pieces or that combined with the fact that I'm tired of this shit. Plus, $55 bux is not enough to get a $70 bun. Doesn't seem like my boy would have much to share.Perhaps he'll buy a half and a couple of subs?

Well either way, he needs to deposit his mom's $55 check before he can spend it. It'll take a couple of days to clear. Friday night I lied to Cliff when he asked me when I had work. I said 10AM instead of 11AM because if I said 11AM, he would've asked and expected me to take his check to the bank and deposit it for him. I run late for work as it is, if I can't be early or on time on for myself, I'm certainly not gonna do it for someone else nor am I going to let myself get to work even later because I did a favor for his lazy ass.

&nbsp;

A few days ago my friend assured me that he'd be getting a significant payout this weekend. At the time he was telling me a story of how he dropped three of his last bags of H outside and asked me for two bags. I was upset briefly and he mentioned that he bought me 3.5 buns last week when he in fact only bought 2.5 buns. So if he does get that weekend payout which now it looks like it's coming on Monday, I don't see any reason to accept any dope from him if when he buys it with his money. Next time I get paid, I don't want him to say he bought anything for me last week (which is presently this week).

&nbsp;

**Closing thoughts and lingering questions:**

* Will Cliff get his $400 payout on Monday? (It was originally said to be expected during the weekend - presented as ""the good news"")

* Will some street ass mofo toss bricks through Cliff's window? Stay tuned. That'll surely be worthy of it's own brief yet action packed post.

* Shit, Cliff still thinks I'm off from work tomorrow on Sunday. He's gonna be upset that I wont be able to deposit ~his check~ his mom's for him. I could theoretically do it since I work at noon. Maybe if I leave the house early enough I""ll text him and drop by his house on the way to work to pick up the check. I'm certainly not going to commit to it now. In all likelihood I'll just tell him I had to be at work at 11 before the bank opened so he can't say ""why didn't you bring the check to the bank for me?"" I usually run late even for the noon shift so making a stop at the bank isn't feasible for my sensibility.

* I'm really glad I copped one extra fresh sub. Obv I'm not telling Cliff I obtained an extra sub, I'll just pretend that the 3mg portion of a sub strip I have left is all I have left. Let's see if he asks any morsel of what I have left on Monday when the $400 he was expecting over the weekend still doesn't arrive. ",1506238064.0

in my time here i've seen various posts and comments about people being constipated for 3,5,8,12 days... etc. seriously, this is sooo dangerous. please don't let it get that bad. ""An intestinal blockage can be an emergency, especially if the intestine is twisted, because it can cut off the blood supply and cause part of the intestine to die."" you can also end up having to have part of your colon (or intestine, i don't remember which) removed if it gets perforated or from bowel obstruction or whatever it is. basically what i'm saying is it's fucking dangerous to go too long without going to the bathroom.

miralax works wonders, if you give it enough time. i dismissed it in the beginning, but kept taking it as a softener with 25 mg of senna but it works. and if it's really that bad, grab an enema. they're super cheap and super easy to use. but please, please, pleaseee don't let it get that bad. you don't need to put yourself through all that pain and discomfort either. idk, i just care about you all and don't want anything to happen to anyone because they didn't think it was that serious of a thing. i definitely didn't know how bad it was for you in the beginning.

It seems my penis has gotten smaller as a result of my opiate addiction. Basically, I have been on-and-off addicted to opiates for 7 years. As is typical, I started off with oxycodone then eventually became an IV heroin addict, and have tried many different methods of treatment, including opioid replacement maintenance and AA/NA.

Anyway, because of my opiate addiction, I have gone extremely long periods of time without getting an erection. Generally speaking, opiates reduce libido anywhere from slightly to entirely, but for me, opiate addiction causes a complete shutdown of my sexual function. No erections, no sex drive, no interest in women, nothing. 

So, upon getting clean for the 119th time recently, I started getting erections again and noticed that my hard dick looked a bit smaller than normal. As I got more and more erections, this perceived shrinkage started to bother me so I got out the ruler. 

The last time I measured my member was probably about 8-9 years ago when I was in my late teens/early 20s, and I remember it being somewhere around 6 1/4 inches hard. Now, when I measure it, it's about 5 1/2 inches. Fuck!

So I started researching this type of thing online and learned than long-term erectile dysfunction can lead to penile shrinkage because the sponge-like material that makes up one's penis size when erect begins to atrophy with long-term lack of blood flow. 

My understanding is that, as a result of my penis having long periods of time with abnormally low blood flow and zero erections, my penis's corpora cavernosa sinusoids have atrophied and I now have a smaller penis than I did pre-addiction, which makes getting clean suck even more than it normally does. Not only am I no longer getting high, but I also have this shrunken penis.

Anyway, has anyone else noticed this type of thing?",1506215376.0

I've always just kept it for the rare event that I do need the extra oomph of painkillers that the average ibuprofen can't fix. However, since I haven't needed to use it in a while, I recently learnt about CWE and decided I'd try out an opiate high.

I dissolved three 5-325 pills and one 30-300 pill to make an final extraction of approximately 15mg hydrocodone and 30mg codeine (probably less after the filtration). Drank it all in one go on a relatively empty stomach, and I started feeling some fuzzy effects about 15-30 minutes in.

I'm not sure I experienced ""nodding"", but as I was laying in bed on my laptop, I definitely started to close my eyes as if I was falling asleep, although I was still completely conscious. I put on some headphones and some soothing music, and for about half an hour, was in this state of what I would call ""conscious sleeping"".

However, in all this time, I don't think I ever experienced much euphoria, if any, just a general sense of comfiness. I did enjoy the fact that I can now eat spicy foods without the pain, as well being able to bite into ice cream without teeth sensitivity.

I looked into the mirror a couple times and definitely had [pinned pupils](https://i.imgur.com/Z0jNAhvr.jpg), so I know I did something correctly, I think I just expected more euphoria out of it. Does my experience align with anyone else's? Just wondering if I should've been doing some other activity other than just laying in bed surfing the web to maximize the high.

Side note: I won't be trying this again anytime soon since I used up all the pills I had left, and I'm not going to bother sourcing any more due to the (in my opinion) high potential of abuse.",1506214243.0

- [Half-Life Calculator](http://www.calculator.net/half-life-calculator.html) - Extremely useful if you want to estimate how much of a drug remains in your system. Useful for safe re-dosing.
- [List of Half Lives](http://www.globalrph.com/narcotic.htm) (Bottom of page)
- [TripSit Wiki](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Opioids) **Great** site for drug info but *I* use it for common dosing amounts. Shows you how much the average recreational user takes for a ""Light, Common or Strong"" buzz, also sorted by Route of Administration!

*Will be updating this tonight to be more complete for archival / searchability.*

--All of these sites information vary slightly. Some are more egregious than others. --

- To use the Half Life Calculator we're only going to use the ""Initial Quantity"", ""Time"" and ""Half Life"" fields.
- You put the amount of the drug, in this case, oxycodone,  that you took, say at noon. So let's pretend we took **90mg** at lunch time. 
- **90** goes under Initial Quantity, and under ""Time"" we put how much time has passed since we took it. Let's pretend it's 2:30pm, so we would put **2.5** under ""Time""
- The Half Life for oxycodone is 3.2 to 4.xx hours. I always go with the shortest as I have a strong tolerance and process oxy quickly so we'd put **3.2** under Half Life.
- Click Calculate and it gives us ""quantity remains, Nt = 52.367618644991"" or basically **52mg** remaining of the 90 mg dose we took at noon.
- This is useful because lets say that you feel like 120mg is about your personal limit that you don't want to exceed. In this case you now know that you have roughly 52mg floating around in you and you can re-dose accordingly.",1506210163.0

I'm sorry for this, you guys must hate these posts!!","Hi, I browse this subreddit all the time. I also use many types of drugs, never opiates.


This will be the least favorite post you will read. I got my wisdom teeth out Wednesday, was prescribed Percoset 5 mg. It worked alright for pain. I must not be very sensitive to them. There was no high, they dulled the pain, nothing special but I was happy with them. I was given 10, I used 4 of them. I can't find them anywhere, I think I lost them when I went for a follow up appointment.


However, I'm doing much better and won't need them, but tonight I'm going out to a low key house warming party and my tooth is in so much pain. I told my friend I would be there. All I want is one 5 mg Percoset. Just enough so I can talk. I'm not looking to get high or even buzzed. I've been prescribed opiates after a surgery in the past, used them for only a few days, then got rid of them. I don't think I have an addictive personality. 


That being said, I have about 10 10 mg codeine pills. I want to take something for the pain tonight. I'm not looking to get high. Just if 5 mg Percoset got rid of pain without getting me high, could codeine help? How much?

I mean puking every chance I get. Last Wednesday I picked up 11 opana 20s and then Thursday I picked up 22 of them for 440 bucks. I split the 11 with my wife and sold 2 of them. So I had 4 and 1/2. I did them all that night before and during work. This was before I got sick. Then when I got the 22 I had sold 2 of them so it left me and the wife with 10 a piece. I've been sick as fuck since Thursday. But yesterday I did 4 of them and I got up to throw up again and again. I laid back down in bed and the next thing I know, I'm in the back off the ambulance strapped down, freezing my ass off butt naked. They said  they had hit me with 2mg of narcan and that had brought me out of it. Then i get to the hospital and then they hit me with 8mg of narcan under the ruse that it was zofran. And it was zofran, mixed with narcan. The most awful feeling in the world washed over me. My whole body was on fire and my body was shaking from the cold hospital and cold fluids they were pumping into me. I kept begging for a blanket, anything more than a sheet that was so let for the purpose of covering up my dick. Then after 15 minutes they come in and tell me that my wife can't come back to see me until I've pissed for them and if I don't piss immediately then they are going to catheter me.

You all feel like family, just family I've never talked to. So here's my current story. It's a long read I know, sorry:

I've been using oxy recreationally for the past three years. Well, it started with Percs, but moved to oxy within the first few months. I started with snorting, but once I discovered IV I never looked back. For all my fellow IVDUs out there, I get it. Anyway, I know someone who fills a script for themselves and I buy some, so it's been nice and secure... quality stuff and I only get access once a month so keeping it recreational hasn't been a problem. I fill up, binge for a weekend, and go back to daily life.

Now things have changed though. My old source is gone, and I don't know anyone else who has oxy, or any opioid for that matter. Now I am at that junction that many of us get to: do I switch to heroin or not? I feel like it will be easier to find than IV worthy pills, and cheaper and all that jazz. I am a bit uneasy about the switch, but also kind of excited to start a new venture.

Before I continue, let me give you a little background about myself. I am college educated, I have a great job, and if you didn't know any better you'd think I was just another stiff. I have no kids, no wife, and barely any family connections to speak of. My life goals are different than for most. In my twenties, I wanted pretty much what everyone else does. Party, then settle down. I partied, and got that out of my system. Now when it comes to the settling down part, I don't really want the normal stuff anymore. I don't want kids and family, I have plenty of friends who have that and it just doesn't really appeal to me. Home depot on the weekends... talking about my lawn with the neighbor... soccer practice on tuesdays. Meh, not for me. I want to be high. I want to put in my forty hours at work every week then spend my weekends on the nod. I know it shortens life expectancy, but I don't really care. I know it can be hard to control, but nothing is impossible. I would ask if you think this kind of life is wishful thinking, but I think I already know what you'll say.

So now back to my main point. I am trying to decide about making that leap onto the h-train. I guess I will ask you all what you think about this, and if I should put in more work into trying to find another oxy provider or not. I like things about both, you know, pros and cons. One is safer and cleaner, the other is cheaper and more abundant. What do you all think?

 I'm going out later today to browse for something. It's been almost two months since I lost my connection and I'm sick of being sober. Wish me luck I guess, we will see what pops up.

But honestly, I can usually get it pretty cheap, and though I used to do soooo much more and had a much higher tolerance, after some forced withdrawals to lower said tolerance, I have finally managed an economical way to stay noddin' all day. 

For Suboxone, which I can get for $20 a strip, I can do one eighth in the morning, and another eighth in the afternoon and that has me feeling damn great all day. Bye bye insecurities, hello funny and sociable bittybites.

Zubsolv is my favorite though when I can't get the orange Suboxone tablets, as since the Zubs are in tablet form themselves, I can break them up into fourths and shave off a little bump whenever I want and STILL make it last longer than a Sub strip. Combined with BC powders and aspirin, I'm king of the world when I have a  Zub in my posession.

I know, obviously not the same as being addicted to H, but I've had stints with oxycodone and hydrocodone and I'm one of those super lucky great metabolizers of tram where 100mg my first time felt as strong as 10mg of oxy when I was opiate naive.

Anyway, recovery hasn't been easy for me. I tried posting in the opiates recovery sub but found most of the people there to be condescending assholes who would tell you the only way to feel better was to be straight edge and run marathons and eat nothing but salad and lean meat. I'm aware that diet and exercise are vital building blocks of recovery and I'd probably be doing better if I paid more mind to those things. But like, I've always struggled with depression and anxiety. Drugs just made it worse, but there was a reason I liked getting high so much to begin with.

So I'm almost 10 months clean. Sort of. I've relapsed sporadically on the pills but nothing crazy. Never for more than a day or two at a time and I've gone months without. Unfortunately ended back up on Kratom which I quit for about 6 months. I'm taking way less than I used to, but I don't like that I'm still taking it. I just feel like PAWS fucked my brain so bad.

I guess the real reason for this shitpost was cause I've been thinking lately that I'm almost a year out and while I'm glad that I'm not scarfing down handfuls of pills and getting sick waiting for refills and lying and being shitty like I used to, I've been thinking lately about how in 10 months, I've yet to feel as good as I did on the good days of using. And I guess that goes without saying. I'm not flooding my brain with dopamine and serotonin and norepinephrine like I did every day for 3 years. But while I was depressed before I started using, I feel like the lows were never as low as they have been since quitting, and the highs are never as high as they were before I started using. Some days I feel like I've fucked my brain forever and I don't know how to fix it, and that id be better off just going back to fiending over fucking tramadol.

What do you guys and gals who have quit for a decent length of time think? Am I gonna feel better one day?

It wasn't giving me any relief after about 6 mg into 9 hours of the day.  Right before I went to bed, I added another 2 mg.  I literally laid in bed with the WORST tooth & jaw pain I have ever experienced.. it seems as though the bigger the piece I dosed under my tongue, the more general soreness and pain it gave my whole entire head.

Having amazing mini dreams and body jerks that would wake me up so j could do it all over again and not waste hours while sleeping. 

The clean rooms, freshly washed sheets and pillows, non-stop cold A/C running and model home type furniture was perfect for the warm blanket of euphoria the strong opiates gifted me.

Roommate setting me up?,"I'll try to make this as brief as I can, but it is a bit long. Please bear with me, I need help/advice.

So a casual friend of mine had her husband go to prison last year for violating his parole on a felony drunk driving (he got caught with drug paraphernalia and came up positive on a UA).

Well, I felt sorry for her because without hubby's income she and her dogs were straight up going to be homeless. My girlfriend had just left me so I had an entire 3 bedroom all to myself, being the ""nice guy"" I am I offered to let her stay with me. Deal was, she could stay rent free as long as she kept the place cleaned up, bought food and generally kept an eye on me as I am a disabled vet with anxiety, PTSD and depression issues. I really don't do well alone and could use the company and liked the idea of having an adult around in case my depression and/or PTSD got scary (I have tried to hurt myself in the past and was scared due to the breakup something might go sideways).

Everything worked out great (absolutely NO sex or anything even close to that going on, purely roommate/platonic). She had her own bedroom and the extra room was furnished for her minor son when her visitation days were in effect.

He gets released and was only supposed to stay here until he found a job and they saved a bit and got their own place.

Things seemed fine at first then, shit went sideways. He starts doing drugs (speed and heroin, she starts using too), well, I am a few years clean and sober myself and told them to cut that shit out. Obviously they didn't. In short order his parole officer shows up for a visit and finds drugs in his room and off to jail they both go. She gets released the next day and promises no more dope. She checked herself into a detox place and spends a week getting clean, then starts outpatient treatment immediately upon release from detox. She seems genuinely sorry and was doing specific and determined actions to get shit squared away.

Well, I come home the other day and hubby made bail. Promises to also go into residential treatment as soon as he can find a place with an open bed.

Well, The yesterday I find a dirty spoon in the kitchen and tell him I am not putting up the BS anymore. They apologize and yadda yadda. I'm trying to figure out how to handle this shit (I empathize because I was a user once too).

Well, today I find a dirty heroin spoon and a bunch of needles hidden in the cushions of a recliner in my room. Rules are nobody ever goes into anyone else's room so it is not like someone ""accidentally"" had it fall out of a pocket or something. Obviously, I am 10,000% sure it is not mine.

My only thought is that one or the both of them think I'm going to rat them out to the cops or parole or the bail bonds folks and planted it to get me busted if a search happens.

Now here is the problem, obviously in the drug community there is nothing worse than a ""rat"" and that shit is responded to with violence, often EXTREME violence. I can't just ""call the cops"" or whatever because I can't just go all Hollywood and disappear or go into witness protection or any other stupid TV trope some people would like to think is street reality.

What the actual hell? Have no idea what to do here. With the added burden that I have been convicted of drug offenses three separate times in the past so it is not like the local cops are going to believe me anyway.

I think I'm fucked.

They are not on the rental lease but she's been here long enough to have established tenancy and the landlord knows she is here but she's never been put on the lease proper.

Any ideas?

TL:DR Drug addict roommate thinks I'm a ""rat"" and it looks like I'm about to get set up for something.

right well before I got on subs I was almost too scared to take it because of precipitated w/d.

I read even 40 hours isn't long enough, most ppl say 24 hours after dope.

I waited 12 hours first time and no problems, withdrawls gone.

second time I couldn't wait and took 2mg after 10 hours again no problem.

what the fuck is the deal? how much does metabolism and dose play into this?

I just read some guy say you have to wait 7-10 days... 

is there a single answer or is this shut extremely subjective? I've never even so much as felt a single withdrawl symtoms after taking it.

Lately, I have been getting an extreme amount of abscesses. Right now on my thighs, I have 20+ abscesses. I shit you not. Not tiny ones either, but medium to huge size. The pus is always the worst smell ever and the colors range from white to literal blacc. Also, I now get tiny chunks of unabsorbed heroin or cut in the pus. Recently, I have been getting internal abscesses. These are ones that are flat, but press down and very hot chunky fatty pus balls come out. They are liquid like, but actual blacc fatty balls that are squishy. I have a mix of those and the normal river abscesses on my thighs now. The pus from the flat ones come from really deep inside my thighs. You can tell the infection is eating my fat and then spitting it out when I press down. My friend, who is a former Navy Corman, told me that each abscess is a battlefield and that my body cuts out little sections to separate and defeat the infection. I thought hw was being his usual over exaggerating self, but I looked into one of the cavities from a drained abscess and, holy shit, he was spot on. The inside of my leg had sections cut out. It looked like the inside of a cardboard box. 

This scares me. I am scared for the immediate future cause I am homeless and can only shower like once a week. That leaves a long time for bugs, dirt and other nasty stuff to enter into these infections and cause severe damage. I am also scared that I might not be able to walk in the future. When I looked into that hole, I started to cry. My muscles are almost gone. It's so bad that the infection is eating my fat now. When they heal I feel them and I can almost feel all the way to the bone on some of them. There's like nothing left. 

I already am a fucc up and hate myself for what I've done to myself, but I don't think I would be able to live in a wheelchair. Besides quitting, what can I do? I am never quitting as I seriously don't think my fragile mental state could take the hole left in my life from quitting. I had a failed suicide attempt before when I tried quitting, I don't want to succeed next time. Please help me. I am in tears typing this. I honestly don't know if I will make it much longer.

I haven't actually tried writing out a schedule with dosing times yet, which I think will help because it leaves less room for me to say I'll do more earlier in the day and then just not do any later, but then when later comes, end up doing more anyway. This is the schedule I've written out and stuck to so far:

Thursday - did 12 bags
Friday - did 8 bags

Saturday (yesterday) - 6 bags
10am- 2
4pm- 2
10pm - 2

Sunday (today) - 4 bags
10am- 1.5
4pm-1.5
10pm-1

Monday (tomorrow) - 3 bags
10am- 1
4pm- 1
10pm- 1

Tuesday - 2 bags
10am- 1
10pm- 1
-or-
10am- 1
4pm-.5
10pm-.5

Wednesday - 1 bag
10am- 1 and stop here

10am- .5
10pm- .5 and stop here
-or-
10am- .5
4pm- .25

Thursday - .75 bags
10am- .25
4pm- .25
10pm- .25

Friday -  .5 bags
10am .25
10pm- .25

Saturday - .25 bags
10am - .25 and stop here

Does this seem too fast? And should I stop after I get to 1 bag per day or break it down even lower? I feel like it's gonna be hard to do a .25 bag shot, esp cause I have a really hard time registering and miss half the time. I just want to avoid withdrawals as much as I can, but if I can get to a point where they're mild enough, I have all the ""comfort meds"" that addiction doctors prescribe and could probably use them to get rid of any lingering symptoms. I wanna know what to expect if anyone has tried this before.

A burning pain right in the CNS and just pure fucking mental terror. Servere depression, anxiety, mild hallucinations. I layed in bed wrenched in pain, crying like a damn baby. it was the worst condition i have ever been in. I immidiatly then took 120mg oxy in capsules with 1mg xanax but it dind't went away, i still felt terrible after 35 minutes then i took 40mg crushed oxy powder and washed it down, i then began to feel better after 10 minutes or so. And what a relief i felt when i came to myself again! damn that felt great.
Anyway, i have been an idiot lately. I buyed a big stash of oxycontin and quickly began taking it multiple times a day, increasing my dosages day to day. 3-4 weeks ago i would get high of 40mg, now i need about 100 - 160mg. I feel like an idiot, because i always forget or ignore the fact that there is a high price to pay at the end.

It feels like the oxy i'm taking just flushes out of my body in no time. I can redose every 2,5 - 4 hours when i already feel mild WD, take a dose and then get high again.

I usually take a dose before going to bed but i was very tired yesterday so i just felt asleep without being ""high"" so that might have been the reason i woke up in that horrible condition, so i think it was 12 hours or so since i took my last dose when i woke up.

I still have a bunch of oxy left, but i want to get back on subs because being an oxy addict is not fun i the long term for me, because it just leaves my system so fast. If i could get by like many others and have 5-7 hours between my doses without feeling like shit after 2,5 - 3,5 hours and if my tolerance didn't skyrock in no time i wouldn't have any problem to keep using oxy. I fucking love the high, motivation and calmness it gives me but it's not worth it.

I have a bunch of subutex 2mg's as well, and i want to take sub daily instead of oxy. Because it doesn't leave my body so quick and the WD are much smoother and less servere. I want to be stable again, having a job and just melt in to a normal life again.

To the question - does it still mean i have to wait several hours further before taking the sub? Really? Shit man i'll kill myself before that if my condition will be that bad again, just kidding - but i don't think i can handle it. Its just, when i have so bad withdrawals i cannot imagine that anything being in the receptors still, not when my condition were that bad. Fuck man, i'm a little afraid to be honest.

I have some kratom and some kratom extract i made this weekend. I know for a fact that i can take kratom before sub without going into precipated WD. Do you think that taking a large amount of kratom can help with the WD's? Cause i could maybe stretch the time a little longer if needed IF kratom helps with WD. Does anyone have experience using kratom for oxy withdrawals when having a high tolerance?",1506436558.0

Beforehand, said friend was supposed to front me 3 Adderall and deliver them on top of it. 3 hours after him agreeing to do so he finally arrived with them. Except there's only 2. And when we made the deal I told him since he was fronting and delivering 3 of them I'd give him $20 once the money cleared. Well when he finally got here we worked something up to get a couple of bags for $15. I was the only one with money though. Once we got that squared away, he ended up getting 4 more bags for loaning out his car to the dboy for the night and he blessed me with a bag. I told him I'd give him $20 for that favor. Well when the time came and the money cleared he was on his way to get me. Well once we got to the gas station he proceeds to tell me that he told the people he was riding with that they were gonna be getting $20 for gas and such and asked if I'd meet him halfway with that and I agreed. While I was buying my cigarettes and the gas he said ""just go ahead and put the $20 on it and I said no, that I wasn't paying for all that on top of giving him $40. These bags have been going for $20/bag (keep in mind H is never around my neck of the woods). Well I had him $60 and tell him to get me 3 bags. He comes back out with 2 and says he said they were $30/bag. I said man come on. I hate when a downer schemes and plots like a tweaker. My friend is on some real crackhead shit. But I guess there's some light at the end of the tunnel because the H is pretty fire. I give it a 7/10!*
Thanks for tuning in I suppose lol.

White boys sitting in their car on the street in an all-black neighborhood stick out like a sore thumb. So when you decided to keep stringing me along with the ""20 more minutes"" and ""I'm pulling up"" shpiel for **more than two hours** instead of just telling me you're tied up until the evening, the local neighborhood drug dealer took notice and now I have a new plug. One that gives me stronger drugs at a better value. That serves me in less than five minutes. That respects his customers.

When you inevitably hit me up in three days and ask ""U good"" I'm  not even gonna answer.

Its the no bowel movements, not having enough money to get a big mac at McDonalds, having no friends because you cut off everyone, waking up EVERY morning with zero motivation to get out of bed and do anything till you get high, and just the pure misery you feel everyday in your heart because you are a slave to a substance. I have had cleaned time, I have relapsed more times than North Koreas failed missile test, I have had great and absolutely terrible times in my life. The thing that's crazy about all of this though? You can change it, and it doesn't cost anything. It just comes down to how much effort YOU want to put into it. Anyone that knows what clean time feels like knows what I mean to say nothing feels better in life than truly being clean. I am not talking about being on Suboxone or even smoking weed. Not, knocking either of those, Suboxone is great drug to get your life back on track. I am just stating to be completely clean means to be substance free. That feeling is like being high everyday in its self. You can pass a bowel movement without feeling like you might have to go to the ER, you can go to sleep right away and sleep through the night, people actually enjoy hanging out with you and trusting you more, you can take care of all of your finical situations, and be able to have your own life. This won't apply to everyone. If you are getting high, and are able to still take care of your responsibilities then bravo to you I am jealous of you. I for one can not balance the two. This is for the people out there right now, fucking suffering and ya you, its okay man. You can fucking stop all this shit literally right now.

Any danger? Usually tolerance is 120+ of the IR.

Woke up this morning before work, had some boy for breakfast.  It wasn't much, but a good amount to make it through the day.  Work is going pretty well (doing some demo work in some mobile homes) and I'm feeling very good about the day.  

Lunch comes around.  My dude and I share some of his leftover chinese, and we were hanging out with one of the dudes he works with.  At the end of lunch, he starts cutting some lines out of the blue.  In that moment, I thought it was some white lady.  I snort my line and it burns like fuck.  ""Damn, what is this shit cut with?  This lady burns like fuck.""  I find out....  I'm snorting meth for the first time ahaha.  A minute or two goes by and I'm feeling nice as fuck.  Mild euphoria and totally AWAKE if you will.  The dude calls it gogo powder.  

We go back to work, I'm sweating balls, feeling really good.  Like, totally didn't even want any cigarettes.  In the time that I'd smoke 4, I smoke none.  Sweet, cool, whatever.  

Couple hours go by, we finish and end up home.  I wash my cotton from the morning.  Does little to mellow me out, but I get the rush.  I wasn't super speedy at this point, but certainly obvious it's still doing its thing.  

My dude goes to go scoop, comes back with some crack as well.  I like shooting crack, coke is better.  Crack is like... the more mild, slower onset version whereas coke makes your mind ejaculate.  Really like shooting coke, especially with a couple bags.  Anyways, I put my crack together, lemon juice, no boy on this one.  I barely feel the rush that I normally do, which I know for sure is because I'm already dopamine'd up from the meth.  

Do another shot, some bags in this one.  Don't really know what I'm thinking.  I feel like my heart is going to explode.

Heart racing, do some more boy to chill out.  Force some food.  Now I'm here commenting on every damn post I have any sort of knowledge towards. 

And yeah, shit post, that's why I'm chatty.  Enjoy your nights, however you may be doing so, and one goes out to my homies who are currently hurting, and may your dboy be swift and give you a reasonably quoted time to get served.  See yall around.",1506390730.0

I love the E40’s honestly. I can get 2-3 knee bending shots out of just one of these bad boys. I got the dremel method down to the point where I can prep one in 5-10 mins and not really waste any. I know there’s a real risk using these and getting TTP, but nothing compares to these soooo.... lol

Now I’ve recently gotten switched to the G74’s. Honestly, I hate them compared to the E40’s. Only thing I like is that I know it’s cleaner. But the alcohol extraction is in efficient without proper equipment and even after figuring out a good home brew method to extract I still think it takes way to long.
Only cool thing is a can collect all the used pucks of powder  and put them in one oral syringe and let it sit over night with alcohol and in the morning I push it through and get a small shot out of it usually.

What’s everyone’s opinion on these? And all other opana while were on the topic. I would take a E40 over 4 x 10mg IR Oxymorphone honestly. It seems like the e40s pack the biggest punch.",1506388988.0

Could anyone spare some advice please? Its as if no matter how much suffering ive been through, or how close i am to feeling 'normal' (before i began smoking H)-- i always find myself going back :/ 

If i quit, Id be doing really well-- at a great uni, could earn back my old physique (i used to be a bodybuilder, started at age 15, but the past year lost 10kg of muscle due to the dope).

Nothing i do is working so far, and have attempted to relapse several times this month (unsuccessfully)

please, wiser dope fiends with more experience-- talk some fucking sense into me before my deathwish comes true.

Im thinking i should start taking low daily doses of aderall again, as that usually counters my depression, and had the most productive/happy year of my life on it-- but then after quitting, my dope use became breakfast, lunch and dinner; rather than chipping. I experienced 0 negative side effects from self medicating with amphetamines, apart from depression after abrupt cessation.

So let's assume you have fresh, healthy, immaculate virgin veins. Where do you start, and where do you go to once you rotate injection sites?

I start with the ol' faithfuls in the crooks of my arm on both sides. Then I use the smaller ones next to them, but only a couple of times because they hurt like a motherfucker. After that I switch to the long ones on the inside of the forearms. It pops really nicely with a tourniquet (and yes, I remove it before I shoot!) and is pretty easy to hit. After that I move on to my hands, the veins there are super visible and are surprisingly thick (although I do have some meaty paws) and I don't mind hitting those at all, despite what I've read that says they're a last resort for a lot of people. They don't really track up or bruise as much as other sites, either.

I know you aren't lawyers (well most of you likely) so was just hoping to hear about some experiences.  I got arrested 2 years ago June 2015 with 3 bags.  The judge had said that as soon as I made the first payment that was when the probation would start but I paid all the payments and they never called me.  I looked through all the papers I got and never found a number to call.  Well I had gotten clean in anticipation of the probation and stayed clean until November 2016.  Around then I relapsed and then in January received a letter from the courts saying for me to come in.  I called them and found out that they were just then starting the probation.  I was using then though so I never went to probation which was scheduled for April of this year.  Then I got a letter saying for me to come to court early June.  Well I got clean a day after that court date so I missed it.  So I have a new court date for today.  I've been really scared that I'm going to show up and just be arrested.  Can anyone tell me what they think would happen? Looking for any insight.  Thanks.,1506368023.0

It is true the bad symtoms last about 3-5 days but it is by far the worst feeling i have ever felt.

I just remember setting my cigarette down in the ashtray and everything went black. I woke up almost an hour later and my entire soda had spilled out into my lap. I thought I'd just nodded out hard so 30 minutes later I did another line and smoked some boy then got in touch with my buddy /u/OpiLobster. After I told him what happened, he made me realize I hadn't just nodded. I OD'd. 

I've gotta stop because I know if I don't I'm going to die. I'm supposed to be getting subs this week and they can't come soon enough. I'm trying to take it easy now and only doing enough to stay well. For the first time in a while I don't want to die. Sorry for the shit post I just needed to write this out so later, when I'm sick, I can read it and remember why I'm quitting. I've been back and forth on this sub saying I'm going to quit and it's all been bullshit. I'm hoping this time it's for real and I can do it. 

Thank you /u/OpiLobster for being such a solid friend and staying up with me last night to make sure I didn't die. I owe you man.

**Edit**: I'm out of it and didn't add details that are kind of important to the story. I said this in a reply to someone in the comments but thought I'd add it here..

I woke up, from my blackout, feeling like shit. My head hurt really bad. I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face and I looked like shit too. My whole face was stark white and my lips were a really pale bluish color. It kind of freaked me out. I splashed water on my face and drank some water too. Because my head hurt I dosed again..and because, apparently, I have a death wish. That's when I got in touch with my friend, because, the more I thought about it the more worried I got. I asked him if he thinks I just nodded out hard or if it was an OD. He said he thinks I OD'd and I think he's right. He's been using way longer than I have so he's kind of my dope mentor of sorts.

I know it takes a bit to break through that first run and get real WDs and I just haven't hit it....yet. 

I even made it off 12mgs of daily suboxone without much discomfort. Tapered really really low and it was fairly easy other than some sleep issues and...

The crushing, near suicidal depression! I've been using daily for a couple weeks and right now I'm using some fire tar. I'm smoking it though, which means it doesn't last very long and by the time I wake up I'm starting to ""withdraw."" 

Which for me means absolute mental hell! I feel like there's absolutely nothing to live for, life is absolutely futile, we all die anyways so what's the point, etc, etc. 

It's like super depression on steroids. Absolute exhaustion and the bleakest mindset you can imagine. 

But then I use and it goes away. Ever since the suboxone I don't even really get that high. No nods or nothing, just a mood boost. I feel *normal* when I'm high and no matter how much I do I never seem to break into euphoric fucked-up-ness, just feel good. 

Is this pure tolerance and nothing else? Is crushing mental withdrawal a symptom of the physical withdrawal to come? I'd much much rather deal with the physical aspect (I did experience WDs when I went through PWDs once) than the mental. I can handle the physical but the mental makes it almost impossible to not say fuck it and score. 

I feel like I've been living a lie. I was worried about physical withdrawal and laughing it off when it's the mental aspect that drives us back to the arms of heroin. I just didn't think the mental withdrawal was that bad for some reason...oops.

It was the PAWS that got me to use again after two years too.  Not suicidal depression, just a grinding apathy and anhedonia I couldn't shake no matter how hard I tried.

I have allergies so I have taken benadryl all my life, so I have a good tolerance to it.. but why doesn't the hydroxyzine work as well as the benadryl for me? Am I not taking enough?

Would love to here yours. Shitpost I guess.","I'm always curious what led people down whatever road they are on. Whether it led to pills, heroin, crack, etc.


I'm mid thirties, happily marrried, teenage daughter. Nice house, great 6 figure job, the works.

Good job, but stressful. During a particularly stressful time, I was having panic attacks a lot, everything was overwhelming. I feel my neck, and it's all bumpy, rashy. Then saw it all over half my chest and my arm

I had been having some arm pain, but ignored it. Went to the gym a lot, had shoveled a lot of snow, etc.

Well after the rash I go to the ER, and they diagnose me in 2 seconds. Shingles! In mid thirties! I thought it was an old person disease. Fucking terry bradshaw commercials.

Well I caught it late, so the valtrex (herpes med haha) didn't work. So basically the solution? Pain meds. Percs.

Lemme tell know, I was in so much pain. Gabapentin didn't do shit. Lyrica fucks me up, tried it and ended up in the hospital. 104 fever, losing my mind. No clue.

All that worked was percs. 

So it goes from there really. My primary gave me them for about 8 months (I also convinced him I hate Tylenol, so 10mg oxys) and then wanted to wean 
Me, I switched docs. 2 months later went to pain management. Epidurals, nerve blocks didn't do shit.

So I'm still in real pain, but I'm using the painkillers for stress relief. Addicted. Never thought I'd be here. I have my own script, and a buddy whose I get very fairly.

Supply lasts 10 days or so, then 20 days on Kratom with some Xanax and kpins mixed in. Up to around 120mg or more to get nodding.

So that's my story. Never thought I'd get here. I'll never buy off the dnm or street. Too scared. Money isn't the issue. If it was guarenteed pharmacy it would be different. But the cutting and mixing is so fucked up. People who cut and press with fent and lie should be executed. Fuck them. I figure one day my scripts will run out. They think I have some permanent nerve damage, which blows. But once it does I think, and hope, I'll be done with this.

Like I said, longtime lurker, have gotten some nice harm reduction, asked a lot of questions. Had a second and figured I'd throw a backstory up. Genuinely curious if anyone wants to share the wacky way they ended up an addict. 

Thanks everyone! I'm sure I'll have more questions as I try to be safe",1506476408.0

Always was on time and never gave me any issues. Lately I’ve cut my dope consumption way down and only cop when my boy cops. So I get to the hood after taking a 2 hour bus and train ride there. Meet up with him and everything is smooth as always. But after I leave I notice a cop car is following me through the fucking hood! I act super nonchalant and make my way into a building and then they leave...fuckers....

So I get down into the train station and decide to snort a few bags for the long ass ride home. I take out two bags and them fuckers is empty! At this point I didn’t even doubt him I just thought, well maybe it’s just two empty bags and shit happens and the rest should be okay....NOPE!!!! They all empty!!! I just spent $200 on empty god damn bags! Of course he’s blocked my number and my billion phone calls from diff numbers and private he don’t pick up. I swear if I didn’t have a life I would be in the hood every single day to find him and beat the living shit out this hood rat with his dumbass durag (sp???). 

So now I take two hours to get back home, where my boy who has a car that I cop with, is gonna take me to fuckin Bumblefuck to go cop 3 buns. Just waiting on my boy to come back with the goodies so we can both do some awesome shots!

I walk out the front doors of this Food Lion sipping this Pepsi, but the only thing on my mind is how long it's gonna take this dopeboy to get his fucking ass here. He lives less than two blocks away, and he's usually on point, but that's no solace. I tell myself, ""Ten minutes. Twenty, tops.""

Once outside I survey the area for any sign of a slightly short, young black dude, who is usually wearing a bright red Washington Nationals ballcap, the requisite long white tee, jeans, and light amber Timberlands. No dice. I look across the parking lot and see the cable truck. There's a shadowy outline of Rory's head in the window. I get in and Ro-Ro's got the phone on the edge of one knee so it can get a signal, the other knee bouncing like it's attached to a fucking jackhammer.

I say, ""Fuck, come on man. Let's GO!""

Ro-ro replies, ""Waiting is half the work.""

Waiting is fucking all the work. I look into the console and see the forty rock of crack we already procured from the cut ten minutes earlier, from a house so goddamn rickety I can't believe it hasn't already fallen in. There are holes in the floor you could put manhole covers over, the rest of the floor is plywood, but they've always got white of any stripe, and the crack is always good.

Absentmindedly, my hand drops below the seat where my vinegar is stashed, indispensible in prepping the crack for shooting. I have to reach a little farther than I thought, but my hand touches the plastic, and I'm suddenly comforted to know that it's there. I take another sip of the Pepsi.

The phone rings. ""All right, I'll be up there,"" Ro-ro says, and in one fluid motion he hangs up, drops the phone in the seat and makes his way to the side of the store, where he'll make the exchange. I can feel the surge of adrenaline, serotonin and absolute giddyness when I see him make the handoff.

Rory gets back in and I say, ""That go all right?"" He nods and shows me the 5 bags as I take the crack out of the console, along with the spoon, cigarette filter, and put them on the seat. 

This is where I usually lose my lunch, and I am not disappointed. I open the door just enough, lean out and fucking let it go. The Pepsi looks the same coming out as it did when it went in. Ro-ro's savvy enough for this action to barely register on his radar, he's seen it so many times he just continues fixing everything up and only off-handedly comments, ""You've got it bad, son"". No shit.

I come back up, wipe my mouth with a napkin and see that he's got 3 bags in the spoon. Big puppies. He hits it with the water, pops a cotton on top and draws it all up. 

I put half the rock in the spoon.

""Not too much, now,"" he says as he always does, I reply with my standard, stern, forceful, ""I'll... be... fine."" I hit the rock with about twenty units of vinegar, reveling in the satisfaction of the fizzing and bubblng the rock does, then stir it up, pop the cotton back on it and pull it up. Ro-ro pushes out half the dope from his syringe and goes to work.

I pull mine up, cue up the syringe and get fucking ready. This is it. This is where I want to be, forever about to put a fat fucking speedball in my veins. If I could live in any twenty seconds of time in my life for eternity, this is where it would start. This place, this time, with no equivocations. It's no contest, no question.

I register in the pit, and shoot it fairly quickly, so that all the coke in the syringe hits at the same time, in hopes of a bellringer. No luck there, but the rush is amazing, transcendent, spellbinding, immaculate. Decadent in a way whoever invented the word wouldn't have been able to comprehend.

After about twenty more seconds, during which my eyes roll so far into my head I think I'll never get them back, I know what little is left of that Pepsi is on its way back up, but it mostly just turns out to be a few dry heaves. I come back up, wipe my mouth, turn the key in the ignition and drive off into the motherfucking sunset.",1506465971.0

I'm a freelance journalist currently working on a story about the effects of drug laws on people and society. Specifically: The ""drug induced homicide"" laws under which a person can be charged with murder if they give or sell drugs to someone who subsequently dies from ingesting them. These laws are most frequently applied in the realm of opiates and synthetic opiates.
From my research thus far, it's my understanding that these laws do nothing to stop people from using opiates, and punish people (often addicts themselves) for providing drugs to consenting adults who are fully aware of the risks involved. They may also keep people from getting help for friends or acquaintances who need medical attention for fear that they'll be arrested and charged.
I've already spoken with someone at the Drug Policy Alliance and have some hard facts and statistics, and I'm now looking for personal stories to include in my article.
Have you been personally affected by these laws? If so, I'd like to hear from you.
You can have a fake name in the article, but I'll need to be able to verify your story in some way and keep your real name and contact info on file for fact-checking purposes.
By including the personal stories of current and former drug users, I'm hoping to put a human face on the issue and raise public consciousness of the often flawed way U.S. law enforcement and policymakers currently handle both overdose deaths in particular, and drug addiction in general. 
Thanks in advance!

It was a hot summer, humid, the kind of heat that lays thick over the city like a blanket. I was younger then, and as loathe as I am to admit it, I really did believe I was invincible.

As my drug use sky rocketed, so did my expenses. It wasn't long before I was running out, unable to get my guy on the phone to get me well enough for work. I started getting complacent, taking days off when I was 'too sick to work'. Now that I look back on it, if I had tried harder, I could have gotten through my days. The truth of it was that I just didn't want to expend the effort.

As I continued missing more and more days, the ice I skirted on at work got thinner and thinner. ""Don't worry, man."" my friend Lude had told me.

""I can get you a different kind of work, if you really need it.""

Of course I lost my job before the summer was even out. At first, I didn't want to take Lude up on his proposition. I was stubborn, and I wanted to prove that I could survive without any help. I was still shooting anything I could get my hands on into my veins, getting by on odd jobs and sketchy Craigslist gigs.

Before long, I was looking at losing my apartment. I finally had to suck up my pride and ask Lude for help. We met up at an old biker bar, the kind where the air fills your mind like a fog and the bar top its liable to give you splinters. Slouched over my drink, I confided in my friend.

""You remember that job you mentioned a few weeks ago? I..."" I forced the words out. ""If you can get me work, I really need it.""

Lude laughed as I said that, a dark kind of laugh that trailed off in a vocal ellipses, his own little prelude warning me of what may come. It should have set my alarm bells off. As it was, I was wading through life and desperately closing my eyes to any red flags that stood in the way of myself and money, or rather, myself and my drugs.

""Listen man, I wasn't exactly serious about that. I can get you work if you really need it, but you aren't gonna like it. I know a guy I can get you in touch with, let me find his number.""

Just like that, I was an escort. I say escort because it sounds easier on the ears, but the truth was I was nothing more than a cheap prostitute. It's hard to think of yourself in those terms. For a long time, I really just thought of myself as 'a guy who fucks dudes for money', staunchly ignoring the fact that I was really describing prostitution. It took a long time to admit to myself that was what I had been doing. It's funny how you can trick yourself like that.

The man that Lude set me up with was an... Older gentleman. He was well over 70, oxygen tubes strapped to his face and wrinkled as if he ought to be on his way to the morgue, not trolling for 20-somethings to take advantage of. That man became one of my regular customers. Despite his age, and some antisemitism that I purposely ignored, he really wasn't that bad to be around.

One day shortly after I began servicing the crypt keeper, as I was washing body fluids off my ass and thighs with one of his embroidered wash clothes, he asked me if I needed new clients. I had really only been servicing him, being anxious to get out in the street or back page websites looking for my own clients. I really did need new clients, and I told him so. He said he had a couple of friends who had been looking for a discreet guy such as myself. That day before I left, he sent me off with a list of phone numbers that rang the land lines of his ancient perverted friends.

And that's how I became a professional grandpa fucker.

One of the worst things was the smell. You know that patented old people smell, that mix of urine and medicine and something else I was never able to put my finger on. That smell clung to each and every one of them, and you never quite get used to it. Though, one day, I saw a tin of vicks vapo rug next to my client's bed. Without him seeing, I snatched the tin and gingerly rubbed a tiny bit under my nostrils. Since then, vicks vapo rub has been a staple of mine in my grandpa fucking kit. I carry it everywhere.

The work itself wasn't all bad. Of course it was generally terrible, and I had to learn more than I ever wanted to know about fucking around medical  devices, colostomy bags, various fistulas, and oxygen tanks. Rattling coughs, creaking joints, cuckoo clocks and medical beeps became the every day noise of my work. After a while, the cacophony was familiar, almost soothing. Why do old people always have so many cuckoo clocks?

Most of my clients were too decrepit to participate in some of the more athletic sex positions, so my work was often pretty leisurely. Most of them wanted strip shows, blow jobs, massages, and things of that nature. Relatively few were ever interested in having anal sex with me, and the times I did let them perform it on me were hardly the worst parts of my job. If I'm honest, the wrinkles give the sensation a little extra friction, which is surprisingly pleasant.

The jobs I did decline were performing anal ON a client with myself as the top, due to incontinence being a common issue, and one strange old man who wanted me to put things in the hole his colostomy bag was connected to. Oh, and one man who wanted me to help him with his catheter. That was actually common. I always had to remind them that I wasn't their nurse, you don't normally fuck your nurses, and the night nurse will be in in a few hours to trade shifts.

All in all, fucking grandpas isn't the worst job I've ever had. I've come to love it, truly. I love my grandpas and they love me. I've been in the field of grandpa fucking for a decade now, and have a dedicated client base and a respected name in the community. And as a bonus, I always get a werther's original at the end of the day. Thats what it's all about, in the end. That's why I still fuck those grandpas to this very day. I want those werther's originals.",1506460008.0

I am so thankfull for this sub firstoff. But I wanted to know whom of you guys have a depression (hope its called like that)? And can help me. Infos to my current situation: my dad died nearly 2 years ago and I started taking pills 2 month after his death for a 3 month time then got clean for 2 month started pills again and now I am doing boy. It helped me first to feel smth other than the hurtings of my loss. I talk to a woman much she helps ppl who die in there last days and then helps the family of the died one to handle the loss. Its called hospice. I can handle now the dead of my dad and I can accept and life with that since one year now. I mean yeah the first part of losing someone who is you such near like your dad can take up to 7 years after that you should start with part 2 your new life. I didnt started part 2 yet but she says that I will be start it in the next time. She cares about me and its normal to crie and miss him. Everyone who knows me knows really that I can handle it and that I can go through this. But in the last month I got depressed much more than its only this loss situation(again sorry for my bad englis I try my best so you guys can understand me but I dont know the right english word and google translate just get with strange words to me if I translate them from english back in my language) so now I talked to that woman by the way she is a psychatrist but works in the hospice helping ppl like me through their tough times. She said first that its normal to get depressed from time to time in my aituation but now after I told her about my actual feelings she said that I should go to a psychologist cause it sound like I really have some depressions. I contacted the two ones she said to me she knows them and that they will fit to me. Now what I wanted to ask you guys who of you got depressions too and how much does your addiction influence that? I never told anyone else than you guys about my addiction and I dont want to tell it to the psychologist cause here in this small town I life you dont want to tell anyone that you are doing dope. And otherwise its like my little secret that I just dont want to tell anyone I know. Hope you guys understand what I want to say. Happy nods fam ❤,1506458172.0

(I’m sure many of you are thinking a small benzo dose would be perfect for this application, and I’ve tossed the idea around too. Every time I’ve taken a benzo I end up falling asleep, and I’d much rather take a drug from a class I’ve had numerous experiences with; I also already have the before-mentioned meds). 

Last two times I’ve taken morphine, I really didn’t get high off it. But it gave me quite a sense of relaxation, and I’m thinking this would be ideal for my purpose. 

I know tramadol is severely weaker than morphine, so I’m curious as to which would be better to take first?

I’m not looking to get high (necessarily) off this dose, moreso just wanting some guaranteed relaxation in the moment, if that makes sense. 

The morphine I have is 2.5mg/ml. I plan on boofing it, no way I’m shooting. Last time I did the stuff (about a week ago, little less), I did two goes of 60ml (prob 10-15min in between doses) and didn’t feel too much at all for hours. This was the next day after doing about 40ml, so I know I jacked up my own tolerance. (Usually get right off of 30-50mg of hyrdo). 

Had some mild effects later that night which I thought was strange...I am having multiple BM’s before putting things up my ass, so I know it wasn’t wasted in feces. 

I was thinking of taking a couple tramadols to help potentiate the morphine (again, not looking to nod off mid presentation). Probably 200mg tops.

Presentation is at 9:30 am Thursday. Just curious of yalls thoughts. My buddy told me he felt more effects from taking the morphine sublingually, but this bioavailability is significantly lower than rectal even at he highest threshold; I’m not convinced. ",1506453920.0

I am having some very weird symptoms after a night of some dumb drug use. I am not a very frequent opiate user but I figured I'd come here to get some advice.

so 2 nights ago this went down:

snorted very small dose of u47700 aka ""Pink"" about 10 times during a 6 or 7 hour period. dose was probably about .5 or full size of a pea. Sorry I really dont know dosage very well. This was my first time using this ever, and very rarely ever use opiates in general.

Smoked probably around 7 cigarettes during this time

smoked about two small bowls worth of weed during this time too

also was drinking a bit of caffeine during this time.

during one time while I was smoking a cigarette, I got a horrible head rush and felt very nauseous. but i sat down and felt fine after about 5 mins and proceeded on feeling fine 

my problem is that its been about 48 hours since this night, and Im still not feeling normal. My head feels very dreary and cloudy, and I just feel very tired and can't focus. Ive gotten plenty of sleep and tried exercising and that hasn't helped. I also haven't lost my appetite and I dont feel physically ill or crappy. its all just in my head, like i have a mild migraine and headache and cant focus and feel like im in a mild dreamlike state.

Has anyone experienced this before? a bad sort of hangover in the head that persists days after use?

are you someone who enjoys the nod? do you prefer the euphoric  opiates like oxy that are less nod incuding and more energising to get things done?

your favorite opiate, maybe you enjoy analogues like carfentanyl despite how much the media bashes those analogues for their danger

I personally adore #4 China white heroin insufflated. I can't get enough of letting it consume me and setting me of the land of nod.

I enjoy oxy in terms of pills but it doesn't compare to Heroin for me - and because I'm a Englishman, means I've never had the privilege of trying most painkillers like even soccer moms of the usa, as we know America is the opiate Mecca - Vicodin, opana, dilaudid etc - wish i could try a good IV shot of dillies...

Literally the most ridiculous abusive job I've ever had. Managers get people suspended for being late by 1 minute when there is a 7 minute rule where you're allowed to punch in at most 7 minutes late. I constantly was harassed by coworkers and mentally abused by them and not to mention they know Im a chronic pain patient and would always make me take out the garbage in my department.. Keep in mind the garbage is not something I should do alone I could seriously injure myself. Each garbage box can be up to 100lbs due to the bitch cutting the fruit putting watermelon in it. But anyways I'm getting off Track. I bit the bullet and quit outright. So I had an interview on Tuesday for a place called tropical smoothie Cafe. The people there are super nice. And as far as I can tell there are no moments where I'd be forced to lift 100lb boxes by myself and risk injury. The pay is better and not to mention the manager told me after training since they need the help of probably get 40+ hours a week and the pay starts out better. I'll be making 10.75 to start then after training I'll get 11. Which is amazing!!

Win!

Anyway, I've been given a pretty good supply of 50 x 5mg valium and 28 x 10mg targin that I can resupply every 6 weeks. I'm actually hooked on opium, so I was hoping to use the oxy to ween myself off opiates altogether...but in the meantime, to celebrate finally getting an oxy script, I want to have a bit of fun with them for the weekend.

Now, there's some debate about the effectiveness of naloxone through ROA. Obviously you can't shoot it (I don't use needles anyway), and I've had success before grinding them up and parachuting...but I'm wondering if you can snort these pills as they are quite small? What about sublingual?

The jury seems to be out on naloxone and ROA bioavailability. Many think that it's bioavailable through the nasal membranes, but this doesn't make sense if sublingual ROA is OK. I've only ground them up and parachuted these pills in the past, and I can confirm that nalaxone has no bioavailability through oral administration, even if you break the slow release barrier through grinding the pills. I'm fairly certain the naloxone is only in there to prevent shooting the drug, but I could be wrong.

Does anyone here have experience with plugging/snorting/sublingual absorption of oxy/naloxone blends, and if so, does the naloxone kick in through either ROA? The last thing I want to do is grind these up and snort them only to end up in PWD.

Thanks in advance for any advice",1506590814.0

I usually just lurk around here, loving this sub.. but now I really got a problem.. need advice.. dunno if I'll find answers here or should rather post in some law related sub...
But let's try here first.. 
So I've been taking opioids for a long long time.. never had any real problems coming along with it.. guess I could be called one of the functioning kinda addict.. always had job, always made enough money to support my habit., mostly tho I think it worked out well so far because I mostly do opis for balancing my depressions.. so rather rarely doing doses aiming at nodding out, but rather in the range that take away my anxieties and keeping depression at bay.. I'd lie if I'd claim I don't enjoy nodding, especially since I switched to dope from oxy.. but.. still.. mostly I do it because without them I fall into real real deep dark holes..I used to regularily take breakes from it., which is not that much of a problem if tapering down first and then slowly withdraw.. (my job allows me to be off like 3months every year so I go on travels) first few weeks being clean were always nice and I could enjoy myself even without drugs, but after a while, sometimes sooner sometimes later, my depressions would come back and ppl who deal with depressions know how much it can affect you, your thinking, your personality, how your thoughts get darker and darker and how suicide seems to be the only logical way out.. which I know is bullshit when I'm in a good state of mind.. I have a good life, I have a loving family., but.. all that is forgotten in those phases.. I tried the SSRI route many years ago but it wouldnt work well., assume my problems rather come from a dopamin deficency then serotonin.. 

Anyway.. so my problem.. I recently got in trouble with the law.. not too serious, but I'll be on probation starting in like 2 months.. I could now get clean.. but without help of opiates I will be in serious trouble very soon.. which will make me either relapse or commit suicide.. 
 so my question.. if I'd go into suboxone treatment now, before probation starts.. will this be a violation of my probation once it all starts?  Sorry, my english sucks, hope it is understandable.. thanks in advance for any kinda advice.. be well guys.. ",1506589591.0

It is not yet clear whether I'll be making a plea deal, entering a diversion program, or fighting it all the way to trial. My lawyer is also looking into making some sort of deal with the da where we push back the next court date, I do some community service and don't get in trouble again for a period of time and the charges are dropped in return. It sucks cause I wasn't high at the time, I was falling asleep in the passenger seat of a car, partially because it was like 2am and partially because of medical issues that caused extreme fatigue (I had just gotten out of the hospital and was still wearing my wristband). Obviously I wasn't making a scene and this wasn't exactly in public so public intoxication doesn't really make sense. The paraphernalia wasn't mine either; it was in the side pocket of the passenger side door of the persons car I was in, and I didn't know it was there since it was dark and I wasn't looking for it - the cop only found it because he was looking for it with a flashlight. I had absolutely nothing on me and I pretty much begged them to drug test me but they kept saying no once the one guy said they could arrest me for constructive possession just for being in the car (even though I would have had to know about the paraphernalia to be convicted of that). At first the guy that was talking to me was saying I could drive the car home if I passed the drug test, but he changed his mind after the constructive possession thing from the other cop. This other cop was the one who wrote the police report and said he observed through my speech/behavior signs of intoxication even though he didn't talk to or interact with me once that night. These charges stressed me out so much that I started doing dope again, rather than vice versa. I felt like I may as well get high if I was gonna have to suffer the consequences anyway, like I may as well get the good parts out of it and actually deserve the punishment.

Anyway, what kind of stuff looks good and will make them more likely to work with me? Should I go to NA meetings (I heard these are just gonna be creepy dudes preying on me but I wouldn't be doing it for my own benefit, I'd be doing it to look good to the people involved in making the decisions regarding my charges)? Go to an addiction counselor? Get vivitrol (I don't really want to do this due to a horrible experience in the past that put me in the hospital for a week and bedridden for a month)? What else could I do? I personally do not think I need treatment; I have no issues getting clean on my own when I want to, but I am willing to do whatever will look best in court, even though all it's gonna do is make me think about dope MORE when I'm trying to do the opposite - forget about it and move on with my life like a normal person, which is what works for me. Is any of these things even likely to make a difference with the da/courts or would I just be wasting my time? I'm pretty salty about this whole situation if you couldn't tell.",1506546072.0

My friend on the other hand, came into a small amount of money and was posed with the option to pay the dboy back or get dope then to get subs the following day from someone else. OBV he decided to get the dope from someone else.

As it would turn out, the backup dboy couldn't get subs. My friend can't go to the guy he owes money to until pay day so he can't ask that guy for subs tho I believe I bought his last sub anyway.

Point is, if my friend maintained good will with his newest dboy, he probably would've been able to get him to at least get him to middle through someone else to get subs.

He'd quit a few days and the usual symptoms appear, vommiting, unable to eat and sleep, and cold...but whenever my mom suspects he's secretly using again the signs are he can sleep, eat, and not feel cold anymore...

He just stays inside and I can understand that because it would be difficult to go out, do things, or exercise while being in withdrawal...or am I wrong?

It's a drain on my mom and I and I get so frustrated some times but I never show it I just put on a supportive attitude. I'd be happier if in his weakest moment to smoke some weed maybe to help instead of using again...would that help at all?

He said na meetings are not for him and my mom and I are thinking maybe suggest going to rehab if we can scrap the money together somehow...I'm currently looking for work...so lost right now...

I started taking oxy 1,5 month ago, in the beginning i ""only"" took 4-5 40mg doses daily but my use quickly exploded since i had a big supply of it. I know i was very naive since i thought that the price i was going to pay would be small when i could just switch back to sub again - i was WRONG!

I posted a couple of days ago because i was afraid of taking my subutex too soon and getting PWD, so i waited 12 hours, but like several people mentioned this wasn't enough, at least i think wasn't. I was sick as fuck when i took the sub, and had already suffered in hell for 4-5 hours from the oxy WD. Oxy WD are the worst i have ever experienced, nothing compares for me.
Anyhow, i took 2mg nothing really happened i was still sick, then an hour later ingested another 2mg, but i became more and more sick, it was fucking horrible i was so goddamn sick that couldn't barely walk, i had mild hallucinations and all the other classic symptoms. I took more subs and ended taking 12mg - I still don't know if i had this PWD, or if it just were some kind of detox process. Because with the doses i had been taking until the oxy bupe switch were pretty huge. And i just feels like no doses of buprenorphine can't fully cover the WD from the oxy.

It is now day 3. I definately feel better, but still half sick. It's like a normal detox process with some parts missing, don't know if it makes sense but even though i have been taking 14mg sub this morning and 8mg this afternoon. I still feel that some kind of detox is going on. I'm sweating alot, and have some of the classic WD symtopms. Depression has been a nightmare as well but i beginning to become better and better.

My doctor told me that with the doses i had been taking, i would have suffered no matter what and she's expects that i'm 100% myself again within a couple days to a week.

I still have a bunch of oxy laying here, but even though i have been so sick i didn't even crave it. I can't control oxy, and tolerance is a huge problem for me. My time on subutex was much better. I was more stable and didn't chase any high all the time, so that's what i'm about to be again. Damn, even though i dont feel 100% well i still feel some kind of relief. The last couple of days has been a true nightmare. But it's like you're going to pay a price no matter what, even if you start on subutex. My doctor said that i ""should"" had been tappering down to a much lower amount of oxy and ketogan, but that would have been a pain in the ass as well.

One thing is for sure. I'm staying on subutex now and try to build a life up. When i'm stable at sub, i'm tappering down to a much lower amount - that's pretty easy in my experince.

Here's the scenario: 100 pills, first dissolve all the pills and shake for 5 minutes with 250ml of lukewarm water, cool to about 2c in the freezer, then filter. Save the liquid in the fridge, then take the ASA stuff and again was with 150ml of water repeating all the other steps. Do it again with 75ml, and repeat all the steps above.

So now I'm left with a theoretical 960mg of codeine phosphate (in reality it's about 90% of that but regardless) dissolved in 475ml of water. I've read on different forums that trying to boil of some of that water could degrade the product, so I'll put it in a water bath with stirring and keeping the solution below 45c.

So here's my question : instead of using a water bath technique could I just put it in a microwave until dry???

Would love to hear if someone else has tried the method, or if someone has succeeded with the method.

I was addicted to fentanyl for about half a year. Almost died from an overdose and then went through the worst withdrawal ever. A bit ago I got some heroin again and used for two days again. When I stopped I was sick as a dog again, really weird.

Anyways, I realized that I can't control opiates and stopped when I ran out again. I'm proud I didn't buy more. Now it has been 15 days and I am feeling great again! The depression, anxiety and RLS from the PAWS is gone and there are basically zero cravings. Of course, there is always that voice in your head saying ""Just buy more and use, you'll feel awesome"" but we all know the consequenses outweigh the short-lived high.

I'm rambling, sorry. I kind of quit all drugs together, because I don't have the money for them at the moment, but I plan on getting some weed and pregabalin in the near future again - those drugs have amazing highs too, even if they don't compare to heroin or fentanyl.

Anyways, just updating you guys, in case this gives someone motivation. Of course, a two day relapse is not that hard to defeat, but I am proud of myself. I could have very easily slipped into addiction again. I even thought about ordering fucking fentanyl analogues again, when I was sick.

Good luck quitting or happy nods, people!",1506691912.0
737ewh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/737ewh/switching_from_methadone_15mg_to_suboxone_would/,28,https://redd.it/737ewh,Bottlecap_buddy,"Switching from methadone (15mg) to suboxone, would love opinions?","Hi all,
So I’ve been on MMT for 3.5 years, and on a dose of 15mg for around 5 months. I’m switching to suboxone, with the hopes of taking it for 2-3 months as a way of getting of all maintenance drugs without months of w/d. I’ve started to get some gross side effects from the mmt (weight gain, brain fog, etc) and I’m sick of being tied to the clinic. I went to the new suboxone doc yesterday and he decided my dose of methadone was so low that I only needed to wait 24 hours between my last methadone dose and starting the subs. He wanted me to take 2 mg of the subs when I woke, then take more if the 2 didn’t do it for me. I was supposed to start this morning, but I panicked and took my methadone instead, I’m terrified of precipitated w/d. Does this sound right to anyone?

Relevant info: 
I don’t use any opiates besides the methadone and have been “clean” for 3.5 years. 
I take my methadone dose at around 4:30-5 am and it hold me until the next morning. I am in mild withdrawal when I wake up every morning though. 
I take Ativan daily for my anxiety and have a small emergency storage of xanax 
I have to continue working and going to school while doing all of this... honestly my biggest worry is getting through this switch without screwing up work or school. I don’t have anyway of getting any real time off from these things, although I do work from home (so I don’t have to look great, I just need to be able to think straight enough to work). 

I’ve tried to put all the relevant info in this post without writing a novel, but I might’ve forgotten something. Any advice, recommendations or personal stories would be so welcomed. I am scared out of my mind about this. 

*edit for update* I waited till the 36 hour mark, almost caved on just taking my methadone again, but decided to try a small amount of subs. Took 1mg about half an hour ago, with no real change one way or the other. Gonna give it another 30 mind and try another 1mg.

*edit II for update* At this point I’m updating for any future peoples that might need to desperately google while they're panicking about what to do. I just took another 1mg 20 minutes ago. I feel a bit better, less of that *smell* that comes with w/d (I hope someone knows what I mean), legs are a bit less achy, less goosebumps, significantly less anxiety (probably because I’m not terrified of putting myself through hell by dosing too soon more than anything else. Will continue to update. This feels like a travel journal now.

*edit III The Edit Returns* I’m at 1.5mg subs now and most of my w/d symptoms are gone, or at least better. I’m trying to stay under 2mg to make getting off the subs easier. I think at this point I’m mostly in the clear, just gotta deal with my body getting used to the ol’ switcheroo. I think I’ll stay at 1.5mg for tonight, then dose at 2mg in the morning as my maintenance dose.

After I'd been taking half a one a day, I got an emergency call from another friend who said 2 guys were in hospital from taking them. 
I knew they tasted wrong, so I threw them away, but it turns out they were the Fentynal batch, and after a quick search of Google, I saw they were the same pills that killed 9 during US Spring-break.

He also was the only one who I knew could get the pandas g 74s.


 However he said he would introduce me to his friend so I can get them for the same amount he got them for since he is trying to straighten up his life and didn’t want to be around it anymore.  His life has been spiraling down the last couple months and we all know the struggle. 


The reason though he said he would hook me up with his buddy is about a month ago he had a nasty infected abscess on his arm that he was about  to have to go to the er for but didn’t have health insurance. Luckily I had a full script of antibiotics that I never took from earlier this year and gave that to him and it helped it heal.

Unfortunately I never heard back from him since that day,I  figured he may had checked himself in rehab. Also i updated my phone recently and lost a bunch of contacts, his being one of them 

Today was pay day and I ended up grabbing about a few hundred bucks worth of blues  from a different guy for 30 a pop. That’s what they go for around my area.

 A few hours ago before I grabbed these blues I had several missed calls from a number I didn’t recognize and it wasn’t my friend’s number  cause I vaguely remember what his number looks like. I didn’t think much of it and forgot all about it until liiterally within 1 minute of grabbing the blues, my buddy finally  texted  me up asking if I received a few missed calls  earlier. 

He then precedes to tell me that the missed calls were from his guy and that he had  pandas and blues he wanted to hook me up for at  25 for the pandas  and blues for 10 a piece! 😑 

Since I had just spent the little money I could spend from this paycheck  and missed the guys call from a few hours earlier that ship had sailed. 

So basically I fucked myself over real bad and the timing couldn’t be anymore imperfectly perfect! And my buddy is a jack ass for not giving me a heads up anytime before his friend hit me up.

I hope what he wrote made sense as I’m nodding out from the over priced aut I got after finding out I could have had them at a third of the price and running on barely any sleep the last couple days. FML",1506658836.0

I'm 425 days clean from heroin and 365 days clean from suboxone today. I was fully dependent on opiates for 6 years of my life, using 1-2g's daily depending on the quality just to function. I tried to quit cold turkey two times by myself with a friend to watch me and make sure I was okay, first time I failed miserably, then a month later i tried it again and ended up having a seizure after 48 hours without using, friend ended up shotgunning me hits to try and pull me out of it and it worked thank God. He had a quarter g on hand for if the withdrawal process got dangerous, for example like if I couldn't drink water and became dangerously dehydrated (thinking back i probably could have just used IV fluids i guess). 

Neither of us expected a seizure though, we didn't even know that could happen from withdrawing. But i was also using meth every day, sometimes coke, and I would drink a few beers most nights. So i decided to check into a medical supervised detox clinic, ended up having a seizure there too. The nurse came to check my vitals and saw what was happening and I woke up in a hospital, that's what they told me because I don't remember any of it. So my doctor had to write me a script for suboxone because he decided it was too dangerous for me to go cold turkey. Started off on 16mg/day and tapered down over the course of two months to .25mg while attending NA meetings (legally required for people prescribed suboxone in my state) and then jumped off of that.

Quitting opiates was one of the most difficult things I've ever had to go through. This is coming from a victim of early childhood violent sexual abuse that went on for over a year, as well as someone who found their 17 year old sister dead hanging from the rafters in their garage, among other things, but I wont go into any more details and I apologize if that was TMI. My point to this is that it's incredibly difficult to get clean from a TRUE opiate dependency/addiction. Especially during the first year. You'll feel like you're stuck and you'll never be a ""normal"" person again. Hopelessness, despair, anger, sadness, regret. And fear, the fear and panic attacks are their worst during acute withdrawal, but they persist for a long time after that phase. 

But the human brain is an amazing thing, eventually neuroplasticity WILL start working its magic, and you'll start to get more energy, have an appetite, want to face the world again. Then you'll begin to be happy again, true happiness not artificial from dope. Your brain will rewire itself and before you know it you wont even think about dope anymore, and when you do it will probably make you feel disgusted if you're anything like me.

It is so hard to do. But with enough willpower, dedication and grit you can do it, I believe in you. I spent the last several years of my life stuck in a hell of my own making but I finally crawled my way out. If I can do this then I KNOW YOU CAN TOO!!! I love you all, and I wish you strength and fortitude in your journey.

I switched over from Oxy to H a few years ago. I go on binges with H. I just finished a week and a halfs worth, which for me is only 1 gram of ECP. I usually will call it quits from anywhere from 3-4 months, but I feel like picking up again within the next week or so. The thing is I really miss that feeling of Oxy! The last H I got had rave reviews being ""The most Fire #4 ECP EVER"". It was alright, but I still miss that Oxy itch that this dope didn't give me. 

My question is will I be wasting my money switching back to 30's because of the tolerance I'm used to with using H? Back in the day I was doing only 1 blue a day! 

Also for the past couple months my girlfriend has been giving me half of a 5.7 Zubsolv a night to help with my cravings which I stopped a few days prior to using H obviously, but I started on those again a couple days ago to help with my mild withdrawals.

I now remember why I hate cocaine. This coke was like exactly the same color as the quite white dope Ive been getting, so I see where my dboy made the mistake, but he WILL NOT own up to it. 

I cant believe this happened, I had already done a fat g of some really good boy, so I couldnt even really tell this was coke for the longest time, just that it felt...different. 

Once the H started to wear off I thought maybe it was H cut with some coke, so I kept snorting it. Yeah no, just STRAIGHT cocaine, as I discovered when I kept sniffing it and BUGGED THE FUCK OUT. I was getting overpowering waves of coke feeling (wouldnt call it euphoria cuz I HATE stimulants). I started to feel really sick and overstimulated, so I cut my boy off like 4 absolutely massive lined of it, so he could back me up that the dude sold us coke instead of H. 

OK here comes the super wack and ironic part: my friend is on Vivitrol but he still had crazy cravings and wanted to taste the H slash try and break through, so I went to cop for us.

 Since I did the deed, I got to pick which two of the 0.5g bags I wanted. Since 2 of them were rocks and 2 were powder and all were the same color, I of course picked the rocks which turned out to be straight coke, leaving my friend with the 2 bags of powder that was actually really good heroin that he couldnt feel because of the vivitrol!

If my greedy ass had just picked both or even one of the bags of powder, I wouldnt be geeking the fuck out and my friend who actually likes Coke could have caught a decent buzz. 

Like I said, I ended up giving him over a thrid of the bag for free because I hate this shit, but the moral of the story is don’t be greedy, Oxydragon!

OK lastly and most importantly, how do I mellow the fuck out? I havent done coke in years and years and I just did .6-.7 thinking it was H, so yeah Im feeling pretty fucking strange.

They're pretty damn entertaining, with one of the first stories being about one of the hosts barging into a vets office while barred out trying to find anything and ending up knocking a nurse over, stealing phenobarbital, and resisting arrest / assaulting the police outside.

He ended up buying about two balls from my dude and about a dozen bars, and all was well!  He would usually take the bars and pass out for HOURS, so when I didn't hear from him right away I didn't freak out at first.  Well, two nights ago, he asked me if my dude had 50 bars to sell and if he could put an order in.  I texted my dude and he usually doesn't readily have them, but can get them almost instantly.  The dude gives me a price and my neighbor agrees, so the wheels were put into motion.  I text my neighbor about an hour later to tell him to be ready at 10 the following morning and I will take him out there, and I don't get a response but it's no big deal.  The next morning I text him around 8 and say to he ready and that I will start blowing him up around 9 to wake him up.  My dude was going to pick them up around 9:30 but he ended up going to work and said he would do it at 2:30, which I said was cool considering sleeping beauty was still passed out.  Well, 2:30 comes and then the dude's dude is MIA, so we agree on 7:30, which again is fine because at this point, STILL no response.  I get home from work and my neighbor's car is still there and his blinds still drawn so I still assumed he was passed out.  I keep texting and calling, and then at 7:30 I knock on his door.  At this point, my dude was at his dude's house picking up the 50, which he paid $6 for per piece and was charging my neighbor only $7, because he was getting such a big amount.  I knocked on his door for about one minute and he finally answered!  I was so happy he answered, because I knew he was okay because obviously the thought of the worst entered my head and then told him we had to go asap to pick them up!  He then started mumbling something about how he is sick or who the hell knows and how he doesn't want them all now and then he doesn't have any cash on him... I kinda started tuning out and just heard ""blah, blah, blah""!  I explained to him that the dude has already got them and that I gave MY dude my word that he wouldn't back peddle, because he didn't want to be sitting on such a large amount.  I was just shocked!  He said tomorrow he will get 25 and mumbled again something else, at that point, I just didn't care.  Now, my neighbor DOES have money, so it's not like he's broke and can't afford it.  Now, what should I do?? My dude is mad because he is now sitting on them!  And, it's now 10 am and my neighbor hasn't hit me up yet and he assured me today would be the day!

Or you can keep telling yourself that you're just an addict and you have a disease and you cant quit. Find a med that works for wd , use it to taper, and quit. You don't have  a disease, you have an addictive personality. So you replace unhealthy addictions with healthy ones. Now instead of doing opiates, I exercise and fuck dime pieces for sport. So, tl;dr stop whining about your disease, suck it up, realize that your mind is more powerful than you thought and you are in control, and take back that control. Getting high is fun, and when you chip opiates can be awesome. When they become all consuming, it's time to reevaluate and make a change. All of you can do this. And you don't need suboxone/methadone handcuffs to do it. All you need is your mind and a little belief in yourself. And also.....MASK OFF MAGA NIGGAS!!!!",1506741360.0

My car just died today. The alternator went out last night. I had the battery tested this morning and it's good but its not getting anything from the alternator.

If I charged it with a charger, I can drive the car short distance but I have to charge it again. During the last drive, I started smelling something and when I stopped the fucking alternator was smoking.  I thought it was just hot but it kept smoking and then I heard crackling inside it and it was **on fire**! I put it out but now the electrical is all fucked up and it drains the battery as you watch the multimeter.

Obviously I have *no* money to fix something of this magnitude. I have another car which is **way** crappier but it needs a battery (side terminals or I'd use the van's battery). I think If I can get a batt for the second car I'll be ok.

Secondly, my daughter was just diagnosed with scoliosis. They had a screening at school and they flagged her for it. We scheduled an appt this morning at 10. The car shit the bed at fucking 9. I walked 3 miles home, in WD as I hadn't yet scored....(*couldn't* score as I didn't have a car anymore at that point) and managed to find someone to give us a ride to the doctors office. 

Did I mention that I dropped and broke my phone last night? That's just icing on the cake.

We're waiting on FEMA to inspect our house as we incurred some roof damage, and loss of wages due to hurricane IRMA but FEMA seems to be moving rather slowly right now. There might be some hope on the horizon but as of now I have no phone and no car.

I have no idea what we're going to do.

Despite having suboxone on hand all the time, the WDs have gotten worse and worse every week, and the consequences of my using have been piling up at my door - financial, friendships, life etc. 

There's nothing particularly special about this attempt at quitting apart from the culmination of the past few months of being in that contemplation phase of addiction. I know my life will be a lot better without putting a needle in my arm 4-5 times a day but it has been just too hard to approach all this time. 

Luckily I've only got 1 year of IV use to get over, 5 years of H in total, but a lifetime of ""other drug"" use to recover from. I've flitted in and out of 12-step programs but I dont find myself completely fitting with the message. Some parts of it are good but I can't get past the clich-iness of it and it feels like church.

I really gotta get past this needle fixation - i've been shooting my subs this week. So far its been difficult, but not as hard as i thought it would be. The constant urge to just fuck it all and try again later is something thats always gonna be there but im hanging on.

I get a 30mL 20mg/mL bottle of Morphine Sulphate, which contains no alcohol or sugars, so it's completely safe to IV. I use a wheel filter to filter the entire 30mL just in case though.

I've been shooting this stuff for years without any problems. I can even IM/SC without any risk of abscess. I love this stuff. Better rush than heroin in my opinion, mainly because of the amazing pins and needles effect from it. I truly love this stuff. 

Well, on my way back, it's about a 30 minute drive. One hour round trip. I had to stop at a truck stop to get gas on the way back. As soon as I pulled into the truck stop, a state trooper followed behind me and pulled up behind me where I was getting gas. I was worried, because here in Louisiana, they've been trying to crack down on drugs a lot lately. Not anything unusual, especially in Louisiana. 

The drug laws down here are insane. Truly fucking insane. Any possession of heroin is a minimum of 5 years. Even though it wasn't heroin, I still didn't feel like getting a charge. I didn't have any rigs on me, only the bottle of Morphine. So I put it in my pocket, go inside the truck stop, and grab an ICEE. I put the bottle in the bottom of the ICEE, and fill it up. I get my straw, go to the counter, pay for my gas and such and head on out. 

As I head out, the state trooper is eyeing me while I walk to my truck. I put my gas in and get in my truck. Drinking out of my ICEE to make it seem less suspicious. 

After leaving the truck stop, he follows me, and of course, I get fucking pulled over. He comes up my window, tries to open my door. I unlock it, and he opens it, un-buckles my seat belt, and fucking pulls me by my belt loops out of my seat, throws me in handcuffs, and puts me in the back of his big ass SUV. I keep asking him what the fuck did I do, he's not answering me.

Cops down here are corrupt as fuck. They do what they want and get away with it. He's searching my truck, and fucking goes crazy and literally looks through all my shit for what felt like an hour. I was going crazy. I thought I was going to jail. I saw he set my ICEE on top of my truck while he was looking through everything else. 

Time passed, and he came back, and said I'm good to go. I asked why he did what he did, and he said shut the fuck up. I did just that. Went back to my truck, keys were still in the ignition, grabbed my ICEE from the roof of my vehicle, and set it back in the cup holder. 

God, he fucking ripped everything out of every crevice and threw shit wildly. Not giving a single fuck. But I didn't care, I was just ready to get home. I head back to my house. Get my morphine, and take a 5mL luer lock syringe. I get my IV port kit, and set it up. Quickly push 100mg of morphine into my port, and god fucking damn. My whole body feels like my foot fell asleep, but all over. 

Great rush. 10/10 would recommend. I also have access to vials of Hydromorphone, 100mg/mL, 10mL vials. I pay $40 for 1.5mL. Lovely price. Mixing the morphine, with Dilaudid & coke, talk about the best rush you could ever imagine in your entire life. I don't think theres anything better in the world. Maybe, but I haven't found anything that comes close. Also mixing a vial of Ativan with the shot really helps the coke not make me feel like I'm dying at times. I don't really shoot coke anymore because it's fucked up all my veins. I mainly use the IV port kits that I buy from a few different websites, which save my veins. Also mixing the Morphine and Dilaudid with saline seems to help my veins a LOT.

Sorry for the ramble. High doses of IV morphine make me talk so fucking much it's insane. Not as much as meth, but I fucking hate meth.

OK, I'll stop rambling. I'm just happy I'm not in jail. 

Thank you, Junkie Jesus. But most importantly, thank you, my sweet cola ICEE. You've made my day a lot better. 

Love you guys. Hopefully all of you are as high as I am right now. 

One more thing, shout out to my fucking corrupt hospice nurse who has given me access to things people dream of. With great prices, always on time. I don't mind making the 30 minute drive, not a problem at all. I wish all of you could get this shit. It's TOO fucking good. ",1506722577.0

Any advice? It seems cold copping isn't working out too well. I know I can probably do DNM but it's hard to do with my current situation. Thanks!,1506705378.0

I've been waiting for about two months to have the stars align and for me to have the money/opportunity/all the paraphernalia required for me to go cop again. I had every thing planned and yesterday was able to get a bunch of new rigs then went and copped about 2.5g's (#3 powder). I came home set up a shot, did it and didn't feel much. So I did another and still wasn't feeling enough. I did another shot and started cleaning all of my mess up; all the trash and empty alcohol wipe packets into the toilet. After everything was cleaned I realized I had just flushed the heroin with the trash. So disappointing I can't begin to explain.",1506704729.0

This happens no matter how gently I snort, or which nostril I use. I’ve noticed that I feel a lot less of the drug because of this.
And tips or ideas sniffers?",1506701734.0
