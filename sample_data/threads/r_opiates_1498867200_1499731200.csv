just a tiny bit @ .8 but man it's the strongest gear I've had for months, it's mad cause yesterday i walked 6 mile for my partner and i and the gear was only so-so, 

today was my partners' turn to do the walking for the same amount, took about the .3-4 (that's missing from the pic, cause in arm) and WOW it blew my socks off, 

what a beauty of a rush, it shook me to my toes and my heart was beating out of my chest, a full minute rushing like a bastard, granted it's my third hit today but the other 2 were from weaker gear that was a creeper anyway, 

just felt i had to get that out as it really was such a fucking noteworthy room spinning, jelly legged rush and where better than r/opiates? nowhere imo and ime is better than this sub, a good whack of the users are diamonds, there is not so much arrogance here and people are generally less judgmental.

My state doesn't have any exchanges and you can't get needles at the pharmacy. I used to go to the pet store and get 100 count boxes of doggy insulin needles. (Not cheap when you're strung out) I would give fresh rigs to my friends because using a needle until it's basically broke is common around here. It's sad that the only choices here are basically the pet store or online. There are a few small pharmacies that go ahead and give needles without a script but I think they are doing it illegally. It's always the smaller pharmacies. One of them had a son who died from AIDS about 20 years ago so he does it for his son. I don't know if he's still able to do it. I've been clean for a while so there may be no pharmacies left in my area that do it. It just makes me really sad and even though I am clean harm reduction is still really important to me. There are still people I care about that use and I want them to have access to good clean supplies and narcan!

Let me start off by saying in general I have a poor self image and super self conscious and I've always struggled to orgasm. Always always always. 
UNTIL THIS AMAZING NIGHT COMES ALONG. It's only my second time snorting dope, the first also being a great experience. Normally I can't cum when I'm having sex and I can't make myself orgasm either. Well tonight after getting home I go to the bathroom to wash my face and instead end up masturbating on the toilet seat and I came not once, BUT FIVE SOLID TIMES IN A ROW! All orgasms accompanied by squirting atleast a liters worth total of womanly essence. It's been over 3 years since I last came and I'm so excited I've learned how to unlock this sweet release! 
I'm also extra excited because my understanding of opiates is that in general they decrease your want for sex and makes it harder to, well, get hard. That's definitely the case with my boyfriend (Didn't even look interested or happy for me when I told him what I just did). 

Has anyone else had a positive sex experience like me? Is it more common than it seems or am I just a lucky exception? I'd love to hear about others' experiences! ",1498903798.0

The people are adament I go to Ashford online where they go, they insist it's easier to get setup, get your money back, and it's quality education. I take issue with that bc the classes are done in a message board setting almost and I can read other people's work and it's a little off putting that mofos 3+ years in can't spell and all that. I get it tho, prob older working people just doing the bare minimum. Anyways it's like 12k a year. That seems high too.

I'm 28 and went to ""normal state univ"" out of HS but I was balls deep in using so that only lasted a year. I still read a lot (off and on) and do school for my people so I'm not totally brain dead...anyways where I'm going with this is I want to learn to code, maybe some type of IT management gig but if I could work remotely ergmahgawd. Im not sure where to begin. I originally was in school for business management but I'm worried online bus degree won't get me far. From what ive read on coding a degree isn't even necessary. Ashford doesn't do any programming just a gen IT degree.

Anyway. I'll hit a month clean Thurs. And we got new jobs we start Monday since the first place kinda fucked us. Hope everyone is okay and being safe. Neither me or my girl are comfortable in our own skin. We hate what we've done to our lives, we don't have a pot to piss in.

And I really miss that, but I know he's okay now. But seeing everyone else's pets makes me happy in his absence.

I've lurked here for a long time but didn't ever feel the need to post until now and you're the only group of people that I can tell this too.

Me and my best mate Will met in 5th grade when we spent a summer playing mario kart and eating cheese balls. We rolled our first joint on the curb of his cul de sac in 9th grade and spent the next 4 hours reliving our 5th grade summer. We were in the game together from day 1. We went to college and were roommates in the dorms. We pooled our money and drove his moms old corolla to pick up together every day that year. That car had the faint smell of McDonalds all the time. Will was a skinny dude but he loved his big macs.

When we were getting dope sick he was the one friend I could count on that wouldn't burn me for a bag. If we were sick we were sick together and we pulled through together. He was the mastermind behind every hustle I wouldn't make it far without him. 

He od'd and hes gone. I wrote a half assed speech for his funeral because I couldn't put any true memories into it. Our families didn't know and I didn't want to tell them Will was a good guy because he shared his rigs when I was out. I couldn't tell them that Will was smart because he made picking up easier when he brought mtg cards and we played the hours we're sometimes kept waiting.

What's am I to do when grieving? Every time I do anything associated with getting right I think of the absence of his presence. I think of my family grilling me on drug use because my best friend overdosed, how much harder it is to hide when I need to the most. 

You've all been through this I know because I've lurked here for long enough to see it, but I haven't lost anyone before. The risk of death was there and we knew it but it was an abstract risk I didn't think about. If I died lights out and I'm gone but I didn't think I would lose a friend. I never thought my other friends in our group would blame me and Will for not sticking to the socially acceptable weekend partying. I never thought I'd feel so isolated and in a spot light at the same time. I want to relive the days of playing mtg in a mcdonalds corolla. When we set up mario kart in our dorm room we were talking about setting it up in our own houses one day. We graduated in middle school together, and in high school, and we were going to graduate college together. His mom had a frame with 3 slots for the pictures of us doing the same stupid pose in front of the school after the ceremonies. The third slot was supposed to be full next year and it won't be. I think about those little things and I can't keep thinking about them anymore. ",1498878085.0

She wanted to express her endless love for me and ask me how I felt. It had escaped my attention in the past, that when we do talk, just how often she would ask how I’m doing or how I'm feeling, each one swept away with a “fine” or “I’m okay”. I can't say what it was, she may have asked an extra couple of times, but damn it if the words didn't get heavy when I tried to respond, stumbling through the “fines” and getting the “goods” stuck in my throat, my voice starting to quiver at the heft of the lie in my reply.

Somehow I was able to get out the last “OK” and even say goodbye with halfway to an even tone – and like a bag bursting open from the weight inside, I ran into the bathroom and cried. Where I was raised, the neighborhood I was brought up in – once you're a child, you don't cry. To cry is to admit defeat. To cry is to lose.

When I was about seven years old some kids from the neighborhood had gathered in a field of unripened crab apple trees. The older kids were getting situated for a battle, kind of like a snow ball fight, but using crab apples since it was Latin America. When one of the older kids noticed that I intended on joining them he warned my brother that I was out of my league and that I should sit this out:

“If you let him play he’s going to cry. I’m telling you, he's too young.” He wanted to spare me a loss.

One of the kids from my grade overheard him saying this and immediately interjected on my behalf:
 
“That's impossible! Leon never cries!”

I've long considered it to be the greatest compliment anyone had ever paid me, then and for years thereafter. When victories were hard to come by, his voice and those words would be my pillow of rocks . I was the man that never hurt. I convinced myself of this and made it so. 

She took mercy on me and let me hang up, sparing me my precious pride. She knew. I sat in the bathroom and cried. I bawled like before I was a child. I cried because I had failed her and her inexhaustible golden light. I wanted to give her a victory over my Father. I wanted to validate her hope that her love could erase everything he filled us with as kids, my brother and I, the sludge and the tar. 

I cried because she would know her love hadn't won. I cried because I was becoming like him. I'd find myself acting like him and my heart would begin to race. I'd look down at my hands and see the growing, gnarly claws. I'd act weak, like he was weak, and feel the fangs as I ran my tongue across my teeth.

I sat up from the floor. I wiped my tears. I washed my face. I looked up at the mirror and I felt strong. I felt strong like I would in my childhood over swallowed tears. I looked at the mirror and I didn’t see a monster. I liked what I saw. I walked away from the mirror, stronger still. The tears were gone. I turned off the light, and spoke with an even tone: “You’re the last werewolf in this family you son of a bitch.”",1498871987.0

I've been taking 5mg and 10mg Percocets for a few years, usually around 20mg per day split up. I always had the euphoric feeling.

Recently I switched to OC40's because of concern with taking long term doses of acetaminophen and damage to liver.

The problem is when I cut the OC40's up and take them (I chew them up really good and then swallow with water). They have a very bitter taste to them. I don't get much of a warm and happy euphoric feeling. I also get EXTREMELY tired. So tired I can barely keep my eyes open. I've also gotten a really bad headache a few times. 

When I tried going back to the Percocets they have almost zero effect, like I built up a huge tolerance suddenly. 

Not sure what's up. The vendor is legitimate and  they test their stuff and the pills don't look fake. Everything else I've gotten from them is legit. 

Is it normal for OC to make you this tired? And the euphoria is nowhere near that of the percocets I've taken. It almost feels like I'm taking a powerful muscle relaxer that knocks me out. Not sure what's up because I hear everyone else talking about how amazing they are.

I've been taking 10mg (then 20mg doses when I didn't feel much).

Many find these therapies inadequate and continue to use on top. I, myself, spent 8 months on methadone (80mg/day) and three on suboxone (12mg/day) but could not stop continued use of actual heroin or other drugs, though it did decrease dramatically. These therapies are imperfect imo because they do not adequately recreate what it is I am looking for. I have long thought and read about actual heroin maintenance therapy and it seems that when done correctly (i.e. high and frequent enough dosing) it has the desired effects of reducing crime, reducing illness, increasing employability, etc. Obviously there is a counseling component to this therapy and many find they eventually need less of the drug and can even wean some with time. This has been successfully implemented in several countries, like the Netherlands and Germany. [Here](http://www.alternet.org/drugs/canada-will-allow-prescription-heroin) is an article about a trial in Canada and [here](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0810635)  is one comparing methadone with diacetylmorphine maintenance.

I kinda remember enjoying it but not in the way you enjoy heroin or morphine, it was fun but I can see the comparison to it being the crack of opiates, constant and dangerous redosing.

I've found some online, 1 gram for about 90$ after shipping and handling. I can get a gram of black tar for about 75$ but would either require me to travel a few hundred miles or trust snail mail to deliver the goods.

My major problem is I am probation and can be drug tested any time. I can usually predict with low margin of error when I'll be tested but random ones are always possible, hence my considering u44. 

Last time I did it I plugged it, this time I have syringes readily available and was debating i.v use of it, but have heard mixed results.

I know it's dangerous, possibly more dangerous than heroin but in my mind it it is less dangerous than a fent analog. A happy middle ground I suppose.

6kipvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6kipvg/otc_codeine_extraction_tek_no_caffeineno_solvents/,1,https://redd.it/6kipvg,robpot891,OTC Codeine Extraction TEK - No Caffeine/No Solvents,"Some countries sell OTC codeine which is usually ~ 350 mg APAP or Aspirin combined with 8-12mg codeine phosphate. Unfortunately in Canada, the pills include 15mg of caffeine as an abuse deterrent and traditional cold water extractions only remove the aspirin or apap and leave massive doses of caffeine still in the solution. If you're consuming 50 pills at once for 400mg of codeine, you're also getting 750mg of caffeine in one shot which is unpleasant to say the least.

The only technique I've seen to remove the caffeine is to use solvents like acetone or DCM. Obtaining pure versions of these solvents is hard enough, but then there's the added danger of not following proper procedures and killing yourself with noxious gases, explosions/fires or just straight up poisoning yourself. I have devised a new technique that removes everything but the codeine phosphate and requires no chemicals or special equipment.

Items needed:

ASPIRIN based codeine pills. The pills MUST contain aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). This tek does not work with tylenol (acetaminophen).

30cc-60cc oral syringe. The bigger the better. I use a 65cc oil mixing syringe.

Small unit measuring cup - shotglass also works but you need to mark the 10ml point.

Technique:

Grind up your desired amount of pills into fine dust. Use a blender to make it much quicker. I use 50 pills (400mg codeine) in my syringe. This is why using a big syringe is better because you can do large doses in one syringe.

Fold up paper towel into a square and soak it with cold water and push it to the bottom of the syringe to form a plug. This acts as a filter.

Pour the pill powder into the syringe slowly and when it's all in there, tap it against a table to settle the powder and make it more solid. You don't need to compact it into a rock but make sure it's solid enough and the top is flat and straight.

Measure 15ml of cold water and pour it down the sides of the syringe so it rests on top of the pill powder. The water needs to be cold for reasons I will explain later.

Insert plunger and gently press down and watch the water slowly seep through the powder. Take your time with this. It should take 1-2 minutes for the water to evenly seep to the bottom.

Catch the drops that come out of the syringe in a small measuring cup or a shot glass. You want 10ml of solution so if you're using a shot glass then measure and mark where 10ml is.

Once you have 10ml of solution in the cup, you can discard the pill sludge (or save it to do an acetone wash on it later). This 10ml of water will have approx. 80% of your codeine if you were patient, and a ton of caffeine due to caffeine's high water solubility.

Put the cup with the 10ml of water into the fridge. While the solution is cooling, caffeine will start to precipitate out of the solution as the temp drops. It looks like white cotton candy.

While solution cools, take your syringe that is now empty and put a new pre-soaked filter in the bottom just like before and place it in the fridge. You want the syringe and filter to be cold.

After 30-60 minutes, the solution will look like a clump of white cotton candy. This is all the caffeine that precipitated out of the solution due to the cold temperature. Place the cold syringe in a cup and scoop out the white sludge from the solution cup into the syringe. Make sure to get every last drop and do this quickly so everything stays cold. I do this while it's still in the fridge.

The water will have quickly seeped through the filter into the cup and the caffeine sludge will be sitting on top of the filter. Press the plunger down to squeeze the water from the caffiene crystals through the filter and into the cup.
What remains is 10ml of water with all your codeine and roughly 60-80mg of caffeine if you did it right. A huge reduction from the 750mg and barely noticeable (especially when the codeine kicks in).

The filter will have all the caffeine crystals stuck to it and a good way to measure your success is to see how much of the caffeine is still in the filter. Keeping the temperatures cold throughout the process will determine your success.

The codeine solution will taste absolutely disgusting so drink it down with a fatty drink like milk. Fat increases the absorption of codeine.

This whole process takes less than an hour and is very easy. People are crazy to do regular CWE and drink all that caffeine. This method only works with aspirin because acetaminophen clogs up the syringe and doesn't let water pass though.

I wake up everyday and I cry. I never used to cry; I used to just wake up and face the day. There was no time to think while I was using. Any pain or anger or sadness was quickly silenced by a call to my dealer. And it wasn't just the drug. It was the survival. I couldn't afford to cry unless it was in front of the cops or some mooch I was conning. But now I cry. I cry a lot and I don't know where it comes from. But I am sad and I am lonely, and I'm afraid that this feeling will never go away. I'm trying to stay strong but perhaps what all those NA bastards say is true. Perhaps I am weak and I was never strong.  I just wish it wasn't so emotionally draining to live in my own head. I am so tired all the time. All the things I've done, that I can't take back and that fucking [Cher song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsKbwR7WXN4) on repeat in the back of my mind. The drugs are gone...mostly. But the pain continues. 

Seriously tho. Drugs are a motherfucker on the developing mind. Children, don't do drugs...think about your limbic system.

I hit up bartard and he has apparently ghosted me. Well, damn he was good for a hookup when I only had $5 or $10. Kinda salty not gonna lie. 

That's it, I caved and hit up my mom's old main from like 5 years ago. I don't like him, he tries I won't lie but man he fucked me over hardcore years ago before I even did drugs and that's always stuck with me. Cost me $50 when I was broke, hungry, and homeless.

If i get prescribed some or a family member I will take a few, I really enjoy the stress relief it provides me. (I have been on numerous different anti anxiety/ depression medications) 

I personally don't think  I have a very addictive personality, alcohol, tried weed before, nothing seems to really grab me.  
Anyways,  Last month I got my hands on 80 hydrocodone 7.5 pills.
I was having a lot of fun taking usually one mid day and one in the evening.  Sometimes more. Sometimes less.   
I started to get a little nervous when the bottle was getting low so on the last two days i just took one at night.   The next few weeks i didn't feel anything.  No dependency or withdrawal symptoms that i noticed anyways.  
So my question is this,  How long would it take someone on this low of a dose to get ""hooked"" per say?  Or if this is a decent dose than perhaps i just have a tolerance?   
My apologies for what may be a very naive post, this is all fairly new to me and I have no friends that do any type of drug.

I was expecting to get paid yesterday, I am a contractor and I usually get paid every second thursday, but sometimes I don't get it until Friday. I'm a dope fiend so obviously it's been like a week since I have had any significant funds so I'm hurting pretty bad right now. I get paid via interact e-transfer btw.

So at about 10am today when I didn't get the transfer email yet I went to ask my boss if he got my invoices yet. He tells me some story that he thought I sent them on wednesday even though I sent them on Monday and that he wasn't going to get to them till Tuesday (Monday is a holiday). So I was like WTF and told him that I need to get paid today for rent and shit. He said he would try to get to it today.

So now it is 12:30 and I see him in the lunch room and ask him if he approved my invoices and he says yes... So now I'm just waiting on payroll to get to it and transfer me my money... every second is like an hour... God I hate waiting...

When I shot up my half, everything was fine at first. I felt as one normally does after shooting a fairly large amount (0.5 grams, as mentioned above). However, when I started walking towards the kitchen to grab a paper towel to wipe up the blood from the injection site something odd happened. I almost fell to the floor, as my entire body and brain seemed to ***entirely shut off*** for just a *split second*.    

It happened so quickly that I was able to prevent myself from falling on the ground. ***Every*** part of my body seemed to cease to function. For that split second, I couldn't hear, feel, see, taste, or smell. But just as quickly as this total lack of brain & body function came about, it went away. I don't really know how to explain what it felt like, other than by saying that I couldn't feel anything for that *very* short period of time.     

So, does any one have any idea as to why it seemed like after the shot, my entire body and brain seemed to completely ""shut off"" for like, half a second? I'm *very* sorry if this is what one might consider a shit post, but Google and reddit searches on the matter were inconclusive.

I completely forgot about this prozac shit, and this morning, I attempted to inject this. In the needle, the solution was opaque. Like it was the color of skim milk and it was thick and slippery and caustic. And then I just injected that anyway, and like 30 seconds after, I feel this pressure kind of underneath my cheek bones, and then my heart starts pounding at the end of each exhale, I felt this tightness at my chest. So I think I probably fucked up my heart valves with that probably water insoluble mixture. This was 6am. It's 1:50 right now, and to make matters worse, I just drank 250 mg of dxm because I forgot about that prozac so now I risk serotonin syndrome.

Went to my hometown always filled my mixed feelings. My best friend who has my favorite crystal dodged me but My roommate and I went to a friends house and smoked and watched Naruto. 

My room mate (let's call him Joe) is 5 months clean off opiates but takes 10mg of methadone a day and 1mg of Xanax a day which isn't even his but his mothers. He was recently diagnosed with degenerative disc disease but was given nothing but naproxen for it. 

Anyway, him and I are guided to mow this large lawn by friend's (Felita [its a guy but we call him that) dad Jerry. 

I make 40$ and buy food a single beer on the ride home and an eighth of bud of decent quality for $25 and have $5 left.

Hopefully I don't remember telling Joe I had $5 left because weed man suddenly revealed he had diesel ... What?!?

Divine fuckery. The kicker is I saw my most recent partner in crime today and saw he looked good (despite still using) and had a new job and non-using gf and just went to Electric Forest. 

So I wait half a beer, a few chicken nuggets, two blunts and a cigarette later plus 40 minutes to see said cool guy supreme pull up after dropping off the left-side neighborhood crack dealer ... LOL. I've been in this town for (have to think real hard cu I'm high) 4 months and just by observing I've learned its shittier than my hometown.

I was outside smoking a cig as I waited and seeing him pull up as I waited across the street drove a deep insecurity within me.. Saw him walk inside .. Then finally he sends his bro with the bag for me. I had $5 and owe him $10. Fuck yeah.

A single ECP Green McDonalds stamp lol I cut it halfway with scissors and just kind mushed the powder. Raised the scissor and sniiiifed. Then again with the other nostril. I'm in love with y'all attitudes so I'm spending my singular momentum of a rush of good H before I nod telling you relapsing and breaking my 3 months may have even worth it. I have most of a bag left. My neighbor has dope. And my room mate can't know.

I only worked today since like January besides Joe's dads shop in said hometown but I never get paid there lol. Is it worth telling Joe I broke my relapse even though I know he'll be disappointed? And maybe angry? Wouldn't kick me out bc he loves me like a true brother but said friend who went to E Forest gets to hear about how excited I am to find a fuckin bag after fantasizing lmfaoo. It's such a dualistic experience.

I have bud and a bag and some tobacco.. I like smoking out of a pipe with my tobacco... It's kind of gross but I'm especially afraid to do that now that I'm slushed.. Sloshed.. Lol even my gait became Shaggy-like lol groovy man.

Now rick was a small time dealer who I met when I was 14 and ended up dating for about a year. If I'm being honest, I ended up cheating on him (in my defence I owned up to the next day) so things didn't end on a great note to say the least. 

3 years later, while in a relationship, rick decides he wants a lil something on the side.  How do I know this? Because, one night he showed up at my house unannounced (lol) (not my finest moments tbh/I regret letting him in) and makes some moves thinking I'm dtf (I was) My only though after he left was ""if he just cheated on his girlfriend with me I'm sure he cheated on me with another bitch! That fucker! "" 

Fast forward to now. My sisters boyfriend/baby daddy (let's call him sal) just happens to be the towns plug. One day I'm kicking it and rick walks into my garage. My facial expression must have been fucked because he tells me he's just there to see sal. Whatever, right? I went into the house and shrugged it off. 

Due to the circumstances I see him a lot. He hits on me and offers to get me high but i expressed to him that I'm trying to turn my life around.

 There was a time I liked being around rick, I loved the drugs, I loved the thrill, I loved the sex and seduction. The whole lifestyle, at one point, was something I was into. That's not me anymore and I don't think he understands that

Anyways, I'm salty as fuck about the situation. And I think the point I'm trying to make is that the decisions you make in life can bite you in the ass and make things worse faster than you can say fuck off. 

TL;DR Due to shitty choices & circumstances  I now have to deal with the consequences - and I'm salty af about it.

My mans brother had 16 months clean and he overdosed and died last October. I've been with my man for 7 years now. His family is my family (I don't have family - just my brother). He's upstate but I still go to family functions and just chill at his parents house after school sometimes.

I feel guilty - Why did he have to die? I should be dead, but I'm not. I was really close with his brother. Sometimes I think his parents (his dad mostly) have like, FUCK I can't think of the word, I'm so fucking stupid now. Jesus fuck. Like I feel his parents look at me and think why isn't she dead? 

I fucking wish I was dead. Everything is so fucked up. Honestly, I think I was happier when I was using. Being sick and the shit I did sucked, but being high fixed it. It fixed fucking everything. I'm so fucking, I don't know, bored? I have zero friends.

Really interesting stuff, goes into the ethical debate regarding chronic pain and letting people potentially suffer versus contributing to the ""opiate epidemic"". Like, fuck the drug war for sure, and it would be awful to allow anyone to suffer just bc of people like us who make poor choices. But man it's crazy seeing the scripts they'd give back in the day.

Anyhow, there's a bunch of talk of Dilaudid in the film - not in detail, just examples of patients who are prescribed it long term. But that confuses me. Dilaudid has awful oral bioavailability, no?

6l0ar9,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6l0ar9/addiction/,10,https://redd.it/6l0ar9,monkeymodsa,Addiction,"Hi there.
I've been on prescription painkillers for a few years, originally because of some nerve pains. My background is a bit... unique. My father is a very famous musician and I have some mental issues. But I've never done recreational drugs... or never done took my meds for fun (beyond the first test that is). They ARE fun but that's a byproduct to me. I've been on codeine and fentanyl. Liquor makes me tired and weed makes me paranoid!

My mental issues are really mild but they prevent me from working a regular job and my situation enables me to not grow... or dis-enables me? I guess? I say this because it might explain why the following happened to me, in that I don't have background anxiety or depression and spend a lot of time self-caring already.

Recently I ran out of my painkillers because I forgot about them and went on vacation. But something weird happened. Our place didn't have a good internet connection and I was worried about what would happen to me so rather than being able to google withdrawal symptoms I had to rely on what I thought I knew about them. I prepared for the worst. But then nothing happened.

My skin tingled and I was restless for 1 night. After that my body couldn't settle on being hot or cold but I was fine mentally. I started to feel a bit sharper after a week and eventually the skin stuff settled down. So I got to wondering... does everyone get addiction?

A friend used to smoke heavily but stopped one day, he gained a few pounds but said he didn't feel the urge to have any more cigarettes. So I just kept reminding myself of that until I could speak to this guy again. I have since and he told me he wasn't craving cigarettes when he stopped, just as I didn't crave opiates. Now it's like I know there are physical symptoms because your body has been used to this drug... what I'm more interested in is the psychological side of it. Is this common maybe? 

One of my worries was people talking about addiction being a disease you're labored with forever. THAT gave me anxiety way worse than the painkillers in that I feared I'd never be free of this.

So for the majority of my childhood I lived with my broke ass mom and stepdad. I got really good at shoplifting as a child. Clothes mostly, but also yummy treats I otherwise would have never got. I worked construction with my stepdad, which I utterly despised. To this day I hate work, and am likely the laziest mother fucker you would ever meet haha. By the time I was a teenager I realized that selling pot and other shit like ritalin was a VERY easy way to make money with essentially no work. 

At this point in my life I was into wrestling, boxing, and occasionally float around other martial arts gyms. I wasn't into the Bud so much as the Ritalin. Fuck I always used to feel like such a hardass! When I reached highschool I was already an absolute menace. I used to make people give me money even if they didnt want pot or pills. Thats not to say it always worked lmfao! I got my ass handed to me about as much as I handed out ass whoopings. 

Eventually, things with my Stepdad got really bad. My mom let me talk to my biological father, which made my stepdad really butthurt. He took the door off of my bedroom (never really figured out that punishment to this day lmfao), took everything away from me but an ATLAS and a fucking HISTORY TEXTBOOK. I swear to god to this day I can tell you where any country is, and the complexities surrounding Napoleon's rise to power after the reign of terror. He even used to make me wait for the entire family to finish eating before I could come grab a plate and bring it back to my bedroom. I literally was put into solitary confinement with no privacy, and no way to ask anyone for help as he had the family pretty much under his thumb by that point. He even would take the cell phones my biological father bought me so I couldn't communicate. 

So around the time I would enter 10th grade I decided 14 months of hell was enough. I told him I was walking out the door and that if he tried to stop me I'd ""fuck him up"". He did try to stop me, and I did fuck him up. I had a buddy (best pot customer) pick me up down the road and I had an awesome weekend of partying and getting fucked up. Then the cops found me. 

I was able to pawn my backpack full of drugs on somebody else, and went to juvy my first time for Felony Battery, Domestic Violence by Strangulation (choke hold mferrr), and Assault w/ a Deadly Weapon (i like to pull knives n shit even after i win... i know... i dont fight much anymore lmfao i was a kid). 

After getting out me and him physically fought god I don't know how many more times. We even went through the drywall one time! Fucking crazy shit. Eventually they told me I was moving out too live with the biological father I never met. They gave me one single days notice about it too. So I had a heartfelt, but extremely short, good bye with my friends and siblings and said goodbye. I left all my drugs with my younger brother, and he never snitched so that was cool lmfao. 

What I didn't know though!! Was that although my biological Dad was much better off financially, he was an ex-con who was a LT in a very notorious prison gang I won't bother mentioning (we're white). Me and him fought too, A LOT, but I don't think to this day I could ever even get close to whooping his ass. I used to have to pull knives just to get a chance to run away lmfao. 

After moving in with my Dad I decided fuck the rules, and fuck the law! I turned into such a scumbaggy wanna-be gangster teenager that I'm sure today a conversation with my 11th grade self would make me absolutely **cringe**. 

This new town though came with new hook ups. Now instead of pushing pot and ritalin, I decided it made better economical sense to start pushing some bomb ass Ecstasy pills (to this day I get all tingly when somebody puts on some Deadmau5), and all the pain pills I stole from my dad.

For the longest time though I didn't use the pills, and only rolled on the E maybe once every month or so. I had this idea in my head that I was better than those junkies and dirt bags who would blow my phone up for six hours wanting an Op. Fuck I made so much money. Honestly as a junior and senior in highschool I had more money on me at any given time than I do now as an adult working full time. 

One of my good friends (at the time) let me in on his bomb ass Tar hook up. I tried it one time just to see what he kept fussing about and FUCK! I melted into the couch I was in and suddenly I wasn't so irritated. At 15 years old I thought I was the first person in the world to figure out that Heroin makes every other issue vanish. 

For the next half of my Junior year in highschool, and well into senior year I was fucking high as a kite. I legit just stopped going to school, and received two report cards of straight Failures. My dad would kick my ass EVERY DAY, but I didn't care. I knew I could just get high later. I walked around with black eyes, and crazy injuries all the time. But at this point the only *friends* I had where the people buying shit from me. Nobody else would talk to me, and to be honest I wouldn't have had it any other way. 

I actually quit Heroin that first time on my own a little before graduating (from my fourth highschool lmfao, been kicked out of one every year). That was when I first really got into smoking pot.

I was sketched out because another time I tried to buy offline this dude did a little switchers on me and ended up selling me fucking soda rock candy (it was dark, I was sick, didn't notice till I walked inside [i was PISSED]). Anyway my main started going out of town more and more to the point I would only get to buy from him once or twice a week, and if I didn't have money for a week or more worth of dope, I was basically screwed. Switched over to new homie and he matched what my old dude was doing for me. Idk what the point of this is but shit i feel spoiled. 

Oh also not to forget the fact he gave me a sack that I really wasn't feeling. I gave him a heads up to just let him know like ""hey, I don't know if you've tried this, but it's definitely not as good as what you usually get.""

First night back my friend mentioned something that her boyfriend said ""he's such a nice guy I just wish he wasn't into that bad shit."" My friend said she didn't think he was talking about pot but I just brushed it off.

Tonight we had a family dinner with my parents, grandpa aren't sand family friends. I met his new girlfriend for the first time. my parents just found out about her a few weeks ago. He just moved her and her child into his house. Immediately this girl didn't sit right with me she just looked ""rough."" But tried to keep an open mind.

About an hour after she has been there, right after we eat she goes out to her car for about 10 mins and then immediately to the couch and passes out HARD. My dads friend jokes about it seems like she just did heroin... half serious half joking. She then doesn't move for 3 hours, she barely even knows my parents they've only met her one other time. My brother is begging for her to get up to leave to go home and she is not wanting to and fighting him, very irritable.

As my brothers pulling her up I motion for my parents to watch and tell them it's drugs. My moms was in a bit of denial not wanting to have the conversation. She just kept saying how do you know.

After everyone left I called my friend that mention something to me earlier and she said that her sister was just been asking about my brother tonight saying she heard my brother is on drugs and it's really bad from someone who used to have a really bad meth addiction.

I leave on Tuesday and am trying to figure how to best help my brother. I've texted one of his friends who he hasn't been hanging around but I would guess knows the extent of things. I also plan on getting the guy with the former meth addiction whom I know to tell me what's going on/ give me advice on how to approach my brother.

After I talk to his friends I plan on telling my parents what's going on. My mom is going to have a really tough time accepting this.

How do I help my brother? I don't want to ignore this and pretend This isn't happening.

Summary: my brother is on drugs, he doesn't know I know, he just moved in his (suspected)addict girlfriend and her child, plan on meeting with his friends tomorrow to find out extent of drugs, will tell my parents findings, they will be devastated. Want my brother to know I'm there for him. Also I'm leaving in a day and a half, but may extend my trip if I feel it will help sort through this with my parents.

Advice? I'm just so devastated and don't know how to approach. I'm so scared I've been hearing about all the overdoses on the news and am afraid he will die.


Update: it's been bad for at least a year and a half.  How does he function how does he still have a job? Im so heartbroken. I think I've cried for 12 hours straight. I've asked him to come out to speak to me, I hope he shows up.",1499063547.0

Last night I tried oxycodone for the first time, and well, lets just say it was nothing what I expected.

Doing a lot of research I got really excited for this ""Fuzzy, warm, feel like im in heaven"" type of high im about to get. I was able to obtain some 5MG Oxycodone IR. Pill looks exactly like [this.](https://www.cvs.com/webcontent/images/drug/DrugItem_18370.JPG) So my initial dose I was going to take was 10mg because after researching, so many people got a somewhat high off it due to zero tolerance, and I figured if I dont feel anything, just pop one more 5mg. This is how my night went.

* 12:15 AM - I crush up two pills (10mg) and parachute it with toilet paper. I fill nothing at all for the next 30 minutes.
* 12:45 AM - Outta no where I feel very nauseous. I become very sweaty and hot, try my best to hold in vomit but I puke 3 times. My body felt very relieved and cool after throwing up. (I ate a steak plate about 4 hours prior to this)
* 1:00 AM - I start to wonder if the pills didn't have enough time to absorb into my body and if I threw them up. I assumed that I threw them up.
* 1:15 AM - I take 2 more pills orally (10mg) and swallow them. I start to browse the internet.
* 1:30 AM - I still feel nothing so I swallow another (5mg)
* 1:45 AM - I still feel nothing so I swallow another (5mg)
* 2:00 AM - I still feel nothing unfortunately, I felt a little high, but it was more of a dizzy out of it feeling, like if you were to get a buzz from from alcohol. I decided to lay in my bed.
* 2:10 AM - I decide to pop another (5mg)
* 2:20 AM - I decide to pop just one more. (5mg)
* 2:30 AM - I start to feel pretty relaxed, when I would touch my body with my hand it felt super nice. I was browsing through reddit and started to nod, my eyes would slowly close and when I tried to open them back up, it felt like they were stuck. I had to kinda focus to stay awake and get back into it. It was a pretty good high but I was expecting so much more like all these people talk about, at this point I took 30mg for my first time doing it! Keep in mind i took 10mg before i threw up. I guess I just had a high natural tolerance.
* 3:15 AM - My best friend texts me and me and her start talking about this girl that I absolutely adore, during the high I felt really confident and good about myself, so I got really excited and happy talking about this girl, this is when I realized my high completely went away, I didn't feel drowsy, my body didn't feel good anymore. I was completely disappointed! I decided to stay up a little longer due to fear of falling asleep after taking so much pills for my first time, I no longer felt the high at all.
* 5:00 AM - Still not high at all, I finally decide I feel sobered up enough and ready to go to sleep with no worries.
* 6:50 AM - I randomly woke up from a dream and I was **HIGH AS SHIT!!!!!!!! My body felt so warm, fuzzy, it felt so much better than the high I had before I went to sleep. When I was wrapped up in my blanket it felt like a fucking cozy hot burrito. I felt so fucking good,** when I tried to get up and move my head tho I felt very dizzy and a little bit nauseous, not enough to throw up, so i decided to just lay there and close my eyes and enjoy. This high felt amazing but it only lasted around 15 minutes, after when I touched my stomach with my hand, it no longer felt as fuzzy and warm, I could tell it was going away. I probably knocked out around 7:15 AM.
* 11:00 AM - I wake up and still feeling nauseous when I would try to look around, I also am having a headache. Decided to back to sleep after drinking some water.
* 3:00 PM - I wake up feeling alright now, just a little headache but it went away in a few hours.

So in conclusion im fucking confused as shit! I took a dose of 30mg after throwing up 10mg, so in total 40mg. How come it took 6 hours after I fell asleep for the warm fuzzy feeling to come in, but by that time it was wearing off haha? The pills arent that old, they were prescribed April 21st. Im going to try getting high again in maybe 2-3 weeks as I know addictions can start from this, im feeling no withdrawals, just the excitement of wanting to feel the high I felt at 6am again. I was able to get some 25mg Promethazine pills and currently planning to take it next time (to help with nauseous and apparently it makes the oxy more potent?) with a 25mg dose of oxycodone, by crushing it up and mixing it up in grapefruit juice and sipping it, **thoughts?** 

**Any explanations of why what happened, happened, would help me a lot! Also advice and ideas for the dosage and how to take it next time would mean the world as I dont want to be wasting these pills. Im a 5'8'' M and weigh 120 pounds. Much love, John.**",1499063045.0

6kwqaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6kwqaq/dumb_question_about_subs/,2,https://redd.it/6kwqaq,sloan_fitch,Dumb question about subs.,"I have one fresh suboxone strip and a half used opened, half a strip. 

I have some oxy left but here's a scenario... If I take no more pills tonight or tomorrow then take a quarter of a sub strip the following day to stop WDs, then another quarter strip the following day, what happens the third day? Will the WD's be mild?

&nbsp;

I've been told this would be a waste. That I should just wait til I run out of pills then take the subs. It has been suggested that I take a half a sub strip on day one and two then taper down from there to zero.

&nbsp;

The reason I ask is because it would be nice to have some pills saved for later in the week. Then again, the subs are a useful tool for avoiding withdrawals so perhaps I should wait till I run out of pills and take them ending with a taper to get my money's worth after.

&nbsp;

**To be clear, my proposed scenario:**

Day 0 (Today): Stop taking any more pills.

Day 1 (late tomorrow): Take my first quarter of a Sub strip late in the evening when I encounter my first symptoms. Maybe wait til the following morning to take the quarter sub. I understand the importance of waiting til you feel sick and avoiding PWDs.

Day 2: Feel fine, do nothning. If I start feeling unwell, take a quarter sub strip. 

Day 3: I have the option to open up the unopened sub and cut another quarter. More than likely I would save it for later in the week. Why? Because I'll have some unused pills I'll want to take later in the week.. so I may need this fresh sub for avoiding symptoms after that.

&nbsp;

Pardon the dumb question, and it has already been suggested that I get rid of the pills and go straight to using the subs. Can't honestly say that's an option I'm taking seriously but it's probably good advice.

&nbsp;

Regardless, I've never taken a Sub before so I suspet that I can benefit from a quarter Sub. If I do keep taking the pills and I run out, please let me know if I should take half a sub strip on my first day instead of a quarter.

Thank you all for your time, stay safe and be happy.",1499042382.0

As a user: The absence of this person will make my own ability to afford/ procure shit exponentially harder. I worry: am I going to have them back any  soon or is this permamant?

So if you are reading this you're thinking about trying H, and because you're scared of needles (and needles are for loser junkies, am I right?) you will likely snort (USA!) or smoke (UK!) it. I smoked it.

Well, I can't advise you for shit, but I can give you my story, if you're interested. 

First, I own 2 companies, I'm rather wealthy, I drive a very cool car and I wear a suit. So not all junkies started from the gutter. In fact, in my case, It was just a matter of being curious and highly stressed, and quite frankly I could totally afford it and why the fuck not, hey?

When I first tried, though, I was OH SO CAREFUL with the dosages, I read everything about it. I did my research! I thought I had this in the bag. Simple plan: 'chip', in other words, never do it twice 2 days in a row, keep the dosage low, easy peasy. It was in the bag. I'll do it once a week. I'll have so much fun!

And then I tried it. And not much happened. In fact, nothing happened. I was very disappointed! I researched some more. I slightly increased the dosage. I stopped using it after a few days of trying, because i was scared the stuff I had was 'fake', and I had read the story about fentanyl contamination. Freaked me out a bit. 

But then, I ordered some more. I was on a mission. I wanted to be high. I wanted to be the way they show in the movies, floating 3 meters above my bed, happy, euphoric. I wanted it, and I could easily afford the best stuff. So I ordered more from a new dealer, the most expensive one i could find, and well, it was the same! Boring! Not much happened. 

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was getting hooked. It honestly didn't feel like it. I thought it was a bit garbage as a high compared to say, K or LSD or even weed, where you know you are fucked up. In this case, it was just a (very) mild buzz. But it was comforting, especially in the .2-.3g region. It helped me 'relax'. 

And then one day, I don't know how long it took, maybe 3-5 months in, one day I went on holiday and I had a supply with me 'just in case', and I ran out. I didn't know it then, but I was taking a lot more in than I thought I was. I was taking it constantly in fact. Morning, sure, why not, goes well with breakfast (cue 'breakfast of champions' jokes). Spa day? You betcha! Relaxing in the lounge? You betcha. So, well, I ran out, on the toilet of one of the best hotels in town, on the 43rd floor to be specific. I'll always remember that day and that toilet.

What could possibly go wrong? Well, matter of fact, quite a lot. 12 hours after my last dose, while shopping with the wife, I started getting this weird-ass flu. Then diarrhoea. ""The fish at that restaurant was bad"" I joked. But then i started getting really cold, like when you get cold sweats, and your hair stands up on your skin. And my wife looked at me and said ""you look like a turkey"". So I'm in 5 star hotel on holidays and my skin looks like a turkey and i'm starting to be nauseous and I can't stop shitting. 

And then it hit me. A quick google (which I immediately regretted) explained it all. The Super-Flu. The W/Ds. The pain. The 'cold turkey' (get it?) skin. It was all there. It was staring at me in the face. By now I was also 'playing' with uppers and downers, you know, for fun and for work of course, but I had stopped counting the dosages as carefully as I did when I started. It all seemed so normal though.

I had lost track of time, amounts, whatever I was ingesting. But laying in the hot bath to prevent muscle cramps I suddenly realized I was absolutely FUCKED. So what did I do? I looked for a dealer, any dealer. I cut some onions and got some gear 24h later. Sweating, vomitting, shitting in my hotel suite with a (beautiful) view I finally received the 'package' (by then I was checking on it every 10m, getting upset at the reception desk) and I thought to myself, well, if I take this and I'm better, then I'll know.

And sure enough, that very 60 seconds later, then I knew. All the pain, gone. The sweats, gone. The diahrea, gone. Vomiting no more. Happy again. Calm. Relaxed. Normal.

**Welcome to addictionville, population: you.** I went through the supply (if you are hooked, you realize quickly you have absolutely no choice), flushed the surplus at the airport and flew out only to get home, and lit up again. But thankfully, by then, my wife and everyone around me knew. They had seen the turkey skin, the way I acted. They all fucking knew. So I had no choice but to hit up my doctor and tell him the absurd truth: I was hooked on heroin. He looked at me funny at first, as if 'you?' but here it was. 

So now I've been 13 days clean, and I have subutex to thank for making it a lot easier. But I won't lie to you, it really sucks. I think about H all the time. I'm isolated, depressed, lonely. I let everyone down, my family first, then myself. I fucked up hugely and i'm paying the price. 

It could have been worse though. Just before I left for the holidays I was researching how to purify #3 into #4 and injecting. So there it was: the big league, the end of the line, the Philip Seymour Hoffman ""I can't believe THIS guy did H"" story. All ready for me. And it's now ready for you.

So, I'm not your mum, your dad, or your doctor, but take it from me. There's no big hoopla anyways, you're not missing on anything, you're not going to get that big high you were looking for smoking or snorting it. The only way to get the euphoria is mainlining it and you and I both know that's not what you want.

Honestly I feel really bad for this girl, she's only like 19 and already a full blown junkie. I knew she was desperate for drugz so I split a g with her and smoked her down on hard. She was so thankful she opened up to me about how her boyfriend takes most of her dope when she's the one who has to hustle for it. I know her boyfriend, he's a punk ass little bitch and I told her that he ain't shit, why are you putting up with that fuckshit? She said she didn't have anywhere else to go, so I told her she could stay with me. I'm not going to lie, this girl is a dime and I have a huge crush on her. Of course I'm not going to take advantage or whatever, so now she's crashing at my place. It's cool, I have nothing worth pawning lmao and she hooked me up with her main dboy who has straight fire dope and crystal so I've been shooting goofballs which is fucking awesome and I don't have to deal with my old dboy who was a dick and he was over charging me for fucking stepped on dope, so everything worked out well. I don't think I'm even going to smoke hard anymore now that I got a solid hook up for crystal, not the fucking shake that's usually around. Fuck that. Crystal is so much better than hard because it lasts so much longer and it's actually a productive high unlike hard. When I'm on hard all I want to do is more hard lmao but I get shit done on crystal, like I spent six hours rearranging all of my furniture. I didn't even realize it had been that long wtf my hustle game has really stepped up since I don't sleep and I'm really focused on making that bread. I mostly spend all of my money on drugz and bills, you know adult shit, but I need to make more money so I can get a car. I got a shit ton of fines I have to pay off, my license is fucking suspended because I wrecked my car when I was on xanax lmao I broke my brain in the crash I've been trapped in another dimension ever since, I think I literally actually died and this is what death is like, I'm telling you shit has been weird af ever since and now I'm like a god of the wired.

So my circumstances that require opiate use are not changing. I of course enjoy the buzz and relief the oxy provides, but the main reason why I take oxy is for legit pain. If the pain were to be eliminated, I would hands down detox and get off the pills. I know it would be difficult but I would do it. At the moment however, I have to accept that I probably will stay on opiates and continue towards my goals. I'm still young and have dreams to accomplish, but I am worried that opiates will get in the way.

Asking for some prayers and wishes of luck for near future.,"I made an appointment in about 5.5 hours from now so I'd have enough time to talk to family and prepare, but I'm going to a local specialty ""hospital"" that has wards that double as a detox and mental health unit. I'm really going for the mental health despite banging dope every night for the last week instead of my normal 1-2 nights a week then going back to my sub script. Even if it was to purely stop the dope I'd be better off at home since you're allowed to take methadone there but even with a script you cant bring or take suboxone there even with a doctor's script.

I've been struggling a lot lately and even though there's been the drug use, the majority of the problems lay rooted in mental health. I was already on ""very think ice"" with my PO who's pretty accepting when it comes to addiction problems. My second week out of jail he knew I was using so I stopped for a short while. I only see him once a month and he's never once tested me since March. With so much time in between, even though he never tests me I took a gamble and lost and he did test me last week on a morning where I'd shot up less than an hour prior.

I'm going in now in small part because I think it'll look better preemptively and leave him a message as soon as his office is open tomorrow explaining where I've been at. The past week which is when I've been using, 99% of the reason I was using was to put myself in a good enough mood where I would stop wanting to kill myself. Sounds like Bull but I don't get high anymore, at best I just become a more pleasant person to be around. I'm more relaxed and joking but if I even hit a vein which I suck at, the stuff I can find around here only keeps me high for maybe 10 minutes. But like I said this is fine because since I can't work since a surgery I hang with my mom several hours each day and we have a lot more fun when I'm in this mood.

I've written 3 suicide notes this week because I've been doing so much dope each night I don't know how I'm alive. I'm slightly over 3 grand in debt just this week to give you an idea of how much I was using so the detox is probably going to be my worst yet. I'll tell my PO that I'm sorry but writing a letter then holding a large kitchen knife to my wrists and 90% the way to slicing, I decided heroin was the lesser evil in my mind and I can only hope he sympathizes. Every morning I woke up even after mixing all that dope with benzos I'd rip up the suicide note to my mom and continue the same the next day. I have severe anxiety and depression, doctors have battled whether I'm manic, bipolar or 10 other things, I just know the meds now are not doing it obviously I wouldnt be so close to offing myself every night.

I feel like I'm ranting so I'll stop but I basically wanted to say by for the 7-9 days they usually keep you even though they say pack for 3 and hope it's not longer till I'm back because with this bad urine, even if my PO wants to give me a break, if his supervisor overides him I'll be going away for a good while since I have 8 years of back up time for a violation.

Please keep me in mind and if you remember pray for me or at least wish me good luck in my recovery. I plan on keeping it once this is over. It's caused every bad thing in my life and I know I'm better than this.",1499017869.0

-------

## Original Post

You want to sell Fentanyl? I have no problem with that. You want to press them into pills that look like Oxycodone or other opiates? That's where people start to die. You can press your fentanyl into anything, it doesn't have to look like a real oxycodone unless you're trying to dupe someone. Even if you inform your customers, you can't know if they'll resell it. You're the one LEO is going to come after when someone inevitably dies. And yes, most states are now charging people with manslaughter for fent overdoses.

So recently, it's been discovered that the new Fentanyl pee test strips will easily detect fent in pills, too. You break a small piece off, get it into a fine powder, and add 2.5ml of water. Dip the strip in per instructions and presto. It works on just about everything, from heroin, tar, coke and of course, pills. I've tested myself and the results came back quickly positive for Fent.

The same process works for the carafent strips as well. The strips can be found on many websites, including eBay where you can get 10 for like $14. That's $1.40 a piece. I'm hoping with increased awareness, we can finally start leaving relevant reviews and/or shaming the vendors who are killing people (may sound like hyperbole but I've had 2 friends die and many more hospitalized). If we make it so people know who the good vendors are, and who the scumbags are, we can at the very least hurt their business and at best, educate people and reduce the opportunity for harm, maybe even save some lives.

These test strips didn't exist until recently (or at least, weren't readily available) so maybe now we can utilize this tool to reduce harm and maybe even make it not profitable to sell these killer pills.

---------

### Concerns by zero day account rebuked

There was a commentor who commented about the validity of the tests, more specifically, the fact that it had been pulled off the shelves because the health agency in Canada hadn't approved it. He was so impassioned about trying to prove these test strips were bunk that it went beyond simple concern and education into mania. He was vehemently and violently reacting to the post. If someone was just concerned with accuracy, they'd do so calmly. Someone to act the way he did is closer to feeling threatened. I'm almost certain the guy is a counterfit oxy (fent pressed pill) dealer on the darknet, after all, the post originally took place in the darknet market subreddit


To address the fact that it was pulled off the shelves; it wasn't pulled off because it was ineffective, it was pulled because they didn't pay for approval/licensing. In the U.S, it costs *a fortune* for FDA approval, and I assume it's not much different in Canada. These are a very niche product and the company making them isn't Pfizer, they cannot afford (yet) to become certified for specific avenues of distribution. Same with 3rd party independent scientific testing, it's an expensive and long process. They'd be competing for lab time with companies like Pfizer trying to get their latest medication pushed through, and willing to throw a bunch of money at it to skip long waits. I'm sorry, but those are unrealistic expectations.

If you search google, the response for these tests have been *overwhelmingly* positive. I've yet to find a single negative response or complaint. Everyone who has used these tests including several clinics in Canada are over the moon with them. One clinic has used over a 1000 tests without a single incident or false negative. That speaks volumes right there.

Since they're so cheap ($1.40 USD a piece) I recommend you try them yourself, and this way you can know yourself and you won't have to take anyone's word for it. I believe that's why the price is so cheap in the first place; they didn't spend a bunch of money on marketing, FDA tests and are not in dire need to recoup their initial investment. ",1499150722.0

The main thing my addiction has cost me has been my drivers license. This has made it nearly impossible to find a good job and keep it. 

The only real skill I've managed to really cultivate during the past decade of drug abuse has been cooking. First, I want to say I'm NOT A FUCKING CHEF. Don't call me a Chef, and please don't allow others to bullshit you when they call themselves a Chef.

Anyways, I'm really good at what I do, and I've done it in about every kind of restaurant known to man. Something about the pace and the pressure just really makes me shine. Also, I think growing up in the South made me really good at handling the heat and humidity. 

Now that we've established that, back to the opportunity. During these past 10 months or so, I've been cultivating my friendship with my old weed plug. Recently he's been working at this local place that's pretty damn swanky. Maybe not swanky to some, but $50-70 entrees are pretty fucking swanky in my book.

They have an opening. Currently, I have a decent job, but I'm not making what I want or getting enough hours. Also, there is no advancement to be had and nothing to learn. Also, he knows my situation, and he's willing to pick me up and get me home if need be. 

I'm not gonna lie guys, I'm fucking 27 years old and have never made more than $12/hr. I have ALWAYS had a 40 hour a week job. Working is vital to funding a drug habit. 

This is an opportunity to make $14 an hour starting and upwards of $20 eventually. Also, OVERTIME. Thats huge. I love working, it keeps me sober.

She always told me ""you don't need any medicine just get up and do stuff"" and at first I believed her, I tried, and it ended up hurting me a lot more. I got a new pain management specialist and he confirmed I most likely have fibromyalgia and that he wanted to me continue on with my life and do something with it, so he decided to help me with my pain and now has prescribed me Percocet 10/325 120x pills a month. I can finally stop buying from dealer and taking the risk. Oxycodone and opiates alike were the only things that seemed to stop my pain and now that I have a prescription it takes a lot of stress off of me and I can focus on my life. To the people who NEED opiates like I do for my pain, if you have a pain management specialist and they refuse to give you what you really NEED, then switch it up. Look for another specialist who may be able to help you.  

PS: I just ordered Kratom a few days ago and now I'm like ""that was a waste of money"" because I was trying to find a pain reliever since my original pain management specialist denied me any type of pain relief. 

EDIT: Just took 3 pills and holy crap, almost no pain. There's one spot on my back but besides that...it's gone. Worse comes to worse I may needa take one more. I have 120x because I told my doctor about my tolerance to opiates an he said ""Here take 4 a day then"". ",1499138363.0

And I didn’t really operate much differently from the way some of my friends did. Yet, they were dead and I was not. Undoubtedly, I was lucky.
 
*It’s got nothing to do with luck,* I thought to myself.
 
I laid there in my bed, staring at the white ceiling, as I had been for an hour. The room was beginning to brighten as the sun rose and I tried, unsuccessfully, to ignore the increasingly raucous singing of the birds outside--as this was always an irritating reminder to me that life goes on, with or without my inclusion.
 
Anyway, I wasn’t entirely delusional though. I was historically a careful user, as many of us are when we begin.
 
*I’m not an idiot about it.*
 
*I do test shots.*
 
*I use clean needles and alcohol pads.*
 
*I own two vials of narcan, for fuck’s sake.*
 
However, as my addiction progressed and my resources dwindled, I learned that my cautiousness was expendable. It was not as integral of a part in my use anymore than a bag of sour-patch watermelons were. It was nice to have, but only as time or resources allowed. They were luxury items.
 
I had a bit of a selective memory when it came to certain things. I failed to remember all the times I had to shoot up with warm, week old, half empty, gatorade from my trunk. Or, time and time again, when I had to jab the blunted needle into the crook of my arm because I had missed the open hours of the needle exchange by 5 minutes. Or the time I was with my dealer who passed out after registering the needle in his vein, so I pulled it out of his arm and shot it in my own, blood and all.
 
That is to say, it got pretty fucking grimey towards the end.
 
So, I laid there in bed, feeling the opiates from the previous night slowly but unceasingly peeling themselves off my receptors. I knew my blurry vision wasn’t so much my sleepy eyes as it was my pupils beginning to dilate as withdrawal set in. And as much as I didn’t want to get out of bed and begin all the stuff I had to do that day, I met my limit to how long I could wait with drugs and needles at the ready.
 
I saved a shot for the morning and a shot for the airplane, and for that I was proud of myself. After I got out of bed I got up and went to fix in the bathroom.
 
As I sat on the edge of the bathtub, I noticed that my once flourishing pipeline of bulging veins now looked like a withered grapevine on my pale forearm. My “go-to” vein was now only working once or twice a day. It took me a little longer than normal to get the shot off, but I got it done. My morning could start now.
 
The trip into San Francisco went smoothly. When we arrived downtown my Dad parked the car alongside the entrance to the station. I was to hop on the 7:05am train that would take me straight to the airport. Keeping one eye out for parking enforcement, my parents got out and we began saying our goodbyes. 
 
Mid hug, it dawned on me that they had just dropped my little brother off at college the weekend prior. Now they were dropping their eldest off for drug treatment. If my goal was to make my parents proud, I don’t believe I was doing a stellar job. 
 
My dad gave me a hug and we finished saying goodbye. We stood there for a moment on the sidewalk in silence. More than anything they have ever done (or not done) for me, I hated the way they would look at me most of all.
 
“Alright buddy, we hope you find what you’re looking for.”
 
“Yeah, thanks,” I replied. “Although I have no idea what that might be.”
 
“Yeah, yeah, I get it. We just want you to be happy. Your mom and I, we… we haven’t always handled this the right way. But we want you to know we’re rooting for you.”
 
He took a pause and continued, “Lucas, it’s just that… well, you're in a rut. But you have so much--
 
“Please don’t fucking say that,” I interjected. “Please, I’m so sick of hearing that. The fact is, it doesn’t matter.”
 
He looked at me with that goddamn sadness in his eyes that I came to resent more than anything.
 
“Alright, I gotta go now. Love you guys. Thanks for everything.”
 
And with that, I headed for the platform.
 
I turned and stood briefly on the sidewalk and watched them as they drove away. I took a moment to center myself before I began the journey. It was the calm before the storm, I needed a second just to stand there and do nothing. I tried to take a deep breath and relax a bit but it wasn’t working. 
 
“Hey brother, you got a few bucks?”
 
Annoyed, I opened my eyes and looked back at the skinny homeless man in his huge, bright red puffy jacket. I wanted to laugh. Not at the homeless man, but at the fact he thought I might be a good prospect to have available cash.
 
“You're asking the wrong guy.”
 
“Just a couple dollars would be enough man. You see, my girlfriend, she needs that infant formula shit for our kids ya see, and if you could just help out man.”
 
*Ugh, we got a fucking salesman.*
 
He continued, “Bro, I don’t think I told you my name man I’m sorry man, my name is--”
 
“--Brother, listen to me. You are asking the wrong guy.” I said with a finality only a depraved and desperate dope fiend could muster. And it was enough.
 
He didn’t bother giving me a dirty look, just muttered “asshole” like it was second nature to him, cuffed up his puffy red jacket, and walked away.
 
The pace and density of the crowd around me was starting to pick up as I approached the entrance to the tunnel. I looked at all their tired, annoyed, and unexcited “starting the workday” faces with such jealousy. They had purpose. They were going somewhere. I’m not even talking figuratively, but they literally had somewhere to be, like at a certain time. They were all going to a place where their presence mattered. I could step on these train tracks and the the immediate world would continue without so much as a hitch. I was so wound up, my emotions were all over the board. 
 
In that moment, I decided I was going to let the next train pass and head to the Tenderloin to cold cop some nasty shit. It was unlikely that the H there would even make a dent with my tolerance, but it was better than nothing. This is when I noticed the couple.
 
Amongst the crowds of people hurrying to work, heads down, hustling to their destinations, a man and a woman caught my eye. A beautiful Asian woman with big eyes sauntered beside her man, smiling. They stood out distinctly against the backdrop of the purposeful movement. They seemed to be just… walking, as opposed to going somewhere. They were smiling, enjoying eachother’s company. I don’t really know why it caught my attention they way it did. They were just walking aimlessly.
 
Something unlocked inside of me. It happened slowly at first but then began to snowball. I could feel my delusions beginning to crack, their weight no longer bearable. A brief, unadulterated glimpse of what I really was opened up before me.
 
I was now on the escalator, descending into the station. 
 
Here I was, a 27 year-old able-bodied college graduate from a good family who had been given more than enough opportunity in life. And I would constantly compare myself to others, prior friends, co-workers. I’d follow them on social media, seeing how well they are doing, standing back from a distance, watching them get promotions, go on vacations, buy houses, start families. 
 
And I would think to myself, *I could be that! I could be that, if only… if only I could just get that awesome job I want. If only my parents would let me crash at their place so I could save rent money and buy a car. If only those fucks at the methadone clinic would accept the lower rate for me, I could get my shit together and be a part of my family and friends again. If only that girl from the neighborhood grocery store would see the real me, she’d love me and everything would be good. All these amazing things, the car, the house, the vacations, and the wife with 2.5 kids, they are all just within reach! If only a couple good things would come my way I’d be there too!*
 
Oh man, how blind I was. 
 
In that moment, I knew that not only were these things not even remotely attainable, but something as simple as going for a walk was well out of reach. Enjoying a walk. Something as fucking simple as enjoying a walk, was absolutely, utterly, unattainable to me. I knew this to be a fact. I could just imagine someone asking me to go with them on a quick walk, a little stroll to spend some time together, it would go something like this:
 
“Hey Lucas, want to go a walk with me?”
 
“Sure, where are we going?”
 
“Oh, nowhere in particular.”
 
“Haha, what? For real though, where are we headed?”
 
“Nowhere, I just want to spend some time with you and enjoy the scenery.”
 
“Um, ok...I guess, so. But we gotta hurry, I gotta be back here in 30 min cause my dboy is coming, and I want to be back early in case I miss him. He’s never been early before, but you never know, you know?”
 
“That doesn’t seem like much of an enjoyable walk, but alright, let’s go.”
 
“Oh wait... are there bathrooms along the way? I need a bathroom to fix, preferably one with a lock. Let’s map this out so we can find one along the way. We should find the shortest route.”
 
“Um, you know what, just forget about it.”
 
It sounds silly, but enjoying a walk, with the sole purpose of just enjoying a walk, was not within my realm of possibilities. And if I was not capable enough to accomplish such a simple feat, how on earth could I possibly get that awesome job? The girl? The car? The house? 
 
I could feel my delusion’s crumbling before me, and the idea of it all falling down and being able to see myself for what I really was scared the shit out of me. I was a pathetic, weak, lying, cheat, and most of all I was a terrified. I was a scared little boy beyond my facade. Everyone in my life could see beyond the mask I wore, except for me. I thought I wore the mask to hide from others but really I was hiding me from myself.
 
I found myself standing in the the station, facing the tracks, near the edge of the platform.
 
It felt like the fucking ground was about to fall out beneath me, it felt like my world was shaking. As a matter of fact, it was; the train was approaching. My body shuddered, the cobwebs and delusions were shaking themselves out, but a part of me desperate to hold on to them. I stepped closer and could feel the air pressure change as the incoming train drove the air forward. It felt good across my face. I could taste the freedom.
 
In an instant, I was jerked back and lifted off my feet. 
 
“Aghhh!,” was all I managed to blurt out.
 
I fell back into a cushion, something soft. I looked back, dumbfounded. It was a red puffy jacket. 
 
“The fuck is wrong with you man!” I shouted.
 
Confused, I threw off his arms and stood myself back upright.
 
“What the fuck was that for?” I yelled to the guy in the red.
 
His eyes widened and he cocked his head to the side, incredulous.“What was that for? What was that for? You a fucking retard man?! You’s about to fuck wit them tracks right there!” 
 
He pointed towards the railroad tracks as his voice increased, trying to be heard over the sound of the approaching train.
 
The blast of the horn made me jump. The floor shaking subsided as the the train slowed and came to a halt right in front of me. The doors parted and a hoard of people late for work bustled onto the platform, enveloping me as a swarm. I stood still and let them part around me. 
 
“White people, man. The fuck?” He said to no one in particular, shaking his head.
 
I thought about that couple, the smiling Asian woman. Surely, they were long gone by then, off to the park, or a coffee shop, wherever they were going. But the message lingered. It was an outward projection of an inner peace that I didn't have--but wanted more than anything.
 
I looked up at the guy standing in front of me, he was still shaking his head, his fake gold chain swaying back and forth.
 
“Well, thanks, I guess. And… and just so you know, I really don’t have any money man. I’m sorry. I would’ve given you a few bucks if I had it.”
 
He looked me up and down for a moment, and responded, “Alright, I believe you man.” 
 
“Well, uh,” I started, “I hope you find what you’re looking for.” As soon as I said it, I wanted to punch myself for sounding so stupid. But it was all I could think of to say. I turned to leave.
 
--”Bruh,” he grabbed me by the shoulder to face him and pulled me closer, his face suddenly stoic.

""Sometimes man, you know, when I'm on one, 10 n' 2 with that pipe ya know, I be up for like days man. I like to watch animal planet on the television. Like twacked the fuck out n shit. I see hyenas in my room. And they kept coming back, every time I be smokin now. Like scary ass hyenas, man, from Africa.""

""Huh? Ok, I gotta go. See ya later.""

""And, at first, I tried to fight em. Like knife those muthafuckas. Fuck em up big time. I be choking them, I even lit them mothafuckas on fire homie, I tried everything man. I couldn't get it done though, it just made shit worse. I was going off the hook being all crazy n shit tryin to get rid of these fucking hyenas man. So, eventually I just gave up man, I didn't know what else to do. And I just would sit there with them. Ya know, like kick it wit them, they be chillin with me on my couch and everything. They was freakin me the fuck out, ya, but they never attacked me or nothin. They never tore me apart me like I thought. They just sat there lookin all scary n shit. And eventually, they would go on their way.""

""Wow, ok listen man, thanks for that, but I'm in a hurry."" I brushed his hand off my shoulder and turned to go, but he grabbed me again and turned me around. ""Dude, get you hands off--""

""You can't fight that shit man, them feelings man. You gonna make ya self go crazy tryna get rid of them. As scary as it sounds bruh, you just gotta sit next to them for a bit, and I promise you they will pass."" He gave me a pat on the shoulder and let go.
 
“What?"" I blinked, trying to come to my senses. ""Er... ya, ok.” I replied, “Thanks.”

The man rolled up the sleeves of his jacket, turned, and left without another word.
 
I stood there for a second and contemplated what the homeless meth head just said to me, until the door chime on the train sounded it's last call. The doors began to close, and I lurched forward. I was finally on my way.

I sit on my mother's back porch chain smoking her Marlboro lights. I've had a headache going on 2 days now. She was supposed to quit after she finished the carton before this, and the carton before that. 

She knows addiction all too well. She's an alcoholic coming up on 23 years sober, and has had the displeasure of watching me, her son, struggle for the past 10 years. 

She hates herself that she can't quit, almost as much as I hate myself that I can't. 

The reprieve from opiates is no longer there, yet I can't step away. I miss the days where a shot would quiet everything. A demon to quiet the other demons. 

Today is my 27th birthday. They suck every year. By no means is this post looking for sympathy, just need to vent. It sucks when you know so many people yet only 5 or so will go out of their way to even wish a happy birthday, but I understand people are caught up with their own lives and I'm nothing special. 

I'm one year closer to death and one year further from happiness. Closer to falling apart and further from anything resembling my interpretation of success. 

I did $105 worth of dope today and I'm just as miserable had I not done any. The only thing it quiets is my phone as my dealer doesn't text to ask if I'm all set. 

I don't think I want to die, but sometimes the effort required for this life makes me want to lie down for a very long time. I've been working for 6 weeks and haven't gotten a paycheck yet, I think that may be fucking with my head too? 

I could have been so many other places right now, but a series of poor decisions has narrowed paths and dimmed lights that once beamed bright. The worst thing is I know that these are all my thoughts that I have a hard time differentiating from reality. Im sure I could still do plenty of things but I build all of my biggest barriers. 

I had a much better worded/less scattered post typed out but when I get a phone call while typing it erases my post, which upset the living fuck out of me. Guess I am really delicate today. Sorry for the rant, I'll probably end up deleting this post later when Im embarrassed how whiney/bitchy it sounds. Goodnight opifam. I love you.",1499127126.0

So either way I was gonna be fine cuz I was feeling good, as long as I didn't get ripped off.

I go to where I thought was the ""druggie hangout"" part of town. I saw a girl exiting a building/homeless shelter and she had a can of beer in her hand. Where I'm from, people 'round that area with beer cans in their hands are junkies. It's just a safe tell.

It's this 30 year old chick and I'm just like ""Hey, stupid question but I got money, you got a source for opiates?""

She says: ""Opiates, yeah. How much?""

Me (sorta oblivious): "" what do you mean how much?""

Then she says: ""40 bux is that k""

I reply ""yup that's fine, but like is it codeine, hydrocodone, oxys, opana, heroin...?""

and she was like ""it's h""

So I said dope, I just won't hand over any cash until I see the product, which the chick was fine with. She calls up this dude and he shows up 5 mins later, about 45 years old looking like 80 just a full on druggie stereotype. 

He goes to get his stash and gives me my part and lets me have a look before I hand over the cash.

I gave the middle 20 bux out of generousity cuz she helped me out and she also got some h. 

I asked her about what the fent situation is like and if there's a chance mine has any in it, and she says nah man. Half the city comes here constantly, it's the best you'll find

so I felt reassured about it not being fent laced. Am not north american so the fent thing isn't really an issue here. I said bye to both of them and told them to enjoy the nods.

The product's really good, long lasting and not any of the fent symptoms (has euphoria, long legs, doesn't hit ""hard af"" etc.)

Cold copping: **Success**

first person I asked too, got real lucky. Happy, nodding person here now.

The complete left-side of my face swelled up larger than a 90s baseball player on 'roids, and I had to have an emergency tooth extraction a couple hours ago. The infection got so bad (and over a relatively short amount of time) that I need to go back in a couple days so the dentist can be sure the antibiotics he prescribed are working. Otherwise, he said I would need surgery. And to top it off, it cost me about $1k to get all this work done today (although my insurance should reimburse me for some of the cost).

And this situation is completely my own fault... A steady diet of opis, sugar, and a lack of proper oral hygiene (due to nodding out all the time at night before brushing) over the decades is a recipe for dental nightmares.

I still need a bunch of dental work done, but my dentist made me a treatment plan and we're gonna take care of my other issues in chunks at a time, due to the costs. However, maybe now I won't need dentures by the time I'm 40 years old, like I figured previously. Either way, I'm still facing a bunch of pain, time and money to correct my negligence over the years.

It sucks being in constant oral pain and not be able to eat what you want, or to have to chew your food on just one side of your mouth. So please, please, please learn from my pain and mistakes, and take care of your mouth! Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss at least once.

Fast forward a few months when I am in jail for testing dirty. In my court hearing my PO testified that this doc told her that I was actively abusing drugs specifically designed to not show up on drug tests. I did sign a release so he didn't break the law but still a total dick move.

I just aquired an 8mg capsule with hydromorphone as the medicine ""Palladon"". In my current circumstances that is quite a sizable amount of drug.

I'd like to make some inquires about how to consume it effectively. I'm an occassional user so no need to advice me on ""banging that shit"" lol. I found this short guide on this sub

>If you want to get the best effect without IV, hydromorphone is best dissolved in a 5% ethanol solution, so basically 1part everclear to 9parts whatever measurement(drops or ml) distilled water.
>Then filter and put the solution in a nasal spray container and squirt it up your nose or you can put it in a non needle syringe and squirt it up your ass.
>You'll get a much better effect nasally because you are removing the binders, and adding low alcohol water which dilates the blood vessels and moistens the mucus membranes to help with absorbstion.


Would this work if I just open the capsule put into and old nasal spray bottle with a mixture of 1 part whiskey and 8 parts water and then just wait? Is it very important to ""filter"" it? Whatever that means. The capsule seems to contain small pebbles that wouldn't dissolve easily perhaps.

Should I dissolve it and spray it or just crush it and snort it? What about dosage. I know this must seem petty to every user here of higher scale, but this little bit of drug is quite important to me so I'd just like to check if the idea sounds good. 

Also a separate question. I'm the type of guy who gets high af and nauseous by 20mg oxy, how much hydromorphone would I need to get a good buzz? What can I expect from the high comparatively to stuff like Tramadol, oxies or Buphrenorphine?

It's been a little more than 2 weeks from my surgery. I was no longer in pain but I continued to take the oxycodone. I think you all probably know why. I know, I'm a shitty human being.

I also was very sweaty and had a headache. So I basically just gave up and took the rest of them. But then the feelings came back again after a bit and I just couldn't take it anymore so I did something I never thought I would do.
A while ago my awesome dog (the light of my life) got prescribed tramadol because she had an infection. She didn't need it anymore, but it was still in the house. So you can probably guess what I did. 
But it gets worse....
A while ago I had a knee surgery. I was prescribed hydrocodone. I didn't use any of it. So I was cleaning my room yesterday, and guess what I found? It's almost like the universe trying to get me hooked and screw up my life. It was scary how that happened.
I've decided I'm going to throw all of it away (the tramadol and hydrocodone), and then just stay in bed/sleep all day and try and make it through whatever that feeling was when I tried to taper down. 
What I was thinking was maybe some of you guys could tell some of your worst stories to help me through this, if you're comfortable with sharing. I want to hear about stuff like being in prison, facing your family, rape, prostitution, murder.... Just lay it all on me. Also I still don't have anyone to buy drugs from, it's unlikely I'll ever meet anyone like that, so I still think I'm safe for now, I just need to get rid of these drugs and get over that feeling. I know I'm playing with fire but I'm really going to try and stop. Thanks and sorry to bother you all.

Back in jan i had ACL surgery to fix my torn ACL. took some percocet the week after surgery to help with pain. no biggie, pain was INTENSE. Stopped after a week. 1 month went by and i actually got sick from the surgery and got a blood clot from my leg go into my chest and got pulmonary embolism!!! I am only 26! I spent 5 weeks in a hospital bed not knowing if i was going to make it. the pain was INSANE. I never cried/screamed so hard in my life. the entire time i was there they would shoot me up with dilaudid! Not my choice but it was totally needed with the pain i was in. had an injection of it every 3 hours for about 4 WEEKS! during week 5 they cut me off. I had HARD withdrawls. not eatting for days, shaking, feeling cold all the time. I just wanted to get out of the hospital. finally got out! thank god, no more pain medicane! 

As i started to get back to my normal life i had to start PT for my ACL surgery. It was going VERY bad since i was in a bed for so long. so much scar tissue built up. i NEEDED another surgery to get the scar tissue out. I did PT from late march until late may and id take 1 or 2 percocet when i went to help with pain.

on june 2nd they went back into my knee and removed scar tissue. got percocet again to deal with pain for the week after. took it when needed and to sleep. The next day after surgery i started PT again. They told me to take some percocet to help me deal with PT. so i was. I needed to, its super super painful and it was relaxing me and helping a lot. I go to PT about 5 times a week. 

So im taking percocet when i go to PT, then normally when i come home at night and need to sleep, my knee is so sore and aching i need some percocet to relax it. 

My entire issue with this is that from having my 1st ACL repair and being in the hospital for so long on pain meds NONSTOP. I have SUCH a high tolerance for percocet. When i go to PT i take 3 5-325 percocet. When i try and sleep for the night im taking anywhere from 3-5 percocet. Even when i take that much im fully aware of everything and it doesnt put me to sleep. I have been pretty much been taking percocet since january!!! My main problem is my recovery with my knee isnt going so well and i still need to get my knee bending fully in PT so i need to keep taking percocet to help with the pain during PT and i honeslty will need some when i try and sleep at night cause im so damn sore!

I feel like i have an addiction and maybe im kind of admitting it?  I dont know what to call this since my case is so odd. Tonight i just ran out of my 60 bottle of percocet that i got very recently. I could easily call up my doctor tm and let him know id like some more to help me during PT and he will gladly prescribe me another 60. I have not gone 1 full day since june 2nd without taking percocet. 

I just dont know what to do at this point. I need to recover from my horrible surgeries. Anytime i go into my knee doctors they cant stress enough that since my june 2nd surgery i need to get my knee bending and if i mention that im working on it in PT and its painful they tell me to take some percocet to help. The other week my doctor even gave me a supply of muscle relaxers to take with my percocet when i go to PT. they honeslty didnt do much since my tolerence is so damn high.

I just dont know what to do. Do i keep taking percocet to help me recover or will that just fuel my addiction that im like developing or already have. I feel like at this point i need them to sleep mentally in my head but also because im so damn sore and trying to sleep at night my leg is so uncomfortable.

any sort of advice would be greatful",1499237220.0

7 days ago I switched to suboxone to try a rapid taper, taking 2.5mg daily the first 4 days.  Now I can handle 0.5mg per day. 

I have mental and physical conditions that make withdrawals especially hard and I don't think I could successfully jump off yet. 

Should I keep taking buprenorphine, trying to continue to taper as much as I can?

I'm worried about taking it for more than a week and having my body dependent on it and thus having much longer withdrawals than heroin. 

Should I switch to tramadol and continue the taper with that, if I feel I can take it appropriately?

Or switch back to H for 1-2 weeks with my lowered tolerance and try tapering further with H, then switching back to subs if needed? 

Or some other plan????

I'm thankfully not even craving H at all, strangely.  And I for once finally truly want to quit.  The withdrawals are just so hard for me. 

Going on sub maintenance scares me because the withdrawals from bupe are so long.

This is hugely important for me.  I thank you all so much for past threads that I've read and learned a lot from.  Thank you for any suggestions.

*No airflow environment

*Protective clothes/gloves

*Utensils that are discarded after use, as are the gloves and clothes get changed

*MG scales, graduated cylinders. Treat 1 mg of carfent as 100 mg of regular fent. Make a weak solution, like 20 mg in 500 mL of water which would in a 0.1 mL nasal sprayer would be like 4 micrograms per spray--or close to 0.4 mg of fent per spray

*Maybe some alcohol for preservation, and salt to salinate everything

**So the drug itself:**

*Easily a 6 hour half life. Unheard of in a fent analogue, except FIBF which we agree is mostly useless. You can actually get a full nights sleep and then some.

*High analgesia

*Mild-Moderate sedation

*I haven't felt any significant breathing reduction no matter how much I re-dose, but it might just be that I made a weak solution.

*Even if you have a small amount, like 100 mg--that could last years.

*Not a real significant high, it's really functional.

**My opinion:**

This stuff would probably work better than suboxone or methadone in drug treatment. You can immediately stop withdrawals rather than have a junkie suffer for a few days, it works for severe pain relief like suboxone which could address why drug addiction occurred. If you had a tamper-proof sprayer that could only be used once every 6 hours, it would prevent the risk of death. The lack of a high would discourage this anyway. You do not need to go to a clinic constantly, except for refills and dosage adjustments which could be monthly (cheap). For working people, it's easy to schedule instead of spending every morning waiting for your methadone dose or waiting months to get enough trust to take a week's worth of suboxone home.


Disregarding the negativity surrounding this substance, I sincerely believe this is a godsend analogue for me. Although I realize the greed of others are ruining and creating an extremely negative connotation around something that could be useful in human treatment.",1499220184.0

Can anyone inform me of why they wouldn't just snort it.? They also cut his forehead then rubbed the heroin in the cut opposed to just snorting it again.

For those who are not aware, naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opiates (although respiratory depression can still occur, and people have overdosed while taking naltrexone).

I have a very short opiate history; started taking oxys (snorting) last November or so and quickly moved to about 160-170mg a day habit. Needless to say, I wasn't functioning very well and was spending a ton of money. I tried stopping on my own several times but the depression was too hard for me.

In April I paid a few thousand dollars for a rapid detox and a naltrexone pellet implanted in my abdomen at the end. They claim there are very minimal, if any, side effects. I've noticed since I got it (I'm on my second one now, they last 2-3 months) my anxiety is huge, my sleep is brutal, and I rarely feel happiness. 

The reason I think it's the naltrexone itself causing this is the week or so between pellets these symptoms were nearly gone - as soon as I got the new one in, the symptoms are back HARD. I was given benzos when I initially got the implant but now have nothing and find it hard to do even the most simple tasks (like....brush my teeth). 

Anyone else had similar effects with the implant, the vivitrol shot, or the daily pill? I'm really considering getting it removed but would love to hear some feedback. Cheers.",1499198555.0

Normally this wouldn't mean shit as *I'm broke* but she's got an internet boyfriend whom she has *never* laid eyes on, is ""in the military"" and can never quite seem to make it to meeting her in person. Every time he's ""on his way"" to her town, something happens - he's thrown back into combat on an urgent mission, or uhmm he get's detained by the military police and questioned about why he was the only one of his patrol that survived some top secret mission in Afghanistan. [*seriously!* You can't make this shit up]

She's a nice lady but completely delusional. **2 years** this has been going on and she routinely sends him money and has never met him in person.

Well, now she's banned from sending money via Walmart, it seems, and needs help from little ole' me. She needed me to send it for her. I couldn't think of any down side so I did it and she threw me a few percs. My tolerance is really low but not low enough that 3 percs blew me away or anything but I'm feeling good now.

ate them all and have a tiny buzz. 
highly over rated opiate imho. 

don't get me wrong I'm not ungrateful,
i know i was lucky to even get a chance to get the oxy but I'm still underwhelmed, 
i think maybe I over hyped them in my head before I tried them, if that's a thing anyways. 

i really want to try opana asap. lol

hope you are all flush and nodding out, or at least in the space you like to inhabit, high or otherwise.

Stimulants are destructive to the body and the psychology and the ability to function. Unsuited to regular use.  
Empathogens are horrendously neurotoxic. Unsuited to regular use.  
Psychedelics are completely non-functional. Unsuited to regular use.  
Benzos aren't recreational and, in the long-term, become quite toxic.   
Alcohol a shit.  


Opioids appear to be the only class of recreational drug which can be used frequently and without dreadful consequences. I've been using them in this manner, on and off, for a couple years and in spite of the physical addiction they've treated me well. The most 'sensible' alternative is sobriety but... we're junkies for a reason. Harm minimization is the realistic best choice for many of us, abstinence is a nice idea.

Needless to say there were many different opinions and people seem to have their own preferred way of potentiating oxy, and there were a lot of different ones. I read about grapefruit juice, Tagamet, benzos, benadryl, promethazine, the list went on. 

One that kept coming up quite frequently was diphenhydramine hydrochloride, sold here in Aus as Unisom Sleepgels, with each one containing only one active ingredient - the diphen hcl, and 50mg of it in each capsule to boot. 

Being a schedule 3 (over the counter) medicine, it seemed like an easy one to try. I already did the Phenergan and oxy and to be honest, other than reducing the oxy itch it really didn't do much (for me; others seem to have great reports). So I went to my local chem and purchased a box of 10 unisoms, cost me around $11. So, in fairness, I figured if it DID work it would also be quite an economical potentiator. 

Prior to my little experiment (about four hours beforehand) I'd had 4mg of Xanax and 10mg of valium (actually it was valpam thanks to the bloke who stole hundreds of thousands of valiums and replaced them with other medicines forcing Roche to completely recall their infamous white with a pink striped box diaz) so I was feeling pretty content as it was. The alpraz had relatively worn off but the Val was still mellowing me out (had some grapefruit juice to compliment it at the time as well). Without further ado, here's how this mix went down for me. 

7pm: swallowed a 50mg sleepgel (the diphenhydramine). Obviously initially felt nothing. 

7:15pm: the diphen hcl had started to kick in and I was feeling incredibly relaxed - definitely not sleepy by any definition of the term - but just warm and chilled out. 

7:35pm: Grabbed my beautiful little box of Endone and popped out four tabs, bit one in half in my mouth and had the other three full, so I ingested 20mg of immediate release oxycodone. 

7:55pm: I can already feel the oxy starting to wash over me, but nothing out of the ordinary and certainly no noticeably different effect. 

8:15pm: the fun started. There is no way how I felt was a placebo effect and I am now confident NOBODY will ever be able to convince me that diphenhydramine does nothing to the effect of the oxy. 

8:20-current: this is the most amazing feeling I have ever been graced with. The 20mg of oxy I swallowed is giving me the same effects as if I had had around 40-50mg. This feeling is beautiful. I am nodding as usual but I can feel the diphen working its magic on the Endone and it has DEFINITELY 100% potentiated the oxy effects far more than I had read or anticipated. 

I am floating on a cloud right now. Everything around me is so wonderful. Call this statement far fetched but I don't know how I will ever have oxy again without adding the diphen. It is pure bliss. Literally actual bliss. My conversations are fluent, my thoughts are nothing but positive and the occasional drifting into a closed eye daydream and coming back to is beyond explanation. 

This is by far the best experience I have ever had with oxycodone and I dont know why I hadn't done this sooner. I am absolutely certain this is NOT placebo. This feeling is just.....so above and beyond what oxy normally does both mentally and physically and I honestly recommend this combo to ANYONE who wants to potentiate their oxys, 

Guys it's incredible. 
Diphenhydramine and oxycodone are literally two pieces of a two piece puzzle that is wonderful and beautiful, far beyond anything I imagined.

The official proposes that EMS workers should not be dispatched to overdose calls if a victim has already been treated for an opiate overdose more than once. He claims that in 2016 alone, his county responded to 535 opioid-related overdoses, costing the city more than $1.2 million. This proposal would deny taxpayers, the people paying that $1.2 million life saving treatments like narcan, cpr, and hospital stays. He says his proposal was ""Just to scare drug addicts,"" and to save money. If his monetary claims are true, that would mean the city is spending $2,242.99 on average per overdose. My question is, when will the proponants of the war on drugs learn that fear is not an effective motivator in preventing the use of drugs? Jail time, excessive fines, probation, and now certain death are the penalties for addiction, a disease being treated as a crime in the developed world. All this proposition will do, if implemented, is cause more deaths via overdose, worsening the epidemic in Middleton. Countries like Switzerland will literally shoot you up with clean, pure diacetylmorphine (heroin) in a safe medical setting to help ween addicts off of the drug. The opioid epidemic is practically non-existant in Switzerland after this treatment became widespread, meaning it is much more effective to give addicts heroin as treatment than methadone, suboxone, or denying them medical treatment. What do you guys think about these contrasting responses to the opioid epidemic? Let me know in the comments. 

TL;DR: Ohio city councilman proposes to deny overdose victims medical assisstance after second overdose, while the Swiss government gives addicts the option to use clean, pure heroin in a monitored medical setting. ",1499327344.0

I've been off subs for a month, taking kratom intermittently, but now snorting subutex does NADA.

I was on suboxone maintenance for a years after a bad car wreck, taking 8 mg a day of the strips. Then I lost my insurance and had to get off of the subs within a period of only 3 weeks, luckily with the help of Kratom it wasn't a COMPLETE nightmare! 

(Thank Jesus for that Stuff.)

Then 4 weeks later, someone very kind gave me some subutex,(8mg) pills and I snorted 2mg of one to try and get relief as well as some sort of pleasant and euphoric recreational effects (not going to lie.) I've been stressed so judge me all you want...

But NOTHING happened....

At ALL, so  I upped the dose to 3mg and still nothing.

I don't know why this is happening?

Is this Kratom still blocking my opiate receptors? Or does snorting subutex just do very very little in the way of relaxation, euphoria, and stress relief? 

I've read people say that subs can have a good rec value and personally, suboxone has done wonders for my emotional state. But I am surprised that I am getting ZERO anything...

I Really don't want to eat it though. I drink tea everyday and I'll have poppy straw to make tea, so I wanna do something special from the opium I collect.

Exploding

 I inhale but feel high, I'm imploding

Usually immune to charm, in hindsight this should have been more foreboding 

But heart beats mind every time,

At least, every time my heart even beats because mine

Doesn't work without wine or a line

Drugs by design are a comfort

I can't feel shit, I need dope, I need a jumper

I grew up without home, family, love or comfort 

Before I was an addict I would have fell for this drug

Before I felt your kisses and even fell to your touch

I knew it was a disaster bound for itself to destruct

I should have watched you through the glass and just kept on walking

But you know it's in my nature I just kept on talking

I needed to know the real you. Not the ghost you show the world

If only I'd deciphered you're just the ghost of a girl

Living in this fantasy that once we had a family

And life would work out for you and be everything you planned to be

But you're still stuck in boots made of cement and insanity

How can you give me your heart if you don't have one to hand to me

I'm empty handed. Once again. I swore I never planned to be

I chase when you self destruct, I chase you when you ran from me

I'll chase you until my feet are bloody and the only thing that stands is me

I tell you that I love you and you're just not understanding me

I'll scream until I can't talk, make you see how much you mean to me

But you just look at me with dead eyes, tell me to leave,

But I can't walk..

Thanks.

Had to ask here as Bluelight and Drugs Forum etc. aren't letting me sign up due to my use of VPN I think lel.

Anyway, I have poppies growing. Had them growing before, last year, and scored them for the latex/ dried it and shit before i realised i didn't have nearly enough to make it worthwhile. Also, couldn't really be arsed.

It's that time of the year again. I have about..... 20-30 small-medium buds growing (minor). I want to know what I should do with them but there is so many conflicting reports on different sites I have no idea.

I don't have enough to actually cultivate and process a decent amount of opium and I have a room mate who asks me too many questions so I can't really cook shit. But he's going a away for a few days and this is my time.

I think i want to make tea but most recipes seem to use dried pods. So i dunno.

My plan is to just mush up some pods in a blender, get a nice goop. Then brew said goop in water for a while, maybe 20 mins (?) and then strain. Then i shall drink this liquid and hopefully get high.

^ Is the above correct? Or is it a waste of time and should i just blend and eat the fucking things?

A lot of contradictory methods and shit online, i have really no idea.

Oh and my tolerance is very, very low at this point. So I'll use probably like.... 3-5 buds worth right now and drink very slowly. 


But yeah,  ***TL:DR*** I have a small amount of fresh buds - what do?


Thanks.

Used on and off (mostly on, put 1-4 months clean together 3-4x) for ten years, this last run was 14 months or so, gram a day IV, lots of speedballs, goofballs, etc.

Anyways i just found out I have hep c and I read a lot about the jet lag type feeling and I deff have that symptom. Usually when I get clean I get a burst of energy but this time me and my girl are super lethargic, all of the time. No pink cloud here.

Tolerance does not seem to be dropping fast. Got ahold of a couple sub strips last week, took 8mg (started at 1 and worked up) and zero buzz. Also getting nothing out of some supposedly dank kratom from the reddit sub. Idk.

Been working a shitty min wage cooking job (think Waffle House) and my girl waitresses. We both turned 28 this summer and working around a bunch of young kids is frustrating because they have no work ethic but also remind us that we are getting old and...we feel like losers.

Most frustrating is the state of my relationship with my girl of 6 years. Up until this kick we have been the most in love, happy couple. We have kicked together several times and it's always fine. This time, since we both still don't feel 100%, we are super distant towards each other. She is super depressed and it shows. The hepatitis lethargy I'm sure has something to do with it. But I am seriously worried she's falling out of love with me. It's sad that at 28 she is literally all I have to live for. If I lose her, I will use, 10000000%. Call me weak, codependent, whatever. 

There are positives though. Obviously not having to hustle all day and worry and wait is nice. We are going to be able to save some money and buy a car before too long, even on a min wage ""salary"". I did my fafsa and will be finishing my degree soon online. I've gained like 30 pounds which i needed, bad. Sleep is starting to come back with the aid of gabapentin and soma.

Cravings are not too intense because we moved to the middle of nowhere to kick and there is no dope for probably two hours in each direction. During work is when I crave the worst.

If anyone wants to talk they can inbox me. A couple people got clean around the time I did and we stayed in touch but sadly they have all deleted their accounts. I don't care if you are using, kind words mean a lot. Shout out to Tracey and trav3 they both sent me rigs when i was using and more than likely saved me from hiv. I was using needles I found on the ground at one point. My kit included a cocktail of bleach and alcohol and Lysol etc to clean rigs if I had to share. This last run went dark quickly (thanks New Orleans)...to be honest I was kind of expecting to die anytime and at peace with it.

Things have got to get better. The dope will always be there but I owe myself a shot (ha) at a normal life. ",1499434221.0

Not to reddit, not to using opiates, just to this sub. I made a special throwaway 'cause reasons.

For me, it all started back in 08' when my friend's boyfriend/my coke dealer gave me an oxy for my 16th birthday. I had also just gotten a job as a ski instructor and my boyfriend at the time was sponsored. Good skiers sometimes get into bad accidents that require major surgeries and result in an abundance of fantastic painkillers, especially back then. So you know the drill.

Did some bad girl things to keep the habit going at the suggestion of some even worse guys for 2 years then got clean for 2 years then got back into pills after getting my wisdom teeth out and woke up one day after vomiting in my sleep and was clean for like 2 more years until becoming a stripper, getting back into pills, and into heroin not long after that. It's been another ~2 years now, since then my longest continuous period of time not using h was 5 months, but I was still doing Percocet, hydros, and codeine fairly regularly. And benzos always, for a decade +.

Anyway, I ended things a couple weeks ago with the dboy I was kinda havin a thing with a) because my ex who doesn't use H but does fuck with other opiates wants to get back together and I still like him, and b) I think that dboy was tryna pimp me out or something because he invited me down to Vegas and my hella paranoid sex worker sensors went off. 😣

Now that that dude and I aren't talking anymore tho, I know myself well enough that I need somewhere/someone/someplace to commiserate regarding this whole opiate addiction thing, so here I am on the internet. Muuuuch better than straight kickin' it with whichever dboy is in my life which has naturally caused some major problems with my man in the past, (even when it really really is *just* getting high and talking). 😒

Since I started using h 3 years ago I haven't been the same caliber of junkie trainwreck I was in high school so I like to think I know my limits and know how to handle my shit much better now. That said, I recently took a month off from h because my man said he'd buy us a bunch of 30's if I layed off h for a week, which was fucking wack but also successful. Unfortunately, after a couple weeks my Percocet tolerance got stupid high and doing them was no longer cost effective.

So thus begins the cycle again, literally cannot wait to get off work from my day job today so I can go see my new dope guy. Tbh I know my man will not be happy but he was cracking jokes about me coughing up tin foil on 4th of July so like, it's not like he'll be surprised.

That's what my phone tells me how long it's been since I shoved a needle into the vein of my hand. I did it on my hand because I remember I was too dehydrated to register from the crook of my arm where my favourite vein was all bruised up, hard like a rock. So I have the shot ready, syringe between my teeth. I check each hands to see that the vein from the right hand bounced back stronger than the left. I wrapped the tourniquet around my right wrist.

Bevel's up. Needle goes in. Plunger pulls back. Blood seeps into the syringe. I hold the needle in place while my teeth pulls off the tourniquet. Plunger pushes in. Plunger pushes in smoothly. Not a single bit missed.

""This is it.""

""That was it.""

Then I go for another wash of the cotton and what's left on the surface of the cooker. Barely anything, but I found myself smiling when I saw that the water had a beige tint to it.

This time, I go for a different vein. Although the syringe was filled up to 30 or 40 units, I use the vein that never fails me. The one that's on the other side of the forearm where I can't see, but if I fold the arm, I can feel it. I don't want to miss a single bit of that last, last shot.

```

My last shot was in the men's bathroom of John F. Kennedy airport Terminal 1. It was July 4th 8:30pm when I walked out of that bathroom feeling the rush, tasting the rush in the back of my throat. I threw out the last needle and the last used alcohol pad into the trash bag while I made a short eye contact with the janitor. He, with other people in the bathroom passed by in a short second minding their own businesses; No one had any idea how fast my heart was pounding. I pull out from the pocket--my little secret; the half empty blue distilled water container and the used cooker squeezed in my tiny fist dropped into the translucent plastic bag.

I wash my hands, I wash the blood off, and as always, I pull my lower eyelid down to check how pinned my pupils are. It's just something I do routinely. But I knew this was the last routine pupil-check I would do until I step on the ground of this land of the free, home of the brave, again. I know I'll slip and fall again--somehow I know that this won't be the last shot of heroin of my life.

Just about a week or two ago, I was using three to four bags of ECP a day. I tapered to half a bag, twice a day by the day before my departure. I was proud of myself. So I scraped off all the glassine bags with a metro card and washed all the used cotton I could find. I had a bag left on top of that, so I decided to reward myself.

I had been marking the time when I shot up, and wrote it down on my journal. I even included how many hours it passed since the shot before what I wrote.

How ironic--it was the last page of my journal pad, and I was running out of space to write the time down.

```

These were the things that I had to help my WD less painful.

Clonidine, Klonopin, Gabapentin, Loperamide, and a tiny bit of kratom.

I went through the first 24 hours of withdrawal 30,000 feet high up in the sky. Time is now nonexistent in my life at the moment. The only time that I can count on is the sobriety clock.

I've had so many different times in my life that I've called ""rock bottom"", I've done so many fucked up things in the name of not being sick,  I've had plenty of the fun there is to have, and I've quit only to relapse a bunch of times. But I think the thing that sucks the most is that for the last year or more I've had no one to partake in this vice with me. Not a friend nor a girlfriend that gives you comfort through the ongoing struggle of hating your life as a user. 

As my use has gotten worse and with me no longer working at the neighborhood bar, I've started to see a lot fewer of the people that I used to see, a lot of people I considered friends. With that I've been left to the few people that still reach out to me and coworkers. I feel like these days I hardly see anyone any more. All of the friends in my neighborhood have either left or don't really talk to me. Other than that, since I'm aways struggling with money, it's hard to see the few willing people; but I don't even know if that's really the worse.

Over the last two years I've had two short ""relationships"" that came to their inevitable demise.   Besides those I've had very little luck at dating even though it had never been a problem for me before. I find myself lonely many nights and very jealous every time I'm out and I see couples (which is almost all the time). As time has gone on, I've started to feel less and less desirable, which has only made things harder. I just want honest and compassionate love from someone. And even though I want to quit, every time I try, as I get sick, all I can think about is all these horrible thoughts and how I don't want to be alone....And I end up just using again.

I'm not silly enough to say that my dboy's past shit wasn't cut a bit too; but I've been researching a bit and it seems to make sense that it was mostly heroin before. I'm going to order a test kit online.. hopefully Bunk Police or Dance Safe have some that can distinguish purer heroin from straight fent (although I dunno how this would work seeing as most of the time they're cut with both, not sure what the color would turn to on the test for a mix, if at all). 

My last dope from him was a nice light brown/tan and the last time I tried it (3 weeks ago) he agreed to  charge me a bit more more to hook me up with the ""uncut"" (less cut, how he gets it before he adds his own cut) smack. It was a beautiful small grayish rock (much less brown than before; he said it was some sort of sleeping med he cuts with, possibly Dormil I suppose but he never clarified).

After a 3 week break from opiates I picked up a point today and this shit is real white now, with a yellowish tint and lacks the euphoria and energy of the last product I got. My research leads me to believe it's fent (Jesus... hopefully not carfentanyl; I know I'm playing Russian Roulette either way though).

It's much stronger at lower doses (then wears off quickly leaving me with only the sedation) and while I know it could be my drop of tolerance, I know it's not only that. I literally only took super super super small bumps to test it (each bump spaced over a few hours) and they floooooored me. I snort all my dope. This stuff is way different than anything from him I've used.

Background: I've only been experimenting with dope for about 3 or 4 months, but opiates in general for 3 and a half years or so.


QUESTION:
I know it's smart to take all precautions with Narcan and whatnot, but I'm a complete amateur and I need some advice (besides to stop now... I know that'd be smart too).

HOW CAN I ENJOY A NOD?! I've never really taken enough of super potent opiates these past years to actually nod, but these small bumps of this new dope every few hours has got me to a point where I'm nodding harrrrd. It's not too intense (I puked a bit today from it however) but I want to nod and not get scared that I'm dying or OD'ing.

I know I sound like a dumbass and I feel like it's not worth it to even gamble. But it seems like many people enjoy nods, and I definitely feel like I'm not about to OD right now after my last bump 30 minutes ago.

I keep nodding and dozing off and then I abruptly wake up, get scared as shit to actually nod/lose a bit of conscious. For a second some of the times (when coming back to), I feel like a lot more time has gone by and I forget where I am for about a second when coming back. Even though I just nodded out for maybe 2-5 seconds.

What other ways can I ensure safe nodding besides what I mentioned? Like I said, I usually have always done opiates only to the point of getting energy (socially and mentally), not really nodding. But I'd like to enjoy it. And now I'm fucking with the devil since I know this shit has all the signs of the first fent I've ever gotten. I'd just like to be safe and enjoy a nod if I can.

What are true and non-OD nods actually like? Fine line I'm sure. I'm so afraid to fall asleep just because I've never experienced real nods. Do you actually lose consciousness for a few moments and keep coming back? Or is it aimed to be a consistent, controllable feeling? I feel like I'd just fall asleep but I keep waking up and enjoying the high after little freak outs and a bit of a nausea. 

Sorry for the amateur question, I know I sound ignorant and silly but I'm an isolated user that has no one IRL to ask. Just want to actually enjoy nods for once and not fear for my life the whole time, but I know that's a SERIOUS concern. I just hear of a lot of people knowing they'll nod and knowing when they're close to OD and even death.

So we left off with me quitting drugs for a minute on my own, for no reason other than I wanted a clear head. Also, and something I will always remember, me and my father made our peace. We went from fighting everyday, to honestly best friends nowadays. Me and him have had so many lil business ventures and shit sense then. I love the shit out of him, and almost respect him more for all the times we threw toes. I had also just graduated, and met a new chick. We decided to buy a trailer home, and I decided that I would use the freakin master bedroom to grow pot. 

For a while it was all good, we grew pot and got little shit jobs in our little shit town. Eventually though, we got in on a Oxy hook. Started slinging that too, but my girl started wanting to do them first. And I immediately was like *word I've been waiting for you to ask*.

However, this was around the time I started getting told about cops watching me, and could plainly see them do so. My neighbors in the park have always been hella tight with me (essential when growing at home) and let me know every other day ""hey piggies where pointing some thing (FLIR) at your house for like a half hour.""

The cops in my town are idiots though. They would follow me in the same three vehicles, and so many times I tried to flag them down. Anybody who knows me would tell you that I fucking hate cops, I mean I used to go out and spray paint their cars as a teen. Even as a little kid I looked up to people like Lenin and shit. But that's for a different subbb. Needless to say I was getting frustrated at them. But eventually I had to kill every plant. I whipped them up into hash as quick as I could one night. Then I got rid of all the evidence that it was pot I was growing. I stashed the hash out at a buddies house, then waited for a few weeks. It was a grueling wait, because the whole time I was like ""oh shit man wtf what if you killed them for nothing?"" But eventually they did raid my ass. At like 5 am in the morning and they didn't find shit! Not shit! Not even a fucking pipe. No pills, just an angry and tired boyfriend and girlfriend. By the time they left I was literally laughing in their faces, and to this day I am so fucking proud of that moment. One of the few I got I can hold onto lmfao. Because shortly after that some off duty cop fucked with me at a gas station and I just sorta had a breakdown. I freaked out at him and had a knife the whole time, but I quickly came too. I had a really good lawyer, quite possibly the best in my town, and spent a good chunk of my time in a mental health facility. 

When I got out, I found out my girl had turned into a heroin addict. And that she had cheated on me at least once. I was so fucking broken man. I couldn't break it off with her though, I was just so in love ya know? Like I had found my soul mate but she shit on me. Eventually though I cheated on her, and started doing Heroin as well. (one time a lesbian literally sucked on my dick like she was trying to get a tootsie pop off the stick). 

For the first time in my life I think, I was truly more sad than angry. But as one damn good therapist put it, when men get sad many just express that outwardly as more anger. This was the first period of my life that I was 100% junkie. I went on drinking binges. I started doing heroin every day via smoking (never any other way). 

I ended up finding a D-girl who was super reliable. Never any of the huge long waits we are **all** accustomed too. Just straight up, come on over I'm weighing it now. She was legit as fuck. But she got kicked out of her place, and me and my girl made the decision that she could move in for some rent every month.

So here I am. I got my hands on 30mg of oxy. I crushed one, snorted it, and just laid down and waited for it to kick in. Here, 20 mins later or so, there's clearly some calming effects, but nowhere near that nodding in and out of consciousness, the feeling of a warm blanket all over my body, and not being able to think about anything for more than 3 seconds at a time.

Addiction has been and still is a big problem for me. I still use and still enjoy it, I'm not going to lie to anyone and pretend that I don't. My psychiatrist is aware of this, and though they don't exactly agree, they accept that it's my life and they're understanding enough to work around it.

I'm on a bunch of other legit medications now too that do an awful lot to help keep me level.

Anyway I could ramble on about my shit for days.... I mainly just wanted to put it out there and see if anyone else wanted to chip in and talk in a safe place about addiction in mental health? Either your own experiences, or care for loved ones, or just ask questions in general.

A lot of people suffer with MH problems and co-morbid substance addiction/misuse is very common among those that do, hence why I thought this could be a good place to talk and ask questions if you're interested?

I for one have a lot of experience as I'm sure do many of you do so let's have a convo...

(As a treatment professional),"Many of you saw my last post thanking you all for unknowingly helping me through my education in Addiction Studies. I wanted to ask you all, What should I know? Whats going on in the opiate addicts world? What effects you most? 

I read a recent story about fake Percs in GA. I found that fascinating, and wasted no time sending the article out to all of my co-workers. I feel that part of my career and responsibility is educating those I work alongside about drugs, addiction and current events.

I openly hold views that all drugs should be legalized, and more often now I find my co-workers are starting to agree with me, or are at least willing to hear me out on my own out look of addiction theory. I have a theory that is largely based on societal and legal contexts in combination with the Biopsychosocial Model of addiction. I'm not completely sold on the disease model of addiction. I feel that labeling someone as an addict for life may be more detrimental in the long term scope of life and self-concept. 

Any ways back on topic. What news or information do you want substance abuse professionals to know more about? What would hold the most impact? I want to wake people up and show them whats really going on in the addiction and addiction treatment world. 

Another side note, We're (The people I work with/for) well aware of the Florida Shuffle stories, and while I do live in Florida I work for a more reputable company that has taken great measures to ensure we're not, and none of the people we work with are taking part in selling bodies to treatment mills for profit.

I knew I absolutely needed change or I was/am going to kill myself. I got accepted into treatment (state-funded) , starting on 7/28/17. 

I just had a couple of questions: as far as detoxing goes, I know everyone is different, how long did you spend in detox and/or do you suspect one can spend in detox ? Do you recommend inpatient/outpatient care? I have a shit load of responsibilities, like moving, bills, etc. I kinda wanna do detox and outpatient care. Get tf out as early as I can.

Also open to ANY recommendations. Ill be going to god damn Cenikor in Austin Texas.

No time or distance between us can ever keep her allure at Bay

She's hurt me so many times that you'd think it so very easy to choose

Who else but a mad man would continually slip beneath her noose

But this bond of ours is so complex that it goes deep into my core

I seem to push aside the bad things even as the warm tears start to pour

I make excuses for her downsides and glorify how we got along

This twisted love I have for her makes me see the bright side never her wrong

I've taken her back again and in no time I find

She's got my soul once again was it ever really mine?

A brief prick of pain quickly forgotten as her sweet bliss finds its way up stream

No feeling this phenomenal can be anything but a dream

How wrong I am again I scream inside my head, betraying my blissful stare.

I've let that bitch heroin back in, now here comes an all too familiar nightmare

I love her and I hate her and of that  I am so sure

Oh what I wouldn't give to have never even  met her or to truly find a cure

I heard opiates were the shit. My plan was to spread it out as far as possible to make it last really long. But I had to try it out for the first time. I took 2 and I was flying. The world was perfect, my anxiety gone, I was a new outgoing, loving, and fun person. Life was warm and everything was going to be more than okay. Of course the next day I wanted to feel it again so I did it again. For some reason, I didn't feel as good so I took more, but still didn't get to where I was the first day. I wanted to feel it again. 

The third day, I take a larger dose of 25mg. My reasoning was that I would save the rest but at least go out with a bang. Again, I'm flying. The world is a wonderful place and I'm a wonderful person and so is everyone else. I heard I wasn't supposed to use three days in a row so I refrained from taking it the day after that, but all throughout the day, I kept remembering it. I kept thinking about it. I wanted to feel it again. Maybe I hadn't gotten as high as I could. I wanted to feel the highest possible high that that I could feel. Even though I told myself I wouldn't, I took more that night and again, everything was great. For a little while. I redosed but it didn't do much. 

I woke up feeling unsatisfied. I keep using more and more and I'm not really getting the same effect. I want to know the highest point I could get. Plus, four days  of continuous use surely would have made it less effective. I couldn't take anymore, or I would risk building a tolerance and I'd just be wasting drugs. 

Sure enough, all day I kept thinking about getting high and feeling at least how I did the first night. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I honestly couldn't. That's when I realized that I went through almost all of what I had gotten. I only have one more dose left. And boy do I want to take it so badly. Usually I'm a very in control person. I put so much acetaminophen into my body, but I didn't care. Usually I'm super concerned about my health.  I have no idea what happened this week. Like damn, it's only been a week. I thought I had more self control than that. Honestly, I'm kind of scared. But more than that, I want to do it again. 

Thanks for reading. I guess I just wanted to get it all off my chest. But I am surprised by how much I justified and literally ignored the lines I drew. Has anyone else felt this way?",1499523819.0
6m174o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6m174o/my_life_pt3/,35,https://redd.it/6m174o,OrneryDude,My life (pt3),"We left off with me and my fellow junkie girlfriend letting our dgirl move in with us. We did this under the premise that she would give us $250 a month, which would have at least paid a bill or two. She's about 10 years older than me and 6 years older than my girl.  

So dgirl moves in and at first things were going great. For the first few months, she not only paid the small amount she said, but she had all sorts of goodies for us to try. LSD (not the research chemically shit I had had), cocaine (its an okay high), meth (fucking hated it after about an hour an a half my girl loved it though), even had some weird ass ""designer drugs"" sometimes. I haven't done a single psych since doing some weirdo shit she had. Fuck designer drugs boys n girls, at least the 'trippy' kind. 

I was in a weird place. I absolutely could no longer sell drugs. I was always trading them to her for dope, and usually doing the dope with her and my girlfriend. She would usually do some with me and her too. We had a lot of good ass times, and even had a couple threesomes, but they were usually more of me watching them bang than anything else lmfaooo. I would usually just tucker out eventually knowing I wouldn't cum. Also I wasn't at all into smoking meth like they were hahaha. Like damn I didn't really care at all at the time, but looking back its more like *I* was the one rooming with *them* if you get what I'm saying. 

By the winter of the year she moved in, no one in that house had a job. My pretty casual first home had turned into a full on trap/flop house. I no longer sold drugs, but at one point I was flipping dozens of fucking video games on facebook that I lifted from the local stores. I was breaking into storage sheds like the most fucked up version of Storage Wars you have ever seen lmfao, just praying something in these fuckers was valuable (fuck no! haha). I won't get into what my girl was doing, but I'm sure ya'll can imagine. She still swears up and down she never banged any dudes, but she would never tell me how she got cash. I eventually quit asking lmfao (the glories of being a junky)

Dgirl's $250 a month turned into half heroin (for mostly me) and half meth (for all my girl and dgirl). That shit would last two days at the most and then it was right back to hunting. I don't think any one of us in that house even genuinely *remembered* how much in bills we had to pay.

I don't know if any of you have had the pleasure of living in a house **full** of junkies. But it is endless drama, Me and my girl fought because of how often she fucked Dgirl and me accusing her of hoe'in (lmfao its not a cuck if I get heroin right.... right!??). Eventually once, after my girl had threatened me with a knife and deadass hit me with my own car, Dgirl let slip ""quit being a crazy bitch I'm trying to sleep."" This relatively innocuous and obvious statement would forever alter the dynamic in that shit house. 

Now, when I would get home from a hard nights *work* I would no longer come home to the two of them screwing. It as now too those two yelling. Although my girl would swear up and down she never stole shit, Dgirl was losing all kinds of meth and other shit. I know she didn't just lose it in the house, because you bet your ass I looked for it lmfao. 

For that whole year I avoided my old man at all costs. He was a hard ass dude, and I didn't think he would be very sympathetic if he found out what I was doing in the trailer he sold me. Nevermind what I was putting into my body! But sometime in the Spring, I think around April, he found me in walmart. The look on his face made me choke the fuck up, it still does today remembering it. Just a look of disgust, fear, and anger all wrapped in one (why am I describing this to you lot?lmfao yall know). 

He didn't beat my ass right there in walmart, he didn't even call me out. He gave me a big ass hug right there. The first words out of his mouth where, ""I missed you boy."" He told me to follow him out to his car, and he gave me a shit ton of Subs. The way he described it it would last me about two weeks (I think he assumed I had been shooting because it lasted me FOREVER lmfao) and he told me to come by even if I threw those away when I got home (if anything I would have sold them pops cmon). 

I started those subs that day, because I didn't want to relive that moment of disappointment ever again (hahahhahahaa rich right?). Dgirl went nuts when I told her she had to pay me in cash instead of drugs now. And my girl and me broke up, but I didn't kick her out (We remain pretty close friends to this day). I got a real job! After I had gotten three checks we realized just how much we owed in back lot space and other bills. 

The total was over 2 grand lmfao. Which at the very least neither I or my girl turned roomie had seen in a long fuckin time. We all sat down and talked for hours about how we were gonna get out of this debt before we got booted out. Lmfao like hours of heart to hearts and little motivational speeches for each other. No shit I snuck out of there that fucking night lmfaoooo. I moved to a somewhat larger town about four hours away with my Dad's help. And he agreed to go over and have them get the trailer signed in their names. After keeping in touch with the girl who was ""my"" girl she told me how the rest went.

So she said that after I left they freaked the fuck out haha. But ended up pulling some kind of scam and saving their asses. Her and dgirl were cool again for a minute, but it lasted maybe one month. None of us ever cleaned, and where so dazed that we never noticed a small leak under the sink. The mother fucking floor in the kitchen fell out while dgirl was walking on it, she ended up getting a gnarly ass cut on her leg and going to the hospital that day. 

So my ex girl thought about her situation. SHe reasoned that a trailer with a gigantic floor right in the middle would take money to fix. Money she didn't want to spend on a fucking floor! She decided the wisest thing was for her to just steal all of dgirl's shit and dip the fuck out too (too her sisters or cousin or something). Me and that girl (mine not dgirl) will likely always be at least friends. We were just the two scummiest people in that whole town lmfaoo. I see her a lot still actually, and we text pretty regularly. 

Pt 4 Will probably be a little underwhelming after reading this pile of shit lmfao

Cambodia is really chill. Everyone is trying to get one up on you but theres a lot of poverty so thats to be expected. I've seen some gnarley people with im pretty sure lepresy.

I got on that plane finally after having avoided it for so long, and the craziest thing is, I'm still not sure why I did it. I burned everything out like a dwarf star, but I could still keep bullshitting everyone I'm sure, still find a way to keep taking them and continue to be with her after 10 years(plus my cats). 

Now I'm in this arid hellhole with nothing, not even her, sitting like some lonely curiosity in a Mexican bar. Subconsciously I know what it was, I finally wanted a chance at something else, at a future of being happy. The issue I've come to now though is, what was the point of sacrificing everything when I'll return to nothing? 

As a piece of advice, casino's will make you feel insane while in withdraws. There is recreational bud now though.

But he was describing a hot bag to me as one the dealers will make extremely potent on purpose whether it's uncut or cut with fent. Give it as a freebie with the hope of purposely ODing the tester so the local junkies hear bout such n such a stamp and actively search it out. 


Now I'm not dumb I realiZe junkies do in fact want the strongest
Shot they can get without dying but has anyone ever heard of dealer intentionally causing an OD or atleast hoping To cause an OD to drum up business. 

His second point to this is it's only the one bag that was fire the rest are stepped on to shit but it only takes the 1 OD report to bring the masses to the area. And then they sell stepped on dirt to make a huge profit. 


Idk I know this is a fucked up game but it's just sad to think people would intentionally do that on the off chance they sel a few more bags...tell me humanity hasn't slipped that far down the well

DAYS OF DARKNESS

&nbsp;


Chapter: ""Here...but I'm gone""

""If I took the time to replace

&nbsp;

What my mind erased

&nbsp;

I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone""


&nbsp;

Fucking roofing tar, yeah that what this batch of dope looks like. Those pieces or tar I'd find on the ground while the paisa's on the block would be doing someones roof when I was a kid. I hated the smell of that shit, and stepping in it was a bitch and a half... because they would spill that shit everywhere.  Now if I was to see a small chunk of it on the ground I'd probably pick it up, hoping some dboy was just slipping.
What a joke...

&nbsp;

Because everyone just finds chunks of unwrapped black tar heroin on the ground right?  I laugh at the thought of this, knowing damn well my luck has never been that good, but we can always dream, can't we?

&nbsp;


Lately, dreaming and real sleep have both eluded me like I was trying to collect a debt. Which really isn't far from the reality, because this Insomnia has been fuckin me over for years.  I miss those vivid and deep lucid dreams that feel so real you can taste the dope, smell the sweat of sex in the air, and are immersed in another reality. The dreams that you wake up and question the concept of ""reality"" those 3D-cinematic-8.1 HD Dolby surround sound-dreams....yeah, those.

&nbsp;


Now I just settle for my daydreams of a different life and getting lost inside of a blissful nod when blessed with it. The dead calm that comes over me when I'm nodding into a trance is one of the best forms of mental peace I know. While altered states of consciousness can be achieved through non-narcotic induced methods like meditation...it's not half as fun as chasing down some dope, coppin it and locking myself away from the world. That first class ticket on the next thing smokin to the land of Noddingham.
The chase, and the high itself of course are part of the overall rush that comes with doing dope. This isn't true for everyone, but I know plenty that would agree.

&nbsp;



I sit on the toilet and shake the bottle gently, twist the cap off and then dump out another pile of brown sugar onto the bathroom counter, which becomes a sanctuary within my sanctuary. The label on the bottle has been scraped away quite some time ago, and light brown stains formed odd-shaped circular patterns around it..all from my filthy hands.  At times my fingertips would be just disgusting, stained and sticky from the tar, a darkened yellowish stain remains that I wouldnt bother to wash away. The outside of this bottle practically has my fingerprints in heroin all over it. A few black smudges are on the cap's edges..which came from the bottom of the foil I was using to smoke some of this batch with. If this bottle could talk, it sure would have one hell of a  tale to tell.

&nbsp;

A few quarters rattle around inside the bottle, used to help smash the clumps of rock hard black tar into a powder. To convert solid tar heroin into a powder, you need something to mix it with such as clabbergirl baking powder or lactose...I prefer clabber, but lactose works and has a sweeter taste, to each his own.

&nbsp;


I take a few more bumps, now using a tar stained train ticket to shovel it to my nose. .my head feels light and the sound of the rain relaxes me..

&nbsp;


"" fuck off depression and anxiety"" case I've got Lady Heroin on my side right now...and we're doing just fine together

&nbsp;


I drift off into another nod, and reality melts away and I enjoy the melted puddle of bliss I have slipped into...

&nbsp;




3:33 am...another day of doing dope begins. The rains continues to pour outside and its slightly soothing, the sound of the drops hitting my windows brings back memories of when I was living in my car when I was homeless...my address was 1987 Civic Dr, the cross street was Honda and it was a lonely road.

&nbsp;



When it would rain, the sound of it would put me to sleep and keep me there peaceful as a fuckin baby. Literally with almost nothing but hope to my name. Id enjoy some od the little things that make me happy to get through the depression

&nbsp;


I'd smoke a joint after Id parked my car on this one street with had a view of the ocean. Listening to the rain, while watching the waves crash against the rocks and getting high was how I would end my day. I try to conjure up that part of me now but it's just too far gone...it was a simple bliss that seemed so easy to find. At time I look back and realize some of the happier times in my life where when I had the least.


&nbsp;


I've spent too many years trying to forget things to now stop to try and remember some...


&nbsp;


In my mind, those were the times where life just stood still, the voices in my heads all quieted down and I could actually have a peaceful conversation with myself. To some, that statement makes no sense, but to others it's understood because crazy speaks crazy. 

&nbsp;

I look around and see one of my old photo albums and begin to flip through it searching for a tale to tell. I see faces of folks from different era's in my life...some dead, some alive...but most have lost contact and are out there somewhere in the world. I see smiles from happier times, old girlfriends that put up with my young 'n dumb self, and flyers from concerts, promotions, record release partys and albums that I've been a part of. In another life I dreamed of being a musician since I loved to write lyrics and was pretty good at it from what I've been told.
I think I sold all of my untapped potential for dope at some point.

&nbsp;


Countless pictures of me waving stacks of cash at the camera (I always laugh at these because I really thought I was cool in those pics.. holding up a measly $1200.00 in twenty dollar bills, really thinking I was living large..)

Simple reminders of the days when all I would do is sell whatever was needed and get high..fast and easy money made when I was young and dumb (but still swore that I knew it all)  That was before I made the switch to a legal avenue for income and began a semi legit life, in other words, when I became a tax paying citizen and grew the fuck up just a little.


&nbsp;

I was able to corner the market in my neighborhood and was known for having the best shit and biggest bags. It was all just customer service in the end, the sacks sold themselves but it was the way I treated people that made the difference. They weren't just customers I made them feel like friends even if I barely knew them..but this was also a different scene back then.... I was young and thought I was untouchable, and the circle of associates that were with me were ones I could trust. I look back into my own eyes in these photos and just see a soul that was still somewhat naive to what the world had in store for me....if I only knew.

&nbsp;


With this project I am attempting to create somewhat of a time line of my life, something to leave behind in this world that helps people understand my life. At the same time this will help me understand myself, and see the damage and pain that some decisions have caused others. These chapters I write are like my form of attending N/A meetings...and I appreciate you giving me a moment of your time to take a tour of my memories and allowing me to share at this meeting

I have a drug screening on Monday for a new job. I quit weed 2 months ago, and decided to get some test kits just to make sure I was pissing clean.

I took two tests today and both of which tested negative for THC. However, both tested positive for opiates. Only opiate I've ever taken was Vicodin for my wisdom teeth removal 8 years ago.

I have eaten one Everything Bagel (which has poppy seeds) every day for the last three days. Are my test kits messed up or will a fucking bagel cause me to lose my job?! Thanks in advance for your help.

6lwqpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6lwqpb/tolerance_question/,6,https://redd.it/6lwqpb,ThrowItAway0814,Tolerance question,"So I've been using opiates for about 2 and a half years now. Shatter with an kccasionql perc 10 one or twice a week and then moved up to a 30 every now and then (as in 2-3 times a week tops followed ny a week plus break). I think moved onto opanas where i could typically break it into 4ths for a dose and then it moved to halves.

I tried it a few times within 2 years but nothing serious. Maybe 1 hit randomly once a week and then 3 hits or so on an occasional holiday.

About about a year ago i had heavy digestive problems and couldn't eat without extreme pain and vomiting. I switched to perc 20's which i was using about once a day for a week straight. Eventually i moved up to 60 millis a day about once or twice a week.

After the cost became too high i switched exclusively to dope. I can pretty much maintain 1 hit and maybe a bit more a day and make it last about a week or a little more. I usually only use like this for a full week or two and then stop for a week or two.

So my question is, willl this path completely fuck me up when it comes to addiction? I've already noticed that days when i run out i tend to feel a bit nauseous and have no appetite but that's not unusual for me on a good day.

So am I doing alright using with regular breaks in between or am I gonna be fucked?",1499462033.0

The sense of solidarity I saw here among the people talking to each other, even though I never really posted myself, gave me a lot of solace and helped through some very dark times when I had isolated myself from anyone in my day to day life due to using. 
Reading all the crazy fucking stories, the dope porn, people getting sober, people relapsing, made me feel slightly less insane <3

When my PA went thru, instead of the pharmacy filling the 59- they filled the 60 leaving my last refill with 59. NOW when I went to fill this months rx (59 left) they were out of stock so they gave me a partial fill of 10 leaving me with 49 to pickup the next day when they got their delivery.  When I went to pick up the rest of the rx(49)- the evening Pharmacist was there who I'm guessing didn't know I had a picked up a partial fill of 10. He ended up filling the full 59. *Glitch in the system* I'm thinking since this months initial refill was already a partial (59) they weren't able to record ANOTHER partial (49.)  Curious if anyone has any input  about pharmacy protocol when something like this happens. Its a major 24hour pharmacy/store chain.  I'm most likely going to give them back just bc I believe in karma and too, I've been using this pharm for 5 years and its bad enough I'm prob judged for having a rx for suboxone to begin with. 

What would you do? The pharmacy can't be 100% positive that I even counted them when I got home. They can assume or speculate but not prove. I really thought they would've called by now.

6lvt1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6lvt1y/weird_experience_asleep_standing_up_dreaming/,13,https://redd.it/6lvt1y,GilbertGreat,"WEIRD experience. Asleep standing up, dreaming while awake. Anyone else?","Last night took 50mg hydro and 10mg valium. I have a decent tolerance, but have never used any opiate more powerful than hydro. I also potentiated beforehand with 50mg benadryl (diphen), 40mg RXM, 600mg tagamet (cimetidine), and of course the old classic: grapefruit juice. 

Now usually opiates wake me the hell up and I stay up all night, super energized, social. I usually feel really ""present."" Almost more normal than me when I'm sober, actually. This was my first time potentiating with RXM and Benadryl. I know that stuff makes you sleepy. And I might have taken too much Benadryl.

So basically after a while, I started having some audio hallucinations. Like hearing people talking nearby. And I didn't really have visual ""hallucinations,"" but sometimes things would seem to kind of flash into my field of view. 

What was REALLY weird was that I started involuntarily falling asleep while standing up, trying to do things. It was like anytime my brain wandered, I would start dreaming IMMEDIATELY and then snap myself out of it when I started to fall (I was standing). Twice I started dreaming and falling asleep standing while trying to pee. And I kept trying to stay focused, but this happened again like 5 times as I just tried to leave the bathroom! I almost fell into my tub. 

The other weird thing was that because I was in this half-dream state, I kept responding to things people would say in these ""dreams."" Every time I started to speak to someone out loud, I would snap out of it. I probably said 15 different things to different people who were all actually nobody at all. What the hell????

Here's the kicker: I was never even able to leave the bathroom, though I kept trying. Judging by some info I got from my text message time stamps and what time I remember waking up at, I'm 90% sure that I fell asleep standing up in my bathroom for 2 hours.

Is it possible to sleep standing up? How did I not fall? Does anyone have any experience with this, or with starting half-dream conversations before ""waking up"" and realizing you're talking to nobody?

I'll do my best to keep future posts more succinct unless they're stories.**


No, this is not a post to brag about me having friends off the web. Some of them have a better track record of being positive influences than others. Some of them can have volumes written about them, their exploits and/or their immediate family.

**THE TL;DR is closer to the bottom if you wish to skip the backstory.**

If anyone would like to hear a story about a friend who is somewhat lazy, arguably selfish, and has stolen from me before yet managed to earn forgiveness then please let me know because this is not who or what I am writing about right now..

&nbsp; 

The crux of this post is about one specific friend. We go wayyyy back. We don't hang out all too frequently these days but we keep in touch and a couple of years ago he moved into a place with his family that isn't too far from where I live so I was bound to cross paths with him from time to time and catch up. My mom allays loved this kid when we were in our late teens/early 20s because he'd always act extra sweet to her. Sometimes he'd compliment her ""feng shui"" jeans, and other times would just put up good conversation to brake the monotony of life. My friend smokes cigarettes and my mom was a smoker until she stopped smoking for health reasons years prior to her death. When my friend asked to bum a single cigarette from my mom she didn't think twice about giving him three or four for the road. Point is that he's a pretty good friend and my mom liked him even if she didn't like the fact that we'd sometimes get stoned together on good ol' fashioned weed.

&nbsp;

We'll call my friend **Tom**. Tom is a good friend even despite past tribulations. First time I smoked when I Was 14 was with him. Boy did we get stupid stoned that time and it was fucking regs. The amount of times I cut class and went to his house during my freshman year of high school was quite excessive. By the time I Was 18 we would smoke in his garage with a cast of characters usually four of us in total but there were guest appearances and absences for a couple of those years thereafter.

&nbsp; 

Tom is a good friend but it would be fair to highlight the worst things he's ever done to me. Tom has never stolen from me, so as far as I'm concerned he never did anything requiring forgiveness. There was a time where I'd have to be at work on Tuesdays at 7 AM after getting three hours of sleep. Later in the evening of those Tuesdays I would be in Tom's garage smoking blunts with him and two to four other folks. One of our other friends who was a guest appearance but was  a staple to the group for about three months was named Gio. Gio was a ""tough guy"" type who would sometimes use smaller less assertive souls like myself at the time to boost their mood. Through pranks, general disrespect, and deprecating statements. Hanging with folks like Gio is probably why I honed and refined my self deprecating humor. A girl I was dating observed my use of such humor and it got me thinking. I'm glad she pointed it out because it has served me in good steed to this day. Sometimes I want  to use self-deprecating humor to diffuse tension or bring joy to those around me and I will think before speaking and not do so. This has surely helped me get laid and allowed me to maintain a higher level of respect among my peers. 

&nbsp;

Okay, so about the worst things I can think of Tom doing to me. One time I was falling asleep on the garage couch after smoking a blunt as it was a Tuesday night when Tom woke me up by blowing Newport cigarette smoke directly into my face. Gio was sometimes a prick so he certainly wasn't gonna stop Tom from engaging in such antics. Then there was Marv. Marv was like Tom but I didn't know him for as long. One time Tom and Marv got their hands on my old Nokia phone and made it say ""Cock is sweet"" on the screen every time I turned it on. No big deal. Another time I had a Blackberry that had all of my passwords stored on it and if you open up the password list app it would give you 10 tries for the master password. After the 7th failed attempt it would warn you that after three more tries it would erase all of the passwords. For security reasons I decided to call Tom and Marv's bluff and not give them the master password. This resulted in the list being erased. 

&nbsp;

Worst things Tom ever was directly involved in doing was:

* Blowing cig smoke in my face while I'm sleeping on his couch sitting upright after a long restless day.

* Making my Nokia say ""Cock is sweet"" on the screen whenever I turned it on.

* Erasing the password list on my Blackberry.

&nbsp;

Back to Gio being the tough guy prick. It was weird for me, a pretty toxic friendship. He wasn't a prick all the time but enough so that I can remember negative shit. Sometimes I'd reach a boiling point and snap in my own way which would result in me being called out for being the asshole. Perhaps projection, I'd say mainly bad timing... but even if I did call him out for being a prick at the right time I'm sure there would've been a way to turn it around. It doesn't matter much anymore because I don't hang out with people who put me down and I don't tolerate the shit that I once did. The point is, the worst things that are not listed that have occurred, that have been said to me or done to me always involved Gio. Once Gio was out of the picture, I can never think of anything that Tom was involved in doing negatively aside from the items in the short list above. 

&nbsp;

#**START HERE IF YOU WANT TO READ LESS AND GET TO THE POINT**
_______________________________________________________________________

&nbsp;

**TL;DR: Screw the backstory, this is the part that matters and where I seek guidance.**

Tom has a small family and doesn't live too far away. A few months ago I was biking to the store when we saw each other and I got off my bike to talk to him on foot. We got on to the topic of opiates because he knew a friend of mine that used opiates a lot for years. We discussed having both tried our fair share of Roxys 30s and the like. Tom pointed out that they seem to eliminate all pain and we agreed that it's understandable that anyone would easily get hooked. Over a couple of weeks alter this Tom contacted me to see if I could help him get any of those things we spoke about. Tom explained he was trying to avoid withdrawals from his recent DOC.

&nbsp;

As it would turn out, I couldn't help him at the the time but a few days later he notified me that he could get Perk ten's. He spotted me a small amount of them for a couple of days until pay day. Gave me the opportunity to buy a few form someone after pay day. They prevented me from going into withdrawal, an arguably light withdrawal with my tolerance at the time and slight buzz or energy boost. **How much of the Perks was Tom using?** Maybe 7 or 12 a day? His **ROA** was interesting to me. You can't or shouldn't snort perk 10's because the acetaminophen makes many people puke. Tom would basically **chew on them before swallowing** to get high. 

&nbsp;

**Exit strategy:**

As the weeks went on, sometimes he'd help me get something and other times I'd help him get something. The latter was not as often because he didn't do H. Tom only messed around with pharmaceutical opiates.  However, yesterday Tom was texting my friend Cliff a lot. Asking for just one or two bags of H. Now at his tolerance level, one or two bags of H will not get Tom very far. Not to mention up until yesterday it was my understanding that Tom was totally against doing Heroin. I hope hasn't tried shooting it yet but I can see it happening. At this point it seems that the best option is for me to push him towards getting subs by any means possible. 

&nbsp;

Tom has an addictive personality and I fear that if he goes on Subs he'll do more just so he could ""feel something."" Yes, he speaks of getting opiates in order to avoid getting sick but when he has any amount he chews through them rapidly. A few months back he'd only do them at night time. Now he still does the same thing which makes it hard for him not to sleep at work but I believe he's no longer at the point where he could avoid feeling sick without doing anything in the day time. My next step is to determine how Tom feels about subs. If he would honestly use them at recommended dose or if he'll go off the rails with that. 

&nbsp;

I want to see my friend Tom on subs before he's getting on IV Heroin. If he does end up IV'ing dope then I definitely want to help him get on Subs even if it's a less than desirable does. I'm not gonna make him do anything he doesn't want to do nor can I force him to but I'm starting feel a sense of urgency about his addiction and at least know he doesn't want to lose his family or contact with his kids. Maybe if he only snorts H it'll all be fine because he'll spend less. Then again, he'll probably do more because they cost less then his tolerance will go up thereby costing him more like before.

&nbsp;

I don't know if this post serves more to tell a story or gives information that might help people from here form advice for my friend and I.  **Please, if anybody can suggest ideas, options and and approaches based on what was written in the past five paragraphs, I'm all ears.**",1499557601.0

After this stuff is gone, that's it. Will NOT be getting anymore. No money to get anymore and I am ready to get clean or at least get on subs so I can get my life back. 

Question is this, I need to wait at least 18 hours from last dose before I can dose. Should I just finish it all off now and be done with it for good and be able to induce subs tomorrning. Or should I drag out the little  0.4 of bth I got left and probably won't be able to induce subs until tomorrow evening. Btw I am on pacific standard time. What do u guys think of the best solution? I'm personally tihnking it just smoke it all now and be down with it.....just concerned might not be able to sleep tonight, but I do have some benzos and seroquel if needed... 

What do you guys think? Finish it all off now and be done with it? Or space it out with tiny little doses throughout the day until it's done? 


EDIT:. Thanks for all the prompt advice! From your opinions and really thinking bout it, definitely going to smoke it all right now and just be done wit it.

It'd be good to talk to him sometimes and hear his laughter and it makes me mad that I lost him) so it was kinda strange that this woman said I looked like a Scott.

It took a minute to get acquainted with playing Spades again but me and my partner pwned the fuck out of our competition. 



Listening to people's situations and empathizing with them. they are happier to be here when they don't feel the need to isolate nor am I, although a couple times a day I need to go and bug out for a minute... because I just want out of here.  

Last, but most importantly, I look forward to hearing her voice every day and got to see pictures of her beautiful smile last night and it was so very very very bright and made me smile. I also really enjoyed reading her writing. Thank you, babe.

This person had a procedure performed and was prescribed just enough pain medication to get them through until their first follow-up appointment. They were prescribed 5/325 oxycodone/acetaminophen.  They take 1-2 of these every 4-5 hours as needed. They were required to travel for their job but this means they will need to reschedule their follow-up and the physician will not refill the prescription without an office visit. This person is not comfortable with trying to go find a different doctor or emergency care center, while out of town, to try and get another prescription in the interim. This person however, is able to get a couple of Suboxone. I understand that these are much stronger than Percocet. 

My question is whether or not it would make since to take maybe a quarter of Suboxone as needed until they can get to a proper follow-up appointment. I don't even know if Suboxone has the same sort of painkiller properties so I apologize about my lack of knowledge on the subject but appreciate any help. ",1499694115.0

Back to California. I'm stuck here in Jersey. I already miss him so damn much. I had really been enjoying spending this time with him, and while I knew this day was gonna come, I just wish I got a little more time. 

While I've always been a junky, I've always put caring for my son before I ever worried about getting high. Thankfully my mom has been helping a great deal with caring for him because she works from home. I have to work 40-50hrs a week so it's difficult being a single parent because who the hell else would care for the kid if I didn't have my mother? I'd basically be screwed. 

But living with my mother has been quite enabling for my habits because I've never had to take responsibility for using opiates and being an alcoholic because at the end of the day I could rely on her to make sure the kid is okay. I know I fucked up bad. 

So here's the plan: I NEED to get my shit together, but I don't know what to do about work. I need to stay here a few more months because this is my first job out of college so I want to have close to a year's experience under my belt before leaving. Not sure what I'd be able to do about my job because getting clean is going to incapacitate me with withdrawals for over a week. I feel like dealing with both opiate and alcohol withdrawal at the same time is going to be brutal. If I can make it a few more months I can leave my job, get clean, then move back out west with either my friends or my father and still get to be in my son's life, AND hopefully be clean for opiates. 

So now I'm doing what I do best. Just lined up four bags of #4 to be split up both my nostrils, then gonna go to town on a pint of jack, and if I'm still standing after that gonna smoke a few bowls of some Afghan kush, and maybe drink a Heineken or two. Hopefully I wake up tomorrow because I'm probably going to need to use a sick day after tonight. Quite frankly I don't give a fuck about it tonight. 

I sure hope everything works out in the end. Been struggling for Fucking years to stay off the H and oxy and even worse the booze. Can't seem to ever get any clean time and it's been about 9 years since I first became an addict.  I've been an addict through 35% of my entire life and 100% of my adult life, I don't even know what a normal life is.

Need to find some inner peace with myself and learn to live life sober. But for tonight I'm gonna find some inner peace the way I'm used to. Wish me luck.",1499662003.0

I knew I had to just get by until 9 a.m. or so but I wasn't handling the w/d good at all this time. I definitely prayed out loud a few times asking to just get me through this night among other things lol.

So about an hour ago I decided to jump in the shower for a little bit of relief and wash of that stank withdrawal sweat.  After hopping out I dried off and what not and I opened up the medicine cabinet to get toe nail clippers and when I reached in I bumped a band aid package and it fell out onto the counter of the sink. To my utter amazement, shock, and gratitude out comes a tight wrapped baggy with 4 bags if dope and 2 bags of coke in it!!! I thought I was hallucinating at first but pretty quickly I remembered that when I was blacked out on benzos a few weeks ago that I had lost this bag of goodies. My girl and friend both thought I was lying and had just done the shit when I was all fucked up.

I believed them too because I couldn't remember for the life of me where I put them and I searched everywhere I could think of. I have no idea what made me put them in that band aid box because I've never used it for anything like that before but I'm grateful that I did lol.

I had been at the final stop on my trip for over a week and everything had fallen through. I got jacked for $80 by some kid when I first got to town. I rolled up to the address, but he was being weird and wouldn't get in my car. ""Nah, it's hot out here"" implying that serving me through the car window is somehow less sketchy looking. He handed me the tied up corner of a grocery bag (which I've only ever seen people use for heroin). It smelled like tar as soon as he put it in my car. He asked for the money and I said ""let me check this out first"". As I opened the bag to find aspirin, he grabbed the cash out of my hand and booked it. I got out and chased him screaming ""you better hope you're faster than me motherfucker!"" until we hit the corner and he vanished somehow. I've only ever gotten burned one other time out of the hundreds of times I've purchased drugs, so I guess I'm still ahead in the long run, but my ego made me feel a bit foolish. I crept around for a while waiting for him to reappear and descend on his next victim, but no dice. Later, I would find out his real name and that he had burned several other people the same way. Eventually, he's going to find someone with nothing to lose, but I am not that person anymore and decide to chalk it up as a lesson learned. Still, a dangerous hustle to say the least, but I digress. I enjoy the festivities in town for the next week while still having zero luck finding what I'm looking for. In my random internet lurking, I hear about a place called ""Pill Hill"" which is supposedly the city's infamous open air drug market. I spent Saturday at a massive park party for the city's Pride festival with participation to the tune of 50,000 people. This park had its own open drug market right in front of dozens of cops for literally everything except what I wanted at the moment, sigh. Luckily, because of Pride, the public transit system was running all night, nonstop. At about 12:58am, I got ready for my journey into the night: boots tightened, necklace tucked, blade handy, valuables hidden, headphones off, etc. Finally, I put my long hair up to hide it with a beanie under a dark hoodie, pull the $30 I need out of my cash, and stash the rest on my body. I catch the train only to find out it stops running at 1am and have to get off after only one stop. I hoof it over to the nearest bus stop and, in the spirit of this sketchy mission, I hop on through the back door to save myself a few bucks that I will towards drugs instead. The bus drivers rarely seem to care this late. I love public transit for the people watching and this ride was everything I could have hoped for (except that it's usually even better if I'm high on something). As I look at the map on my phone, an older woman crushing aluminum cans with her bare feet barks in my direction ""get away from me!"". Now, I'm stranding about five seats from her and separated by a divider, but I didn't want any trouble, so I obliged ""me?? Uhh, okay"". A quiet, transsexual woman is playing some top 40 dance music from a portable speaker. Another more outgoing and heavy set transsexual woman is dancing so hard in her seat that it's rocking the entire bus. She's also very friendly, chatting up everyone around her. I can tell from experience that she is clearly rolling balls. For a moment, I am a bit jealous, but then I remember that I'm feeling a different vibe for this evening anyway. Still, I do appreciating seeing other people have a good time. Suddenly, older woman snaps at another younger dude, ""stop fuckin' staring at me motherfucker!"".
He replies, ""ain't nobody staring at you, I'm looking at my phone"".
""UH-HUH,  I don't play that 'looking at your phone' and staring at me shit"". They go back and forth a bit until he ends the discussion, ""look, I'm not staring at you, so get the fuck out of my face with that shit and stop talking to me"". The bus goes back to being quiet other than the usual rickety bus noises, the one woman warehouse rave happening next to me, and the sweet sounds of scrapping aluminum with your toes. You know, just normal bus shit. The chick that's rolling starts talking to the older woman with the persecution complex and asking her how she's doing. The older woman says something about ""these motherfuckers blah blah"" (""motherfuckers"" being the other dude and I). While still dancing she says, ""oh, that guy that was staring at you?"". In my head, I'm thinking ""oh, come on dude"" haha. I don't think she meant to get the older lady worked up again, but I could see that having another person confirm her paranoia was about to cause her to go back to yelling. However, just as we were pulling up to my stop, we couldn't pull in because another bus was still there. Our driver honked at it, which got our attention. Someone yelled out that a dude and a chick were fist fighting on the stopped bus, so everyone dropped what they were doing to rubberneck through the back window. They were trading blows, but it was over pretty fast, the chick got off the bus, and we pulled into our stop. As soon as my feet hit the pavement, the familiar stench of dried piss stung my nostrils. I looked around to see a lot of people huddled in front of closed businesses and a few passed out in the sidewalk; I could tell I was getting closer. I watched three cop cars drive in the direction I was walking, but I was too close to the prize to let it phase me. I double checked all my shit and walked the last half mile to the corner. I saw a bunch of people loitering outside a liquor store diagonal from me; it became apparent that this was the pot of poppy at the end of the junkie rainbow. Before I could even hit the second crosswalk to get there, a Hispanic dude in his 30s hollered at me quickly, ""chiva? Aye, you need any chiva?""
""Got any roxies?"", I replied.
""Nah, no roxies man""
His friend, an older black man with a deeply gravely and commanding voice said, ""yeah, I got some roxy 10s, how much you need?""
""30"", I replied.
""Well, I got three 10s, so that's the same as a 30.""
Said the voice that, in my imagination, sounded like DMX's father if he smoked a pack a day for 40 years. He motioned for me to follow him over maybe 15 feet from the corner, but still on the main road. We ducked into the archway entrance of what seemed like a seedy apartment building.
""Can I check 'em out first?""
""Yeah, here's one of them.""
Didn't look like any oxycodone I had ever seen. 
""Cool, I'm just gonna look it up real quick.""
""Sure man, they say M H10. I googled it this morning. They're roxy 10s.""
""It says they're hydroxyzine.""
Hydroxyzine is a prescription antihistamine. It might wash down nicely with some oxy, but it definitely wasn't worth any money.
""Oh, well I got an OP80. That's better than that shit anyway. Here check this one out"".
I hate the OPs even though I don't usually snort oxy when I do it, but at this point I was willing to take what I could get. It definitely looked like a real OP80.
""How much you want?""
""40 bucks for that one""
""I got 30""
""Can you at least make it $35?""
""I only have 30 right now, is that cool?""
""Yeah okay, just throw me something next time you see me on the block""
I hand him the $30 and go to pop the pill in front of him as recommended because I guess they sometimes work in crews to come jack you for the drugs so they can sell them again. Just as that little poop green jelly bean caressed my lips, it occured to me that I have virtually no tolerance anymore, so I bit it in half which pretty much confirmed that it was a legit OP80 because that shitty plastic was hard as fuck to crack.
""I have some acid, just not on me right now. I'm guessing you don't do that, but maybe you could sell it or something.""
""ACID?! Hell nah man, I don't fuck with acid. All I got is pills, dope, speed, and some Xanax.""
I always get a kick out of how most people that are into the hardest drugs look at me like I'm the devil when I offer them acid haha.  
""All right, well thank you man, have a good night.""
I kick rocks as quickly as I can without drawing attention. I turn the intersection three blocks down and I stop to pee on the corner. As I cross the street and head to a bus stop, another older dude with a cane whispers to me ""morphine 300mg.""
I slow my pace to think and do some druggie math in my head, but decide to keep walking.
""I got methadone too.""
The junkie in me stops, ""how much?""
""I got two 40mg pills, so 80mg.""
""How much you want?""
""Well, do you know how much they cost?""
""Yeah, how much do *you* want?""
He gave me a price that was way more than anyone else has ever had for those, ""nah, I'm cool. Thanks though man.""
The bus stop is out of service so I have to walk to the next one. I start feeling a little warmth on the walk. I end up getting lost for 15 minutes until I find the right stop. I start making small talk with all the people at the stop. I realize that I am high and sit down on the bus to begin writing this.
Fast forward, it's been two nights since the events above. I decided to stop by the same area at 5pm on a Monday. It's a different world during the day; the drug market is surprisingly much more active. I literally hadn't even gotten out of my car all the way when a guy walking by hollered ""roxies roxies roxies"" at me.
""Mind if I check one out?""
""For $25 you can check one out.""
""I mean can I look at it first and make sure it's legit?""
""I mean, these coming straight from the pharmacy man, but sure.""
He reluctantly put the tiny blue disk in my hand.
I scanned it thoroughly and it looked like a real M30 from my memory. The edges of the imprints looked a bit fuzzy, but that can happen and it was otherwise pretty on point. He even still had it in the correct pill bottle. I copped one for $25 which is the going rate around here (you can get them cheaper, but probably not cold copping). After we parted ways, I looked up the real and fake M30s and it looked real. I split it in half and railed 15mg. After a few minutes, I started feeling a buzz come on, so I decided to eat the other half. I got out of my car to fill up my water bottle and an elderly black man wheezed at me ""chiva, roxies!"". I said I was all good. On the way back to my car, a third middle aged man shouted ""OPs! OPs!"". I was feeling good, but not very high, so I decided to walk two blocks to get a donut because high fat snacks potentiate opioids by as much as 25-40% in some cases (according to the safety pamphlet that comes with 80mg oxy). On the short quest for my apple fritter fix, I lost count of how many people offered me every pill imaginable. At least 20 people said something. I had already taken the oxy and eaten half of the donut and I still wasn't quite where I wanted to be, but I only had $8 in my pocket. I only bring as much cash as I think I'll need because I don't want to get jacked or be tempted to blow all my money on drugs. I decided that if the right deal presented itself, I would go from there. One old lady sitting on her walker stopped me while I was walking by and said ""what you need?""
""Me?"" I played dumb because she gave off a weird vibe. 
""Yeah, what you need??"" she repeated in an even more demanding tone. 
""I don't know, Norco 10s?""
""Yeah, I got 'em for $5. How many?""
""Just one. Can I see it?""
""Not unless you give me the $5""
She didn't want to show me the Norcos first so I said ""I'm good then"" and she got mad and said ""fine, go see whoever you normally see then!"" Obviously, I don't have a person that I normally see, but it's good to know that you can develop a regular plug here if you want. A few steps later, the youngest dude I've seen out here asked me what I wanted. He was probably around my age (around 30, give or take a few years in either direction), dressed in all red from head to toe, and had almost a foot and 50 pounds on me (and I'm 6'2, 200 pounds). He looked pretty intimidating, but he actually ended up being the nicest street dealer so far. He asked me what I needed and I said ""Norco 10s"". He said he had 5s and he would give me two for $8. Even though another dude had offered me a 10mg for $7, I asked to check them out. He put them in my hand and they read ""M365"" as expected. While looking at them, someone said ""cops"". This is a good time to mention that out of the 10-15 people standing on that corner with me, all of them were hustling some kind of drugs. He got startled and said ""where the police at??""
I closed the pills in my hand and quickly nodded my head (rather than pointing) in the direction I had seen them a moment ago, ""I saw three of 'em standing up on that corner while I was walking over here"".
""Come on man, walk this way with me"".
We watch a cop car roll by slowly and then drive off.
""Okay, just $8 bruh""
I hand him the exact amount (because I'm cool like that; it's faster and more convenient for everyone), say thank you, and briskly split up. I ended up coming back again later that night and getting another 10mg hydrocodone.

I also saw a similar drug market in other parts of this city while attending park parties where people openly sold acid, mushrooms, molly, and other party drugs while cops lined the edges of the park. They only actually come into the park when someone gets stabbed, needs medical attention, etc. This place is pretty grimy, even in the nicer areas on some level. For example, they have signs everywhere that say don't call the cops if your car gets broken into and you can see broken glass all over the place. I even saw a group of people breaking into cars one night and while I was waiting at a taco truck, the same group walked by and grabbed the taco truck's tip jar. They didn't even run and the taco people didn't even call the cops either. I've lived in some pretty shitty neighborhoods in big cities both as a kid and in my adult years and I'm still amazed by this place. Did I mention that the drug bazaar is less than two blocks from a massive police station? I'm not saying it isn't sketchy because it definitely is. It's even sketchy for me and I'm a larger and fairly shady looking dude (even though I'm not shady at all). My experiences were pretty positive, but I still wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless they were fairly street smart, armed, and hyperaware of their surroundings.

My background - As of this weekend I did upwards of 90+mg oxy once or twice a day (good weekend). This is only important insofar as short term tolerance is concerned. Oxy has a short half life and tolerance changes, for me, within 3-4 days.

I didn't have enough cash or inclination to get more oxy today but did manage a 40mg opana ER (orange).

I searched reddit, bluelight, etc as I always do but there's just so much misinformation and speculation. When I get opana I usually err on the side of caution and end up snorting tiny amounts over a period of time and end up disappointed as fuck.

So instead, I went right to snorting and eighth of the pill which is 5mg (cut it in half, then in half again and then cut one of the quarters in half). 

Onset was *wicked fast*. I wasn't expecting that. I'm actually pretty fucked up now. Feels like 90+mg oxy easy.  *Way* more of a ""behind the eyes/nose"" sedation feeling which is nice. I usually have to wait 20 mins or more for that sensation after snorting oxy.

Because I'm a nervous nancy about unfamiliar drugs I'm a tad nervous because I am so high now but I think I'll be ok.

10 mins in and I had a bit of a panic attack. Started down the path of ""oh shit did I fuck up?!"" which made me freak a little but I went and smoked and relaxed and all is well.

I would say that if you have a reasonable oxy tolerance that 3-5mg might be a good place to start. My pulse is strong and steady now so by no means am I hammered but I'm definitely not taking any more for a while. I'm super hungry now tho so, yeah.
