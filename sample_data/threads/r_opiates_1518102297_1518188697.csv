Lovecraft.,"I first read this story at age 17, now I am almost 40... It has always remained in my mind as a story of drugs, depression, and death. It reminds me of my own journey with opiates and my self-destructive nature. I've used my nickname for a long time... I'm getting better, but I could have unlocked that door at any time....

It'll only take a moment...

Ex Oblivione by H.P. Lovecraft

When the last days were upon me, and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victim’s body, I loved the irradiate refuge of sleep. In my dreams I found a little of the beauty I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods.

Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the south calling, and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars.

Once when the gentle rain fell I glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world of purple twilight, iridescent arbours, and undying roses.

And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.

Many times I walked through that valley, and longer and longer would I pause in the spectral half-light where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely, and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk, sometimes disclosing the mould-stained stones of buried temples. And always the goal of my fancies was the mighty vine-grown wall with the little gate of bronze therein.

After a while, as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness, I would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves, and wonder how I might seize them for my eternal dwelling-place, so that I need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours. And as I looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall, I felt that beyond it lay a dream-country from which, once it was entered, there would be no return.

So each night in sleep I strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall, though it was exceedingly well hidden. And I would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely, but more lovely and radiant as well.

Then one night in the dream-city of Zakarion I found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of dream-sages who dwelt of old in that city, and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world. Therein were written many things concerning the world of dream, and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples, and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate. When I saw this lore, I knew that it touched on the scenes I had haunted, and I therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus.

Some of the dream-sages wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate, but others told of horror and disappointment. I knew not which to believe, yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures, and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace. So when I learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through, I resolved to take it when next I awaked.

Last night I swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves; and when I came this time to the antique wall, I saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar. From beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples, and I drifted on songfully, expectant of the glories of the land from whence I should never return.

But as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of drug and dream pushed me through, I knew that all sights and glories were at an end; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea, but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space. So, happier than I had ever dared hoped to be, I dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon Life had called me for one brief and desolate hour.",1518154917.0

That brings me to my question: What's everyone's experience with the name-brand strips vs. the generic pills? Is there anything I can do to ensure the absorption is as good with the pills besides not talking and making sure I don't have a ton of spit buildup in my mouth? I've heard of people bumping them but don't see how that absorption would work any better, since most of it would end up in your throat.

Anyway, heroin seems to be cheaper and better in general so I want to try it and see how it is. I just have a few questions first:

* What is nodding off like? When I do the DHC my eyes will close on their own and I will drift in and out of consciousness but at any time I can wake myself up and have enough energy to go out or the likes. Is it like this for heroin?

* How much should I take first time? I don't want to risk anything so how much would a completely opiate naive person take first time to snort/smoke

* what type should I get? I've heard theres different types, what type should I get for snorting/smoking.

* whats the difference between snorting and smoking?

He shut me down immediately and said they cannot even talk about it. I asked if he could just inform me about any contraindications and he said no. Even totally off the record? No. How about a hypothetical issue where some imagined patient wanted to make sure weed wont fuck with the seven different psych meds I (oops, imagined patient) is taking? I SAID NO!

The reason I bring this up is I am on a pain contract with the VA and am on moderate dose opiates (120 5mg percs a month, 4 per day). I have a long and detailed history of heroin addiction (caused by over prescription of opiates by the VA) and it has taken me a LONG time to earn the trust of my doctors and get put back on opiates.

I am terrified of popping hot for TCH and being totally fucked and in a world of hurt.

It is so frustrating that the Feds have cracked down so hard on federal level providers and they cannot even mention stuff like weed.

My abuse of oxycodone is a stress/anxiety relief function. And help with sleep. So will marijuana do the same for relaxing and sleep and pain relief

From before the fall, it is that holy feeling we all search for; the orgasm in slow motion, the sunrise that brings light to the dark places and sends the shadows into retreat. Reminiscent of that moment before dawn, when everything was new. It is fragrant with memories of that last picnic, when you, your mother, and your father were together as one for the last time, when you needn’t ask, nor be told, you simply knew; you were loved. It is the word that has a name but that for the life of you, you cannot remember. It takes you back to when you did, and you almost recall, but then you forget you ever cared. It is a pensive bliss, a forlorn glee. It is the tides’ gentle lapping at your toes, lazily kissing more and more of you until your every fiber is graced by its warmth and your entirety is submerged in a sea of sedation. It is a tranquilizing nostalgia, a paralyzing peace; a perfect calm and quiet rest, such that you dare not move, lest you disturb the stillness, the innocence. But you haven’t any cause to move, for everything is as it should be; as though the caretaker of your heart has flipped the breaker to every frayed and sparking nerve keeping you awake to the pain of this world, closed the blinds, and turned out the lights that you may sleep now for the first time in years. It is as though a divine hand has clasped hold of the soul you let slip from your grasp so it may be spared the harshness below. You may rest without worry, for you have no need of love. Neither to or to be. Without risk there is no reward and you will take the participation ribbon for no reward is worth the risk. The tin man was a fool. Isolated and immune, you are Only; this flower coated armor your best and only friend. Empty; you will outgrow it. What then? In the interim, sleep long and breath easy; you are loved, though you do not care to know it.

Personally I think Opiates are more euphoric. They have a smoother euphoria, opiates make me feel good about doing nothing, stimulants make me feel good about doing things. To me, Meth doesn't feel euphoric on its own, it only makes doing things much more fun. It increases the reward of things like playing video games or cleaning the house. Heroin you can just sit there in a chair and feel good but doing things also feels good. Heroin you can relax or do things. Meth will make you do something. Same with Dextroamphetamine.

Hi all, had a few questions to anyone who has BOC online. Basically, just set up a checkings today with BOC and just set up an online account too. I know with Chase bank, there is a lot of fraud prevention steps to logging on online. For example, a new computer needs verification by email or text. Also, for example if I use my debit card to make a purchase over $XXX Amount, it will send an email over, etc, stuff like that.

The lady today helping me set up the account told me I need a smart phone to use BOC online but can use it at the computer so I was wondering how similar it was to Chase online banking. Is BOC linked to the email address like if its my first time logging on at a location, will I need to verify with code? Can I set up text alerts without a smart phone? (Like placing a number on the account for protection, like BOC will send a text with a code to me if any log in problems), or anything like that? Or is it simply, use your email and password at any desktop/location and you can log in to view your banking information? 


Thank you anyone who took their time to read and/or respond. Have a good day!!!

=================== Random Opiate story that was promised.======================

===================================================

(First time buying crap Heroin when studying abroad)


I use to study abroad in China (Guangdong Province) a few years back. I was sent there originally to teach English but the program I signed up for didn't provide me with the ESL classes/certificates when I got there so didn't end up teaching. I had an addiction (heroin, but loved blues and opanas) problem back in the US, and Overdosed twice in the 2 months prior to going so my parents/aunt put money together and signed me up for a semester to learn Chinese to give myself time to get back to normal. They thought the strict laws there would deter people from selling and especially me from using. But during the first semester, I somehow managed to get myself into a bunch of shit and addicted to H again. What fucking shit.

About a month into the semester, I was with my friend Tack who was a skinny Indonesian kid with a bunch of tattoos and a funny looking face, he told me he met some new friends who were going to the club and asked me to go. A club was popular place to go among the foreigners. It was around 7pm and we went first to meet up with his new friends he met. So we got to their apartment, and what do you know, 2 Frenchman. They were 2 brothers, Tom and Arthur. Their apartment was very very nice and expensive, even for regular foreigners it was pricey. I say this because 1 USD = 6.1 RMB the time I was there and the USD just went farther making it seem like you are richer, but this apartment was nice is all I am saying. Anyways, both of them spoke English well, and Tom actually went to Cambridge University in England. Tom was also studying at the same school me and Indo Tack studied at but he was also there working in Finance in one of the big companies there (hence the expensive aprtment). His brother Arthur was in town visiting because it was his birthday. 

So we are pregaming at their place since they bought some Chinese beer (Tsingtao) and had a bottle of some liquor i never seen before. I'm not a drinker so i got buzzed pretty quickly. I pulled Tom aside and asked him how long he was there for and if he liked to party a lot. He told me he'll smoke weed every once in a while and even found people with weed in China. I was trying to slowly push his buttons to see if he fucked with opiates, but he told me back in England he did Coke a lot. Anyways, I was thinking to myself I would be fine with Coke. I've only done it a handful of times but I wanted to feel good that night and weed doesn't do it for me. So I asked him straight up if he had any contacts that could hook me up with something.


So he said yeah he has a connect there and gave me his guys number and told me to call him. I called him up and the guy has an accent made it more difficult to understand, I don't want to steriolize  but it was an African dude. It took a few tries but i asked him if he had Heroin after trying to beat around the bush, and he said yea he does and its $600RMB for a bag. I asked him if that was a gram or what? But he didn't understand me and I still to this day don't know how they measured out the bags. The 600 came out to around $95 or round up to $100 USD so I was expecting something good. He told me he'd be over there in 20-30 minutes. 


So i didn't exactly tell Tom what I was buying, I think he thought it was weed, and for sure, Tom's brother and my friend Indo Tack had no clue and they were waiting to leave to go to the club but I was waiting on the dealer so i kept saying just wait a little longer wait a little longer. I'm not sure how long it took but he finally came thru and by this time it was maybe 8 or 9pm and was pitch black outside. We just met on the street because there was no where private we could go, and i asked him let me see it first and he said okay. I pull out the bag and opened it up and dipped my finger in for a taste, and although it was dark out, he's like man becareful here. And to this day I have no clue what I got, I don't know if it was heroin or what. I didn't know about Reddit then or thought I would be buying more, so I never thought to take a picture and save for later. But the supposely heroin was kind of small chunks of soft clay like texture kind of in the letter C. It wasn't powder by any means, but it had that vinegarish smell and in a way tasted a little bit like H or what i can remember it tasted when I was back in the US. I asked him 3 times, what is this shit, and he kept saying yes man it's heroin, it's heroin. Because of the taste and just wanting to feel something, i bought it anyways. 


By now, Indo Tack, Tom and Arthur are outside and say cmon let's go to the club. So while we wait for a taxi, i tell them hold on and run to a public bathroom toilet quick to try and snort some of what i thought was heroin. Of course, there were no American style toilets in the bathroom, you have to squat to shit, So i had nothing to place my Dope on where i can crush it up and make lines etc. so i close the whole door on the bathroom and just use the sink and hope no one comes in. Anyways, so like i said before, the dope wasn't powder, it was this strange substance, I still don't know how to describe. Only if I saw it again I would be able to know. But I dump out a little bit and use my card to try and crush it up and cut out a line. The dope didn't really crush, like it was clay like and just got smooshed when i tried pushing it down. But the taste and the smell was just too similar to what I remember of H, so i kept trying at it. Eventually, shit breaks alittle bit but not into fine powder. It's kind of like bigger chunks but it's the best i could do with the time so I snorted it and went back out to catch the taxi with my friends. 

5 or 10 minutes pass and there was definitely something in that shit i bought. The feeling came on strong, a little euphoric, but not that much, but I was feeling something. I don't know if it was a placebo effect, but I swore I felt a small head rush like when you do a line, and then in a good mood after that. Since it did the job, i never questioned it and did hit up the dude a few times after that. (He came with powder after that which more resembled H then that first time shit). So we went to the club and got mad drunk and i told Tom and Arthur what i got and they asked for a line lol. I told them exactly what i told you guys, it wasn't like normal dope and it has a strange texture and they didn't care. They snorted some and said they felt good too and we hopped clubs a few times and ended up going back at 7am. 


Anyways, sorry for the long rant, this was just the first time i picked up in a foreign county. Later on, i met a different dealer with 100 times better shit like AMAZING shit, and other things that happened to me, spent 2 weeks at a detox hospital (I was only foreigner in there), and it was mad strange there!, also saw a regular doctor who prescribed medicine for withdrawals, getting hooked onto sleeping medicine and not remembering a lot of stuff (Zopiclone/Ambien drugs), got into a street fight while waiting for my dealer, and had to do some grimy shit to get some money there, which i can tell these stories/or answer questions if anyone is interested.. only because this was mad long and kind of shitpost/rant, so i don't know if anyone actually read this. If you did, thank you!


Thank you for reading if you got through all of it.

He has never been to any drugs before besides marijuana and never taken opiates. He has definitely battled bad depression and also alcoholism (he was prob a “functioning” alcoholic) this year. 

According to him he has only been on fentanyl for 3 months and was only shooting up at work (he works 3 days a week) and the most he did was 500 micrograms in one shift. I did catch him with a fentanyl in his pocket about a month ago which he said he returned to hospital (he now admits he actually used it) and also he admitted to injecting over Xmas when he was off work (so these kinda go against him saying he only used at work). Also besides fentanyl he said he just took 1 morphine XR one time and no pills besides that.  Like i said some of this doesn’t add up but he really has no reason to lie about it now. 

My question is do you think it is possible for this one 30 day stay in rehab to be enough to help him get sober? I have heard so many horror stories about multiple stays At rehabs not working. However, 3 months doesn’t seem that long, will that help? He definitely wants to get sober. ",1518084264.0

is there any hope that i can stop here, and prevent withdraws from starting over? i used such a minuscule amount of dope compared to my regular dose, that im hoping i continue foward without having lost all my progress. 

i cant remember the last time i felt this devastated in my life. i carved out a rare window of time from my job/ other obligations to get this behind me and i still manged to fuck it up. 

and an honest word of warning: as helpful as benzos can be, i can assure you that my resolve in the withdrawal process was as strong as its ever been, but it call came crumbling down after one two many xanax. 

anyways, sorry to ramble. is there any chance that my withdrawal will not start from the beginning? any response will be greatly appreciated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ",1518084219.0

Why Legalization of all Narcotics Benefits Everyone!,"I was inspired to write this essay upon a realization I received after reading this reply:

""..i wish dope was legal and fent wasn't an issue. In fact all drugs i wish were legalized and the money go to schools, rehabs, and anything else that can benefit society. Imagine if we took the taxes of drugs plus all the money spent to police them and spent it on making society a better place for all.""
~Ddddooope 
 
When Dddddooope made the connection between fentyal contamination as a product of criminalization, this realization dawned on me: 

All negative aspects (beyond the control of the user) is a result of The Criminalization of Narcotics period 


I believe future generations will reflect on the results of the prohibition of narcotics as a Holocaust. Not only as a transgression against the user & the addict, & their families but for everyone. 

The good news is we are on the tail end of prohibition. I believe in our lifetime drugs will be at least decriminalized (hopefully legalized).

People forget that The prohibition of alcohol required a constitutional amendment. Therefore the US Harrison Narcotics Act 1919 is 100% unconstitutional & total bullshit. 

If anything was learned from Alcohol prohibition, it was that prohibition doesn't work. Morality and Human Behavior cannot be legislatively fixed, and that when you prohibit something in strong demand it has the effect of concentrating power & money in the most ruthless suppliers. Which is the real reason behind drug prohibition. This created access to an unregulated source of bottomless fundraising for criminal elements of the power structure (e.g. CIA Iran contra etc.).

It's estimated that Heroin is a 2 to 4 trillion dollar a year market (tax free &w/out regulations) that's a lot of zeros:

$2,000,000,000,000 

Over 95% of world opium is produced in Afghanistan (post US invasion of course!) and 75% of that Afghan opium is converted into heroin in Pakistani labs. 

Please Don't get it twisted these Afghan Farmers are still poor AF and basically paid nothing. 

The real money is made somewhere downstream from the manufacturers and they have probably been cashing in for centuries (e.g. Skull&Bones Fraternity at Yale was created with Opium Money) 

On the Bright-side some European countries like Portugal have Decriminalized narcotic possession. Instead of arrest for those who are found in possession of illicit drugs, they are sent to a panel of health professionals that offer education and rehabilitation. 

The results of Portugals decriminalization proved unequivocally that drug decriminalization is beneficial to individual user &  the public health of Portugal. HIV/AIDS/Hep C across the board showed double digit % decreases. Although recreational drug use increased by 2-5% the overall rate of addiction dramatically decreased. Naturally Several other countries have followed Portugal example and universally showed positive results on both individually and societally.

Even some in the US have seen the light like Maryland in 2016 introduced a drug decriminalization bill(decriminalizing small,personal amounts), but it was voted down in the state house and not enacted into law but progress is progress

The legalization of recreational use of Marijuana has inspired hope in junkies like me that legalization of all recreational drugs is a possibility 

Full Legalization of Drugs should not seem radical, considering for millennia before 1919 essentially all drugs were legal and Human civilization progressed just fine(thrived even) with drugs legal. In fact in Ancient Rome it was considered a spiritual and narcotic use was encouraged during the end of year festival Saturnalia (the origin of a lot of Christmas traditions)

Truthfully it is an extremely  draconian to criminalize drug use. Attempting to legislate human morality or free will has be proven impossible every time it has been attempted.  

Furthermore the US Drug War has historically been more expensive then all other US Wars COMBINED! The ""War on Drugs"" Racks up federally $15 billion/year ($500 a second) since the Nixon Administration in the 1970s plus another $25 billion/yr from State and local governments. 

48 years x [($15b+25b)] = 
$1,927,000,000,000 

How many people could be sent to life saving rehabilitation with that money? How many people could that feed? How much Dope would that buy? 

 The result of trillions of tax pay dollars thrown at the drug war, and the people who are on the drugs have been ""winning"" because illegal drugs have never been more accessible than they are now. 

The demand for drugs will never, ever, ever(X infinity) go away regardless of legality, health risk, or price etc. therefore suppliers will always be willing to supply Drugs regardless of risk, legality, logistical difficulties, low logistical productivity etc.(to infinity). We know this to be true because of the continuous ingenuity of drug traffickers e.g. Narco Submarines, Narco Tunnels, etc. 

lt is important to note the negative ripple effect Drug Criminalization has on a macro & micro level, individual level & family and a governmental/societal/political level. 

The extent of the negative impact cannot be understated. 


 Drug Criminalization has had a disastrous effect on Narco Producing Countries in Central and South American: 
A historical example in Escobar's Columbia out of control hit men gunning down people in the streets, political bombings, lead to Chaos that spilled over into as automatic gunfire in Miami Malls. This continues today in Mexico  which has had Vietnam War level causalities/deaths because of out of control Narco Cartels who supply an out of control US demand for illegal drugs. 

When the Taliban Took power in Afghanistan after the 1980s USSR occupation. Opium production was nearly eliminated, but post US invasion opium production (protected and encouraged by the US Military & government) increased astronomically The result of this is a world-wide opiate pandemic. 
Historically invasion and control of Afghan Opium production seems to be a reoccurring ""Hail Mary"" pass for failing empires e.g. USSR 1980s British circa 1900. 

War and control of Narco Supply fit like hand and glove:

The British fought more than one hundred year long Opium Wars with China. Golden Triangle Heroin production during the Vietnam War. That became ""blue magic"" heroin in NYC. Amphetamine production by North Koreans and terrorist organizations like ISIS helps fund the most radical regimes. 

Again The negative impacts manifest everywhere on all levels of society. nowhere is unaffected from the negative impact of drug criminalization. 

As a global family we can not prevent addiction or outlaw it away. What we can do is control the way we as a society REACT  to the inevitability of addiction. 

It is a common misperception to place sole blame of these horrors on addiction itself; when it's our lazy and ignorant  ""throw them in jail"" mindset while trillions are made by ruthless suppliers and trillions spent on arresting low level users and sellers Is the cause of all these negatives . 

All of these negativities can be prevented by recognizing the problem, and taking action towards a solution.

The head of the hydra is our lack of oversight and regulation of the Narco Trade. 

It is harder for a teen to get Alcohol and Cigarettes than illegal drugs. 

This is because Alcohol /Tobacco:
#1.use is recognized as an inevitability and by nature ""unprohibitable"" (prohibition lesson learned)

#2 strict oversight/heavily regulated on all levels (its use,distribution, production , marketing, purity, qualities etc) 

#3 the public is educated about the risks (everyone knows cigs cause cancer & suppliers are required to disclose these risk clearly)

#4strict boundaries define extent of use,consumption, and interactions with society while under influence of effects. (Everyone knows not to drink and drive and everyone knows the consequences of crossing these boundaries, Also suppliers of Alcohol and Tobacco know the age requirements and the consequence of selling to under age) 

Additionally Alcohol and Tobacco generates tax revenue on a local, state, and federal level. 


Narcotics supply, consumption, production, and sale could be successfully regulated, oversaw, with clear set boundaries.

Quality and Purity would increase while price decreased. The BS of a sellers market would go away and accountability would reign! 

Almost overnight the negative ripple effects discussed above would decrease dramatically while public health would increase. 

I am sure there are a lot smarter people than me out there who don't spend most of there time fantasizing about opiates like I do 

I challenge anyone to refute this logic. I don't understand why we let this happen. I know there is a group of over 100k law enforcement officials who are for the legalization they have a group somewhere.

What was your first opiate? And if your opiate of choice is H, what made you switch over?

I guess I will go first...

I started off in my senior year of high school, got my wisdom teeth out and they prescribed me some hydros. Well I didn't even take them till a couple weeks later, took two before school and I was amazed on how amazing I felt, I was so talkative and I was actually paying attention for once. Well that fun only lasted a couple days. Then a month or so goes by and I went to snag one of my dads cigarettes and I noticed a couple pill bottles... so of course I check it out... little did I know my dad who I am really close with was getting loads of hydros and OxyContins (before the tamper seal). So I snagged some every so often when I knew he had extra from previous months.

 At some point he noticed but my dad didn't care and started giving me some. Then his medical condition was getting worse so he would spend time in rehab (physical rehab not drug rehab). Well he would do rehab for a couple weeks at the most and when he was released they would give him all the left over medications to take home! Meanwhile he was still getting his monthly supply from his doctor. So we had plenty of pills. Sadly my dad is now full time at a nursing home, but I love my dad and visit him everyday. Plus I have met some really good connects at the nursing home!

I was like ""uhhh, good until I got a call to come here"". 

So Pavel explains the situation to me. Since Oleg can't pay, and they can't find him, Taras and his ""people"" are going to take the family house instead. The guy in the suit was some bank or city official who the mafia had paid off to help them do these types of things. The house isn't great but I think it's gotta be worth more than $10,000. I tell Taras, ""There has to be something we can do? you can't take their house because of something Oleg did. His family has nothing to do with it"" So Taras takes me aside and starts asking me questions about my time as a soldier. He tells me that ""the men in Kyiv"" are supplying the volunteer battalions with men and equipment. If I agree to spend a year over in Eastern Ukraine, helping to train the guys and show them how to use the equipment, they'll leave my family alone, make me a ""Captain"" and I'll also be paid for my time. Well if you know anything about the war over there, that's a big ol' ""fuck that"" from me. I did my time and barely made it out. No fucking way. So Taras says fine we take the house and your family can sleep in the street. 

At the end of the day, I agreed to pay off Oleg's debt (I have quite a bit of money saved up) and in return, Iveta signed the house over to me. Literally the day after that all happens, Oleg gets home from wherever the fuck he was and acts like everything is great. This was about 3 years ago, and I have since been paid back as well. But not by Iveta, but by Ivetas sister. Why her sister you ask? Well, dumb fuck Oleg borrowed more money and got in with the wrong people, AGAIN. But thats a story for another time. 

I'll try to answer any comments or questions you have in the comments and thanks for reading/being positive about it even though I'm a shitty writer. Also, this really has nothing to do with me or anyone being a junkie, I guess I just happen to be a junkie while all this is happening lol. Happy nods or sober days....whichever you happen to be doing. ",1518077381.0
7w3cgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7w3cgh/afterglow/,0,https://redd.it/7w3cgh,NJcTrapital,Afterglow,"Sup everyone, i have my same old work day ahead of me tomorrow and had a plain old workday today. I've gotten my use and kept it at ~2x a week, still sniffin bags (#4ECP) all is well.

Lately I have noticed significant afterglow and often significant times after my last dose. Today I dosed im the morning, I don't exactly feel high or euphoric but im awake and content. What Zvlyn
mean is normally I start to get sleepy by 8pm. Its past 2 and I could stay up for many more hours, feeling pretty damn good.

Whats the pharmacology behind me feeling so good so long after? It's as if when I dose I flip a switch, even after the high fades the switch is flipped the rest of the day. Like I'm wired but not wire-y with energy like stims, certainly not euphoric as the first 30-90 mins after dosing dope. 

100% not complaining! 

TL:DR can a drug nerd/professional opiate warrior please explain the pharmacology behind heroin afterglows plz?",1518077255.0

I just really want to get high, I just miss that easy euphoria and everything.

I just want to know what's the best way to deal with this. I've been using kratom pretty frequently but I feel like that doesn't really help for more than an hour or two. Any help is appreciated, thanks.",1518073872.0
