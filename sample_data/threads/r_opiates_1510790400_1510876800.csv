I was like 14?

Anyway, the doctor felt real bad about that so he prescribed me a BUNCH of percocet i‚Äôm honestly surprised the pharmacy let the order go through. (Then again, this was 9 years ago) 

I remember coming home and my jaw hurt so bad, the doctor said i could take 2 at a time. The strongest thing i had ever fucked with was extra strength Excedrin so this really was a shock. 

After they hit me, i remember thinking ‚Äúwow, so **this** is drugs? Cool, i want to be doing that *always*.‚Äù That was the greatest 2 weeks of my life, then they all ran out üòî. I only got to do them once or twice a year when i, or a family member got hurt, or a friend would spot me.

Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I'm a finance major in one of the top 10 undergraduate business programs in the country (not trying to brag, just trying to set the stage for how out-of-place this was) and I had an absolutely BRILLIANT idea today.  Since I had an exam, I decided that I would mix the last of my dope into a large shot and bring it with me to the business school building where my class was, and boot up in the bathroom beforehand.  I've never shot up in a school building (and never will again) and I had just finished lifting, so I was wearing a pair of old sweatpants.  I walk into the building, and about halfway to my class I put my hand in my pocket and realize the rig I loaded is not there.  I check the other pocket in bewilderment, but it's not there either, and I'm SURE I put it in my pocket.

I presently break out in a cold sweat as I feel a small hole in the pocket of my pants, and realize that somewhere on the 5 minute walk from the parking garage, past the campus police station, and into the business school, I have shedded a syringe loaded with what is unmistakably heroin.  Of course I turn around and begin to retrace my steps.

At this point, I feel it is necessary to point out that the building which houses our business school is one of the newest buildings on our campus, and is basically where my school pours most of its money.  To set the scene, we're talking marble floors in a huge atrium with a giant statue of one of the famous politicians who attended the school standing in the middle.  In short, this is not the type of place where you find drug paraphernalia.  Yet as I'm retracing my steps, I spot the orange cap to my loaded syringe sitting just inside the doors of the main entrance to the building.  I'm immediately struck by extremely conflicting emotions: on the one hand I am happy/relieved to have found it so fast, and I know it must have only been sitting there for a minute or so.  On the other hand, I realize that if I can see this loaded syringe sitting DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE of this nice marble floor from 50 feet away, just about anyone else can too.

It is here I know that Junkie Jesus was looking out for me, because despite this rig falling somewhere it could not possibly have been more visible, which also happens to be the area of the business school which sees the most foot traffic, not a single soul walked through those doors between the time when I dropped it and when I saw it.  I mean, it could not have been any more obvious.  There is a desk where a receptionist sits just inside the doors to direct visitors and help people, and had she been sitting at her desk, this rig would have been in the middle of her field of vision.  But mercifully, nobody saw it.

As I walked over towards it, I actually debated (for all of 3 seconds) whether I needed to just leave it, because I was worried someone HAD seen it, and was simply waiting to see who would come back to pick it up.  But then I realized 1. This is the last of my dope and I am not leaving this super-dank shot sitting on the floor, and 2. There will be a fucking shitstorm if someone comes and finds this thing sitting there.  Thinking fast, I went and picked it up, and then went outside, reached into my bag, and threw out a used rig I had in my backpack as discretely as possible, so that if someone actually was looking, I would look like someone who found a loaded syringe on the ground and decided to do the good thing and throw it out.

From there, i quickly went into the bathroom, did my shot (was slightly ruined by the fear the cops were going to swoop in at any moment), and then threw out every stitch of paraphernalia I had with me or on me.  I am never bringing anything with me on campus again.

Job is going terrific. 3 places want me to work for them right now because of what I can do. My arm is infected right now from being in the ocean w a cut and I guess I got some bacteria in it, so I took the day off work. I got SO MUCH accomplished. I was just writing in my diary how good everything is going and how good it feels to get so much accomplished in one day. So many little errands that I‚Äôve been meaning to take care of. Back when I was junkin‚Äô, even if I made a fucking phone call that I had been meaning to make, I felt accomplished. Was thinking to myself how nice tomorrow will be now that I got all of this shit done and I can just chill all day and watch movies and whatever. 

So job going good. No drugs for 6 months (yay). Getting stuff done in life. Been working out like a motherfucker and feel fit as fuck. Looking really good. My best friend today also just asked me to be his best man at his wedding, something I never thought anyone would want me to do...

Also- been banging this HOT AS FUCKING FUCK girl lately... I showed one of my buddies a pic of her and he didn‚Äôt even believe I could get a girl like that. He thought I was lying. Kinda felt good man. Anyway, girl wanted me to get an std check. Now, I honestly don‚Äôt have that much sex with different people and I was just checked (clean) last year, so STD check wasn‚Äôt super high on my priorities... I‚Äôm not showing any symptoms or anything. The girl just wanted us both to get checked so we could bang without condoms. So, getting checked was not even on my fucking radar until she brought it up the other day...I was just gonna do it more as a courtesy to her than anything else. 

So I‚Äôm out doing my errands. Finish the last thing I wanted to do that day. It‚Äôs late in the afternoon and I happen to be like directly across the parking lot from the clinic and I think ‚Äúfuck it, one last thing for today then I‚Äôm going home‚Äù.  

I walk in. It‚Äôs a free clinic. I just checked the boxes of the shit I wanted to get checked for and waited a couple minutes until they called me back. Pissed if a cup. Pricked my finger for blood. As we were waiting for the ‚Äúinstant‚Äù blood test thing to show a result I did more paperwork. As we were doing paperwork I saw the nurse guy glance at one of the strips that had blood on it and I noticed his demeanor change a little bit. He was kind of stern when I first walked in. Very terse and short. I was probably his last person for the day as it was almost 5 and he probably just wanted to get the fuck out of there. After he glanced at the strip his voice softened. His eyes became kinder. He said nothing and continued with questioning for his paper work. I dismissed it as me being paranoid. In a couple seconds he was gonna tell me that I was all good and send me on my way....

After the paperwork was done he looked at me and said ‚Äúok...let‚Äôs talk about your results‚Äù

Me ‚Äú...k‚Äù

Him ‚Äúso this strip is for HIV....you are negative‚Äù

Me ‚Äúpraise Jesus‚Äù

Him ‚Äúthis other test is for hep C....‚Äù

Me ‚Äú....‚Äù

Him ‚Äúi have some news for you...you are positive for hep C‚Äù

I was waiting for him to smile and tell me he was fucking with me and that I‚Äôm good and free to go. He didn‚Äôt. 

Fuck. 

God fucking damnit. Are you fucking kidding me?

He says there‚Äôs a 20% chance it was a false positive and they would have to draw actual blood instead of doing finger prick to know for sure but since my veins are totally fucked they were unable to do it. I‚Äôm gonna have to pound water and go for a run then go in tomorrow to have blood drawn to know for sure. 

You guys are the first to know. I haven‚Äôt even told my mom yet. I‚Äôm extremely upset about all of this.

So there I was, fantasizing about how great it‚Äôs gonna feel to get ALL my errands done and actually be able to chill on my days off instead of running around doing shit... and now I gotta go give them blood and probably get treated for hep fucking C. Not to mention break the news to this girl. 

I just can‚Äôt believe it. I mean, I even went and got a fucking flu shot today just because that‚Äôs the type of shit normal adults do! I mean, FUCK!

Fuck me, fam. 

Ain‚Äôt that some shit? 

As always, thanks for reading. 

Also- let this be a fucking lesson for everyone out there. Even after you get clean as fuck and you have your life back together... the life still has a way of catching up to you. One way or another, the piper gets paid. ",1510805375.0

I'm worried about pain management mainly because of my age, height, and weight so they wouldn't give me any or even close to my script. I also went to the ER a month before and they even gave me a script for 12 10 MG Oxycodone ( which again they never give pain pills but still was understanding of my situation ). I thought my tolerance would go down but because of the Kratom, one or two did nothing for my pain. I could take 3-4 10 MG Oxycodone and it would manage to bring my pain down to where I can function a bit normally. I honestly don't know what to do, I still live with my grandparents and they want me to get another job but it's too hard so I'm unsure on if going to Pain Management will even be beneficial. Not to mention, because I smoke weed, they would probably turn me down because I live in Georgia and weed is illegal here unless you have a medicinal marijuana card but even if you do have it, you can only carry CBD oil with 5% THC. Does anyone have any suggestions or can anyone tell me how a first appointment with PM will go? Worrying about all of this especially when I'm only 22 is just too stressful and I honestly wish I could just have my disease cured and never go to a doctor again. Sorry for the rambling, but anyways thanks for any help!

Tl;dr I'm short, young, weigh little, and I have transverse myelitis also my tolerance and pain is very high (can take 30-40 mg oxys) is going to PM worth it? If not what can I do?",1510802760.0

EDIT- Its funny because of a few things I mentioned all of a sudden people think im rolling in thousands of dollars of cash so let me clarify, firstly I went to a saudi arabian rehab center thats literally a fucking ""jail rehab"" if you can call it that and stayed there for 30 days. Yes I live in a house with maids but please please please dont assume I have thousands in CASH in my wallet, I had to sell my phone to get money to buy dope. Maybe I did not explain it well enough my situation at home is so unbelievably strict, extremely controlling that it feels like my self freedom is taken away, im literally in jail at home, FYI i am not allowed to close the bathroom door. I cant make a step or move if my mom is not home without calling my mom and letting her know, all phone records are looked at, all money is accounted for.. think about collecting money here and there over a months time to go buy? forget about it because EVERY SINGLE DROP OF CASH is accounted for. and ya those two maids alot of you keep mentioning are basically my moms general and lieutenant they watch my every move, not even a fart is made without my moms knowledge. I honestly dont understand the hate I have received just because my mom has two house maids, just like you I slept in the back of a shitty car. This lifestyle at home has drained me, and has made me nothing but a soulless human being. I came here looking for help because I have no one to talk to and everything is bottled up but it seems some people have envied me instead.

EDIT2- I did not steal or sell anything of my moms",1510801049.0

But then I always stop myself. Because I remember what it was like to listen to that kind of bullshit.

More specifically, I remember how I felt when I was still using, and would stumble upon some insufferable blow-hard touting his new sober life, urging me into the light with his own personal brand of aggressive positivity. Somewhere up there, I‚Äôd imagine, high upon his towering soapbox, there were an abundance of good intentions. And I guess to be drunk on sobriety is better than the alternative. But, personally, I‚Äôll pass on that lecture. Good for you, high-five, two thumbs up.

Fuck, man. I knew my life was shit. I knew there was a better way to do it. You didn‚Äôt exactly need to be an enlightened yogi to tell me that.

Regardless, whether I was reluctantly squatted in a metal chair at a 12-step meeting or browsing r/opiates (or, god forbid‚Ä¶ r/opiatesrecovery) this kind of method in egging people toward recovery did not sit right with me, and still to this day, does not. 

So, rather than go from the familiar bad life / good life dichotomy I‚Äôd rather attack this a different way, and merely bring to light a certain concept I learned through my struggles. One that I would never have had the luck of learning without suffering through my addiction to opiates. And my hope is that it can help someone regardless of whether they are trying to quit or not.

Long before my addiction, and even before I had even used any drugs at all, I was a sophomore in high school sitting in spanish class. I was lucky enough to have one of the coolest teachers around, Mr. Durazo. From students to staff, everybody loved Mr. D. 

He had a very sly talent of bestowing some solid life advice on his students. And in retrospect, his main goal may not have been to teach us Spanish but to prepare us for real life. Anyway, one day the topic of drugs came up in class. There was a recent weed bust at the school, and a several kids got expelled. It was such a hot topic at the time that no teachers were even attempting to graze the subject with a 10 ft. pole. But not Mr. D, he took it head on and had an encouraged open discussion about it. 

Sooner or later the topic delved into harder drugs, and before long, heroin came up. I am going to paraphrase here because it was a long time ago, but he said something to the extent of: 

‚ÄúYes, of course, there‚Äôs all the standard reasons to not use a drug like heroin, like overdose, needles, health reasons, etc. But, in addition to all of that, I‚Äôd imagine it would also leave somewhat of a... ‚Äòlonging,‚Äô if you will. Like a hole that could never be filled again. That is to say, I‚Äôd be worried that the experience would be so good and so pleasurable that no other future life experience could even compare. Just think about it! It‚Äôs not like your brain would just forget how heroin felt! Every single fun, happy, or pleasurable experience thereafter might only be judged in comparison to that one amazing time I did heroin, and thereby making that experience relatively less enjoyable.‚Äù

Pretty god damn insightful for a person who has presumably never used heroin before.

At the time, I remember not thinking too much into it. I had hardly started getting into pot at that point in my life so my opinions about drugs weren‚Äôt a priority. I don‚Äôt know why it even stuck with me after all these years. So, I didn‚Äôt really give it much thought, but I understood what he meant.

Basically, this kind of suff:

‚ÄúWow, that sex was great‚Ä¶ well...I mean, it wasn‚Äôt like heroin great, but it was still good.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat an amazing hike that was, look at the view! What an experience! Ya, not a heroin experience, but still great!‚Äù

‚ÄúThis movie is pretty enjoyable, it would be better with a side of opiates though.‚Äù

‚ÄúMan! What a relaxing shower after a hard day‚Äôs work, ahhh nothing could make this any better, well‚Ä¶ aside from heroin.‚Äù

I think you get the picture. Mr. D was looking at repercussions a different way. In essence, he expected there to be an asterisk next to everything good that happened afterwards, denoting, ‚ÄúWell, not as good as heroin.‚Äù

At the time, I did think he had a good point, but I didn‚Äôt think he was entirely correct. I thought someone who tried heroin could probably compartmentalize each life experience afterwards and judge each experience on it‚Äôs own merit rather that how it fared compared to heroin.

Only problem there was that I was wrong.

It absolutely can diminish some of my more relaxing or pleasurable activities I do today. For example, maybe after a tough day laying in bed the idea creeps in ‚Äúthis would be way better opiated.‚Äù Or the glow after sex, ‚Äúthis is kind of like a heroin rush, but heroin would last way longer.‚Äù 

Before I proceed, I just want to be clear that these are very minute, fleeting, subconscious feelings of ‚Äúit could be better.‚Äù They aren't actually thoughts that I‚Äôm saying to myself in my head. That would make it more like a craving. I can‚Äôt express enough how different this is from a craving. There‚Äôs no emotion or urges tied to it.

A long time ago, I watched a CNN documentary about a guy was about to die from a heart complication. He had only a matter of hours or days left. Then one doctor came out of nowhere and was willing to do an experimental surgery on him, and it ended up saving his life. The guy said he went into that surgery expecting he was never going to wake up. And then when he did wake up and realized he was going to survive, it was the happiest and most exhilarating moment of his entire life--which means a lot coming from a 70 year old.

When I saw this I was like, ‚ÄúDamn, I get that feeling several times per week. Sitting in my car, hardcore withdrawing, desperate, panicking. Literally feeling like I‚Äôm going to die. Then I get the ‚Äúcome thru‚Äù text and I am on top of the fucking world.‚Äù

Whether it‚Äôs that or simply shooting up, that kind of euphoric exhilaration is absolutely unparalleled. I have yet to find a thing, person, place or thing that can instantaneously have me believing that all my problems were gone and I was on top of the world like these kind of instances did. That kind of instant gratification just doesn't exist outside of chemical manipulation of your neurotransmitters, in my personal experience at least. 

I sometimes do miss those times. But I am glad they‚Äôre gone, because with the highs come the lows. But, funny enough, the lows in my addiction are what help me the most now.

Which brings me to the flipside of this concept--in the same way that my addiction has been able to make certain things comparatively less enjoyable, it has, to an ever greater extent, made almost everything in my life comparatively less worrisome, troublesome, and unpleasant. This has helped improve my life drastically. I‚Äôm more comfortable in my skin, more confident, less fearful and anxious.

It‚Äôs hard for anything to really phase me like it would have before my addiction. Anything, and I mean anything, I might have to struggle though today is exponentially easier in comparison than the shit I had to endure in the worst of my addiction. 

Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain? Meh, I'll suck it up and get it done, no biggie. 
Have to change a car tire on the freeway in the rain‚Ä¶ in withdrawal?! Fuck. That. Noise. 

Have to walk down the street to get the mail? Minor inconvenience, possibly even enjoyable.
Have to walk down the street to get the mail, while you know there‚Äôs people out there looking to fuck you up because you haven‚Äôt paid them back yet? Ah, yeah, i‚Äôll wait ‚Äòtill it‚Äôs dark. 

Get pulled over by a cop for busted tail light? Whatever, take the fixit ticket. 
Get pulled over by a cop for a busted taillight, with a quarter ounce of freshly copped dope under your seat.? Time to start panicking.

These are just a few easier examples. This idea even extends to things that don‚Äôt have a direct situational comparison.

Boss yelling at me for something I had no part in? The world will not end. It won‚Äôt even ruin my day now.

Loosing my job? That would freak me out before, that shit wouldn‚Äôt even affect my sleep now. I lost more jobs in my addiction than I can count. And if I got through it then, I can definitely get through it now.

Can't pay rent because my shity minimum wage job is cutting hours? Eh, not ideal, but I can handle it. I‚Äôll crash at my sister‚Äôs or just sleep comfortably in my car for a bit. Nothing too bad. What‚Äôs bad is living on the streets in the winter with no money, dealing with cops, having to steal to get drugs, having to look over my shoulder.

The ups and downs I went through in my addiction have had the unintended effect of centering me, insofar as the relatively minor ups and downs of my life today seem so god damn insignificant. And if you've never felt that way before, let me tell you, that feeling is empowering as fuck! I feel more like a rock now and less like a feather. I feel more solid, my emotions are not subject to whichever way the wind blows.

So all in all, there are some negative consequences from my drug use that have persisted, but they are far outweighed by the positives I‚Äôve taken away. There was a point in my life, when I was living in a small walk-in closet of a trap house, in withdrawal, out of money, no health insurance, freezing cold, fleas everywhere, trying to sleep and failing, anxious, desperate, and demoralized. I had lost everyone who ever cared about me, no one would talk to me anymore. When I felt beyond lost, at an impasse, with only one more option available. For the first time in my life, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúBeing dead wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.‚Äù 

When it comes down to it, fear is useful for us as humans because it helps keeps us alive. But what if we no longer want to be alive, what then? Well, then fear loses its main purpose, and it feels a bit lighter. I felt comfort in that. Looking back, it was in this moment that I learned fear was more a condition of perception rather than something intrinsic. It was optional. And nothing but going to the deepest, darkest place would have been able to show me that. 

No longer in my addiction, there is no outside circumstance in the universe that could make me feel the way I felt that night. All of life's problems seem so insignificant in comparison to the time that was so bad that death was a better alternative to living. There is no person, no situation, no circumstance today that could rival the utter hopelessness of what I felt that night. And the fact that I survived that makes me feel like I can survive anything.

You are the only one that can decide if your life will be better without opiates. I‚Äôm not here to tell you my life was bad, now it is good, and you're stupid if you don't live the way I do. I just wanted to share with you something I learned along the way, something that has had a positive impact on my life. And the cool part is that it‚Äôs just a perspective--not a program, or a step, or a self-help booklet. Just a different way of looking at the struggles you may be going through. It doesn't have to be that you are broken because of what you've been through, it can be that you  are stronger because of it.

Strong swords are forged in fire. Keep that in mind.

Smoking it gave such a rush and instantly felt a warm blanket surround me, after time of smoking it wouldn't effect the same so I smoked/snorted but once a few days off of it smoking would give a similar first time experience. Unlike fent, the withdrawls do not come until around 24 hours. Do they say white China on the east coast isn't smoke able because people just don't do that or does it literally not burn/cause smoke? Lately I've been hearing about down the boarder they have been making white, and slowly it's getting around the west coast... Could this just be some complete different kind of white they made that is smokeable? Basically I want to know what I got, so I can know what I'm looking for.

I'd vowed to never do one without the other, but I fail that every time I try to quit opiates but that combination is a total match made in heaven. 

What confuses me though is the sheer contrast of it all. For example, I distinctly remember trying, buying and then smoking a new brand of cigarettes (idk if you guys have Winston Blues there)  that seemed really good while I was all fucked up on Oxy, but the next day all out of drugs I had a puff on one of my final Winstons and it was fucking gross. I ended up giving the rest of them away for a single Marlboro, I couldn't bear the taste of them. 

This has been something that's happened to me many times. Don't get me wrong either, I am not at all a picky smoker - I'm not one of these ""I only exclusively smoke Lucky Strike and will go through nicotine withdrawals before taking a puff of anything else"" assholes. On heroin, good cigarettes & tobacco tastes like the pussy of the holy spirit, and even awful tobacco & cigs will taste fine. 

So it's not just the fact that they feel better or that the nicotine buzz is enhanced and has a lovely synergy with opiates - although by god that is all correct - but its honestly as if the actual physical taste of the things change. It's weird because IME for everything else my sense of taste is slightly dulled on opiates, but the taste of cigarettes changes radically for the better.

Pain Management has always interested me. Do you just walk in for an appointment about pain and get prescribed opiates, do you have to have proof of something like a car accident, are you referred by a doctor only after complaining for a year? 
I‚Äôm sick of being a junkie copping a gram of H at a time but one big reason I always go back after getting clean is having a bad day where my back is killing me. (And craving drugs, I‚Äôm not gonna kid myself.) But I can get through the cravings.

I say that because in the past when I dabbled with oxy I would purchase 100 at a time and do them daily until they were gone without any desire to purchase more.

It has been gruelling, exhilarating, rewarding, punishing and not as big a deal as people would have you believe. I just need to get some shit off my chest and whose collective shoulder to cry on could be better than my fellow rejects' ? I'm hoping to demystify the billion-dollar industry that is recovery with this post, and who knows some of you might get inspired to turn your lives around or at least try (because Lord do I know that my shit is far from fixed).


First thing I noticed is that the key to sober life is basically dividing your day into little segments, carefully balancing responsibilities and leisure time. It doesn't have to be rocket surgery, you're in recovery so treat yourself to whatever hobbies you'd like to indulge in. Don't overburden yourself with a million goals, like losing weight, getting swole, fixing your legal and financial shit all at the same time. It's paramount to happiness that you set attainable goals (fucking Anthony Robbins over here, I know). I just read a bunch, listen to lots of music and watch lots of TV. I socialize at work, do some online dating and that's that. It's hilariously uncomplicated in comparison to shooting dope and coke daily, but this leads us to the next lesson.


Life is gonna get boring. How could it not be? There simply are no better feelings than shooting hard drugs. So you really need to come to terms with the fact that you'll never get the same peaks of unadulterated euphoria again. This pissed me off to no end at first, but after a while, I settled in. The highs may not be as intense, but they're more sustainable. I love reading, and no it will never get me as happy as a shot of good coke, but it won't break me as a person as much either, not by a long shot. So you need to visualize how a mediocre, content life (by junkie standards of course) can be made appealing to you.


And finally. FUCK COCAINE. If you have a coke habit as well as a heroin habit, I got good and bad news for you. First, you won't crave dope as much as you're afraid you might. However, the coke cravings are *real*. Every now and then, I'm overwhelmed by the immense need for a bellringer. Some trivial things which triggered this feeling:

- the vague smell of fuel
- bouts of nausea
- glass tubes
- any white powder period
- ringing/pressure in my ears

All this shit takes me back to last year: sitting on my bed, geeking so hard I'm unable to move, breathing hard, my heart about to give out, vomiting and loading a new shot of girl every ten minutes. Oh I'm still suffering the consequences: my veins are fucked. I never had a problem finding places to hit until I started fucking with coke.


So yeah, fuck cocaine. It's the real devil to beat, at least for me.",1510782692.0

I'm currently almost 6 months sober living in a recovery house. I was using heroin everyday for a few months (sniffed) and got up to about 1-1.5 g's daily because I didn't do anything but use. I didn't work (stole to fund habit) didn't go out just simply sat and used. I have a job right now, 50 hrs week as a cook and about to get a raise so I'd be getting close to 500/week. I'm really bored all the time, I have found some comfort in AA but i feel like it's not enough. Now maybe that's just my brain saying it would like endorphins and that I shouldn't be living a regular life, but i just don't see myself staying clean long term. Not because I can't do it, but because I just don't enjoy it especially once I move out of my recovery house and have a lot more responsibilities and bills.

 I have been talking to my old plug because I really want to use, but I've been torn due to my newfound stability and my family talking to me and stuff is nice. That's really it though. My plan would be to use every once in a while(I don't get drug tested so I'd just have to get high at night when no one would notice in my room) so like once a week or so. I have two back up plans in case I do get caught which would be to go to a detox for 2 days and come back to recovery house (house rules, not an Oxford house) or to move in with my plug who said I can if I have to. The rent at his place would be 350$ a month which is nothing and it would be easy to pick up lol. Anyway that's all the info. What should I do?

Tell him I need help and ask him to come get me. Sunday comes and he's here, helping me pack and throw away all my stuff. We head back to his house Monday morning. The past few days haven't been completely horrible. No sleep Monday night with restless legs and pools of sweat. But last night, I actually got some sleep. Last night I didn't wake up drenched in sweat. I got up at 7:30 as I could fall back asleep. Came downstairs and talked with my step mom. Told her how I slept, and that I am feeling better physically and already a little mentally. Yesterday I was depressed and didn't see a possibility of my life being successful. Today, as I was sitting outside smoking a cig, breathing the chilly air, the sun in full brightness, I felt good. I felt positive. I felt like I'm overcoming this disease and that there is hope for my life to be something again. I still have a lot of work to do, and a whole lot of debt to pay off, but I have a new outlook and positivity that I haven't felt in a very long time. Today, I feel good. Today, I feel positive. Today, I feel confident that I can conquer this recovery.  Today, I have hope.",1510762366.0
