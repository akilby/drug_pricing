Now normally I walk 0.5 miles a day to get to my fentanyl dealer .  Now there is a methadone clinic in Kearny NJ & that’s only 0.6 miles from my house so I tried to go there first but I’ve been calling them for about a month now all they would do is take my info & say we’ll call you back tomorrow with an assessment date , or worst they would tell me to call back in 1 hour or if I called early they would say call back at 12:30 but they close at 12.... & Well I never got a call & I’ve been calling them for 3 and a half weeks now I’m desperately trying to get into a clinic . 
     
      So today I get on the phone with a lady that seemed very much mad because I’ve been calling back so often & when I tell her that her employees have been giving me the run around she says “idk how that’s possible nobody that works for me would say that to you”. & after I gave her the names of employees she said .  “ so what’s the point of your call ? & I told her I’m desperately trying to get on methadone & she responds with “ well there’s a waiting list , so it’s going to take anywhere from 6 months to a year and a half or more before we can have you come in for an assessment .. 
     I was shocked that a state run program that’s suppose to help the people would have a waiting list that long . I proceeded to tell her that I’ll most likely be dead from my addiction before I even get a chance to come in & she just said “well you got to think positive” “if you really want to be clean so bad just do it at home “ I couldn’t believe what I was hearing from this person , I explained to her that I’m on a large amount of fentanyl & I can’t do it at home I physically cannot go 7-10 days no sleep & I need help very badly , there is no way you could Atleast make an appointment  and see me in person & possibly make an exception ? She said absolutely not that wouldn’t be fair to the other people on the list & it would just be a waste of time . 


    I 
got off the phone in tears cause I’m just so hopeless thinking about being able to surviving this drug addiction . & how could a person that works at a clinic be so cruel? She knows I’m only 20y/o & she treated me so badly . I was very polite & basically begged her to help me . She even told me to stop wasting my employees time calling all the time . She said , trust me we’ll call you when it’s time . So my question is are all places like this ??? Is there normally a waiting list ? The closest other place is another 3 miles away & there’s no way I could make it there every day & be able to make it to work by 10am . Plus it would defeat the purpose because i’d have to walk past atleast 8-10 dope spots before I get to the clinic .

Many of the addicts were just kids, 14 year olds trying to take the edge off after a hard day of child labor; but people from all walks of life were drawn to the poppy siren's call. 

Like, I want to know what that was like, just being able to go into a dollar store to buy something that's seen as so dangerous and taboo now. I want to know what those people thought when they took that cough drop that made their boring lives suddenly wonderful. Or what about the pharmacists thought about selling people this very powerful drug.

There was a very nice entry about Heroin in the Oxford companion to United States history, but I want to know more, like legit historical anecdotes and shit.",1521349029.0

In the ambulance they gave me 100mcg of fentanyl and then another 100mcg about 30-40min later at the hospital.

I don't do opiates for fun and haven't had any from accidents for like at least 5 years. Never had fentanyl before. So no tolerance. 

However, despite the nurse saying it was the strongest painkiller available, it did pretty much nothing for my pain. I felt more relaxed mentally and way less stressed out about the accident which made it easier to tolerate the pain, but my pain level was about the same even after the second dose.

Any thoughts on why it didn't help me much? Was the dose too small? (I'm 135lbs) Was it because I was just in too much pain and the injury was so recent?

(Later on, when I was stabilized, they put me on a course of 10mg Oxycotin, 30mg cyclobenaprine, and 2mg hydromrphone. That combo together finally made the pain go down to a manageable level but I was still very alert and felt pretty normal mentally.)",1521343575.0

I’m glad people had success and loved it. 

I was starting to get really annoyed by all the false information spread around about dabbing bth. Not just on Reddit but on the internet. It’s definitely an alternative way to smoke. The rush is way different than smoking on foil. I feel like that’s why I’m not really into IV because dabbing is enough of a rush for me. I actually know two people that stopped shooting because I introduced them to dabbing tar. I was surprised that they put down a needle and bought a dab rig instead. Usually people can’t put a needle down but my two friends said they really enjoyed the rush from dabs and they don’t have to spend an hour trying to find a vein anymore. I know that this can only be done with tar tho....not ECP. There’s not too many people that I know in real life that still smoke on foil. Most people I know graduated to IV very quickly looking for a better high. With dabs one of the biggest misconceptions is you have to use more dope when dabbing but that’s not true at all. I mean when I first started I kinda did go thru more dope but that’s because I didn’t have anyone walk me thru the process. I would put like 3 points on the dab stick! And just burn it all away like a dumbass lol 

Anyways I’m glad some of you guys enjoyed your dabs. I hope I was clear enough in my guide and you guys understood everything. I tried my best to explain the process. Someone who tried this method out yesterday can only get opium pretty much and I told him he could probably try it and he loved it! He tried it with his E-nail and said it was an amazing rush.

So many years ago i had gotten out of rehab and had nowhere to go, moved with my partna to *usa* but that didnt work, so it was off to usa to live with my best friend who had been forced to move to usa where his uncle had a carpet business after his 3rd dui. We were both only 21 and 22 at the time he had been racking them up since HS.  Luckily he had already been in durham for 6 or 8 months, ""clean"", and just got a nice new 1br apartment after having lived with his strict ass uncle since he got there. I hadnt seen him in months...wasnt sure what to expect. (For reference lets call  my boy W.)

Welp i walk in the door after catching a greyhound from usa to usa and its a reunion. Hes got like 4 norcos on the counter (5s) and maybe a blue football or two but the second i laid eyes on him i knew. Motherfucker has been doing good and has started to get his shit together but has the itch to go hard bad. Once we split the hydros (that was my test since i was pretty fresh out of rehab - long term Scientology rehab) he broke out the dope. I was ecstatic. Unfortunately he followed with ""i think this shits fake. I got it from a hooker out of the yellow pages but  it doesnt get me high."" I do a shot its bunk. I said youve been here how many months and don't have a connect? I was always the resourceful part of the team. We were best friends since 9th grade (him a year ahead of me at a diff school). Sniffed our first bag together my senior year. Shot  up together a year later. Crashed and burned. I started to understand why he wanted me to move to usa so bad...he knew id sniff out some dope. And i did before long. I also made a bunch of local junkie acquaintances thru bluelight topix and opiophile and before long we was strung out again.

Someone had got us some bags from usa that were bomb...and i got the dudes number who sold it. Honestly we were gonna rob the guy and he sensed it and would not meet me even tho i called every day for two weeks. We had a local plug who was cool...hood ass usa dude always with his sidekick poo or his gf (who i still talk to 7 or 8 yrs later. This was when mephedrone hit  scene we got big into IV 4mmc i have some stories from that)...but this other guys dope was a 10/10 plus it was gonna be free so finally he agreed to meet me. But he was sending a runner. Some chick. Even better i thought but he wouldnt send her with anymore than like 8 20 bags.

My boy W had a big white van from his carpet job and we drove to the meet spot at walmart and honestly we had the tools and were gonna kidnap this chick. She calls as we pull up and throws a curveball wanting me to go inside the store with her and buy cigs since she had no ID. I hop out and she is waiting under the flag pole  front like she said...i guess my dumbass fell in love. Didnt rob her.  Sweet talked her out the dope she brought (turns out the d boy was her ex) and set up a date for the next night.

A bonnie and clyde situation ensued. Engaged. Im tired of typing she turned out to be awful.",1521318981.0

Some of you may have seen my post a week and a half back about finding my boyfriend dead, but for those of you who didn't, I'll give you a little back story. My boyfriend and I met when I was struggling to get clean. We used together a few times. Then I got on vivitrol but he would still want to use once in awhile. He had no dealer and asked me to get it for him. In exchange I made him promise never to do it without me there with narcan, and to never try to learn to inject - only let me hit him if he had to use that way.


Well this went fine for awhile. We had some stupidly good times with him goofy and happy on dope and me just shaking my head at the nostalgia.

Two weekends ago that all changed. We had another similar weekend, except my vivitrol was due to be redone on monday and I, knowing that I had a brief window to get high, wanted to participate. We bought a few grams and blasted through them saturday, having a pretty good time although I noticed with us both using we fought kind of a lot. 

Well of course sunday rolls around and we are out of dope and the junkie that I am thinks ""This is the last day I can get high"" so I tell him I'm gonna go get more. He says no, practically begs me not to go, saying oh haven't you had enough etc. I was of course mad because he had been high as a kite and I hadn't even caught a bit of a nod because of vivitrol. So anyway, in a decision that haunts my every waking moment I convinced him to let me go pick up more, and I successfully got fucked up.

I left monday morning. The dope was, to the best of my knowledge, completely gone except a tiny amount which I left in two lines for him. Enough for him to get a decent high on but DEFINITELY not enough to overdose.

I gave him a kiss and left for my vivitrol appointment.
The rest of the day was spotty. We barely talked. The same was true tuesday. Then communication just ceased.

When friday rolled around and I still hadn't heard from him I drove up there with wine and flowers to try to fix things. I found him dead on the floor with a needle two spoons on the dresser. The weird thing is only one of the lines I had left him had been done. However, one of the spoons was full of cotton balls. I don't know where he got the idea to use spoons because when I would hit him I never prepped in spoons, always like bottle caps or whatever. And I NEVER did a cotton shot in front of him so I have no idea where he learned how todo that. But he did have an ex girlfriend who was actively using so maybe it was her? My theory is he tried to do a cotton shot but used all the cottons we had used over the entire weekend which was like a half fingers worth of dope and immediately died.


I feel so fucking responsible I want to die. The guilt in my heart is gutwrenching. I let heroin back into his life. He was the love of my life. I have never loved as fiercely as I loved him. And my carelesslessness lead to his death. My addiction lead to his death. If we had just used saturday like he wanted it would have all been gone and he'd still be here. But I just had to have more sunday. I fucking hate myself.

I made stupid excuses, believing that if I gave him a safe space where he could use that he would stick to using in it with me. That he would just call me to come over and I'd be there with narcan. I've already lost one person I love to OD and I told him that saturday how terrified I was of losing him. 

I think it had to do with our arguing that weekend. I hit a nerve when I mentioned something political that really got him mad at me and set off all these issues, and I think he just wasn't feeling as close to me as usual.

Whatever the reason, he chose to use and is dead now. I found his body March 9th. I've done my best to come to grips with it but I don't think I can. I've been drinking almost a handle every night. I deleted all my dealers numbers in fury two days after his death, then a few days ago in an act of misery tried to cold cop and ended up getting robbed (lol). The only thing that has helped has been round the clock xanax, which I started taking four days ago but just ran out today. I'm getting more thursday, but honestly I don't know if it's enough.

I really want to just find a new dealer, mix it with some benzos and end this shit. I know life is beautiful but I fucked mine. I didn't give my boyfriend the gun, to speak metaphorically, he already had it. But I gave him back the ammo. I let heroin back into his life and it killed him and I don't think I can live with myself this way.

 This isn't about depression. I've struggled with depression all my life and that's not what this is. I know because when I exercise vigorously (which I do every day) my depression is alleviated for the rest of the day. This isn't. This is a pain like someone stabbed me in the chest that never stops.  

Do any of you have any similar experiences? If so, how did you get through it? Suicide really feels like the only option. People say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, but this problem isn't temporary. For the rest of my life I will have to live with the knowledge that I casually let heroin back into my boyfriend's life and he is now dead because of it. I am so guilty and so sorry.

Help me please. I want to kill myself so badly but I don't want my family to go through that. They've already been through so much because of what a fuck up I am.

You are all wonderful. <3",1521483685.0

12 years struggling w/opiates, dope, pills, methadone, subs

I tried a few times in the last few weeks to successfully switch off methadone to a fast acting opiate (dope) and then to bupe (subs) and failed. I’ve spent hundreds of dollars maintaining myself to get to work and other engagements and have thrown myself into precipitated withdrawal also. So each time I have gotten to 12-16 hours with nothing I get scared I’m taking the sub too early because I can’t seem to wait longer than that.

I know people say I need to get bars or something to keep calm but I haven’t found any. I just want out of this life. I found two different inpatient rehabs that state insurance covers in my state. And I know, it’s not one of those weekend detox places that all of our friends have scared us away from. One place is a week and the other is 30 days. None of my family or friends (who don’t use) know I even have a problem so I decided to go with 5-7 day one and hope they don’t try to contact me and call, just in case my phone is off. 

I also smoke MMJ and don’t think they will let me bring it (although they said bring all prescriptions with you...😝) and I’m a little worried about not being to sleep or eat without it but I’m also very excited about the possibilities. This morning when I got off the phone and made the appt for tomorrow morning I cried. I guess I am scared and nervous and excited. 

Their site says they use clonodine and suboxone. I know that I’d like to be off of everything but even getting me successfully inducted into suboxone will be a huge win!! 

Anyone have any experience w state covered rehabs? 
Any advice?
Last time I went to rehab was 8 years ago, I was forced and this time it’s my choice and I’m very excited and happy to not have to be a slave to dope or methadone anymore. ",1521482465.0

Benzo'd myself out for the next 24 hours until 5pm the next day. I wasn't feeling that sick but wasn't feeling that great either. So I took about 4mg of sub, 2 insufflated and 2 sublingually. Didn't feel much of anything. About an hour later I cop a half G of black and smoke maybe a half of that. I felt a little bit better. I woke up this morning (Monday) and felt not wonderful but by no means shitty at all. I smoked a point or two of tar this morning. Am I safe to use sub again? Wouldn't the sub still be on my receptors from Sunday night? 
       
        I know this sounds stupid but I just needed the ""familiarity"" of smoking my black, idk I am an addict its hard to explain. But that's why I copped the half, and the sub wasn't helping, as it often doesn't at first but I didn't want to miss work the next day or feel shitty for when my gf was coming over that night. 
         
       I have been reading up and some internet sites say that smoking or using your DOC after induction gets rid of the residuals, thus making the first day MUCH easier. However, I am wondering if I can use my sub after this now? It has barely been 12 hours so I should be able to use my sub even after using this morning right? ",1521478975.0

I don't think you will be able to help, but I have to talk about this to someone. About 6 months ago I was pulled over, long story short they found my H and arrested me for DUI. I failed the field sobriety test but refused the blood test, boom license instantly suspended for a year.

I've been dealing with that since, but doing really fucking well at my white-collar job. Stuff was taking forever at the courthouse, but luckily I had a lawyer and in that county in NC you only need a lawyer present for most preceedings, so I was having him run it. He told me he thought I would only get unsupervised probation, because it was my first offense. So, when my company told me they wanted me to move to NYC to start up a team there, I accepted on a flexible timeline so I could get some ""personal stuff"" figured out.

Well, on Friday my lawyer went in again, and they're charging me with two felonies: possession of H and Maintaining a Vehicle for the Purpose of Transporting H. Holy shit. I've never been in any legal trouble before, and now I'm looking at being a felon. He says these are ""unserved warrants"", whatever that means. Sounds different from outstanding warrants, but I'm going to ask him to follow up.

No idea how I will be able to work this out and still keep my job/keep my move. I'm so fucked up right now. Terrified and paralyzed. I guess... don't do drugs kids.",1521469730.0

I had just finished up the last of my midterms and decided that I would make the hour and a half drive back home for the weekend to see my family and the couple of friends I had who hadn’t gone off to college after graduation.  Plus I had almost run out of my supply of oxy, and it was so much cheaper buying them from my old connect back home than it was buying off of the few random frat bros that sold them on campus.  This was back in 2009, right after Purdue pharma changed the formula to the shitty OPs, so real 80s were getting to be prohibitively expensive and harder and harder to come by.  I told myself that I would buy at least half a script worth so I could sell them on campus for a decent profit, but I knew in the back of my head that it would never happen – because it never did.  Besides selling a few to a couple of my close friends, I pretty much always ended up blowing through my whole stash myself... and in much less time than I had always planned. 
Heroin was definitely around, but I still hadn’t made the permanent switch as I was still able to afford my oxy habit.  

I ran up to my dorm room to pack some clothes and my computer, grabbing my little drug kit on the way out the door.  When I got to my car I immediately popped the last 80 I had into my mouth, swishing it around for a few seconds before spitting it back out onto my shirt which I used to rub off the coating.  Most of the shirts that I wore were covered in green and red stains from rubbing the coating off of the 80s and 60s I had grown to love so much.  I dug around in the center console for my trusty ped-egg before realizing that I had left it at a friend’s house the night before, so I was forced to use the small hose clamp that I always carried in my wallet.  I shucked up around 40mg, using an old Applebee’s gift card to divide the fluffy white powder into two equal lines, quickly snorting each line up either nostril after glancing around the parking lot to make sure nobody could see me.  And with that I hit play on my driving playlist and pulled out of the student parking lot and drove toward the highway that would take me home.  It was around 10:30 when I passed the Bloomington city limits.

It was an exceptionally smooth drive down the two-lane highway that took me toward my hometown up until around the 45 minute mark, just after passing through one of the many small towns on the route.  A lot of cops use those small towns as speed traps since the speed limit quickly changes from 55 down to 30 before most people have the chance to slow all the way down, so I wasn’t too surprised when I saw the bright light in my rear view coming toward me from the town. 

“Goddammit, just what I fucking need,” I said aloud.  But before I had a chance to start slowing down the bright light disappeared just as quickly as it had appeared.  I thought it was a little strange but dismissed it as a redneck pickup truck with spotlights fucking around or something.  

About five minutes later my music suddenly stopped and the audio input quickly cycled through all of the different options a few times before settling on the FM radio which was omitting a weird high-pitched static that I hadn’t heard before. It certainly wasn’t the regular static noise normally associated with radio. But before I could reach to turn down the volume the car’s dome light started to rapidly turn itself on and off, quickly followed by the flickering of the glowing green light that illuminated the dash.

“Fucking perfect,” I said to myself. 

I had just gotten the car back from the shop for an issue with the electrical system, and it was looking like they had fucked it up even more instead of fixing it.  I decided I was going to pull off onto the next county road, but before I could slow down the same bright light from before reappeared in my rearview – this time a hell of a lot closer and at least 20 or 30 feet above the road. 

“What the fuck… that’s not rednecks,” I thought. 

I was suddenly overtaken with a sickening fear, the only thought in my head being to get the fuck out of there. With my heart pounding, I floored the gas and took off down the highway as fast as I could – the bright light rapidly approaching from behind.  All I could think was “what the fuck” over and over again as the light caught up to me.  I slammed on the brakes and took a sharp right onto one of the country roads, spinning my tires and shooting everywhere as I floored the gas yet again.  But before I could get back up to speed the engine suddenly died and I coasted to a stop with the bright light hovering directly overhead practically blinding me.  I instantly locked the doors and grabbed for my phone.  The last thing I remember seeing is the time on phone’s screen: 11:23pm.

I opened my eyes and saw the brilliant night sky of the middle of nowhere central Indiana.  It was a completely clear night and being so far from any city lights I was able to make out the beautiful glow of the milky way.  After a few seconds of foggy confusion, I realized that I was freezing and instantly started to shiver as I sat up and took stock of my surroundings.  I was sitting in the middle of a muddy cornfield with absolutely nothing around for what seemed like miles.  

“Whaaaat. The. Fuuuuck,” was the only thing I could think as I stood up, trying my best not to panic.  I could see what looked to be headlights off in the distance - driving down what I hoped was the same highway that I was on.  I started walking across the field parallel to the highway until I finally stumbled on a country road which I followed toward the direction of the headlights that I could still see in the distance.  After walking for what seemed like miles, but in reality was only about one mile I spotted my car on the side of the road.  I honestly don’t think I had ever been so relieved in my life.  I jogged up to my car, praying that the battery wouldn’t be dead and that the car would start.  I jumped in the driver seat, turning the keys in the ignition.  To my immense relief it turned over immediately and the engine came roaring to life.

“Thank fuck,” I said to myself, pulling the car around to face the highway.  Before I left I broke out the last half of my 80 and shucked it down faster than I ever thought possible, quickly snorting the fat line in one go.  I was about to pull onto the highway when I saw something that stopped me dead in my tracks.  The time on the car’s clock was reading 4:37 AM.  I was out there for over five fucking hours.  

To this day I still have absolutely no idea what happened to me that night – and it definitely wasn’t the last strange happening I experienced in the backroads of rural Indiana.  I’ve only told this story to one other person because I know exactly how it sounds… fucking crazy, or made-up.  Or both.  After that night I never drove that stretch of road by myself ever again.

Last week on 03/14 I was in the hospital and was given IV morphine from the Dr. However this weekend on 03/ 18 I used about half a gram of heroin smoked. So two questions. Can the lab test tell the differance between morphine and heroin? Also my P.O does know I was given morphine at the hospital. However that would have been 9 days from the date I was given it and date of my test so even with a Dr. excuse do you believe PO will call my bullshit since it has been 9 days from a single dose.

She asked me if I had any special secrets that healthcare professionals where keep from the pts or something?! Unfortunately I told her I did not know anything besides the good old fashioned stool softener, fiber, water, laxative, and OIC specific medications etc. Well this is when she decided to tell me the method she’s been using to rid her body of shit (literally). I’m paraphrasing here but basically she went on to tell em about her struggles and that many times it becomes so bad for her that she would have to come into the ER for a manual dis-impaction. Overtime time she began to experiment and came to the realization that she could insert her finger into her vaginal opening and she could help to push down on the vaginal wall. She then felt the stool backed up and she would use the pressure from her hand to guide the fecal material out of the anus while simultaneous straining to help “expel it out” I unfortunately have not tested this removal method for myself however when thinking about what she said.... she’s not wrong. Based on what we know about basic human anatomy this should be 100% legit and ultimately another method and a tool in an attempt to help females combat this terrible side effect.

85gmbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/85gmbs/literally_every_single_problem_of_opiate_use/,193,https://redd.it/85gmbs,Mu_Kappa_Delta,Literally every single problem of opiate use stems from it's illegality.,"Here's some facts for those who haven't done the research themselves:

Opiates (as in, the opioid agonists that are related to the poppy plant's natural alkaloids; phenanthrene based opioids) have zero toxic effect on the body. Unlike amphetamines and cocaine, they have no negative effect on the cardiovascular system (in fact they lower blood pressure). They cause zero neurotoxicity. They don't fuck up the way the frontal lobes function. Unlike benzos, they don't have fatal withdrawals. They have almost no function on cognition in normal doses, in sub nod doses opiates have almost no effect on cognition besides your mood.

The endorphin system is the ultimate source of pleasure. Every drug in existence ultimately causes pleasure through the endorphin path way. Opiates just hit this pathway directly and avoids any other effects. Opiates are the cleanest and purist drug there is for euphoria and positive mood.

The only negatives I can think of for opiates are 

1. Lowering of sex hormones
2. Lowering of cortisol/stress hormones
3. Increasing histamine (which stops at a certain point)
4. Constipation 

These are the only physical problems opiates cause themselves.

""But what about the problems injecting and snorting cause? What about overdoses""

Well those are from lack of clean dope, lack of money (and thus dope needs to be used as efficiently as possible), lack of clean equipment.

All problems with opiates ultimately comes down to two issues: money stress (main issue), and unregulated dope.

Money stress is the reason opiate addicts steal, the reason they lie, the reason they do bad things to go money/dope, the reason they start injecting, the reason they lose their job, etc. 

And unregulated product is the reason they overdose.

If opiates could be produced as any other product on the market, like tobacco, then a gram of heroin could easily be sold for $20. Imagine going to the gas station and buying a g of heroin for $20. Imagine how much simpler that'd make your life. 

And sadly, the opiate maintenance medications are awful in comparison to opiates like heroin or oxy. Methadone is cardiotoxic and has very negative effects on cognition because of it's NMDA antagonism. Buprenorphine has all of the side effects of heroin, yet none of the euphoria, and has a withdrawal 10x longer and worse than it. Plus, these medications are expensive, and methadone is extremely inconvenient (for many it can be equivalent to a 2 hour commute to work and back, which is devastating for an opiate addict trying to get back on their feet).

I see a lot of guilty opiate addicts, often ones who've done nothing wrong (like stealing), but who're just guilty from using dope alone. Don't be, you've done absolutely nothing morally wrong at all. Using heroin has no moral effect on you.

I see people trying to quit from guilt, I see people in OpiateRecovery desperately deluding themselves into thinking that they're happier now that they'r off heroin. I'm not saying quitting is bad. it is necessary for many people in this illegal environment.

The reason your life is so hard is because the rest of society is allowing blatant discrimination (on a level comparable to previous racial injustices) against you. You should be furious. 

This isn't the ramblings of an opiate addict, in fact I don't use opiates at all (besides kratom, which is an opioid). The bare minimum should be opiate decrimnilization. I'm not sure if full legality is ever possibility in the US within the, I don't see that happening for 20 years, but hey look at how far cannabis has gotten.

What we need is for opiate addicts to stop feeling guilty, to stop helping the governments/societies blatant disregard for human rights. They need to be as loud as possible.

Edit: and the thing is, not only is there solid logic and theory to support what I'm saying, but also direct real life case studies done in Europe and Canada where it's been proven beyond a doubt that heroin maintenance is the best form of treatment there is.

And there's something similar in the USA: opioid maintenance therapy, which is by far the most successful opiate addiction treatment there is. Nothing comes close AT ALL. No other treatment works besides OMT. The highest level of success in any of the other treatments is like 10%, OMT has success rates of 75%+. And those numbers are just for the relapse rates. The 90% that relapse in the other treatments have the typical lives of a junkie; the 75%+ of OMT have normal lives. And the drugs given for OMT are absolute shit when compared to opiates.",1521430665.0

I go to a clinic that doses subutex, suboxone, and methadone. My best friend also goes to this clinic, and she gets four take homes a week of subutex. When she has to go in to dose, she takes the sub under the tongue like you are supposed to from what I understand, but the four take homes that she gets, she ends up snorting. Total of 8 mg a day snorted, I think 4 mg twice a day. I’ve never done it, I’ve heard it’s unpleasant, but I’ve also heard that buprenorphine has a better bioavailability when insufflated. 

So my questions are, is there anything inherently unsafe about this aside from the sinus damage that snorting anything can cause? Is there really a benefit? Is the bioavailability really higher when snorted? Is it somehow more habit forming? Because this girl doesn’t seem to be able to switch back to just taking it sublingually. 

She’s an adult, she can do what she wants, I’m just curious as to whether or not any of you have done this and what you think about it. ",1521412185.0

I moved to the South and was clean for about 2 months, until I found the holy 40mg pandas and decided I had to try it. 

Boyyy it was awesome, I’ve only done it about 4 times in the past month because it’s expensive down here for opana, like 100$ a 40mg. Well the panda kinda reignited my love for opiates and I decided I want to try H once and for all since my friend circle talks highly about it. Now when I was using Oxy, towards the end my girlfriend and I wanted to switch to H because of money, spending 600 a day for our habit is crazy. 

I had a good friend(before I moved) who was also a dboy, he would help me get pills occasionally when my plug was out, one day I asked if he could get me dope. He straight up said he’d rather not be the one to help me bc he didn’t want to further my addiction or take me down that road. That’s was about 4 months ago, 2 months before I decided to move 18 hours away. 

So after being down here for a bit and fucking with pandas I decided to ask a good friend to help me get some H. The prices are ridiculous being im from an east coast state bmore , I know the prices back home and they are double that down here, quite literally. I had purchased .2 thru my friend for 40$, should have been 20 back home lol. 

Well I get home, my girl decided she wanted to go first and I would wait a few minutes to make sure she was okay. We chopped up small bumps and she did one waited did one and waited, in about 10 minutes she says it’s def an opiate but it reminded her of Oxy as it was tame to her. Well I probably did about .13 and she did the other .07, we had .2 in all.

I did all mine within 20 minutes like she did, she looked visibly high an said it was good but not great. I on the other hand didn’t feel to much, I could feel the H wanting to get me high but I would start to get that opi feeling in my body and neck and it would just stop a few minutes in. Now she felt good for about 2 or 3 hours, we have the same tolerance(for all opiates we’ve done), but different body weight, her being 130 and me being 220. 

So I caught myself wondering why people get addicted to heroin if it’s just like pills or weaker, I couldn’t honestly say the H was better then Oxy, but I could say panda was better then both by far. 

Is the reason I didn’t get that high bc of tolerance? 
(Haven’t used in 2 weeks before this)
Maybe my body weight? 
Or maybe I just did so little it didn’t really affect me? 

Either way I am disappointed to say the least, I do want to give it another shot, but for the price and effect, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. This whole idea is crazy bc I was addicted to H before I even did it. I’d watch docs about it, have dreams I’m snorting H and getting a rush then waking up. I’ve wanted H for so long, that when I finally got it I was disappointed.

TLDR: Bought H for the first time, did over a .1 with weak tolerance , didn’t feel much(honestly), was disappointed how weak it felt, girlfriend was having good time on .07, told her I felt it was a waste bc I didn’t even get high",1521571919.0

I always like reading cold cop stories here so i figured you'd like this one of mine. Happened a few months ago

Now i don't cold cop. I've done it a few times but i have too much to lose for the risk

Was in a major city on business for the night but i don't live there and have to take public transit home. Last ride out is somewhere just before midnight. 

So the meeting lets out at about 8 and we're in a highly populated area but now I'm tossed and on my own. I'm usually too scared of getting arrested to ever try this but it isn't called liquid courage for nothing. I find a homeless guy nodding out on a sidewalk and offer him some of the cut if he can help me score some dope. He's a Latino guy around my age and happily obliges. We start walkin to his guy.

Bein drunk i violate rule 1 and give him the cash while he tells me to wait on a block. But i don't wait. I walk across the street following where he's going. After about 10 blocks i catch up w him thinking there's no reason to make me wait back there unless he's taking the money and running so i confront him. Get the $ back in my hand.  We end up in McDonalds after McDonalds talking to every fiend from the tall white hippie who looks like he'd scalp you for a dime to the fat old war vet with one and a half hands. 

He finds this chick and mumbles something to her and she asks me to follow her now. She's a long thin black woman with hoop earrings big enough to put a fist through. She's also a he. We take a silent awkward cab uptown and get out near this older black woman in a safety vest. She gives me a sample of something that feels like nothing to me and the tranny thinks that's funny as fuck. I follow both of em into a back alley where they smoke some rock (which they kindly offered me but i don't care for it and politely declined)

Finally we get to this crusty studio apt occupied by the sweetest old black couple as well as a dump trucks worth of garbage and a small tv. They were watching some history shit i think. I sit down with them my calves are burning now and my buzz wearing off. It's past 1145 at this point so i was def missing my ride home. Fuck. But i was in too deep to give up

The husband was chill. His voice was deep and hoarse and could prob do a mean screamin Jay Hawkins. They asked all about me, not bc i was any kinda threat but out of genuine curiosity. Lent me a smoke which i burned inside. Sat there for 2 hours till their guy picked up the phone and the husband walked me across the street while he went up to get what i came for. Two young runners stood outside the building yelling out to passersby and cars with open windows (we were in the projects at this point). My guy comes out and slips me bun while i throw him a 20. I had now thrown a good $100 at all the people who were trying to helpme that night. Took a cab home and was in bed by 4am. 

I know it's all a business and money can make you some friends, but pretty much all these people -- esp the old couple -- were generous as fuck and kind. Was an adventure I'll remember for a while

Coming from someone who has taken a few extra Oxys/hydros after a surgery on a few occasions and never really gotten into it I’d just like to hear about your first experience with heroin: what led you to take the drug in the first place, what it was like deciding to finally do it, who you were with/if others influenced you to partake, when did you begin to IV (if ever), etc. I’ve experimented with plenty of substances before and opiates were just never one of the ones I got into for whatever reason, so this isn’t coming from a judgmental perspective, simply from someone fascinated by the topic of drugs, addiction and opiates (heroin especially due to the particular stigmata associated with it) especially with all the attention they have gotten in the US media lately.

I have clonidine and gabapentin prescribed but I pissed through my one month supply in 25 days so i have one week left of 1800 mg a day, shitload of clonidine though but it's not helping the anxiety and rls. On the positive side I just got a crown put in my mouth that throbbing like a motherfucker bit the doctor told me I have a high pain tolerance so we'll see how this second appt goes he said he'll prescribe something for pain but I'm if it's norcos or ibuprofen 800; I take a gram of naproxen as well but I'm :) still throbbing. Sorry for the rant y'all I'm sober but tweaking if you feel me. 

Also if I say fuck it I can pull the granny trash patch kid and take the patch of my dad when they throw it away but that's a whole new low.

When I relapse, I generally go all in but manage to stop after a day or two. This time the Suboxone isn't helping my rls and I'm not sleeping well. Generally it helps 100% when I stuff back. I hate to admit but I havent been doing all that well on Suboxone and have relapsed, I believe, twice this year already and once at the end of last year. 

I'm wondering if the heroin is upping my tolerance and my normal dose is holding me. I don't think it is orwcipated because after I took it I didn't get more sick. 

My question is. Does this happen to you guys when you go back on Suboxone? Is there usually a couple crappy days before in feeling better or did I fuck up my tolerance even worse?

Now though, I have recently acquired a script of hydrocodone 10 mg for pain management of migraines.  I've been taking 10 mg every week or so for the actual pain, but have also been using around 10-15 mg's every 3-10 days (depending on my schedule).  

Of course I'm worried about getting addicted, but I've not really noticed any signs of addiction so far with my regiment.  The only real signal I've noticed is normally on the 4th or 5th day after not dosing, I may get a slight craving that's actually pretty easy to ignore if I want to.  So, for those more experienced, do some people just not get addicted as easily to opiates as others?  Am I just not giving it enough time (a week or so) between doses to actually notice withdrawal symptoms?  Or should I be good to stay on this schedule for the time being with little worry?  Thanks!

None of this information is relevant because you never know what people are going through internally, but this guy literally had the world in his hands. 

I don't want to seem like I'm all high and mighty or out for sympathy because truth be told i wasn't very close to him. I'm more or less worried about my personal friends who were close to him.  I guess I just feel the need to talk about it, because heroin has such a nasty image, but if you saw this guy you would NEVER know.  It hasn't come out yet whether the OD was an accident or if it was done intentionally. He just got out of rehab last Thursday and has been dealing with a serious break up so who knows.

I know this post is unstructured, I'm just blown away by the fact that this guy is gone.  My mom used to abuse pain medication; in high school I would stay with her on the weekends and I recall having to dig pills out of her mouth while she was asleep from the previous pills.

I did 40mg oxy a week ago if that makes any difference in tolerance whatsoever. Keep in mind that these doses are on the heavier side of what I can handle.

However,  if you are like me and just went on a one or two week bender and are about to experience a minor yet still VERY uncomortable withdrawal, i HIGHLY recommend exercising during it. Specifically running. It sucks. It's hard. It's  not fun but the duration of your physical withdrawal symptoms will be cut by 2-3 days in total and the dopamine will start flowing naturally sooner. Ive experienced many acute withdrawals ( 2-3 week benders. W/d are accompanied by aches and pains, RLS, chills and sweats, the shits, etc) and running a mile a day during the process has made the whole experience wayyy better and faster.

Over a year ago (14-15 months)  I quit opiates after having some success with pure bupe and my tolerance for opioids was getting too high for good pain relief. My plan was to get real low on  bupe then quit and switch to hydro or Oxy only as needed hoping my tolerance went back down. I was down to 2mgs a day but recently my back pulled on me again leaving me in bed for days. Can’t drive and struggling walking and getting around. 

My doc wanted me to try hydrocodone or oxy instead I said I’m willing to try it but he walked back in with only the hydro option this script to see how it does. However, it’s only 5mg hydros twice a day. How am I supposed to get pain relief whenever bupe lasts for days with that weak of a mg. Do you guys think maybe the doctor is testing me to make sure I can handle the hydro first correctly being someone he may consider being a risk since I was on bupe? 

If it has been like 15 months since I’ve had a full agonist opioid, will 10mg of hydro actually provide some pain relief once bupe goes through my system. How many days do you guys think it will take for hydro to work if I’ve only been doing like 2mg a day for a few months. I’m not really looking for a high so you guys know and more for pain relief first. I go back in 2 weeks to this doc and obviously I’m going to straight up ask for a higher mg unless 5mg twice a day actually helps. He also mentioned I think OxyContin. I thought they quit making that or is it a ER version now? Almost thinking about asking for a er pill then hydro or Oxy for breakthrough pain. Lmk what you guys think my tolerance should be like at this point, in your opinion. This morning was my last dose of subutex I had around 2mgs. Obviously I’ll try waiting 3-4 days to take one.

Then, one day, someone maybe your sister, your brother, your friend, or maybe even your parents hand you a new mask and say 'Hey, try this on.'

Reluctant at first, you finally grab the mask and fit it over your face. Suddenly your perception changes and you don't know what it is, but you instantly fall in love. ""Damn this is cool! I could get used to this."" But no mind is payed to the first time wearing the mask.

One morning down the line, you wake up, go to the mirror, and realize the mask is tied to your face with a couple rogue stitches. Jumping back startled, you rip the mask off leaving a couple small gashes on your face. This scares you and you shove the mask in your closet to collect dust. But, as time passes, you start to dust it off and within no time, you're wearing the mask.

Now you've been very casually wearing this mask around pretty consistently. One morning you wake up, look in the mirror and your stomach drops. Stitches on over half the mask are now embedded in your face. You panic, struggle to rip the mask off, and succeed, leaving your face pained and bloody.

Be that as it may, even after the scars on your face heal, you continue to wear the mask. Soon, day in and day out. Then one morning you wake up, look in the mirror, and you can't see your own face anymore. 

You struggle and try to rip that mask off you first encountered years ago, but to your surprise, there are no stitches holding the mask to your face. Stepping back and realizing with horror, that it become a part of you, far past the point of separation. Unable to recognize your own face.

So you sit huddled in a corner, wondering if it will ever end. Wondering when it all became so complicated.",1521661504.0

I've been an opiate addict for, well, awhile. Started off with Hydros and Oxycodone when I was 15, ended up on Heroin approximately two years ago, and recently I crossed that bridge so many of us cross, and started IVing. I was on a clean streak of about 8 months when I got out of jail for my first ever offense and met the love of my life. Her name also starts with an H. So H and I were a dream team, and my God it hurts so fucking bad to even think about her, after everything that's happened.

So H and I met at a place we both worked at about a year ago. We hit it off, I mean we just clicked. I've been through my share of relationships, I'm not a fool. It was destiny that we met. Before long we were infatuated with one another, and dating, and a few months later living together. H had a previous drug problem as well. We just got each other.. man the fucking tears I just can't stop.. we began using together about once a week last August. Things were going great for the first and I mean FIRST time in my life, we had plenty of money, a nice place to live, good jobs, everything. However I should have known, the wild dreams and omens, where I would wake up in night terrors calling out H's name, to find her next to me, to comfort me. I woke up after sleeping from work at 7 p.m on November 9th to the worst disaster of my life.. I tried to wake H up to pick up her kids and she wouldn't respond.. I tried so hard and she wouldn't wake up.. my poor baby. I can still see myself weeping as the paramedics arrived, trying so hard to revive her.. the futility of it all. We'd done a little bit of a 30 of some dope that I had saved and I'd gone to bed, when I woke up the pack was lying next to the bed, and my sweetheart was gone.. just gone. I still can't process it.

I drive by her old house almost every time I pick up, it kills me inside. I want to join her so bad but I don't. Perhaps for my father who is the only person alive that loves me, perhaps for this story to get shared on Reddit. I don't know anymore, she was my purpose.. I've considered posting this story multiple times. I just didn't know what to say. Heather Lou, if you can read this somehow, know that I love you, more than anything..

Moved to a different part of the country, no health insurance to go to the dr, don't know anyone etc, so I have to rely solely on kratom.

How should I ensure my bowels are clear around 11PM at a festival? I have no experience with taking a laxative, so I don't want something that is too variable and might have me shitting my brains out in the middle of a show, and leave me clogged up by nighttime.

Do any of you have experience or advice for plugging at festivals?
Is is possible in a portapotty, or should I head back and do it at camp?
Should I prepare the syringe and find a way to cap it, or should I prepare it right before I plug?

___
So, I can't keep MDMA down and therefore cannot have a full roll. It's been a few years of trying different methods, fighting it with everything I have, taking smaller doses, taking supplements like zofran, but I have come to terms with the fact that I cannot ingest it without vomiting the MDMA back up and cutting off roll at the come up. It sucks.

So I think plugging is my only option, save for maybe injecting it. But if that were even possible I think that would be too quick and prone to redosing, which I why I don't snort it. I tried plugging for my last roll 6 months ago, but it failed because I still had feces up  there I couldn't pass (due to my crappy diet and infrequent shitting habits, both of which I have since changed so maybe that will be all that it takes). So that absorbed the MDMA was ineffective.

I am going to Bonnaroo (shouts out!) and will try it again, now that I have a high fiber diet and shit at least once a day. But when I shit I still usually feel like I don't pass it all, so I am looking for a way to make sure it isn't an issue. It could just be a matter of eating a lot of fiber in the afternoon so that I am clear by 11PM. So if anyone has any experience with clearing out there bowels, which I don't really, and how that might work at a festival, please share!

And generally, do any of you have experience or advice for plugging at festivals? Will I have to walk back and do it at my campsite, or could a do it in a portapotty with one leg hiked up? Should I bring the syringe and Molly and mix it inside the center of the festival, or pre-prepare it and find a way to cap the hole?",1521650906.0

First given the lower dosage I take and the fact that I don't go through anything is it possible my withdrawal won't be that severe? Second the percocet doesn't ""back me up"" I go everyday, does that indicate that I might not have the diarrhea? And last I do have the DLPA to help with cravings, those I get a lot, I don't have a blood pressure problem, but I've read that coming off opiates can raise your pressure and that DLPA can also, I can't find just the DPA so I'm stuck with the DLPA. This is the only issue keeping me from stopping completely. How common is a raise in blood pressure with the DLPA? All together I have ativan, zofran (nausea and vomiting), b6, a multi vitamin, vitamin c, DLPA, prozac, seroquel  (which I've read your not supposed to mix with the DLPA so I might go a couple days without it) I'm going to be getting the L-tyrosine.

I looked around this sub a little and the general consensus seems to be that Tramadol sucks, but whatever, I have it and I’d like to try it. 

So with my relative lack of tolerance what would you recommend? Would 100mg do the trick do you think? I have some .5mg kpins to go along with it.

So my dboy is a fellow pill head like me who just helps me get 30s because we both like to do them but he's not a opiate dealer. He does have seriously dank live resin and the best bud around and usually always shrooms on deck so I go for that usually lol. Anyways I digress.

1:00 PM yesterday, I get a call on my day off from my dboy and he's basically in tears because he woke up to an eviction notice to the apartment he moved into about 7 months ago. The reason he had to move into that apartmemt is because both his parents sadly passed away within one month of eachother last year, leaving him to sell his childhood house. 

I tell him ima come over right away to kick it and just keep him company and help out start packing his apartment/set up his upcoming grow op. Get there between 1 30 and 2, walk in, and he's seriously bummed. But not to the point of giving up on life, just seriously bummed. We spent the next 7 to 8 hours bullshitting, trying to forget the news, smoking, and he went through a sprite bottle of lean and five 30s and a bar and a half to himself in that time. He was hurting bad so all I wanted to do was make sure I could just be a friend as he needed someone to vent to and also make sure he was safe.

At this point its around 10 PM, and I've been up for nearly 36 hours because I used meth and I hadn't in a long time and had dosed the day before. I wanted to start to head home so I agreed to help him with one last task of driving some marijuana clones to the grow op around 15 minutes from his house. But as you can probably imagine, the nods he was having at this point were heavy because of the lean oxy and Xanax and it slowed the process from 10pm till 12am start time. 

Oh also as we were driving his car to the grow spot, his car died. So he got evicted and his car died in the same day. Anyways, my point is it was a long ass motherfucking day, pretty sure dboy fell asleep on me while I'm waiting on him to show up for breakfast. Fucking oh well. 4 and a half 30s, gas money, gram of live resin, a quad of bud and 2 bars is definitely worth it ",1521629742.0

Reflecting on what I could have done. 

Now, I personally would like to share this story because I feel like no one else in the world understands. 

I have never done heroin, but do pills, but know nothing about heroin. My friend invited me to do heroin with him but I declined. I still went with him to pick it up and chill though. I was driving and he hops back in the car after seeing his dboy and holds up a bag of white crystals and says ""haha, China white motherfucker!"" BOOM. If I had known anything about heroin, I would have known it wasn't heroin and was in fact fentanyl. He doesn't want to wait until we got back to his house to bang it so he cooks it up in the car (stupid, I know, but we were in the middle of nowhere far from civilization). Before he shoots he jokes with me that if anything happens throw everything out and drive him to the hospital instead of calling 911 because we were so far out I'd get there faster (again, stupid). He shoots it and immediately has a reaction I have never seen from him or anyone. He moaned a bit and his head hit his chest. I laughed and was like ""haha come on buddy you a little fucked up?"" Then I hear it. The death gurgle. I say his name and then begin speeding and repeating his name louder and louder. I slapped him and hit him. I began sobbing. I felt for his pulse. Nothing. I go into autopilot and scream still while crying and speeding into town to the hospital. Literally as soon as I whip into the parking lot his head pops up and he starts screaming. He held himself and said ""that wasn't heroin"" over and over. He tried to get out of the car and fell on his face. I run over and put his head in my lap. I ask him what he wants me to do or what he wants to do and he just starts crying and sobers up and says ""no please don't go get them they'll label me a drug user for life it'll ruin me please"" so I get him back in the car and we head to his house (stupid) and he goes back to normal. So, turns out, what I had thrown out was a full prescription bottle of suboxone and that baggie of fent. He became angry and said I stole from him. I was to traumatized by what had just happen I couldn't understand his anger. I left and slammed the door. Later I text him and offered to pay to replace the suboxone. He came to my work (chill place) the next day to get the money and said after what happened he was getting sober again. We hugged and parted ways. I get off work and am in bed scrolling through Facebook when I see a post to his page, and RIP post. My heart fell out of my chest. He used that money for more fent. I feel responsible. I haven't gotten over it in almost the year that it's happened. He died alone in his basement. And I blame myself. If I had known more about drugs, if I had gotten him some kind of help, if my state sold narcan, fuck. ",1521602390.0

So i was visiting my parents in california for the summer and picked up what i thought was heroin (not the black tar stuff usually found in cali but the brown powder stuff you find around england, where i live.). i was smoking it off a foil alone when i start to have a lot of trouble breathing. i initially thought i was just nodding really hard but i could tell it was different from h because there was no euphoria, just straight to passing out.

i can barley breathe at this point and start hawking up really fat loogies. the loogies get bigger and bigger and start turning pink, and then to red until i realise that im coughing up straight blood.

my mom arrives home at this point and hears me coughing (apparantly, i actually dont remember anything after this), and according to her i was barley conscious, and mumbling incoherently, while coughing up a fuckton of blood.

ended up staying in the icu hooked up to an oxygen machine for the next few days, docs said if my mom found me ten min later i wouldve been a goner :/

The stash was around 200 A215 30s, 150 A214 15s and about 200 C230 10s. When I bonded out of jail I immediately went to get my stash, took 4 30s and snorted another and went to see an attorney. I brought up the fact that these pills may exist to the attorney and he told me that the authorities were probably (obviously) watching my activity and that it would be very stupid if I had anything like that with me since I had been driven by a family member and would be putting them in risk. This being an extremely stressful and emotional time I panicked  at the thought of getting my family into trouble and flushed them all..... 

It has now been about 90 days that I've been mostly clean but with a prison sentence set to begin at the end of the month all I can think about is those fucking pills. All day I think about having them and almost every night I dream about finding them somewhere only to wake up sweaty realizing I actually don't have anything. And to make matters worse I moved to a new city with no connections after my arrest and have been too scared of getting caught trying to cold cop and getting a lot worse of a prison sentance so im stuck with nothing.

Immediately after doing one bag (I smoke it) I started to lose my vision and my hearing became extremely muffled. Everything in my line of sight sort of lightened out to whiteness and every sense I had was distorted it felt absolutely awful. It took about ten minutes but I slowly returned to somewhat normal and now I have a pounding headache with absolute fear about doing the rest of my stuff,

The supply of Oxy in my area has diminished quite a bit. About a month ago I found a connect who has Morphine 30s and 60s for a very solid price. 

Anyway, I’ve been plugging 120mg between morning and mid-afternoon and then a few additional smaller Mg plugs throughout the day, or another bigger Mg plug in the evening. Although the high doesn’t provide as much of a “euphoric rush” or uplifting feeling, I’ve grown to really enjoy. It’s very mellow and relaxing, more subtle but just as enjoyable for me. 

Not to mention lasts WAY longer, and the sickness comes way later for me. I can plug 120mg Morph at 10pm the night before and be good all day the next day until evening. Where as Oxy, if I sniffed 60mg at 10pm, I’d be feeling kinda shitty by noon the next day. Call me crazy, but for the price, duration of the high, and it keeping me well so much longer, I’m starting to enjoy Morphine almost as much, if not more than Oxycodone. 

(Please keep in mind I DO NOT use needles, and never will. Only plug my morph)

I love it. The thought that I have to be very sneaky and watch my back. It's always so great. Back when I used to do pills before I graduated to just snorting heroin at my desk, I would get my pills out, usually 2 or 3 oxys, sometimes vics if that's all I could find, to take orally and sometimes I'd take them out and I'd hear someone coming so I would push the pills behind the monitor where no one could see.

On multiple occasions, I forgot that I had placed the pills behind the computer, already being high, I just forgot I guess a couple times and would reach into my purse for more. Now, this was actually a blessing believe it or not... sounds more like a nightmare, I know.

But apparently the night clean up crew here are not junkies. Because on multiple Mondays (cleaning crew only comes Friday evenings) I would come into work in the morning and see, every so neatly placed on my drink coaster, whatever pills I left behind the monitor. I also would sometimes during the week, just happen to look behind the monitor, seeing the pills and being ecstatic because I forgot about them. 

Now; leaving those pills out taught me 2 things. 

1) BE MORE CAREFUL AND STOP PUTTING PILLS BEHIND YOUR MONITOR

and 2) no one here gives a shit what I actually do.... because one day someone was using my desk on a Monday morning after the cleaning crew had put my pills on my coaster... I came in and someone was at my desk. Surely she did not miss these two bright yellow vicodin. She welcomed me back from the weekend, and went back to her own seat without seeming strange or like she knew anything, but surely she had to have seen them, the coaster is about 5 inches from my computer mouse so when she looked to sit at my desk she has to have seen them right away and just, no one cares which is fine with me.

Eventually I had to quit because I thought I had a problem. Looking back my problem was I couldn't afford my habit, It was too expensive!😬 I also felt a lot of guilt because of the stigma from society about opiates. I've been clean for three years. I chip maybe three times a year. And yes I consider that being clean. Idgaf if judgmental people disagree. Anyways, I've been getting a strong itch to use and I finally gave in today (hence this long post, lol). Before I called my old dboy, I went on a mission to buy pins. It took about four hours to find a pharmacy that would sell me pins. So frustrating!!  My heart really goes out to people who are are using frequently and don't have access to clean needles. The way we treat ""the least of thee"" is atrocious. Boo Florida!! No needle exchange and no sell pharmacy needle policy is so backwards.

I know that's not a huge habit, but it's still a habit. I used to cop smaller amounts (3 pills) and let myself run out between scores, then the break between each score got smaller and smaller, then I started copping larger amounts (5 pills, then 10). Most recently, I blasted through about 20 pills in about 14 days. I decided that was more than I wanted to be doing, and decided to let myself detox and take some time before using again. I took 1mg subs the first day, 1/2 mg subs the next, and then only kratom and small doses of loperamide for four days. I'm on my seventh day of no oxy, and I have zero physical withdrawal symptoms, but it's like suddenly all this shit is going wrong in my life. My relationship is shitty, my friendships are deteriorating, and my lease is almost up. I honestly don't know if it's actually gotten worse, or if I was just ignoring how bad it was before because I could get high instead. None of them know I use. What's worse is a couple days ago I committed to my biggest score yet (25 pills) that'll be in tonight, because I was told that was my only option until early next week and I couldn't wait that long. Now I'm questioning the role oxy is playing in my problems, and I'm not sure if I need to commit to staying clean to work through the issues in my life, or if I can work through them while I use. I'm not even sure that I can commit to not using if I have that score at home. Plenty of times I've told myself ""not today"" but it never works; if I have pills, it's almost like I can't not take them. What should I do?

I’m taking 200mg modafinil every morning to subside the systems but by the time it wears off at night the sickness comes back stronger than ever and I start throwing up. Work is hard right now because I need to shit every 45 minutes.

Anyway, what’s a suitable amount of time to detox before you can consider to start over? Obviously 3 weeks of sobriety wasn’t enough. The weekend usage from there didn’t cause dependency, and I was completely healthy on the weekdays. It was the week long DHC binge that did it, but I wonder I detoxed for longer the addiction wouldn’t have come back so quick. Those 3 weeks lowered my tolerance to about half of what it was when I stopped, but after the binge it went way up to new heights.

86aoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/86aoul/a_preview_to_an_arduous_scenario_that_started_on/,14,https://redd.it/86aoul,sloan_fitch,A preview to an arduous scenario that started on a snowy morning,"It's 10AM on a weekday and I hear someone talking outside. Figured someone was shoveling with a friend until my phone chimed a message from Clifford.

&nbsp; 


Cliff's messages starting just after 9AM..

9:08 AM: Yo it's an emergency are you alive[.]

9:12 AM: I'm at your door and please answer dude[.]

9:15 AM: I see ur pops is home again 2day. I didn't call house or ring bell. I just want u to open up[.]

9:23 AM: I'm still by door plz open it. it aint nice out here.

9:36 AM: Can u open door. u gotta be up for work""[.]

9:46 AM: Are u alive man ?

&nbsp;

Next, my first response of the morning. Note, I was only cogniscent of the situation as of five minutes earlier. In fact, I didnt' realize he was outside my door sending messages for the entire hour prior to 10am until just. I didn't see the messages that were sent before 10AM until 16 hours later when I started writing this.

&nbsp;

**Me/Sloan, my first responses:**


10:13 AM: I'm sorry I passed out early had to be in work before 11am.


**BTW, it is around this time I first checked my front door surveillance camera to determine that Cliff was standing out there and confirmed that he was there for quite a few minutes prior. Just pacing in my driveway, standing on my doorstep, and periodically checking his phone.**

&nbsp;

Cliff goes on:


10:14 AM: I'm at ur door please answer. I been here 2 hours I know u didn't leave.



Me..
10:15 AM: I'll call you when I get there (work) what do u mean I didn't leave? 


Note, at this poing I'm just struggling to BS him that I'm not home but it's not wokring. I'm just flabbergasted that he's just been there and isn't going away. The night before I hung out at another friend's house. when I finally got home I didn't go to Cliff to hang out and talk. I didn't see the point because he wasn't doign me any favors, in fact he was a couple of days delayed in following through on getting subs..             


**But anyway** (yeah I know you're not supposed to start sentences with ""but""), before bed the night before I text real late and said ""I got work early tomorrow, I'm passing in a couple of minutes.""

Cliff asked me to pick up my phone, to talk for *just* 30 seocnds. I didn't answer. I figured he was gonna ask me to do something I didn't want to do. Then if I said no he would re-package the proposition since he couldn't take no for an answer.

Repackaging a proposition, how? You'll see in a moment. Basically whne I Say no, **he'll say anything** to get me to say yes. Sort of like that time last July when I had half a bun left and he had none. He texted me in that afternoon asking if  Ihad a bump, that he'd pay me back extra on monday... then I aske dabout he subs and he said he was checking. Then he said there was a good chance I could go pick the subs up, less likely that thgey'll get delivered.


That past time it was one of his imaginary friends with subs. Those imaginary friends used to prove indispensible to get me spending more.


&nbsp;

Anyway, Cliff didn't believe my lie when I said I was already on my way to work. 

Cliff continues:
10:16 AM: I'm at ur front door dude

10:19 AM Can u open door

&nbsp;

Me..
10:22 AM: What u mean I didn't leave yet? 
(still struggling to make him go away by convincing him I'm not home)



Cliff..
10:24 AM: Ur home. Can u answer door[?]


Me..
10:26 AM: I don't get why you're trying to get me to do sometihng this goddamn early. I want to be left alone this early.

(Honestly, it's a fucking cardinal rule not to ring my door bell or call me to physically do anything before 11AM with advaned notice and agreement)


10:26 AM: You wont even text me why


&nbsp;

Cliff goes on..

10:26 AM: Please just answer dude

10:27 AM: My phone is going to die !


(BTW my good pal Tim always used to use that one, when he was calling doctors to try to shop for blue he would tell the receptionsist that his phone was about to die so that they'd be more likely to answer his query or put a doctor on the phone. He did it a number of times when his phone was not low. I believe Cliff appleid this stratagy.)

&nbsp;

I, Sloan continues...

10:27 AM: Like maybe I wanna take a leaisurely shit.

(it is a crucial part of my mornign routine)

10:27 AM: And get back to you when I'm en route to work or something.

10:28 AM: And maybe I'm afraid to talk on the phone (last night) because I don't want to commit to anything early or by accident. (same applies now)


&nbsp;

Cliff, starts to give us some gold...

10:28 AM: I'm frozen just open plz


(oh, he's frozen.... I wonder who's idea it was to stand in my driveway for an entire fucking 90 minutes!)


10:35 AM: If u aint leauin open dooq plz

10:36 AM: U Cant anser door ? I'm so cold plz

(once again, who's fault is it that he's so cold?

&nbsp;

Then I elaborate why I ain't coming to th door because I fucking gave up on trying to convince him I'm not home; thus I go on to respond.


Me/Sloan....

10:48 AM: You're gonna sk me to do something before work, right? That's why you won't text me why you're waiting.

10:49 AM: No I wear. Just open.

&nbsp;


I tip-toed to my kitchen, walked past my front door and started making coffe. Spent a good ten minutes in my kitchen quietly preparing, watching my surveillance camera and drinking coffee.

&nbsp;

I just started Suboxone and I already relapsed, I stopped taking the medication for a few days so that I could use Vicodin.

I started up the Suboxone again but the cravings aren't going away. I am currently taking 8mg twice a day. I don't think suboxone is going to work for me and was thinking that in order to get past this I may have to be on methadone to combat the chemical addiction aspect.

The only problem is I don't know how to go about switching and think that it might be better to give the Suboxone a little more time or go back to my doctor and explain that 16mg a day isn't enough.

Based on the research I have done the methadone replacement therapy seems like a better fit for me personally since I would have some accountability since it requires that I go to the clinic/dr.office every day to get my medication. 

I have already found a private practice in NYC that is close to my intensive outpatient program and they take walk-ins. 

Does anyone know if methadone would help more with the obsessive cravings than suboxone? I feel that it would but I don't have any evidence to support that other than my lackluster experience with Suboxone thus far.",1521673323.0

The first time I got fentanyl was so scary. It was a tester bag my backup d-boy gave me with my normal pickup, he told me to let him know how the tester bag was. It was some stuff he had gotten off a new plug and he wanted to know how it was before he made the decision to buy an amount to sell or pass on it.
 My girlfriend was driving and I was in the passenger seat. I dumped out the bag on my phone and it resembled crystalesque brown sugar. Which is nothing like the stuff I normally get off my backup dboy which is your typical East Coast powder. I chopped it up and i snorted 2/3 of the bag and she snorted 1/3.
 Within five minutes I knew something was wrong... and another five minutes later everything hit me at once I was so high I thought I was overdosing. I couldn't feel myself breathe my ears were ringing I had tunnel vision I was super dizzy and my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was literally scared for my life and it's getting more and more intense every minute... All the while Im thinking we're going to crash because I assume that my girlfriend is as high as I am while driving...And then the next thing I know I was waking up in the passenger seat of my car parked in a parking lot with some guy knocking on the window and my girlfriend talking to him telling him everything is alright with me. Luckily it was some random fellow dopehead making sure we were okay and not a cop...luckily because she only did one third and I did two thirds it didn't hit her as hard as it did me, but after the whole ordeal she admitted to me that she was worried about her well-being during the episode as well. That was one of the scariest things thats ever happened to me. The shit was deff brown sugar and Fentanyl because the only thing I could taste was brown sugar no dope taste whatsoever.",1521672233.0

Like 3-4 hours ago to be more specific.  I decided I was gonna go cold cop from an area near where I used to live.  The first time I ever used I got it from a homeless guy in this area who asked to borrow my phone.  When I asked what he was getting, he told me and I said I wanted some.  

Anyways, not 3 minutes after getting off the highway into this area, I see a homeless guy with a sign, so I decide to stop and ask him if he know where I can get the hookup.  He told me he doesn't mess with it anymore but there are people around who do.  As we're talking a black dude drives past on the other side of the road.  ""Aye!"" He was tryna see if the homeless guy wanted to cop.  ""Hell yeah, this fast?"" , I thought as I whipped around.  I pull into the CVS the black guy did and ask if he can get any dope.  He had two other dudes in the whip with him.
""What's good bro.  You know where I can find some boy/down etc""
""Nah bro I got that hard""
""Ah fuck.  Can you get down?""
""You don't want none of this bruh?""
""Nah man, my parents were crack addicts when I was younger.  I know h isn't any better, but no reason to add another problem""
""Aight well much do you need?""
""A 40""
""Alright we'll pull over here to the side.  There's cameras and I don't like that shit""
Fair enough, I thought as I followed him past a couple different store fronts until we were on the side of a bank.  I get out and walk up to his window, leaving my car on and behind me.  He gives me his phone number and asks how long I'll wait.  As I'm saying I only have like half an hour until I gotta go, his friend in the back seat gets out of the car.  This didn't really strike me as odd, as much as it should have. 

""You wanna gimme the 40 and have me come back to u with it?""  
""Nah bro I don't let my money walk""  
While I'm still talking to the driver, dude from the backseat got into my car.  I didn't even notice until after he backed out of the parking spot and was already driving forward.  I sprinted full speed and managed to get my fingers wrapped around the door handle as he was driving.  I pull the door open and as soon as I'm looking at him in the face, he smiles and accelerates even more to where I can't do a thing but watch as my car drives away, guaranteeing my fucked situation.  

""Really!?  Did this really just fuckin happen?  FUCK!!! FUCK ME!  I wasn't even supposed to be on this side of town!  My parents are gonna fucking kill me!"" 

I turn around and the other car is gone already...  At this point I'm just super defeated and upset with my stupidity.  Not to mention worried about how my parents will react.  

So I call 911 and inform them my car was stolen.  They arrive, get my story, then are nice enough to Give me a ride down the road a bit to a place I know (after being searched and handcuffed but I didn't have anything on me so I didn't care).  The spot they drop me at is where I first copped dope (behind a bowling alley).  I call my dad and tell him the news.  

""Are you fucking kidding me!?  What are you doing out there anyways?  Visiting Ben?"" (Old friend I've gotten into a lotta trouble with.  Parents knew he was my weed dealer for a while, but he also served me xans and coke at times thru our friendship.  Never dope because he actually is a friend and felt bad)
""No dad, I was coming to meet up with a girl"" (lie but I wasn't there to see ben either and I'm not gonna say why I was there)
""And she coincidentally lives near one of the only places I don't want you to go?""
""Idk what to tell you dad.  I wasn't here to see Ben.""
""Well, your step mom will be there to pick you up.""

While waiting over at the bowling alley, I manage to buy one bag from somebody that looks the part.  They only had that one or I would've gotten more.  

My mom picks me up and we get home.  Almost right after, the cop calls and says we've found your car.  Can you come get it?  Uhhh, fuck yes!  The car was a g37 so it's a push to start.  I had the key still in my pocket when it was stolen, so as soon as he got out of the car or stopped it, he was fucked. He ended up locking himself out and leaving the car on the side of the road (while on I should  say)and as I type this my stepmom is driving me to go get it.  

It was a very shitty experience but I've learned a lot from it and nothing seriously bad happened.  Sorry if this story is kinda choppy and/or sloppy.  I'm on mobile.

So part of having to take a week off work my employer wanted me to take a drug test by today at 4pm.  I had five days to prepare. I have been weaning myself off opiates but could not have went cold turkey to use my own urine. 

A trusted friend of mine who lives across the country told me they had some synthetic urine and they would send it to me. It was supposed to arrive here today. I waited until 2pm and our mail never arrived. So I left to go find some of my own. I saw the mailman around the corner so hopped out and talked to them. They didn’t have my package unfortunately (but did have my roommates mail order Xanax, go figure). 

I ended up calling my mom, as she’s one of the few people left on my side. Told her I was chosen at work for a random drug test and I had just smoked marijuana last weekend and needed the funds for urine. She was cool with this and let me borrow money and use her microwave to heat it up in. I heated it up, attached the heating pad, threw it in my pants and went straight to the testing facilities. 

The woman that worked there was a no nonsense type woman.  I had to take off my jackets and that was it. She told me I had 4 minutes and not to flush. I poured the contents of my bottle into their cup. Noticed their cup read “temp=green” and took that as that little circle had to be green for them to accept it. After pouring my synthetic urine in there the circle was red. With maybe 3 minutes left I held my heating pad up to their cup and the circle went from red > green > blue FAST. I took the heating evidence leftover and put it in my pants, waited for that circle to turn green, and as soon as it did opened the door and handed it to the lady. She immediately looked at the temperature circle and accepted it. Signed my papers and walked out the door. 

I’m 98% certain I passed. Won’t find out until next week.  Now to move on to getting clean and cleaning up the rest of my life. I read all of your comments from the last post. Thank you for all the support and tough love. I needed it. 

I’ll probably post another update later this weekend or next week. Peace love & nods ya’ll.

Again, I ask because I have only seen tar on here. The consistency of it is dry, shiny, and with some heat tiny particles will stick to the baggy a TINY bit (miniscule) but then it dries back up and it comes right out of the bag, its rocky but crushed.

Hope ya'll are having a nice day, it would be cool if I could poop right now.

Morphine isn't that expensive too where i live, it's like 5€ for 100mg, plus any doctor are allowed to  prescribe you morphine as a substitution treatment for opiates like heroin so it's super easy to get...

Falling hard?,"So I've been using for about 2 1/2 years now, but have always stuck to one super bitch of a dgirl up until about November of last year. Then I was amazed to find a reliable, respectful guy with better prices AND higher quality ECP. He is extremely good looking and has a ripped bod to boot. (JACKPOT YAY ME)

Anyway, the usually all-but-certain question to be asked of any decent looking female junkie by a male dealer was asked of me. He wanted to know if I would ""spend some time'' with him for free product. Although this goes against every moral on that fucked up compass most of us have (or had, some time long ago), it didn't take long before I gave in. And to be fair, I would have wanted dat ass anyway ;)

I half expected the chivalry/respect to all but cease after that, but quite the opposite happened.. he is genuinely interested in my life and makes comments about various things showing that he actually cares about my future. For example, I just scored this amazing job I've wanted for years (graduated college 2 years ago), and he had a concerned talk with me about how I need to ""quit the shit"" ""because this is your future, [enter my name]"". Then last time we met up, he took me to his new office space that he and a friend are turning into a barber shop in the hip yet ghetto downtown area. He showed me the layout and when I tried to hand him the money for the dope, he put it back in my hand but threw me a g. I was shocked.

Later that night he even texted me the drawn out floor plans for the space he has rented for the business. I felt flattered that he wanted to show me something so important to him. So I guess my honest question is, is there any possibility this dboy is into me for more than sex or is he just a really really above average nice guy?? Bc truth be told, I'm starting to get those motherfuckin butterflies now whenever I see his name pop up on my phone and I know that is NOT normal!

Edit: I also would like to clarify I am highly doubtful I'm his only customer he's putting the moves on. I just feel like I'm seeing a different side to him than most would expect to see in this situation, like he's revealing more of himself and his personal life to me and vice versa. And I really do trust him on that level. I'm not expecting a marriage proposal or even a date proposal lol. It's just nice to have someone like him in my life, I guess.

And I usually don't do dope on Adderall, don't feel the urge. Before taking the Adderall I did 6 8mg dillies and did not get a single rush like I expected... My tolerance is MUCH higher now apparently because 8mg of dilly use to give me a godly rush man. Even 2mg I'd feel.. They were real Hydromorphone. It's the tolerance for sure. 

BUT....

This fuxking time I have been shooting like a point and a half to 2 points every 2 hours... I thought it'd last me at least 2 nights ya know... But once I get my hands on it I have a hard time not doing it till its gone.. Because my guess is this dope is fent not heroin what so ever. And my 1cc 100 unit syringe can't hold more than 2 points I think. Actually barely holds 2.. It's sooo dark when it's in the syringe I can't even tell when I register unless I got my flashlight shining on the syringe as I'm injecting. 

This was my last cop tho. I'm starting my formula to quit tomorrow. I hope it works, wish me the best.. 

I also got Super Mario Odyssey today but the Adderall kept me on runescape alllllllllll day and guess what.. I lost 15 MIL gambling in the game too... Was so upsetting.

I have been taking opiates on and off for over 10 years, started off with vicodin 5/500 years ago before the opiate crisis we have now. As of last month I was able to take them and still get a high, I of course have to take more than prescribed and my tolerance was about 100 mgs. I only took them maybe once a day and when I run out, im out, I never buy them off the street, im just out. This time I got my meds and took 70 mgs right off the bat. I had incredible energy but absolutely no high whatsoever. I have never taken suboxone or methadone or anything like that and no changes in medication since last month when I took them last and got a high. I did notice it seemed like it took more and the high just wasnt as good, like I was fighting for it. I have never taken more than 5 oxycontin er ( extended release but I break them down so they release right now ) and 5 oxycodone. I'm wondering if I need to wait longer than a month and go without or what could be causing this. In all the years of taking them this has never happened. It also has never given me the insane amount of energy. I just finished radiation for lung cancer and am always tired but the last two days I can't even explain the energy, like taking 5 adipex. Anyone have any ideas on what this could be? I like feeling the pain gone but that high just seems to remind me that the pills are working, crazy I know.  Any ideas would be great.

My question is, if I have some sort of back pain all day around would I be better off maybe trying an ER instead of IR? I thought they quit making OxyContin but someone here mentioned they still make it but I think only extended release. I have a few disc herniations, sciatica that runs down my leg and my s1 joint is to the point my hip doesn’t stay fully in place having to always go to the Chiropractor to stay in alignment. 

These hydros aren’t cutting it especially after coming off of bupe. They are barely keeping me out of withdrawal. Still have some rls pretty bad an I even got myself down to 2mg of bupe a day sometimes less. Is there any other type of ER med you guys recommend over an IR for pain? The only thing I don’t like about IR is sure you get a half decent buzz but a few hours later and my pain is back which ruins any sort of positive effects the opiate gave you. Do you think there’s any chance I could eventually work my way to an ER and IR for breakthrough pain? I hate to even mention the names of any painkiller to not see like a drug seeker. However, this was even my doctors opinion to quit the bupe without me bringing it up and he’s the most liberal type of doctor I’ve had, if you know what I mean. Should I just be straight up and be like how about roxicodone or is that pushing it? I just hate to keep paying my doctor for something that doesn’t work. It has been just over a year since I’ve had a full agonist opiate other than a couple 5mg hydro the last few days to try and make my withdrawal bareable. He says I can call in if they don’t work but I hate to see like a drug seeker and I thought maybe he’s testing me???

I want to be at the point I only need maybe 30-40 mg of oxycodone when in pain and get relief. Now that I’m older and been down the road of experimenting with H I really don’t find interest in chasing a high because Ik that will just lead me to running out of scripts early. I do not want to lose this doctor. Also is Dilaudid still given out or is it pretty rare? I remember a few years ago how well only 1-2 pills of those worked for pain (snorted btw) because oral for those is a no go. Do you think a doctor from Syria would possibly write for those if I brought it up or is oxycodone just as good for pain? I just want to find my perfect med and stick with it. I think it may hurt that I’m in my 20a btw. The doctor knows my pain is legit my father had to drive me to the doctors the other day because I pulled my back out again only from sweeping the garage floor and could barely get around. He could tell i was in some pain. Any recommendations for pain like this would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",1521764770.0

Perfect!!! i manage to get me 2 bags for free + 200 mgs morphine and some benzos without stealing whatsoever from my sis. 

Then we spend the day together, and i wanted to smoke weed, but i got no money : i meet a girl i've helped quite a bit and she invites me to smoke a joint and gives me some weed. Niiiice. 

Her weed was pretty strong thus i was almost too stoned and i was like""hmmm....a bag would be nice right now"".

....guess what? i meet a friend who already gave me a bag for free on sunday who gives me another today!!!(ok i've hosted him for a few months without asking for rent(he was generous enough), but still...

--
Hi r/opiates, 

After I stopped using everyday a few years ago, I have been using heroin every now and then. I have done mostly painkillers, and have tried heroin maybe a handful of times my entire life. 

Two weeks ago, I picked some up for the first time after I moved cities. I bought a bun, paid $100, and after he left I realized the powder is completely white (I have only seen tan/brown ones). I did some research here and decided to be very, very careful as it had higher chance of being pent and I haven't used since last April.

I tried it for the first time last Thursday (9 days ago), sniffed starting from a rice sized bump into lines. I went through one stamp that night, feeling the euphoric rush at times as I did longer/bigger lines. But it seemed to last very short amount of time, maybe 10 minutes? 
It was also the first time I couldn't sleep after, and I had trouble falling asleep a few days after too. I just felt like complete shit after that night for days and ended up fainting two days after.

And last night I did it again (after a week), had a great time. Finished 1.5 stamps and were able to sleep after this time. 
But this morning, I woke up feeling sick, threw up, almost fainted, and feel a bit like a zombie. I cannot seem to be able to process anything in my brain. But the weirdest thing is though, I just noticed that I have crazy pinned pupils right now... I've never had pinned pupils that lasted 13-14 hours!! 

I honestly have never felt like this way after a night of using, but I am not sure if that is because I haven't for a while.. So I wanted to ask you guys, has any of these symptoms happen to you or did I just pick up something that is not heroin at all??



TLDR - White dope only providing very short duration of euphoric feeling (~10min) seems to be creating symptoms: difficulty sleeping for days after use, nausea the morning after, pinned pupil lasting 14 hours, unable to process things, and fainting. Anyone else have experience any of these symptoms before?",1521916627.0

Since then I've tried 4 different bags from the same guy and no matter how many I snort I never even come close to a nod or even the warm opiate blanket feeling. 



Is it better to do big lines or spread out the lines? Sniff strongly or just enough to coat my nasal passage? I shouldn't be tasting the drip 10 seconds after my line, correct? 


I did 17 bags yesterday and didn't feel anything. I'm scared of needles so I really don't want to go down that path. I get bundles for $30 which is the lowest price I've ever had from a dealer so I've been going to this guy for the past 3 months.",1521916334.0

A wife. To do wholesome, do-gooder stuff like teaching children to read and think critically and act ethically.

Now, I am so afraid of being gaslighted and hit and cheated on, that I have not had sex with anyone who knows my full name or my address in 15 years... I think I am physically incapable of trusting anyone enough to put my name on there lease with anyone else 

It's just not an option.

So... What to do? Opiates. Because literally everything else I had an interest in doing it involved a partner... A close male friend or a female significant other. But having my closest friends and my only real significant other all lie to me about the most important thing to me has left me hopeless...

I want to travel -- with someone.

I want to start a business -- with someone.

I want to watch films and analyze them -- with someone.

I want to learn new skills -- with someone.

And as soon as i get sober, I'm so miserable that any potential friend would have to pick me up and get me moving... But I'm too old for that now, new friends don't just see me on the street and see what's up with me just based on my presence.

So... What the fuck? Life just sucks I guess. I felt happy on methadone, but it was poison to my physical body. I can't hold a job because when I'm sober I just move slow and think slow. I still don't have the balls for suicide. I just don't, and that's really frustrating to know, to know that I'm just at the mercy of biological imperatives at all times -- of my need for other human beings to just be near them for psychological reasons, because isolation affects me biochemically, for sex, for opiates since my brain was always fucked and I always felt miserable without them, and, finally, that I can't commit suicide because I have the survival instinct that is so strong...

I just feel like a worthless idiot. I should have been making better people than myself by now.",1521916268.0

> The people throwing needles out their car window (or throwing them as they walk by) don't do it because they don't have a needle exchange available. They are hiding what they are doing, so they want to get rid of the evidence. When they are high, the last thing on their minds is, ""hmm I wonder where I can responsibly exchange my needles?""

I'm not that negative.   I think users would prefer options.   I know most or all of you don't want little kids handling discarded needles.   What would help you?

- Avoid the younger generation. They usually only slang weed but will say they have dope etc. and will ask you to hand over the money

- Don't hand over the money to them

- Don't hand over money to anyone for that matter without seeing product first

- Avoid cold copping from big groups at night 

- Never leave your car unattended 

- I prefer cold copping during the day but that is just some personal preference. I can see the blocks that are systematically being operated. Dboys will be on their stoops and look outs will be on street corners

(Journalist Inquiry),"Hi everyone. I’m a journalist who covers opioid stories for VICE News on HBO. This sub is a valued resource for me. I spend quite a bit of time on here looking for what’s not being covered by mainstream publications (and the answer is a lot). One thing that has jumped out at me, particularly when reading the fent warnings, is how the ubiquity of fentanyl has changed attitudes and behaviors for people who use.

I’m working on a segment focused in NYC and, based on my own reporting and insight from this sub, I’m struck by the way many (if not most) people take it as a given that their bags contain fentanyl. What’s also interesting is how attitudes to this new reality vary. Some seem to proceed more or less business as usual, despite the rise in ODs. But I’m also seeing more prevention strategies employed, like on-the-ready narcan, test doses, using with a buddy, etc. And I see more people trying to quit or get on MAT rather than take further risks with a bad batch.

So I’d like to put the question to this community - how have you adapted to the new normal? Has fentanyl’s rise changed how you use? I am working on a video piece, but I’d appreciate any insight even if off-the-record/background. And feel free to send me a note at seth.dalton@vice.com.",1521897876.0

What amount of Oxy in Mg would you all consider to be a small/medium/large/insane tolerance?

Right now, I can quite easily consume 100Mg~ daily without giving it much thought at all. Am I wasting my Oxy? 

For instance, last month I didn’t take any Oxy. This month, the last two weeks, I have consumed 56 40mg tabs and now onto my second pack. Is this wasteful? 

I’m just trying to gauge if I should slow things down a lil bit to get the most out of my product. I don’t have any issues with stock potentially running out. Nor will I loose my house/car/set of bagpipes to outstanding depts.

Just want to respect Oxy as I am aware it is a very precious and sought after commodity.

FYI, I am familiar with Oxy and pharmaceutical opiates/oids In general. Have indulged in varying degrees for many years so am aware of the potential pitfalls/benefits and am comfortable with my own limits/aware of my own body.

My first experience with them, I had tried to crush the little spheres inside and it simply didn't work. They don't crush insofar as they *smush*and just turn into a flat sheet of plastic/matrix shit.

When I ended up snorting it, it plastisized the inside of my nose and didn't drip **at all** and hours after I snorted it I was snorking plastic shit out of my nose.

I'll add that I didn't get much of a buzz for the amount I snorted.

Fast-forward to now. I took 2, 18 mg capsules and emptied the contents onto a small aluminum billet (2x3.5 inches) as it has a small 3mm lip so stuff doesn't spill out. Turns out this was a good idea.

I put the powder on the billet and put it in a toaster oven @ 350 degrees. Within a few minutes it didn't turn brown or anything, rather it melted exactly like wax would. It turns utterly clear like wax.

I didn't let it boil, instead I removed the billet with tongs and set it in the freezer on a slab of ice/frost. It immediately solidified **exactly** like wax would going from utterly clear to opaque in seconds. Once it was solidified it had features of very hard wax insofar as you could scrape it with your fingernail and remove bits easily with your nail but I was at a loss as to how this current form would be used intra-nasally. 

I reheated the waxy stuff and added a pinch of baking soda and mixed it up slightly and re-heated it once again.

About a minute later it had re-liquified but was more opaque when liquified vs being crystal clear before.

Again I set it in the freezer and it solidified but was whiter from the  baking soda this time.

Now when you scrape it with a knife, it actually scrapes up [powder.](https://imgur.com/a/czyBb)
I insufflated about half of the material and waited. The baking soda burned a little bit but on a positive note my nose ran like hell just like when I oven-method oxycontin OP's and snort them.

25 mins later I'm happily buzzed so I feel that although I wouldn't say I *defeated* the time release matrix (I didn't destroy it per se) I did, however, change it's form to something that my nose can use. I'm not snorking back chunks of anything whatsoever. Just liquid at this point which is a super plus in the pro column.

My nose *does* feel congested though although it might just be from the irritation from the baking soda. I'll update this post it I end up snorking back a massive blob of plastic or something.

So, yeah. Pretty nifty. :)

**UPDATE** - It *definitely* works better than trying to snort the Xtampza spheres in stock form. I'm absolutely as high as I expected to be on 20mg of oxy.

*Interesting note for chem nerds* - XTampza is Oxycodone proper. Not Oxycodone HCL. It's my understanding that this reason ties into why all Xtampza capsules are slightly less milligrams than their Oxycodone HCL counterparts. Meaning the 20mg equivalent is 18mg, the 10mg oxy equivalent is 9mg and the 40mg equivalent is 36mg.

I'm purely speculating but is it safe to assume that mixing with stomach acid or some other first pass metabolism action is what converts to the HCL version? Food for thought.

I've been taking 5-10 mg Oxy, no more, every day/ every other day for almost 9 years now. I've taken a few 3 week breaks, and I take week long breaks every now and then, but otherwise pretty consistently. 
This little amount of oxy is enough to make my day good. On the bad days it helps makes things bearable, and on the good days it makes life feel content and happy. I'm not getting super high secretly and it’s not impacting my work or relationships, but I am self-medicating (with a very low dose)
I don't feel like I'm negatively addicted, in the sense that it doesn't affect my life in really any other way than give me a small boost of happiness that improves my mood, motivation and overall happiness. Almost like a longer lasting cup of coffee. 
I'm writing this here because I haven't talked to anyone in my life about this. I'd like to get some outside perspective. 
I know some people would label this as 'high-functioning addict' but I truly don't think I fit into this category. I don't ever take more than prescribed to me, struggle to control my dosage, or abuse drugs otherwise. 
The little amount I use everyday is mentally therapeutic, and at such a low dose, is it really abuse?
I feel as though I use it medicinally. It mentally supports me and gives me a little push, to enable me to find the happiness in myself on the days where I can't.

Cliff probably thinks I'm committing some kind of betrayal by not wanting to help him buy dope. He may only suspect that I've taken my business elsewhere but it is evident to him that his days of getting my money are rapidly coming to an end. Just as last week, he owed me half a bun and was willing to credit me another full bun. I declined because I did not want to owe him anything a week later. Even if I were to just owe him a single bun, I know he wouldn't let me buy one bun for him and call it a day. Hell, I didn't owe him anything and he still came knocking.


&nbsp;

So last week as far as Cliff was concerned, that was my last hurrah. I even used that phrase in a sentence and it appeared to have landed on his deaf ears since he didn't acknowledge the statement. Nonetheless, I've said it a dozen different ways and he knew damn well that I wasn't buying dope with him this week. I had my reasons, some relating to certifications and career. Of course I have other rasons, but by screwing me over Cliff fucked with my money for certifications as well my own happiness.


&nbsp;


As stated in the [first part of this particular tale](https://redd.it/86aoul) in the greater Cliff saga, it all started on snowy morning. As evidenced by my front door surveillance camera, he loitered at my door for nearly two hours. For the first hour I was simply asleep. Then upon hearing a text message chime, I checked my phone and it was Cliff asking me to come to my door. I tried to pretend that I was not home, that I was at work.


I knew his emergency was simply that he wanted ask me to do something before I left for work. I thought he wanted me to physically do something like pick up his mom's script but it wasn't script day. Before I bothered to come to my door I texted ""ovbiously you want me to do somethig that I don't want to do before work."" Cliff denied and tried assuring me that this was not the case. 


&nbsp;

He kept texting and asking me to open my door. That it was cold outside. I still can't believe he used that statement, I didn't tell him to come to my house in the snow before I woke up. Eventually I let him in after my first cup off coffee.


I was clear that I did not appreciate his presence but I heard him out. He asked if I was buying dope this week. I told him and confirmed that nothing has changed since last week. That I was not planning on buying dope this week. He then tried convincing me saying ""just one last hurrah, please."" As I ate my breakfast I told him that his presence was giving me indigestion, that I didn't want to do it but after his annoying persistence I told him I would seriously consider it. Just to go and leave. That I would drop my debit card off on my way to work.

&nbsp;

Cliff confirmed that he placed hte order and I started having second thoughts. I didn't like how bugged me in the morning before work to get me to do something I didn't want to do. I told him that he should cancel the order, that he would cancel the order if he respected my wishes.


Cliff whinedd in text, ""Dude, don't do this to me please"", ""I have them already coming with order for 1pm.""

I was willing to just let this go, but had I known what plan Cliff had in store for me this would've gone differently. For some stupid reason I trsued that this would go just as it has in the past. As long as I Was clear in the begining of what I expected and wanted, nothing would go drastically wrong.

I was dead wrong. It is my own damn fault for allowing myself to be put into a position to be taken advantage of. This proved to be on the of the most blatant violations of my trust.


&nbsp;

The other caveat, since I had to leave for work (and secretly to see Tim for dope before work), I had to hand Cliff my debit card to take out an agreed upon amount. $200, he'd get 3 buns, 2 for him and 1 for me. Then come Tuesday he would pay me back. He assured me that he'll give me money on Tuesday but I know he wont have money because he has to sell the pills he's getting.


So in all liklihood he's not paying me back in cash but in pills. There's also a possibility that he won't pay me back in full. Which is good in away because I'll just tell Cliff that I'm not fixing the power cord for the MacBook I sold him. It would've kept working if he didn't do such a shitty job of taking care of his shit.


BTW I just spoke to him and he said that he's selling the pills right after he gets the script. So sure enough, he won't have the money right away because it'll take a while. I'm formulating some ideas.

&nbsp;

Speaking of the MacBook, he rarely pays his debts in full. I basically sold him an old MacBook for $200 or three buns of dope. After he gave me the first two buns of dope, I thought I'd never get the third one. Then his power cord malfunctioned because I provided a faulty one in case he didn't pay me back in full. Then suddenly Cliff cared about paying me third bun if I managed to fix the broken power cord.


After a few weeks he broke wore the repaired power cord, destroyed my special structural modifications through his carelessness. In recent weeks he wants it fixed and he keeps bragging that he paid the cost in full.


The one time Cliff paid his debt for something, he milks the bragging rights. It's quite hilarious, annoying and pathetic. 


&nbsp;

Bottom line. Cliff waited outside my door for nearly two hours in the snow. When I finally let him in he wouldn't leave until I vouched some kind of commitment. I only did it because he promised me that I'd get my money back on Tuesday even tohugh he probably was just saying whatever I wanted to hear. There was some truth to it but I know if I count on money this Tuesday I'll just be met with waiting. So it's best that I take my payment in script form and as soon as it's available. From there I can use, trade or flip it for cash.


If Cliff asks me to go to the ATM with his ATM crd during the week I might also take my money back that way but I'd imagine that Cliff wold come knocking on my door once he reailized it. If he was willing to persistently wait on a cold day when nothing was owed, just imagine how he would act if he felt like he was owed something.

&nbsp;


To this point, I only spoke about the $200 that he was authorized to take from the ATM toward dope. Two minutes after that transaction another $100 was taken out. I noticed it, texted him and he denied having an idea. I thought I mis-read it then I checked my bank records at work and realized it did happen.


Upon calling Cliff on the phone he denied it, I checked the details and told him that it did happen. I said, ""you are the last person to use my debit card, just tell me now if you accidentally took the extra money out or sometihng."" He had it last, it stands to be reasoned that nobody else took the $100. 


&nbsp;

Since Cliff denied that he was the one who performed the extra $100 transaction, I said ""this is bullshit and it's impossible for me to find out..."" I then asked Cliff to explain his solution, he suggested that the gas station could check the surveillance video and show it to me. I immediately called bullshit, the gas station has no obligation to show me footage. That just made no sense.


Then I texted Cliff and told him I spoke to the Gas Station corporate hotline and lied. I said that they told me ""a police report is required in order to pull surveillance footage."" I told Cliff that I would be going to the precinct to submit a police report after work. This of course helpted changed Cliff's tune.

&nbsp;

Then Cliff tried to blame his middle, Derrick, for taking it. So he said that Derrick was out shoveling snow for money and that he'd come by in alittle bit.


Cliff said he wanted to look into Derrick's eyes to see if he was lying on the phone about not taking my money.
Around 7PM Cliff claims he spoke to Derrick. That Derrick claimed he misintepreted Cliff's words. 


&nbsp;


When I got off work I spoke to Cliff and the shit he told me on the phone while at work evolved a bit. You see, he claims that him and Derrick went to the ATM together and that he left my card in the machine. Since Derrick thought Cliff wanted to spend $300, not $200, he took it upon himself to take out $100 more. Now, Cliff did nonly get 3 buns total as far as he told me... so he claimed Derrick didn't say it at the time but that when reminded he would be bringing the rest of the order of dope later that night.


Cliff promised me that he would make this right. That if Derrick didn't take care of it that night he would go to Derrick's house in the morning. Around 3AM I spoke to Derrick on the phone and confirmed that he was not in fact dropping anytihng off to Cliff.


&nbsp;

Sure enough, the next day Cliff said that Derrick was picking up an order now and would deliver it before I had to leave for work at 2pm. I really had work at 3pm which gained me an extra hour when the delivery didn't show up.



""I'm hoping by the time you get here I'll be able to hand u what is owed. I'm getting update now I HATE dboys."" Cliff never used the term dboy until I started using it and I got it from this subreddit. Before work he also said ""Derrick just called me he's on his way to go pick up.""

&nbsp;

When I told him I'm departing soon he said ""I need ur help come quicker"", I said no because I'm not gonna rush through my shower. I'm not dirty like him. Well, I didn't say the last part but seriously why would and why should I rush for someone who already fucked me over?



Subsequently he said he took care of it and that we're now good. So I go, oh ""dd the eagle land?"" 

Cliff sates, first, ""nah not yet I'll explain later"". Then after I'm at work, ""I'm just waitin for drop off, he got it"", in response to a request for a status update.

This was around 4pm. 

&nbsp;

Around 5pm I ask, ""so he's got it but stll not back"". Cliff confirms, ""Correct, I'm epxecting him very soon."" Closer to 6 I rant that it's still not there and he says again, ""he's en route to me.""


Around 7 I say, ""is he on the way back from China?"" Cliff responds, ""No he's with his scrap metal boss dirvin back probably trinhg to ake bread. By the time you get out of work I'll have ur shit.""



&nbsp;

Upon another grumpy status update Cliff says ""I'm literally waiting now dude."" Just continued assurances it'll be here by the time I get ot of work and confirmatio of when I leave work. 



90 minutes later I get an ETA of 30 minutes. More ocmplaints from me and Cliff says, ""I'm literally sittin here waitin. I'm going to take a walk jsut to see."" Bullshit, Cliff doesn't walk unless it's a sure thing.


&nbsp;


Finally he stops responding to my messages after work. My worst nightmares come true as a result of my coerced choice to help him out. I texted that I knew he's lying but that I don't care as long as I get my money back.


Cliff didn't acknowledge that he's a lying scumbag but he did say he was sleeping.


Via text, I just confirmed when he gets his script on Tuesday that I'm getting pills or or money. He says he's going to sell the pills instantly but I doubt it. I'm not going to not take pills when he has them and wait a day or two for money that never shows up. If Cliff has a choice of selling pills and ordering dinner or paying his debt.. his fat ass will order dinner.


&nbsp;

So maybe I'll use the pills, maybe I'll flip them but I'm more likely to get pills as opposed to cold hard cash. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get some cash but I doubt I'll get more than $40, the majority of the debt will be paid in pills because Cliff uses his script as currency.


&nbsp;

If I decline the pills on Tuesday and demand money, there is a higher likliehood that I'll receive neither. 


This Tuesday I am waking up early in preparation to pick up Cliff's script. It will be pre-arranged the night before. If it isn't or if he doesn't answer my phone on Tuesay, I will do what he did to me this past week. I shall go to his house early and wait at his door, blow up his phone, and knock.


Hell, I have the key to his house since I sometimes walk his dog in emergencies. I'll grant myself entry as a last resort..


&nbsp;

So hopfully on Monday, I pick up his script, get some pills and later that day get money. I tihnk I'll take the entire debt in pill form. If he succeeds in selling pills, I'll just trade back my pills for cash. If he doesn't, then at least I'll have something.


Regardless of what happens this Tuesday, Cliff can and will be told to eat a bag of dicks. I'm only being cordial now to ensure that I can recoup at least some of my loss this coming week. 


&nbsp;

**I'm sorry that this post is a big step backwards.** It's like I didn't learn or listen to any of my past lessons. I just didn't think Cliff had the audacity to engage in this type of heist. I might pretend to want the pills really badly so that Cliff thinks I'm sitll in the game but my goal is simple. To recoup as much of my loss as possible by any means possible.


I suspect part of the reason he did this was because he knew this would probably be the last time I'm buying/loaning him dope and the last time I'm letting him use my card. Since it's the last time, there would be no consequence in violating my trust.


&nbsp;

I don't know if he screwed me because he could, he knew he could take advantage of the situation for the sake of his own benefit. Maybe he did it for that reason and to spite me after having to wait outside my houes for two hours. I'm sure inside his head he somehow justified his own actions.

&nbsp;


Seriously, I vow to never do aynthing for Cliff again. Once I recoup a portion or the entirety of my loss this Tuesday, I'm gonna use this incident as an example and excuse if and when Cliff begs for my asssistance in the future.


If he asks me for a favor, ""hell no buddy, I don't want to get fucked over again like you did to me two weeks ago."" Maybe I'll say, ""I'm not doing this, I don't appreciate what you did last week."" When he denies, and he will deny wrongdoing, I'll say, ""I'm not arguing semantics."" He knows he's full of shit and doesn't need me to explain it and I'm not giong to expend energy arguing such a self evident thesis.

It’s literally like the waiting room in that Eminem music video, I think it was „The Real Slim Shady“ back then. Some dude is kicking up a major fuss because he got kicked out of detox for smoking K2 or some other synthetic cannabinoid shit. Keep in mind he was on 130 fucking mgs, was checked into detox for abusing benzos by the MDone doc, and will now be given the boot without tapering down. On 130 fucking milligrams of MDone and with a sizeable benzo habit, all over shitty Spice. The police are called to subdue him since he’s barred out on wonky Chinese Xan presses. Some lady is missing several teeth and is actually storing € bills into her bra as opposed to her wallet. There’s exactly one person in the entire waiting room who isn’t sweating profusely. An obviously withdrawing mother is seated with her kid which heartbreakingly asks „Are these people sick like you mommy?“. The receptionist is enlightening a new patient as to the intricacies of stool samples. Never a dull moment here.
Blatant shitpost, but I just thought I oughtta tell you guys how MDone works here in Germany. This is a very US-centric subreddit but in the past people were very interested about the dope game over here. Thank God for socialized Yuropeen healthcare, this shit might literally save my life. 50mg of MDone doesn’t get me high per se, but I feel that opiate-induced contentness you feel after the initial rush from your shot has worn off.

so, we all have moments when thoughts enter our minds that aren't entirely rational from a normal human beings pov. But I hope you understand my train of thought. 




I'm out of coke and money, but would like to substitute for speedballs. My roommate has some speed in the fridge and since I don't know where to come by meth (not really a thing where I live) to do a goofball, I thought I'd try to shoot a liiiiil bit of speed with my next dope shot. 




Any experiences? It's possible I just won't do it as I don't really like speed (anymore tbh lol) when snorted or ingested. But knowing it's there just got me thinking. 





I'd be interested in how long the speed high would last when iv'd, how bad coming down from it is and how the rush compares to coke. All in combination with heroin, mixed in the same shot. 




Hope everyone is well out there!



Edit: just checked the fridge and it's gone, damn it. :( He must've taken it with him to party. But that means it should be there again tomorrow. His gf doesn't like drugs and she's with him.

that takes just what you give it
 that’s the toll you pay to live it 
and when all you wanna do is quit it
you just take another hit and 
before you know it you’re broke 
and you didn’t even know 
cause you’re slow 
to react 
when you’re smacked 
you just laugh 
run out of gas 
and pass out after work 

But everything always hurts.

I was completely fucked up on bars yesterday and got in a huge fight with my family, so I said fuck it and headed to the part of town known to be drug hot spot. I literally was about to cop, like the guy had it and was about to sell it to me, but then I realized I lost my wallet at some point during my bartard day. Fuck me man, I was pissed at the time but today I’m shocked at how lucky I got. ",1521838795.0
