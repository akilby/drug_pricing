My husband has changed our insurance and part of our are planning includes life insurance,but before they can finalize it they need to ribs fhrcj up and take blood and urine tests. I've looked into it a little and it seems threse will include drug tests. I've been using BTH off and on for 9 months now. I've cheated urine tests before but since they are testing for more than just drugs I think getting clean for it is the only solution. My questions are
How long until I can pass a blood test?
If I use kratom to help with detox will that show up on the test?
As i understand there are two main categories or strains of kratom? Which one will benefit Mr more during detox?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Got a couple questions if anyone feels like helping me out.,"A couple days ago I made a post about getting clean due to necessity and lack of money. Unfortunately, I failed miserably, and pretty much only succeeded in terrorizing my body for several hours before scraping together the last of my money for enough dope to keep me well so long as I dose myself every 12 hours or so for the next day or two, something I'm capable of doing, but the looming threat of withdrawal is rearing its head again, and Im not really sure what to do. 

I really do want to get clean, but goddamn, that attempt was agony. Im not entirely sure if took my subs too soon and brought about the onset of precipitated WD or what, but good lord... I was tossing and turning and literally crying out in pain while the minutes crawled by like hours. 

It felt like the subs did absolutely nothing, so I don't know if they were expired? When I put them under my tongue, they dissolved, but they dissolved into a mouthful of brackish, grey sludge that I ended up spitting out after I did some research (holding the horrible crud in my mouth for like a half hour while I googled stuff), and it seemed that everyone who experienced this swallowed the spit and experienced horrible headaches and diarrhea... The thing is, Im still not sure if what I experienced was precipitated WD, or just regular WD and the subs did nothing because they were either expired, I took too little (I too about 4 mg to start out with, waited 3 hours took another 4, waiting another 3 hours and nothing at all happened except my WDs got worse). 

Does regular WD usually get to a point where you're crying in pain and tossing and turning in literal body agony? I've been fairly far along into regular WD maybe once or twice, but never gotten to that point, so Im not sure if what I was experiencing was regular WD or precipitated WD due to taking the subs too early (though, by all accounts, I had scored at least a 9 on the scale you're supposed to use in order to determine when you should dose subs). 

Anyway, this sucks... I have bills coming up in a week or two and some back rent that needs paying (thankfully not due to me using house funds for dope, but because some people who rent from me screwed me over with rent and bill money to the tune of several thousand dollars...) Unfortunately, that whole scenario puts me in a precarious position. I signed up for health care (medicaid) because I qualify, and I plan to go to a clinic to get some assistance with kicking, but until then, Im pretty sure Im just going to keep my current regiment (so long as I can afford it... Im selling some stuff I don't need, and hopefully it moves soon... anyone need a laptop or some music gear?)

At the very least, if I get into an emergency situation where I'm forced to WD, I have about 4 doses of Kratom, a half a valium, access to flexeril and gabapentin, a decent amount of loperamide (a bottle of immodium and a bottle of loperamide pills), and maybe 8 mg's of those subs that didn't seem to work (still not sure what's up with that saliva buildup... seems to happen to some people and not others.) I guess I could *try* to get by with the kratom first? I dunno... last time I tried that it didn't work either. It seems like my WDs are resistant to attenuation, which is kinda scary, not to mention that even when sober, benzos don't seem to do much for me unless I take a bunch and then I just black out for days, and I definitely don't have *that* much benzo, I don't think.

Anyway, thanks for (potentially) listening to my all too common plight and the support you guys have been unfailingly giving myself and others who need it. This subreddit is something of a godsend for discussing shit like this.

Lol","We’d been together since last May. Everyone said there was no way the relationship could survive us getting clean. We’d “broken up” nearly every day when we were on drugs, but she always wanted to be with me. This time was so different. I could tell something was wrong for like a day in advance but she avoided saying anything. Made me spend a whole night wondering wtf was going on then just drops this shit on me, also btw “it’s not me, it’s her” btw of course. 

This shit hit me fuckin hard. She really blindsided me m. I got clean for her. I was not happy about the idea but she insisted. I’m kind of fucked in terms of acquiring dope now, but I’m also worried.

God I’m really just so disappoint in myself. Feel like if I had been stronger in terms of like staying clean she would’ve been cleaner too and we wouldn’t have had the problems we did, but I know it couldn’t have happened any other way. It just really sucks to have to experience. I swear I have never had anyone else accuse me of some of the things she accused me of. She has borderline personality disorder and some other problems like that, I stuck with her every time something completely insane happened bc of that shit, then she just turns on a dime like this and dumps me like a bad haircut. She made me question whether I was actually a bad person at times, but I know now that that’s a typical thing for ppl who date borderline ppl. I have a using buddy who had an ex w bpd, super similar situation, it sucks how right he’s been about things. So predictable.

I can’t help but assume she hates me. She did this over text message. After 9 months of living together and about a month of not. The day after I finally get stable on subs. What the fuck. I feel like a saint for having avoided going where I could have today. Went and hung out with friend and did a lot of dabs. Talked about her/it a little but mostly forgot about it. I have to force myself to not give a fuck about my ride or die best friend 24/7 life partner. I thought we had something special. It’s all so stereotypical too. God damn.

Take for example, I met my guy through my friend’s mom. She’d get us all goodies once or twice a month from some guy with these terrible back problems - and trade him liquid THC for his ridiculously huge scripts because he “doesn’t like putting that shite into his body.” 

My friends mom told me and my buddies to go trade him some of the pens we got from our weed man. Afterward we exchange numbers with the pill man and now have scripts of these white 30mg and green 15mg oxy’s twice a month. (About 50 each we split with each other)  Sometimes we do have to pay, but mostly he’s more than happy with the weed. Only gripe about the guy is how much he talks about the most mundane shit - “Oh, my new bicycle seat is authentic leather” “Would you guys tell me what shade you think this paneling is?” and we have to sit through it for 2 hours before leaving. 

Anyway we always break her down as much as she wants too and she’s happy she doesn’t have to middle or pay for the THC to trade anymore.

So today while waiting for my DGirl to hit me back, I decided to grab a couple shots and some bars from my bro to hold me over. He had a good deal on the bars and he said they were dank ( pressed hulks ).

I meet up with him, I grabbed 9 and a shot of black for my girlfriend and I. We did our shots then each took A QUARTER. As it starts to kick in, I'm pleasantly surprised at how good they are. Naturally I decide to start cleaning out my vehicle in the parking lot. No big deal. I got all the trash picked out of the truck and put into a shopping bag. I then walked across the parking lot, behind a store and threw my trash bag away.

I get back to the vehicle and my wonderful girlfriend is chasing my two dogs around the parking lot, screaming their names. Doors open, people everywhere. This is a strip mall parking lot. There's probably two dozen stores, there was a lot of people. 

Ok, so I get in and drive to where she is. Our dogs jumped into someone else's car, we got the dogs out and got the fuck out of there. At this point I thought I better go buy narcan. Im not sure why, I wasn't in the danger zone. Regardless, we drive to my pharmacy. 

I go in, wait about 30 minutes, get called up, request narcan and they tell me that I need to go through a training thing and it may take 15 minutes. I'm like "" ok no big deal, should I just stick around or will it be a while until you're ready?"" They tell me take a seat as it won't be very long until they're ready to start the training thing. I wait 20 minutes, ask them what's up and they say that It should be ready in about 20 more minutes. Jesus Christ ok. I walk back out to the racecar. 

We started arguing violently. Not physical but shit was rough. We both xanax raged out now. I walk back in the hospital, still not ready, fuckit ok I'm going to take a other quarter and get stoned while I wait. I load the bowl when I get back, take a big ol rip, pass it to her, "" hey babe where's those bars at?"" "" I DONT KNOW. IVE NEVER SEEN THEM!""  I start looking around and can't find them. She's screaming... The trash bag..

I figured I just have thrown them away with my fuckin garbage hours prior. I drive back across town, fighting away with honey boo bear, and finally after what seems like an eternity in afternoon traffic I arrive. She glares and lights a cigarette as I get out to investigate. "" Fuckin dumbass,""..  I park in the exact same spot and re trace my steps to the dumpster. 

There's a fresh layer of garbage bags on top of my little Walgreens bag but it's there. I climb out of the dumpster and tare apart the little bag and HOT DAMN THERE THEY ARE! lucky me.. I get back, she's less than amused I found them but she's glad I didn't just throw away money. 

We drive back to the pharm, bickering and fighting the whole time. She gets her shit and acts like she's going to get out at the light. I wasn't stopping her. She changed her mind. The light turns green and we are off, a couplea kids in love. We get to the pharmacy and I light my cigarette, toss her the lighter along with her debit card that I had in my wallet. "" Think about your decision real hard and lock the doors if you leave."" . 

Right when I get inside our plug hits me ( and I'm assuming her) up saying she's ready. I look outside and it's raining now. I know I have a partner in crime for at least one more day. 20 minutes later I'm walking back out with two nasal sprays of sober juice. She's in the back yelling at the dogs, hospital security parked closely behind watching. I tell her to get the fuck in front and let's bounce. I wave at the dude and proceed.    

We go pick up and all is good on the home front. Not another peep. We are getting ready for a nice dinner and some shottys. Another day in the life if a dysfunctional junky relationship.

Little background I've been using for a long time and IV for several months now. I (for the most part) no what I'm doing. I live in a rural area just meaning no corner boys or different blocks to cop from, u just go to whoevers spot and well u know the drill.

With that out of the way let's get to my extremely fucked up day. I was lower than usual last night meaning I was not doing great this morning, ok, but not great. I get a call from a buddy in need (I middle man) which made me happy because it gave me what I need to grab.

My guy tells me he only has a little left until later today. So I tell him to hold that I'm omw and I'll be back later he says cool, up to this point normal day, business as usual.  So I have my buddy come get me and I take off to my dudes house and he stops answering. He finally responds and says come in 30 (normally pretty true to his timing). 30 mins rolls around I hit him up and he says come at 410 roughly another 25 mins after the original 30. I'm getting very sick at this point. 410 comes around and ...nothing. 

I finally hear from him at idk well after 5 and he tells me to come through. I get there and he grabs the shit goes to weigh it and his gf shows up. Dude argues with his gf a good 20 mins with me sitting tbere. She then leaves and I'm like cool. Well, now she fucking calls so I wait and wait wait. Hangs up on her comes in the kitchen with me and another dude shows up. This mother fucker serves him first and this starts texting back and forth with his gf until finally getting to me and sending me omw. This entire process was at lleast another hour from when I got there. 

So obviously I frantically rush home to get well bust the shit open and throw it in the soon start mixing it with the plunger on one only two very shitty rigs. During this process the tip of the plunger breaks in half. Well at least I have another rig. Pull it up Can. Not. Hit. To save my life because the rig is so bad. I leave to go to another friends to try and get another one and as I'm trying to swap from one to the other I spill at solid .25 shot almsot completely and then continue to not be able to hit. While I'm there I give her some of my stuff and head home to find a different one to try.

I get home and since I gave that chick some of my shit I let her keep the bag (my stuff is in chunks so it's not all powder and shit) so it's just sitting on my lap. Yup u guessed it. Hopped out in such a hurry to get well I forget it's on my lap and it goes into the snow .. I salvage what I can and quickly get it in a spoon. Finally, FINALLY I get what's left to hit. I got probably a point out of the half g I waited all day dope sick to buy.... FML",1516235854.0

I didn't notice it but I guess he's demeanor was degrading, about 20 or 30 minutes later he started making noises and his hands went all dinosaur and started convulsing, I told his girlfriend to keep him on his side in case he pukes but his shaking made that hard.

When he got over that he stood up, bug eyed and just started screaming like he was terrified. Dude fell over his table in his panic. We got him back on his bed and his girl was asking him whats his name and what's her name but he just kept saying, ""Aliens, did you see the aliens?"" While grabbing at her legs to the point she had to get away cause he was hurting her.

I felt bad, but after that I told her I had to dip and that I thought she should take him to the ER as she thought it was happening  because he was sick and that he hasn't taken any drugs.

I don't know if he's trying to get clean and this is a result of w/ds, since the dude eats like 25 3+ mg pressed bars a day and just got into snorting fent.

As the pharma bro gets my methadone ready I hear him talking to the other pharma tech saying something like make sure you always watch those 2 because you know their up to something when she goes off on her own into the cosmetics area(to shoplift) and just had a very judgemental way of saying that and I just didn't really like it.

About 30mg a day.. and when I do have sex, I can get it up but I just never feel like i'm in the mood, and we do end up fucking for HOURS because I cant finish.. which also isn't exactly a bad thing. 

I started taking Testosterone supplements and that seems to have helped a bit, my question is it safe to take a ""go go pill"" like you find at 711 and the gas station..

A) how messed up am I going to get, should I throw the box away like they said I should and sneak a few pills to try when I try back to my home?

B) what sort of effect should I be expecting? Am I going to be nodding and shit or is codeine way milder than that?

C) can I mix it with weed? Should I just wait till I get back home so I can smoke and take the pill?

D) just avoid the whole thing and let the opiate experience remain a mystery?

Was wondering if any of you had any recommendations/tips to the method I have come up with.,"I have been using opiates for nearly a decade, mostly heroin. This most recent run has been going for about 3 years. I am tired and I want to be done (or realistically a break). I, like many of you, just can't deal with the withdrawals. Subs and methadone are not an option for me right now, so I figure tapering is the best option. 



Heroin is obviously going to be difficult to dose and measure accurately. Thankfully, my source is extremely consistent so I have a pretty good feel for it. Originally IV was my prefered route of administeration. Over the last two weeks I have completely made the switch over to snorting it. My plan was to essentially stop using and once I start to feel withdrawal symptoms take just enough dope to make the withdrawals subside. Rinse and repeat over and over, using less and less dope each time.




Ultimately will power will be the key to success here. I think I am ready and I believe I can do it. I'd like to get my hands on some benzos, though I haven't had much luck finding any. I have a gram of solid dope to do this with (though like I mentioned I have pretty easy access to the stuff).

At first look I thought she was taking a nap since her plates were out of state she was parked.  I ended up walking my dog later and noticed nearly 1.5 hours later she was sitting in the exact same position.  I got very concerned and realized this person might have been using or potentially is just very tired.  I weighed the options of either checking on her myself or simply calling the police (she was parked in a non-public lot).  I didn't know what was going on but wanted to make sure she was safe.  I chose to knock on her window and she woke up and was clearly on something (based on my best guess it was an opiate of some kind maybe heroin) anyway...I explained to her she had been out for at least 2 hours and she was in shock.  She refused help or assistance and clearly wasn't there for any reason.  I went to get my dog to walk and within minutes she had taken off (probably concerned I'd be calling the police).  Anyway after I began to wonder if I did her a disservice by not calling the police.  Was she safe to drive at that point?  Would it have helped her get help?  Did she drive off thinking this was a close call but going to use again?  So my question to you as people who use...would you have rather someone call it in and maybe give you a better chance of taking care of yourself?  I didn't want to get anyone in trouble but I hate to think how I may have just let her go to learn the lesson another day and maybe next time she won't be so lucky or maybe someone will rob her/steal her car.  (keys were in it and it was running the whole time).  What do you want a bystander to do in this situation?  I will say the girl was very appreciative of me checking on her and making sure she was ok but was emphatic to not get additional help or assistance.  My guess is she still had drugs on her or who knows.  Just want to help in the best way I can.  I live in an area that is a major metro area that has a problem so seeing syringes on the ground isn't unheard of and I want to know what the best choice is the next time I come upon this situation.,1516228492.0

It's something I think about from time to time but thought I should let you know.,"About 3-4 years ago I was in and out of hospital with kidney trouble. In one week I had to go to A&E twice, both times leaving with a prescription for oxynorm 20mg. Shortly after I had surgery and was again prescribed oxnorm. 

Because I had taken so many opiates in and out of hospital in the preceding months the prescribed dose didn't adequately manage the pain I was in.

No problem, they didn't know that, I thought. I'll just take a little more until I'm no longer in pain. After only 2 days I was doubling my dose, a privilege I could afford due to having been written multiple scripts in such a short space of time. On the third day I decided fuck it, I've been through a lot. I might take 3 instead of 2 and just chill out and enjoy myself for a few days. Nothing major, just a little buzz. I've been through a lot. I deserve it. I'm not banging heroin, just and extra tablet recreationally and semi-medicinally.

Despite the obvious naivety of the above mindset, drug addiction and mental illness had always fascinated me ever since I was a small boy and listened to Dosed and The Zephyr Song on the RHCP's album, By the Way. I had seen every documentary; Black Tar Heroin, Cocaine Cowboys, The Town Addicted to Meth, Ben, High on Crack Street, Teenage Heroin Epidemic, dozens of episodes of Intervention etc. etc. 

This is how terrifyingly insidious opiates are. Despite all of this, I still thought I could just play with them for a bit, that the fact i was in a post op surgery bed meant that the rules didn't apply.

I was worried about dosage and withdrawals and wanted to know if 60mg would be dangerous. I was met with person after person telling me to fucking run and stop what I was doing immediately. Here's where the insidiousness of opiates reared it's head yet again; I was genuinely annoyed at you all for telling me. I wanted to be validated, 60mg for a few days/weeks will be fine just don't go any higher. A little buzz isn't the end of the world. 

Then what can only be described as a massive turning point in my life happened. I thought, these people know what they are talking about. Don't listen to opiates, they're cunts and lie to you. You know this and have heard people weeping through withdrawals on YouTube saying the same. 

These people are trying to help. Listen to them.

It was about 3am when I made the post. At 3:15 I collected all the blister packets of oxynorm from my bedside table, walked across the hall, knocked on my parents door and handed them to my mum as she wiped sleep from her eye. I instructed her to never, under any circumstances, give me more than the prescribed dose regardless of how much pain I was in or how I rationalised it to her. I then told her to flush the rest when I was healed. She did and I have only had opiates once since, while in hospital.

From time to time I think about that night. I have an EXTREMELY addictive personality. I had serious trouble regulating video games. Opitaes would have won the battle, easily. 

Thank you all so much for being honest with me that night. Were it not for this sub telling me not to I feel I could have very easily justified the third tablet to myself that night and I shudder to think where my life would have gone from there. 

I am in my second year of medical school and have a fulfilling social life and am relatively healthy.

Use this plant responsibly, you shouldnt be taking doses any higher than like 3.5g per dose and a max of 7g daily. The more kratom you take, the more antagonists you build up. Lower doses are MORE effective over time, and have far far far less side effects.

Just stop putting a bad name on this plant because your abusing it and taking enough that would hold off heroin wd’s.

(Sorry, Just ranting)","Just wanted to rant  cause upset at the moment. Sorry it's kind of long. Nothing special here, so dont have to read this but feel free. So over the past months to past year, I have dropped so much money for dope given to my dealer.  The past week alone, I used my own money and middled for 2 people, and spent a little under a grand. Before that, the habit was average 125 daily. (Worked a decent job a solid year before dabblin back into H, so had an okay amount of money in my savings).  

Anyways, when I was running low on money, my dealer was always like yeah Man I'll always take care of you if you come to me. Around Christmas time, I told him I was running low on funds and might have to hop off soon and quit. He said don't worry he'll take care of me, hit him up and he'll help me out. He said he needed rides daily and he'd throw me some tar for a ride or his exact words, ""Catch me in a good mood and i'll throw you something. No need to wait until you're sick', just hit me up"". With all the money I've spent, today I was really hurting so I hit him up. I asked him if he needed a ride anywhere, or will trade a tiny bit for suboxone (Only had 2 or 3, I can actually sell these for cash but the guy who wants them is sleeping) and he asked if i had anything else. I told him I had a weight set, GPS, Nintendo64 + 8 games, and Beats headphones ($280 brand new, it was opened but in mint condition still in box and rarely ever used, (don't listen to music anywhere besides in the car)). Anyways, he doesn't respond at all to any of those items. 

I know it's pointless and I shouldn't expect anything, but i told him I was really hurting to the point I would of sunk to a new low, and he couldn't even give me a dub let a lone a dime for all my stuff. (I posted something on Craiglist and had some interest but obviously some things take time to set up and I needed something tonight).  If he didn't want any of my stuff, could of let him hold onto it as collateral or he could of just said no but just ignores me. He did this last week too when I offered to trade an Ipad, then 2 hours later when I got money and texted him, he immediately responds and tells me to come. Really pisses me off how much money I've spent and all the shit he's talked about helping, but this 1 and only time I've asked for help, he denies it. And I've never ever asked for a front before. Everytime i've tried to come with some amount of money, or trade items of value or offer to buy something for him with a Credit card, but this time i couldn't. 

Again, sorry for the rant, i'm just pissed. How nice are your dealers? Would they front you, or help you out in anyway? Wish I could just drop him completely. I don't want to give him my business anymore... it's just you all know how withdrawals are, I don't want to go back but am scared if I get really sick I'll cave back in. Someone did offer to buy the subs tom, so I am not completely out of luck, I'm just still pissed, and more so dissapointed. 

Sorry for the rant, again I know he owes me nothing, no one here owes me anything, just wanted to see how yall relationships are with your dealer. ",1516356909.0

So my mother being the caring women she is, figures it would do me no harm to slip me a Hydrocodone here and there to help me manage the pain. Keep in mind my mother was a single parent already balls deep into her heroin addiction, being a fibromyalgia sufferer herself. Well we refrain from taking me to the doctor as her 3 month supply of Vikes and 3 month supply of Tramadols kept me humble. Of course
My mom favored heroin so when she would nod off, I would grab handfuls of pain pills, mostly self-medicating but trading the pills for weed as well. Fast forward a few years later, my mom isn’t fucking w D no more after being forced into rehab and shes no longer prescribed Vicodin but takes 50 mg’s of Tramadol 6 times a day. At that point in time, I’m aware of my dependence on pain pills but haven’t realized my addiction. I was lucky considering my mother had a pharmacy in her purse and I wasn’t pumping out hundreds of dollars to feed my addiction, all I would do was sneak into my moms purse while she was off at her NA meetings (oh the irony) and get my supply for the next day.
Well soon enough I wasn’t a child anymore and the fibro flares kept on just getting worse so my mom cut down to 3 tramadols a day so that I could have 3 a day, getting a month supply at a time now being that she was a recovering addict. 
I’m 19 now on the verge of moving out, aware of the fact that I’m most likely an addict already and I know depending on my mother for tramadols and/or pain relief isn’t going to last very long, I’m lucky if I have another year.  Nowadays I don’t even know if it’s the Fibromyalgia or Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia or just fucking withdrawals , but I need a drug with me at all times. I smoke pot daily but without pain pills, it just makes the pain worse. Whenever I run out of tramadols early and have to wait a week for the refill, my poor mother has to suffer but I’m off into the streets substituting opiates with anything I can get my hands on (MDMA, bars, klonopin, high doses of gabapentin) being that any opiate other than Heroin is rare to come by and I’ve seen my mother destroy herself with that addiction. (Keep in mind I’m one of those people that gets the heavenly recreational effects out of tramadol). 
I know it’s only a matter of time until I run out of safe ways to self medicate , physicians never believe me because they either think I’m doctor shopping or they don’t believe Fibromyalgia is a disease or blah blah blah. I’m very scared I’m on a path to self destruction but I honestly can’t see myself living comfortably and pain-free without pain killers.

This is a cry for help, prescription painkillers are a beautiful thing for chronic pain patients but the addiction is ugly and the insurance companies are constantly fucking us, forcing us to self medicate and turning us into fiends and “criminals”.

7rh2l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rh2l8/a_guide_to_audiobooks/,4,https://redd.it/7rh2l8,sloan_fitch,A Guide To Audiobooks,"Audiobooks are an underrated medium. Some people annoy me, I mention audiobooks to an in-law and they be like ""I don't do audiobooks."" Well, your loss. I don't think it hurts to read a real book/e-book but I got no time to sit down and read unless it's a book that I love. I could be pumping iron, doing pull-ups, running track, running in general, riding a bike, building shit, or cleaning while listening to an audio book.


Sure, we could watch TV or YouTube videos while we do things but then one is liable to encounter the tempatatio to stop and look at the TV or computer display.

&nbsp;


Firstly, I'd like to talk about how I ""discovered"" audiobooks. One day, early in my dope consuming career I was between refills and was feeling a bit ""bored"", not very motivated but definitely not in withdrawal. If I had not gotten drugs the following day, would I have been in WD? I honestly don't know but probably not. I was at the point where I craved but wasn't compelled by the biology of dope-sickness. At future points in time whne I was dope-sick, audiobooks proved to make the experience of lying awake a bit more tolerable.

&nbsp;

It was that quiet early March evening when I finally decided to look up the audio version of a book that I was interested in reading. You see, I was reasarching how sometihng worked in a TV based sci-fi universe and someone posted an answer on a forum to a question related to the topic that referenced a certain space opera.


So I mosied on over to YouTube and waddaya know, the book was there. Then there was the sequel, and that was on YouTube as well until I got to the half-way point in the book when it was suddenly removed for copyright reasons.

&nbsp;

So I could go to my favorite free download venue, or sign-up with a legit service. Not everyone knows how to or is comfortable dowloading things from the dark recesses of the net. That's fine, there are plenty of Audiobooks on YouTube and Audible. An audible account is pretty neat but it never hurts your wallet to check if the book you want is available on YouTube before you buy it.

&nbsp;


When signing up for an audible trial they typically offer a free book via an Audible ""credit"". Bear in mind that if you're signing up for the free book, you better cancel your subsription renewal after you redeem your free audiobook. That's the biggest complaint. Some folks sign up for the free trial, get billed for months and then realize they weren't taking advantage of it but wating money.

Even when that does happen, such people would at least accumulate a bunch of Audible credits so it's not a waste if they start looking for books that may interests them.

&nbsp;


In the base tier of service you get one ""credit"" per month. For a little bit more you can get two credits each month. Audible credits can be purchased in packs of three for a little over thirty bux. A credit allows you to buy almost any book whether it costs $5 or $40+. So it definitely pays off when gettin a book that costs more than $12.


Furthermore, Audible membrship also ensures that you can get books at a discounted rate if you decide to buy an audiobook via your credit card as opposed to using audible credits. Handy when you run out of audible credits for the month but don't want to buy three of them all at once.

&nbsp;


**Recap**

If you're feeling down, want to lay down but know you're not going to be able to sleep an audiobook might be right for you! You can get started by doing any one of the following:


* Find a book that interests you then see if the audiobook version exists on YouTube.


* Get an Audible account. They're always offering a freebie for newbs. Members get at least one credit good for one audiobook per month and discounted rates on most titles via a member's discount.


* Get the audibook by shadier means.



&nbsp;

**Warnings**

* Don't sign up with Audible if all you want is a free book and to never use it again. Otherwise, set a reminder on your phone to cancel the recurring payment.


* If you find a book that is part of a series that you end up liking on YouTube, be ready to buy the audiobook because chances are the sequel is not on YouTube if you end up really liking the book.


&nbsp;


**Audible Specific Tips**

* There is a setting in the mobile app which allows you to switch form standard quality to high quality. Obviously the HQ setting will cause audiobooks to use more memory but I would assume that higher quality is *better*.


* You can use your desktop/laptop based browser to download any audiobook that you've purchased in MP3 format so that you can transfer it to any friggin' device. 


* However, the app on iOS and Android provides a very streamlined experience. For example, if you pause a book and then open that book at a later time on the same or a different device it will offer to resume from where you left last left off.



&nbsp;

Bottom line, I discovered this made time pass when feeling a sense of malaise and discovered a specific literary universe that made life more bearable. After reading that book four times I started branching out into other books and frankly I don't think any of them are better than my first but I'm hoping I'll find something better eventually. That said, I've enjoyed the all of it nonetheless.


Perhaps for some of us this can be an alternative addiction. Audobooks, as stated earlier are also great way to enhance cycling, commuting, driving, working out, cleaning and many other activities.


BTW there are non-bootleg places to get free audiobooks but their libraries don't seem to have what I'm looking for. If this post doesn't get down-voted, I'll consider sharing such options in the future if I find any that are confirmed to be safe to visit.",1516351894.0

(shitpost?),"For some background I’m 19 and have been using IV heroin for over a year (not consecutively) and daily since early October 2017. I’ve used a variety of drugs to self medicate for depression since early 2016. Since going cold turkey a bit more than a week ago I’ve hardly had any cravings for the stuff. What gets to me is that opiates are by far my favourite class of drugs and yet the only serious cravings I get even when dopesick are for alcohol, which I can’t stand.

Essentially what the fuck is wrong with me? Why can I control myself pretty well with a drug that I really love and have been using consistently for a longer time and yet only have that addict drive for dirty alcohol?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad I’m having an ok time getting away from daily opiate use but I’m just baffled by the fact that I’m more driven to drink. I wouldn’t mind continuing to use opiates and benzos in moderation (key word) in the long term and set up a good system, I just really don’t want to become a drunk again. My alcoholic phase was my lowest point and I never want to repeat it.

I fucked up in the beginning but got my shit together, mainly cause I was sick of going to jail. I had about 16 months clean when I got of paper in November.  Did good for a little while . But I just kept obsessing about heroin. 

Then I finally caved. I picked up and convinced myself it's ok because I'm just going to smoke it, (I get tar only where I live, which is where gambling, weed, and even prostitution in the smaller county's is all legal) . After I did that I wasn't impressed , so I blamed it on the subs in my system, even though I knew that wasn't it. Picked up again but this time I shot it. Before I knew it I was back to everyday use. But this time it sucked . I was constantly throwing up while high. I had one connect who sucked ass.  I was always waiting forever to get shit. In the matter of a month I fucked up the money I had saved. I never felt good. 

Which got me thinking maybe I got some preconceived notions that when I first got hooked and went on a three year run , it was the best thing ever. But now that I look back at it, maybe 5 times in the 3 years of using heroin that I had an amazing rememberable night. The whole time I was clean I latched on to how great it was. When in reality it's good for about 30 seconds with the initial rush and that's it. It was so easy for me to walk away from this shit again. I used everyday in December. Then about 16 days ago I was like fuck this and haven't used since.

I guess what I'm getting at is anyone that's clean right now and fantasizing about opiates just remember they suck ass.  I'm glad I relapsed cause now I know I'm not missing shit. ",1516340587.0

Right now we’ve been staying in our truck, because our house burnt down in the Northern California fires. Idk if I can post that but whatever. We were renters so we didn’t have home insurance and everything just got fucked. We’ve been staying in the truck ever since. So we’re constantly driving. Before the fires, we were constantly driving a lot too to go and hustle or he would drive out of town for work but now it’s 24/7. 

My issue is, he’s constantly nodding off while driving! And it really irks me. I’ve always been that person who wouldn’t even get into a car if someone had a few beers I would’ve walked home instead. I had one cousin die in a drunk driving accident when she was 18 going to prom, and her brother my other cousin got into a drunk driving accident at 18 as well and he was in a coma for a very long time and now he’s severely handicap, so I was always scared of that happening to me. I know nodding off while driving isn’t the same as being drunk, but to me it’s just as bad. 

During our two year relationship he’s totaled one car, had 4 fender benders, 1 of those fender benders was about a week and a half ago and the front end of our truck is fucked but it’s still driveable. Thank god we have insurance because we’re in a rental car right now, and it’s way nicer and more comfortable living in this than the truck. Plus, the truck was driveable but kinda dangerous. 

I’m sure you’re thinking ‘well, why don’t you just drive then’ and trust me I try to drive. Problem with that is, my license got suspended a few months ago from overdue tickets and it’s going to cost over $1,000 to get that back. I could really give a shit about getting pulled over with a suspended license vs. putting all of us in danger( I say us because we also have our 11 month old blue nose pittbull named Luna) I would rather get in trouble anyday over nodding off at the wheel and wrecking. 

Honestly this is pretty much the only thing we fight about. We don’t even really fight about it. It’s more like me constantly yelling at him, asking if he’s okay to drive when I notice his eyes closing, but this goes on multiple multiple times a day and I’m getting really fuckin’ frustrated. What pisses me off even more is that he pretends like he’s not nodding off while driving! He’s constantly responding with dumb shit when I say ‘are you ok do I need to drive’ or my outbursts saying ‘watch out!’ He’ll respond with ‘I’m just really hot’ and then turn the air conditioner on when it’s raining and cold outside lol he claims to nod off when he gets too hot all the time. I know that I can do that too, but with him it’s just a cop out. He’s in denial or trying to prove something and he just looks hella dumb instead. 

There’s tons of other shit that he try’s to blame on why he’s nodding off or whatever but at the end of the day how bad is it gonna have to get for him to realize it’s not okay to drive like this? I hate being that girlfriend that’s always bitching but I feel like it’s different because it’s regarding my safety and his safety and our dog’s safety.

I posted this to /r/drugs but no one ever commented, so I thought I would post it over here and see if anyone could help!

This has been bugging me for a while and I'm not really sure what the cause is. I used to take kratom once a week or so around 2 years ago just to improve my mood on some days. For the first year I was doing this, I had no tolerance increases and took the same 6g dose as I always have, and the effects were always great.

At some point I stopped taking it for a while, something like 3 months. When I went back to kratom again afterward, the effects were diminished by at least 70%. Same batch, same dose, and with a huge break between use.

Now at first I thought this was a kratom issue, so I tried rotating some strains (which didn't seem to help). The reason I'm making this post though is because I just had my wisdom teeth extracted and was prescribed Vicodin, which isn't considered that strong but I still barely felt any euphoria from 10-15mg.

On a day where the pain hurt particularly bad I was able to get a few oxycodone from my parents that they had lying around. I ended up taking 25mg total of 5-325 oxycodone but still didn't get any euphoria or warmth, just kind of tired.

I used to get such strong effects from even 10mg oxy a couple of years ago, what gives? I am not a frequent opioid user in the slightest so it doesn't seem like traditional tolerance to me. The effects that I remember were a warm, lightheaded feeling that made me want to melt into the couch. It was pretty nice to feel effects like this even from something as benign as kratom.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated!",1516313470.0

Been on my daily subs tho and smoke small amounts of bud. I got arrested in September with a simple poss. And I got this special accelerated program for it. Basically do a 8 week iop and they expunge the charge. Well finished the iop last week and have my final court date next Thursday. 

The IOP went well passed all my urines with a couple frozen bottles of pee (just to pass for the weed in my system). That was my 7th or 8th iop and been to inpatient treatment 5 times. I've had multiple stints with sobriety but most of those were while I was on either subs or methadone. But I always go back out eventually. Here I am again probably a couple days from relapsing once again.

Most of my relapses happen in a similar fashion. I basically get some cravings and dwell on them for a bit and eventually say fuck it. Well I've been having cravings for dope and hard and the opportunity presented itself today. Ran into an old friend that I got high with 4-5 years ago. He just moved back to my area. We exchanged numbers and both knew the implication of this. 

Only thing really preventing me at this point is lack of money. But I have a stockpile of about 30 or so subs I could start selling to get high. Idk I don't want to go back out but feel like it's only a matter of time at this point. I have it all mapped out in my head it would be so easy. Hit up my friend, tell him I got subs for sale, sell the subs and cop the dope. It wouldn't take long a couple hours at most and I could be high.

Idk why I'm even posting this I guess to see if I can get enough support to stop myself. I don't want to go on another run. Shit sucks falling back into a habit. At the same time I really just want like a gram of dope and a gram of hard and get high as fuck for a day. Only time will tell I guess. Hope everyone is doing alright.

I've had a few blog style writings in the past that were pretty successful and a few days ago my AMA on being an addict and living in the crack motel made the front page. I've been journaling lately and I'd like some feedback. I'm curious if I should continue, if anyone would actually want to read it? Without further ado...



**Unknown date**
Today was a roller coaster. Woke up arguing with Sarah, my girl. I think… I can’t really remember but that’s how most mornings begin. Smooth called and it was payday so all bets were off. I got dressed and Smooth had his sister drive to the motel to pick me up to grab my paycheck. 



I got into the back of a decent car and there was a beautiful pit bull pup in the back seat with me. Smooths sister is a bit darker than him, sometimes I’m pretty sure slim is mixed. I walked into Got Burger and put on my mask. I had to work in 90 minutes and I’m grabbing $180, like I couldn’t wait. Thankfully the mask works and no one suspects anything deceitful.


I originally wanted a $60 of heroin and $20 of crack. The boss overpaid me by about $40 so I decided to get more. Unfortunately he only had $60 worth of heroin on him, some drug dealer. He offered a huge rock of crack if I spent an extra $20 so I went ahead and spent the $100 like a stupid addict. I had just told them I don’t even like more than $20 worth of crack and almost never buy more than that. Smooth insisted I “smoke the crack, man, don’t shoot it” and went on a long tangent about how I needed to start “loving life” and once again mentions when Brian shoved ice cubes down my pants. Finally he hands over the drugs.


We walked from my job a few blocks to his uncles, who also smokes crack. Since he was letting me use his pipe and house I told him I would smoke the rock with him. First things first though, I shoot the dope in his bathroom. Sarah’s Christmas present to me was a beautiful red hoodie with built in headphones for draw strings and I use these as a turniquette. This makes me feel guilty. The dope is surprisingly good for smooth who usually sells poor quality heroin. The $60 isn’t that horrible sized either, but it is on the small side. This dope was the first dope that felt like real heroin, and not fentanyl, in a long time. I was able to do a lot without being in sleepy zombie mode or ODed. The high was more euphoric and long lasting. I did finish the whole $60 in the hour I was there though. I let both smooth and his uncle smoke my rock and end up getting 4 giant hits off it myself making it not a bad deal. My ears ring but i don’t throw up.


As I expected I shouldn’t have bought that much crack. Only the first 2 hits were good. It leaves me shaky with a lot of anxiety despite the heroin kicking strong. Smooths uncle makes a big deal of me sharing the crack and offers to have his man drop me off a pack for free to try. Smooth flips out at this attempt to poach me as a customer but it doesn’t escalate. I looked at my phone and saw I was going to be late for work and did the last of my shit.


Thankfully the crack was fading enough so I could at least appear normal on the outside when I entered work. Or at least normal enough where no one said anything. I work with a bunch of straight laced Palestinians who would have cut into me if they suspected I was high. I genuinely love them. Eventually the shaking and anxiety cease and I can enjoy the heroin. I don’t get why I even speedball since every time I do just heroin it’s better. 


I do very well at work for awhile but quickly become emotional as is common with heroin. My post on reddit had gotten 8k upvotes and was huge. I know it sounds lame but I was really proud of this. I see myself as such a loser, never been able to create art. But I’ve had a few really huge forum threads over the years. If I compiled it all it’d probably be 100 pages of a book and have 500k-1 million views, ten thousand comments. Not just random message board posts, legit essay style pieces and long responses to questions as well as tons of short stories. All chronicling this horrible addiction of mine. It’s weird to be such a nobody in life… but online so many people enjoy my writing and wish me support. It hurts me that Sarah dislikes this. It’s not even her making fun of it, calling it lame. It’s that she just doesn’t care… she wouldn’t take the time to bother to read it unless it pertained to her and she could be upset with it. When I told her about the numbers of views and comments I achieved all she said was not to write about her.  


I tried to apologize to her for some past wrongs and she tells me I bother her with the shit I say. I don’t get why she’s with me as it just seems like she hates me. As the night got worse I told her I was struggling and asked for some help, maybe just to be assured I’m loved but she has gone to sleep and doesn’t respond.


The whole shift at work I was tossing and turning in my brain over spending the last $70 of my paycheck or getting Sarah a gift. I ended up confessing my cravings to my coworkers who took my phone and made it so smooths number was both deleted and blocked so I couldn’t find it again. I wish I wouldn’t have gotten high in the first place. I will likely have minor withdrawals tomorrow. I am still proud I won that battle though. Before this at work I got very emotional and upset inside after being minorly chastised for making a few small mistakes on orders. I kept an calm face throughout though. After Khalid deleted Smooths numbers I gave him a hug. I make $8 an hour under the table cooking burgers for a Palestinian who did 10.5  years in the feds for money laundering. I work with 2 stoners, a gay Albanian immigrant whose Americanized, one dude fresh from Yemen who I am good friends with despite him not knowing much English. The rest are Palestinians. Being around so many middle easterners reminds me of high school but I’ve grown to really love the people I work with. All the wonderful Muslim people who wish me the best and provide real friendship make me question some of the political beliefs I subscribe to. I am in no way conservative, at least not like other conservatives. I’m not one of these people calling for us not to basically ignore all these acts of terror. However when I see articles that reflect this viewpoint they seem hateful and I question if they’re on the right side. Too many Muslim people have just been too good of friends to me throughout life.


I came back to Derrick and Dustons and smoked. Derrick has been taking bars for days and it makes me sad to see addictive behavior in him as he just generally seemed like a stoner. 


I get picked up at 11am and have to get some sleep. Maybe I’ll get Kratom tomorrow. I hope that for once Sarah and I can just get along and I can enjoy being with her. Maybe I’ll just submit to everything just to avoid fighting. I think I will, half to see that happens, and half because I want to remember what it’s like to just spend the night with the girl I love without arguing, just enjoying each other’s company. I doubt it will happen but the goal sounds nice so maybe it will be worth eating shit. The downside is that there is a very slim chance this will work and we’ll probably still fight and I’ll have played yellow for nothing.
Best of luck 



**1-18 2:17am**


Just got out of work and I’m smoking a joint at Derricks. Today was a rough day at work but my drug intake has been greatly reduced. On Monday I did probably 5 or 6 $20 packs, Tuesday I did 3, and today just 1. I’m going to try to just take Kratom tomorrow and ween myself down. I feel retarded for getting a physical addiction again but I’ve done it a million times so I’m apathetic to any regret. 


I’ve been getting the $20s through Rachal whose been living with me in the motel. She’s a butch lesbian so it’s not weird and although there are some idiosyncrasies of hers I dislike for the most part she is easy to live with. She’s been trustworthy and I enjoy her company so I’ve let her stay.


The dope she gets is weird, but good. It’s little light red rocks that kind of look like make up. It even draws up pink/light red. It comes in little tiny ziplock bags like I used to see in east Detroit. The guy lives right next to the motel and most times we can cop within 20 or 30 minutes total. This feels like real heroin, I’ve gone irresponsibly hard on it two days in a row and didn’t fall out. Instead I was nodding hard, even when standing up. It remind me of when I first came home from prison and was getting high like in the old days. I’ve been booking Rachel up fat in exchange for using her connection.


I have to get to college Wednesday. If I don’t get my classes set now I never will. I’m fairly confident I will get it done but you never know with a junky.


I’ve got to lower my weed and drug intake then quit. I’m going to start making a daily goals list. Today I didn’t smoke a cigarette.


Today is the first day of the week I go into work without any heroin in me and it’s a 9 hour shift. It’s going to be hard not to smoke weed after that one. I do notice Kratom holds me over better than heroin.


**1-18**

Not a bad first day off heroin, but I only took the Kratom 3 hours ago. The 30 half gram capsules of Kratom make me actually feel slightly good, above sober baseline, but yet the heroin withdrawal creeps below the surface. Even though my mood is decent and my outlook positive there’s a tainted feeling running deep within my bones that I’ve come to associate with coming off a heroin binge more than withdrawal. If I have been clean a few months and binge for 2 days I will not feel withdrawal but more of a hangover. The main symptom of which is a generally scummy, sickly feeling, but nothing close to actually being sick. It serves as a strong warning I never heed.


It’s 4 hours after the Kratom dose now and I’m hitting the other vices hard. I’ve drank two large glasses of real coffee and I find I crave instant and feel the familiar nostalgia of the coffee I used to make in prison. I rounded scoop Keefe Alturo blend instant coffee, 2 non sugar sweetener, and a scoop of whey protein.


**1-19** 


Relapsed today kind of bad. I blew $150 in about an hour. I barely got anything out of it so at least it won’t kick my withdrawals back in too long. My grandmother sent me some money so it wasn’t a huge financial loss and I’ll still be able to meet my goal of buying an Xbox one. 


I woke up after after maybe 3 hours of sleep already in pretty mild withdrawals. Smooth had been calling me which was my first trigger. I was supposed to go to College today but had no bus fare and was withdrawing too hard. When I come back from home Monday I’m going to grab some Kratom and get a ride to college so I can’t procrastinate any further. This is my last week and I absolutely have to make this happen.


I ended up caving and had my grandma send me $120 and called Smooth. He was over in about ten minutes which is really rare for the doorman. I spent the $10 I had on me and the shot took me off E. After all the dope I did I never got much beyond that. 


When I went to pick up the Western Union I ran into Rachel who was on her way to cop. I gave her $20 to grab me one of her bags. When she returned with it she told me her dealer had ran out of baggies and put both of ours in the same bag which was a lie and a way for her to take half of the $20 I paid for. I had trusted her more than this but it didn’t surprise me when she did it. I don’t plan on fucking with her anymore.


I ended up getting a dime of dope, followed by a $50 more dope, a $20 of crack, a $15 of heroin and $10 of crack, followed by another $15 of heroin and $10 of crack on front. So now I have to see him to pay him back. I’m going to try my hardest not to get more which shouldn’t be hard since his dope sucks. If I had a reliable connect for good dope I’d be a lot worse off right now.


I can’t stand being a slave to so many substances and I don’t know how I’m going to kick them all in time for school. The withdrawal won’t be too bad and I might just maintain on Kratom. I just have to come to the decision not to pick up the phone and call the dopeman. Once I get in school I’ll have something to drive me. I moved here to get away from drugs but your vices have a way of finding you.


I remember how I found heroin here in Ypsi. I was living at the ¾ house at the time but was already doing Kratom and smoking weed. I was walking home from from work one day and saw a skinny dude with coke bottle glasses smoking a cigarette. I needed a light so I struck up a conversation. As we were smoking he asked if I smoked herb, I assured him I did. He then asked me if I did acid and once again I said yes. I wanted some bud so I went up to his apartment and scored. I deduced he was a junky pretty quick but it was a week or two before I made the call and asked if he could get dope. That was the beginning of all my serious problems here in Ypsi. 


Brian’s apartment was basically a trap. It was technically his girlfriend, Katy’s apartment but he ran it. Brian was something of a professional middle man, the type that supports his habit by having both an amazing connect and a pretty good clientele of people unable to score for themselves. Dealers would often hang out at the apartment to sell as well. I went through Brian for a while before he fucked me over on some packs. I ended up meeting Rachel at Brian’s but didn’t actually hang out with her until later.


Sarah and I have been getting along and she has a job interview Monday so I’m very proud of her. For all the problems we’ve had I know she really loves me and has stuck by me through numerous county jail bits and parole/probation violation programs. I see her Sunday and I won’t be feeling too well from lack of heroin so I hope we can get along. When I’m half dead from withdrawal it always makes me feel better just to have her there with me.


I need to make a plan. Today is Friday and I’ve already fucked up today. A bottle of 30 Kratom caps is $10. I’m going to try to buy 3 tomorrow for Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. Tomorrow will be a rough shift with only Kratom but Sunday shouldn’t be too bad since I don’t work. Monday I’ll take my Kratom and go to college to sign up for classes. If I need to get another bottle to make it through work then so be it. Once I get 3 days taking just Kratom I should be over the worst of it. I refuse to dose Kratom more than once a day which means about half of a day is spent in withdrawal since the Kratom doesn’t hold me a full 24.


I’ve been stressing about Sarah tonight as is typical after drug use. When I’m in the right state of mind I don’t stress more than I need to. I worry about her being with other men but more I worry about her not loving or wanting me anymore. Like maybe she just talks to me and sees me once a week as a favor to me. I can’t expect her to stay in every night though, we aren’t even technically together. It’s hard to hold down a girl when you aren’t physically there. In reality she makes time for me me every week and we talk every day so I shouldn’t worry so much. Lately I’ve been the one to text first though and that sucks. I just want her to be totally in love with me again. Sometimes I get these fleeting thoughts of suicide that tell me people would understand if I killed myself. Like Sarah would understand how much I love her and how much it hurt not to have her heart. Maybe the courts, judges, and POs would understand how hard of a battle it is for me to get clean, such a battle that I killed myself instead of fighting. These thoughts fade though and even in withdrawal I don’t feel suicidal. Withdrawal makes me apathetic to everything… my life, my problems with Sarah. Sometimes i wonder if it feels better to be half-high and suicidal or withdrawing and empty. 


It felt therapeutic to write that. I want people to eventually read these and I feel like writing about my girl problems is boring. There’s nothing more pathetic than a clingy boyfriend and I don’t want to be that.

On a lighter note things were pretty wild at the crack motel today. I heard 4 instances of prostitutes fucking loudly with the fake screams and moans common to prostitutes. Then when I was smoking a cigarette in the hallway I saw a couple exit a room and begin arguing over crack.
“Give me my half! I have the shooter”

“Break it and half and let me pick mine!” 

“You aren’t getting the pipe until you break me off!”

Eventually the girl busted out the crack pipe to her mans dismay, as they were only a few feet from me.

“He doesn’t care! He lives in Ypsi!” She said in regards to me seeing them smoke. I had just taken a hit myself, little did they know. I left them to argue and as I was walking back to the room I saw the Indian female manager quickly moving towards then and was glad I wasn’t going to be around for that.


It’s almost the end of the work shift now and I asked Derrick if he wanted to smoke after but he’s just going home and going to sleep so it looks like I’m going to be all alone in the motel room. The room feels like a jail cell during these times and I’m certain I’m going to break down and start crying the moment I’m alone. I think I’ll put on a podcast and try to forget my situation. Hopefully I’ll sleep late and won’t have to suffer too many hours alone by myself. There’s nothing to look forward to until Sunday when I see Sarah. I think if I looked at things objectively I’d see that it’s over, that it’s been over, that it wasn’t that good to begin with. I don’t want to accept that because I couldn’t imagine feeling more alone than I already do.


I think I’ll post these on the opiates subreddit and see what kind of response I get.

7rp2q1,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rp2q1/that_binge_last_week_on_sleep_deprivation_and/,0,https://redd.it/7rp2q1,sloan_fitch,That Binge Last Week. On sleep deprivation and being on time for work.,"I was on day two of a dope binge. The night before I barely slept three hours if that much because I was ripping bag after bag. After a long work day I went to visit a friend's house for a few hours ~~to work on something~~  and I didn't get home 'til a little after about 5AM. When I was ready to leave my friend was nodding out in standing position and I was just like ""dude I'm leaving now, 'nuff stalling.""

I think it was the night before where I was at another friend's house working on a project with them but I got home much earlier, a bit before 3AM.

Anyway, back to that night where I got home at 5AM. It was day two of my binge and I was already quite sleep deprived. An hour early while I was sitting at my friend's kitchen table I kept snapping into ""day dream"" states. I don't know what you call it but it also continued once I got home to my desk. 


&nbsp;

These daydreams are always peculiar but usually nothing negative. This time they were a bit off-putting. Like dark flashbacks, but they weren't flash backs to any thing in particular. It's like one second I'm in a day dream where I'm at work talking to a person, then I'm back at my desk and it feels like I was just at a different place at a different time of the day. Sort of disorienting I suppose. Despite nothing intrusive happening in my thoughts, I just felt negative as fuck. Maybe it was because I lacked control. Maybe it was because it was the second day of sleep deprivation. I don't remember two a day dope binge with sleep deprivation in the past. I usually get a good night's sleep on the second night regardless of my dope consumption.

&nbsp;

Well, I really don't know how to describe it but I felt ""dark"" while fading in and out of these innocuous daydreams. Aside from it being the second night of sleep deprivation, I did consume a lower amount of dope than I did on day one.

Maybe the reduction in dope compared to the prior day affected my serotonin levels? Not quite withdrawal, just some psych effects.

&nbsp;

Well I had work at 11AM. After eating at 5:15 I went to my desk to watch videos and digest my meal. I planned to go to bed soon. Next thing I know it's 7AM, I must've fallen asleep. I intended on getting up to go to bed but dozed off to sleep once more in chair in an upright position.


Woke up once more, at 9AM and probably said, ""ahh shit, time to get up."" So I did, and proceeded to put a Jimmy Dean sandwich in the microwave and made a cup of coffee on the Keurig. While the coffee was brewing, I went back to my desk to watch some videos and let the coffee cool down a little bit.


Then bam, I'm still at my desk but when I look at the time it's 10:58. This time I definitely said ""ahh shit..."" I had to be at work in two minutes, it takes me thirty minutes to get to work. I was surprised by that, I've never fallen back asleep after having physically gotten up to walk to my kitchen and sitting down. Perhaps this swivel chair is dangerously comfortable. 

Lesson, I don't know. Just thought it was a funny story. I'll set my wrist alarm next time well before bed as part of a alarm contingency plan. In fact I'll do that right now... Set four alarms on the wrist + the ones on my phone to ensure a single hit of the snooze bar does not defeat me in the AM.",1516434079.0

It's all scripted. I've never gotten into weed. Lol, that sounds funny, but never really liked smoking. Never cigs or whatever. I've smoked weed a few times, but it's been a long time.

What's your thoughts on the combo? Or what are your thoughts on weed as almost a replacement with some Kratom some nights to break up the opiates.

Trying to enhance movies/music/podcasts. I love waking up early, taking some oxy and throwing a podcast on (fatman on batman is my current fave) It's amazing. Used to use alcohol to achieve the same goal, enhance something else

So I'm just a nerd who is curious. Never expected to be addicted to anything. I have a great weed hookup for quality stuff according to a family member who is a super stoner. Maybe I'll try making edibles.

this happened years ago. probably 2014. i'm not the best storyteller but i think this one's worth sharing.


i was living with my mom and brother at the time and had just come home from picking up a rather large amount by my standards (0.75g - in 3 separate 0.25g bags). so i went in the bathroom and did my thing, got high, and went to room to chill. mostly browsing reddit and chilling with the dog.



then i realized that i was missing the 2 x 0.25g bags. i started worrying a bit and retraced my steps from my room to the bathroom and back, repeatedly. scoured my bedroom too. shit! what if my mom or brother found it!? i finally came to the conclusion that the dog must have eaten them and was slowly starting to come to terms with the fact that my dog might die and it would all be my fault. and my family would find out i was using again (i was hiding it from them at the time). idk if any of you guys have ever been in a situation like this but it fucking SUCKED! i love my dog to death and it slowly started to dawn on me that i'm gonna end up killing him because i was too worried about getting high to be responsible with my shit.



at this point i realized the dog was perfectly fine and would probably be showing some signs of an overdose if he had in fact eaten my dope so i started to calm down a bit. then i realized i didn't FULLY trace my steps - found my 2 bags untouched just sitting on the stairs that lead from the foyer into the main living area.

Im a long time addict, who has been usung steadily and everyday for around 8 years, currently Ive managed slightly over 2 months of clean time from Heroin.

My question is whether or not the heroin crisis is impacting highschoolers to the extreme levels which it is being shown inside the school.  I mean there must have been a warning poster, anti drug club, picture, artwork, or story every 15 feet about heroin or opiates.  It was almost as if the school was ground zero for a drug cartel or open air trap.  Kids these days are really pushing things hard if they are doing this shit instead of smoking some weed or drinking a few beers.  After seeing all that propaganda I was terrified for kids and their parents of this new generation.

This month I’ve taken less than I’m supposed to for a few days. Years ago I would blow through pills so fast it wasn’t even funny. 20-25 norcos a day plus Xanax and booze to add. I couldnt control myself. This is to all the pain patients out there. It’s possible to make them last. I have my girlfriend give me my daily doses and don’t go searching for the bottles. This is an agreement I made that was my idea. It works amazingly. No more withdrawals, no worrying about not passing drug tests, not having to supplement with kratom at the end of the month. This makes life so much easier. Anyone that calls you a hopeless addict for being in pain management has no idea what it’s like to live with that stigma. These meds make life bearable. Yeah I enjoy taking them. The joy comes from being able to function like a normal person for once. There is nothing wrong with that and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.

hi guys, this is my first post on reddit and i just want to get this out somewhere so here we go. i just turned 18 and i've been abusing all opaites that i can get my hands on for about 2 months. it started with me beeing bored and looking through our medecine cabinet and finding some tramadol and codeine. i tried both of those but did not get any effect at all which is a bit wierd but anyways, a week later i was over at my cousins house and stumbeld upon some oxys 10mg that my aunt had gotten for a surgey that was completly heald and they were just laying there so i stole like 4 pills or something. i tried it later that day and i was in love. i live realy close to my cousins and i know when they get home after school and work cuz we're basicly nieghbours so a couple of days later i decided to go back and steal the whole box ( we have a spare key for thier house). the following month consisted of me being high atleast every other day, even when i was over at my friends. i used to go in to thier bathroom and snort a pill or two. some of my friends knew about my drug habbit and wanted me to stop and i did so after about a month beacuse of multiple reasons, one was that i didn't want to get physicly addicted. but i was still mentaly addicted so started to steal everything i could get my hands on when i couldn't stand a life without being high anymore. i stole coughsyroup from my grandmother (old and not in use, which dosen't justify it), tramadol from a friends dad (was prescribed in 2012 and had not been touched since, still dosen't justify it). but the one i am most ashamed is what i have been doing recently, i've been stealing from my mother who had a back surgery about 2 weeks ago and the latest time i did so was about an hour ago, and that's why i'm writing this. i'm such a fucking brat, how the fuck can a son steal her moms medication when she has done everthing for me. i can't stand my self and this is the last time i'm doing it, i don't wanna hurt my mom but i just can't help myself. what i usally do is carefully take out a pill (oxy) from the blister pack, empty out the powder and then put the empty pill back in the blister and try to make it look as if it has not been tamperd with. the reason i've been stealing and not buying from a plug is becuase i live in a very small town and i dont have a lot of money. so instead of just staying away from this shit i steal it from the ones who need it the most. I AM DISGUSTED BY MYSELF, I'M HONESTLY THE WORST PERSON EVER. i'm such a spoled fucking asshole and i don't deserve the loving mother i have.

Lol. I only get tested once a month, when I have my appt too. Pretty sweet setup really. The sub is working fine, really well actually when you consider the pressures I’ve been under, it’s probably the main thing that’s kept me from going out and just destroying myself. 

So, I am trying to stay clean, but only sort of. I still like to get high. I still have some etizolam on the way, etc. I actually found that alcohol seems to have an especially strong reaction w bupe relative to other opioids. I had one (stiff) drink around noon the other day and was pretty fucked. Mostly, tho I don’t really feel a buzz when I take my dose (8mg). And it’s only been a few days on this script (before that did about 3-4 days on subs, then a couple days with just a little tramadol, then a day and a half totally clear). 

So I know I’m gonna have to figure out how my body responds to bupe on my own, but just like ballpark figures would be helpful. Like if I want to get high, how long do I have to wait? From what I’ve read it seems like I could skip a single dose (which I’ve been taking at noon) and sleep in the next day and try to make it a few hours, then get high. My tolerance was getting out of hand at the end and I’m naturally quite tolerant, so it’s hard to believe anything could get ME high. I got a plug on some good pressed roxis tho and that fent got me decently high at the end. I figure I’ll prob get settle into some kind of routine of taking a little tolerance break and shooting fent maybe a couple times earlier in the month, but stay stable on sub most of the time. 

I do worry about my tolerance but really 8mg of sub is plenty to make me feel ok even if i do spike my tolerance a little so that should be fine. Speaking of, i actually want to experiment with lower doses, as I think there really might be something to this “less is more” shit. I took 2mg after taking 8mg for about 4 days, went to my first meeting and fucking nodded out thru the whole thing. I was so embarrassed, but I really had no idea I could get those kind of effects from 2mg of sub (??).  If I could be fine on 2-4mg I’d be able to save at least a full dose every day, which sounds awesome obviously. 

So I guess that’s the one other question, can I/how can I get a buzz off of my subs themselves, while being on sub maintenance? Like today, I’m having really bad cravings and going through some unique emotional shit I won’t have to deal with so acutely later. I was thinking of crushing up half of another tablet and railing and/or boofing some. Would that give me a buzz like taking sub when I’m clean clean? 🤔 ? Or is there a ceiling/blocking effect at play that would make that a waste? Guess it’s worth one tab to find out. I don’t think they even really mind if I use a couple extra, they scheduled my appt slightly early “in case I run out early”. They’re actually really chill, they told me explicitly that it’s okay that I’m gonna piss dirty for cannabis every time. How about if I get down to 4 or even say 2mg/day - would I be able to double THAT dose and get high?

TLDR; how long should I wait after daily 8mg dose to get normalish effects from normalish dose of dope/fent? If I get some fent and don’t wait at all I can break through if I do enough, right? (I’ve OD’d before btw, spare me) Also wondering if it’s a waste to try to rail/boot an extra 4-8mg or something like that.",1516404005.0

For those that have used on the early tail end of vivitrol, what exactly does it feel like?  Do you still get a taste even if the high is blocked or reduced (I don't even get a taste)?  Do your pupils pin, etc.?  Be specific about what symptoms you have and do not have compared to normal.

Here's a quick rundown of the last 24 hours: My last shot was at 7 pm last night. I had to write a report that night so I took ~20 mg (at 8 pm) of meth to stay up and be productive. I stayed up until 5:30 at took 1.0mg clonazepam and 2 mg of lorazepam to fall asleep (I was starting to feel a little shitty the nut I didn't know for sure it was withdrawals). 

12pm
I woke up feeling rough, nothing too serious just lethargy, slightly aching bones and I was freezing cold despite the room being set to room temp. I had to go to work so I took 25 mg of meth to fight back the lethargy. 

Since I've gotten to work, temperature fluctuation have become noticeable and I've started dry heaving and having some stomach cramps. I've thrown up like 3 times but other than that I don't know what to think. The symptoms I just describe are the only ones I've got.

I had surgery about 6 months ago, and with that came prescribed DHC. 30mg tabs no apap, scripted roughly 240-320mg daily prescribed. I received what I think was IV didaliud(sp) before the op, and was given a whack think oxy10 a few hours previous to calm me as I had to wait a few hours in the hospital bed.

After the surgery those DHC got me LIT as fuck for a few days after having absolutely zero tolerance - as in never before consumed any opiates previously. But the high noticeably diminished as the weeks went on, and I started taking about 500-600mg a day.

I've always been interested in drugs, but truthfully thought opiates were just for junkies. Heck, I didn't really know DHC was an opiate! I researched for weeks about opiates, eventually landing here.

There is so much good information here, friendly mods and most of all love. The way everyone cheers each other on and comforts them in bad types is beautiful. 

I'm sorry your loss has been my gain in some ways. All the bad things that have happened to some of you, most of you. I have learned from all of your mistakes, I will never recreationally abuse opiates again, I will never climb that tolerance ladder looking for my next high. I will use them if I absolutely need to post surgery.

I'm going to run out before this month's refill. That means awful Opana WD and possibly having issues with the clinic I go to. Dad and I live several states apart but have never lost a bit of our closeness. We speak on the phone frequently. It's good to have someone who knows EXACTLY what you're going through with chronic pain, especially when it's close family. I finally broke down on the phone and told him what's going on (not quite the full extent; he doesn't need to know I'm already in WD. Knowing my Dad he could tell just by the way I sounded, though).

What does my awesome Dad do?

Immediately offer to get 12 in the mail to me Friday night before the post office closes so I will have them by Monday. I'll be mailing some of mine back up to him so he won't miss his pill count and he'll be saving me from the special hell that is WD. I was bawling my eyes out on the phone thanking him, telling him ""you don't have to do this, I've gone through WD before, I don't want to fuck up your pill count"" and his only response was ""I love you, and I'm your Dad, I'm not going to let you hurt if I can help it.... now please let me get off the phone so I can get these to you"".

So now I'm just waiting for the mail to get here on Monday. I'm learning that WD is easier to handle when you know you'e got something coming to you. I feel much more relaxed and much more able to internalize the idea that this feeling isn't going to last forever (or even a full 10 days like my WD usually do).

Also I've not been able to find diddly squat about how to if you really can turn CW into tar considering thats what the people around here are use to I would just feel much better about things if it was nothing other then the usual, not to mention I've heard that with one OZ of CW your able to turn it into 3 OZ's of good tar so if thats true I'd especially be interested in how to pull that off considering it would mean tripling my money once everythings done and delt with... So please any info that may be a help is much needed and I am grateful for all or any info you can share... Hope to getta comment or 2 soon...    ",1516540243.0

Cleaning up.,"I just smoked the last gram of BTH i had. I plan on cutting out opiates and cleaning up.  I had been using oxy for years and about a month or so ago made the switch to heroin.  I can honestly say I much prefer oxy... personally think the high is much better and I stay high longer. I have been planning my detox and this for awhile and have acquired a lot of stuff I hope will stave most of my withdrawals. I have one strip of suboxone, an ounce of Kratom, gabapebtin, clonidine, hydroxizine, and tramadol. I also just got put on my family's LA Fitness membership. I was wondering how I should take the meds. I plan on cutting up the suboxone... how long should I wait to take the first piece? I was thinking maybe about 12-24 hours from now and how should I divy out the other meds? I know the Kratom has to build up in our system in order to work so should I maybe start taking 2 capsules about 8 hours from now then continue with 2 capsules every four hours until this time tomorrow then increase to 4 capsules? As for the gym I plan on going to the sauna and maybe sweating out the toxins to maybe make the withdrawal process go faster? Then set a solid routine for working out... last time I got clean routine was everything... I think working out will help me tremendously in mood and general well being. I realize this is a shit post and we see at least a hundred a week on this sub but this is my one and only shitpost about getting clean I hope to make. The biggest reason for getting clean is because I am trying to get a job in a hospital/clinic setting and I want to pass my drug test on my own volition... it sucks because most hospitals in my state won't even hire you if you have nicotine in your system. I am also excited to save money. I remember last time I got clean I had more money than I knew what to do with(not really, I went out to eat A LOT) but anyways any advice any of you have for me on how to dole out the meds or any other advice I would greatly appreciate. I love you guys and this sub and admire the regulars on here who are clean and offer advice to others and offer their general input. Here is to hoping my will power is as strong as my desire to better my life. 💕",1516534390.0

I remember this fling I had with this chicky that I was feeding coke and my two friends made me feel what CEO'S or what someone elected into a powerful position would feel. It's an easy way to find something you can control over when your life is shit.

Even being a shitty middleman gives you that control and upper hand it's a dog eat dog world and the way to the top is ruthless. How submissive you will be or how willing you are to get to the top is what drives many to do the most disgusting things.

Their is no chain of command. You are your own boss. Even drug dealers, I'd rather cold cop than have someone tell me where to go, I'll get it on my own time and the thrill of that is alluring.

7rwblm,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7rwblm/5_more_days/,15,https://redd.it/7rwblm,JustWeightOnIt,5 more days,"I’ve been on probation for over 3 years. While I’ve used throughout that time this last year i had to really cut back. the first 2 years while it was only felony Probation so they didn’t really drug test all that much. The only reason i went back to jail was on me. It was because I got arrested for a failure to maintain lane that resulted in a wreck. I had 2 seizures from benzo WD so I got kicked out of jail. Did a little over a month (3 for 1 since I was a trustee) for that. 

Anyways the last year I was on misdemeanor and in my county those people don’t fuck around. Drug tests started at twice a month. Well I failed the first one for xanax (rx’d), pot, and alcohol. They saw my script for the xanax and let that slide but they still wanted to lock me back up for the pot and booze. I ended up running away to rehab for 3 months and the judge let me off with a warning. Then I missed a test on accident (I just forgot to call in) and he bumped my testing up to once a week.

About a couple months ago they found oxy in my system. That’s because the original tests they used looked for “opiates” which really meant anything that breaks down in to morphine. I figured that out before they did and kept using until the pulled the old switcheroo without telling me. She (my PO) called me and told me she was gonna revoke the rest of my time (like 6 months). I was freaking out until I got my prescription list from my pharmacy and saw I had a script of oxy 5s from a wisdom tooth extraction a year prior to all this. I told her I had oxys for an ongoing pain that I needed surgery to fix but since I was in school i didn’t have the time. She fucking believed me! 

So I continued to pop oxys a handful of times the last couple months. I did do some speedballs a couple months back but that was once the day after a drug test so I knew I would Be clean the next test because they reduced the amount to twice a month. 

So that brings me to today, 5 days away from being put on non report (no testing, no monthly meetings, NO MORE PAYMENTS — $50 per meeting and $35 for each drug test) and guys/girls I couldn’t be happier. I’ll probably cut back on the oxy consumption and pick up some high quality Mary Jane and some extracts(my girlfriend just bought a $4000 piece to smoke from and I still have my mothership) I might have a couple beers as well to top it all off. I’m so glad I don’t have to rely on oxys to get a buzz when I want.

the real risk people are overlooking is hitting your head if you fall down - i have done that multiple times as well as down the staircase twice, in a classroom once, and twice while i was driving where i wrecked into guardrails on the interstate going 50-60 mph. both times i hit the windshield with my head and cracked it as well as concussing myself unconcicous. i would of defiinitely died and went thru the windshield had i not worn a seatbelt but i always do wear one thank god.

so yea i think i should be dead but im still here and i wonder why a lot of the time and it depresses me for some reason.  i was a very bright person but these concussions and seizures have definitely fucked my cognition up a lot.  i feel like i have super ADHD and even dyslexia",1516516379.0

We have had a mutual understanding that if any of our friends were going through a hard time, we'd give them a place to crash and help them out. 

There's an old friend of the bf's, let's call him Bill. He used to do dope, but has been clean for a few years. Bill has had a rough time in life for the past three years. His long term gf left him, and ever since can't keep a place to live, even though he works as a bartender in a major city five nights a week. What few teeth he's got are not looking good. He's skinny and puffy faced. 

Bill told the bf that the apartment he'd been staying in was locked shut by the marshall because the person he'd been paying rent to had taken the money and skipped town. Bill is supposedly sleeping at the bar a few times a week after his shift. He sometimes shows up at 2am, or sometimes shows up at 10am and then goes up to the the attic space where we have a spare bed and crashes up there all day.

The second night he crashed here, he stayed up there for 15 hours. He came down to pee, I chatted with him briefly but he cut that short, saying he had to get going and try to get his stuff out of the apartment somehow. He went back up to the attic, and.... there was silence for the following hour and a half. Then he came back down and said he'd fallen back asleep. He went out, traveled over an hour all the way to his work to see if he was needed (instead of just calling?) and then came back two hours later.

A different night he left our apartment at 5am because he said he couldn't sleep, and didn't return for a day or two.

Bill came by two days ago and smelled like a homeless person. No exaggeration. It wasn't normal BO or staying in the same clothes for a few days. It was intense. It was the kind of smell that people get off the bus to avoid. I don't understand how he can even be allowed to work like that. I understand that he doesn't have access to his clothes and whatnot, but he can borrow something of my bf's, and we have a washing machine in my building. Or, fuck, why not clean your shit in the sink, even?!

Nothing about this guy doesn't scream full blown ""junkie"" to me. He doesn't hang out with the bf when he's here, he just goes up to the attic.  

For the past week and change he's been claiming that he's getting sick. Some kind of flu. 

I've spoken to my bf about my concerns, but he's firmly on the side of optimism. He could be sleeping a lot because of depression. He might be getting sick because he's sleeping at his work. 

Tonight Bill told me he kept waking up more and more sick. He's got a fever. I ordered us food, he said he'd like soup. When it arrived, he decided against eating and went back upstairs. 

I do not want to put my boyfriend in the position to have to throw his old friend out into the cold. If Bill is struggling with drugs, I would gladly let him stay here to kick, and support him as much as we can. I just had two very close people to me die of overdoses last summer. If I can help someone out of this hell, I will.

But if he's at the point where he can't keep a place to stay, is smelling like a homeless person, and is lying about his situation, that's a dangerous level of addiction to have in my home. I am poor, and can't afford to have anything of mine be hocked for drugs. I wouldn't even take it personally. Being a junkie is like having a demon possess you. He's not going to be in control of his better judgement.

Sorry this is a bit rambly.

What would you suggest as a not shitty way of dealing with this situation? What are some ways I could determine conclusively if drug use is the culprit? What is the best way to approach this? I have gone up to the attic and looked around once, but saw no blood or wax paper. The boyfriend said Bill would probably not shoot, though. There's no vomiting thus far, either. 

I just... I know what it is to feel utterly alone and abandoned, and I don't want Bill to feel that way. But I also don't want to end up in a bad situation.

TLDR; I think I have a junkie crashing with me. He's an old friend of my boyfriend's. What do I do?
_______________

UPDATE: Ok, so now I have proof he's using, as I just went up to the attic to shut off the lights, looked around, and found the orange cap to a hypo. My boyfriend is at work until after midnight, and Bill is supposedly coming back here in the near future, but who knows? fuck.",1516515952.0

The 17th was the last time I had a shot of heroin. It’s been a loooong year and a half but I’m damn proud of myself. And I successfully used pain meds while giving birth to my first child last June, only because I didn’t expect to have a c-section. But, I’m also on deferred disposition and court ordered in sober living. So honestly I’m not sure what’s actually keeping me sober, however I could’ve easily gotten high because my sober house BARELY drug tests. I mean like once a month or two. 

There’s a part of me that really does want to stay clean, but a stronger side that’s telling me I can manage using again. I keep telling myself it was never that bad, and I didn’t use long enough, or my bottom wasn’t low enough. But I don’t have to experience that suffering if I choose not to. My life is pretty fucking good, and if the only thing I’m worrying about now is losing sleep due to a small child then I’ll take it.

I’ve spent the last week on a little oxycodone bender. Had some ancient 5mgs on hand from a surgery, and boredom with my sobriety got the best of me.

I know, FIVE MILLIGRAMS. I even cut em in half most of the time. But I’m very small (5’ and 100lb) and haven’t had any chemical fun, not even a drink, in several months. For the last 6 days, I’ve had between 10-20mg every day, spaced out enough to feel just a bit happier and lighter between waking and bedtime. It was fun!

Today, all day, I’ve had what feels almost exactly like a particularly nasty booze hangover. Stupid, anxious, lethargic, etc.

My question is how long you think this will last? All the info I’m finding online regards higher doses and/or longer-term use, so I’m hoping an expert in here will be able to tell me I’ll be ok come Monday? Would a little tapering help, or just drag this out?

Thanks guys!

So me and my SO do blues occasionally. Actually, we occasionally take breaks from blues. I make good money, so she doesn't have to work. She worked when we first met, and my life was worse than it is now, and it allowed me to get a somewhat grip on things. I buy my blues from IRL sources. My SO and her brother really like weed, i stopped smoking years ago. Since the darknet offers a better selection and price to the weed thats around, i tend to get it from there for her and her brother, along with other drugs that people request from time to time. I will sometimes get samples of opiates that i havent had or havent had in a long time. A few weeks ago i got some BTH and smoked it. It was okay. Then i got .2 of some ECP the other day. Normally i can bang two blues at once and it gets me level (add another two and im probably nodding), but this .2 had me level all day. I couldn't get too high, as we were supposed to be on a break from using blues. A day or two later i order a gram. It comes from only a state away. Im sitting here waiting for the postman to come to deliver my package. I last used suboxone last night, so im going on over 12 hours from last dosage, as of right now. I tell people i know about this stuff, and they are amazed. I should be making a killing with this stuff. If you are lucky, you can get good $90/g stuff here, but you can almost guarantee without a doubt, that it wont be $90 next time, or it will cut to shit next time, if not both. The current rate is about $160/g - if you can get it. And half the time its mixed with fent. I can get this insanely good stuff for $160/g or less (if i buy more).

Not sure where i was going with this. I guess im just killing time before the postman comes. Im hoping he comes while my SO is out (like now), because last time he put it in a stuffed duck, and my SO was wondering why i got shipped a stuffed duck (that had a obv cut down its back), luckily it got the product out before my SO investigated.",1516641583.0

I can't be the only one","To make a long story short, I started suffering chronic migraines around the spring of 2016. I saw a neurologist who threw a bunch of pills at me over the summer. I didn't get much relief, so out of frustration I turned to pills. In the winter of 2016, I discovered kratom. By the summer of '17, I was taking at least 60 grams of it per day.

Due to various circumstances I could no longer afford it, so I stopped cold turkey. That's when I was hit with the worst headache of my life, far worse than any migraine I ever had. The worst part was, it never went away. I could go on and on about the soul-crushing, all-consuming pain, about how I didn't eat or sleep or days, but the short version is, I was hospitalized for trying to end my life.

Fast forward a bit and I managed to survive long enough to be placed on 12 mg/day of suboxone. It was great for about two weeks, then wouldn't you know, another transcendently painful, multi-day headache. I survived by taking multiple strips and being placed on a seizure medication that took the edge off.

This process repeated about once every two weeks or so, till I finally decided to hell with all opiates, and quit suboxone cold turkey.

I've been off subs for almost three months. I've had a chronic headache this whole time. My neuro knows about it and has thrown a few pills at me but nothing has worked out. I think he's desensitized to me honestly. It's different from a migraine, it's a very blunt pain that often encompasses my whole head with no nausea.

Am I the only one in the universe with a chronic headache like this? Is there anything else I can do. I can't imagine living the rest of my life in this much pain. I was hoping that as my tolerance went down and my brain healed the pain would get better, but there doesn't seem to be any end in sight. Would agmatine help at all? I still do have some tolerance, as I sampled some kratom last week and it took 9 grams to feel anything.",1516639829.0

I was scared to overdose, but also I didn't want to underdose. Can you druggies tell me how do I know when I've taken enough heroin for an optimal experience? 

For example, if I feel nauseous after 1h, or if my stomach is a bit ""tense"", is it a red flag that I should not smoke more until a few hours?

Here's the link to a new one I posted https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7so5ru/magic_mushrooms_and_rape/

I worked in a factory for a while with this guy we'll call T. Long story but we got fired at the same time for being a bit loud and obnoxious together.

T was a dirty looking guy, his teeth were like little yellow and black spikes - the ones that remained at least - and he generally stank. He mentioned he played guitar and I'd recently got obsessed with the guitar and figured I could learn something from him. He talked a big game, and told me about this 70s fender strat he had which was the only thing that had survived a previous house fire, how he had played in all these bands yadadda.

We grabbed about 12 cans of beer and walked to his house, about 20 minutes away. He listened to some good music and was decent at guitar (the strat in question was a fire damaged piece of pawn shop shit) but he made it sound alright.

We got pretty hammered and he broke out a little mirror/snorter/razor blade combo which he said was 'ether'. Now at this point I'm starting to assume this guy is a bit nuts, but fuck I obviously bash out a line and dust it off anyway. It was a weird, uncomfortable kind of high. I have no idea what that slightly grey powder was. It came on pretty hard though, and before you knew it we had decided we were going to go camping for 3 days in the local woods and began to pack. T had been in the military and had hoarded a bunch of camo, night vision goggles and gas-pellet rifles. We spent a bit of time running about his house dressed like soldiers with night vision goggles before things got dark. At some point between being shot at in the dark by a stranger and filling a bag with camping shit T brought through some LSD tabs - later turned out was 'P1LSd' -and we dropped two each.

T had a room mate called L. She was obviously transgender, and was very nice. I thought about trying to smash that later on in the night.

T began to get a bit delusional and described being part of military tours which pre-dated him by about 20 years, and made some pretty bold claims to venues he'd played at, but I shrugged it off because I was now ridiculously high and began questioning if his claims could really be true.

An hour or so passed of T rambling and pulling his socks off and putting them back on relentlessly before he stopped dead in his tracks, one sock on his foot, the other on his hand like a puppet and he stared me right in the eyes. ""Bigmuffblues, you know L she's a good girl, me and her are real close"". 

I got pretty paranoid, his death stare combined with his ice pick teeth were amplified and magnified to near giant proportions by the acid, and he spoke slowly and with intent for the first time in hours. I thought I had maybe been a bit flirty with his transgender roomie, who I could now see was basically his girlfriend. My anxiety caused me to spew out what I felt like was a 25 minute condensing lecture about how I'm cool with transgender people, and she wasn't his SO I was going to try my luck myself.

T shot to his feet immediately and began kicking anything over nearby. His guitar, half-full cans of beer, a small Bluetooth speaker. He was shouting so fast I had no idea what he was saying, and as I rose to my feet he picked up a bright orange m16 pellet gun and pointed it at my head. I sort of sniggered at him, so he shot me right between the eyes about 6 times.

He began shouting how L wasn't transgender and I needed to apologise. L had since run through and all 6 foot of her stood in the hallway shouting things like ""T it's okay he's just really high leave him alone!!"". At this point I am out of my fucking mind with intense rage, and I began to shout at the two of them somewhere along the lines of ""YOU CRAZY FUCKS, I DONT CARE IF YOU BOTH HAVE A DICK, YOU SHOOT ME AGAIN WITH THAT GUN ILL BURN THIS PLACE TO THE GROUND"". 

Now thankfully they believed I was as crazy as I made out because I for sure thought this dude was gonna kill me, but they moved out the way and let me walk out -bouncing off every wall on the way.

That was the end of the story for a long time, and I told it that way for many years until not so long go. A friend wanted to see this girl L so I looked her up. She's actually a very tall, good looking girl and is definitely not a transgender man.",1516634939.0

Two years ago my ex od'd and I got an ambulance there immediately and her life was spared. So they decided to take her to the hospital to make sure everything was ok. 
    There was no dope or needles or anything like that around so the cops were pissed and found a box of weed pipes under her couch and decided to take me straight to jail over it. It's seriously some bullshit. I paid a lawyer $1,000 and he got it reduced to a littering ticket instead of just getting it dropped. Fine whatever. I paid him and his job was done and all I had to do was pay the court $150 and it's all good. Well I missed the payment date and my lawyer decides to file a motion to withdraw from my case. He's got my 1,000 bucks and now I'm being charged with whole original charges which were possession of marijuana and paraphernalia even though there wasn't even any weed there. 
I'm just so pissed because I just got out of a 72 hour lockdown over it and now have to start the whole trial again. I'm gonna use a different lawyer this time and hopefully just get it dismissed. Its fucked because they even wrote in the report that I didn't live there and the box wasn't in plain sight either. How am I the one responsible for those pipes? There's not even proof I was using other then just being there I guess. 

TLDR: saved someone's life from an od in their own home and subsequently went to jail for their weed pipes.

A girl I had a crush on snorted up and told me her experience with drugs; she explained everyone in her social circle who did drugs and got into opiates at some point overdosed and died eventually.

This does seem to be the pattern I have noticed. I am only into weed, psychedelics and benzos right now; I discovered drugs a year ago and have yet to touch cocaine or any opiate unless kratom counts. I feel like coke is inevitable due to its prevalence in my area but opiates I could easily avoid for the rest of my life, and I plan to continue avoiding opiates until I am at least 25 where I will reevaluate whether I still want to die.

So my question is, if you were approached by a drugged out moron who wants to go out a drugged out moron, would you recommend this person opiates over Xanax?

On the other side, 2018 is the year we're supposed to say fuck Xanax but if not Xanax for the (currently) RC non-suicidal 'social' druggies then are opiates a better choice, or are they truly a sure path to eventual overdose and death?",1516603958.0

So  I've been pretty fucking broke as of late. Not because of drugs, per se but life in general. Expensive family illnesses (plural) no hours at work, etc. I've taken up begging from time to time - not highway offramp with a sign sort of begging but asking folks at gas stations and other places in town.

I've undertaken this several times now, in various states of dress and with various stories - most bullshit and some 100% true and can tell you guys what worked and what didn't.

None of this should be a surprise to any of you but the better you dress the better the payout, or rather, the higher the frequency of payout. The worse you dress/appear the worse your returns will be, regardless of your story.

I usually use the gas storyline:

""Hey *really* sorry to bother you (look really, REALLY embarrassed and **super** uncomfortable) but I just called my wife and after calling me an idiot, (insert chuckle) told me that I left my wallet at home next to the front door on the little table and now I'm stuck here with no way to get home and I live about 25 minutes away. Do you *happen* to have a few bucks or enough for a gallon or two of gas I could borrow? I'm *extremely* uncomfortable asking like this but I really don't know what else to do.""

It's a pretty good patter, I think, but really misses as much as it hits in regard to actual cash. I've had people put $20 in my tank off of their card, one guy filled my tank entirely which was nice since I'm always out of gas anyway.

Generally I end up with $2-$5 after trolling for quite a while which sucks.

Today I put on black dress slacks, a Polo/Izod shirt with the first button buttoned, white t-shirt underneath and decent shoes.
I immediately felt like I was legitimate. Like, no matter what story I was about to tell was the *truth* because I looked and felt like someone legitimate.

Today's story was this: (I'm changing the career to protect my personal life)

""Hey boss/sir/man/buddy/hon I'm a Network Administrator/Computer guy that is in town working on a company's computer and the owner left for the day and forgot to pay me. The office assistant and I haven't been able to reach her/him for the last couple hours and I'm stuck in town without any gas and live way over in <some-ville>. Can you spare a few bucks so I can get back that way?""

**additional banter**
""I don't think it was intentional, I just think she forgot that she needed to be there when I finished the work.""

""The secretary and I had been trying to reach her for a good couple hours before she had to go home herself and now I'm just freaking stuck here.""

This last banter yielded me $25 in about an hour which was all I was looking for. It felt like an honest situation and the people I pitched it to seemed engaged in the story as well.

I basically dressed for the part. If you look like just an ""Office Joe""/Yuppie type, people are much more likely to feel a sense of camaraderie with you and empathy towards your situation.

Now that I know I have to use all the subs I have left, I feel like mentally this is it. I'm way to chicken shit to handle wds again without subs. 

Here's hoping the subs work for me by using them a bit more liberally to drain my stash. Then once they are gone, that's it!",1516577880.0

Today I decided to take a much smaller dose at 4mg and I felt fine for a while but the nausea soon returned. I cannot fuck with this shit if it’s going to make me nauseous. 

How bad is it going to be for me to quit subs after just 2 days?  I’ve take suboxone before, recreationally, at 8-12mg daily and have not experienced any nausea or neg sides that I can recall, any idea in why I’d feel them now?

The drug scene is ever so prevalent as has been as long as I can remember. I remember hearing my teachers in elementary discuss with coworkers about our town being a meth town and a heroin town. Show up to school and there's orange cones in the building taking up most of the hallway that has it's walls covered in sea animal paintings to put copper wire back in, because of those ""fuckin tweakers"". 

Alright, so then I knew. Drug addicts do things that have a very clear impact on the world outside of the drug scene and they blatantly don't give a singular fuck. Okay cool deal I can handle that, at least they're not hurting other people right? At least not as often as they're stripping copper? 

And even if they were going to hurt someone else, say someone else even in the drug scene, they'd do it nice and quick so they can go back out to the garden at 4 in the morning and cut slugs in half with scissors, right?

I'm beginning to see I'm very wrong. Very recently my homegirl was kidnapped. She was MIA for almost 4 days before I got to her. I had the location of the biggest city in the county over (big ass city, to my standard anyway) and 3 unrecognizable names to work with. She was on foot, phone broken, and in captivity. I played investigator for 2 straight days and got like 90% of the order of events down to the very hour, shortly after I went to the city and found her myself. I called the county police twice and they basically told me knock knock jokes over phone. This is the second time I've rescued her from a serious, legitimate, low odds of survival kidnapping in the last year. Both times she was beaten and bloodied. I got her home safe the night before last, yesterday she was arrested and sent to jail. So naturally I've been runnin around at night pulling moves with her older brother lately, who as I learned last night has also been kidnapped in the last 12 months, also near death experience. 

The people who kidnapped him live in a trap about 3 miles from where I stay, been in the house a handful of times. I semi-often pull moves with a kid who lives there, who also, as it turns out, has been beaten and kidnapped and gotten away as well. Last night I put all of this in front of me and just started hitting people up to see what kinda answers I would get. 

It's 10. You guys 10 different people that I actively see in my life have been kidnapped, almost killed and gotten away. The farthest back was 7 years ago. There are more people I'm going to try. I also know of some cases where the victim did not make it out alive, though these are few and far between. So my question is...

What in the rimjob loving fuck is going on here? Did I miss a town meeting or something? Did I not get that memo? Is that email in my spam folder? Because what the fuck. So now I'm asking you guys too. Is kidnapping a common thing in the drug scene you belong to?",1516731913.0

**H a different beast**

---

I tried heroin out of curiosity, just smoking it on foil, never tried a needle, 2.5g bag of brown H.

It feels amazing, it is cheap at first, you think you can control it. But the truth is, you will pay back for the pleasure it gives you, and pay back much more than you received.  

Once or twice a week became weekend speedball binges, which became daily binges or at least H when I ran out of the white stuff. One day, I binged too hard and slept for ~ 16 hours and woke up withdrawing.  

WD is hell. I'm a grown ass man and I was crying, no sobbing, in my smelly, sweat covered bed for 3 days (thank god I used for a short time, no longer than a month at a time), trying to find anything to get rid of this feeling.  

Thankfully, I realized I was going through WDs, and chose to stop taking H, even though I had a bit left, to detox myself to avoid leading to full-blown addiction.

---

Even after suffering through the ordeal, I thought I can handle this like I could handle all the other drugs I tried. I bought another 2.5g and tried to chip responsibly.  

**Boy was I wrong...**  

Little did I know, I was addicted to it already. I suffered through withdrawals after using another month, a couple days a week at first to daily use, to the point where I would smoke a bit of H, smoke a cigarette and immediately puke my guts out.  

 Thankfully, my second detox was just before Christmas when I had to go back home to an area where you really cant find drugs.  

After the second WD, that's when I realized that every time I try it, even just once, I would go into daily use within a week.  

---

**You may destroy your life like countless others.  
You may learn what it is like to WD, have depression and the point of view of a drug addict.  
All of this because of 5 grams of brown powder.**

---

Am I glad I tried it and got out in time with a rough spanking?  

To be honest, yes, I learned that 'junkies' are just people trapped by chemical dependency, not bad people.  

I learned that chemical pleasure is why we live this life, but also that naturally produced chemicals by means of exercise or living life to its fullest are so much more sustainable for long, happy, healthy life than the temporary pleasures that drugs provide.  

---

Anyone thinking of trying Heroin, know this. 

**You WILL love it, you WILL experience WD, it WILL be shitty, and you just MIGHT destroy your life in a matter of weeks**

It is only lucky circumstance that saved me from its clutches.  
It is nothing like any other drug I've tried.  

**Do not, under any circumstances underestimate it, because as soon as you do, she will make you her willing slave. Warm on the inside, but as cold as a rotting corpse on the outside.**

You stole from your parents that you cherish,  to get high. When you saw me you didnt kiss me, you ran towards my stash. Your getting high everyday with me, girl im a fuck up , dont follow my lead.

Im sorry i have no cash. I cant support two habits. Only mine. Oxy is pricey. Relax stop screaming. Im sorry. Where are you going to go ? Your parents already kicked you out. Girl stay with me please..

This is the fourth time i have to pick you up from a guys house. And even though were not together anymore i still tuck you in my bed when your sprung out. I make you eat so you can hide your ribs. I told you not to play with trains because they leave tracks. I watch you sleep and dry the sweat off your head even though its winter. I hold you tight all night, because i know youll be gone again as soon as theres light.

You use to have such a beautiful way of speaking. So intellectual, and from the heart. Deep conversations and ideas. Now im seeing foam come from your mouth. Youve only been out of the hospital for three days and you want more? Girl please stop. I love you so much. I want you to be sober again. Youre taking too much. If you must get high, slow down, or else youll end up killing yourself. She said , ""its called drug abuse for a reason"".

i havent seen you in a year. I hope your okay. I hope you wear diamonds instead of smoking crystals. I hope the only reason why your using needles now is because you went back to school and became a nurse. I hope the only track marks you see are the ones on the road. I hope your hair grew its color, i hope your skins brighter. The last time i saw you i begged for you to come with me to rehab. I even went a month sober to influence you. I told you i hate looking at you like this. You told me then dont look. I told you i love you. You smiled and told me, ""boy im a fuck up dont follow my lead"".

7sdbgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7sdbgs/unexpected_jj_win_possible_shitpost/,10,https://redd.it/7sdbgs,Scwolves10,Unexpected JJ win (possible shitpost),"As some of you know, I recently moved back home from a horrible southern state for drugs unless you know somebody. But I got back and am trying to set up my old/customers and old/new plugs. 

Anyways, I got a new connect yesterday that has gunpowder for a great price (I'll get a pic when I get more). I've been sick all day so I was trying to figure something out whether it was middling, borrowing a few dollars, etc. I had a friend call around noon saying if he was able to grab something, he would stop by and help me out. Hours go by and his truck apparently ""broke down"" and couldn't make it. So I'm bummed at this point.

I message a few more people and someone said they would get a little because I needed help. YES! Turns out, she was helping 2 people with this dope. Not only was she getting me well, but a friend of hers had a really bad day due to her boyfriend beating her and then going to jail. So she was stuck outside with her cat & dog dopesick. And the only way my friend would get her to agree to come with her was to get the dope. 

So, she comes and picks me up and my dude doesn't answer....shit. my main guy and his girl live like 2 blocks away from the new guy. So I call the girl and she's waiting for her bf to get home to grab bth because she only has china which my friend doesn't want (smoker). Says she will call as soon as he gets there to meet us. I'm thinking ""fuck, now I'm not gonna get well and I'm gonna get dropped off"".

So we wait while I'm trying to get a hold of my new guy. The girl ends up calling RIGHT WHEN my friend wants to leave. YES!!! 

So she meets us and I get the dope for my friend (BTH). She happened to be cooking up a speedball when I got in the car. This whole time I'm thinking I'll be able to hit t he foil a couple times and that's it (I shoot). I asked her if I could grab a bit of the china to get well (we're actual childhood friends) and she says sure so I grab it from her purse and open it. She says ""hold on"". She had sucked up her 70-80 units and gives me about 30! 

FUCK YES FOR FRIENDS THAT SELL!!!! 

I end up getting a small bit from my friend as well for going with her to get her friend that had the domestic violence issue earlier today. 

Sorry for the long post, but it turned my day around completely. I just wanted to share my only JJ save.

Cliffnotes: 
Was sick and decided to help a friend for maybe a couple hits. Ended up with a good speedball and a piece for helping a domestic violence victim. ",1516700346.0

HOLY SHIT. These are something else. I just did the first one ever where I used a decent amount of coke and h AND registered perfectly. The rush is definitely *different*, I haven't decided if I like or not . I legit had to focus on not dying for a second (joking... Kind of) and I got this funny feeling... Nausea.(as well as this awesome tingling in my fingers and face?)

I guess my question is, is the nausea common with a soeedball? I have a very decent tolerance and haven't puked from h in a whileeeeeeee.

Please feel free to share your thoughts and any anecdotes you may have (prob not going to sleep for a while, or could pass out at any second I'm not sure which drug will win)

Thanks!

Tl;dr took a soeedball curious if any other experienced user has gotten nauseous as well.

I also didn't puke just really felt like I was about to.

My prescribed dose right now is 320 mg oxycodone extended release and 300 mg oxycodone instant release (yes, I know I could sell those for thousands of dollars each).  

But I need them - I have 7-8 herniated or bulging discs and live my life in sheer agony. The ONLY time I feel even ok are the two hours after I take 3 of my 30 mg instant release oxys. I get no euphoria from the pills or any other positive effect other than pain relief. And that's all I'm looking for here. 

I find myself having come up short on both prescriptions by about a week because of my own stupidity and irresponsibility. If it's being stupid to try to actually fix my f**king pain. My doctor won't prescribe any higher dosage and won't give me any pills early. 

So I'm trying to figure out how to get through the next week without just dying from the pain (and withdrawal). I have some 25 mcg fentanyl patches and might be able to get some 100s. How much, roughly, do you think I'd need to just barely get through a day? Like 150 mcg of fentanyl? More? 

And should I go buy some heroin off the street? I've never done it before, I don't know where to go or what to say to the dealer, or even how much I need. 

ANY help, please, anything at all, is MOST appreciated. I'm utterly desperate. I've put myself in an extremely dire situation, and now I need to know how to figure out how to get through these next 7 days without killing myself from the pain (I won't, really. But it's going to be absolute hell). 

So - how much fentanyl do I need, and should I eat the gel (which I prefer) or smoke it? The actual patch just doesn't work for me, I need a faster and bigger release. 

And should I bother trying to get the fentanyl when I could just go somewhere in my town and buy some heroin? I have money, I can buy what I need, but I'm extremely afraid of getting caught and being put in jail without the drugs I need! Thinking about staying overnight or whatever with nothing - that's truly, truly hell.

What do I say to my soon to be former running partner?,"I'm not quite there yet. I'm getting my photo ID registered this week right after pay day and going in person to register for insurance. I figure by the time I get my ID in the mail, the insurance will be active and I'll be able to get a real prescription for Suboxone.




I still plan to procure dope one last time this week. I'm owed half a bun from Cliff and it ain't coming my way until Friday script day becasue he had to spend all of his money to pay his elecrtic bill after the power got turned off this morning. Which I believe, because it happens a few times a year. I'm planning to buy dope one last time this week, some of it will get loaned to Cliff until script day.


From there I can either count the script as part of my last hurrah or I can trade it with someone else. TBH, I'll inevitably consume the roxies. By that time I'll still have one and a half (12mg total) subs on hand to ensure I don't get sick when I run out. This will also to ensure that I don't feel compelled to buy more dope for lack of subs.

&nbsp;


I'll attempt to get more subs on the street but this pay check is part of the grander plan.


**Phase 1:** Pay fee and register for photo ID at DMV on Friday. Then go to health insurer in person (yeah they have a spot) and try to register for that while waiting for ID to come in the mail.



**Phase 2:** If the insurance is active before I get my photo ID, I'll schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a prescription for subs.


**Phase 3:** Use my new photo ID to pick up my Suboxone script from a real pharmacy.


If my insurance isn't active by my next pay day over two weeks from now, then I'll just spend cold hard cash on the doctor and on the Suboxone script. I'll get a manufacturers coupon to help. By then I'll have my photo ID which is the only major obstacle to gettng subs legally aside from the cost.


Basically, this week should be the last time I buy subs on the street.

&nbsp;


**Now to the question:**

If I ghost on Cliff, he'll eventually begin to persistently try to get in touch with me. He might start with phone calls and texts to my mobile but it won't end there if I don't respond for a couple of days. Early on he'll call my house phone but then he'll ultimately come knocking. 


**When I'm ready to kick because I have a script for subs, I need to tell Cliff something to prevent him from knocking on my front door.**


**What should I say?**

&nbsp;

I ask because I forsee some possible issues. If I say, ""I started seeing a doctor and was prescribed subs."" He'll want me to share some. A couple of months ago when I said I was planning to see a doctor because I Was tired of all the bullshit (spending all of my money on pay day, getting sick because his promises lapsed) he asked me in a worried tone, well practically asserted in a worried tone, ""you are going to share some of those subs when you get them, right?"" 


So you see, if I say that I have a script, he's gonna expect a piece of the action. If the insurance covers the entire cost, I wold still pretend that they cost me a fortune so that I can't be accused of being grimey by not sharing. 

&nbsp;

Perhaps once I have the script locked down I can just honestly tell him, ""I'm out of the game for good and can't share my script because the doctor tests my urine for bupe levels."" I currently cannot predict the outcome of this strategy but I don't think it'll be good if I tell him that I have a script for 30 8mg subs for the month. He knows I never take a full 8mg in any given day. He'll probably say ""I've always shared my roxy srcipt"" but the two free roxies I've recieved every month are payment for me biking to the pharmacy to pick them up. I earned that. Everything else costs me something.

Some of you have seen me on here 99% of you have not. I've been using opiates for almost 5 years on an off usually going on short binges and my longest being a year. I've been clean for 3 or 4 months as far as using daily goes but I use again one time every 2 weeks so I don't go crazy and use Kratom in between that. Friday and Saturday I used and used quite a bit over those 2 days but then I got back on my Kratom taking a higher dose to compensate for any tolerance I gained. Yesterday I was fine but today I feel really sick even with my Kratom. But not like dope sick just like the nausea and diarrhea part of it. And it's like I'm pissing out of my ass for a good 10 seconds at a time. I'm not dehydrated I drink over a gallon of water a day so I have no idea what's wrong. Usually when I do my doses I do it for one day. Could this be the effect of doing a shit ton of my DOC in 2 days rather than 1?or am I just sick from something else.

Been on buprenorphine for the past year, very slowly decreasing my dose. Gone from 4mg to 2mg.

Essentially the side effects are getting to me. Ass shredding constipation, drowsiness, that awful numbness with none of the enjoyment of my past use. Just kinda sick of being addicted tbh. But it was always going to be a long term thing, jumping off completely would pbb be a bad idea, especially at such a relatively high dose. I'm hoping that dropping from 2 to 1mg will help with the annoying effects, give me some sense of control and renew my desire to get off of the stuff, even if I go back to slowly reducing but from 1mg rather than 2.

How long do you think it will take my body to adjust to a new lower dose? I'm guessing weeks rather than days... Could anyone who has done this in my situation tell me how bad it might be? Or am I worrying too much about something that'll be mostly painless?

I'm not too worried about any relapse, I'm confident that I'm over it, for now at least. Maybe I'm being overconfident but I feel sick of opiates in general given my recent feelings about my buprenorphine habit.

Five of us lay strewn about my 1 bedroom flat, in varying states of decay. As rough as I was, I wasn't prepared to waste a Saturday night.

I called my friend S, to phone-browse his supply of illegal substances. As he listed them off one by one, he mentioned he had 'red Thai' magic mushrooms. We agreed a price for 20 grams after some dosage debate with my fellow heathens. This catered to 3.5 grams each, and some left over in case one of us felt frivolous or another joined the masquerade.

8pm rolled by. Mushrooms in hand, 'wish you were here' played eloquently in the background and a crowd of 5 more friends had gathered throughout the day. The five of us who were partaking held our individually wrapped bags of mushrooms in the air as a toast, and began to chow down. A few hours passed with some noticeable change in perception - but nothing comically of value to the non participants- and the other five people left one by one.

Things from here got a little odd.

We all smoked heavily, and were brandishing 40 cigarettes each. My friend C decided to take himself into the bathroom, remove all of his clothing and decide to rearrange all the cigarettes in our packs and place them back wherever he found them - how he obtained them from us, or returned them without clothing from us chain smokers unknowingly I cannot fathom - and returned to the bathroom with his own, mixed up cigarettes.

We began to worry about C and A decided to check on him. A had been working his way through a huge rectangular box containing FIFTY packets of crisps, which he obviously also took the the bathroom. 3 of us remained in the living room watching a big sports event, oblivious to the plot unravelling feet away from us. Until we heard the noise of an electric shaver, and laughter. Manic laughter.

We got up and walked to the bathroom only to find C shaving off A's crisp covered beard while he sat taking a poop on the toilet - both completely naked - with about 60 cigarettes out of the box and scattered around the floor.

We began to laugh at them, but soon the bathroom had taken us too in its grasp.

It made sense they were naked at this point, because the house was ROASTING. So we decanted our flesh covers, because we're all friends - right? We laughed, have each other hair cuts, dished out the last of the drug loot from the night before, back massages were given and had, deep childhood secrets were shared. Heck I think we all had at least one shower.

As the night grew on and the drugs grew more intense, we were lost. Through listening to each others delusions we had convinced each other we were infact, in a hotel. A public bathroom, in a hotel. And right outside the door was the hotel lobby. This paranoia raged through the bathroom and my friend A2 actually cried for a bit. C being the bold cig smuggler decided after much deliberation to open the door, and low and behold we were home. 

The 5 of us, naked as the day we were born resumed the party throughout the house. We drank whiskey and danced to techno, but as the night went on questions arose. ""Are we okay?"" A2 began asking every 5 minutes or so. We comforted him for a while, but began ignoring him because honestly I think we all started slowly to not feel right. 

The stomach pangs began in full force, a few of us threw up and were curled on the floor. Something wasn't right. C decided to do a bit of googling and concluded that the mushrooms we ate were poisonous and we were all actually dying, and not tripping. This spread through the house like wildfire, while A2 went the opposite direction.

4 of us cuddled together on the couch madly googling things and shouting them in each other's ears, A kept dialing the cops then hanging up, M started talking about his family and how he missed them. A2 on the other hand strutted through to the living room, dick swinging in the wind, after having been gone an un-determinable amount of timesmoking a cigarette in one hand while flicking it into his glass of water - then proceeding to drink the glass of water - and announced to us all that he was infact, gay.
                                        
We were far too concerned with our impending doom to really take him seriously, so he took a knife out the drawer and threatened us if we never listened to him. We continued to ignore him and he instead joined in by pacing the house revisiting all his past errors verbally. From playground fights to stolen money he got it ALL out.

We were so panicked we decided we needed help, our bodies were drenched in sweat, we were severely unwell and convinced we were going to die.        

We had all got into my bed -minus A2- at this point, and our friend and drug dealer D somehow got into my house. D and A2 poked their heads into the bedroom and D was actually pretty far gone himself. He let us know he was going to cut lines out of some kind of benzo for us and to come through when we were ready. We all sighed in relief and started to feel safe. We returned to the party now 6 men strong dished out the rest of the mushrooms to D on the house as a thank you and began to snort copious amounts of blue/green unidentified powder D had provided. 

D started making gay jokes at A2 as we recalled the events from earlier, and a good laugh was had by all. Conversations began, and A went back to work on my 50 bags of crisps, C regretted mixing the cigs up because now he couldn't find any he liked. A few of us play fought with D because he was a huge lump of a guy and liked to show off. 

We retreated to the bedroom in the early hours of the morning, lit candles and went full circle to 'wish you were here' playing in the background. We must have passed out for a while.             
                                          
Well we woke up to D full blown, bareback man-fucking A2 in a bed 6 of us shared while jacking off C and spitting on anyone in sight. I was looking at this open-eyed but could barely move, M must have thought this was some kind of dream because he started hysterically laughing. Well D pulled out of A2 and climbed over to M's face and tried to stick his dick in his mouth.
                                            
We all (besides A2) mustered enough sobriety between us to get some punches into D and throw ourselves on top of him. He cried underneath us and seemed to genuinely not know we were upset.

It turns out new gay kid on the block A2 had become convinced while high we were also all gay, and the entire point of the night was to end in a sausage party. He had been secretly seeing the man-giant D for a while and the mammoth man jumped at the chance.",1516810574.0

Also today my dad sends me a photo of a lot of old baggies and wraps I left there when I was 18 (10 years ago), and asked me nicely how my sobriety was doing. Of course I lied and said yeah I'm still 10 months completely clean. Also my baby sister left to another province for uni, and I didn't even say goodbye.

Sorry for any typos or grammar errors in advanced since im texting from my cell because i just sold my laptop so i could cop some dope. I live near a major city with an open air drug trade. Since most if not all of the ""dope"" sold there is fent right now ive developed a fentanyl addiction. 

I know it is because my brother and I use together and he recently had a drug test at a rehab facility before he left and his test only showed positive for fent and carfent.

Ive tried both subs and methadone in my life. I went on subs 5 or 6 years ago when my addiction was only pills. It helped but i relapsed. I was going to a methadone clinic about a year ago but stopped because i was still using on top of my 90mg a day dose and i got a serious side effect of hot flashes and sweating which was killing me. Id dose in the am. Go to work and break out in horrid sweats. It made me so embarrassed. Id get home and just use fent and feel better.

The reason i see no way out currently is because as of today i have no money. My next paycheck is the friday before the super bowl. I have no insurance and make too much money to get medicaid or whatever. My paychecks come and I have work that day so instead of using it to buy insurance or whatever i have to buy drugs.

I dont think suboxone would help a fent addiction. Ive heard and read that suboxone just doesnt make a fent addict feel well. I could try a methadone taper idk.

I guess even more importantly is honestly i enjoy using. Ive used opiates for over 10 years. The longest i went without was about 20 days before my ex gf left me because of it. Everything in my life is ruined so I just live with my parents watch tv and browse the internet while high. 

I guess the only positive is somehow over the course of my addiction ive stayed away from the needle. I only snort. Well anyway. Not sure why Im even posting this. If anyone has any advice on how to take fmla in my situation or if theyve overcome a fent addiction lmk Ty.

My boyfriend of 3 years found heroin in my bag and he’s a drug user himself and has tried heroin once but made me promise to never do it again

That didn’t work out and I started using everyday, sometimes at his house I’d sneak in the bathroom and do some. I was so ashamed of my addiction and how I was lying to him and I also didnt want him trying more and going down this road. Mostly I was just ashamed that I couldnt stop using. I felt like a failure and a disgrace and now I even feel more so. Multiple times he asked me if I was on something because I was itchy and I said “It’s just Kratom”. Once he even told me “If youre using heroin you can tell me I wont be mad, I just care” and I said no. Because Im a fucking moron. And didnt want him finding out and getting pissed and making me throw everything out

Well he looked in my bag today and found heroin. He claims it “fell out of my bag” but I fucking dubt that because it was hidden well in a penic sharpener. I tried telling him it was for my friend and he was yelling calling me a liar and an untrustworthy junkie. He was so angry and said he cant even look at me and just left

Should I just continue with my lie or confess? I feel like if I confess he’ll leave me because I’ve lied so many times over this.

Fuck heroin I’m such a fucking mess. I had to take a day off work and how Im going to get some needles and stuff, I dont IV but I sure as fuck will if he breaks up with me, heroin will already destroy a 3 year relationship with the only man I loved, cant get any worse than this. :( What can i say to make him stay?

And yes I know Im a complete lying idiot, this is the only thing Ive lied to him about but its a big thing. Fuck me.

Update: gonna tell him and hope for the best

Update: inb4 more responses with “naive” and “weak”, I was really not in a good mindset when I wrote that. I would love to write that entire post over again, I won’t be posting on reddit when I am extremely emotionally distressed anymore lol. No, a breakup is not the worst I’ve ever been through, no need to judge people off one reddit post. I have been though a lot of shit due to benzo and alcohol addiction, which I am now sober from, including mental illnesses I have recovered from. It’s not me being naive and overreacting like a teenager, even though I can totally see how cringey that whole post was, I am in treatment for a mental disorder with symptoms of an extreme fear of abandonment and very extreme fluctuating emotions. My initial reaction was to write this sob story paragraph on reddit. I’m pretty embarassed at the entire post I’m probably gonna delete it soon as I got all the answers I wanted, lol.

I can't leave the house til I weigh your bag out cuz I'm not gonna sit in a parking lot with a scale, Baggies and a big bag-o-dope. So now the dboy is gonna be late. Or the junky does answer promptly but 3 mins before dboy pulls in they change their order, wtf.
     Dboy texts they're good and will start meeting people around x:yz o'clock. Junky thinks, cool we're meeting up at x:yz o'clock. No, no, no,  ***note to junky; dboy has more than one customer***  They don't wait around all day just for your call. This also applies to the junky trying to score behind someone's back. You give the dboy no notice, ask to meet in 20 minutes and the dboy says he'll try. Don't be surprised when they show up late.
     Then there's the junky that does their wake up fix the night before then starts texting the dboy first thing in the morning, when they finally text back around noon (if ur lucky) and say they're just getting up, the junky responds, ""cool can u meet in 20, I've been sick all day."" ***Hell no*** just cuz you've been waiting all morning and sick doesn't mean I'm gonna rush getting ready, skip my morning shot to hurry and meet you and run the risk of getting arrested before I've done my get well.

My habit is out of control. It's not as bad as some of you all, but the amount of money I've spent, the unholy things I've done to obtain my drugs... It's sickening.

I was full-on junkie behavior today. Laid around all morning til I got the call then jumped up looking like a ratchet unshowered wreck and ran out the door lying my ass off, pulling money from several places including sketch store returns, couldn't even make it home to use and found myself staring at myself in the disgusting bathroom mirror hating every second of it all. Actually I went to 2 different gas station bathrooms because I couldn't get all the pills to dissolve in the syringe at the first one (boofing) so I had a shit-covered syringe ""that I needed for my kids medicine"" in my pocket for a bit. 

The pinnacle was sitting in the parking lot with my $70 in hand, wearing a shirt for a company I used to work for waiting for my drugs and thinking how shitty that would make my mugshot (think prestigious job.... In the medical field.... working with addicts smh). They shorted me and they've ripped me off before and I went back because I'm fucking stupid and I was in withdrawal.

To wait all day to do my shitty drugs that was half of what I paid for, and I'm already almost out 4 hours later... Man its just depressing. I hate carrying this weight around. It's like I put on a backpack full of bricks every day and it makes every part of my life more difficult than it has to be. It hurts, and I somehow convince myself that I HAVE to do it. I NEED these little pills to keep going. 

Anyway this one time really pissed me off because I've got something really REALLY good about to happen in my life in less than a fucking week--I've been waiting for this for over 3 years.., and if anything had gone wrong all of that would have been ruined. My life would have done a 180 right down the shitter. A nose dive.

Thankfully nothing bad happened (minus the usual getting ripped off and prolly laughed at for their double come up). I know this is a shit post I'm just really scared of fucking my life up, scared of being sober.

I have used opiates in pill form most of my life but only for health issues. I will be honest with y’all and say yes there were a few times I took an extra one just to get a little buzz if I was out with friends or something. 

I’ve been getting kidney stones since I was 10 anyone who’s had them will say that’s awful fucking pain so I’ll get prescribed something for a short amount of time and that’s it. I’m also prone to ovarian cysts and same story with that one. 

Recently (started over a year ago but not much over) I’ve been having this headache that I can not describe to you, when i first got it I woke up thinking someone had broken into my home and beat me with a bat. My pcp prescribed me norco for the pain and it helped ALOT. I would run out early cause sometimes I needed more than one. 

I moved States and unfortunately this state has a big narcotics issue and I’m young so they think I’m a drug seeker all the time. I suppose I am in a way but it’s really not for fun. In May I went to the ER with my head pain causing vision problems and leaving me screaming in agony. They did a spinal tap and sent me home saying I was a drug seeker and they don’t want to help me. 

That same night I woke up after knocking out with the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life, kidney stones, broken bones, cysts, labor etc NOTHING could touch this pain holy shit I could cry just thinking about it. Turns out they let out too much spinal fluid. I spent the next 10 Days in the hospital getting dilaudid and norco every couple of hours. Once I could finally go to the bathroom on my own without crying I got sent home with NO medication. Total bullshit. 

So anyways. That head pain came and went every other week or so I’d have an attack. October I got kidney stones. I went to the ER every couple of days to get pain relief and they’d only send me home with a couple days worth so that’s why I kept going back until I finally saw a specialist who said I shouldn’t be in as much pain as I’m claiming like wtf?? Are YOU the one feeling it?! 

This led me to asking my mom for some of her pain meds or buying some of my friends script. Since end of November though the head pain has started to worsen. It was now weekly almost every other day. I finally got a new pcp last month. 

She gave me Tylenol 4 not exactly what I wanted but honestly I was grateful for it anyways. I called her and let her know I ran out about 4 Days early. I told her up front I’d be honest with her but since the head pain was now daily as of 3 weeks ago I had no choice. She said she would not refill until after I get some testing done. Here’s the thing. Making appointments out here for literally anything takes fucking weeks. It took 5 weeks just to see a urologist. 

I want to add as well that I have told her I try EVERYTHING before I reach for a pain pill. I always go for excedrin/ibuprofen first, a hot shower beating onto my head, massage, I’ve even put icy hot onto my scalp looking for relief. This head pain is ruining my life. 

I don’t know how to make her see that I’m desperate but not really an active drug seeker I just need relief so I can live my life. I love my life it’s excellent and seems to only be getting better but this pain (and occasional kidney/flank pain) are debilitating. They’re ruining my life. I’ve been passed over for pain management but they’re still trying to get me an appointment which I appreciate. 

Someone please tell me what to say to make her understand that if I don’t get help in reliving this pain I might just end it. It sounds super fucking dramatic but it’s the damn truth it hurts so bad. I even tried calling my dr in my old state to see if she could help me but I got nothing. I’m at a complete loss. The appointment is tomorrow I don’t want to go in crying and begging for help but I NEED her to understand that until the mri/blood work and all that stuff comes back with what’s causing this and then they can figure out a treatment plan then I’m all for that! But right this very second I’m sorry I need pain pills. 

I’m very close to losing an AMAZING job I have because I’ve missed so much work for illness. I don’t smoke or drink or take anything illegal (other than buying scripts from friends which is technically illegal I know) 

Any advice please just give me a good way to word it to her that I am desperate but without coming off like “I’m addicted and I wanna take all of these pills at once” I’m at my wits end. ",1516776101.0

I ruined my ex-girlfriend's life. I am a 18 year old girl just finishing up high school. Lately I've been feeling very responsible for the downward-spiral I've thrown my ex into. Her and I started hanging out a year and a half ago. I'd basically live at her house on the weekends and we'd have parties. We both had never touched a drug before in our lives and I wanted to try something. She hesitantly agree to do something with me. I ended up stealing a whole bottle of oxy from my parents and we tried it that weekend. We both fell in love with it and soon after we fell in love with eachother too. We developed a habit and soon enough the bottle was empty, so we moved on to something else. When that would go dry, we'd keep moving until there was nothing else to do. School became a blur, withdrawals were worse for her because of the depression. She ended up in an impatient facility where she met someone new. Someone with better drugs, she was never in love with me. She left the impatient a week later and left me in the dark. I submerged myself in anything that would give me a chance to forget. A month went by without me noticing, she called me from the hospital. She was crying, telling me she missed me, saying she had overdosed the night before. I went crawling back to her but she continued to see the girl she was dating at the time. When I saw her again, she had completely changed. Her eyes were cold, her voice was harsh. She was pale and held a constant dark presence. I had lost her completely. Now a year and a half later, I haven't heard from or seen her since. She hasn't asked about me. She had so many dreams and I feel like I ruined her. I did ruin her. 

I miss her warmth. ",1516771532.0

I've never used a needle in my life, but I have a long history with opiates - coming up on eight years since my car accident (therefore pain meds). Tramadol, Nucynta, oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin, tea, fent. 

I was clean from heroin for a while recently, using suboxone. I relapsed right around new years and have used pretty much daily since. My new location has beans instead of glassine baggies like I was used to in NY. 

Anyway, today my boyfriend and our friend went down to the city to get our shit. All was well but he got a little too high. Id been taking care of him, but then decided Id do a bean and a half. 

So i go downstairs to take care of him, remember nothing after. I collapsed onto the floor and wasnt breathing. My bf gace me mouth to mourh while waiting for the paramedics (no cops came).

He made up a story that i still take tramadol and told them it was a mini seizure and the reason the narcan brought me back is tramadol being and opiate.

Following 4 weeks of medically supervised detox stabilization, there was no advantage in prolonging suboxone use (7 days vs 28 days taper). The 7 day taper participants had a greater rate of opioid free urine specimens than those who had a 28 day taper. This was a sample of over 500 randomly assigned participants so quite representative.^1,2

Initial suboxone doses ranged from 2-8 mg on the first day in another study. Doses were mainly stable for up to 24 months averaging 10-24 mg per day (notice higher than induction). 75% of patients continued medication assisted therapy, tapered off it, or started methadone maintenance or inpatient therapy. 21% tapered from suboxone though no follow-up on their success with abstinence was conducted.^3


Abstinence may be maintained with a brief and intensive suboxone taper, followed by use of naltrexone. While the study had small samples, abstinence was greater in a 4 week versus 2 or 1 week taper condition (after stabilization). While 63% of individuals were abstinent after 4 weeks of tapering, 29% of individuals were also abstinent after 2 and 1 week tapers (non-trivial). While these results contradict the previous study, results were no different at 1 and 3 month follow ups (aka the same number of people were clean or not clean). There were other differences in treatment conditions as well.^4

In youths age 16-24 a 56 day taper was superior to a 28 taper in producing opioid negative urinalysis. ^5

Patients had a better likelihood of transitioning off opiates when in a 30 day rather than 5 day suboxone treatment program.^6


In summary, we don't really know much about ""long term"" (beyond 30 days) suboxone treatment but we do know that anywhere between 7-30 days can be effective in reducing opioid use. Several studies use counseling in conjunction with suboxone. 

To me it seems with the right support, there is no reason to be on suboxone for months or years at a time - though 'with the right support' is saying a lot. I'd love to hear people's thoughts about long and short term suboxone treatment.

And how bad of an idea is it to visit him or send him money?","*This is a throw away account for obvious reasons*

Ugh, I gotta pour one out for the homie big time... My dealer is in jail. Long story short he was headed over to my house to do a trade, some norco 10s and some xanax for some fire black, not that it really matters, but he never showed up and never got back to me... for days. He never took days to get back to me. 

Well, I mentioned it to another client of his that I had just met and become friends with. Ironically, he's in jail too right now, for the dumbest reason possible; failing a SCHEDULED piss test. He'll be in for another month but that's doable. Anyways, she looked up his first and last online and, well, he got caught.

Now, I know what he had on him for the most part. A scale of course, a ton of needles, baggies (most likely at least 50), at least one prebagged measurements of black but most likely more, and anywhere from 3 to 14 grams of black on him. I bet he had some suboxone and either some Xanax, kpins, or both. I think this is his first major offense. I know he's been to jail for minor things before but I don't remember if he had gotten caught up for heroin before.

Anyways, my dealer was a great, great guy. He delivered usually with no charge, he was almost always on time (dealer time, but still, if he said 15 minutes it always meant no less than 45) and over time we started to hang out. Hell, I would loan him money sometimes and he always got me back with interest. He helped me find junkie chicks and all around was a great guy. 

I miss him already and I know hes sicker than a dog right now in that cold, lonely jail cell :'(

TL;DR how much time do you think getting pulled over in a car with a scale, baggies, possibly several prebagged doses of dope, some kpins and 3-12 grams of dope will being if its his first offense? ",1516755815.0

When I got out in November I only used Kratom and lope for my cravings until I gave in and relapsed two or three times using opana for only 2 or 3 days each time a couple months ago I'm currently on community control (probation)  other than that I've only been using Kratom to satisfy my cravings and keep myself from tearing my hair out due to cravings and not being able to get anything done due to anxiety and general dysphoria. While I was in jail suboxone was pretty prevalent there and I remember taking an 1/8th or less of an 8mg strip and snorting it, and getting incredible euphoria. My cravings were non existent during those times. I only used suboxone 3 times while in jail. 

I just got on suboxone last week and decided to keep snorting it and i'm taking under my prescribed dosage which is 4mg twice daily instead I'm taking 2mg a day because I've read less is more. I'm just not getting that magic I got when taking it in jail. Could the kratom have affected my tolerance? I'm curious how to make it better for me so I can get some euphoria or a small buzz when I dose.

I had been on day 2 of opiate WD and was feeling like complete rats titties and I hit up the very few people I've met in this city since I have moved here.

Unfortunately, the strongest opiate I could find was fucking hydro 10s and they wanted $6 a piece for them... No thanks. Especially because they wouldn't even alleviate any of my WD symptoms.

About 9-10 o'clock that evening, I get a text from a friend that says he thinks he can score some H. Well I head over and get to his place. He tells me that the dude he thinks he can score from doesn't have an active phone, but does just show up randomly at times.

30 minutes pass and low and behold, he shows up! Fuck yeah! I throw dude 40 to get me a half of some tar and promise to break him off some... I'm generous and an all around nice guy. Well he has to drive 1 hour away to get it... FUCK. 

Me and my friend end up just chillin and watching TV, while I'm holding in my bowels and trying not to explode like a volcano. Time seems to be standing still as I can hear my wrist watch tick....tick.....tick. Well he finally knocks on the door after a lengthy 2 1/2 hour trip.

""I have some bad news, guys"" he says. My stomach drops even lower and gets even tighter than it has been for the past two days. ""I got ripped off. The guy sold me molasses"". At this point I am FUMING and KNEW I should have gone with this guy to pick up the fucking dope. I am trying not to explode physically and emotionally at this point as I say ""it's all good dude. It happens to the best of us"" with as much sarcasm as I can inflict upon that sentence.

He splits after my friend gives him a quick chat. Now I am just sitting on the couch, incredibly pissed off beyond belief that I let my fucking money walk. I had so much faith in the situation that I made a rookie mistake.

My friend and I then decide to chill in his bedroom. I go to the bathroom to release my bowels for what seems like the 30th time that day. When I get finished and walk back into the room, I see my friend with two syringes, filled with clear liquid, and he has the biggest shit eating grin on his face.

""Yo dude, you wanna do a shot?"" I look at him like he just grew a head out of the side of his neck. ""what the fuck is in there dude?"" I say in an intereste manner as the only thing I've ever seen mix up clear is coke (which I knew he didn't do), Fentanyl, and ice.

""It's Ice dude. You wanna try some?"" he says, still with that huge fucking smile. Now I LOVE opiates and would choose them over ANY drug if it were available, but they weren't and I wasn't about to say no and not do some and look like a bitch! (great reasoning, right?)

He tosses over the needle and I tie off. He tells me to he careful as it's a quarter gram shot. He also tells me to push the plunger down slow because it can burn and to make sure it's registered because missing with meth can cause some nasty infections.

I hit first try, push down the plunger, take off the tourniquet, and before I can even pull the empty rig out of my arm, this fucking WAVE of heat comes over my body. I first feel it in my ears, then my taint, and then in my chest. Oh God the fucking feeling I got in my chest. It was like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson round housed me right in the sternum and knocked the wind out of me. Then came the dilated pupils. I swear everything got brighter and more vivid and could feel my pupils dilate.

""So, how do you feel Dickstomp?!"" he says excitedly. ""Dude, I never expected it to be like this. I think I may have found a new favorite"" I say, still not believing that I would have EVER switched from a downer to a stimulant. Not to mention, this was my first time ever doing meth and I IVed what most people smoke throughout the day.

The night carries on with me talking my jaw off, constantly pissing, going back to talking and conspiring, and before I know it, it's morning time. I didn't even feel sick anymore and since I had done that shot, I didn't even THINK of being dope sick. Here I am, 3 days into opiate wd and I feel fantastic.

The following weeks are filled with binging, jacking off for hours on end, binging more, bouts of drug induced psychosis, and a whole new addiction in hand....but hey! I quit opiates which is good, right?..... RIGHT?!


Honestly, I feel like meth is an easier drug addiction to handle. I currently use ice practically every day now, but only shoot about a point or maybe two if its a normal day and when I binge, I do tend to shoot about .4-.5 if I'm feeling froggy. Also since using meth, I have not touched an opiate the whole time. I also have had multiple stints of sobriety, with my longest being 7 days.

The only negative side effects from the meth for me are of course loss of appetite, dehydration (I try to drink as much water as possible), seeing and hearing things that sometimes aren't there (shadow people and some noises that startle me), and the worst one is probably just the ""on edge"" feeling I have but I have generalized anxiety so that feeling of impending doom is always there.

Fortunately with the aid of my psych meds, if things get a little TOO smacked, twacked, and gacked, I can pop my meds and be knocked out within 30 minutes so sleep deprivation is never a problem unless I forcefully keep myself awake.

If you read this, bless you because I tend to ramble and my story telling abilities are sub-par, even when I'm sober like I currently am.

I still frequent this sub as the stim and meth subreddit tend to get a little...colorful at times. Hope my opiate family is doing well and everyone has been safe!

Remember to practice harm reduction, do test shots of new shit, and say your prayers to JJ if you are sick!

Much love, family.

TL;DR - Day two of opiate wd, IVed meth, forgot I was sick, fell in love with Tina, now a meth addict but I am sober from opiates.",1516748896.0
