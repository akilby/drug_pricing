I really like my new group of friends and I don't want to lose them.

Also I don't want to tell them because I want to use again. I don't know why but I just keep getting drawn back to thinking about shooting up. It's like I don't want to use but I still would shoot up without a second thought.

I'm on vivitrol too. I know that I could probably use and get high when I'm at the end of the 28 day cycle, but I really wanna get off it so I can get high whenever. But then again, at the same time it's good that I am on vivitrol so I don't use.

I've got some pills that weigh a total of 300mg, 200mg of that is Morphine. I don't want to go through the steps of extracting it since I'll loose a lot of the actives due to the gel matrix when in contact with pure water. No matrix in 90% alcohol but I don't know if it's suitable for extracting still. Need to read a bit more about that topic before I can find a method.

I've heard Morphine is one step away from H. All you need is Acetic Acid. 

Since I'm assuming most H is already below 2/3 of the weight in potency, the binders wouldn't leave much dead weight. Would it basially turn into H if I ''shaked'' it up with Acetic Acid? Leaving me with a more euphoric, potent and smokeable substance? What about yield?

I pretty sure you can still find dope at Lexington and 125th street. And he just does a good job at describing going and getting dope. 


Anyways, I curious what other tunes you guys know and think about. [Hurt](https://youtu.be/kPz21cDK7dg) is one of my favorite drug addiction songs. Although I hate the johnny cash version primarily because he changes one line. Trent reznor wrote ""I wear this crown of shit upon my liars chair full of broken thoughts I can not repair."" And old johnny cash change it to ""I wear this crown of thorns."" I don't know. Wearing a crown of thorns makes me think of Jesus or a martyr or something. Instead, wearing a crown of shit is probably a better description for being strung out and hurting everyone around you. oh and [mr self destruct](https://youtu.be/Ce3xOgg9mtk) has fucking excellent lyrics too. ""I am the needle in the vein. I am the high you can maintain and I am the pusher, I am the whore, I am the need in you for more. I am the bullet in the gun! I am the truth from which you run! I am the silencing machine! I am the end of all your dreams."" That shit is heavy.



Oh Elliott smith got some good tunes. I love [memory lane](https://youtu.be/G9WjYgsygik) and [kings crossing](ttps://youtu.be/3D7vRObaTyo). 


Anyways, I'm rambling. I got on methadone recently and have not done dope in like 5 days which I'm really happy about. I can dose in about 38 minutes. I relapsed after about 2 years of not using heroin. Anyways, instead of using heroin for the last few days I have just done a lot of coke and crack. Mostly crack cause that's what is around. And it's fucking killing my veins. Being a long long time heroin addict. Part of me is super addicted and loves the needle.

Not completely sure thr action in which tobacco cause a stronger but i'm lead to believe that it has something to do with the subtle MAOI properties of the plant.

What if you place some subdermal nicotine patches on your skin around 25-30 minutes before taking opiates, I know that when my cigarette's 3/4th of the way finished, I am nodding pretty hard.

 [So would it be safe to assume that with the correct dose of nicotine (pretty high) that it could give a stronger/*stable* constant nodding effect that could otherwise be achieved by smoking tobacco?]

 I would assume nobody has done this yet, so I'm think that i'm going to give it a shot tomorrow to test my hypothesis.

Learned a harsh truth.,"You know...if it wasnt heroin it was suboxone.  Since opiates ended up in my life I just have never stopped for a long period of time.  Even when i was doing my suboxone the right way it was still an opiate crutch i had t rely on.  I met people from all walks of life in there and i realized addiction isnt something one can be arrogant and cocky about getting over.  

According to what i learned in group the average is 7 rehabs before a heroin addict gets clean or dies.  Ive done an iop sober living program. A 5 day mental health rapid detox and now a 7-11 day detox/rehab thing.  I stayed 11 days.  So lets go ahead and say i have three of my seven.  

The harsh reality for addicts who want to get better is that life is nothing but putting as much sober time in as you can until the inevitable happens.  I had a year and a half off heroin  with subs. Hopefully this time will be a bit longer and i wont fuck my life up as bad.  Idk what it is about maintaining long term sobriety thats so difficult. It could be later on down the line i only remember the high but not the life that comes with it.  It could be that I really never wanted it bad enough.  Maybe ill be in my head to much.

I feel like i maybe be destined to get sober then relapse infinitely until the day i die.  I know this though and Ill live my life on my terms and live with my choices.  It could be tomorrow it could be 10 years from now the next time i get high.

then put that into a very small medkit for bandaids, hand santizier, etc. http://imgur.com/a/2Ybm9

then put that into a small clear bag with my toiletry.  

**I have two options and would love to get some advise on how to not get it taken away from any authority (TSA, Airport check, Cruise check, etc.):**

1. Keep the toiletry on me in my carry on backpack with my laptop so I know its with me, I just don't know if I will get checked. I am a 26 y/o with a beard and don't have the most innocent looking appearance to me. Also passport needed to be renewed like last week to get visas so Idk if that will raise any flags.

2. Put it in my parent's second luggage where they are keeping their medications/ and random stuff that didn't fit in their main luggage. The only issue that I'm a little nervous about with this is it will be a checked bag. I'm either 1. afraid checked bags get a little more search-time from what I've gathered. 2. The luggage gets lost and I'm fucked. With my luck, it could happen... and I really feel like I need these to function or I feel on edge or literally panicky the entire time so I can't imagine going on for a long period without it (I've been taking them for over 2-3 years now, low dosage .50 daily).

**Can someone help me with some advice? I'm flying to Asia so idk how strict their rules are about unprescribed medication, especially xanax/controlled substance.**

**Update**: I was able to get my doctor to prescribe me xanax and will pick them up tonight. My only question is I want to bring what I have as it's stronger than what I've been prescribed.

Should I just add what I have to the bottle? 
i'm not sure what to do to make sure i can get by without issues.. maybe replace what she gave me with what I have?

I understand if I snorted some Heroin and took a urine drug test the next day, chances are I'd test positive for opiates, right? Now, assuming I just placed some powder heroin into some water and put the dipstick in there to test for the drug, will it just show invalid or do you think it will actually show positive for opiates? 

The reason I ask is because my friend gave me powder saying it was H. It kind of came in a tiny rock but when I broke it up, it broke up funny and not into straight powder. It was also a few different colors, not like blended it but like a brown spot here or there within the whiteness. I tried snorting a bit of it but didn't feel anything and questioned the authenticity of it. I am pretty sure it's fake but wanted to make sure. I have a drug test kit at home which tests for opiates. Do you think it will work if I put this substance in water and put the dip stick in there and see if it shows positive? Or do you think it will show invalid because it is not a urine sample? (The reason I don't use my own urine is because I already have H in my system)

My man and our friend like to shoot, I'm more of a smoker. Anyway a friend just got out of treatment, only to go back to the needle. The boys start shooting and I smoke a bit then decide to got walk the dogs. I'm gone for no more than 10 minutes, walk into my room to my boy yelling to keep the dogs out and my friend on the floor. My guy then frantically tells me that our friend is OD'ing. This is one of the scariest things I have been a part of. Somehow I manage to go into nurse mode and attend to my friend (my guy is a little more on the frantic side). We check his vitals, shallow breathing, pin-point pupils, not responding to heavy shaking or voice. Thank the high heavens we had Narcan nasal spray, we get that baby up his nose. As I remain with our buddy my man begins to look for a phone to call 911. I notice his breathing has stopped and I pull out from my memory of middle school CPR and begin to perform it. Boy finally finds a phone and begins to dial, right as he hits send our friend gasps full of air and opens his eyes! FUCKING HALLELUJAH! We then hang up because he says he doesn't want to go. After about 10 minutes of him coming to his senses hes a coherent guy able to function. This was the first time I have seen an OD. Quite a trip... never wanna experience that again. He, WE, are so lucky. 
I just wanted to share this to get it off my chest with some strangers. Share my lessons learned.
1. DON'T hesitate to call 911. Save a fucking life, don't worry about getting popped for having drugs or shit like that... hint there is a law out there called Good Samaritan Laws.
2. Have some Narcan on hand. I only had one but I realized how handy it is and you never know when you might need it!
3. Learn CPR. I read that administering CPR to an overdose victim reduces the chances of them needing to be hospitalized after recovery.

Hope my lessons learned help someone else out there. Also if anyone else has tips or would like to share experiences, please do so. We have a shitty disease and its tough fighting it, but you don't have to go through it alone.",1487644574.0

So as you all know opiates are **expensive**; so I've been searching for something that'll give me a good bang for my buck, last a long time (longer than oxycodone) and be pretty euphoric. Well last night I figured I'd found my solution: Opana (oxymorphone)! I went ahead and ordered myself two Opana K71 IR 10mg pills, thinking I'd crush them up and be able to snort them. I figured 20mg of Opana would last me a while given i have NO tolerance. (15 - 20mg of oxy and 30mg of hydrocodone are great for me). 

Now that I've woken up and sort of sobered up a bit, I realize I probably made a huge mistake. I think these are going to be far too potent for me. When I ordered I was thinking of doing a 1mg bump, and making one pill last for 10 times, but now I think I may just be in over my head. What's your advice? Wouldn't Opana's since they're so strong also possibly jack up my tolerance (which would be bad)? 

I've had 1mg and 3mg bumps of IV Dilaudid in the hospital before, that's my only experience with opioids this strong.

As I already have a preexisting disability, my doctors waited roughly a year beefore doing another surgery as I am not ambulatory. However, as I can still feel everything, as I'm not paralyzed, it makes me slightly concerned, as I've now been on painkillers since last January due to the intense pain, and when the pharmacy took a week to refill a dose roughly 2 weeks before my hip replacement (i'd explain why they opted for hip replacement for dislocation of a hip, but it's a long story, and I don't want to go into details as someone might figure out who I am). I had pretty bad withdraw symptoms...The surgery had to wait nearly 9 months because due do my anomaly of being alive, I was then diagnosed with Addison's disease and lost over 50 pounds after the back surgery, and I'm only just 18 (January 17th was my birthday), so they freaked the fuck out, and had to put out fixing my hip problem that long. Another thing I'd like to add is that I have DMD...I'm worried I'm going to become addicted...why the fuck can't they make medical marijuana legal where I live? I recently completed the surgery, so it's not like I don't have access to medication, but I'm just worried even though everything that could cause me pain has been fixed, I might get opiod induced hyperglesia or something, and given the fact I have a (currently) terminal disease, I'm legitimately a little scared. I know this might seem incredibly far fetched, but I can assure I really do have 2 incredibly rare diseases, so yeah, if you don't believe me, don't bother posting. Is there anything I could do to make sure i avoid any kind of addiction? I don't want to end up an addict. I know this place is generally for people who are addicted and want to be careful and safe, or people trying to recover, but I figure some people here might know how to stop a very possible problem? Or have I just been indoctrinated by the shittiness of D.A.R.E in our garbage public education? I have honest concerns. I'm not quite sure I'll ever be pain free just on the basis of what DMD does to people...pertaining to what I said about medical marijuana, that'd be a fucking useful thing to be legalized in my state, but whatever.

I have 10+ years doing dope so I know what works for me and what doesn't. Anyway, I have a bunch of 8mg sub strips to help me off the dope but I like to use xanax to help sleep and take the edge off.

So this morning I call my dope guy set it up and then i was going to the open air market to get my xanax all before I had to be at work to open. I have done this trip plenty of times and know exactly how long it takes and how much time I can spare.

I get into town and call my dope connect, and he has his fam meet me, which is a dude who I have been trying to get a hold of for months because I lost his number. he is great, and he is quick and on time just like I need this morning. I get half a bundle and his new phone number. The half bundle will last all day and I plan on getting on the subs tomorrow and use xanax.

Now it's about a 15 minute ride to the market place and traffic is light because of the holiday weekend. I get to the spot I usually park at, and find a spot quickly. I think to myself things are just going to well this morning and I need to watch out.

So i park and I only have to walk a few blocks before I find someone with the bars that I need. BUT, I get out and go to lock the doors and my remote is not on my keychain on my belt loop. I just got a new luxury sport SUV that uses an intelligent keyless system. All I have to do is have that remote in my pocket and the car ill start. BUT IT""S NOT THERE. I go into panic mode because if I lost it at the ATM or the coffee place I went to that morning my car wouldn't start....I get back in and the car starts, that means they are lost somewhere inside the car.

Ok, I figure they can't be far so I start searching under seat, between seat etc. But this is not exactly the type of neighborhood where a rather clean cut white boy needs to be pulling apart his expensive SUV. there were already undesirables gathering around asking if I had any extra change. I just needed to find that remote so I could get walking and find some xanax. 

Time was running out and I spent 15 minutes trying to find this god damn remote. I couldn't just leave my car there unlocked and go looking for bars so I had to abandon the mission. It sucked because I ran out of time, I had to get to work or I would be late and that would be bad news. So no bars for me today. When I got to work and I had a minute and was able to look without being panicked I found that little remote bastard under the seat hidden behind some electronic thing a majig.

Complete bartard move and I wasn't on any bars....at least I had half a bundle of dope to get me through the day. I guess I should have just slowed down, taken my time and looked harder without being in panic mode I would have some bars now.",1487625895.0

I go around the day they moved in to do some of the heavy work. While there I notice the older lady unpacking her things, one box I noticed was FULL of meds. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and more and more and more boxes of fentanyl patches along side a plethora of other medicine. I wanted them and I knew I would take them at some point. It was just to risky right now. Still I stored that information in my mind for future use.




About a month goes by and I'm visiting my grandma having dinner. Who walks I no other than our old friends fentanyl hoarders. So they sit down I make them all coffee and start thinking on how I could do this. I excuse myself to use the toilet, whilst in he hall way I purposely rub past his coat and keys jingle... I slowly reach in the pocket and take his keys out. I return into the kitchen and ask if anybody would like anything from the store.




Once I leave the front door I fucking bolt, I was running as much as I could. It turned into a jog and then a quick walk. A 15 minute walk took me about 4 minutes and I was there. I let myself in cautiously with the stolen keys and make my way to the bathroom, nothing. I move on to the bedrooms upstairs. As soon as I walk into the master bedroom I see it there on the floor. A big clear storage box of medicine. I proceeded to take out all but 3 boxes of patches. So now I have a carrier bag with around 15 Sandoz boxes all full 5 in each. All 75 mcg/h Jackpot. I get out of the house and lock up walk around the corner and bolt immediately. I got back to grandmas home and quietly place the keys in the same pocket they were took from. I was never caught, asked about it, I never headed another thing about it.





Second scenario isn't as long winded as that, I had some crazy Dboy who was just plain odd in every way. I ended up giving that dude a handjob for a gram. 

Yes I know I broke laws, yes I know I stole from family friends, yes I know I was in the wrong and a complete scum bag.




TL;DR - stole fent patches from old friends of family and gave a guy a handy for dope.",1487623749.0

I made this profile out of frustration and being unsure, just need to vent I guess. I had posted this earlier but I had said something I guess I wasn't supposed to in the title so I had to delete it. About a decade ago I sustained a compression-force injury to my SI joint and lower L# spine that healed into herniated discs and loss of cartilage with bone-bone contact. I walk with a cane most of the time now because of it. 

I was prescribed the usual pills for this type of pain, generic Percocet- ""oxycocet"" and they work. Then my doctor retired. My files got transferred to my new doctor who was recommended to me, and who agreed to continue the plan of action my previous doctor had set out. Until about 3 weeks ago. 

Knowing my pretty lengthy medical history he knows exactly what I've tried in respect to medicines but his new plan is to just remove all narcotic painkillers from his repertoire, practice-wide. Not wean, remove. I've been taking this medicine for nearly a decade and instead of talking to me about a change of pain maintenance, his plan was to stop them and not even contact me. The pharmacy called and informed me of his order. 

The pharmacist and I spoke about whether this is due to a legislation change but they assured me that no change in legislation has happened that would explain this. They explained that some doctors decide to stop narcotic pain relief therapy if the patient breaks their narcotic medicine contracts, or has a history of doctor-shopping or asking for their mess early. I have done none of that. Why would I want to screw up the one thing I've found that works for me? 

Now, being Canadian I know I can go to the pharmacy and buy Tylenol with codeine, but I also know that the amount of them I would need to take would kill me inside of a week from my liver turning to stone. I've read up about CWE but the caffeine in them makes it a terrible idea. If my dog knew somebody than I'm sure he would buy but he doesn't know anybody. He has never bought from an ""alternative vendor"" before and doesn't know how to do that, either. 

The doctor had absolutely no intention of weaning to avoid the withdrawals either. So here I am, after nearly ten years of taking my life-saving medicine daily, now a bucket of sweat and vomit and no vision of the future. 

I'm sorry to sound sorry for myself, I just didn't know what else to do and really needed to get this off my back. I'm just terrified and thought maybe somebody else could relate. I don't know. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this. ",1487607812.0

Do you legalize heroin? That concept sounds crazy to a lot of people but I think it should be legal, I honestly believe it would be better overall for the country and give addicts much less fear of law enforcement and be more likely to seek help

If you would like to argue with me about why heroin shouldn't be legal id be interested to hear but think about this:

Heroin is more powerful than you and me. Well, opiates are, but heroin is the cheapest and the drug of choice for many opiate users. Heroin will ALWAYS be here, you get rid of one gang and another one shows up 

You have the combination of people like me who are in the dope game just to sell it and make money (formerly yours truly) AND addicts who love opiates/dope and would give anything in the world to get high one more time. Dope is a culture and it spreads and multiplies everyday. It's kind of sick but it seems like we can't stop it

I felt so good selling dope to my homies I grew up with but it seems kind of sick sometimes 😐 Yet at the same time what are we to do? America has been infected with opiates and it's just spreading like a virus

We helped each other out when we could in the mean times.  It was working, ya know, a decent running mate.  But ultimately the dudes a piece of shit, junkie for last 5 or 6 years, freeloading off his o-so-generous enabling ass mother. Running her into the ground as fast as he could.


So I'd like to think I'm a functional junkie, I live alone, pay rent, got bills I sometimes pay.  And this dudes just scheming all day, and after running with him for awhile I start hearing and figuring out he owes everyone money and it's only getting worse. 
 

So, naturally I begin to distance myself, am less willing to help him out, won't throw down on as many bags and just tell him I'm slowing down and or I'm busy.  


Then one day I'm stoned out of my mind, he calls so I go to hang out.  I get over there and he just starts in.  That he's sick blah blah. And I'm thinking it's a good thing you never said this on the phone or if have never come.  So he's got me, and I toss him about a half gram to shut him up and he promises he'll get me back when his mom gets paid.... has done it a handful of times always been good. But I knew this time was going to be trouble.  But it's too late.  I'm there, I'm holding. 


So sure enough he burned me, his mom got into a car accident the day he is supposed to pay me back, so he can't get her card to pay me back.  This was about 2 months ago now.  Every week an excuse.  Every day something new... But I want my money and if I can't get it I'll make him pay one way or another.

So I let it be known I was getting a decent check for tax return just to listen to him squirm and lie and see how he reacts.  I'm sending him dope porn shots, telling him to come over knowing he has no way, which even if he did he can't get into my complex unless someone lets him in... I entertain the ideas of letting him borrow more money just to ruin his day when I tell him something came up.  But everyday he is texting me and calling me, with the same stupid thought that I will help him out even when I have told him I will never do another thing for him again until he pays me back.

Now, before I had a dope habit, I had messed around with habits on fentanyls (mostly butyr) and U-47700. Withdrawals are infamously intense, but short. Usually after 2 days you're feeling quite a bit better.

So, now this seems obvious to me, but I never see it mentioned -- wouldn't these drugs (maybe hydromorphone as well for similar reasons) serve a purpose to people getting off opiates then? Has anyone tried this?

Instead of riding out a heavy week long withdrawal from some other drug, is it not viable to instead switch to a short acting opioid for a week, get the other drug out of your system, and then stop usage, going through a significantly shorter withdrawal from the short half-life drug instead?

the friend that introduced me had to move to another state. no one else knows at all i do oxy everyday. no other friends or family. so we decided wed both try and get clean and started taking subs. it was fine at first but definitely easier with help. an ex of 5 years of mine and me became great friends again. he was also getting off blues. i know we weren't going about it the right way but i was dumb and at least i wasnt doing blues. but i was doing subs and xanax. 

long story short... my friend of many years abandoned me and now will not talk to me. even after she lived rent free with me for over a year and got me kicked out.. she knew so much about the chemicals or at least more than me. i at least had someone on my side and we were both trying to help eachother stay clean as possible. i dont know why she just abandoned me but i guess in the scheme of things its for the better. 

at the end of dec i was trying to take less of everything and really clear my head. my ex who became a best friend was helping me stay positive and off of blues.. i still havent told anyone i have or had a problem besides them. anyway he started getting really messed up. taking subs, xans, drinking. trying to shoot up dilauded or whatever.. he was scaring me to the point i felt i needed to check on him. but it was making me want to be clean even more. i knew me and him could push past it if we had eachother.. 

he passed away in his sleep on december 30th. i started using blues again. i have never felt so alone and scared. im scared to do anything. i dont want to die but i cant withdrawl. i cant afford to do this anymore. i feel so helpless and alone.

I recently tried kicking PST about a week ago, and while the majority of the symptoms are gone, I still have gastrointestinal issues (easily my worst symptoms when I withdraw, and they last around 10 days for me). My dboy has been very reliable, but took about two hours to respond to each text today ... I left my house at 10:30, about two or three hours before I normally leave, and got a text about 45mins prior to meeting, informing me that he'd be very late. Since this would mean I'd miss the bus to my class (and I can't skip), I got to look forward to writing my entire share of a group presentation in 25 minutes, then presenting it in withdrawal. Since I had a good 20 minutes before class, I decided to ask a panhandler if he could get me dope. He asked for a dollar, I gave him one and asked if he knew where to cop. He said ""I'm sorry Mr. Officer, I can't help you,"" but I bullshitted with him a lil, and he told me he doesn't do it but knows where to get it. Of course he has the phone numbers memorized lol and we head off .. ""Surprisingly,"" he told me he has a bundle-a-day habit haha. He was really friendly, only two years older, not homeless, and we copped off a corner (keep in mind I lived in this city for four years, and have never seen a hand-to-hand). The deal was super sketchy, but the dope was **🔥 fuckin fire 🔥**. I had to pay $50 for 5 stamps (including the tip I threw), but I'm officially not sick, working on my presentation, and CAN FUCKING EAT FOR ONCE. Thanks for sitting in on my this shitpost with me, and I hope everyone has a marvelously day.

**TL;DR: My d-boy bailed at the last minute while I was sick and about to do a group presentation for grad school. A panhandler helped me cop (first time ever cold copping), and now Tuesday and Wednesday are no longer ruined.**",1487707310.0

Whatever, then i read more, and i found out that a gram of H varies from 8 to 20 euros(ok it's not good shit, you have to use the gram all at once, although once i got really good quality compared to the other times). And my dboy asks for 40 e. The last time he told me he would give me more, because he was feeling bad to make too much money out of me(at least he's honest in some way).
So this post should not be pinned, but why not make a post with the prices where you live, so we don't get fucked when we travel.
So Greece : 8-20 euros/gram, between 5 and 15% potency. Mostly you'll get the 5%.
Switzerland : buy 5 grams, it's way cheaper than buying a bag. A bag varies between 10 to 20 chf for 0.2, and 5g is 100chf to 120. This advice is valid for most of the bigger swiss towns.",1487698779.0

I just asked her how much they are giving her per day and she told me they give her 2 8mg strips/day. This is what they are recommending she take daily. She only ends up taking 1 strip a day and just keeps the extras on hand or tries to sell them.

Now get this- she has used for about 2 years but only was using 1 (maybe 2 if she got lucky) 30mg Oxy per day. Snorting. I have no idea why they would put someone on 16mgs A DAY for such a tiny(in my opinion) habit?! 

I told her to try and take the least amount as possible per day. Also warned her of the horribly long withdrawals associated with subs. I mentioned kratom to her so I'm hoping she will look into that more. I just would hate to see her have to go through terrible sub withdrawals for such a small habit, ya know?

I mean, when i was sniffing 40mg-60mg of Opana ER I would take only 2mg-4mgs of suboxone when i couldn't cop and I felt a lot better. So I really just do not understand what these doctors/sub clinics are doing.",1487864139.0

Yesterday I went to the urgent care near my house because I had really bad allergies. They prescribed me an antihistamine and gave me a shot. I asked for something for ""symptom relief"" and, like always, they wrote me a script for 60mg morphine.

Last night around 5:00 pm I took 15mg morphine and about an hour later I went into my backyard, smoked a cigarette, and started up to the sky for a couple hours while listening to music. It was sooo much fun (especially because my tolerance is non existent) but I can definitely see how people can get really addicted to this stuff. I'm gonna take 15mg again tomorrow night and then save my last two doses for some special occasions.

Anyways, I just wanted to share my experience with y'all. I hope you guys all have an awesome day!

Feet, arms, neck - all of these are not reliable anymore. I used to be way to scared to mess around with the femoral vein to the right of your nutsack (where groin and leg meet), but I finally took the plunge and hit it after three pokes only. Haven't gotten well this fast ever before.

So, in the sense of Harm reduction, I'd rather tell y'all how to do it rather than have you poke the femoral nerve artery by accident. The femoral is quick, easy and painless when done right. Here's what I did:

1.) Jump, sprint, do some physical activity. You wanna put those blood vessels to work!


2.) Now put your hands about 2 inches up from your cock and then two inches to the right/left, around where the pubes begin. You should feel a pulse thumping. This is the fem. artery THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO HIT AT ALL!!!!!


3.) Keep two fingers on the artery. Get a feel for it - where does it run to? Where does it end? Press two fingers on the artery's edge and feel the pulse . Do NOT move those fingers. You can out a finger of the other hand right next to it, on the side facing your dick, You shouldn't feel your heartbeat there, just tissue/fat.


4.) Get some long spikes. Mine are 30mm/23g, which is like an inch and a fifth I think?!


5.) Grab the spike and insert it straight into that spot next to the artery, where your fingers are pushing down. For example: if you're pushing down the right fem vein insert to the left of your fingers, always in the direction of the balls. Make sure to come as close to the fingers as possible without hitting the pulse.


6.) Insert at a 90 degree angle (straight ass down) slowly. Surprisingly, this doesn't hurt at all. The fem is the most painless injection. Now even if you have a vacuum, the blood will rarely rush in on its own. When you're all the way in, push some more, then register.


7.) Now you should see a large amount of dark red/almost black blood flood the barrel. It should be more than in say the feet or hands, since the femoral carries tons of blood.


8.) Push off slowly. If anything burns, STOP! You slipped into the artery. If you keep pushing now, you're at risk of blood clots, amputation, all that good stuff. If you don't feel resistance or pain, you're in and can just keep pushing away.


9.) Now you SLOWLY pull the needle out and discard it. Don't reuse pins in the femoral, it's so sturdy that it might break the old ones off!!!



Anyway, this is what I've been doing for a while. All my friends are too worried to shoot close to their dick and will spend hours frustratingly poking themselves. Meanwhile, I'm done in 5 seconds and already rushing off the coke, nodding and smoking a cig.



Enjoy with caution! This is still a dangerous practice. Don't make it an habit. I know it's alluring since it's so quick, easy and painless, but it'll fuck your circulation down the line.

I've been attending the IOP program, and its as boring as I remember sadly. So to fill some of the time I've been tripping on psychedelics because they're not tested for on the drug test. 

I'd like a little more variety though if possible. I'm trying to see what drugs will pop and which ones won't. Benzedrex gave me a false positive for amphetamine, and DXM gave me a false positive for PCP. I explained both of those away as OTC meds but was discouraged from taking them in the future.

Anybody know if U-47700, O-Desmethyltramadol, Kratom, and other opiate RCs will pop? I was really interested in Acryl-Fentanyl, but I'm assuming that will just show up as regular fent. Are there any benzo RCs that won't give me a false positive for traditional benzodiazepines? What about RTI-111, is it too close to cocaine for a drug test?

I know some people are gonna show up and tell me to try staying clean. I was actually considering that, until their doctor intentionally fucked with my buprenorphine prescription and replaced it with fucking garbage naltrexone. Asshole. Now I just wanna make it through program without coming up dirty and without going out of my mind with boredom. I can't even have a fucking beer for Christ's sake.

 My quick history is 2 deployments to iraq as a marine grunt. Get home dealing with moderate physical pain and moderate/severe mental issues. Developed overtime my habbit of using 3 or 4 oxy 30's and 6-10 2mg xanax bars. I ramped up to that and maintained there 3 or 4 years. Get tied to the va 3 attempts at impatient rehab and i have been clean from opiates for almost 2 years. I have had several lapse with the benzos in that time. I am currently taking 16mg suboxone a day and myental health doc doesn't want to talk about a taper down at this point and had said before it will be almost a yeat taper when i start. I see here people with habbits way bigger than mine was getting by on fractions of that. I am going to try it myself and just let him know when i am done. Any idea on a good taper schedule. I have a bunch of extra so if it gets to bad i will just hope back to normal dose. Thank you for any imput!",1487819090.0

Like .25mg for a very first dose, just to make sure it doesn't make me hellishly sick?

I know some people take subs at 12hrs and are fine, and some way over 24hrs to be safe. I have a moderate dope habit, and the local stuff is kinda fetty or RC-ish so idk if that brings the wait time down a bit or not. And then I read horror stories of PWDs where people waited the full 24hrs and still ended up in hell.

And what do you do to kill the time before it's safe to take a dose? The waiting period is pure mental hell, even when I'm physically not that bad yet. This is the worst part, imo.

I want so badly to be able to try subs and have them work to mitigate WDs, but I'm really scared after reading all of the stories on here. Help?

UPDATE: I took the teeniest bit (like .2mg) before it had been 24hrs because my legs hurt way too bad to sleep and I was hurting pretty bad. I didn't really feel anything but somehow fell asleep and slept through the entire night, so it must have worked! Woke up and felt 90% fine off of that, wow. Have been dosing .5mg throughout the day and besides feeling kinda tired and bored I feel absolutely zero WDs. Thanks for all the responses!!! I would highly suggest dosing ridiculously small if you're not sure where you stand, it worked very well for me and if it had made me feel worse, I could have waited it out pretty easily.

This is long. I hope someone will read and offer help. All replies are appreciated. Thank you in advance. 

My BIL is a heroin addict. Jack & my sister Jill have been together since they were teenagers. They are now 28 & 29. Neither of them work. They have two children that are 7 & 3. They live with my parents. 

Jack: I found out he was ""back on the dope"" late 2016. He went to a rehab for one week in Dec 2016. Yay. Our entire family was hopeful. Put on Subox. Entire family made a big deal and gave him pep talks, offered any help, etc. Jill took Jack to get subox renewed recently & he tested positive for heroin in his system. Damn! When sober Jack is a nice sensitive guy and by his own admission uses to avoid pain. Father to 7 & 3 yo. 

Jill: My little sister has only had one love her entire life: Jack. She needs antidepressants. She is not currently taking any. She has had jobs but lost them due to drugs regarding Jack. She currently has no job. Currently late on the few bills she has. At this point I believe she is severely depressed & close to going insane. Mother to 7 & 3 yo. 

My Mother: She loves her family but is enabling Jack & Jill by allowing them to live rent free in her house the past few years.* She works as much as possible to pay for all the bills due to my fathers recent disability. Note, she did not enable my middle sister or I to do this. Jill is the youngest. 

My father: He is truly ill. He finally filed for disability after working long hard hours to provide for his family. It will certainly be approved due to his various health ailments. He was never one to ""use the system"" and was severely pressured (by children and extended family) to go to the doctor to ""just check on disability."" Luckily he went and should start receiving his much deserved disability in a few months. 

Me: I'm the oldest. I'm 10 years older than Jill & saw her as ""my baby"" when she was born. I worked hard & am now retired. My first marriage ended in amicable divorce in 06 & we co-parent our children. I quickly became a high-functioning alcoholic after my divorce. Meaning I was still going to work everyday and it didn't affect my career. Not to humble brag but saying this so you understand I have some experience with addiction. I've been completely sober since Mar 30, 08. I met my current husband while I was in AA. He is not an addict; however, he did attend meetings with me while we dated. I felt it was only proper he ""knew what he was getting into."" We married in 11 & he is an excellent second father to my children. I'm thankful daily for him and sobriety. We live 30 minutes from them. 

Please, please understand I realize that alcohol does not compare to the brain alterations that heroin or opiates do. I'm not trying to downplay the effect opiates have on the brain. I'm only trying to give you a full story so you can best advise me. 

*As of last week my father said he's kicking Jack out if Jill brings him back to their house. I don't know if this will last or if Jack is back. 

After reading many posts on here I realize it is up to Jack to become sober in his time. As hard as that is to emotionally understand I'm powerless to help him. 

How can I help him now?

How can I convince Jill to:
1. Get on antidepressants.
2. Realize how Jack's addiction is affecting her and her children. Not to mention the rest of the family.
3. Get a job.
4. Support her positively.

And the MOST important question of all. How can I best help the 7 & 3 yo?
Truth, I'm afraid one of the kids will stick their self with needle and get a disease or something far worse. 

Convincing Mom & Dad of their enabling has been an ongoing battle for years. Long before Jack's addiction. The fact they both stated he isn't coming back is a HUGE step forward for them. 

Jack has stolen anything of value in my parents home to pay for drugs. He stole pill bottles to sale (or take) too. Sold his kids toys. I love him but absolutely HATE this addiction.

Lastly, in a recent conversation with Mom she started to rant about Jack. I told her to: ""Don't yell at me. I'm not the heroin addict nor the enabler."" She stopped yelling and spoke calmly. My husband said that was good for her to hear. I'm no so sure. 

Thank you for any response.

TL/DR BIL is heroin addict. He and my sister & their kids live with my parents. How can I best help the addict, my sister, enabling parents & the babies caught in this gate of hell?

The bags we're going pod but turned out to be fent, so 6 hours after my 3AM dose, I'm out the house.

The guy I met yesterday didn't have a phone and the deal was too complicated for me to get his plug's number, so I took a bus to town and walked to the corner just praying they'd be outside.

No luck.

I get about 4 blocks away by the time another homeless white dude asked me for money. This guy was clearly sick, so I gave him a dollar and asked,

""Do you know where I can get some dope?""

""*What?*""

""Dope.""

""*Let's go.*""

This guy was *not* as cool as the guy from yesterday. He was about ten years older, spewing bullshit stories Every five minutes, and asked for $20 as compared to $10 from the other guy yesterday. On top of this, he charged me $80 for a bundle, and I *know* it was cheaper.

By my estimate, 33% of my $120 investment is his come-up ($80 bun, $20 of hard, and $20 tip). On top of this, he has the audacity to ask for an additional $20!

Fuck no.

After about 45 minutes of walking, and letting $120 walk, everything seemed to come together. 

Surprise, my bundle was short a bag.

This dude kept telling me to hit him up when I'm in town and that he'd take care of me. Yeah right.

At least he used my phone to call the plug, and the plug said it was cool to call him directly next time.

I was too drunk, and when i arrived(all was hidden in my sleeves), i removed my jacket and 10 5g bags landed on the floor. My mum: what is it?  me : it's just heroin mum. my mum: how much does this cost? me : 1000chf. mum: WHAT THE FUCK????

2nd recent fuck up : one of my good dboys was renting a shitty place for about 800$/month(just a tiny room, maybe 8 sq meters)
Since my roommate had gone away with my sister, i needed someone to pay the rent with me. So i told him, why don't you come at my place, it will just be 300$ for a month.
Then he agrees, pretty much at the same time my roommate has split with my sis and comes back and asks me if he can come back. I tell him yes, but it will be a bit messy, 3 in one room...
The thing i didn't know was that my dboy was bipolar as fuck, and without any medication. Plus he has the habit of taking everything in the streets that could MAYBE be useful. Bad for me, i was in greece when he moved in. I come back to see my usually clean flat fucked up and full of junk. I'm pissed off, i tell him, and the guy loses it. He told me he would burn me and my mother if i was not compliant. I've got a friend who is a cop(we 1st met at the usual copping place, but he's a really nice cop, and basically i don't know anyone busted by this guy). So i ask him what i can do.
Meanwhile, the other bipolar is completely losing his marbles, so he fucked up my door because i wasn't there and he hadn't the keys, so for a while my door was always open(it still is, but not LITTERALLY).
So, the guy is a real nutcase, and seemed pretty dangerous. My flat got more and more filled with junk. Although he's generous with his dope, i didn't care at this point and threw him out. 
But i had to leave for Greece again, and fuck, i'm still in Greece and waiting to see the damages. But it seems ok, from what my roommate said...it's just a big mess that will take 1 week to clean.
It's not finished, because he has to come back to pick up his stuff, and he's in a completely maniac state(and from what i could get as info while away, hasn't changed).

1st time in 8 years helping homeless people to have a roof that i get some troubles(BTW i ask 300 because the govt gives 300 more to homeless people because they can't cook or have a shower...since they have everything to cook and shower/bath at my place, i just ask for the money they wouldn't have if in a flat.

To give a little backround and history about myself... I have been using illicit substances daily (whether marijuana or heroin) for 99% of my days since the age of 13 and I am now a month shy of 27. Over the past 10 years, those daily DOCs have been what we would call hard drugs, ie everything but weed. Over the last 7-8 years I Have been in and out of active opiate addiction with the last 6 years it being Heroin (IV for the last 4 of those years) Within those last 7-8 years I have had 2 stints of complete sobriety, 1 lasting just shy of 2 years and the most recent 1 year and a month. I began using again 5 months ago going straight to IV Heroin and methamphetamine. 

Now thanks for bearing with me if you lasted this long. Now either late Jan. or early Feb. I stopped using all hard drugs, did a quick suboxone taper of about a week and was completely clean from all substances for roughly ten days. I am now using again and have been (if I counted the past days correctly) for the past ~25 days. (Gosh it doesn't seem that long but we know how that goes) I started slow using a 0.2 once every couple days, then a 0.2 a day, and now for the last ~15 days I've been using 0.5-0.7g each day. BEFORE this past 15 days I had been completely clean for 5 days straight (no suboxone) (This is BTH by the way, I live on the West Coast, I have good quality connects, one very high quality so it is not rubbish tar I'm IVing here either.)

Those of you still with me, I need to quit the H like right this second. I have about 18mg of Suboxone total. 15 or so 350mg Somas, a bottle full of 300mg Gabapentin and a bottle of 0.1mg Clonidine. I have access to marijuana but I can not smoke because I have a new job starting soon (at a correctional facility) and I am still waiting for my urine to not pop for THC (its been just shy of a month and I am still + for THC). Now, my best thinking (because I am a bad dopefiend) is to use IV Methamphetamine for the first day or two or three to fend off the pain of the Opiate Withdrawal, while still allowing me to please that fiend inside me with some good IV narcotics, and supplement after with Gabapentin / Clonidine / Soma. 

My questions for you guys is... Is this a horrible plan? I feel as if I stop the H ( I have not been using meth regularly) and go straight to the subs, I'm going to pick up on day 1 or 2 because the shitty mental depression and physical pain, therefore switching to using the crystal will help stop me from picking up the dope. 

Last question... Am I just being a huge baby here? I have never been able to handle opiate withdrawal well, and I know this. Also after im completely free of the opiates and the acute physical dependance I plan on stopping all drugs and returning to AA / NA as I know how good my life is sober and I know it is possible.

Thank all, and I look forward to hearing from ya'll.",1487942823.0

I had a 3 week break to get clean in December but I got back on it, but in much lower doses, going through about a gram every 3 or 4 days. I ran out 4 days ago and have decided to not buy anymore because keeping it from my girlfriend was ruining my relationship. I'd say I'm hardly even in physical withdrawals anymore, I'm guessing because I was doing less and I'd frequently run out for 3 or 4 days so it wasn't a 24/7 habit after getting back on. I also stopped because I had no money, although I did get paid yesterday so that's not the case now.

Basically, here's what I want your opinion on. I'm not going to buy U47 again because I can't continue hiding that from my girlfriend. I know it would be best to stay off all opiates completely but I'm really concerned for the oncoming depression (that's why I got back on U47 last time) and also I just really want to get high because who doesn't. I am considering getting some brown H to only snort from the DNMs. I done this before so it's not like it's something new to me, I just never developed a problem with H like I did with U47 (I managed to hold onto 500mg of Afghan brown for months before doing it when coming off of the U47). I also figure the H will be easier to hide as it won't fuck up my nose like U47 and I won't have to redose every hour and a half like U47.

Is this a completely terrible idea? I know it's far from the best thing for me to do in the long run but having done it before, I feel like I could better handle doing H occasionally and it would be better than being back on U47. I also have access to subs so I feel that I developed a bad problem again, I would have that to help me out and get off it.

  The first thing of course that came to mind the day after when I finished moving all my shit in with the roommates that I would buy a fat sack to ""celebrate"" and I told myself no..... I recalled something another user said on this sub and when I said no and hung up the phone, it felt amazing...! I felt proud of myself. I felt like things were finally taking a turn and maybe this was the momentum I needed. Anyways just wanted to thank that special someone (you know who you are ;) ).

So I did that and he says he's only got ""black"" which I assumed was BTH at first, but then he says it's opium. I was like... Ok, so I have basically no opiate tolerance right now so opium could be fun. But then he says it's $80 for a G. I didn't respond to him after that.

[Cue next day]

I'm on CL again and there's another almost identical listing that was made that day, again. This time they say they have ""pain relief in all forms."" That's more promising, so I hit him up looking for powder H. This is where I started to get sketched out.

He responds to my email with a phone number. Nothing too weird, right? Well, I text it and nobody responds for several hours. Then he sends me another email through CL with a different phone number (he says the first number was his girl, wtf?) and offers to sell me the H I want, along with 2mg xannies ""200 4 40"" which seems cheap as all fuck. Then he says he wants to meet at a cheap-ass hotel in a busy area near the interstate.

Should I be sketched out by this or am I just being paranoid? You think it's law enforcement?

The past couple of days I've made $20 just doing surveys on my laptop (you can do them on your phone too but it will take longer) and they are paying out each time. I choose $5 PayPal payments because I have the debit card and can withdraw the funds from an ATM but there's gift cards for places like Amazon too (for those of you who like PST).

Each survey pays out a different amount of points with 100 points being $1 and you won't always qualify which is frustrating sometimes. Some walls are better than others, as in some of them remember your previous answers and can disqualify you right away so you don't waste your time. I tend to try and stick with anything above 80 points and like I said I've accumulated roughly 2300 points so far in two days $23 just sitting on my laptop watching TV in between job apps.

If you're broke and feel like it's worth the effort you can sign up via prizerebel.com OR use my referral link here https://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=PaperWolv

If you use my referral I will earn 20% of whatever your total each month so it helps me out. ;)

Some important things to do if you do sign up: give prizerebel.com a legit email and info during sign up, but when doing offers and surveys make sure you use a real email address but I would make a dedicated email address just for surveys and offers because you will get junk mail. Also I wouldn't do any survey that asks you for more personal info then you're comfortable with, most just ask general info like age, occupation, zip code etc but there have been a few that have asked me for my address or to link my facebook account to pull data from and I pass on those no matter what they are paying because there are plenty of other higher paying offers that don't request this info and still allow me to remain anonymous.

If you are interested in learning more about these types of sites and others you'd be able to make money on check out the beermoney sub here on reddit - there are quiet a lot of them online. I'm only making a post regarding this particular one because it's paying out a lot better than others I've used in the past. Last time I was taking time to use these types of sites I was only making about $20 a month. Hardly worth it!

I'm pretty sure that covers everything I wanted to say and everything the mods needed me to cover. Hope I helped someone and if you make any money doing this I hope you BANGTHATSHIT from the money you made in my honor haha",1487888101.0

Most notably there is a long thread on one of the forums with a guy named Homer who discussed having this method and using it successfully but he tiptoed around actually writing it out cause he said he worried it would encourage people to use because it makes the transition so easy. 


The basic idea is, you start taking suboxone at very small doses, small enough that it won't precipitate withdrawal, while still using. Over the course of a few days, the levels of suboxone will have built up in your system, allowing you to then stop using dope. Im guessing after the last dose of dope, you would give it like a day, and im thinking that withdrawal wouldn't come on as quickly or as intense as usual. You could easily make it to 24 hours, then take a regular full dose of suboxone and that's it.


One other thing I've heard mentioned, is taking just enough suboxone to precipitate withdrawal, but not enough to block other opiates. You then use your regular short acting opiate to stop the withdrawal, and after doing this a few times, you have enough suboxone in your system to finish up the way the other method describes.


Has anyone ever done either of these or something similar that worked for them?


Edit: One more possibility. Has anyone ever tried using naloxone (which is now available OTC in my state at rite aid) to precipitate withdrawal, to speed up the time you have to wait in order to be able to dose suboxone effectively? ",1487886460.0

After reading somewhere(maybe here) that it was great for WDs, i tried to take 3 of them, with 0.2 of 5-10% pure D and 2-3 beers : i had one of the best nodding off in YEARS. imho it potentiates heroin alcohol and benzos, and the nod was really like when i started H : crazy dreams without really sleeping, feeling like i was wrapped in pillows...

And the best thing : it's not very addictive, at least psychologically...after 6 months i had a huge stock, and no will to abuse it at all...Maybe 2x/months i would get on the Lyrica train.
4-5 years later, i'm still not abusing them, only maybe now it's once a week.

If you take shitloads(like over 400mgs) it's great on its own, only your balance is a bit fucked, and it has almost hallucinogenic properties : the floor would start to breathe, and with my eyes closed i would see patterns and shit. 

As well, it makes you chatty, anxious free, but if you don't pay attention to your behaviour people will notice. 

And the best thing : it really helps a ton during WD's, more than benzos, because it works on neurological pain.

Writing this because i'm really fucked, and i have no one to talk with ATM. Really great med. And my new counselor was like ""WTF Why are you prescribed this? "" she was almost ready to cut my supply, but i convinced her not to.

(My (her)story, some questions, and my present predicament)[Plus a kratom question]","**UPDATE** Clean for over a week (from opioids), gonna let a psychiatrist get me off the residual benzo and benzo-relatives

**TL;DR** I tell my story, but I've emboldened a couple questions asking about the type of ""self-maintenance"" or stable use cycles you ended up in. Also a question for kratom people that come here.  

I don't know how much of this story to to tell, but when I was an adolescent, we (my clique) got hooked on hydrocodone, led to anything and everything ope. Typical story. By the end of that 6+ year run I had settled in to strictly poppy (pod) tea back in the ebay days. It's really still the best high I've had on a daily basis. 

[I got clean, though, through a Christ-y 12-steps rehab. I don't begrudge them their beliefs and their system. It fucking helps people. I pushed back against the ideas of God, but bought into the steps and it changed my life. Who really knows if it's 12-steps that changes your life, 60 days with a bunch of junkies figuring shit out, or if it's just getting your literal cells and organs (brain in particular) straightened out.]

I'd never learned to take care of myself, never learned to take responsibilities, never really LEARNED (dropped out, GED, some juco). I ended up in going through comm. college for real, transfered to a state school, graduated at the top of the heap, went on to higher education. That's where i'm at right now. Earning multiple post-graduate degrees. (Yay me. Not really looking for praise, just giving context).

Somewhere before graduating from state uni, I popped into a head shop for no real reason and saw they had kratom extract capsules. I had some vague recollection of junkies using extracts to cut WD, so I knew it was related, I just didn't know it would start the whole cycle up again. [they don't want to hear this in the kratom community, but I hope to god (ha) it's banned by the time I stop using again. 

So, I'm in an academic setting, which means there's a high level of flexibility. I can get away with a lot if I produce and if I help the people around me. So, since midway through Junior year (as an older/nontraditional) student, I've been on some opioid or another. 

Kratom was cool for parties until I realized I was taking it daily, so if you're going to be addicted (and paying exorbitant head shop prices), I said I might as well try everything I found it hard to find when I was a young addict. I searched out all the molecules I didn't already know I loved, administered them in every effective way. Guess what? There's some good dope out there. Banging dilaudids. Never got to do that, and it's one of the more interesting opiate highs in the world. It's not sustainable, though, so I kept looking around. Purest of H: good stuff. Had H before, but I wanted to get some I knew was as close to pure as possible. I tried all the fents, managed to do so pretty safely, but I couldn't really be functional on those, and the high is pretty underwhelming across the board. I think I missed a couple opes. I've still never smoked opium, but I can't imagine the high is that much different than pod tea in overall quality. 

By this point my high school clique is (probably obviously) not together... or at least not with me. They're almost all methadone maintainers of a very high dose. Seeking the nods is their game. That's fine, we just don't have shit in common anymore. I'm doing things almost totally solo, with a friend or acquaintance here or there. I've minimized risk behaviors to simply scoring, and even then it's very low risk. 

To go along with that, my experiments have largely ended. I think the last thing I tried changing was switching to a fent hcl nasal spray and using it like a roller coaster. I guess I could see it work for some people, but my nose wouldn't take it, the high wasn't worth the nasal trouble, and the dose-redose urge is just too high due to duration of activity. I tried experimenting with other things (other classes), but I either hate them or need a loving social group with a similar mindset to enjoy them. That's not happening. **Onto the recent-past/present, and questions about use patterns among you all:** 

In the past 4 years, I've most maintained an opioid intake of either kratom (yeah, it counts) or suboxone, depending a couple things. (When I say maintenance, I mean I take more than enough to go beyond staving off withdrawal, less than enough to get heavy eyelids and other nod-like states.) So I'm high, but not really high, and that's how I prefer it. Sometimes, the lower the better.
 **That's question 1: How many of you reach this stage naturally? Don't want to get high high high anymore, just know you can't not be at least high.** 

Whether I used kratom or subox (wish I could just get pure buprenorphine nasal spray or even IV, I think I could regulate it better) depended on how the kratom was priced and what the results were. I would go for a few weeks realizing I was buying 20-dollar-per-dose bags from head shops (mindfuck there), buy bulk off the net, and try their different types. Ultimately, I could never stay using kratom because a) it doesn't scratch the itch quite enough, b) * I have had the eye wobbles for every single kratom dose I've had for the past year+ *, and c) it can be a pain in the ass to drink/swallow thrice daily. If it weren't so futile (and probably counterproductive), I'd probably be an anti-kratom crusader. Though, I recognize that it might be saving more junkie lives than creating people like me... some fellow academic should already have this study underway. 

**Question 2: has anyone experienced this sequence? That is, kratom being the relapsing agent, leading back to old better things?**

So now I've been on buprenorphine (usually subox strips, sometimes zubsolv, occasionally other versions) off and on, mostly on (but always something) for most of 2 years? Sounds right.

 I tried quitting with a self-taper last summer, and after realizing just how strong bupe is (8 mg is really a crazy dose for a lot of users) I was excited/hopeful that it would be a relatively easy process. Taper was fine, I didn't feel anything particularly bad other than MINOR gastro issues for 3 or so days. However, the (newly discovered to me) bupe PAWS really kicked in around this time. My pupils looked like I was on MDMA, I couldn't sleep, I hated everything while being randomly emotional at the same time. I'm sure you all know about various ope PAWS. I wasn't expecting these, and I even had someone to talk to (though not in person), and I made it 10 days total before caving and pulling into PuffsALot for a 30 dollar bag of two doses of kratom. Did exactly what I needed; I felt human again, and I haven't been without something since. 

It's not coming up on summer, so this will be difficult, but I'm tapering down again on the subs. I only have a few tiny doses left (specks that may or may not even be absorbing). My thoughts on drugs have evolved over time. I love their utility mostly. However, I understand that I don't have the willpower to not use daily classes: opioids and sometimes benzos if I stretch it out long enough. This presents a problem. 

I'm coming off suboxone, taking my max leave from work/school (1-week), based on a compromise between my SO and me. This isn't ideal. Summer would be the best stopping point, but I understand her POV. I have some tools I'm working with now: 
1. I signed up for a program for psych treatment and if they do medical, then ok. I don't know if it'll work with my schedule, though. 2. I have ondansetron (not helpful), clonidine (not helpful), and two benzos: etiz and diaz (a long and a short-acting). These meds are helpful, but the benzos are obviously a 2x-edged sword. 3. I'm finally honest with my SO, so I'll have some social support. 

I don't have any pointed questions for suboxone recoverees, but if you have any tips for making the coming months possible. Especially from a social perspective, that would be nice.

Going onto suboxone long term is and was a bad idea, I think. I remember withdrawals from tea (mostly morphine) and from hydrocodone. They were bad, but I knew what the ride was. AND suboxone was a short useful tool back then, at least it seemed to be. 

I guess I never expressed why I wanted to quit. I think that if I had a partner in crime, I'd be cool with being a lifelong (or as close to it as you could be) opiate user. I don't get that social bond using, and I don't get very high. So what ends up happening is it's just a dampener on my potential (or at least that's my excuse). My motivation is lower, my level of care for anything and anyone is mostly lower (potentially just exacerbation of underlying character traits). There's really just no upside to it anymore. Nothing new to do, and no one to share good entertaining times with in an honest way. I'll maybe make better decisions sober, but I don't know. I'll maybe be more ME sober, but I doubt that. At least not for a long time. But it really has to end, because I can't justify it logically anymore. If it were enhancing my performance, at least I could justify it. Opiates have always made menial/tedious/mindless activities more fun and maybe facilitates, but if it takes real cognitive power, opiates detract. ***[While I'm rambling, has anyone ever seen an economic study of workers in the natural range of Kratom? I've seen health-related studies, but I wonder if they are worse or better workers -- or if there's no effect].***

So my current plan is to use the benzos for the PAWS, but I'm very concerned that because PAWS for bupe is so drawn out that I'm going to want to continue benzo use for way too long. It's already been about a month straight, which I'm uncomfortable with. I've heard of anti-depressants for bupe PAWS, but this seems strange to me. I could do more research, but bupe-specific PAWS treatment doesn't seem to be a big topic in the literature. 

I didn't come here to tell me story, but maybe parts of it need to be typed out. Thanks for listening. I apologized if it was not worth your time. If you'd like updates on my subox cessation, I'll try to remember to write up daily (short) posts.

Also, anyon know why so mych blood shoots in when entering the fem vein and registering? Is that due to its importance and sheer blood volume it transports every rouundtrip through your body?

[A HELPING HAND],"i feel like i'm such a nerd but i'm going to be honest whenever i am combining separate drugs, uppers, downers, anything i always make sure the combo is safe and not too heavy of a high. Especially since i'm a lonely addict, there is often nobody there to check up on me if i happened to overdose or entered too strong of a high. Even with prescribed medications i will do this, like just today. I was recently prescribed Effexor for Anxiety/Depression, and as usual i went to check the interactions with my current scripts (Pristiq, Klonopin) to make sure, but also during my research i had learned that smoking weed while on Effexor is extremely dangerous (cardiac arrest, seizures, etc.) something i would have passed up and smoked a casual joint and found dead on my couch. As well as anything with dextro in it, a common cough suppressant/ fever reducer. I feel as being this cautious is sometimes a little too much but overdosing on certain medications can be a terrible way to die (even i am suicidal and agree this could be a terrible way to go) TL;DR : Don't assume you are a drug god, and take your high for a trip too the emergency room, remember to be aware of drug interactions and research your combo, as well as with your prescribed medications.

Long short is that he came home from checking out of a 30 day rehab 1/2 way through for heroin. Says I'm done. I made the decision to never use again. 

The next morning I found a torn in half cigarette,, not half smoked. (Torn in half with some baccy hanging out of the front.)--in my toaster oven. I didn't think too much of it but what the fuck was the deal with that? It sorta had a brownish tannish ""wet stain"" outline along the whole lower edge. I tossed it but he asked me sbout it the next day or the one after that. 

I myself smoke weed and trip occasionally. My extent of opiates is one time I had a 10mg Percocet and puked my brains out at work. And another time same brother gave me like 1/4 of a suboxone paper tablet. I thought I was dying. At work. Lol. Nodded off On my way home and totaled the car. 

I was here last night and you guys are the most helpful sub I have visited. I asked a few questions about a drug test my brother failed while staying at my house. You all helped me determine he is using heroin or morphine. Not prescription pain killers.

I've been looking into getting some meds from the dark net, and possibly from a friend of a friend. Long story short, I have a painful disorder that without insurance would cost me way too much money to manage right now. I realized after spending some time here that I have to be smart and make sure what I get is what I think I'm getting, and not pressed or cut or much stronger than I need.

What advice would you have for me on how to stay safe? How do I identify what I get and tell if it may not be legit? I'm getting codeine/acetemenophin. It's been a couple months since I had any medicine so I'm not sure the dosage but I'm absolutely certain it was less than the 30mg dose I found online. Can I cut that into fourths? What about testing? Are there any alternatives that could provide pain relief without delving into the hardcore stuff?

I know a lot of you are in recovery, and your advice will be to not do it at all. This is sage advice, but I'm not doing this to get high. I know my opiate use habits, and it stays on the shelf until I actually really need it for pain. I've lost three jobs, the love of my life and briefly my sanity to this pain before they figured it out, so it's a ""lesser of two evils"" decision. I hope to eventually ditch the meds all together and find a routine that keeps my pain in check, but until then I need a backup so if something I try doesn't work I don't have to lose my job again because I can't get out of bed for a week.

Thanks for your advice,

Anyways, my ex- and my daughters father- died of an overdose in early January. Definitely the closest I've come to relapsing since quitting heroin last May. It was of course a great way to start the New Year, and has set the tone for this year so far (bit of a downward spiral).

He died alone and homeless in NYC- he'd been living on the streets for almost exactly a year before he died. Found in a bathroom stall. His mom had to ID his body and said his lips were black. In November he went to his moms place briefly, scared and wanting to detox, but he left her house around Christmas and died about a week later. 

Autopsy report finally came in yesterday, overdosed on pure fentanyl, not ANY heroin found in his body. Also had a blood-alcohol level of .38 which is insane but he was a severe alcoholic as well. 

Just wanted to get it all off my chest I guess. It's weird because I'm already so numb to it and that makes me feel so guilty.

It reminds me a little of some of the morphine pills I've crushed and shot in the past. It radiates out through my arms and hurts like hell, but also causes a flush on my skin, a hot feeling and welts. 

There is definitely something real in it, as it will get you high/well, it's just the rush is not enjoyable. I've been doing dope for over ten years and I always remember the heroin rush as smooth, euphoric, and definitely not painful.  

Some of the younger guys are starting to pitch their dope as good because of this characteristic, but to me it shouldn't feel this way at all and definitely is not a benefit. 

I've only ever gotten dope like this since I moved to this area but I know most of the dope here isn't from here. It's brought from the northeast, often already bagged. I'm wondering if this is common everywhere now and just a result of people using terrible cuts or maybe the Fent causes this, but my experience with Fent was that the rush is awesome.

All I know is they've limited the amount of pills that can be prescribed in a prescription further, and of course the frequency that narcotic prescriptions can be made.

But today, I texted this girl I know who is on subutex about getting a few, and she told me that this is the last script she'll have. Because now, doctors in VA are no longer allowed to prescribe subutex because of the potential for abuse. Only suboxone can be prescribed. And the shittiest part is that she's allergic to the naltraxone. Imagine the hell she's going to have to go through when this last subutex script runs out.

The peeps at my rehab clinic were all ""you can't even touch a beer, IT'S A RELAPSE!!1!""
I don't care for beer you asshats. I want a warm shot, a shot like a wave touching the beach, caressing it, yielding softly and breaking.
Where the sun glows warmly, the air smelling fresh like the first breath after an endless dive. The soft music drifting through the air makes my body feel heavy and my spirit light.

And they won't allow for it. 

I only want it one last time. One last time like the first time.
I'd prefer that, it's better than living a cold life in drugery.

I want to feel alive one more time. Truely happy one more time.

And you squander that flower of hope. You don't respect it.
You just indulge mindlessly, without care and admiration of its unique perfection.

The world is a tragic place. 
To escape it, to truely live, I have to adhere to The Flower.

Well written and interesting content can be worthwhile, even if you disagree with it.

If you think something contributes to conversation, upvote it. If you think it does not contribute to the subreddit it is posted in or is off-topic in a particular community, downvote it.

Consider posting constructive criticism / an explanation when you downvote something, and do so carefully and tactfully.

Strange observation about my sober b/f.,"I met my boyfriend when he was using, though he has been sober now for years (as have I). So I have seen him both under the influence for extended periods of time, as well as sober.

When he was using he was much more sociable and in tune with people's emotions than he is sober. Socializing came much less effortlessly to him then. I'm not complaining, I just feel kind of sorry for him to see how much he struggles socially as a sober person and am pretty sure he has some kind of high-functioning autism because he really does not seem to pick up on most social cues or have a good understanding of others' perspectives. You would have NEVER guessed that about him when he was using, though. I mean, yeah, he was always a quiet guy but since he's gotten sober, it's like he's had to completely re-learn social interaction. It's not just a matter of anxiety issues and not knowing what to say (though he major issues with those things, too) - he also just doesn't intuitively pick up on emotions or social cues the way he did before (or appeared to do before), to the point of where when I met him, I actually had no idea anything was ""wrong"" with him (aside from the drug stuff). Now it's glaringly obvious that he has serious social issues. I just never thought drug use could mask such a major problem with someone? I guess it really is true that some people use to function, and it actually DOES help them function better in some ways?

Again, I don't mean to sound unsupportive or mean, I am just questioning how common stuff like this is (drugs masking major social issues/other problems and actually helping someone be MORE functional)? Would be especially interested to hear from anyone here on the autism spectrum but all replies welcome. Thanks.",1488115040.0

If I take a day break, the withdrawals kill me. If I dose JUST enough not to get W/D, life seems so boring and meaningless. My previous hobbies don't mean shit to me anymore. Maybe because I'm still in active addiction. But that's why I keep going back to using to get high. I used to spend my nights watching an NBA game or
Playing video games. I don't want to do that anymore. It's boring to me. All I want to do is get high.

It's so sad because 3 years ago I had so much fucking energy and loved life. I would wake up at 7 am. Now when I wake up at 11 before my first dose I feel like absolute shit. Life sucks. I used to use 2 times a week and would love it. What happened to me?

As a regular user (oral and nasal) of oxy 30s, I routinely get a steady but short supply of perc 10's.

Prior and leading up to this recent perc re-up, I was taking a shitload of oxy, upwards of 200+ a day and my tolerance was getting out of hand.

Then the percs come in and I ate 8 right away as per usual and got **so** much more fucked up than I've gotten snorting or eating 3 30s at a time. Not just a little bit higher but *far and away* higher.
I followed it up with 7 more 5 or 6 hours later (CWEd) and was still fucking blasted. 

I haven't been this consistently high since the last time the percs were around.

Yes, they're legit and not fakes - I watched them get filled. Round yellows with the C (or is it an L) on the back.

There are a shitload of threads about this but no real solid idea of WHY. If it were solely an issue of APAP then you should be able to take some tylenol with a couple 30s and get the same effect but it doesn't work that way not to mention the effect is still present even when you CWE.

I wish to face, flying and dying

[Nestea Iced Tea mix](http://i.imgur.com/F2kXYnW.jpg) is the best iced tea mix in the universe, IMHO. Every other iced tea, especially the ones that you get from a soft drink dispenser at places like mcdonalds or any other place that does iced tea like that.

It's definitely my favorite think to indulge on when I'm feeling fine, and even when I'm feeling sick. It gives you a good shot of sucrose when your body is using plenty of your reserves due to withdrawl.

I guess this is a shitpost, but I SERIOUSLY suggest you guys go out and get a jug of this shit and make a pitcher of it. You'll have a hard time keeping that pitcher mixed up because you'll drink it up so fast.

Oh yeah, I ended up getting my fix tonight for free because this guys dope is usually shit and I always call him out on it when I waste my money on garbage with him, so he hooked me up with a tester. Woohoo.

I work a physical job and absolutely can't call in sick, so if shit goes wrong I've just got to man up and deal with it.  
But the Docs have been messing with my script, trying to taper me off too quickly. I'm going back to my normal taper / dose next Thurs, but as of last Friday I knew what I'd be getting wouldn't hold me until then, not even close. This was further complicated by the fact that I'll very likely be drug tested on Thursday, and I absolutely can't test dirty for that so just scoring some gear is out.   
So I did what I always do when I've got to worry about drug tests - order some Fent patches. They don't show up on any of the tests I've ever had to use, in fact when I first got onto Mdone they had to send my sample to a specific lab to find the Fent before they'd accept me. But because I didn't get organised on Friday, I could only get it sent on Saturday via next day guaranteed for Monday delivery! Now the tracker hasn't updated since ~4pm on Sat afternoon (it's saying ""on it's way to [my city] from [main sorting office in the UK]"", something that normally updates around 1-2am that same night, not 24+ hours!) and I'm left here preying it arrives. Tomorrow morning is going to be bad enough, but I can easily take an early lunch (11am is still lunch right haha?) and get myself well, just as long as it arrives!!

**TL;DR -- Thank you to all of the sensible and reasonable officers out there who don't think every single person who is found with a small amount of drugs should be locked in a cage. --**

Because of my history of bullshit drug charges, I have a phobia of police, as in: my core biology reacts to the sensory input of a police cruiser or lights/sirens as if it were a life or death situation. 

I had gotten so comfortable with copping in a part of the city in which it is QUITE obvious that if you're white you're there for drugs. 

I was there around 4am to cop and as I was about to start my car to leave I am blocked by a cruiser as they are getting out and approaching me. I start to panic and toss the single bag I had to the floor in an act of pure laziness to hide it. 

After I asked why they blocked me they simply said because I was white. They then sequestered me behind my vehicle as they found the bag and asked if that was all I had. I confirmed this and one of them commented on how calm I seemed. I explained that I knew that I was panicking and forcing myself to be calm. *(when I am sober I do this dissociating thing whenever shit gets overwhelming)* 

After asking where I am from and whose car it was they basically just let me go after one of them exuding some of the most genuine and human expressions I've seen from a person, while thanking me for being cooperative and nonconfrontational or defensive. 

He said, *""Remember my face. If we stop you and you don't make our job harder, you don't go to jail.""*,

They never ran my name or my tags. My idea of what happened is that they were only concerned with figuring out if I had mass quantities or was dealing. Once they figured out I could only afford one bag they felt sorry for me basically.

Or my perception could be totally wrong and it could just have been that I was white in a non-white neighborhood. All I know is I didn't go to jail and that's a good thing, and I am never copping there again. 

This also triggered me to think that, yeah, I should just stick to Kratom.",1488142336.0

I usually avoid dosing in the mornin until I shit if enough coffee and Adderall allows it but some days it is impossible.  After trying every stool softener and fiber supplement possible I have settled on the only laxative that works in under 12 hours guaranteed, not that shit where you need to wait a couple days.

Everyone needs to go out and buy a pack of the generic bisacodyl (Dulcolax) as it is only like 5 bucks and works overnight.  The box says to only eat 1 to 2 5mg doses but with opiate constipation I have to eat about 4 of them, 5 if it's awful.  I chew them up and within 6 hours can feel them starting to shift my guts.

I warn you that this is only if you have literally nothing to do the whole day as within 10 hrs you will begin running to the bathroom every 30 minutes.  If you take 4 or 5 you will get some pretty bad stomach aches which feel close to the cramps you get in withdrawal, but the best part is knowing you have (hopefully) opiates left for after you empty yourself and the feeling of an empty colon.

Doing this regiment I probably will take at least 10 shits over the course of a day and I'm not exaggerating.  They flow out like water and aren't stretching your butthole open, it feels seriously so good to have a day of nonstop shitting that I do this once every week.  I probably lose at least 5 lbs, possibly 10, and even my pants don't fit right afterwards.  I'm in the midst of one of those days and it feels awesome after not shitting for a couple days.  Do not take more than 5 of these pills though as you will have the worst stomach cramps and your can get super nauseous.  Once you are completely empty your stomach can still ache a little at which point it's prime time to dose your opiate as it kills the stomach cramps and you get buzzed without feeling stopped up.

     Got .2 ECP and .1 crack to take my breath away within the next 5 minutes. Also just ate .13 of crystal meth to keep me awake and decently speeding incase the crack comedown is a little rough. 
      My brother ended up doing his 'holy trinity' shot when I did mine just now. I decided to shake it up real good and give him half so he doesn't get sick on the plane. 
      Ima add .2 ECP to it so there's a bit more  of H rather than speed. I also have a shot with 2 small/medium sized lines of coke in 25 units of water. Plan on doing that in a restaurant restroom after breakfast. 
      I'm also going to do a .3 shot of of H and smoke a blunt 10 minutes before I walk into the airport. Check in blah blah blah, chill while parents and grandma eat lunch, then go SLAM the 'holy trinity' in the restroom right before we walk up to security.
    Ima set a timer on my phone for 7min, and my brother will set one for 4min then go 'pee' to be sure I didn't fall out (never done this much H and two kinds of speed mixed into a shot). 
       The reason I set mine for 7 is so I can feel the full effect of the rush for 5min or so before I face my parents and grandma. I can guarantee they won't know I'm high all morning. But when I exit that restroom, with 4 days of binging on Heroin, Crack, Meth, and Cocaine (never went to sleep yet). There's a good chance they'll be able to tell I'm loaded. 
      The ate reason I ate the meth is so I can stay awake the whole flight that's 6 hours in total (while enjoying a hella good nod), get checked into the rehab, set up my bed, unpack my bag, talk to a few other clients, drink some water, then do nothing but SLEEP for the next 36 hours lol.

I can actually say I went out with a 'bang'. I think I got all the ""partying"" out of my system. Definitely a binge to remember, had a ton of fun these past 4 days.


TL/DR: Plans for getting high and spacing out my drugs throughout the day to stay awake til I get to rehab as I'm on the tail end of a 4 day, almost 5 day Heroin, Crack, Meth, and Cocaine binge. 
     TO ANYONE WHO IS ABOUT TO IV WHEN READING THIS, CHEERS TO YOU!

Shit.,"Needless to say, 0/10 would not recommend. And I'm not really trying to make light of the situation that I'll be honest really quite scared me. 

Over the last few months, I have managed to stay a recreational user, only once or twice every few weeks. Pfft I don't really know how, but I have been none the less. 

Well, I hit up my boy (basically my main connect) and he tells me ""Yeah, I'm omw back from re-up so I'll stop up to you on my way home"" Now this guy is a pretty good connection. Never really had much of a problem with him at ALL and he's always been straight up with me about price/quality, if he's got bags or grams, and it's always been a successful deal with never to much waiting. And it's always consistent. He always tells me if his shit changes. 

Mistake Numero uno. 

Anyway, I grab 6 bags from him cuz it's all I really had the cash for, and that would normally get me a very nice high, without it being to much. He drops it off. I go into my bathroom. Mix up 3 because like I said all I could afford was 6, and that would normally get me 2 buzzes. 

Ahh, so I plunge, and almost immediately think damn, that's some strong shit right there. I walk outside to my rides car to go to the store, maybe 30 seconds after I hit and BOOM. Next thing I realize it's like 2 hours later and I'm in the hospital, vomit all over me, and they are sitting there telling me I stopped breathing for who knows how long and they did not thing I was going to make it.

I'm assuming it was fent cut, because I've never had that happen to me, I'm always careful, and like I said my boy told me it was the same from the other day. 

Needless to say fam, that was some god damn scary shit. My second mistake was thinking that that could never happen to me. Oh how wrong I was. Only took about 1 minute from the time I plunged to the time I hit the ground. Thank God my friend was there to call 911 and get me to the hospital quick enough.

That honestly is probably the most freaked out I've ever been. And looking back on it I never would have even known I fucking died. I don't remember a fucking thing until the ambulance ride was half over and even then it's really just one big blur. 

I don't really know why I'm posting this other than to say I'm damn grateful for narcan and to be alive. Also I just want to reiterate. ALWAYS TEST SHOT OR SNIFF A LINE. I got too confident in myself and put in too much trust for my boy. You honestly never know what you are getting and you can NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER be too careful.

I'm still very groggy and I'm planning on falling asleep very soon. Just be safe out there fam. I got cocky/over confident and that shit put me in my place fucking faster than you can even say the word Narcan!!!
 

So please, stay safe. Sorry for the wall of text and if anyone has any questions I'll be happy to try to answer them to the best of my ability. 

TL:DR 
Got the shit I thought was the same as the other day. Did half of what I would normally do to save bags. Very nearly died because I was over confident in myself to be able to spot what I assume was mostly fent.

I don't know how to drum up responses on reddit (does it require a history and profile?), but I'll give you some of my experience: 


AWARDS:

 
Most potent: Hydromorphone. I'd love to say I had a vial, but no this was a pretty crude extraction. Every time. The rush is like no other I've tried, and it's almost unpleasant (you start to like it). The high doesn't last long, and it's fun. But it's mostly worth it for the rush. 

Oxycodone - MOST VERSATILE: Banging oxy (again, in unsafe ways), was very fun for me in like Nov to Christmas of 08. I felt the injection was worth it, that there was a rush (contrary to reports), and that the OC high continued afterward with no real loss in quality (maybe shorter action) 

Fentanyl - (Most Scary, all derivatives included) no thanks. I was much too concern with getting the dose right, and I wasn't interested in the IV effects due to my experience with other ROAs. Did I miss out? 

Heroin - (the funding narcoterrorists vs pharma award) The classic we can no longer trust. It's a nice high, and we're wasting most of it by any ROA that's not IV. But I still think that some pills have more to offer (morphone if you want rush, OC if you want full gamut). 

Demerol: THE FUCK THIS AWARD. Every time I was given this in the hospital I felt awful. I don't actually know if it's an opiate because I haven't cared to delve into why it was so bad. I hope it's not used now.

Never banged Oxymorphone, low levels like HC and Codeine (is this injectable? 

Are there overseas-available opes that are injectable that i'm missing. I'm in the midst of quitting, but I still think about what I've missed quite a bit--a bad sign, I'm definitely aware of. 

As there's been a great effort in extracting the constituent alkaloids of kratom, has anyone heard of injecting any of these? Seem like it could give a clear idea of what's going on with each alkaloid from an experiential perspective. ",1488242147.0

                                  I don't feel like I have anyone around me that can relate to this. 

   Most of my kisses from men have been imposed on me. Only one guy ever asked before I even gave an answer, which was still a resounding ""no"". I'm demisexual, so I don't get physically attracted to someone until we share emotional connections. I'm also physically attracted to seeing emotions being expressed. It's frustrating because I'm too sensitive to how people feel, so much that I don't want to hurt the persons' feelings who is imposing themselves on me. There IS a part of me though, that really wants to punch them in the face because I feel like I'm being misunderstood. I'm very kind to everyone around me (people pleasure) and I'm sure most of ya'all readin this can relate to that. I suppose the only logical conclusion for the imposed kisses is that the person thinks I'm flirting with them when I'm not. I've also had to learn that just because a man says something doesn't mean its the law or ""right"". I use to really doubt myself because I thought men were right about everything. I've since learned I can have my own opinions and feelings and that means I can be kissed when I'm ready and willing. I was able to eventually kiss this wonderful man who asked, but that was because we shared emotions. We watched a movie for our first date together, turned down the volume and did the voice overs like they do on ""who's line is it anyway"" :P He was so clever and witty I felt an instant connection. 

   When I finally built up the courage to kiss him, i just understood how life works. It's a romance, it's a dance. He has the biggest softest lips I'll ever know. His heart was my home. I ended up researching this and found this kind of partner connection is called a twin flame, beyond soul mates. Anyway. Since this man has left my life I often miss his touch and sometimes turn to others to relieve the pain temporarily... but it never makes me feel better. In fact I'd dare say it makes me miss him more than I did before I tried to relieve myself. He's addicted to heroin and will die from it just like everyone does (only 1% make it). He stole from me countless times to the point I fell back into a deep depression which I'd finally fought off after 25 years of going in and out. Which he I'm sure he will never understand, the reason I had to kick him out of my life. In my 5 relationships I've been the mom and the dad while babysitting my partner. Which was what this last resembled yet again, to my greif. I raised my 3 siblings, since i was 7, so this mother mentality is ingrained in my other relationships as I understand it. I've never had the chance to be a kid and what cuts deeper than my own inflictions are people that you give too much to that don't stop you from giving too much. I've loved deeper than i could afford.

   In my past I dealt with 17 of my years using bulimia as a coping mechanism and outlet for my self hatred. The hatred that built up by listening to everyone's criticism around me, telling me to be more perfect in every single way to the point I realized I had to be over perfection and have since made unrealistic goals of myself and been incredibly impatient with myself in accomplishing which of course turned into generalize anxiety disorder and depression follows. I don't know if you've had a similar life but I'm a very stunning woman, and you'd think life was easy because of that I mean it appears to be in the media right? Well.. actually people hated me for it and because of this I always thought I was ugly developing body dysmorphia... until I became healthy and started loving myself. I take full responsibility today realizing I allowed others to determine my value. Veganism is what healed the bulimia for me, even though I have a kapha body type which means I crave meat above everything (sugar/breads/dairy). But... when I get depressed, veganism is usually the first to go and I slip into old habits of cutting and using intense laxatives after every small meal.

   Twin flame separation is very depressing in the initial stage I mean essentially it's the mourning of a lost part of you. Your mirror, the side you were finally able to learn to love... and wanted to keep. Push through this and it's rage and anger who will be your greatest friends while you use it as fuel to recharge you life and put your shattered heart back together. And after this? Finally acceptance sinks in and through so is an incredible peace just knowing that.. if it's meant to be it will be. Back to the sad part...There's something about the bulimia eating disorder that makes me feel powerful over my body, like I can do whatever I want without consequences (eat shit and not gain weight.. you know) but I always regret it afterwards because the laxative form of bulimia doesn't do what you think it's doing.. you still retain all the calories but it just dehydrates the living PHO out of you. 

  Hopefully this rant will help heal someone. XO HA!

 My first experience on reddit was trolling because I was so use to the facebook mentality and I was even more hidden on here than other social media, only to realize this was a great space to just be yourself and people would accept that. Even if they don't, being on the other end of trying to cause pain because I felt great pain I'll understand when someone shoots a dagger my way. KARMA too. It felt great to delete my facebook account. 

   Soooo My twin flame.... I realized after a while, DOES look a lot like Brendan Fraser.. I don't like admitting that because my twin flame looks so much MORE beautiful to me. After revisiting a childhood fav of mine ""George of the Jungle"" , I understood that... MY LIFE IS A LOVE STORY. The Ups and downs, its all a part of this story I'm writing and acting in. It sucks being without my true love. I mean honestly sometimes I feel so pathetic for loving him so much. HE IS MY HEROIN. 

Clearly i loved him more than he had the capacity to love me..because his entire soul was givin to another. 

  I keep thinking, ""why can't i just move on?"". I love him more than he will ever love me and I refuse to compete more than I have which is more than most anyone I know would have done for someone.. partly why he's gone. He ran away in the end though. Maybe I love men that don't give me the attention I deserve because my childhood resembled a very similar story. I know most of you kids grew up with a TV in the home, which sucks the attention you deserved instead right out of your parents capacity. I've never had a relationship where the love was equal, in fact I always gave far more than I ever got back. 

I consider myself strong for trying 5 times, but each time it gets harder because I start doubting my heart. That's probably what weighs me down the most. I want to be able to trust my feelings and my head. I felt like I'd earned love.. but we can't do or say anything to MAKE someone love us the way we want to be loved. Not that i was trying to force anything, I just really wanted to win him over heroin. A las heroin wins.. 

   I'm LIVID with the pharmaceutical companies now that i've learned how powerful heroin is and how it starts; Pills = HEROIN = death. Big pharma doesn't care who it kills and it's killing. 

Legalizing a plant would heal a lot of these problems too. 

  The biggest thing that came out of this lesson was my knowledge of who to help in this world, a mission or purpose if you will. There's lots of homeless who innocently starting with what the doc prescribed and naturally got addicted and now they have no place to live surrounded by a society that belittles and ignores them. If you haven't listened to Macklemore ""drug dealer"" great sum up of what I'm trying to express here. And if you're like me and go through spells of depression, visit with a homeless person sometime, they know the ins and outs on happiness because they have nothing and they've had to learn how to handle life's greatest storms. Imagine your greatest addiction physically consuming you to the point of stripping your relationships and finances but you don't even noticing or care that it's happening. Well this man did the very same to me, I almost lost my place and my loved ones because I was so addicted to him...

 The studies scientists have done on rats indicate the results we thrust upon human subjects.

 Share your love story please? 

  Sadly yours,

 XOXO  A hotmama diva",1488238341.0
5wk969,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/5wk969/just_lost_a_friend_to_an_overdose/,10,https://redd.it/5wk969,_marlasinger,Just lost a friend to an overdose,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but I'm hoping I can get some advice or clarity after these last few days..

A lifelong friend of mine overdosed this past Wednesday. The day before my birthday. I'm at a total loss for words, even 5 days later I can't wrap my head around what happened. He had, as far as we know, been clean for a year and a half before Wednesday morning. He'd been battling addiction for 11 years. Got started by his buddies on his high school hockey team. Multiple team members have passed the same way. 

I remember standing with him in my kitchen last 4th of July and he told me he was a year sober. I was beyond proud. I thought he was over the hump ya know? The worst was behind him. I don't know a whole lot about heroin or the hold it has on people. I studied addiction briefly in college and became a social worker after, was trained to give Narcan but still never really knew a ton about it. I feel some guilt over not doing more research or trying to help more. But I know that it was his battle to fight. 

My mom called me at work Wednesday morning and told me they found him. I couldn't even form sentences. He was living in an apartment with his friend he met in rehab years and years ago and he was the BEST thing for my friend. If it wasn't for him I fear we would have lost J years ago. His friend came home in the morning and saw that J hadn't left for work yet. Went into his room and saw him bent over on the bed, face in a pillow. He ran out to the car wash where our other family friend works and they both ran back. My friends Dad jumped onto J to wake him up. Did everything he could. J was already getting cold and everyone was just a little bit too late. I struggle with this part the most. Was J scared? Did he know he had done too much or that it was cut with something else? Do you know when it's too much? I just have so many questions. With all of my heart I wish that he went peacefully. 

Maybe this is hitting me so hard because I've never lost a friend before. Always older relatives due to age, some from cancer. I've never lost someone my age and had to see them in a casket. It's fucked up. It's more fucked up because he was SUCH a good person. I didn't know his addiction or see him high or struggling. I saw J as I met J. Smiling, laughing always with the best sense of humor. He was friends with everyone, accepted everyone, loved everyone. His mother thanked me over and over for never giving up on J or abandoning him when others did. I don't feel like I ever gave up but I definitely wasn't there for him as much as he might've needed it. His parents said they always had this thought in the back of their mind that one day they'd get this phone call. But I never did. Never in a million years would I think he'd overdose. Not J, J is different. He wasn't. 

I've read through other posts of people going through the same thing and maybe I just needed to vent.. but I'm having a hard time coming to grips with all of this. Thanks for reading. ",1488237681.0

One thing that kinda sucks is I burned a hole in my old checking acc like 2k which now got sent over to collections, so when i do get out and get a job im gonna get some of my wages garnished.... kinda been bringing me down a bit, but honestly not really. Im so happy. And it feels nice to have quit cigs too, I can breathe like a champ. And the best part of all of this, music sounds amazing!!!!

I tried a couple small lines of it and could def smell the vinegar/feel the burn, so it was a great success IMO. I love smoking tar but feel it is almost as wasteful as smoking roxies, so to find another method that works better for me is great.

A little back story. I moved to this little shitty town 6 or 7 years ago on the back of a massive methadone addiction. I knew nobody and there isn't a ""hood"" per se to try to cold cop in. It took me 2 years to get my first connect. It was a really good connect though as I still use him to this day and we're friends to boot.

Well my guy is out now and the only other connect that's good today is 1.5 hours away and won't even be good until tonight. 

Well, going backwards in my story a bit I have this black dude that used to come into the place where I work looking to get work  done super cheap. He's a cheap bastard but I genuinely like the dude in spite of myself and started doing work for him on the side but at half the price the retail store I work for charges. Needless to say, he's a good customer. I always knew he partied, insofar as drinking and smoking weed goes, and decided that if things got bad, I'd see what side of the fence he sat on regarding pills.

Turns out his cousin, who is a mere 15 mins away, always has 10mg R/P IR's. He wasn't sure what she sold, actually, and I was envisioning him rolling up with a fist full of 5mg vicoden or some other crap. After confirming from her that they were ""oxycodone 10mg"" I just assumed they were percs but nope, they were the IR 10's - I really don't ever see those...like **ever** but they crush fine and feel fucking great.

The reason it's a big deal to me is that *all* of my connects are 30 mins away or more....the most being 1.5 hours away. I spend a small fortune on gas each week so finding someone that's less than a mile from my house is a true milestone for me.

So yeah, I know it's a long story and I could have just said ""I got a new local connect!"" but the pills are kicking in and I'm feeling typie ;)

**TL;DR:** Finally got a connect that is 2 mins from my house after spending 5 years driving all over hells' half acre for drugs.

Hope everyone has as good a day as I have had!
