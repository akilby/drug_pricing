The date on it said it was from about 8 or 9 months ago and the script was for about 60. It looked full so I decided what the hell and took the whole damn bottle. Also found about 10 hydro 10s to go along with it. Right when I was driving home I broke Down about 5 Right then and there. When I counted how many there was it was 56 of them. Jackpot.

Although, my pupils are pretty pinned..

So, I’m curious as to what you guys think?

Fakes or are these pills just old or something?

Also, if they’re fakes is there any cause for concern? It’s been almost 3 hrs since my initial dose, would I know by now if I needed to be worried?

Another thing, tbh I’ve never had an oxy 30, I usually get hydrocodone 10’s. Is the experience any different?

I've been using opiates for 5 or so years, heroin for 2, but only started IV-ing a little over a month ago. My heroin use increased a lot since codeine became prescription only on 1 Feb. Before that I was mostly a codeine addict, and would get H when I could afford it. I was also unemployed up until 5 weeks ago so now I can afford all the H I want (except I'm currently in withdrawal because I lost my bitcoin cash deposit to a certain DNM and still haven't got my coins back).

There was no fent or anything in this dope, I just had too much. I got careless. I had too many times where I had too small a dose and had to make another shot, and I only have one vein I can usually get to, and only get 5 needles at once. I should have invested in good quality mg scales or at least used the crappy one I have. Other than that I was careful and sterile with everything.

The amount I dissolved was in one solid rock so it looked like much less than it was and I actually thought it wouldn't be enough.

I hide my usage from my boyfriend and housemates. I like to shoot up in the shower/bath (it's a showerhead over a bathtub). It's a nice place to do it, it's private, and I tend to bleed so being able to rinse it away right away helps. 

I didn't fill up the tub this time, I just turned the shower on so I could feel the warm water running down my back. I was excited that I got a vein so easily and injected it all at once. Usually I would titrate the dose, which means I don't get the same rush I could, but I'm less likely to die. This time I felt it, the rush. But I knew, as soon as I felt it, that I'd had too much. I had that feeling of losing control. I told myself ""it's okay, I'm still conscious, everything is fine"". I managed to take the needle out of my arm but didn't manage to put the needle cap back on. The next thing I remember was hearing my boyfriend calling my name from outside. I didn't know what was going on. I know that for a second I felt annoyed at being woken from such a peaceful slumber, even though I had no idea why I was lying asleep in the bathtub. 

Once I realised where I was and what was happening, I got up as quickly as possible and turned off the shower. I responded to his calls asking what was wrong. He was saying there was water leaking out into the hall. I was so confused because the bath was empty and the bathroom floor was completely dry. But my main concern was getting rid of all the evidence of my shooting up. I found the needle, couldn't find the needle cap so put it in a sharps container, and I quickly shoved everything else into a bag. 

I then got out of the bath and tried to find out what was going on. I was so fucked up, but luckily no one could tell. My housemate came into the bathroom and saw that the bath faucet had completely caved in, leaving a hole in the wall. I must have been lying there unconscious for 1 or 2 hours, after falling backwards and causing the hole in the wall, with the water running, which explains how it leaked into the hall.

At first I didn't even understand that I'd overdosed because of course I couldn't remember being unconscious. And I didn't understand how the faucet had broken because I didn't remember falling (I must have fallen after I became unconscious - which would make sense), and I was still so fucked up I couldn't feel the pain in my back. I remember staring at the broken faucet trying to understand, and I could barely even see because heroin affects my vision so much. 

I was in no state to do anything at that point. I stayed in the bathroom and got dressed but I got back into the bath. I wanted to make sure there was no more evidence. Plus the bath seemed like the safest place to be since I was barely functioning. I still hadn't found the orange needle cap, that last piece of evidence. Then I was pretty sure I saw it go down the drain and for some reason thought it was possible and necessary to get it out of there. I thought the plumber would find it and say ""here's what caused the issue"". At that point I still didn't understand what had happened. And my understanding of basic plumbing was missing because I was looking for the needle cap in the hole in the wall, amongst the broken tiles, after failing to get it out of the drain (it was properly down the drain). There was no way the plumber would come to fix a faucet and replace some tiles and find something that had fallen down the drain, but it took me a while to figure that out.

Eventually I decided sitting in the bath any longer would just seem even more suspicious, so I got out and helped soak up the water in the hall. I said I would get a plumber to fix the faucet. For some reason no one questioned how it broke.

I only pieced it all together later when I saw the bruises (and felt the pain) on my back, remembered the initial rush and feeling like I was losing control, and had vague memories of a peaceful dreamlike state while lying in the bath.",1523713909.0

That is the question!! HEROIN CRACK detox! 29 years of addiction an realisation the power of addiction,"Http 

I’m new on this site as I’m detoxing off heroine an  crack (speed ball ) of late choice.. 
I have a good job that pays well ! 

I came out of prison at 22 after a 3 year stretch an moved to London 
I’m now 38 so 16 years in all in London !! Ups downs !! You know the drill !! On script off script etc !!  I have used drugs from the age of 8 when I got hold of gas ! Glue ! By 11 it was LSD then by 13 PUTTY BASE going to RAVES ILLEGAL 
DREAMSCAPE!! FANTASIA ! Etc 
I was made homeless at 14 so no parents just me ! Never had parents anyway so no different there ! 

I met my best pal HEROINE age 16  about the time my good friend David hung him self as he has   schizophrenia. Very bad and guess could not cope! 
So my new pal who promised to love care ease my pain feeling make me confident as I was a shy kid withdrawn an felt different from every one else !!! I now know a fuck load of LSD an SPEED at a young age fucked my mind up before it’s could develop! 

Anyway been 3 years clean and in that 3 years made an amazing life an traveled so many times even did my 2 months drive through Greece gap year thing ! Made life long friendships all over the world! 

Long story short I bust snapped my ankle Oct last  so out of a job as self employed! So no job 
My partner split up due to there getting caught cheating on over 16 time I know of ! 

So the picture  is me in a room plaster cast on can’t move so bed bound ! 
A million thoughts going through my head !! 

Hurt pain heart broken as I thought it was for life !! 
And then other thoughts creep in from my past thoughts I’ve locked away forever!!! An as I’m an over thinker! 
I need to be active !! 

So a bank account pretty flush ! House bound and head fucked ! No prizes what I did to numb the pain and block the feelings!!! 

Anyway 5 odd 6 months on I think nearly £15000 lighter I’m a total wreck!! CRACK was never my thing and have used it on off for 20 years 
But doing snow balls it caught me by the balls!! 

I’ve never had an addiction this bad before! 

To the point I would literally feel like I’m not me an I’m on a different planet! 
Then all a sudden on day 5 or what ever binge it is I would have a sudden realty check and realise I’ve not slept an I’m buy an buy drugs with out even thinking about the cost !! 
Or consequences! 
An I’d be like fuck sort this out !! 
But 3 hours later it almost like something had removed that thought from my head and I’m back on point ! Shotting ! 

I’ve always been a grafter and went to college got NVQ 1/2/3 in what I do ! While addict to gear but only dark !  And been on build sites from 15 years old !! I did do crime for a few years but going to jail was the best thing ever!! I did 12 month Rebab and did my maths an English diploma in prison as I left school age 14 with nothing I think .. 

I’ve maxed my money saved I’ve maxed credit cards I’ve maxed a loan I got to pay off the maxed. Credit cards and then maxed the credit cards I payed off ! An also lint £4000 of a mate !! 

My mind has shut of like self presentation! 
As I think I’m to scared to admit what mess I’m in !      “ ah it’s ok all will work out “ 
That thinking !! 

Anyway I have Subutex but I can’t seem to do the 48 hour detox raw before I take them ! I’ve tried and lasted 16 hours then took 4 mils of Subutex!! 

I was thrown in to instant withdrawals like I’ve never felt !!!!  ANSWER = a tenth of Dark done till I felt better !! So I’m bloody struggling that way ! 

I got 100 30 mil codine phosphate yesterday so hope I can reduce my habit with them enough to switch!! 

I’ve done bare back detoxs in prison 2 time s 
And say 7 other home detox with Valium DF118s and sleeping pills 

My only fear is it seems detoxing is getting harder the older I get !! 

I’m an never amazed at how powerful addiction is and what you become! You lie to your self convince your self it ok ! 

And the funny kicker is anyone who uses drugs and is about drugs users that the only time ever I mean ever anyone talks about getting clean is when your high !!! The best bloody intentions when high ! Your make plans call people set stuff up but as soon as you start the comedown that plan everything you just spent 2 hours talking about is totally history !!!! 

You’ve deleted every drug dealer number from your phone and this is the 10th time you did that !! So your cursing as you need that number!!! Lol anyway

During that time I learned a few, legal, tricks and loopholes. For those of you who have state funded insurance it’s a little harder to do but still possible. Say you have a prescription that has like a $500 copay because America is fucked. Go on that drugs website and search ‘savings card’. You’ll most likely have to enter an email or a phone number. In doing so you’ll receive some numbers that can be used in place of your state insurance card. They look like this 

ID Number - 123456789 (sometimes up to 3 letters in the beginning)
BIN Number - 123456
Rx Group - ABCDEF
PCN Number - 1234

Now keep in mind, if you have state insurance it will not work in conjunction with that insurance. However, with that being said, nine times out of ten the ‘savings card’ is cheaper than what the state is willing to pay. Sometimes pharmacies will be dicks and if they already have your state insurance on file, they won’t even apply the card for you by itself. Go to a different place and use just the savings card. 

If you have private insurance, you’re in luck. You will be able to use both your insurance as well as the ‘savings card’ to drop your copay even lower. 

I have had copays drop hundreds of dollars by doing this for customers. One time that sticks out is a women coming in just looking completely fucking defeated. Her husband was not taking his psych meds because they could no longer afford the full month, so they’d get as many as the insurance allowed a month. Which was NOT enough. I was able to get her a full months supply with an extremely low copay. Use this advice for your scripts people. I can’t guarantee that it’ll work on opiates, but it does on most (not all) meds, especially name brands. Be good to each other and stay safe.

Whats your thoughts?,"First off I never did this I only remember reading about it a while back so the details are a little fuzzy...

Basically, if I remember correctly it went a little something like this; someone in the US on government-sponsored healthcare goes to a lenient doctor (not pill mill) and is prescribed a prescription for opiates they don't *need* or they are over-prescribed. Then for much much less than street costs or online pharmacy costs which can now exceed $1 a mg... but either part of or the entire months supply from said person. The story I recall, someone purchased the entire prescription, a supply of **120** 30mg Roxycodone, for somewhere between $250-$300.

Like I said, I have never done this and it is unlikely I would ever even have the opportunity to - but shit if I could I would do it in a heart beat. Thats less than 1/10th the street price. This has to be by far the cheapest way to get real pharmacy oxy without getting your name put into the state database avoiding some of the unfortunate consequences that come along with that.

So what are your thoughts? Has anyone ever heard an easier way to get roxy this cheap with as comporable risk or less? Share your story if you'd like.",1523694646.0

Got them took 2 10s at first with 1.5mg kpin which is my daily script so i have a decent tollarance to benzos. I have lots of experience with opioids done them all. Now the thing that made me think these were fake was how strong they were i ended up puking 5 times which isnt normal i couldnt stop knodding i ended up having to lay down to help nausea and i noticed my breathing was the slowest its ever been ever i was actually getting worried. Ive token 40mg with 2mg kpin with a mild tollarance to opiates back than and didnt compare to this at all. Is it possible for these people to press oxycodone neos? I believe oxyneo is only available in canada but might be wrong. I just took 10mg of these neos just 40 mins ago along with 2mg kpin and feel like im on 20mg or 30. Is it the clonazepam doing this ? Ive been on it for 5 months now 1.5mg daily and always used to take them with 40 or 20 mg all time and never compared to these. I have some photos of them doubt thatd help they look just like real ones. Also noticed texture when chewing them felt sticky and would get stuck in my teeth. Now im getting nauseas again wtf 10mg about to make me puke wtf im knodding out while typing heres photos holy fuck

- hot compress after each shot, even if it’s not a miss, to allow blood to flow and prevent bruising/swelling.
- shower at least 1x daily to renew and resurface skin. Clean skin is regenerating skin. Tracks seem to appear darker when you haven’t showered for 2 days and they’re purple and scabbed.
- exercise. Obvious one.
- hydration and daily vitamin
- **new works every single time. Knowing the proper way to IV and how to sanitize.**
- Wash your hands. Sanitize the area with an antiseptic foam or spray, alcohol pad. New cotton. Toss stick in sharps. 


That’s all I can think of. But I think this is something that is good to cover bc I am ashamed of them every day and it’s a dead target giveaway. “Who you go thru”

well my weed dealer is also a guy who is in a lot of pain and shit and he also happens to sell opiates. just tylenol w/ codeine (t3s), hydromorph 30s and dilly 8mgs. sometimes I get a hydro 30 but they cost $50 and make me super irritable and they don't come close to how fun snorting the dillies are. and how nice I fucking feel right now 

I heard pluggings even better. my guy lets me put shit on my ""bill"" and it's already at $200 (these canadian prices) so i told him to stop it at that no more until i pay him on tues.

i can maybe see this kinda getting outta hand because i feel like right now i'm fully appreciating the opiate high that is obtainable from these little pills. and it feels damn good. Methadone was very nice too the one time hehad it. I've tried heroin twice but each time got sicker than fuck so it doesn't really appeal to me (maybe too high of a dose?) but these DIlly 8mgs make me super talkative and give me a very very very nice energy boost and damn. just ndamn.

I know it’s good to stay sober, but damn, it was right there, I was so happy and excited and relieved, it was just a huge feeling of FINALLY... and it was just a dream.

Do you cut them out? Or do you understand their concern? Can I get some advice?","I'm currently 27, started chipping h last April. Around June one of my close friends that I lived with at the time and had known since I was 16 called me drug addict and talked down to me about money management acting like I was going to become a helpless druggie when he found out I was using, even though I was only a weekend warrior. It really pissed me off and I never fully forgave him for some of the stuff he said. Along with some other shit he did I started to withdraw and hang with other people and continue use on the weekends. 

I found out a couple of months ago that him and a female friend of mine were gossiping about my use with each other. He told her himself, I never wanted anyone else to know. After this I pretty much cut them both out and no longer respond to their calls or texts. I just want to know if you guys think I'm overreacting at all? I know heroin is serious business to most people, but I'm not a judgemental person myself and I have no desire to hang with people that judge and talk shit on me behind my back. The three of us, along with the person that told me they were talking about me, had all 4 been really close the past couple of years, and me intentionally distancing myself has kind of broken up that friend group a bit. I'm honestly starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong here.

I say I'm sick so I can leave work (which I really shouldn't have), then I pull up outside BC's house and he gets in my car and says we gotta wait for the guy to get there. The guy gets there and BC gets in and gets out and comes back in my car- he says he gave my $ to him and he's going to CVS to grab the script. After sitting in my car a whole hour, a friend shows up to give BC $ that he owes him.  He gets back in my car. I keep asking him to text the guy but he says he won't answer his phone. I can't tell who he's texting. His phone is dying so he runs inside to grab his charger. After a bit, I notice BC is nodding out. He says it's his xanax. Bullshit. I see a text on his phone when he's nodded out that says ""90 for black"" so I'm like, yep. He stole my $ and bought himself some H. I stubbornly refuse to leave. We sat in my car for a total of almost 2 and a 1/2 hours before I couldn't stand it anymore. His bullshit.  

Worst of all is right after I leave, I text my main connect hoping refill day is Monday as it should be (he had a heart attack last weekend but is OK and home now- they put stents in.) He pretty much eludes to him not getting his monthly Oxy script anymore by texting, ""I'm not planning for anything right now"" and when I ask him to call to explain he refuses, says maybe later and, ""Just not going to stress out because you are I can't do that any more you have to relax."" I asked, ""you can't do what anymore?"" And he said, ""stress"".  I mean, I do stress when refill day is later than it should be but he didn't even tell me a day! Do they not give opiates to people after heart attack?? He's been getting them for a decade! 

I'm terrified he's not going to get his script anymore. And that I am so fucked. I only know him and that asshole BC. My heart is pounding out of my chest. I'm so sick and another fucking blizzard is hitting this weekend and I feel like I can't breathe.  I could barely drive home after he sent those texts to me.

Then i moves to dihydrocodeine and codeine phosphate - DHC was superior, phosphate more pure as it’s straight to morphine - but lasts 3 hours and ceiling seemed to be 450mg or so

DHC, 240mg + was a good dose and redoes no probs, americans arents exp with DHC i know, it feels like heroin but weaker obv, 400mg will nod your balls off. 

1 dhc
2 tramadol 
3 codeine 

lastly, i finally tries oxy, and it was garbage to me.
I would eat 20mg and snort 5mg lines until i got wherever and it was just stimulating and just buzzy and euphoric - it’s for ppl who wanna get shit done on opiates - i want the nod and not move - for the price, suuuuch a let down man

i would progress to eating a full 40mg and snort up to 20mg... nah fuck them
and their price. Oxy for me the most overrated opiate known in this world.

drugs i feel are amazing i’ve never tried (bear in mind i never shoot up so maybe oxy shot is amazing)

I’ve been using ECP heroin for a few years off and on and my ROA has been IV for almost exactly a year now and I’ve never had this happen before. This dope I’ve been getting lately, every time I shoot it during the rush my heart starts POUNDING really hard and really fast, and my hands are uncontrollably shaking. It happens every time and lasts for about a minute or two. Otherwise it feels like regular dope, I’m not really wired or anything like I would be on an upper. I’ve shot meth before and never had my heart beating or the shaking like that either but I’ve never shot any other uppers so can’t really compare it...

And as an aside I did ask my dboy about it but he’s not the one bagging, he said he’s trying to find out what it’s cut with from the dude he gets it from though.

So I guess my questions are: has anyone experienced this before? And does anyone have any idea what it could be cut with? And/or is it a bad idea to keep using this particular batch? Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out",1523663307.0

Long story short my buddy said he would take me to the spot if I paid the Uber, so we get there and everyone is sold out. Now he is pissed because he has to get back to work, half an hour before I do. He gives me his money and gives me his plugs info. This guy Is my coworkers husband, honestly one of the nicest guys I’ve met in a long time. He’s a decent bit older then her but hey they have a kid and seem really happy so who am I to judge. 

Anyways I made sure it was cool if I hit her up when I wasn’t with him and he said that was fine because he can’t always get stuff for me with his schedule. Dude has never charged me a fee to middle and has fronted his money to pick up from his people and deliver to me at work before. 

So this particular blue plug is this black chick that gets to me at the bp I’m waiting at she honestly was cute as fuck too, but I would have said fuck it and gone back to work since it was getting late but my buddy was covering for me on lunch and my boss wasn’t there. 

She gives me three blues for 85 which was cool, and they were mbox 30mg. They were suuuuper light colored blue like so light they almost looked white. They were a smidgeon scuffed up but I assumed they were handled. 

I went to the bathroom and railed one after my Uber dropped me back at work, crushed up on a bill and to my surprise they were softer then the pink 10 k’s that I had been getting from the pharmacy (which are my personal favorite), they still required some pressure to crush but they crushed easier then any other blues I’ve had. They tasted right lovely drip and provided a nice euphoric oxy buzz. Talkative a little energetic.l, but not as amped as really energizing Kratom can be. 

Now when I get home from work I load up 1 full one and the bigger half from breaking a second and load it up for a shot. There was veeerry little residual left in the spoon and the water was very light blue. And there was a veeery nice rush that I got that I was not expecting, because I have shot a 218s and as that aren’t 30s too, the rush I remembered was not nearly as good.

 I’m not sure if my tolerance was fucked at the time from banging d’s and h and it just didn’t touch it, but I have been doing heroin and d’s and any anything I can get my hands on lately, and I’m pretty much back where I was at back then. 

It was a pretty strong rush that was better then the shitty heroin I got from my other middle on Tuesday. I was mad I wasted my money on that short lasting fenty trash so I decided to get blues because I could afford a few and i knew that the 3 over a couple hours would get me a euphoric high as opposed to getting fent bullshit again. 

Now my question is do the m boxes I got sound like sniffing and shooting experiences you all have had with them as well? The softness and intensity of the rush was indicative of something like fent but the high was all oxy. Very euphoric not sedating.

You guys are some of the only people I relate to sometimes I swear, something about how we think. I was using heavy back in 2010-2016 and a little in 2017. Got in when the skys were blue 30mg at a time for only 10 bucks.  Lost two jobs from showing up high, lost my girlfriend of 3 years for the same reasons (for the best now), ended up in 15k debt from using $200 a day up my nose. Destroyed my reputation. Good fucking times. The best of times I can remember. My old running buddy is sober and won't talk to me these days, don't blame him.  Today I am sober. Haven't used the real good stuff since august 2015, been relapsing on fake blues and U4 powder once a month until December 2017. My guys... I graduated, got sober, got my dream job that I work full time and actually enjoy, and its got me on track to be making 100k by 2020 as long as I don't fuck up and show up High one day right? I feel nothing different. Sure physically I don't need anything but mentally it is still completely there. I still want to sniff dope and eat pussy 24/7 like a fucking degenerate. I learned that wearing a button down shirt tucked in, along with glasses instead of contacts, makes me look fucking presentable and non-threatening as fuck and I'm living a really weird (to me) normal middle class life now. Idk how I ended up here. I don't have anyone else to talk to about my situation. Just wanted to vent I guess. You guys get it... Shoot/Sniff one for me. Shit I couldn't find it anyway if I wanted to.

She finally saw it and took it from me and said a super quiet thanks and sped off. As I was walking away though a man called me over.

I ended up needing another surgery 8 years later to remove the screws they put on the first time. They broke inside my arm. So I received a morphine drip in recovery.

God damn life was good. 

We were fuckin best friends. Pills wouldn’t tear us apart. No shot. But we slowly began to resent each other, it wasn’t very appearant, but looking back now. It’s obvious. We began only hangin out if we were trynna get “jammed”, and if one didn’t have money, they weren’t invited. Then, we started stealing shit to ease the pain. Blowing percs  before we stepped onto the football field. Blowing percs before the parties we thru. After s year of usage, it’d be weird if we weren’t high. I would lie to my best friends.

Our thoughts really do seem to create a reality.

I've been living in such a negative frame of mind lately and it seems to just make everything worse! 
(Well I mean I guess duh lol) 

But seriously though, so much of this is mental: 
Like how we will be withdrawing our balls off, in such a shitty head space and yet once we have the relief in our hands it's like the symptoms seemingly disappear.

Or like how when you know you'll get to score soon. Or even worse when you know you can't score again.

For me it's like I never feel the ""last bag"" if I don't know when the next ""fix"" is.

Or how the week prior to rehab I could not feel high for the life of me because I was too damn stressed about the pending mental and physical doom of detox.

So that being said I'm really trying to use this principle to be more positive and make sobriety a tiny teeny bit easier.

Idk it's hard as fuck. Obviously these drugs fuck with our chemical makeup and how we think and react. 
Yet yesterday I had this moment where I just genuinely wanted nothing to do with dope or getting high. I did the bare minimum amount to stay well and usually this is hard af for me because I am so use to obsessing over my use and feeling normal. 

But again yesterday my head was above water all day. I wasn't necessarily positive but I wasn't dwelling in negative either. It was bearable.
I keep busy and just was so turned off by the idea of getting high. It's like my brain finally has made a connection that getting High and continuing to use= pain and misery.

Bleh. 

Just random thoughts from my mind.

I ran out early last month and landed myself right in the heat of withdrawal when my dad visited from 18 hours away. He drove 18 hours to spend 3 days with me, drunk and withdrawing, and I completely ruined our visit. 

I had good intentions to do better with this refill. I have a 7 day pill box. I cut them into halves and set out my weeks worth. 

Then that weeks worth ran out and I kept dipping. I'm right back up to a dosage that's triple my prescribed daily amount. The worst part of this refill is my doc cut a pill a day so I am already working with 30 less than normal. 

I still have half my script left but Idk how long that will last. The kicker is I'm not even enjoying them. Usually I'm active and energetic when I take my oxy but I had the flu 2 weeks ago and my body has just changed. I've slept all day every day this week. I feel stupid and sick on them. Why do I keep redosing? 

I can't let myself sit here and go through wd this weekend cause that would seriously suck for my family, but come Monday, I'll have all day all week to deal with the effects. 

If I can stick to my dosing schedule I'll have at least 40 left on Monday. Even if I go to the excess I'll still have a weeks worth left of my script. I think it will help the wd knowing I'm sitting on pills. I won't feel so desperate. I can start taking then the week before my refill.

Firstly, anything that will potentiate Oxycodone so that a lower dose is required.

Secondly, drug combinations (such as benzos) that add to the experience. 

I really value the opinion of this community and the knowledge that lies within. This is why I am asking opinions over just browsing potentiator forums.

Background: we are habitual users with a daily habit of anywhere from a half to a whole G on a typical day (and we snort it). Anything we get we split down the middle. We take turns buying it for the day but it isn't quite 50/50, I buy more than she does, and usually get a greater amount than she does when she's the one purchasing. Because of this I feel that I'm doing more to support our habit than she does. 

But here's the argument: I'm currently (and newly) unemployed but I receive a pretty decent inheritance check every 2 weeks and I'm the sole buyer for us until that money we budgeted for our habit is gone(typically anywhere from 5-8 days), at which point she takes over until the next check comes. 

She is also unemployed but doesn't receive a check like me, so shes always finding new and exciting ways to generate money (and no, she doesn't trick or Rob people for it in any capacity).

Her most recent hustle, and probably the most clever IMO, was approaching people and asking if they can help her with a bachelorette party scavenger hunt that she has until Saturday to complete (today is Thursday). One of the tasks is that she has to get a minimum of $50 in donations from strangers (from any multitude of ppl, she isn't  asking 1 person to donate $50 themselves) . 

To further legitimize her ruse so as not to appear like a scam she tells the ""donator"" that she has to get a pic with them and the $ and have them initial her scavanger hunt paper to ""prove she isn't cheating"" by using her own money to accomplish this task. Pretty scandalous and quite clever right?

Anyway obviously her way takes a lot more effort than simply getting a check, but her way also generates less funds and takes a lot longer than my way. It took about 3-4 hours to come up with $60, which is really the bare minimum amount we need to get enough for us to split and be Ok for the day. 

She says that even though were typically only getting enough to get by  when she's the one buying that her contribution is actually worth more than mine bc of the amount of time/energy, and thought that goes in to her plans. 

I disagree. 

So we are giving the argument to you good people to decide once and for all who's doing more for our habit- my greater amounts with almost no effort, or her smaller but acceptable bags for us to split.

TLDR: I spend more money on H for us to split 50/50 than she does with little to no effort via a bi-weekly inheritance check/ once that $ is gone she takes over and buys smaller bags but with great effort and time consuming plays. Who's making the greater contribution to our needs?


Addt'l info on her scavanger hunt play: to try to encourage people to ""donate"" more $ for the game she says that all the money generated is going towards the honeymoon for the fictitious couple and that whomever comes up with the most money by the hunts and will receive a call bonus and a day spa certificate and whomever had the largest single person donation will also receive a cash prize.


I've included pictures of the pretend scavanger hunt rules and tasks she created at her request to show the people she's asking for donations from so you can see how much effort she put in to this plan.",1523599116.0

D-Boy said he could hook me up with sum for $60, because his boys might want to cop some acid from me later. my boy pulls up, hands me a baloon. give him my cash. I get my ""dope"". 5 minutes walking away from the car I get into my stairwell. open the baloon and what do I see? 

MOTHER FUCKING PINK SHARDS. 

I hit him up ""Hey... this is crystal...."" 

No reply. 

I dump it out. scale it. .5 

$60 for a half gram of some bullshit drug I have no desire to put into my body. the EXACT opposite of what I wanted... I'm just... what the fuck? I have to try to sell or trade this shit or flush it and I'm out $60. 


-----> End Rant.

TL;DR : Dboy says could get me something for $60 (assumed .5 of tar, would get me through the next few weeks the ways I use), dboy shows up with bag, was really a .5 of pink meth. Dboy ghosts. I'm out $60. popped my last half a bar so I can get to sleep tonight. I feel defeated, cheated, angry, and sad all in one and it is all my fault. caught between sobering up and finding better connects or both. 

UPDATE: So he told me his phone died yada yada yada, says he'll give me a bag of tar to fix his fuck up, then I mention it's pink and it will sell easy and he asks me to sell it. after I told him I don't have customers for this shit, this scumbag says

""Manipulate them. tell them you tried it and it has you on another level. might make some customers and wanna start selling.""

... and in that moment, I was no longer mad. I hope this guy changes before his ways catch up to him. I have a new connect that is as reliable as my own family. happy nods everyone and have a nice day, sending positive vibes. ",1523598963.0

I’ve been on 16mg of Suboxone (the white half moons + 155) daily for the past 9 months, and to be honest, I’m sick and tired of all the doctor appointments, making up reasons why I need a certain time of day off of work, telling friends and family that I see a psychiatrist when it’s really a Suboxone clinic... I just want off the Suboxone.

I’ve read some really conflicting information on what it’s like coming off of Suboxone; some say it’s the worst opioid withdrawal I’ll ever experience, and some say it’s quite easy. Before I got on Suboxone, I was physically dependent on oxymorphone. If I couldn’t get my hands on that, it was oxycodone. Always something, every single day just to not be sick.

Has anyone ever came off of Suboxone on their own, without the ridiculous “3-4 year weaning” process these Suboxone doctors put people on? I wouldn’t want to just up and quit cold turkey, but what do you all think it would be like after 9 months or so of two 8mg tablets a day? How fast could I wean myself down to nothing? Will it be agonizing?

I've been snorting pills/heroin for the last 7 years. The past 2 years have been strictly h and between. 5 and a gram a day. I switched to the needle 2 months ago because my breathing had gotten so bad that I couldn't walk up stairs without being out of breath. Also, I got tired of living with the ""death rattle "" at nights for the past year. I used to use a netti pot fairly regular, but was always shocked that NOTHING ever came out.

Fast forward to now...

I have a major sinus infection and I'm blowing ridiculous amounts of stuff out of my nose. However, what has me concerned is seeing a thin rubber like membrane that I'm also blowing out in small pieces. (Since its coming out of my nose, its actually pretty big). They best description would be a rubbery thin film thats the thickness of a condom and you have to actually tear apart to break up.

I'm assuming that what this is, is my sinuses had gotten a coating of drugs that over time had formed a rubbery film? If this is the case, it would explain why A. I never got anything out after using the netti pot... and B. Why my lungs had gotten so bad so quick. My sinuses no longer were absorbing anything because it basically had something similar to a condom that was covering everything that the dope would have normally attached to?

My questions are this...

1st. Has anyone else experienced this?

2nd. Does my theory seem plausible?

3rd. Any idea how to get rid of this? The only time I ever get this stuff out is when I have a sinus infection. The last SI mainly had this film coming out of the right nostril and now, it's the left nostril. (I'm getting regular heavy mucus out of the other nostril).

4th. Can you think of any other possible reason/thing this is? 

I'd love to go to the doctor, but I've basically bankrupted my family and I don't have insurance. So unfortunately, seeing a doctor is out of the question unless this becomes serious. ",1523595242.0

Anyway, she charged $10 for the 18's which is a great price for oxy  imho. Well when she got upgraded to the 27's she left the price the same - $10 for basically 30mg of oxy. IMHO you gotta be a fucking idiot to turn that down but fuck if I can get anyone interested in them.

I've been on Vivitrol for about 14 days and its pretty terrible stuff IMO. INSANE insomnia and a strange kind of crippling depression and agoraphobia-ish type anxiety i never had before, along with other more minor physical symptoms. (Pain and stomach issues.)

Because I can't handle this shit, I've been trying to research a way to break through that infernal shot, to little avail. Been reading about how Suboxone/bupe can bypass it, so naturally i acquired some and insufflated 4mg.

I was quite underwhelmed, and though i doubt it was placebo for various reasons, I did manage to feel a teeny bit less anhedonic (i can actually talk without a flat affect, and leave my house--seriously.. I wish the psychiatrist would've warned me about these issues (i did ask), but the way he presented it, Vivitrol is as harmless as chamomile tea.)

Digging online reveals that most people who have success breaking through vivitrol do so by IVing the bupe/Suboxone..usually in like 1-2mg amounts.

I only have Suboxone (no subutex) so I'm a little wary of risking putting myself through PWD (considering the naloxone) though is that even really an issue when you get down to the fundamental pharmacokinetics?

Shouldn't the residual naltrexone perhaps block the naloxone? I know for me, bupe itself doesn't block naloxone like it does for many folks who IV Suboxone. (I had a bad experience IVing it some years ago, so first hand experience in that regard.) Really tempted to try it though, as pathetic and desperate as that may sound.

Also I've seen tramadol mentioned but much less info seems available on that. I'd appreciate it if anyone has any information on that, or anything else that would displace the damn naltrexone on my mu-opioid happy spots.

Are there any other methods to screw with the injection itself, apart from cutting oneself open? Like some kind of way to metabolize the gel release thing faster than usual, perhaps some kind of ass cheek exercises combined with grape fruit juice and hydroxycut? (I joke.)

But seriously, is there any way to nullify this thing? You'd think they'd (the drug company) create a way to reverse the shot in case of emergency adverse symptoms.

When you take an opiate with the intention of relaxing/nodding/etc, what is your preferred setting? Do you prefer to be alone so you can enjoy the high with no disruption and do your own thing, or do you prefer to be with other people in a social setting? I'll usually go over my brothers house and hangout for the night, that way I can have someone to talk too and smoke with during the high, Although, I have been wanting to enjoy an opiate high alone recently.

Shit posts regarding my “habit(s)” etc, make me feel normal... from the feedback. So, last Thursday I tossed my guy $50. He’s a middle, but kind of a friend. We’ve gone hunting a few times together, played pool, he’s chilled at my place and vice versa. He’s on pain management, relative of a really good friend. He likes to play games sometimes.... “I’ll be good at 2pm tomorrow “. You call at 1:00, no answer. 3 days later you get a text... “are you coming to grab these or what?” Than he bitches you out for not being there at 2pm. However..... if he gives you a day and a time and you show up, he’s fucking pissed you didn’t call before you came. Yah, it’s like that. Today is day 7 of waiting for what I needed 7 days ago, his uncle has been sick and actually passed yesterday. “He will call me when it’s good, don’t call him”. Sad part is, his uncle really is sick and I assume did pass away. I did the dt’s already, took my normal kratom daily. I’m nearly off the kratom now too, though I still feel shitty after an ounce a day for months.  I’ve really been keeping my nose clean the last 18 or so months, 11-12of which I was on methadone. Stuck to daily kratom and that’s been it. I decided to dabble with the fucking roxy again, I probably even chipped successfully in all reality. But the bullshit and games are the same every time. I met a guy that was laboring for one of my professional contacts yesterday, I cracked a joke about pills..... he says, “My wife gets the little pink ones, Christ she probably has 4 or 500 sitting around.

I have only tried cold-medicine with codeine before, around 100mg 3 times, and it was fairly enjoyable. I have also been addicted to alcohol for the past 2 years (not very heavy use but still every day).


Therefore, i bought 5 30mg IR oxycodone a couple of months back from a guy with a script, but I have been unsure whether I want to go down this road or not. In my mind I would use occasionally for as long as I could until I ran out of money, in which case I would end it (unless doing opiates changed my outlook on life).


In the best case scenario, I would be able to use opiates for a while, possibly become addicted and maybe have some sort of revelation about life. In this scenario, finding a purpose in life would far outweigh the negative effects of addiction, as I would be alive instead of dead (since most normal people hold life above all others, it wouldnt matter if i were addicted as long as i was alive)


In the worst case scenario, I would use opiates, fall in love with them and become addicted, run out of money, and then still not have the courage to off myself, and I would be stuck in a ""mental prison"" which according to what I've read here for the past 3 years is 1000x worse than regular depression.


What I'm looking for is people who have been in a similar situation who could shed some light on what they did and how it worked out.


Please refrain from posting ""it gets better"", ""you mean so much to X and Y"", "" just get help bro lol"" etc.. I've had my dose of those messages while browsing for suicide methods and statistics. If anything, they make me feel worse, because it is this ""fake compassion to look good in front of others"" that is a major factor in my negative mood.

So, how can you tell what your current tolerance is and if you can safely redose.

Say for example; I take 40mg of OC at 2pm (crushed/parachuted) Then at 3pm I snort another 20mg. Then 3.30pm, another 20mg dose. 

Say then at 4.30pm I'm feeling high but would like to be higher. How do I know what a safe amount would be to take. I've never had a problem and my doses have probably maxed at 160mg throughout the day. 

The only guide I go by is obviously if I'm feeling good but also measure heart rate. If that drops below 60bpm, I tend to slow it down. Is the dose response curve fairly wide if you are resonably experienced?

Once every few weeks to once every couple months. I decided to buy some kratom from my local head shop. Honestly it's really boring to me. A couple grams gives me a mood boost for the rest of the day. 7-12g very very very slightly relaxes me and makes me kinda talkative. No euphoria though. Feels like it wants to be an opiate but obviously isn't lol. Anyways I noticed something. I took about 3g in the morning (noon is my morning time) and went about my day. Hadn't used opiates in a month or two. I got ahold of a nice 30mg of hydrocodone my usual dose. Ate it with a semifull stomach. It kicked me in my ass something similar to the first time using MDMA euphoria. Used a couple times since and I've gotten nothing like that. I'm going to take a couple weeks break and try it with kratom again. I was just wondering if anybody else has had this experience or can confirm this happens. I thought it would have the opposite effect. Would taking kratom when the highs going away be effective? I'm just really curious as to how it can potentiate euphoria,1523523756.0

My doses are anywhere from 30mg to 60mg depending on if I've been using daily or been taking breaks. Anyways. Even on super heavy doses now and with breaks the euphoria has gotten really weak. Only lasts like an hour and even my nods are getting weak. So I've switched to oxy. While oxy is way better for my money as I'm taking 15mg-20mg for a similar if not cheaper price than the hydrocodone and getting the old euphoria I was missing, I'm getting no nod at all. The nod and euphoria really went amazing together. I don't want to take a whole 30 and get nauseous just to attempt to nod. Is there anything you guys recommend for me to get a nod? Will like .5mg - 1mg of xanax do it for me? I take about 3mg-4mg to get high on xanax and that's a pretty weak one to me. With no tolerance I can't feel a bar so .5mg to 1mg is like nothing to me. My blackout range on xanax is about 6mg. I can take 5mg and remember everything and not be too crazy. I know those doses sound crazy I don't know why I have such a high natural tolerance to xanax but I do. Sorry about explaining my Xanax tolerance here I was hoping it'd help. Is there another opiate you would recommend to achieve the old hydrocodone effects? I don't want to do heroin again I don't really like it. Maybe what we have here is just really shitty.

I’ve not touched anything else in two years and other than subs I’ve gotten my life together.

Do the opiates stay in your body or just get flushed out since they can't stick to your receptors?  Can you go ahead and take suboxone the next day and keep on with your maintenance or do you have to wait until withdrawal to start sub again even though you never felt the opiates and they were never able to bind to your receptors? 

I was under the impression suboxone wipes all the opiates out of your system, and unless you wait long enough after your last suboxone (24-72 hours) dose you will not be able to feel anything from opiates.  If that is true then do the opiates that you tried to relapse with even stick to receptors in your body or do they just get flushed out as if you hadn't taken a thing and you ended up just ""wasting"" pain pills?

Lately i made the stupid decision to use again. Thought i could just have a little nostalgic fun with heroin again. I scored 0.1 just for a shot or two, sounded like a good idea at the time. And ive had such great control with my drinking and weed lately i thought id be fine.

Well time flew and 5 days later i was still using, at 0.25g a day. Woke up yesterday morning and felt pretty crappy, by some miracle i woke up with a bit of clarity though; and got rid off all my rigs and called my 'dealer' (who is a friend first and foremost luckily; i only met him after 2 years of clean time, we just go to the gym together) and asked him to stop selling to me; he said he was relieved and was worried i was gonna turn to shit again. Swore he wouldn't no matter what i said.
I can cold cop in open air markets here but the gear is usually awful and even in my peak of addiction id avoid it unless i had to.

Dont take your clean time for granted, i did and nearly fucked it all up. The battle isnt over either but im insistent on staying the fuck away from it. I nearly lost my sobriety from heroin, and in doing so risked everything that's important to me.

I know every exchange and shift is different, but we are all volunteers who spend our evenings here after work to help our community. Almost all of us actively use drugs, we just can't usually be super open about it. We love each and every one of you the way you are.

We try our best to source enough free Narcan and other supplies, but more often than not we run out before the shift ends. This sometimes causes our visitors to get pretty irate, as if we are hiding it from you. Trust me, I'd rather you have Narcan than not.

We're always there to help you with anything, even if it's a referral to a medical tent, shelter, Suboxone clinics, etc. Just know that we don't know everything. We don't always know what syringe will be best for what drug, so please don't get upset with us or think we are being judgemental just because we don't  know the best way to IV heroin into your neck or femoral. We love getting suggestions on how we can better serve the community, so please don't be shy :). 

A lot of us have to write down everything we give away, so please also bare with us if you are here for a large pickup and we have to ask you to repeat the list a few times because we can't always understand.

Last but certainly not least, if you have some spare time, I HIGHLY recommend getting involved with your local exchange. I've met the best people here.",1523503060.0

Lastly. If you don't have a job/career, have daily responsibility, no bills or on welfare or any kind of social situation where if u wanted to you could sleep in your living room for weeks at a time doing nothing and nothing will go south in your life, you have NO EXCUSE to not quit if that is what u want to truly do. You KNOW how to do it, but put saftey valves in place to allow urself to give in. Turn your phone off. Keep it off. Deal with the withdrawals , don't check your Facebook, don't allow anyway to contact or someone to contact u regarding using. Give your  laptop to someone or do whatever it takes to separate yourself from the people that will be your rope when your sick as a dog, depressed, and worst of all, beginning to let the user part of your brain plan a justified relapse. If you relapse out of just withdrawl , you need to get some professional help , as you don't want to quit, at least not enough to do it unsupervised.

My post on here helped me realize how much I was enabling him, and shortly after I gave him a 60-day notice to move out. I also did a walk through of the house (with our mom, who had been deep in denial). There were syringes everywhere and it was pretty traumatic to see how bad things were.

Anyway, the move out date (March 30) came and went. I didn't file an eviction because he did open up to our mom about his heroin use and said he wanted to get help. He went in for an evaluation and got state-funded insurance. He supposedly detoxed on his own at home and will be starting outpatient treatment. 

While there has been some progress, I am concerned he is not really serious about treatment and not totally convinced he is clean. He still refuses to respond to my text messages or calls, has not attended any meetings, and declined inpatient treatment even though he is eligible for it. He seems more concerned about people finding out about his addiction than working on his sobriety.

If you shoot up in a public bathroom, clean your shit please.","So I work in a chain drug store. The area around here is really rampant with heroin and other opiates since it's one of the more pure areas in the country and its pretty cheap.

I live in a bit smaller of a town, but I work in a pharmacy. We sell syringes to those who ask, and I don't have a problem because I am an ex-user or all different drugs so I know it's better to give them clean ones than to share or use old ones. THey are gonna do it one way or another, so I sell them.

Anyways, one night some undesirable looking people come back to the pharmacy, ask if there is a bathroom, and I tell them where it is. Immediately I know something is up, especially because at least 2 or more people came in for syringes right after another and that isn't a common occurence.

I go into the bathroom, I can't really do anything but a kid is in the stall, sitting, I hear a zipper and his pants aren't down.. so he clearly aint taking a shit lol. I leave and come back later to inspect the bathroom and I figured I would find some baggie, a syringe or cap or something.

I don't see anything, but then as I am about to leave I look at the toilet seat cover holder and THERES A FUCKING METAL SPOON IN IT!!

Seriously, what the fuck guys?! I've seen people leave cotton, caps, baggies, BUT A FUCKING SPOON? First of all the idiot is burning all of the fillers and bad shit into their solution and putting it in their veins.. but to leave a spoon man? Come on...

So I told my manager, the police were called and they inspected the videos and saw all of the people. They knew who the kids were ( small town), what car they were now in, who they were with and knew that they had drugs on them now. 

So basically, this kid not only disrespected society and other people by leaving his fucking drug spoon in a public bathroom, but ALSO made it that much easier to find him and his friends and bust them.

Good job!

Please... clean up your shit and be courteous to the rest of us, you're just making things worse and causing more trouble for yourself to get caught.

Thank you and be safe all.

Edit: I’m
Not understanding how it’s My fault that they left their shit there .
Somehow IM the bad person ? Seriously ?

Edit 2: man you guys are relentless . Maybe just don’t be stupid and be respectful and there wouldn’t be any problems to begin with ?
Edit 3: I want to make it clear that no one was arrested from this situation . They can’t prove who left it , they already were aware of who these kids were and all the info about them . This is basically a warning for everyone , yeah maybe i should have not mentioned the spoon but if I did this Then there are thousands of more examples just like this , I’m basically trying to tell you all to not do this shit or your running the risk of it happening to you and getting pinched

FINAL EDIT : ** You know what? It is my fault. You guys are right. I completely forgot that those in the middle of addiction don't take any responsibility for themselves and blame every one else for their problems and what happens to them. Never THEIR fault, they have an addiction! It's my fault he left anything there! It's my fault he shooting pills/dope in the bathroom and leaving a ton of residue of a random substance behind for some kid to find. It's my fault the police know who they are and what they are up to.

B - for pills or H, if I have time at home to prep, I will make little foil envelopes of pre crushed goods. Portion out the doses and fold them up into perfect little packets. Put them in my pocket and head back to said bathroom, open up, and use a rolled up post it note as a tooter.

Whenever I take my drug test at my regular probation department, they just dump my pee out and don’t send it to a lab. But I’m worried that if I take a piss test at my TAIP assessment that they will send it to a lab.
I have prescriptions for everything I would test positive for, but I’ve been using dope (which would pop for opiates) but I have a codeine cough syrup prescription which would explain why I tested positive for opiates.

     I sit Starring at nothing and... but for a moment living the murky past.  The watercolor smudges of cumulative remembrance,  the eternal “rightness” of these life dreams.  Mothers milk warm vignettes of ice cream grinning love, eternal and fundamentally right.   When I Focus hard enough though a snake oil memory fraudulent and poisonous beckons.  Oh but Those blissful floating  hours of mirage nirvana....and yet....

     I know self sabotage.  I became a lie.  Like water I wove myself around every possible outcome making up each answer as the questions formed.  I taught myself to be a mirror.  I am what you want to see.  Blank slate freedom. 

     ...but this was a different freedom. A special kind of Straight jacket limiting.  I was fastened to a singular pivot point wavering only when the phone went unanswered or the money ran out or my lies grew too cancerous to hold back.  For in Shedding honesty, becoming the essential binary, on or off,  the weight of daily expectations was lifted.  I gave up everything that mattered and in return a phantom quickly replaced it, one purpose far more disruptive and consuming than the routine of living.  I became the singularity before the Big Bang.   
Potential energy and limitlessly compressed weight focused and concentrated on escaping itself.  Eventually the unbelievable explosion bright and white hot showed me my true face. And I could have been any stranger in any town.  I was a lie.  Whole and complete.  The amazing nothing.  

The reckless precision and blind devotion of living the same day over and over is something to never forget.  The sirens call is distant though her song will always be a part of me.  As some dead man said ""stare into the abyss and the abyss stares back.""  There is some truth to that but I guess I was able to turn away mostly intact.  My abyss is a self inflicted sickness that I hope to never forget.

As my girlfriend and I were pulling into our parking lot, since we’re fortunate enough to have a first-floor apartment straight down a sidewalk clearly visible from near the entrance, we saw a police officer walking from what appeared to be our apartment door, and instead of pulling into our clearly labeled parking spot that correlates with our apartment number, we got the hell out of there with the gram we still had with us. Oddly and luckily enough, the last time my computer was in need of repair, I was invited to take it to BestBuy to have it fixed for free on my grandpa’s three-computer repair plan on which he had only registered one computer; and since I never decided to remove the BestBuy sticker with his name on it, my grandparents ended up informing me that they had received a call from the police department asking them if they had recently had a laptop stolen, as they had just come across one with his name on it during the execution of a search warrant, which confirmed my suspicion that I was lied to by my apartment management when he told me I didn’t need to worry about any police involvement and that they had indeed obtained a warrant that quickly. While they left the syringes, spoons, empty prescription bottles not in my name, and lots of other illegal materials, they did decide to confiscate all the foils, my bongs, pipes, about half of my remaining recently prescribed gabapentin out of the bottle (?), my fucking cat and his crate (????!!!!), and ALL MY KRATOM:(. I’ve spent the better part of the last two hours searching high and low for a kratom site that will ship to me ASAP and that takes card instead of just bitcoin bullshit, with no luck whatsoever, which SUCKS seeing as I’ll be in withdrawals soon and don’t know anyone at all irl who uses kratom (or even opiates for that matter) that could help me out with that. Does anyone know how long to expect before they’ll get an arrest warrant, or if they might even decide not to worry about it since they didn’t find any actual possession of narcotics? Does anyone know where my cat might be if he isn’t at the humane society or animal welfare, and if they’ll charge us anything to reclaim him being that he’s microchipped in my girlfriend’s name? Lastly, I was just approved literally two days ago for a new apartment but have only paid the application fees, and the $200 deposit to hold the apartment so it won’t be leased to someone else. All we still have to do is deal with renters insurance and make the pet deposits and can then presumably get our keys and start moving in out stuff and getting it out of the current apartment that we need to vacate by the end of the week. Does anyone think that this eviction will somehow have any effect on the approval status of our applications to the new apartment? Thanks to everyone for any replies and helpful information, guessing, or just sympathetic thoughts, all is appreciated right now.

8bfap8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8bfap8/frustration/,10,https://redd.it/8bfap8,AnnieAznable,Frustration.,"A little back story here - When I was i was in 6th grade, i found out i had kyphosis and scoliosis theough that really awkward (but clearly helpful and effective) test they do in gym class where they look at your spine as you bend. However, the kyphosis and scoliosis was so bad by the time i was diagnosed that a brace or physical therapy was useless. If i didnt get my entire spine, from the base of my neck to my middle back essentially, fused, my spine was going to crush my heart and lungs and slowly kill me. Long story short, got my spinal fusion... only to have the area of the spine that wasnt fused start to curve in WORSE and start crushing my other internal organs. Yet again had to go under the knife to do the entire surgery over again to fuse my entire spine. The second surgery left me with terrible chronic pain - developed fibromyalgia, degenerative disc disease, and severe athritis. 

Needless to say, im in pain management. The doctor who performed my surgeries saw me and gave me whatever pills I needed - vicodin, tramadol, percocet, valium, you name it. But by time Im around 21 years old, he tells me the pain im in makes no sense to him, isnt adding up due to my ""successful"" surgeries, and i dont need to be seen by him any longer. These fucking surgeries made me had to be home schooled in high school for two years because I was in sp much pain I couldnt get myself out of bed most days. I fought to get through my high school years, got through and was able to have a relatively normal college experience, and somehow a pain ridden fucking loser landed my dream job a year out of college. Its a physically demanding job and there is very little if any room for error. But heres the thing - im good at my job and I absolutely love it. Its given me purpose and has brought a new sense of meaning to my life (needless to say im a clinically depressed and anxiety ridden fool. All this shit will do that to a person) and while any other person in my shoes would pick an easier, less taxing on the body job, i cannot and will not do that.

So, Ive been in pain management for going on 3 years now. Started off on butrans patches along with 5mg oxycodone, celebrex, gabapentin, and tizanidine. After two years we got rid of the butrans patch because it just wasnt helping me anymore and i was left with everything else.... and my tolerance for the 5mg oxy is just laughable. When you've been on opioid pain killers since literally 11 years old and are now going on 25... 5mg is nothing at this point, but i know how almost impossible it is to get any sort of assistance or prescription overall from any damn doctor anywhere, whether you have chronic pain or dentist work or cancer or whatever the fuck! So believe me when I say I am lucky to get anything at all. I get 120 pills a month to take 4 times daily, but when youre doubling, tripling what youre supposed to be taking, 120 pills disappear in the blink of an eye. Got my script tomorrow, gabe my mom around 5, gave my roommaten 20 of them to stash and hide for me to dispense out to me when im out, and had at the rest of them. Took far too many to get through just two days of work and took way too many once I got home and could relax... and thats putting it lightly. 

Im frustrated. Im embarrassed. Im scared. Im hopeless.... I just dont even know what to do anymore. I have an appointment with my pain managment doc in aboit 3 weeks. My new insurance plan sucks and wont cover these appointments so im paying $300 out of pocket to get meds that my body has grown a tolerance for and dont do anything for me anymore. 

I guess im posting because i just feel like theres something fucking wrong with me and I feel far too dependent on these damn opioids... im 25 years old and am on the same pill regimen as my 79 year old grandma. I know I need my doses raised, but im terrified to try and address it and because of being so young, im scared of saying or doing any damn thing that would even remotely think of labeling me as a drug adict. But these drugs make it possible for me to work my dream job and have a somewhat normal life with my friends, family, and endeavors plus or minus some things. 

I don't even know what to do. Any advice or even just some positive vibes would be much appreciated. The pain has been so bad today that Ive been popping pills like m&ms, i havent been able to fall asleep and my alarm for work goes off in an hour and a half.

Thanks.",1523432272.0

I use the monkey water method with an oral syringe. So a large part of the IV ritual has already been a part of my use. I always measure out and write down every single dose along with the total at the end of the day. This is every day for the past year. About 10 doses of 20mg per day all tracked. Now I am very much considering switching to IV. My only worry is that I will eventually end up using a lot more than I anticipated and ""falling off the deep end"". But this worry only stems from what I've heard and read from others about switching to IV immediately being the worse decision to make. I do have faith in myself that's its possible. For a person like me, who's been able to use the same amount daily for the past year, is switching to IV and maintaining the same strict use schedule actually realistic and achievable? Or am I fooling myself?

EDIT: Thanks for the insight guys. Buddy had syringes at the ready but I managed to keep away for at least a little while longer. I've gotten the urge to switch a couple times now and I always tell myself to sleep on it first. Once again I woke up glad I didn't.",1523429070.0

Dealer hits me up, sends the infamous “good come thru” text. My heart rate increases and my brain excretes endorphins. I swear this excitement is better than the high. So I hop in my car, run to the bank and take out 150 bucks for 5 blues. Damn could’ve gotten a nice pair of j’s with that money. Ah well, this shits way better. 

Driving to my dealer, fuck, why is my mom calling? ignore, it’ll be a lot easier to chat mom when I’m high. I continue down the road, he’s only 15 minutes away but I swear to god this always feels like hours. I take the right off the highway, and text him I’ll be there in 5. We all kno dealers, that’ll mean I’ll see him in 30. My phone vibrates, a text, maybe it’s him! Dammit, my mom,  “hey son, it’s my birthday! I kno u didn’t forget, 😝 just letting u know!” Fuck! I absolutely did forget. I’ve been withdrawing all day, only thing on my mind is getting high. Fuck it, I’ll still call her when I’m well, talking is difficult when I’m not.

Adam is in his early 50’s. He’s short 5’5 and he’s disgustingly overweight 300+ pounds. He wears glasses cause he’s blind as a bat with his beedy little eyes. He’s a ginger. Has a raspy high pitched whiny voice. So there’s your description of him lol. Now I’ve met some junkies that are pretty fiendlike but Adam is in a whole other category. 

My boyfriend had known Adam from back in the OC days. Adam’s Dad was one of the biggest pill dealers around here. He got prescribed OC’s the real ones and other pills. I think he also got pills off the web idk but I’ve heard a lot about Adam’s Dad and how cool he was. Nobody knows why he is the complete opposite of his dad. Could’ve been cause he’s an only child and he’s spoiled rotten. His dad passed away years ago and left everything to him. He had a construction business that went to shit cause Adam is a lazy fuck. Basically he blew everything that was left to him and fucked off the business. He used to have an apartment but eventually lost that too cause funds ran out. 

I met Adam in 2016 when my boyfriend and I were in rough spot. We had to move out of my house cause it was being raised for floods and we had no car. My cars clutch blew and I couldn’t afford to get it fixed in a shop so a family friend said he would store my car and help fix it when he had free time. My boyfriend totaled his car. It was just a rough time. One day when we were staying at a friends house our friend Trevor came over. Trevor grew up with Adam and were best friends but it was more because their parents were close. Trevor told us Adam would help us do returns and give us a ride and we obliged. 

Anytime we’ve needed someone to do returns for us or whatever we break people off fairly and we aren’t stingy. Adam realized that, and immediately offered to let us stay at his place and he’ll do more returns for us yada yada. The least amount of work he had to put in to get high the better. We accepted his offer and needed showers so it sounded like a good deal. We pull into his apartments and it’s the same Senior apartments my great grandparents lived in that had just passed away that month. I knew Adam was older but not that old. He then mentions he lives with his mom. I knew how tiny those apartments were and started to regret accepting the offer to stay for the night. We don’t like being burdens on people or anything like that so I felt bad. We climbed the 3 flights of stairs and Adam is huffing and puffing. Surprised he never had a heart attack climbing those stairs. He introduces us to his almost 90 year old mother and I felt so much guilt then. The apartment had no room to walk. Adam’s belongings were everywhere. In the living room there was a small twin bed in the corner that we slept on that night. Adam rushes to his gaming corner. He has a desk with his tv and Xbox one. He sleeps in a Laz-e boy every night with his headset on, drool dripping down his chin, and his rolls hanging over the side of his recliner. He’s got paraphernalia all around his desk. He’s a smoker but still it’s wrong. His mom was so sweet tho. She really enjoyed our company. Her birthday was in a few days and she told me her whole life story. Adam treats her like utter shit. Video games and dope is all he cares about. His mom will try and ask him something and he tells her to shutup or he pretends to listen. My boyfriend and I are uncomfortable and just went to bed. 

So for the next two days we realized just how big of a piece of shit Adam is. He’s supposed to be taking care of his mom but doesn’t. She needed her benzo script filled and he hadn’t filled it in over a week! I eventually took the script and went to fill it myself because she was withdrawing and I couldn’t let it go unfilled for another day. Adam’s car was on a spare tire so we went and paid for a brand new tire on his car for him. We found out why Adam was procrastinating and wouldn’t take us to where we needed to go was because his moms social security check and disability check came that day. This motherfucker takes his mom to the bank cashes her checks and takes ALL the money. He had $750 and was searching for a quarter of black and a quarter of crystal. I was just flabbergasted that someone could do that to someone like their own mother. After he picked up his dope he went and bought himself a dab rig cause he liked dabbing after I showed him how. Then drove to the apartments and told us we could take the car and do whatever just bring it back. We went to the grocery store and my boyfriend got groceries. we remembered it was Adam’s moms birthday and she likes wine so he got her a few nice bottles of wine too. We went to drop the groceries off and filled the fridge up. Adam will literally go to the dollar store for groceries. The less money he has to spend on his moms necessities the more dope money for him. So sad. We gave her the wine and she almost started crying! She said she hasn’t had anything nice in a very long time. 

We didn’t end up staying in the apartment either we slept in Adams car for two more nights. I knew from my great grandparents living there that if the management finds out anyone that’s not on the lease is staying there then the tenants will get evicted. I overheard Adam’s mom worrying and asking Adam what they were going to do but I wasn’t sure what she meant at the time. Well two months later, I’m hanging with Trevor. He pulls up in a U-haul. I ask him what’s up with that? He tells me that he’s spent the last three days busting his ass packing and moving everything out of Adam’s moms apartment, while Adam sat on his ass playing video games. I guess Adam got his mom evicted. They were behind on rent and he wasn’t supposed to be living there. Adam told Trevor he would break him off some dope for helping too and when Adam didn’t Trevor lost it. So he proceeded to use the U-haul for two more days then returned it. I guess Adam and his mom stayed at motel 6 for like two weeks if that. Then they stayed in a shelter but eventually got kicked out because Adam was using. Last I knew, Adam and his mom were living in his little ass car. Dragging her around while he scores dope. Mind you, this was during December so it was freezing outside. I’m sure he was using in front of her too. Hella fucked up. His mom is definitely codependent and shit but she’s 90! She’s got dementia but in the early stage. She needs someone to take care of her. She won’t leave his side tho. ",1523419274.0

It got me thinking about how other then getting a couple hours Of sleep after we r completely exhausted. But other then that we all know during withdrawals sleep alludes all of us but I was wondering if anyone happened to know the scientific reason behind not being able to sleep.


It doesn’t make sense to me. Like every other sickness the human body goes through requires sleep and rest. It’s literally how and when our bodies heal.  But nope not during opiate withdrawals and I want to know why. 

I think i speak for all of us when I say if we could sleep through withdrawals we would prob make it through the w/d more often but alas we don’t have this luxury. 

So does anyone know exactly why this is the case? It sucks that on a normal non withdrawal day if I take even a crumb of a seriquil I’m OUT  for 12 hours and even groggy after that. When I’m sick tho I can take multiple full seriquil and maybe get 4 hours of sleep. 

The god answer is fuck you u did this to yourself now reap the consequences but I really would like the scientific answer as to why we are kept up during withdrawals he’ll if u guys can explain the reasoning behind any of the symptoms we go thru 
-RLS
-Diarrhea
-insomnia
-vomiting 
-anxiety 
-muscle cramps 
-loss of appetite 

If u guys know the scientific reasons behind these symptoms please fill me in!

I'm just reflecting this past weekend and the amount of money I spent in a three day period.

I've been on sub since January and  doing really well so I thought I'd treat myself for just one day (I always tell myself just one day but that never seems to be the case.) So my parents were in Florida last week and I could go to there house to use to avoid my roomate who I didn't want to nod out in front of.

Long story short I took my last 2 mg of sub Wednesday afternoon around two. Bought ten thirties for $350 and waited until around nine am Thursday to blow my first three.. Probably didn't wait long enough since I didn't feel much, but felt more and more as the day went on. I planned on getting back on the sub Friday but that quickly changed so after work I bought another ten pack (350). Went to my paremts empty house proceeded to nod out effectively after doing 8 total.

Again, planned on stopping Saturday but I had two thirties left.. I thought I should just sell them. BUT I  brought them to my half day of work on Saturday and  quicklyfound myself sitting on the toilet and crushing one up. Now I only had one left and knew it wouldn't get me through the rest of the day and didn't want to risk PWDs by taking sub so bought six more after work ($210).

Sunday came around and I took a look at my bank account and it hit me that I spent almost a g in three days ($910). Worth it? Definitely not Thursday, but I'd say yes for Friday and Saturday.

What's the most amount of money you've guys spent in a short amount of time and did you regret it? ",1523410836.0

I have a bunch of old school tales.  I will keep each post short.  So do your thing boys and girls and get ready.  Oh – everything in these stories are complete lies and fabrications or fiction.  One or the other.  I think, maybe ;).

The Boss – A Bad Mother
The boss of the house was Price.  Price was an old school N who was all about business.  He had rules and order to his house and he got his cut from EVERYTHING flowing through from steaks to pussy.  If you broke his rules, you were barred.  Simple as that.  Price’s house wasn’t a trap house.  It was more like a party house or a hang-out.  Old school we would call it an oil joint.  A place where you could buy or sell ANYTHING and either take it home or do it there.

Being white and from the suburbs, I liked the rules and order.  Price made sure that everyone was mostly treated fairly and as safe as possible considering the environment.  I could send my girl to the house without her being harassed or ripped-off.  It’s not that things never got out-of-hand, but mostly things ran smoothly.

Price rarely got beat.  The reason was the way Price handled himself.  If you messed with him, Price wouldn’t call or threaten you over the Internet.  He didn’t spray your house with women and children in it.  He didn’t get his boys.  He didn’t mess up your car.  Price took care of his business with his fists and boots.  People who fucked with Price were beaten – severely, old school style.  Not bitch slapped, not fucked-up, not ass whupped -- beaten.  He would do it himself, alone, or maybe take a white guy along so that he wouldn’t kill the man.  Price would break noses, blacken eyes and knockout teeth with one punch.  He would take out a knee or break an arm if he was in a bad mood.  Price didn’t need a weapon.  His rock-hard body was a weapon.  His hands were like grizzly paws.  He was a ferocious fighter, he was mean and he liked to fight.  One time he beat a man that he ran into in Walmart, right then and there, in front of his wife and kids.  Price was known for hurting men and that meant that few tried him and those that did regretted it.

Could I remove the coating and dissolve the tablet in water and dose volumentrially? I've heard oral (and plugged!) BA is awful, but I could drip the solution into my nose slowly.

I'm afraid of fentanyl presses like everyone, but I have test strips for it, so between that and a seller with good rep (and a non-infinite supply), I should be able to figure out if it's pressed and just toss it.


I have narcan on hand and would have someone with me for the experience. Anything you think I'm missing? Even though I have a bit of a tolerance, it's nothing like shooting H or fent, so I figured I'd start with miniscule amounts (like an 1/8th of a 10mg).

I could get two 8mg buprenorphine sublingual pills, the brand is called buprenaddict. (Those are supposedly without Naloxone in them.)
So they are supposed to be consumed sublingually, I'm taking from the name, lol. But is that the most efficent ROA - seeing as I only have 2, I'll have to be very efficent with them.

I'm thinking I'll try to wait as long as I can after my last H dose, then take half a pill and see if I'll get into a state from full on withdrawal to something managable.
Then I'm waiting... and taking the next half a pill the next time it gets really bad? How soon after should that be?
I'm not actuall sure exactly how to dose this so that I don't just take the subs for 2 days and then get the whole full spectrum of H withdrawal only 2 days later, lol.
My goal is to get clean with the help of these making WDs a little more managable, maybe then I'll be able to make it this time.
Or should I try to put getting more of those bupre pills on the top of my to-do list bc I won't get anywhere with just 2 pills? My plan here is not to get on sub maintenance and stay on it here, tho, so I only wanna be taking them a few days for sure.

I made the appointment yesterday and over the phone was told that I sounded like a good fit for IOP. (I may have lied a little bit about how much I’m actually using because I refuse to go inpatient, leaving my new job and pet)
My old counselor there called me this morning and said “well if they keep you overnight I’ll see you in the morning” and I freaked out.  My friend who also went there told me that they get people to come in for “assessments” and then somehow get you to stay. 
Are they legally allowed to do this? If I drive myself up there...sober. Surely they can’t, right? Maybe my friend meant they talked these others into it voluntarily, but I’m prepared to say fuck no. Just wanted some insight before driving up there and not being able to leave. ",1523379658.0

My brother left Georgia in October 2016 as a walking skeleton. I had only seen him a few times in the decade prior, but this time he showed up looking thin and tired and somehow so grey and so yellow. He detoxed at our parent's house. 

He was also on parole, over H. However, he was clearly going to die if he stayed there. His Hail Mary throw was to board a plane and come back to MI. He showed up with a back pack. During the week, he realized he wasn't ready to go back to GA. He would use again. He called his parole officer to let him know he wasn't going back. His parole officer told him that would be breaking parole, but my brother never moved back.

Of course, my brother struggled during recovery. On my birthday, my Mom found a needle in the bathroom and my brother nodding off in his bedroom. There were slip ups. He made mistakes. I'm an alcoholic, so I know recovery isn't always smooth. Addiction is hard. But he was recovering!

My brother got a really cushy job! He gained weight! I found him a doctor that prescribed Suboxone, and now he is that same guy I remember from childhood. He still smokes like a chimney, but I believe him now when he says he isn't using. He has abused drugs for almost twenty years, but once I heard he was on opiates I was scared he would die. 

Anyway, my brother was back in my life. My family was complete. Then, when driving the car he was able to save up for (SO MUCH PERSONAL GROWTH!) he got pulled over for speeding in a school zone. The cop ran his plates and then took him to the county jail for GA to pick him up. GA wants my brother to go to court for violating his parole.

The county jail doesn't provide Suboxone, so my brother goes through withdrawal. He said it wasn't so bad, which was heartening.

I just felt so heartbroken because I finally got my brother back, and he was taking responsibility for himself, but this consequence of his actions still found him. I don't know how long he will be gone (he spent a week waiting for GA to pick him up), or what his punishment may be, but... I don't know. I'm mad he is being punished when he did what he needed to just to stay alive.

The good news, though, is that the lawyer thinks she can get my brother back to MI to finish his parole. I'm tired of waiting, though. I finally was able to enjoy my brother. We both have dogs we would take to the dog park together, and he would make jokes about the stuffy labradoodle owners. I miss him.

I don't know what the point of this post was, besides to purge my feelings. I'm sorry if this was the wrong place. I just love someone who got addicted to opiates after getting kidney stones.",1523373811.0

part1: https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8b3c3k/just_did_heroin_for_the_first_time_advice_xpost/

Okay, so first of all I'll have to admit that I did it twice. But I've been having an intense feeling that this shit will fuck me up and get me completely addicted. Although it's so relieving; No worries and no problems. Even better with weed!

Earlier today I smoked it for the second time in the forest, alone this time, and then I simply decided ""Fuck it, I won't do this shit again, let alone buy it again."" and promptly threw my remaining dope on the ground. I've experienced it twice now, no need to continue. I don't think that the risk is worth the reward.

It was a nice experience, but I'll do myself a favor and stay off it. I don't want a drug to take complete control of my life. Thanks to all of you though, I wouldn't have thrown it away if it weren't for you guys!

I missed more than a year of school. 365 days of school. 

During these times the doctors perscribed opiate pain killers. 

I remember I was a troubled child, and taking those pills only made it worse. (Broken home, lack of love, abuse, you get the picture) 

I didn't realize during that time how much those pain killers did a number on my mental stability. I never got addicted, but they really fucked with my chemistry at such a vital time in my childhood. 

My high school life revolved around drugs. I'd drink alch by myself, to doing x alone. Smoked weed laced with meth (There was a batch going around in my city.) 

I tried to OD on the opiate pills once. It wasn't much, but I rememeber not being able to move and just sitting on the stairs of my house drugged up, alone at home. (I was usually alone.)

Out of high school I started messing with ecstasy again. I dropped a bad batch and it really messed with my mind. I was in psychosis for a few years after that. Formed a mild schitzo, massive anxiety, and a boat load of other mental instability. Because of this, I lost the only person that mattered to me at the time. ex gf of 7 years. 

I decided to turn my life around at this point and did.

My chipping got out of hand like 2/3 months ago, in that I was pushing 3/4 (and still am) nights of using a week. Last couple weeks I've had nights where I'm sniffing up to 7/8 points (granted it's not very pure, but still). Use for a couple days, feel great, then off, withdraw. It's not full blown or severe, but I'm literally detoxing essentially once a week...

I used last Fri-Sun. Spent pretty much all of yesterday sleeping, literally slept 14 fucking hours last night. Woke up for work, went in a complete haze. Mad chills yet I'm sweating, aches and bathroom trips every 45 minutes. Dissociated AF, look and feel like I'm severely hungover *and* decided to have a line of ket before work. It's seriously stupid, and very draining (combined with literally not having a **single** day off most weeks, I'm either at uni or working full time), but every time I decide to cop it and let my body groan. I feel better on day 3/4, have plenty of cash, so I decide to go pick up a half gram. Maybe I do the same thing the next night or two. Again, and *again*, and **again**. The dance continues.

A big part of me is definitely trying to put the brakes on, I know how fine a line I'm walking, and the only thing I've ever been somewhat pleased with my opioid use has been my total and utter refusal to use day-in, day-out. But honestly at this point this is feeling arguably worse.

Telling myself again that this week I will let myself fully detox and get my shit together. At least take a month before pondering my desire to chip. This shit is ridiculous. The money spent is ridiculous. But man that feeling of pulling up after the first fat line of the day is just so good :(

I feel stupid, shameful and just generally like I'm an embarrassment to my family and all the splendid mental help professionals that have supported me in the past. This isn't sustainable. Feelsbadman.

I decided to walk a half of a mile to the gas station to buy smokes instead of drive because i was bored. Anyhow i get there, run into, (Let's call him Guido) Guido. So Guido looks fucked out of his mind, like always. This is the kind of dude that takes 30 minutes to weigh a 50 piece because of how many times he nods out and bangs his head off the scale. Ive showed up to his spot and had to use narcan on him so A. He wouldn't die and B. So I could buy my fuckin dope. Gave me a free 20 piece for it..  thats neither here nor there though

Anyway we start chatting and figure out we are both going to be walking the same way, after we got out of the gas station he tells me he's holding. Has (however much i want) of girl and boy on him. I decline and state again i'm on my way to intensive out patient rehab. He mumbles in his stuper about how thats cool for me, and he really would like to go to detox before he gets arrested because he doesn't want to W/D in jail. He mentions a few warrants he has, and i resoond plugging the rehab place i attend ( good program.) 

2 blocks into our walk an unmarked pulls up and gets out and screams "" Guido get on the ground now, hands behind your back!"" Guido complys then 3 more unmarked cars pull up, one of them starts harassing me asking if i was with Guido. I say i'm not and on my way back to rehab. They say i'm lying and get the drug dog out of the back and make it hit on me, i didn't have anything on me besides my prescribed subs... they let me go then turn the dog onto Guido, it hits and they find 2 bricks and a quarter of hard in his underwear. I walk back to rehab feeling more relieved than ever... This story is pointless but i thought it was kinda interesting, i feel bad i wish Guido would have gotten into a program, he was always good to me. Anyways have a good night opi fam.

How are you doing? My life has been pretty insane. After a 2 week hospitalization that included 3 low-dose ketamine treatments I was discharged off of 0.5mgs of dialudid IV every 4hrs and 15mgs of oxycodone every 4hrs to an ultra small script of 30 5mg Oxycodone pills. My previous pain doctor wouldn’t see me because he’s getting out of the pain management business (to no fault of my own) and I hit withdrawals last week Friday prompting an emergency visit with a very expensive pain specialist. He gave me a two week supply of medication and told me to come back in 2 weeks and spend more money.

So, I followed up with an additional specialist covered by my insurance today and I don’t know how to feel about it. He immediately suggested I install a pain pump/spinal cord stimulator thing to which I politely declined. I've been through enough traumatic surgical procedures and want to hold off on this option for as long as possible.

Then he tried to put me on belbuca selling it to me as “for pain” and “not buprenorphine” he also gave me false information about how you could seamlessly transition from taking oxycodone to taking that without being in withdrawals first. 

I had to drive home the point that I had a seizure on buprenorphine in the past and was unwilling to take that without being under supervision first. To which he finally just increased my Lyrica dosage and switched me from oxycodone 10mg 3x/day to Dilaudid 2mg 3x/day saying it didn’t have the same reputation as oxycodone and not to drink with it.

I think I’m going to have to stay with this doctor though. He’s crap but he at least prescribed me something useful and he doesn’t cost $250 a visit wanting to see me every two weeks. He’s covered. 

I don’t know. Shitpost. At least I got something even if it is a 50% overall equivalency decrease. They give me the Dialudid in the hospital and it works well. So yah.",1523325378.0

I found an oxy connect and it was an infinitely better buzz.  We had a massive crackdown in my country on pills and the costs escalated and pills dried up.

Then I found opium. Morphine got me high every time, even though I had to escalate doses.

Then I managed to cripple myself spinally through sport, and was eventually prescribed oxycodine. Being an addict, I quickly raised my prescribed dose to 60mg a day, and I started abusing that to all ends. I was taking between 100mg-180mg a day. I would go through a month's script in 10-12 days. I'd go through WD, and then when the script was available again I'd jump straight on it.

But I found I can't get 'high' on oxy after a couple of days. No matter how much I took, I'd at best just nod out, but without any euphoria. I was swallowing all these pills without any pay off.

It was probably for the best because I no longer crave it, but it seems like I'm the only one this happens to. Oxy bottoms out in regards to the high once you've been an addict for a while. I've never done H, but morphine can seem to keep giving me a buzz if I take insane doses of it while oxy doesn't.

I took 130mg for my last dose last week and I felt nothing. In fact, I felt more depressed than usual. Does anyone else feel the same about oxy?",1523325283.0

Anyway, I was wondering if there are any other poly drug addicts around? For those wondering what it's like I'll explain how it works for me:

Every day, I have what I'd call an itch. An itch to be high. This is a different kind of high though; It's simply a physiological change. What I mean is I crave for any feeling that'll deny me of being sober. Weirdly, I'm fine with being sober. I feel like I've been vague so far so I'll explain my drug usage now - I'm young and I live in the UK which has quite a large drug/rave scene for my age range which means every weekend I'll go out and get drunk with another drug added to the mix, usually ketamine since that's very popular in the UK. Every few months I'll do mandy and during festival season in summer I'll do a lot of pills. This is normal for most outgoing kids in the UK. 

For most people this stops on the weekdays but for me I find that I still need some sort of drug to get through. Coffee at this time is perfect. I'll have a bunch of mugs of coffee on the weekdays for about 2 weeks, and then I'll switch to caffeine pills for 2 weeks as my tolerance increases and then with a click of my fingers I'll stop consuming any form of caffeine (except for chocolate and a fizzy drink here and there). 

Next I'll crave weed and be the biggest stoner for the next 2 months, starting with joins then going on to blunts and then hitting bongs and then edibles etc.

Next I'll crave a different kind of drug. Maybe kratom. For the next month I'll take kratom daily like with the coffee and then one day I'd just stop. Next might be alcohol and those benders I'd normally just have on the weekends with mates turns into some vodka every night and again, with a click of a finger,I'd stop. The worst part is that every year I get depressed for about 2/3 weeks. This is when I fuck with hard opiates, namely heroin. Other than codeine the other opiates are very hard to come by in the UK even with DNM's so I'll smoke a lot of H like I have been recently and again, just like I did yesterday, I'll just stop. 

I've also done LSD a few times (bad trips every single time, will probably try again in a few years) and shrooms as well. The interesting part, however, is that every year there are times when I'm sober and I don't crave any drug. This is always the time when I have exams coming up or a deadline for work. I'll be so immersed in my work that drugs don't even cross my mind and when I complete that work to a high standard it's sort of a high itself. As a result, I've always done well in school and uni and when I complete uni I've already been offered a mid-level high-paying job. Leading up to this intense work time, I tend to turn into a bit of a 'junkie', chasing each high, getting more drunk than my friends, doing every high I could possibly get my hands on and just being completely reckless with my otherwise safe drug use. I feel like I'm constantly chasing highs which has worked for me so far but I'm worried about the future so I have a few questions for you guys (and I'd be happy to answer any you have for me):

1. Are any of you functioning poly drug addicts?
2. How do you deal with it? How do you scratch that itch?
3. How old are you (Doesn't need to be specific)?
4. Do you think I could keep this up? As of right now I plan on cutting off all of my hard drug usage when I start my first career-oriented job out of uni
5. Are any of you non-functioning poly-drug addicts and if so, where do you think it went wrong?
6. Are any of you addicted to one drug and do you have any advice / questions for me?

Today I met an old friend who's a heroin user, and since she knew the streets, I agreed to buying heroin together.

Now, I know that I probably sound like an ""idiot junkie"", but can't help it due to a ton of problems with me and my life. I'd rather be addicted to drugs and happy than abstaining from drugs and live in misery. My wish and goal though, is to do drugs in moderation. I don't really want to do drugs every day.

I met her, and we went to the drug dealing area with police at nearly every corner. We met a dealer that seemed pretty laidback, and she had bought from him before. We went to smoke it and I felt really good, relaxed and like my problems had just vanished away.

I just got home and still have the majority of it left(about 2-5 doses?), but I'm worried that this will lead to an addiction worse than weed, speed and alcohol combined. I'm really in need of some advice here and I'm not really sure what to do. How do I not get addicted? What should I do?

I've come across 2 12mcg sandoz fentanyl patches, I put the first one on my skin saturday around 7PM, the next morning I popped 9mg bromazepam and proceeded to have a jolly good day. Today I popped another 9mg brom and cut the second patch in half, put in inside my cheek for a while then chewed it, then nodded quite nicely pretty much all afternon, I mean I played a good deal of video games and watch a bunch of shows with my TV and PS4 not on... my tolerance for BZD and opis is pretty low these days.

Anyway, all this was fine and enjoyable but I'd still like to try to plug the last half and see how it goes, alas apparently the matrix patches aren't really the best for that...

The idea was to IV it though, and it might be a little overkill for plugging...

So I wanted to pick up a g of ecp with a friend, it was my friends plug. I pick up the friend and we head to the dude about 30 minutes away, my friend isn’t talking much and just says hes tired, I think this is a bit weird but whatever. He asked me for the money before we pulled up which he never does, I park on the side of Taco Bell and he runs around to the other side to the dude. About 10 minutes pass and I’m starting to get nervous then all the sudden my friend pops into view and jumps in. He gave me my shit in foil and said be careful he couldn’t close the bag so that’s why it’s in foil. I’m like cool, seems like a lot and we take off. I drop off my friend and I go home, when I get home I dump the bag which is all powder into a mirror. 

(Some mini back story: I’ve given the dude 100 before and got a tiny bag with 3 rocks that got me and my girl very good for around 2 hours(prob fent). This dude doesn’t do it by point so I throw a number out like I want 100$ worth and that’s what I got. So I never know how much I’m getting, this is all thru my friend)

There’s a lot of powder and it’s more white then the last few times although it’s usually barely tan anyway. Well I’m chopping it up and my girl and I each do a line, starting to feel it, we do another, feeling good. Then I notice the powder is clumping it together and getting gummy. We try to smoke some and don’t feel anything, try to snort tiny hard rocks, doesn’t work. Tried to boof a decent amount and felt a little something for about 30 seconds then nothing. 

Ended up doing it all with only about 30 minutes of being high in total. Clearly it has some fent but what’s going on lol. Like it felt like someone took a .3 of dope/fent and mixed it with starch just to add up to a G. Makes me think my friend has something to do with it, like him texting the dude oh he’s about to spend 120 and he wants a g, give him a real weak bag and hook me up with the difference of good shit. The the 4 or 5 times before this it’s always been good but always looked tiny, my friend told me the dude does a g for 120, for 2 weeks I’ve tried to get a g and told he doesn’t have it or whatever.  Then this time it’s fine he can do it and I get a fat bag but it’s weak af. 

I give this friend rides to pick up drugs and I throw him money or drugs for helping me out when I need some and he helps. I think maybe my friend got sick of my asking for a g and told the plug to just give me a weak bag that’s big. 


Tldr; went to buy a g for 120, got the g and went home, got home to realize the bag was mostly just filler/starch, think my friend is cashing in on my misfortune ",1523298262.0

You may have seen me comment on here. Would love some input. I am 40 yo, was on opiates for most of my adult life. In 2015 got on subs, stayed on them for 2 years, then went to rehab to get off them (I tapered in that 2 years from 12mg/day down to 2mg/day) I just didn't want something ""controlling"" me anymore, so I got off the subs. Been clean about a year and a half now....
I'm seriously considering getting back on a low dose of them. Since being clean, I've been a wreck. Major bouts of depression, anxiety, and dealing with diagnosed bipolar disorder. I definitely didn't feel any of these negative chemical imbalances when I was on opiates (as long as I didn't run out and get sick) and definitely didn't when I was on the subs and had a script so I had them everyday. 

My friends think I'm nuts. Like the usual ""you worked so hard to get off that shit, why would you get back on it?"" Type of stuff, but seriously.... I have never felt worse in my life. I just can't seem to get my shit together mentally and physically. I don't sleep or eat right.... *AND its been a year and a half*

I recently made an appointment to see a psychologist in my area who is also a suboxone doctor. I dunno.... do you think it's foolish???.

I present this.

https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/mood-disorders/buprenorphine-improved-resistant-depression-outcomes/article/368764/

I'm actually going to see if he'll prescribe it for depression treatment, rather than addiction treatment (since I've been clean for a year and a half)

I don't know.... a few months ago I got a half of an 8mg strip from a friend (4mg) I broke it down to .5mg doses, and for a week, I felt great. Mind you, with such a low dose I didn't get *high*..... but I felt way better than I had for some time. 

Studies are being conducted and they are finding buprenepherine is great at treating depression *in low doses*

Left to his own devices, his own unmade decisions, particularly in moments of solitude, he felt the slight tug blossom into a uni-directional yank.

Not in any pre-determined physical direction, but in a jagged spiritual pathway towards that which would bring him the sting of danger and the warm gauze of release.

It wasn’t a release in the sexual sense, or even in the spiritual sense.

It was the sweet release of determination.

It was hand slamming on the reset button, beginning the timer afresh, a new bright clear morning.


He’d tell himself: 

It’s the dawn of a magnificent new struggle, begun with the shapeless warmth and gentle eyes of that fiendish old current welcomed back into his system.


The struggle was surely just one of simple mathematics:

One day on, One day off.

Or maybe Two days on, Two days off.

Or perhaps Three days on, Two days off.

Or why not eradicate the bun entirely –surely it could be wiped out in a day or two– and hunker down for the invisible journey that awaits on the other side?

Tear through The Ten with a spiteful urgency, a malevolent glee; Tearing, Chopping, Sliding, Breathing; Stabbing the Angel with a sharp inward current of wind; Stabbing and Stabbing again.

Until there’s nothing left to Tear open.

And It slowly awakes, bleary-eyed and hungry from Its bitter cold slumber.


Decisions have to be made:

To take action or to hunker down and hope that it passes over quickly and quietly.

No doubt you’ll feel the Angel’s cold breath in your bones as it passes; It knows you’re in there, hiding, quaking under your damp bedsheets.

How slowly will it pass? How close will It come? How much of It’s icy breath will surround your skin and permeate your being down to your sick marrow and helpless lungs?


The ever-present question:

How close will you allow it to come?

How close until you rise from your sweaty bed and take that first step on your quest to find the sacred blade that will gash the Angel back into its sacred slumber?

How proud that first step!

How exhilarating that wind-swept first swing of the blade!

How calm and clean, silent and warm those first moments when the Angel drifts off and you sense It’s softly dithering snore.

How delicately ritualistic those first few motions that follow your initial frenzied swing:

The tear

The chop

The slide

The breathe

The stab

The Five Points of the Glowing Star that resides deep in your chest.

Beyond the heart.

Beyond the breath.

Deeper than your bones.

Deeper than your blood.

Smaller than the cells that orbit throughout your system.

Less quantifiable than consciousness.

Less alive than death.",1523293039.0

A few weeks ago I came out of a 28 day treatment center and has tapered down to 4mg suboxone over the course of my stay (it was an intense taper) with the aim of dropping by 2mg a week. So after 2 weeks I'd be off... 

Anyway. I ended up leaving with a girl I met in rehab and moving to her city; I didn't wanna go home first so I bought only the things I had with me in rehab (so I don't have a phone or my wallet). I had convinced myself, well we had convinced ourselves, that we had fallen in love. 

Anyway. This girl has a connection that can supply her with infinite amounts of methadone, so to get some cash she encouraged me to sell my last few subs(the things that were gonna get me off) for some petrol money.. and that I could use her methadone, also her Valium, of which I am fully dependent on her for both these things. 

We didn't stay sober for long, for the past 3 weeks we've been doing dope and crack quite often, although not everyday however I've been taking 100mg+ of methadone and 20-50mg diazepam... 

Last night we got into this vicious argument about the last chip of crack, it ended badly and with her saying shes no longer gonna give me meds... but I made nice with her today, told her I loved her etc... and she's given me 500mg of methadone, it's not the last she's giving me she just said I must try make it last 3 days before she'll give more(she has an insane amount, I can see 3000mg but apparently there's a lot more stashed) but that's not what I want, I wanna get off being dependent on this woman and odd opiates LIKE I INTENDED to when I went in to rehab. I was so fucking close to getting off for good before I moved close to her... 

I said this in the last post but be careful of rehab relationships, when you're in there you're lonely and vulnerable, on the outside things change..

So, what's the quickest way(if possible) I can get off with methadone using 500mg.... remember I'm a heroin addict, only been on 'done for 3 weeks...

A little something crossed my mind this afternoon & I just wanted to get some feedback from our wonderful community.

As an opiate addict at some point you could quite possibly eventually have a run in with the law. Even at no fault of your own. It happens everyday, and subsequently as is notorious in the United States you will likely end up being required by the courts to take the old [piss test](https://imgur.com/a/ky10U). 

Myself included, I know most opiate addicts are really good people, but we are just totally slaves to our addiction for no reason other than we've fucked our brain chemistry up & we don't want to be sick. Fight or flight. It's not a character flaw - we're not fucking losers we literally have a fucking DISEASE. 

So where i'm going with this. If one of us, in the medical world, is legitimately diagnosed by a doctor as having the DISEASE OF **OPIATE DEPENDENCY** - shouldn't failing a drug test for opiates fall under the same category as being an issue that manifest itself from the disease?

I understand opiates are unfortunately illegal the way some of us take them. Even if we hate it, and want to be opiate free we are chained by the illness.  My question is, if someone was in recovery, and genuinely trying to fight their disease - wouldn't failing a drug test for opiates just be a symptom that results from the disease?

I know the courts are about 100 years away from even considering seeing it this way, but honestly could this logic be used as a defense if you were to find yourself fighting a positive drug test? I'm not sure I've explained myself well enough, but you guys are smart & can hopefully understand where I'm going with this. What are your thoughts?

Edit: And honestly on this same tip - How can jails deny you legally prescribed Suboxone if you or a family member brings it in correct container? I mean these are supreme court level type questions.

My doctor recommended me for suboxone a couple of days ago for Kratom withdrawals. You read that right. We don’t need to go into how absurd that is here, because it’s usually the other way around.

However, I’d like to know about what exactly it is. For someone who is not severely addicted to opioids like myself (the withdrawals exist and they aren’t fun, but id say it is not physically sickening like I know heroin or most of opioids have) would suboxone have the potential to make one feel “high?” I know buprenorphine is a very potent chemical, and with my comparably low opioid tolerance, what would, say, 2mg feel like?

I took 5 grams of kratom this morning around 1030am and unexpectedly came across a few 15s. Obviously because I have no self control I immediately ate 2 and snorted 1. My typical dose of Oxy to feel a decent buzz is about 60mg (2 30s - 4 15s). (90 mg gets me feeling fantastic though that's neither here or there) I felt a slight buzz from the 45 mg but not what I was hoping for but I also don't wanna waste my last 60mg. I'm thinking of taking the 60mg around 230-3pm before work. (I'm a bartender so these guys really help in my being super upbeat & talkative ) ANYWAYS , does anyone think that 4-5 hours after a 5g kratom dose will be a long enough window to feel the percocets ? Like I said I took the 45mg about an hour & a half after the 5g of kratom and felt a slight buzz but I'm not sure if that was just a placebo effect. ",1523207863.0

I was a lineman and the company made everyone pass Red Cross First Aid, so I was trained to call 911 first and then start CPR.

Rick starting breathing with that rattle breathe, but only three breaths / minute.  Finally Fire and Rescue comes and they asked me what he took, which was two 80s, a bar, a dub and half a bottle. They hit Rick with NARCAN and took him to hospital.  Rick died the next day.  The cops called me and asked questions, but I was at work and had an alibi.

About 20 mins ago I made a small switch in the order of the steps I take to prep my shots and I think it left me with a slightly more potent shot (I'm kinda nodding typing this so it definitely did the trick), which inspired me to ask about switches others have made.

In the past my method has been putting the dope in the spoon, squirting some water in, applying some heat, mixing, filtering (cotton) and shooting (More minutiae than that but not especially pertinent atm)

Tonight my first step was putting water in the spoon, heating it, *then* throwing the dope in, followed by mixing etc.

I'm not the best at slowly heating and in the past I know I've reduced potency by overcooking. Heating the water a lot, letting it cool juuust a little then adding the product meant that if I happened to draw up fewer mls before shooting that difference could be attributed to **just** water evaporating, not product along with it.

Not applying heat with the smack in the spoon also forced me to be a little more patient while the H was dissolving - I mixed it a bit then set the spoon down, got ready for night nodding (brushed teeth, prepped netflix), came back, stirred a little more then filtered and shot. I've always heard folks say cold shots are superior but I've never been patient enough for that - I feel like this is a happy medium :)

I'm always open to suggestions for enjoying my tar the best I can, so what do you guys do in your prep process to improve your shots?

It's feel a great rush and feel good for a little bit or wake up in cold sweats from getting hit with narcan. 
My friend, who has about the same tolerance, will do the same amount and he is nodding hardcover.

Sure, after 30 days at 800mg of codeine (Schedule 2) you'll be more physically dependent than at 200mg a day (schedule 4). But this completely fails to take in consideration that noone gets prescribed 800mg day to start, and you're not more likely to get psychologically addicted at all. The effect of drug schedules is that users are punished different amounts for same crime, and not to mention that the actual classification of drugs into the schedules is horrific!  

Lets take a look:

Schedule 1: (No medical use)
Dope,
PCP,
LSD (all hallucinogens),
Cannabis,
Synthetic Cannabis,
Meth (Even though it clearly has a medical use listed as a schedule 3)
GHB,
Morphine,
Shrooms,
MDMA

Schedule 2: (Medical use but high potential for abuse)
Addy,
Carfent,
Fent,
Methadone,
Hydrocodone,
500mg of Codeine,
Dilaudid,
Oxy

Schedule 3:
Ketamine,
Morphine under 50mg
Meth

Schedule 4:
Xanax,
Valium (most benzos)

Schedule 5:
Codeine under 200mgs

Drug schedules don't keep doctors making safe prescriptions?!? They don't protect the public from being prescribed dangerous drugs, they value punishing users for having larger addictions and flat out deny medical uses and contradictions in their schedules. Potential for abuse is NOT = measurable impact of physical dependence after prescription is consumed.

Ever since I've used almost all of that kratom, usually in high doses and redosing several times when I use (not opiate naive, assume using starting on kratom the day after first time with h skyrocketed my tolerance). 

Went back to my apartment for a day recently, binge smoked some more h over the course of an evening and woke up with a hangover from hell, was throwing up, had a headache and couldn't keep food down without it coming back up for a solid few hours. Left the h and rest of the kratom at my apartment so I don't get tempted. Got some bars and went back to stay with family over the holidays. First night I had 2 bars (fucking delusions of sobriety) and slept for hours, second night just one bar and ended up sleeping for almost 14 hours(?!?!), got out of bed at 6pm (yikes), waking up sweating like a pig a few times during the night, and have had fucked up body temperature since. Tonight I think the plan is to have half a bar and a couple beers so I can wake up early and meet some mates at the pub.

My question is, have I managed to develop a physical dependence to kratom already from using it in such high doses (10-25g) almost daily? Won't have access to any opiates for another month so if so I'll have to just deal with it, got 5 bars and plenty of street speed on hand to regulate sleep cycle tho.

I fuckin love to get high on pain killers.

I’ve only tried mostly mild prescription pills, Codeine, DHC, Tramadol and some morphine and oxy use. 

I am prescribed 100 X 30/500mg codeine/Paracetemol every 20 days for Lower back pain. This has been going on for about a year. However this 20 day supply barely lasts 48 hours. By the second day I have CWE’d the pills and consumed all 3000mg  usually in 5 doses. 

I’ve heard the stories of codeine having a ceiling dose at 400mg but I do notice a difference between 400 and 600. 
Anyway. My problem comes from the residual paracetamol left after the CWE. No matter how many times i filter or what material I use to filter I still get a residual amount which would be totally safe if I didn’t take 1500mg of codeine each day. 

I have overdosed on paracetamol a few times, once resulting in hospitalisation. I explained I take a lot of cocodomol and paracetamol for my back pain and they werent suspicious even giving me IV morphine at low doses for my pain while In hospital. 

I was wondering if I asked my doctor to put me on something stronger what his first response would be. Tramadol isn’t an option because I puke hard. 

Bearing in mind this is the NHS I’m dealing with and they are strict with opiates. 

Obviously I won’t tell the doc I’m taking half the box and CWEing them. 

I’m using OTC codeine syrup and DNM oxy pills on top of the script Most days.

It started about 6 months ago when I went off my antipsychotic meds in order to elimate negative side effects . (I have bipolar and borderline personality disorder) In the process of getting off the meds I lost my mind and tried herion. Biggest mistake of my life.

Long story short now I'm at a point where I'm smoking over a gram per day just to keep from getting sick, I don't get high off it anymore. I would have started shooting it a long time ago but knowing me once I do a shot I'll never come back from that . I go into severe withdrawal every 4 hrs if I don't smoke and it gets really bad really quick. Freezing cold, sweating, vomiting, muscle cramps, the whole bit . The worst part is it makes me start having a panic attack so I'm unable to breathe/hyperventilating while crying and shaking.

I've tried methadone and it really doesn't help me as much as it seems to for others, and I don't want to become addicted to that next .

I'm planning on taking suboxone and xanax which has helped in the past but I know it's still going to be torture.

The part I'm most worried about is my mental health. I feel myself starting to go into an episode and completely lose it. I feel like I will become so suicidal and generally screwed up in the head urging the process of withdrawal that it's going to trigger me to go into a state of mind I won't be able to come back from for a while. I haven't had thoughts of self harm since I was 15, and I found myself waking up and burning my leg with a lighter last night I couldn't stop myself whatsoever. I felt so dissociative and far from reality that it scared me. 

Does anyone with mental illness have experience getting off opioids? Are these feelings only going to last through the whithdrawls or am I going to lose my mind for a while?

I'm so scared of the mental aspect of my withdrawals that it's making me want to give up and kill myself . Any help or advice would be appreciated I really don't know what to do or what's going to happen",1523088525.0

Goodbye Heroin,

It hurts my heart, we have to part, 
But this is for the best. 
You filled a hole, inside my soul, 
And I’m sure you know the rest.  
My life you took, my world you shook, 
Now I’ll never be the same. 
And you were worth, my time at first, 
But you played me like a game. 

The shit I did, is no way to live, 
So I’ll have to say goodbye.  
I hurt my friends, and in the end, 
You made me want to die. 
You lied to me, you said you’ll be, 
The best friend I ever had. 
When you were gone, your warmth I longed, 
I realized you were bad. 

I finally knew, when I craved you, 
That you would cause me pain.  
I stole so much, to get your rush, 
I needed you in my veins.  
You took my life, and made it nice, 
Then you had to mess it up. 
I crashed my cars, and tried so hard, 
But never could I stop. 

I made my choice, but lost my voice, 
I couldn’t ask for help, 
You caused me harm, scars on my arms, 
You watched me as I fell.  
If only you knew, that I am through, 
Maybe you’d leave me alone.  
There’s things I’ve lost, due to your cost, 
My morals, my friends, my home. 

By putting you first, there’s people I’ve hurt, 
Now I realize you are shit.  
So this is the end, my dear old friend, 
It’s over, I’m done, I quit.",1523092992.0

[shytpost extraordinaire - no proofreading just hitted send],"I'll keep this short. I was asked for money today in exchange for roxies from Cliff's script, to be available today within an hour of providing cash. It was due to an insurance change. Basically the insurer was willing to cover a 7 day supply for 2 per day but was not willing to cover the month until next month when the authorizations came through and shit.

&nbsp;

In the mean time the script would cost $210 for the full month. Cliff already owed me four because I loaned him cab money knowing full well that I'd get the 4 when today came. Due to this unforeseen scenario I would either say ""fuck it, you wait and I'll wait"" or pitch in further. So ultimately I lowballed, I said ""I have $120"" so that I wouldn't clean myself out and have money to use for the week ahead. Cliff did ultimately make up the difference with the aide of a friend form out of state who visits our City every week. After a transfer and a visit to the bank via cab, Cliff went right to the pharmacy. Even gave me three extra in addition to the amount he gave me for the money I provided. Normally I'm given two extra for free due the effort I make in picking it up for him and because that's what a cab would cost.


&nbsp;


So now, no pressure, I can do whatever I want at this stage. I had a good day, my turtle polished off the bottle and I had a great day at work. 


Cliff made a fairly generous conditional offer.... Should I take it? I'm already leaning towards not but in the time it takes me to eat this pizza, maybe one of you will chime in and change my mind.

&nbsp;


Cliff said that he will give me two more free roxy 15's if I show up at his house before work tomorrow afternoon and show him that I have two roxies left in my bottle. **What would you do? What would you recommend I do?** Some might ask, ""what should I do?"" Should is such a subjective word, and many of us don't do what we *should*.""


I have two left right now and am leaning towards consuming them after I eat right now If I do that, then tomorrow I'm taking a sub if and when I feel physically, emotionally and/or psychologically compelled to do so. **Let's be honest, I'm ripping these pills in the form of lines after this pizza... still I'm open to suggestions if anyone beats my timing.**

&nbsp;


**TL;DR:** Started today with 15 roxies (15mg) and if I don't finish the last two and show those two to Cliff tomorrow afternoon before work, he'll give me two more for free.


&nbsp;

**P.S.-** In conclusion, I consumed I didn't save any so today I get to take subs if I start to feel funky but at the moment I feel sufficiently well since my last dose was about eight hour ago. This means that it might not be too soon but it probably is too soon to take a sub and it's never worth finding out that it is too soon. 


Was it worth it? Well, I was already due 5, 6 if I picked up the script so it was nice getting 15 but I didn't do a great job conserving. Even when I had the power to conserve, I tried running a derby to finish and here I am. 

To answer anyone's question, I think that maybe Cliff would've given me two free pills if I saved and then said ""hang out with me tonight since I was so generous"" or something like that. Maybe it's a bribe to increase the likelihood that I hang out with him because he did offer me a couple of bumps for after work. Either a couple of pills or bumps, not sure which but it's inconsequential if I have other plans tonight. ",1523086051.0

 I have been taking adderall and Xanax for the past few months pretty regularly.  It's been pretty consistent. I don't know what to do.  Should i call them and tell them the truth? Should i take the test and they can see the results?  Should i try to see a psychatrist to see if i can get them to prescribe those meds (i have an appt Wednesday an hour away and have to pay 250 up front)?

He went in Monday to get the results and apparently got some really bad news, and then killed himself Tuesday.   Some of my coworkers are speculating that results either showed liver cancer or hepatitis B.  Won’t get the autopsy results for a couple weeks.  I would think he committed suicide so he didn’t have to feeling the pain that was gonna come.  Also, does anyone know if you can take opiates when you have a fucked up liver?

Nothing has really changed; the dope is pretty much the same as it was a week ago. Also I have not been snorting long term- I moved from the west coast to the east coast 3 months ago. Out west I was smoking tar, and when I moved I took 2 months off from opiates. I have only been snorting for a month so I don't feel like i have done any major damage. My nose physically feels fine and there are no scabs and no bleeding that I have detected.

Anyone have any idea what could cause this? Although my nose doesn't feel clogged, I am thinking there is a chance that whatver non water soluble cut has accumulated and coated the blood vesels to some extent? I blow my nose semi regularly (not to the point where my nostrils are completely empty so that the powder flies right through into my throat, but still a fair bit), but maybe a full on flush with saline would be in order?

If I can't sort this out its either sober up or start IVing. I don't feel ready to end this run, but I know that returning to IVing would be a horrible decision. I IVd hydromorphone for half a year 4 years ago when I had an amazing plug, and while the high was great, the  lifestyle was destructive. Not that snorting/smoking aren't horrible ways of life, but IVing feels like a differnet ballpark. The temptation is there though- like I said I don't feel ready to end this run and any addict knows how difficult it is to sober up when you don't actually want it.

Has anyone encountered this type of issue with failure to nasally absorb drugs? Or do you think its just a pretty abrupt tolerance spike? I have upped my dose but so far its been futile so I am thinking its the former. ",1523071740.0

I have five 8mg subutex. I tried a few searches on google and on r/opiates and couldn't find a taper chart for subutex. 

I've done subutex before (one 8mg pill would last 3+ days) and figured I wouldn't need to do a full 8mg/dose to stop withdraws.

My tolerance to dope depends on my setting of where I'm using. At home where I am most of the time, I can do up to a gram per day. When I am using outside of home (dad's house, movie theatre, restaurant, etc.), I can do .2 and nod out without realizing. So I'm not positive as to where my tolerance is at.

If anyone can give tips or experiences with tapering short-term, I would appreciate it. I am looking for the least withdraw symptoms possible, so it doesn't have to be a 7-day taper, but not looking to do month long tapering as I only have 40mg of subutex.",1523070814.0

I had coffee on from earlier and chugged 24oz with my wife because I didn't wanna nod out on these. I just thought I was being a bitch or my tolerance was low be ause of the break but nah We were right.

I get the remaining 4 face the M's in one direction, turn them over and the score's and the number 30 are all in different spots, nothing was identical.

Fuck man I could have had a really fucking big problem.

8acqfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8acqfo/ugh_another_dboy_got_raided/,7,https://redd.it/8acqfo,rickersjun,"Ugh, another dboy got raided...","So I posted something about a month ago about my dope boy giving me the run-around about delivering to me.  I waited all day and night and he wasn't able to make it out that night.  He did swing by in the morning and delivered to me though, which was great. I found our a day or two later though that the reason he was unable to get out here was because his spot got raided that afternoon, and most of his people got popped too.  Pretty sure it was mainly because the crackheads and prostitutes he had selling for him were unreliable, flaky, morons who were far from discreet or careful about their behavior.  Always yelling and screaming at people they had problems with directly OUTSIDE the trap, calling tons of unnecessary attention to their operation.  Why my old dboy chose to continue having those dipshits handle business for him, I don't know, but yeah...his lack of caution got him busted, which sucks.

So a few days after he got popped, I walked around that side of town and was able to cold cop.  Found a chick who was willing to take me to the spot she hustles and tricks out of, and I quickly became a regular there.  Was out there yesterday and only had $10 to drop, but got what I needed quickly and left.  I don't like hanging around for long when I cop there because of the lack of caution that that hooker practices is just plain awful.  Always freaking out and being loud, yelling, fighting with addicts and johns, and just plain engaging in super hot behavior.  

So today I was psyched because had some decent money to spend and I got a ride out to the spot.  Had my Uber driver drop me off a block away and walked to the trap, only to find that someone was pulled over like two houses down from the spot and had multiple cruisers at the scene.  Pretty sure it was the plug. Asi walked by, I saw the hoe walking up to the trap house (within sight and earshot of the cops) and yelling up to the doorman super loud about so-and-so getting busted.  I walked on by and grabbed a cup of coffee from a local coffee shop, then casually walked past the trap house to see that the car that had been pulled over was gone, but the cops were now all parked at the spot and were apparently raiding the place.  So frustrating!

So again, because of lack of caution and care, I lost another connect.  What I don't understand is why dope boys continue to put their freedom in the hands of unreliable crackheads and prostitutes.  In my experience, most dope dealers I have gotten to know over the years are far from stupid, and are typically very careful.  So why the hell do they continue hiring flakes like these asshats?  If it were me, I'd only hire people with even tempers and calm demeanors.  Then again, I'm sure those kinds of personalities are few and far between.  

Anyway, this was just a post to vent about the ineptitude of dealers and their associates in my area.  I was able to cold cop a FIRE ass 20 bag of boy from someone else in the neighborhood (all she had was a 20 unfortunately,) but was wanting to get at least a half.  But hey, at least I was able to score SOMETHING and didn't end up getting popped for possession.  

Now it's time to do a nice shot of this fuego.  :)  Stay safe, everyone!",1523045848.0
8acndc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8acndc/wits_end_with_chronic_pain/,18,https://redd.it/8acndc,Cr0ssRo4ds,Wits End with Chronic Pain,"Sort of reaching out to any other members on here who also have chronic pain.  I am to the point where I have struggled with suicidal thoughts from pain for about 4 years straight almost daily.  This is the only problem in my life.  (Suicidal ideation is probably a better term.  I've never been close to actually ""doing it"" nor am I at the moment.)

I'm also very young.  The only time I can really get scripts is from post op procedures.  I white knuckled through the pain for so unbelievably long, not even taking pills after major surgeries... not once.

In early 2016 I started using kratom.  Still never touching one pill from scripts I started accumulating in 2009 when I was a young teenager from surgeries/broken bones.  My only opiate experience prior was IV in the hospitals... but imo there is something different about consciously choosing to take a substance verse in the hospital, even if it is more intense.  With the kratom I thought, *""Wow... this REALLY takes the edge off my pain""*  My depression subsided a lot.  I would only take kratom before work where my pain was the worst.

Late 2016 early 2017 my pain gets worse... I successfully complete another hip surgery (#2, first one on other side), get another script, still don't take it.  Stick to kratom and weed.

My main issue and what always has been is low back pain.  I thought it was because I was fat... so I dropped 100+ lbs.  Then maybe it's my posture?  Spent months correcting it.  Poor flexibility/core strength?  Worked my fucking ass off and am considered ""flexible"" when doctors examine me now.  Physical therapy?  Over 100 sessions.  Acupuncture /chiropractor?  Tried it.  Yoga?  Tried it.  Prescription NSAIDs?  Tried it, cortisone injections?  Ya ya you get it by now.

My first hip surgery was a failure, and they are refusing to do another one.  They literally told me to just wait **""A COUPLE YEARS** for stem cell treatment.  I'm sorry but that is horse shit.  1 minute in 10/10 pain feels like a couple years.  I strongly believe I have referred pain to my low back from my hip and if I could just get my damn hip fixed my back pain would go away.  Lidocaine diagnostic proves that at the very least my hip pain is sourced from my hip.

Anyway March 2017 rolls around, out of my mind and wanting a couple hours of no pain I finally pop 20mg worth of oxy.... *""ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh... I'm finally free.""*  I musta had 300 of these 5mg percs and went through them in about 2 months.  Eventually needing to up the dose and begin wasting them with CWEs.  

I go from May - November again relying on kratom... but fuck am I miserable and in PAIN.  November I see my surgeon again telling him how much pain I'm in, and he hesitantly gives me 5 5mg percs.  Not without a 45 minute discussion about me taking place outside the room and just this look of ""You freaking junkie.""  (They actually asked me if I was WDing from that script when I saw them again 3 months later lmfao).  I'm sorry but that's an insanely small script.

So December nothing but kratom, January this year I begin occasionally getting loose ms-contins when a family member had extra, by February that dried out, so nothing in February.

Here's where I began imo possibly overdoing it.

March I get a Panda connect with 0 opiate tolerance.  This is where I began snorting.  I could get a solid 4 uses out of a pill at first, but they're so potent my tolerance shot up faster I guess, I needed half.  Well that dried up (thank you FDA) so back to percs.. only this time I need something like 3x the dose of when I had no tolerance....

Basically I see where this road is heading... but I'm in SO MUCH PAIN!  This pain rn is so much worse than any surgical procedure I've had, any bone I've broken, I'm losing my mind right now.  I think I've spent $1k in the past month and part of me is seriously considering just going down this path to hell until I hit rock bottom and check out.  Because seriously what is the point of life when you're holding back tears 24/7, can't work, can't go out with friends, can't enjoy life.  These are supposed to help ""manage"" pain, but I can't help but take enough that it ""kills"" my pain.

I don't really know the complete purpose of this post, maybe I just needed to vent.  Basically almost everybody I know is really ignorant on the topic of drugs and if I confide in them about the pain I'm in and how I'm currently managing it I will get shunned as there are too many mutual friends who are dead as a result of opiates.

Fuck... I'm assuming post people in this subreddit are going through some type of pain, physical, emotional, or both.  I'm so sorry, I wish I could take it all away.  

Oh and it's not withdrawal pain or anything... but I think at my current dose I'm probably 1-3 weeks away from serious dependency beginning if I continue using.",1523045180.0

Tomorrow will be a week off of methadone. When I quit I was on 90mg liquid, once daily.

The first couple days weren't too bad, but it's gradually getting worse. These withdrawals are nothing compared to heroin withdrawals that I've gone through before, but the restless legs, muscle spasms, and over all depression and a sense of impending doom has been crippling. When can I expect to feel normal?

I've been taking excedrin for muscle aches, and I'm not gonna lie, I've been taking alot of Nyquil just so I can get to sleep. It takes hours to get to sleep but once I do I sleep for a solid 8-10 hours. I wake up extremely depressed and I have been getting chills and cold sweats. I thought I'd try to muscle through it and take long walks outside (I walked for over 3 hours today) but by the time I get back home I'm very sweaty and I feel like I have a fever.

I've been living in a sober living house for the past seven months, after a month in treatment. When I first moved in, people on subs or methadone weren't allowed in at all. About two months into living at the house, cravings and all that got bad, and everything I was doing with my sponsor and the steps left me feeling like I still might slip back into H. So I started buying subs from a dude I used to sell to back in the day, and taking a quarter or so of a sub a day.

It helped, like, a lot. I got involved in the recovery and sober living community in my area, worked with my sponsor productively, gained respect at my job and with my family. Things were going well. Hell, looking at the big picture, things still are going well.

See, my sober house is chartered under a nationwide organization of sober houses, where each house is mostly autonomous as long as some very basic conditions were met. My house meet those conditions my whole time there, but a few days ago, some people from the state and local parts of the org used false pretenses to sit in on our weekly house business meeting, where we discuss bills, rent, chores, etc. 

They came with the intent to intimidate and railroad us, and that's exactly what they did. They drug tested the whole house, which in retrospect was not even their prerogative to do. Obviously I popped for subs, and another guy for alcohol.

So I've been sleeping in living rooms and cheap motels for a few nights, and it's sucked, but I've been making it to work and all that, and now I can look for a place to rent with a friend. I've already got an appointment with a sub doctor on Wednesday so I can go legit. My sponsor has been really understanding and supportive. I haven't gotten high, and I don't see subs as a relapse, despite what a lot of the recovery community says. I know my motivations.

And to be honest, I stood in front of the beer cooler at work for a minute there other night, and I could go score now. And if I agreed with the""recovery people"" that I've already relapsed with subs, I probably would have gotten drunk or high by now.

So I just needed to write this out while I'm eating McDonald's and charging my phone to remind myself that things look a little fucked right now, but I'll best serve myself by not giving in and proving those busybodies from the sober house state org right.",1523035209.0

For some background, I’ve been on maintenance for close to 2 years now and for the majority of that time I was taking Suboxone, recently due to issues that I won’t get into I had to switch centers and after a lot of research I decided that Methadone would be the best bet for myself going forward.

During the switch between centers I had to wait about a week due to the new place not being able to take on a new client on short notice. During those 7 days I was using full agonists again to stave off withdrawals until I could start MMT. It has been 5 days now that I’ve been on methadone (currently on 50mg and going up until I can make it a full 24 hours without going into w/d) and as of now I feel like I made the right choice, however I have 90mg of oxycodone left from the week in between centers. My question is simple. Would I be able to get any benefits from taking the oxycodone while on methadone or would it be a waste? I just want to know if I’d be better off flushing them or taking them.

if i add 70% isopropyl alcohol to the tooter and let it dry on foil, will this waste any of the crack cocaine residue/resin/whatever you wanna call it? i've heard of people cleaning their H tooters like this. do I need to let the alcohol dry for a specific amount of time (smoking isopropyl alcohol could be deadly im sure) or can I just light it on fire and then dry the remaining product (say with a hair dryer, carefully, or by leaving the foil on a windowsill for a couple hours or over night) and smoke without problems?

(im high and sleepy but lets get philosophical),"i.e. street prices or higher

in theory i believe that most peoples addictions would end sooner .

prices continue to go up for pills

people beginning to charge $2/mg for pills.

and i don't blame them, i would too.

its pretty much the end now until a new beginning . what is the next phase? thats what i want to know
when fent is gone and its analogs
are rcs are unimportable
and people cannot afford $40 roxys
i think something is going to happen
something beneficial for people that like opiates
the govt. cannot ignore a signifigant percentage of the population that enjoys something so much that it puts a strain on their infrastructure

drugs should have never been made illegal, drugged driving sure, or acts comitted while on drugs should be an extra penalty and not a subtraction unless they are found to be  psychiatrically ill.

the government and our world wants to control every last thing that we do

from the food we grow down to what we eat and what we can view on the internet


the media is nonstop fearmongering propaganda and i have really about had it if i had the money id move to a country a little bit more sane. yes, other countries might be more strict or not prescribe opiates as much but if our healthcare systems main focus is not prescribing opiates than we have a major problem

that within itself is stupidity

ii cant get over the fact that some things are going to happen no matter what and government intervention only makes it worse yet each new president makes an attempt at doing something different


i dont like living to feel like i am restricted, bound to our countries moral code and stigma

ive been taking opiates since i was young

ever since i first enjoyed the feeling ive loved them


however


the most major factor in this is the mental cognition & physical control of ones ability to not feel the need to have the feeling that opiates gives you. once you let go of that, then you can actually use opiates however you'd like without really fucking up too much. always put your mind and body ahead of the drug no matter how far behind you think you are .

tl;dr
our countrys, and other countries most likely, laws make me feel like we live inside of a jail . 
why can't we have community gardens
why can't we build houses for one anothe
why can't we have free electricity distributed or created
why can't we do things together without having the government involved in every single FUCKING process of our lives
why do they allow a pharmacy in new york to charge $110 plus tax for a quarter gram marijuana oil cartridge that is less than 60% thc?
why does jeff sessions think that marijuana is worse than heroin?

Thailand is only going to have tramadol and benzos unless you've got a local who can speak Thai, as well as having a legitimate injury like a busted knee. When I go I'm going to have locals I know, so that makes a huge difference. I've never gone myself but several of my close friends have and they've scored, and I've been researching this for months, so take everything I say with a grain of salt.

As a chipper with previous years of dependency that's barely from the edge of dependency with my rate of use, whenever I'm in an off-use period I can't stop considering going on a drug holiday. I know I'll go eventually once personal stuff in my life works out (bored AF of living in the States), but every time I'm not using I can't stop thinking about it. I probably look at flight prices into [forced edit:Two main cities in SE Asia, one in Thailand and one in Cambodia] at least every other day.

Don't get me wrong, there are MANY reasons to want to go that would seriously peak my interest (all the temples and historical sights, the food, etc.), but the one that obviously draws me the most is the drug availability over there. There's ""happy pizzas"" throughout SE Asia, which are strong weed pizzas, shroom shakes/other food, pretty widespread opium/heroin use to the point that certain bars, especially in Cambodia and Laos, have straight up menus with opium on them, whether opium tea or a bag of opium. 

Between this and the ability to get tramadol, benzos, and soma from Thai pharmacies and fucking EVERYTHING from Cambodian ones, such as tramadol, benzos, soma, ritalin, full on morphine, sometimes oxycodone (Thai pharmacies will also have all of these without a prescription, but it depends and they're a bit more strict, like you need to actually have a visible injury to get morphine vials), hell even gabapentin, it's a drug user's paradise. Some pharmacies in Cambodia even sell freaking liquid ketamine for IV use, though it can be cooked down for snorting. 

It's all cheap as fuck too, though the opioid pills apart from tramadol are a bit expensive. $5 for 20mg old school OCs is cheap for the US, but in SE that's a shit ton of money for a pill. Opium can be found for like $15-30 per g for tourist prices, and supposedly real non-fent China White is like $10-25/g if you get a few grams of it. There's even still full on opium dens with smoked opium and opium tea if you know where to look, especially in Laos. 

Sure it's all illegal, but as long as you don't combust weed (it's shit weed anyways, you'll want to eat it on edibles) and don't carry your drugs on you all over the place (only consume it on the premises and try to cop from pharmacies near your apartment/hotel during the day, and be sure to head straight back with your drugs), it's quite unlikely you'll get caught. You can get a mock prescription for like $40 if you want to legally beat the possible forced piss testing at checkpoints, but that's only in certain cities like parts of Bangkok.

It's just like I figure that what's the point of barely scraping by in the West if you can live comfortably for like $600/month all included, and that's eating out every day. If you can get by with just benzos (it's like 100 valium 10s for literally $3, l o l) and half g of opium or like fucking 70% pure heroin for $15-30/g that's only like $1100/month total living costs. Many people here already pay that much for freaking rent, if not double that in certain cities.

Anyone else been over there or constantly consider taking the plunge? It's the kind of hedonistic thing our culture completely shuns, but I figure with my online teaching gig I could work like seriously just 20 hours per week and afford the $1100/month plus like $500 per month in savings. It just seems too good to be true, but it's absolutely true.

Especially in Cambodia/Laos you can bribe police for as little as $5-50 per cop. In Thailand they'll want like $300-500 each for a bribe, which is bullshit.",1522987130.0

Back story is I been addicted for 5 years to nothing but good old oxy. Seen it all change for the worse, fugazy pills are EVERYWHERE and #s on legit ones are through the roof. Time is now or never. I quit twice before around 3 yrs ago when I went to italy where i knew no one to ask for around a couple months each time. Both were cold turkey but this time it feels like it's too much I can't do it cold.  I'll have around 100 15s, 30 30s & 30 20s. I'd say I'm around 150 mgs a day. I also have 3 subs for the very, very end. My fiance who is an amazing wonderful woman is gonna hold my batch this time and despense them. I realized it's over for me when after I continously spent the money I saved up for over a house these past years and when I would get my batch I wouldn't feel any happiness anymore I would only think about how I'm fucking it all up. Anyway....if any of yall can help me out, When I'm in ur position I'll keep the goodwill going. 🙏🏻 ",1522982347.0

IR morphine has been the most consistent opiate I’ve used at anywhere from 30-120mg daily for a solid 6 years. I don’t anticipate being too sick at this pussy amount but I’m a fucking pussy and feel like I fucked up a little by taking it that consistent for the better part of a decade. Now I’m just hoping I can stay away from the cocaine and booze binges and get through this. ,1522976774.0

As the title says, I just threw away 10 months clean. I haven't been full on sober for these past 10 months, but I have stayed clean from dope. I've done more growing up and bettering myself in the last 10 months than I ever have in my life. I mean when I first switched to dope, I didn't give a fuck if I never woke up. 

I've dabbled with pills in the last 10 months though, on very special occasions. Recently started smoking weed again too after over a year  and a half off.

I don't really know what the point of this post is. Basically I feel like I can chip (yeah I know, I know, I told myself this when I first got into H) because things have gotten so much better for me over the last 2 years. I first switched from oxy to dope in 2014 because it seemed cost effective. I quickly spiraled down into the depths of a heroin addiction. I was suicidal, reckless, mixing benzos dope and coke regularly. I didn't see any friends or family for the first 6 months of 2016, I just stayed in my apartment and made up excuses why I couldn't come visit on holidays.

I quit dope the summer of 2016 thanks to 40mg of alprazolam, clonidine, and kratom. I was pretty set on my decision, I even got a shot of dilaudid in the ER two weeks after I quit dope because I had kidney stones. That rush reminded me why I loved opiates and threw my life away from dope. But I still stayed clean from opiates.

Two months after I quit dope, I had a seizure due to benzo withdrawal while I was driving with my girlfriend. At the time, this was my second seizure from benzo withdrawal. My parents got really suspicious since I live 4 hours away from them and they knew I've had an oxy problem back in 2012. Anyways, they find out I used to do heroin and boom, I get sent to rehab. At the time I was pissed because I had already quit dope, was falling in love with my girlfriend, and was happier than I'd been in years. Why go to rehab when shit is looking up ya know?

The first couple of weeks in rehab was hell. I told them during my intake that I've been taking 6mg Klonopin a day along with 60mg Temazepam. The psychiatrist tried to wean me off benzos in a week. After almost seizing during art therapy, they ""hooked me up"" and extended my taper 3 days. I met some cool people in rehab, learned a lot, had family week which was crazy but good. After 6 weeks, I will never ever forget that first day I was released. Taking a plane back home, I felt so vulnerable thrown into the world with no preparation on how to transition. 

I lived in a sober living and went to an IOP for 2 months. I was drug tested twice a week and what not. Then I moved in with my girlfriend and have been here ever since. I started dabbling with benzos again. I took xanax for one week straight and then stopped cold turkey because my parents were suspicious of me and I thought I'd get drug tested. 2 days after stopping only a week of xanax (doses never went above 3mg) lit a cigarette and boom, another seizure. I was all scraped up but so thankful my gf remembered I had asked to never take me to a hospital if I have a seizure. 

The seizure was unexpected because prior to that, I hadn't taken benzos for 5 months. Even now after over a year off daily benzos I will get a little bit of rebound anxiety 2 days after dosing.

I started hanging out with an old using buddy of mine. I started doing oxys again and my tolerance built so fast, we quickly switched to dope. So I'm using dope again, not physically dependent on it. My parents decide have me go to my old IOP and drug test. They watch you piss so I was fucked. Just about to finally graduate college and then had my relapse blow up in my face. Family crying, pissed at me, cut me off completely, no trust etc. (you guys know)

So since then I was clean from dope. I got drug tested once a week which moved to once every two weeks after 6 months. I found a job very quickly, paid my bills, paid my rent, and supported myself. I felt strong and independent. I still do and it blows my mind how far I've come. A few weeks ago, my gf found 150 of her mom's old Norcos. Now, I've been taking kratom every day since Dec 2016 so there is some cross tolerance. I very quickly found myself consuming 180mg of hydrocodone. Ran out within a week, and was grateful I didn't spend money on them. I went right back into the mindset that pills are a waste of money.

That was a few weeks ago and when I ran out I didn't have that sense of impending doom and panic like I used to. I think it's because facing reality isn't as hard as it used to be for me since my life has drastically changed and I actually look forward to a future and even want a future.

So yeah I scored some dope today, and it is some pretty good shit. I feel great off of the tiniest bit. I feel amazing, and don't really have much guilt. In a way I feel like I've earned it. I'm going to set up some strict rules for myself (heard that one before, I know) and have my gf help enforce them too. Like I can't buy dope for 2 months after this bag runs out. I can't use more than 3 times a week. 

Sorry for rambling all high haha. If you made it this far, then thank you. I just tried to type out like almost 4 years of shit and I don't think it turned out so good haha. But yeah, something feels different about chipping this time. I guess we'll see ",1522980354.0

I am wondering what the real difference is? I am pretty sure that polistrex is just the extended release version right? With that in mind would I need to take more to control tolerance or is the usual ~30-90mg still the right dose? And also would I need to take it earlier than the usual 30-45min before hand?

EDIT: I know the difference now, and that the package is stating that the polistrex per dose is equal to 30mg of hbr, but I am still wondering if I would need to take more and/or earlier to compensate the extended release.",1522979136.0
