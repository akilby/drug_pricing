I just finished driving 10 Hours north of a city in Canada, where I will either do a quick suboxone taper, or more likely just cold turkey.

I bought 6 200MG bags to bring with me yesterday, and ended up shooting 4 of them yesterday. So I bought two more today. I shot one yesterday at 12 pm, and another 200 mg around 14 hours later. I am about to shoot my second last bag.

I will start taking suboxone tomorrow, which I have a prescription for until the 9th. 8MG a day.

This prescription is from the city I came from so I will see if I can find a Dr. in this small town who will help with a suboxone taper.

If not, I will start a cold turkey with that remaining 200MGs left over. I may do micro doses at night so I can sleep, prolonging the cold turkey by a few days but making it much more bearable. so it's a combo between cold turkey and a taper/detox.

Wish me luck.

Let me know what you think of my plan.

Also, where can I score Lope in Canada? Does Wallmart carry it here?

So, I ordered from a vendor that got great reviews - pretty much 5/5 across the board.  I was stoked, since I figured dope heads know what's up.

Then I get the package and broke out a few lines and blew that shit, and it burned the fuck out of my sinuses.  I did one bag and hardly felt anything.  Then the second.

Now, there was so much powder in these bags, that I'd say it was equivalent to grinding up a Perc 10.

I sort of got high, but only for ~30-45 minutes.  I'm talking a 3 out of 10 experience here.  Shit was garbage, and I needed both bags.  Had I only gotten the single I ordered, I would have spent ~$25 on expensive cut.

I had thought that maybe there was still Suboxone in my system, so I wrote it off as a fluke.

**But then,** another package randomly came ~5 days later, with two more bags in it, of the same batch as the first.

My tolerance isn't very high since I don't often get down except with the help of a fellow redditor, and this time around I *definitely* didn't have any subs in my system.

And wouldn't you know, I had the exact same experience.

(I didn't ask for the second package, which kinda sketched me out a little, and while free shit is free shit, the quality was still garbage.)

In all of this, what *really* gets me is that people said it's *better* than other vendors out there.

---

I don't understand it.  Are these people buying from the Road still fucking with codeine, or are they getting high off half a Vicodin or something?

It just grinds my gears to see people jizzing their pants over absolute shit quality, and paying a fucking *premium* to get it.  Seriously, single bags (~100mg, cut) are costing $15-$25, and that's *before* the ~$10 shipping.

Yeah, $10 shipping to ship a few stamps sounds fair... *sure*...

I'm not sure if this applies to the ""pure"" heroin listings, but any input in that regard is certainly welcome.

Also, I realize I always have the option of not buying, and that no one's putting a gun to my head, but it's just a shame and I want to vent.

It's the same shit that happened/*is* happening with the pill game.  People need their fix and won't refuse spending an arm and a leg to get it.  I read someone on here say that blues are going for $50 to $60 a pop in their area.  That's fucking absurd.

But at least with blues you **know** what you're getting.

Fuckin' shitballs Lahey...

**TL;DR: I bought from a vendor that had great reviews pretty much across the board, and found it was total shit quality - a retarded amount of cut and very little actual dope. For the money I spent, I could have gotten 5x as high from medium-quality local stuff.  I figured online vendors would be top-notch in terms of quality, but that's not what I've experienced.**

She is very beautiful, but our relationship is terrible, and it had to end.

Up until a month or so ago, it had been 3 years since I had touched H. I've done a good amount since then, to escape the way I feel. I have been lying to myself for months that I am happy, so I have chosen something different...

...but alas, now that I am alone, I face an entirely new set of problems. I want to use because I am afraid that maybe someday I'll find I've made a terrible mistake, and at the same time know that if I go back to her I will continue to be miserable. Where will I find a place I am happy without drugs? Does that place exist for me? I have never IV'd before, but I want to buy a box of syringes. I want to cook as much as I can into one shot, plunge it into one of my many plump, accessible, virgin veins, and die in a warm, bone-crushing wave of opiate bliss.

I did at least 15 blues, 10 bars, 1 k-pin, and some coke/crack...It was a good night. I even remember leaving around 8am, pulling in my driveway and remember thinking...""man I'm tired as fuck...I'll just sit here a minute before going in..."" 

Next thing I remember is opening my eyes again,  the room being dark except for a small circle around the lightbulb on the ceiling, and a friend that I was letting stay with me taking my boots and pants off and wondering ""what the fuck was happening....*is...is he trying suck my dick*...why is he undoing my pants...why can't I move?!?"" I KNOW that sounds like a weird thing to be thinking...but I didn't know wtf to think, let alone what was going on. I couldn't move, I was hot, I was too out of it to care...*I closed my eyes*...I hear him say ""you're gonna be ok man, I just brought you inside...what hap...""

I woke up 2 FUCKING DAYS LATER...and couldn't figure out why he appeared so happy to see me wake up...""hey ++++, where are my clothes, why don't I have any pants on?"" ""*It's Wednesday Capn. I went outside around 1pm on Monday cuz I couldn't find you...You were slumped over the steering wheel in your truck.

Well we prepped our shots, me doing 2-3x the amount of him.  He's a small guy, but not that tiny compared to me.   I had  bit of a tolerance, but he didn't.  Still, I've seen the dose he took go fine for other people his size, and they didn't even pass out.

well he said he wanted to get a big dose, but apparently it was too much.  

After injecting, he said it felt good, nice and strong to get a nod from it.

Seeing as he was alright, I did my monster shot and got to my bed where I laid back.

About 3-4 hours later I awoke from a deep deep nod (i could have died)

but I looked to my right where he had been sitting and found him laid back on the bed with no breathing.

after about 3 minutes of CPR, I used a flash light to check his pupils and they were dilated, which was my first OH FUCK moment, no reaction to light at all.

So, being the non-ass hole I am I rushed him to the ER and stuck around to give his information to the ER workers and help contact his mother.

soon after, I was told that he was gone and had probably been dead for several hours as rigimortis was beginning to set in.  Narcan wouldn't have saved him apparently.

It's been really hard on me, It's been months and I still think about it at least 5 times a day and it makes me feel depressed because I feel like a horrible person who's at fault for what happened.  

I've been in touch with his mother since and we're on good terms after I explained everything that happened.

I could have maybe had time to get him to the ER so they could administer narcan, but I was on the verge of death at the time he was unconcious too, so all I can think is why couldn't I just have died with him, but I know that sounds stupid and unnecessary to think about.

It just kills me to know his mother lost a child just a few years ago, and now this...  

how can I not feel like a scumbag?  I've been trying to tell myself not to keep blaming myself but I can't get past it.

OR

maybe i deserve the self-ridicule, but I feel that will just lead me back to doing heroin again, and that's unacceptable.  I need to stay clean for my friends mother so she knows the same thing won't happen to my parents, and If i stay clean perhaps my friends passing will keep me alive to help others with the same issues.

I believe they are regarded as matrix in design, not reservoir. 

Being a business woman, I did not want to slap one of these on and nod off all day or OD. After doing quite a bit of research and determining that for the Mylan patch, the medication is actually imbibed evenly in the silicon glue that sticks to your skin, hence no danger if you have to cut these patches for less medication. 

I have cut these patches into 5 sections with a clean exacto knife, and I have worn 1 of these strips (roughly 10-12 mcg of Fentanyl) for 36 hours. Even pain management, no respiratory depression at all, no OD symptoms, slightly sleepy until a fresh cup of Peets Kona coffee from whole beans I grind.


I can say with certainty, you can cut a Mylan matrix style Fentanyl patch into strips if you are uncomfortable with the amount of medication prescribed.  NEVER puncture a reservoir style patch with the intention of wearing it. Only Fentanyl patches that have the medication actually mixed evenly into the glue of the flat patch can allow a 'breaking up' of the medication. 

EDIT: FYI to people who are concerned, Mylan matrix style patches are just like thin, clear bandaids. The medication is evenly mixed into the silicon glue, hence there is no likely danger of there being more medication in certain areas of the patch then others.

Here is a nice website that aided my research, it describes which patches can be handled this way, and which cannot, as well as accurate doses of medication per brand/size of patch. http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showwiki.php?title=Fentanyl",1375503957.0

So, I was just about the make switch over to sub, and I got a call from a friend of mine who I have been encouraging to come visit me in my new town-he booked a last minute ticket and is coming on Tuesday (the 6th) and will be here until the 16th-10 days.  He knows I ""used"" to have a habit, but he is very anti dope/shooting. He's one of those hypocrites who is totally cool with buying and snorting a roxi or whatever else he can get his hands on, but dope is a ""junky drug"" to him.  So, I'm going to have to hide my use from him.

Now, the first couple of weeks I'm on sub I'm a right miserable bastard, so that option is out the window. I could just try to get enough dope to last 2 weeks and take a couple shots a day while I'm ""showering"" or in my room after we go to bed, but that would probably cost a fortune.

I remember that I got a script for tramadol once when I was on about 2mg of sub a day, and although I didn't get high, it kept the sickness at bay and I was able to just not take my subs at all for a couple of weeks.
My habit is about double what it was then-I do about 1g of shitty BTH a day, a bun of decent NYC ECP, or .3g of silk road dope a day to have a good day.

I have access to silk road and about $500 worth of BTC, and I can cop mediocre BTH anytime for $10 a point. (I'd like to avoid the BTC because even when I don't miss, it tends to leave worse tracks/obvious marks, probably because the nasty cut is frying my veins.)

Anything else y'all can think of? I'd love to be able to take a couple of pills a day and just be good, but I know I'd need at least 2 OP 80's a day, and they are at least $60 a pop on SR. If I'm gonna spend that much, I'd rather just do dope.

I am on Suboxone, and have to go to a clinic every day to get it. I just skipped 3 days in a row waiting for this goddamn package, so I had to go back today per the clinic's rules. I am prescribed 16mgs (I know it's a lot, *I don't want any shit for it please)*.

I managed to scrape most of the suboxone from underneath my tongue before it dissolved too much. I swallowed that, since the nurses were watching me like a hawk and i couldn't get it out of my mouth. I'd say that only about 4mgs was actually able to dissolve sublingually. 

**My question is this**: Out of the +/- 12mgs that I swallowed, how much do you think made it into my system? One of the nurses had mentioned previously that suboxone does not absorb well if ingested. I'm not sure if that's true, and I know I can google it but I'm looking for personal experiences or advice.

i hit my dude up for a quarter g last night.  he needed the money in advance and said he'd hook it up.  he doesn't usually ask for money in advance but when he does, he will indeed hook it up.  that was at 10 after 11.  i didn't hear from him for the rest of the night.

i gave my friend a ride from one side of town to the other and back at 1 in the morning to pick up 5 grams of ice and he gave me 35 dollars.  (he offered ice but i didn't want any.  i did a little bit the preceding morning and it was more than enough...not a huge fan of being up for long periods of time)  we had a nice time riding and talking but god damn.... 5 grams of meth in my car in the middle of the night on a friday/saturday?  fuck man.  sketch city.

went to bed sad at 5 am.  got up at 9 to go to work.  get to work to find out my prep partner (i do prep in a pizza place.  making/rolling pizza dough, chopping veggies, whatnot.  it's just me and this one other guy.  we've gotten pretty close)  got shot in the arm by a narcotics officer last night while they were raiding the trap house he sold bud and coke out of.  they found lots of cash, bud, coke, and some guns.  he was already a convicted felon so i'm pretty sure i won't be seeing my pizza rolling buddy ever again.  we had so much fun making pizza dough together over the last year man.  he made that job fun.  i'm pretty sad about that.  also what's normally a short shift turned into an extra long shift because i had to do all the prep by myself today.  more hours at least....  also got a sort of promotion(lots more hours and a potential raise) because along with losing him, 2 other guys in the kitchen have quit in the last 2 days.

i have court on monday for a ""leaving the scene of an accident"" thing that happened.  that's another story for another day.  let's just say i was texting and driving through a residential area and hit a parked truck.  i did 0 damage to the truck and the owner didn't give a fuck.  but my dumbass still called the cops on myself and landed myself in court.  that will be monday morning.  my mom called me to let me know my probation officer called her the other day letting her know i had been warranted for not going to see my PO.  Sooooo I gotta go to court on monday morning with a warrant.  probably gonna go to jail.  i told my boss and he was pretty pissed at me.  but he still wrote a letter to the judge about how great of a guy/employee i am.  also my mom is going to come to court too and she's been known to get me out of jams before.  (i just want it known that i was on probation for ""reckless driving"" which was actually a dui i had gotten reduced.  only thing is i was riding a motherfucking bicycle when i received said dui.  yes.  i got a dui on a bicycle.  i wasn't even swerving around.  i just ran a red light in front of a cop.  fucking bullshit.  1200 dollar fine that i had no hopes of paying.... so yea.  fuck going to see my probation officer.  i'm super responsible i know.  don't judge me.)

i cried a lot at this point.  i just want to get high.  i tried to call my dude that took my money last night again.  and he finally fucking answered.  he was apologizing profusely and saying he should be straight sometime this evening and for the trouble he will be hooking me the fuck up.  still waiting on that but i'm not sick so it's not that bad.  still wish he'd hurry the fuck up.  

i was pretty happy about that and rode my bike the 8 miles home.  i get home and check my phone to see a text message from an old friend.  he's telling me that another old friend of ours passed away last night.   she had lots of health problems and treated her body like shit so really no one is surprised.  the general consensus is she od'd but obviously we won't know for sure until we see the autopsy/toxicology results.  i didn't see her too often lately.  maybe once every couple months, but she was a sweetheart.  RIP girl. 

so now i'm just sitting here.  my phone is blowing up with all my old buddies asking if i've heard the news.  i hate when a friend passes away but it's always nice to reconnect with old friends (and old connections, let's be honest....) hopefully dude calls me soon and tells me to get my ass on my bike and hooks me the fuck up for all the trouble he's put me through the last 20 hours.  i really didn't think he was ripping me off but the thought entered my mind a few times.  he really is a stand up dope dealer. (of course the number one thing on my mind with this shit storm going on around me is getting my tar and doing a fat[not too fat now... i ain't gonna be trying to see what my old friend is doing yet...]  shot.

i'm fucking tired man.  and i'm hungry.  and i'm really sad and pissed off.  i'm so used to people dying by now that it's just become an ""oh that sucks... time to move on"" thing for me.  especially after my ex girlfriend died in a drunk driving accident a few months ago.  we were still really close and talked almost everyday.  i lost it over that one and i've lost it over a few other ones but right now i'm just so numb.  i should just turn my phone off and go to sleep.  

but we all know that's not going to happen.

sorry this story sucks so bad.  i really didn't even feel like writing it.  but i had to.  i just needed to talk to you guys and i knew it....  love yall.  be safe.  i'll update after court/when i get out of jail(which won't be more than a couple days if i do go... misdemeanor traffic bullshit)  

EDIT:  i just wrote a really long edit about how little i appreciate being judged and insulted on this subreddit.  it had bullet posts and everything but somehow disappeared.  what ever.  I come to this sub because i feel like i can tell you guys stuff i can't tell most people without being made to feel like an asshole.  I'm a weekend heroin user (sometimes it spills into the week but mostly during the week i just take a quarter of a sub a day to get by).  This is mostly because I'm poor.  I had a decent job at one point but fucked it up and landed my ass in a part time prep gig in an italian place.  9 bucks an hour part time isn't anywhere close to a living wage.  i have been looking for other work for a while now but with the recent developments at work i got bumped up to close to full time.  still want to get a second part timer to supplement my income, buy a car, move out of the shit hole flea trap i stay in, buy my wonderful girlfriend the gifts she deserves, etc.... I WILL MAKE THIS HAPPEN. I make bad decisions when it comes to being on probation.  I've barely been in trouble in the last 7 years.  i got an actual car DUI in 2006.  since then it's all been stupid shit like bicycle DUI reduced to reckless driving (reckless pedalling?!?!?), the leaving the scene of an accident, and a few probation violations.  btw, [this](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/24/14653300-cash-register-justice-private-probation-services-face-legal-counterattack?lite) is the privately owned probation company in my county.  They used to be state wide but got in a lot of trouble after some scandalous shit happened and they closed every single one in the state.  except one.  the one in my county.  they really are the scum of the earth.  I've been under those assholes thumb since got a reckless driving FIFTEEN YEARS AGO!  it's a debtors prison with ultra high interest rates (33 dollars a month, whether you make payments or not.  So if you can't afford to pay your fine then you just rack up that 33/month. (just under 400 bucks a year,  i've doubled my fines because of this.  the place is a debtor's prison, which i thought was illegal.  sorry i'm rambling.

what i'm trying to get across here is i'm a good guy.  my family loves me and i have an amazing woman i would do anything for and would do anything for me.  She and I are pretty madly in love.  I don't like people who don't even know me trying to judge me based on a few pages of stories that I told y'all for your entertainment.  I want to spark some discussion, get other people telling their similar stories.  Some people go along with it.  Others want to fling insults and make assumptions about who i am based on these glimpses into my life.

so come on guys.  let's be friends here.  there's enough trolls coming from outside the board judging us/being cunts.  I love most of yall and love to read about everyone's highs and lows.  i hope yall love reading mine too.  sorry about the rambly rant.  my dude finally came through and tossed me some kpins as consolation.  He's also gonna toss me a couple extra points tomorrow so i can save my half sub for if/when i go to jail.  wish me luck guys and gals.  PEACE!

She only has 60 on her, so she tells him that she will drive him to her apartment complex.

When my friend and his connect go inside the apartment complex, she whips out a gun and tells him to take off his pants and give it to her. So he does, with the rest of the money + all the OC's + his cellphone.

I get a call from a random number, I pick it up and it's my friend telling me to pick him up.. I thought he was fucking with me when he told me that he got robbed. I picked him up and he was pants-less (I started laughing), then the realization of my lost of $1200 hit me...

What made it worst was the fact that I was trying to pick up that many because I am leaving for San Francisco to Baltimore tomorrow (8/4) and I didn't want to go through withdrawals while going to work in San Franciscolin..

I'm looking for another opinion on my method of kicking. 

Long story short, I've worked my way down from smoking fent' daily and taking 10 or more tramadol just to catch a little buzz. I've been taking the tramadol for a few years now with hardly any breaks. When I started Sub, I was at 1-3 trams a day. That was 5 days ago. I've been rationing the hell out of my only Sub strip.

I'd say I have at least 3 more doses of Sub before its all gone.

It used to be fire every time, but I think he's starting to cut it himself. I hear a lot of people talk about cutting H with some sort of sleep-aid, and I've noticed that instead of nodding out, I basically feel like I just took some Ambien, no euphoria or nodding, no itching at all. I'm not even getting that vinegary smell to it anymore. It's gotten to the point where I feel like I'm wasting my money. Instead of railing 2-3 bags, I'm using 6-7 anytime I want to get high (and not even getting high anyway), and it's not my tolerance either. I can still rail 2-3 bags when he gets it straight from his dealer and meets me. He's always using the excuse of ""I don't have anymore of those stamps I gave you last time, just this new stamp of _____, I don't know if they are any good.""

Not sure what to do. I'm a college student with a part time job, and absolutely none of my friends or family have any idea I use heroin, so it's not like I can go asking around if anyone knows anyone who's selling. No one even takes opes of any kind. I'm just ranting, wondering if anyone here has had this problem before, and what you've done about it. I'm in a large east coast city, so it's not like there's no other dealers, I'm just not really willing to go meet some dude in the hood to get my kicks.",1375556006.0

1jmxsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1jmxsl/what_a_shitty_day/,8,https://redd.it/1jmxsl,samsironpoker,What a shitty day,"Last night I was out with a few friends who had all been drinking. I had taken my normal amount of opiates (with absolutely no alcohol) and I felt completely normal walking around the park with them. They asked me to drive them home then I could take their car back to my place and drop it off in the morning (I rode my bike to her house). I dropped them off at home fine, then on the way to my house it hit HARD. Started nodding harder than I ever have before. Like the idiot I am, I probably took too high a dose after a ""tolerance break"" (unwanted w/ds). It was only hydrocodone. I should have been fine. I was concentrating as hard as I could, occasionally slapping myself in the face to stay alert. I know guys, I should have called a cab or something. I know I'm an idiot. I was in the far left lane of a three lane road when the guy next to me, who had probably been drinking, swerved a little into my lane. I over corrected, hit the median with full force and pretty much took a tree down with me. 

I feel like such shit. It's not my car. My cousin is some big wig at Honda and he said if we got it fixed privately it'll only cost about $1,000. That I don't have. I'll be paying this off for years unless I drop out of college. 

These guys told my parents who are now freaking the fuck out. Luckily they only think it was PST (which for some reason is better in their minds). I just hate that they are now treating me like a lowlife lying drug addict. Saying they'll never trust me again. Saying ""Oh so that's why you've been so nice to us the past few months, it's just the drugs!"" They are divorced, they both have told me separately that they think I hate them. I mean, I don't like them sometimes but damn, they're my parents. I have to love them, right? I love my brother so much, he's the only one supporting me. I don't know what I'll do when he moves away.

I'm just so grateful no one is threatening me with rehab. I do have to go to therapy though :/  I'm a third year psych major, I know all the routine questions and every standard answer this bitch is going to give me. 

I'm sorry for the rant guys. I can't really tell anyone else the entirety of what's happening. The accident might have happened anyway, I can't know for sure. But it's awful when you know the only thing you need right now is the only thing you can't have. 

TL;DR Crashed a car that wasn't mine, owe money I don't have, parents treating me like scum

I haven't gotten high since Sunday or Monday, at least. My whole body is fucking agitated and tense-- I'm not sick, I'm just in panic-attack mode and I have been for the last week. Stupid depression, stupid anxiety, stupid fucking USPS fucked up my medication. I can't handle anything right now. 

I don't have any money-- I mean, I had to steal change from my roommate for bus fare to get to the clinic. I can just imagine having to miss my fucking dose because I can't find $1.25. Forget about food, or cigarettes, or booze. I'm rolling pennies and down to my last .50 cents. 

I haven't worked in over a year because of anxiety/depression issues. I can barely drag myself out of the fucking house anymore. 

My source of income suddenly dried up when I stopped getting my suboxone through a regular doctor and had to start getting it through the methadone clinic. Unfortunately, this happened very suddenly and I was expecting another month's worth, at least, of a regular script. So now I'm fucked with the only people I know who I could get anything off of--they all think I pulled a scam on them or something, since I had used the promise of my refill to get some dope fronted. Now I can't pay them back and they are all on my ass about it and I *can't do anything* about it except tell the clinic that I have to go out of town for a couple days, so they give me take-homes. But 2 days of take-homes is not going to cover my debt, and I'm really new there and I doubt they'll give them to me anyway. 

All week long I've been waiting on one thing or another. My package got fucked up, my Subs got fucked up, and my other $ script also got fucked up and I can't get that until Monday now (it was due this past Wednesday). 

My roommate is pissed off at me because I can't contribute anything to the house right now. I don't want to deal with my family because I have nothing good to say. My ""friends"" are all dead or gone, or not really friends. This methadone clinic thing is seriously fucking with my head-- it's fucking demeaning that they make everyone go stand about it a dingy little hallway waiting for their medicine, monitoring everything you do and even checking your fucking mouth to make sure that you've taken your dose. I'm 30 fucking years old. 

I just want to be put into suspended animation until I have money or drugs in my pocket. Otherwise, even stepping out of the house to check the mail makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack. 

Whatever. Sorry to be so negative. I don't have anywhere else to vent.

of course, this is after i stole the $40 - something I don't do, even for weed, and weed is my main bitch.

scored, and I wasn't even two blocks away  when my body relaxed, and I could drive back home without wanting to murder whosoever should stray across my path.

Mainly, I had no urge to get mega-fucked up nor do damage to my liver. However, and probably needless to say, the urge to drink became nonexistent since the opiate high is a million times better, feels cleaner, etc.

Fast-forward to now and I'm pretty much off the opiates. Downgraded from oxy to hydro, from hydro to less hydro, and now just tramadol (use for pain but mostly was prescribed to wean myself off the real opiates). Anyway, I've drank a few times since this change in prescription seeing as I don't have any APAP in my system anymore....yet, well...it's been weird. I drink and I don't get buzzed, like...at all. I don't know. I become sedated, but barely. There is absolutely no good buzz and basically, no reason to drink anymore. I'm not getting anything out of it (I mean, I do enjoy a good beer or wine just for taste too, but as far as the added element that they're drugs - nothing).

Has anyone else lost their desire and ability to receive joy from alcohol after having done opiates? I'm wondering if it's a chemical thing (maybe I just haven't been off them long enough yet for my brain to reset itself to normal, you know, like how a normal human being likes booze), but I'm also wondering if it's deeper than that. Maybe just tasting a substance that is so much better than everything else will set your standards for intoxication higher, forever, and ruin your chances of enjoying a simpler substance you used to frequent. Like I said, I am on tramadol, so maybe it's a brain-not-back-to-completely-normal kind of thing (I'm not drinking on the tram).

Also, I just might not be drinking enough. I've done the casual drink a few beers kick. Haven't tried the old slam a few shots down shit, maybe that'll work. I'm not complaining really, it's totally fine not enjoying alcohol as a drug. After a drink or two, it's not like it's a positive thing for your body or anything. I'm happy to take one more unhealthy habit out of my life. I just think it's weird and I'm curious if anyone has experienced any similar outcomes from opiate or even other drug use, I guess.

My research concludes that you should never heat pills during prep, due to binders and waxes dissolving into the water. I crush finely, add ice water, let sit for a couple minutes, stir, filter twice and go. I end with an almost perfectly clear solution that provides a nice rush and long lasting high.

And I will say that no matter the answer, I have no judgements towards any of you. I am presenting you with the question because I think I found something out about myself and my habit (Oxy) that I hadn't previously known.  
  

**Hypothetical Situation:**  
  
You are 24 hours into opiate withdrawals and you're as dope-sick as can be. Circumstances present an opportunity and you've scored 1 opiate pill. Now this opiate pill is your typical drug of choice and it's the magic number of milligrams that will not only stop you from being dope-sick, but it will also get you high. The catch is that you have to take this pill orally and it's the only one you can get for 2 weeks (meaning that you will not be able to do any other opiate whatsoever for 2 weeks). You're in the bathroom urinating and as you go to wash your hands, your hands bump the pill and it falls right into the toilet. You reach in immediately and grab the pill out of the toilet water when you realized that you just finished urinating in the water your pill just fell into.  


**Do you...**  

*A) Decide eating a pill with piss isn't worth feeling better as well as getting high and just flush the pill anyway*  

*B) Leave the urine-soaked pill sitting on the counter as you search your thoughts on how to ""clean"" the pill which eventually leads to you eating the pill*  

*C) Eat the pill as soon as your hand comes in reach of your mouth because a little piss is better than being dope-sick/sober*   

*D) Other - Please explain*  
  


Again, no judgement here. And yes, I know that this scenario isn't necessarily realistic. I made the parameters as such (i.e. it has to be taken orally, can't take any opiates for 2 weeks, it's milligram content is magically attuned to your tolerance level to allow you to be high) so that you are forced to make an uncomfortable decision.  
  
My Answer To This Hypothetical Situation When I first began pondering this question, I literally spent 20 minutes attempting to make a decision. I eventually decided that my answer to the hypothetical question would be ""A) Decide eating a pill with piss isn't worth feeling better as well as getting high and just flush the pill anyway."" However, it was then that I realized that the simple fact that I spent 20 minutes pondering eating a urine soaked pill before making up my mind of ""no"" is extremely revealing to me and the effects of Oxycodone on my mind. And after thinking about it more, I began to realize that I determined that I would say ""no"" because I am currently on Oxycodone and I am far from being dope-sick. While at this very moment I am high and not dope-sick, I (and my brain) am not extremely desperate to feel better and I am not jonesin' really bad either. With that realization, I realized that I probably would not have immediately flushed or thrown the pill away. What would likely have happened instead is that I would have grabbed paper towels and attempted to dab off the pill without destroying or crumbling it. From there, I would probably even try sitting it in some rice to try and get the most amount of moisture possible. I would then probably constantly smell it in attempts to convince myself that there was no more urine on the pill. Even if I did end up not consuming the pill, I am sure that it would not have been discarded and I would have spent many hours attempting to clean or sanitize it without compromising the pill's strength. And with that kind of desperation, I more than likely would end up taking the pill that had been dropped in a recently used toilet.  
  
This little thought-experiment revealed a side to me that I don't think I realized was there. For the record, I am not condemning this as a horribly negative thing. It's not a negative for anyone who answers ""yes"" nor is it necessarily a positive if you choose ""no"". What it is though, is a piece of information about yourself that you can then use to evaluate yourself as well assess the current state of your opiate hobby/addiction/dependence.  
  
If you are going to participate (which I hope many of you do), please be absolutely honest and DO NOT JUDGE others here for the decision they believe they would make.

Should I try to not grind it up as much? I tried to get it as fine as possible for better absorption. It did still get me high but no where close x2 as high as eating it.

Some IV Diamorphine goes great with a nice vintage Burgundy hell I like to do a speed ball here and there.

Polypharma is one of my self medicating fortes.

But I have to say one of the greatest euphoria I've ever felt came during the come down on a low dose of MDMA.

I had taken enough to have biiiig pupils and a nice body buzz and general lovey feeling, with out and tweaked out sensations or habits.
A girl I know called me over to the condo her daddy pays for.  

. This girl really was beautiful and took very good care of her appearance and had a nice bubble butt. A nice ass is equal to a large dose of viagara to me as I can rarely get it up on MDMA.

After I served pipe she passed out so I went to her kitchen and chopped up some lines of Heroin (before my IV days).

 SNUFFFF ahhh yea there's that nice little burn that lets me know all is well in the world. Nothing is better than doing heroin when your a junkie. Heroin takes everything and gives nothing in return. But that's what us junkies seek isn't it? That nothingness... 
I took a piss and headed back to her room where she lay sleeping. Flipped on the television and put on some reruns of who knows what. I spent the next two hours watching the sun rise as I felt waves of pleasure slither down from my brain extending out through my nerves and lighting up every part of my body in ecstasy.

To be honest I will never come down from a stimulant again with out and opiate, and then possibly a little benzo as a night cap when I am ready to zzzzzz


Heroin normally serves as a sensory deprivation tank, but this combo really gave me something different.

I consider myself a pretty honest person these days (and can be vouched for by a few people on here) but there was a point in my life when i would beat anyone for almost anything (worth $20 at least) This is a story of one of those days.


I was bored sick and sitting in my closet at the local ymca. I only had one phone connect at the time and he was a suburban kid about 3 years younger then me. I had a few open air markets within walking distance of the Ymca so i thought i can burn this suburban dope dealer, we will call him M. So i call a girl up and ask her if she wants to make a bun, duh she does and agrees to drive. I call M and order 5 bun and tell him to put them in a cig pack cuz my ride can't know I'm getting D. 

15 minutes later my girl scoops me and we head to the burbs. I tell her that I'm just gonna beat the kid up if i have to, but prefer not to. I call and try to get him to meet at a park, he tells me to go to his house, and he'll be outside, i haggle over price for a min and tell him ill be there in 5. I'm panicking a little at this point as he has roommates and im not a fan of getting my ass kicked by 3 dudes while sick. My girl gives me $15 in ones to use as flash cash if needed.

we pull up and M is outside by himself. i get out of the car and he has the dope filled pack in his hand. i walk up and raise my hand to slap hands but instead in one smooth motion grab the cig pack, turn around and run 5 ft to the car and hop in. Me and the girl ride off into the sunset where we proceed to get mangled, she forgets the 15 she gave me so i can afford cigs. Like an ass i use all the dope by 7 am the next day.

I've been reading about your potential cross country tour and while I'll be unable to join for the journey, I thought I'd pass along a resource that might be of help for you.  A few of my friends did this in college for a group tailgating vehicle they would drive across the midwest to various football games.  

What they did was they purchased a used school bus!  Once the busses hit a certain amount of miles or school districts get money for a replacement they sell the old ones at a very cheap price for what you're getting.  Here is the site that you can purchase buses from in North Carolina but I'm certain you can search for any state and find a similar sale site.  

http://ncschoolbussales.dpi.state.nc.us/

It's not super cheap (2 or 3k from what I saw when i quickly glanced), but one thing to look at is that if you guys ever get stranded or have to hitch, instead of having a rented vehicle you'll be able to sell the bus and use the money to help hitch, get provisions...., and all things of the sort.

Along with that, plenty of recreational drugs (which for a long time never really included opiates), and amounts of whiskey that would make drunk uncle worry a little more about his own drinking.

At some point I tried opiates, and was really high, and loved the warmth I felt.  So I did them again, and at some point my body became addicted, and I started feeling differently about them.  I drink very rarely, I smoke weed much less, and generally get inebriated less, if I'm inebriated on preferably h, but any other good ones are ok too.  I also stopped taking amphetamines.  The antidepressants I do think worked at one time, hindsight is 20/20, and I was a child when I was given huge amounts of prescription medication.  Xanex, Klonopin, Dexadrine, Concerta, Adderall, Wellbutrin, Pristique, Effexor, Zoloft, Paxil, this blue time release ball capsule for ADD, like Selexa or something when I was around, 15 and two months old.  This wasn't so much supervised or monitored by my parents as I think they figured, a doctor is prescribing me medicine that is going to help me ""get better"" about being an angsty teenager.  

I was and am, definitely depressed, and I feel like in some senses I have made some peace with that, that it's kind of just how I am wired.  Not ""mis-wired"", or wrongly wired, I just have a blue disposition.  That's a nice way to say it, like my mom saying I'm not fat I'm big boned.  

Anyways, I would like to come out of the closet, as a ""recreational"" drug user.  I have been through tons of different psychiatrists, simply because they moved a lot, and I feel like they never really understood what they were prescribing me, or how it really effected me.  I grew to understand that my treatment, especially the aspect of medicines as a process that I, in the end, should be in control of.  I am the person who has to live with this brain, I should be able to have a pretty big say in the medicine I take, and some of my doctors felt similarly.  

Opiate therapy, which I think is a nice and honest way to put it, is working for me.  I am happy, doing well at my job, I have been good to my family and friends and excited to be around them.  I feel like opiates have worked better than any antidepressant I have ever been prescribed, and have lowered the doses of all the medicines I take.  I believe it is my right as a human being to put substances in my body that make me happy, and I don't bother anyone else.  If we don't have the right to do with our own bodies, in our own spaces, when it neither harms nor effects other people, than we have no business calling ourselves free.

I've been taking tea every day for...I dunno, almost a year? Couple misses but pretty much everyday. I make a small batch before I go to work a quarter of a pound, and than I make a bigger batch as soon as I get off.

How much does it cost to get some suboxone? Is that the way to go? I have 2 weeks to kick, and I can't let anyone know. And let's just say, the will to go through withdrawl isn't there when I know tea is cheap. But I can not do this because of a new job.

So not only did it take me forever to actually get the needle (31g, like a 1-inch needle) to hit a vein, when I actually did register and hit the plunger, that feeling...

... just wasn't pleasant.  I felt light-headed and my vision kinda went staticky.  I felt like I had to sit the fuck down.

So now I have a hole in the crutch of my arm (failed) and 2 in my hand.  For what?  A totally *meh* experience.

But hey, at least now I know *for sure* it's not something I like.

Anyone else have a similar experience with IVing their first go around?

---

EDIT: I got 2 bags (of east coast powder heroin) left and some scrapies. Does anyone recommend plugging? I got an oral syringe I could stick up my butt.  I heard it's great w/ morphine, but alas I've never come across morphine.

If the rush is similar to IVing though, maybe I won't.

This is my first actual post on Reddit (chronic replier here). I'm a 15 year vet of the dope game, so I'm usually the one who gets ASKED for help IRL, but I need some help and a few of you are even more knowledgeable than me.

Here's the situation. After using heroin for 15 years, I needed to quit after the birth of my second son, it was just time. So for the last 2 years I have been taking suboxone. I've gotten down to about 4mg/day IV. I know IV'ing suboxone is dumb, but my problem is that I'm buying them on the street and can only afford to buy 3-4 a week. Pennsylvania is a motherfucker when it comes to helping addicts and the doctors charge 300 for a 1st visit and then 75-100 for the monthly visit. On top of that the subs themselves are like $9/strip. I just can't afford that. I qualify for medical assistance but for some reason it's hard to get approved to get your subs paid for with it. This is what I'm told-that it's a pain in the ass and it's alot of hoops to jump through.

Anyway, I can't keep shooting these things. My veins are a mess and my arms/hands look worse than when I was doing dope. It takes me a half hour to find a half useable vein and even then I miss half the shot.If I start taking them sublingually am I gonna be sick or will there be enough bioavailabile to keep me well. I tried plugging them but I'm afraid I did it wrong and didn't really feel it like everybody says I should. I didn't have an oral syringe so I used a regular one with the tip broke off. Also since it only held 50 units of water I wasn't sure if it was diluted enough, if I got it in far enough, or if I was so constipated (u guys know how subs are...lol) it didn't absorb well. I'm a straight male so I'm very unfamiliar with the science of sticking things up my ass.

Am I truly better plugging it and if/so is there anything that would make it innefective?

Should I just start taking my 4mg sublingually? ANd how bad will I feel until my body gets used to it? Is there anything I can do to potentiate it?

Better yet, Is there a super garden-hose sized vein I'm not aware of that has escaped me all these years? I'm athletically built 5'9"" 175 and know about the femoral vein in my groin but i CANNOT find my pulse to guide me.

I'd appreciate any help guys. I'm sitting here scratching a hole in my hand becaused I missed a shot in my hand. The blood was registering me, but as usual the whole shot burned and now I'm itchy like I have scabies. It's like my friggen veins leak or something. I just can't do this anymore.

Welp- I went all day without subs yd to try and get my tolerance down to where the 4 mg sublingual will do the job. I felt ok yd, just fatigued. Woke up this morning and NOW I'm sick. Sitting here trying to figure out whether to put my 4mg today under my tongue, up my butt, or in a vein. Or try to suffer through one more day to get tolerance down. Decisions decisions.

All 8 days of my vaction completely clean after a 20+ mg of opana a day for about a month and a half.  I feel like getting noddy so i Call my dude over and he says he has a surprise.  He now has new hook up  (and i have no clue how) 300 of the new generic opanas that are the same formula as the old stop signs.  Since ive moved back home all that is around is 30's for thirty to thirty five a pop ( obsurd) or a E40 opana 55 to 65 bucks a pop. I moved back to nebraska after a year of being in oregon where i had easy access to probably the best BTH ive personally been able to experience.   So please spare me lectures and warnings of the bad shit that comes along with doing those E40's i am aware of how terrible it is to IV and know im a moron and its an extreme risk each time.  Old habits die hard.  However, this is why im in such high spirits, i now have easier access to the better and much safer opanas.  No more E40's anymore!

These facebooks are on point, even though the count could be larger, like always. Pure white, nice bitter taste, and good legs. Only sniff so no rush. The best part is the connect is one of the most respectful and punctual people ive ever met, dboy or otherwise. He treats me with respect and understands thats what gets repeat customers. I have no reason to go anywhere else, he takes care of me and makes me feel like family. Everyone wins. Its such a nice change of pace from getting yelled at on the phone because i dont understand a spanish accent well, and certainly dont know all the streets in the hood by heart. All the other dealers around here act like their shit doesnt stink, will make you wait forever because you need them, and talk down to you like their some sort of superior. Just makes me appreciate my dude with the facebooks even more. Anyways. Hope everyone had a great night!

Crack head, crack head - Sketchy dude!

Drive back north with sweaty back, 

Restless legs and rumbling crack. 

Crawl in bed to sweat and toss, 

Think about the things I've lost. 

In the bathroom for some Lopes - 

Then at least my guts can cope! 

From the corner of my eye, I spot something and nearly cry, 

A long white bar quarter cut - dropped while I was fucked up.

All of my previous guys were pretty much the same until I met my new guy. He is incredibly punctual and strict about meeting up. If he says to meet him at 4:30, he will be there at 4:25, no doubt about it. But he expects the same from you. If you aren't there by 4:32, he leaves and you'll have to try again another day (he will make exceptions for some people if they have a good excuse). He shoots me a text every morning letting me know if he has anything or not so I never need to ask and 9/10 times he's got something. He has also introduced me to new opiates on a few occasions and always gave me dosage and ROA suggestions (Probably because he doesn't want customers dying on him lol)

With all of the shitty people I've dealt with before, this guy seems like a god-send.

Personally I am gutted, fucking love the furry ones. But, we now know to expect recurring vets bills that we just cant afford. I would do anything to keep them, but know my wife is right.

So, I am sad as fuck. But brought a shit ton of H to cheer me up.

We have a week before they go, so I plan on spending as much time as possible with them both.

Edit: I have just been told we have found a permanent home for them at a cat sanctuary dedicated to cats that struggle to be rehomed. It has acres of land and hundreds of cats that will never be put down. They can live their lives their happily. 

The only downside to this cat paradise is we can never see them again. Its a secret place that take in cats that are supposed to be put down. Some anti animal putting down place ran by a vet who disagrees with animals being put down. The RSPCA do not know it exists,  and would probably try to close it if they did. Then put the cats down.... sick fucks at the rspca. Never liked them as they put down loads of animals.

So, I am really sad, but happy at the same time knowing they will be happy with tons of Land and other cats, and will never be put down.

Gonna get as many pictures of them before they go, create an album and then post it in this subreddit.

I have also, between me and a couple of mates, created a subreddit dedicated to trying to find homes for pets, rather than be put down.

Its /r/RescuePetsUK and I would appreciate any help people can offer to spread the word.

I hate places that put down animals, just because no one wants them. So want to use the reddit community to help find homes for them.

I happened to get home as they got there, they asked if I lived near apartment 15, I said I was in 16. One asked if I'd seen my neighbour today and I replied to her that I hadn't, the other one asked if I had a balcony adjacent to my neighbour and I told him I did.

I said the balcony in my living room and bedroom was adjacent to his and they could come in and take a look to see if they could see anything next door so while they were on the living room balcony, I dashed upstairs to my room - switched the screen of my computer off which was displaying TOR and SR as I was replying to a message about an order of H I'm expecting tomorrow - and cleared my desk of the g of H, morphine tablet and half G of coke I had lying out because I was going to use later today.

I'm a young professional, and a pretty white girl who keeps a clean apartment. I was friendly to them both and they were friendly back, but man my heart when they came into my bedroom! I let them onto my balcony and glanced back into my room to make sure the box of needles I keep under my bed was out of sight, and to make sure there wasn't anything I'd missed just laying out in open view as shit tends to  do when you're panicking to clear stuff away.

I have nothing against cops, I feel safe around them and I don't typically have any reason not be, I've had nothing but good experiences with them. But wow, definitely felt anxious there for a minute.

(Nothing in neighbour's living room and his bedroom blinds were drawn. They then stood in the buildings' hallway banging on the neighbour's door and radioed information back to wherever. Guy eventually answered his door. He's a nice guy - I'm glad he turned out OK.

If I needed, I could cop at road. But I haven't. And until it's time, I won't. My question is based on the presumption that we consider ourselves to be 'us' while holding, and I wonder about the creatures we become post-WD. I know a lot of people turn from junk to drink, sometimes to coke in its ubiquity, or maybe invest their addictions in the acceptable;  2 packs and 6+ cups of coffee every day. All come loaded with identity, with personality, just like junk, and I am curious as to what you're like without what universally defines us.

For me, it's always the same. I'm no longer floating freely through streets, at home but removed from it all. I'm just another human being filling my days with the infinite ""somewhere to be"" so constantly that I don't have to deal with these quandaries. Though through my own decisions I have all but run out of ""somewhere to be"". I don't feel like I blend anymore, even though I probably stood out while sickly thin and tired. Now I'm just some creature, catching the eye of everyone I pass, judging every smile and every ounce of happiness in some sick misanthropic fit. I love good coffee when I'm clean. The coffee shops are hell-lands of bleach blonde and boring people, and of the invariable hipster parade, but good coffee is a reason to live. I fuck more when I'm clean. I hate every second of it but I like to cum. I can't take my friends clean. The junkies seem foolish and the sober seem infantile. I'll drink with them, but I'll drink much more and say far less and they'll look at me funny. I'll write but not often and never anything of substance, no pun intended, just an endless stream of drivel like this.

So what about you? Who are you when you're clean?",1376408143.0

He the, same guy who stole a ring off his dead grandmothers finger, then proceeded to tell me why I was wrong using verses from the bible, and told me to be careful because ""Demons will always try to get you away from god.""

Now, I have been clean (rarely use, and no IV) for the past year, I am an addict, and do not think myself better than anyone on heroin, I will forever feel the urge for that fuzzy blanket Harold gives. BUT, this seems to be in direct contrast to his religious views (catholic) and he says it is but a minor vice, as compared to the thirst for knowledge which is a never ending addiction. 

My questions: How do you feel about your use of heroin/pills from a religious stand point? Does it bear no weight on your mind? Have you ever thought about it? Last but not least, would your religious convictions be enough to make you get clean?

And to the atheists out there, how do you view it in terms of morality? I know it can make us do some fucked up shit.

My questions:


1.  Sometimes, I can eat 2 pills every 4-6 hours I'm awake, and I'm high off my tits from this amount, nodding, feeling great. But sometimes, I can take 4 at once (I haven't taken more than that at a time and am nervous to go > 60mg at once) and feel absolutely nothing.  Usually it'll be the entire Rx. ie if I'm going to get high, the whole scrip will get me high. If I get my refill, and don't get a buzz on the first several pills I eat, I probably won't off of any of the pills no matter how high of a dose I go to. I refill the scrips at the same pharmacy, so should be the exact same pills, just different days. Suggestions?? It sucks hard to waste an entire Rx. (I don't want to smoke or IV, and tried snorting but did not enjoy).  I guess I'm mostly just curious why this happens? Probably 1 of every 4 refills results in no high whatsoever. Booooooooo.  


2. Would it be possible to get WDs from this amount? Sometimes when the Rx is finished (it never lasts me more than 7 days, usually 3-5) I feel absolutely fine, but sometimes, I get aches, diarrhea, night sweats, hardcore fatigue, cold sweats during the day, etc. interestingly, it does not correspond to when I catch a buzz from the pills - for example, my last Rx I didn't get high at all, but have felt like shit today since I finished the Rx last night. 


What the hell is going on?  Anyone have any thoughts??

A bit of background: Prior to these 9 days, I havent had much of a habit, just the occasional bupe/oxy. So I've never had a heavy habit, this has been the peak of my use. I enjoy buprenorphine because of its long half-life, and it's stimulating yet euphoric and anxiolytic effects.

I'm a vocalist and guitar player looking to form an alternative rock band that will change the lives of those who listen to it. 

Circa Survive is one of my greatest influences, it has really shaped the person I am today. The reason I'm posting this is to meet fellow people who share the same dream with similar ideals. I've been a long time lurker and I'd like to finally get to know you fine people :)

And, in case you're wondering... Yes, I would.

He had these blues and packaged Actavis fent patches. So everything seemed legit. When i got home I noticed something just seemed off about these m boxes. This is my first time buying mboxes so I have no frame of reference. After doing some research the most glaring flaw with these is the imprints do not match on every pill. Sometimes the 30 is right side up with the  M other-times it is upside down. Anyone have any idea if these are fake? If they are they seem incredibly well done.  I'm leaning on the side of fake unfortunately.

""Man there is nothing better than new socks."" Said Chuck as he adjusted the vent of the heater.


""I can think of one thing."" I said.


""Do you think it's been long enough?"" Chuck asked, still stretching the new pair of socks over his feet.


""I fucking hope so.""


I slid the car into gear and began backing out of the parking space. The D-house had been out of commision all day. The cops had a whole posse in front of a different house for who knows what, but they had two blocks shut down so we couldn't score. We went to the park for a while, but it was the first really cold day of the year and we weren't ready for it. We ended up at Wally World roaming random aisles looking at kitchen appliances, video games, fucking yarn, anything to distract us from our increasingly runny noses and the first waves of chill running up our spines. Chuck bought the new socks he wouldn't shut the fuck up about, I bought two Dr. Peppers and a Butterfinger, and we both bought coats. We sat in the parking lot for another 45 minutes before we decided it was long enough.


Everything looked good when we got to the hood. We picked up 12 boy and 3 girl with ease and headed downtown. We had a spot just on the outskirts to park and get fixed up. We were proud of this spot. It was in a parking lot that not many people seemed to know about. There was a billboard in the parking lot, right against an old 5 story building that was used for storage now. The beams that held up this billboard were spaced just wide enough so a car could park, but if you pulled in just right the beams were so tight you couldn't open the doors. Our thinking was there was no way a cop could pull us out before we ate the stash even if they surprised us. Maybe the logic wasn't flawless, but we were proud regardless.


A few lines later, my head against the headrest as relief washed through me, Chuck broke the silence.


""Back up man."" he said urgently.


Shit cops, I thought and grabbed my caps, shoving them in my mouth.


""Nooo!"" yelled Chuck.


I looked at him, confused, then spit the caps into my lap and started frantically trying to dry them off.


""Back up man!"" Said Chuck again, but I was too busy with the task at hand. I heard the window roll down and Chuck kicked me, spilling my wet caps to the floor, as he scrambled out of the window. I looked 360, but saw nothing so I bent down to retrieve my stash. I got everything dried off and double checked, it was all good. When I finally looked up Chuck was at the window.


""What the fuck man?"" I asked him


""Just come on, let's go"" he said.


I backed up a bit, grabbed my shit and got out. I noticed Chuck was already at the edge of the parking lot and wasn't stopping. We were headed to play some pool. As I walked away from the car something caught my eye. Something bright white sticking out in the dying light of dusk. There behind one of the old air conditioning units that lined the side of the building behind the billboard was a hot steaming pile. On top of that pile, adorned with some freshly added brown stripes, was Chuck's new pair of socks. I looked at Chuck, still walking, not looking back. My breath puffed out in chuckled steam, like a train stack, as I hurried to catch up",1376576326.0

I've really enjoyed having a wee lurk about but thought I should get a bit more involved. 
I'm sure this question has been asked before but how did you first get into opiates and how did it progress for you? 
My first experience was codeine phosphate at about age 14 (give to me by my mum for backache).

Currently, I take tramadol fairly regularly due to my partner having a prescription for it. We found it was a nice change from weed (previous DOC) and we thoroughly enjoy taking it together and having a good old nod. I gotta say this sub is making me more than curious about other opes :p",1376521962.0

Several Ideas I have thought of include bringing someone else's MRI, faking nerve pain, putting blood in my urine, etc... I'd also be willing to photoshop a prescription for a short term score. I wanna hear some real ""Drugstore Cowboy"" kinda shit.

If you have any ideas post here and lets see what we can come up with! For those who know their way around doctors, or those who are prescribed legitimately, let me know.

1kfviq,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1kfviq/missed_shotsinflammationabscesses/,20,https://redd.it/1kfviq,srblows,Missed shots/Inflammation/Abscesses.,"So i'm just a lurker on the thread but enjoy the conversation from time to time.  I figured since there is a LOT of misinformation on the internet about a lot of things drug and injection related I would relay some advice.  Most of my information is personal experience working in an OR in a busy trauma hospital.  I don't personally shoot opiates, but I give them for a living I won't elaborate on that.  Take my advice however you would like, hopefully it will help.  I'm open to questions.  If you guys find it helpful maybe I can do another thread about Naloxone/Narcan another time.

First things first, i'm going to discuss an ideal injection technique and recommendations for not so ideal techniques.

#1 ALWAYS USE A NEW RIG/syringe every single time.  They are readily available on the internet, very cheap (1% of the price of your drugs for a huge supply) and safe to ship even to your home.  

#2  AT LEAST FILTER your gear, but ideally what you should do is use a multi-use vial.  You can buy sterile vials in many sizes all over the internet.  The other advantage is if you make your whole bag or more at one time you can use it whenever you want on the fly with no filtering/spoon/whatever.  So you start out with a clean technique, boil some water for a while or use bacteriostatic water (you can also buy on the internet).  If you are using your own water please buy benzyl alcohol (also on the internet).  You can make your own bacteriostatic water by adding 9 units of b.a. to ~10ml's of water/solution.  This will not only keep bacteria out of your solution for a long time but BA has also been proven in certain concentrations to be bactericidal (it will kill some bacteria already present in your solution).  You want to make this BA/gear/water solution in a clean container such as a shot glass wiped down with an alcohol wipe you are just using clean technique.  

After you make it you switch to sterile technique using a new syringe (such as a 10cc with a removable needle) remove the needle and draw up the solution, then place a sterile .22 or smaller syringe filter: https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSKjnTjvGqmit4BAUy3kj30CIHADZEg3KpT5YWgYkfQrdT7PS9R1g on the end of your syringe, put your sterile needle on it and inject the solution while filtering it into the sterile vial.  This method is MUCH cleaner, easier and safer for you than all alternatives.

If you can't do this, please at least wipe down a clean spoon with an alcohol wipe, use sterile cotton or rip off the end of a q-tip (with alcohol disinfected hands) and filter your shot through that.  

#3 WASH YOUR HANDS, clean your injection site.  Rotate injection sites as frequently as possible.  The single largest reason IV drug users get pulmonary embolisms is because scar tissue/granulation breaks off and goes to the heart.

#4 Just something to understand, many people say there is a correlation between BTH and flesh eating bacteria, BTH has been known to have it more than #4.  This is just something you should be aware of in case 

If you take these simple steps you'll dramatically decrease your chances of getting an actual infection if you miss a shot.  You will also dramatically decrease your chances of getting cotton fever and endocarditis.  With endocarditis you may already have it especially if your technique isn't clean, and you won't know until it gets very bad.  You can't ""feel"" the bacteria on your heart/valves/etc.  

Now if you do miss a shot, my advice is immediately place warm moist (even hot is fine as long as you don't burn yourself) towel/compress over the area and hold slight pressure.  Keep warming it up over and over if its a towel and hopefully within a day it will reabsorb.  

It is completely normal for the area to be red and painful the next day and sometimes even for up to a week.  This does not necessarily mean you have an infection.  There are also two types of abscesses (bumps essentially) so if you have a bump that won't go away it doesn't mean you have an infection.   You can also get a sterile abscess which in time will go away.

Redness at the site and pain simply means there is an inflammatory response and is part of your body dealing with the foreign substance, it is completely NORMAL.  If the inflammation is very bad or painful you can use ibuprofen in doses 800mg+ to decrease inflammation.  

Watch the site if it gets very bad quickly, like redness is spreading very fast or the site is getting warm or you are getting a generalized fever then you most likely have an infection.  If none of this stuff is happening then you are most likely OK to wait it out.

Antibiotics or seeing a doctor are both fine, broad spectrum stuff effective against MRSA such as bactrim will ease your mind a bit even if you don't have an infection.   However do NOT let anyone lance/cut open your wound, including primary care physicians unless you have a surgical consult and at least a WBC count to prove infection.  If it is not done correctly it can cause an even worse infection that might cost you the limb.  Most clinic docs, nurses etc won't even try this because they know if they fuck up you'll sue them but if someone cuts you open to drain it make sure its a surgeon.  Just get antibiotics from the clinic docs.

I'm also open to questions if you guys have any.",1376597406.0

When u could still get hydro online with a short questionnaire. I got #90 10/325 for $180, delivered to my dorm. The FedEx guy gave me a raised eyebrow and asked how old I was. 

Was taking them four or five at a time, getting nice and high. I had been dabbling for about five years, and at the time I had zero tolerance. 

One morning I decided to take 80mg and go fuck around online in the lab. Took 8 tens, took a shower, got a great rush while getting ready and went to the lab. 
That's when I started nodding hard, harder than I've ever nodded without a benzo. I simply couldnt stay awake. The lab monitor guy came and woke me up about three times. The third time he asked if I was ok and did I need him to call someone? I said no and he informed me that if he had to wake me up again he was going to call campus popo. 

Stupidly I thought I'd be fine and Able to stay awake. Next thing I know I wake up to an officer standing over me aaking me to step into the hallway.
I did, and he proceeded to ask me what I took. I told him I took hydro, prescribed, for migraines. I told him I was just tired and needed to go lay down and he said sorry I can't just let u go bc if something were to happen blah blah blah.
At that point he had been holding me there  and talking with me for about 30minutes and didn't seem like he was planning on letting me walk. 
So I asked him if I was under arrest and if not, I'd like to go take a nap.
Oh well u may not wake up from your nap- he says. And I can't have that on.my watch or something similar.
So what r u saying, I ask him. 
He tells me I can either go to the hospital, for a possible overdose, or he can arrest me for public intoxication. 
In hindsight, I should have taken door #2 but i chose the hospital. Stupid. 

They can't just take me in their squad car, has to be an ambulance. I was really high, and I'm nodding in the ambulance. Stay with me, the emt kept saying. And every time a good nod started, it was rudely interrupted. 

Got to the hospital, they want a urine sample. I asked why because I already told u what I'm on. Oh we just want to be sure. Whatever. So I'm really high still and can't pee for the life of me. They threaten me with a catheter if I can't produce. This literally scared the Piss outta me. I got a few drips in the bottle finally. 

Then they wheel me out of my room and down a few hallways. I'm much more alert and coherent enough to ask where we r going. The nurse tells me I'm getting some brain scan because they're worried I have a brain tumor due to me nodding. 
I finally was fed up and I said listen I know why I was falling asleep its NOT A TUMA, AND I'd like to leave now and forgo the brain scan and any more exorbitant charges I may incur. 

They did release me after that but not before I got a lecture about drugs. My urine had all kinds of drugs in it - coke, speed (adderrall) pot, benzos. 

Not to mention that the first person I always call when I'm in a bind- my mom- was picking me up and got a DUI on the way so I had to call a friend and he is very anti everything but weed. He didn't say much, but he didn't have to.

Ambulance ride - $800
Hospital bill - $1100

I really love reading this sub-reddit. I read about other's experiences, and I feel that this community genuinely cares about one another.

This is more like a stream of consciousness type of thing as opposed to an actual, structured post. It just feels good to write this all out. 

I happened to get my hands on some Hydrocodones (5/500s) a couple of months ago due to some minor oral surgery. All I can say is that these things are a god send to me.

I am someone who is socially awkward and gets anxious in public environments. Going on dates, going with some friends to a bar, or going to crowded meetups / social events...I can't handle it. Normally, I am simply too overwhelmed to function. I am utterly self-conscious. I think about every action I take, or each word I produce and wonder how it affects other's perceptions of me. I am too inside of myself to engage with anyone or get into any sort of flow. I feel like an outsider that doesn't belong anywhere. 

And then I decided to take one pill 10 minutes prior to each of the above events. Suddenly I am completely relaxed. The crippling nervousness is gone. I am not worried about how others are perceiving me because I am too happy and don't give a damn. Conversation, which comes out of me in robotic, jagged spurts, suddenly flows smoothly. I no longer place my foot in my mouth. My level of confidence becomes sky high and I don't have a care in the world. I no longer have to force a smile upon my face, and rather than being involuntarily focused inwards, I am voluntarily focusing on the others around me, engaged in conversation, able to truly listen to others and immerse myself in whatever environment I am in.

I am a completely different person. In a social venue, things could go horribly wrong, and I wouldn't care. I could walk into a meeting knowing someone would violently berate me for the next hour, and it would all slide off like water. Because I am so relaxed, I can think and react as swiftly as I do when I am working in an isolated fashion. If I'm in a terrible mood, or had a long week, I can pop one of these babies, sit back, play some music (electronica or something instrumental preferred), close my eyes, and all my worries are gone within 30 minutes.

Unfortunately, I am paranoid about developing tolerance, paranoid about damaging my liver, paranoid about ruining my health, and paranoid about becoming an addict. Based on the last 2 paragraphs I just wrote, I'm probably fucked on the last part though. =) I reserve popping these pills for special social occasions, or the night before an off-day from the Gym. That puts me at around 2 pills a week. I guess I am lucky that one pill gives me that slight buzz needed to function normally in social settings.

Some random, random questions:

1) Is this what opiates feel like for you guys? Or am I overstating things? Maybe a large part of it is placebo effect / psychological...

2) The notion that pain killers can be used to address depression or anxiety sounds absolutely ludicrous. But so far it is working wonders for me. I would never go to a doctor and make such a request, but I am curious if sometime in the past somebody conducted research on this.

3) When I had my wisdom teeth removed, I had a liquid form of hydrocodone+apap. That was a LOT more potent and the effects were almost immediate. I would go from wanting to bash my skull in due to the pain to being content to lie on the couch and watch Netflix all day. I would also get dizzy and have trouble urinating, but I had such a warm fuzzy feeling in my stomach that I didn't care. The pills are nothing like that, but I suppose its a good thing, because on the dark red liquid, I was completely non-functional.

4) If I ever wanted to move up on dosage...well I'm scared for my liver. I don't think I will ever snort or shoot this stuff, so what are your favorite pills to ingest? Which pill gives the most ""bang"" for the buck?

5) I hope you guys are all having a great Friday night. Any music to recommend?",1376722669.0

It's my sixth one, hopefully my last, and a birthday gift to myself I suppose. 23 next week. Spent 22 in jail and 21 in sober living, now this, lol.










I decided to go on my own again because its time for me to quit this bullshit. I love smack, but I hate what it does to my life. Living in a bubble consisting of me, my dealer, and a couple using buddies on occasion is getting old. I miss having a social life and feeling like a responsible adult. Honestly, I haven't even had a job in 5 months. I've just been hustling and banging dope and not getting shit done with my life.









Not saying I'll never touch a needle again, but I can do my best to avoid it. I remember how good it felt to be sober. I was truly happy. I never laughed with such heartfelt joy. It sounds stupid, but that's the only way I can describe it. I thoroughly enjoy being sober but inevitably end up with a needle in my arm. This time I'm going to do right for myself and really give it an honest shot.











It is a 28-day facility that I'll be attending to the tune of 28k. Yeesh thank God I finally got insurance. It looks pretty nice. 12 step. Medical detox. My last 3 rehabs were county funded heaps. The residents in the inpatient program, oh hey that's me get a membership to Planet Fitness and go to the gym 5 days a week. Getting in shape and being healthy again is another personal goal of mine. I can't wait to work out and get an actual 3 squares a day lol I tone up incredibly fast.








I will definitely be around the recovery board and will be hangin here til it's my time to get outta the game. I've got a man that cares and supports me, and a loving family that does too. I also have ambition and determination on my side. It's time to get my life started. I love you guys, you're the best sub EVER and don't you forget! Stay high my friends!

I feel like I'm getting worse but I don't want to give up my Oxycodone.,"So I've been really trying hard not to completely eat my prescriptions in the first couple days of getting it.  I was getting 120 Oxycodone/APAP 5/325mg and 120 Tramadol 50mg.  I would go through both of them withing about 6 or 7 days and then I would call the pharmacy and get my Tramadol refilled early (because it's not a narcotic, it's up to the discretion of the pharmcy) to keep from withdrawing and the refill would be gone in about 5 more days.  And stupid me, for whatever reason, the Tramadol withdraws are much worse than the Oxycodone.

So anyway, I've been trying to figure out a way to keep it lasting more than a week.  Well, last month I got my Oxycodone to last me up until the very last week to which I ran out.  Luckily my doctor wrote the script for 5 days earlier than he should have so I was able to get it early.  So I filled the 120 Oxycodone/APAP 5/325mg and 120 Tramadol 50mg on a Saturday.   I saw my doctor that following Tuesday and to my surprise, he upped my dosage to 120 Oxycodone 10/325mg (he originally told me he was going to up it to 7.5mg but then decided to go all the way to 10 and said if it was too much to cut them in half).  I didn't even ask for the dosage increase so I felt like I just hit the lottery.  I was trying not to smile.  Not to mention I had JUST filled the other 5mg script several days before.

So this means on that Tuesday, I had 120 Oxycodone/APAP 5/325mg, 120 Oxycodone/APAP 10/325mg, and 120 Tramadol 50mg.  It's been almost two weeks and because I had so much, I haven't been paying attention to what I've been taking but I can tell you that I can't get any of the Oxycodone refilled until the 9th of September and most of it is gone.  I just checked and realized that I have 10 Tramadol left, all the Oxycodone 5/325mg are gone and less than half of the Oxycodone 10/325 are left.

I just want to say that I am (usually) a fairly intelligent person with a lot of patience and I usually have a ton of self-control and am able to wait for things when I need to.  For whatever reason, I can't control myself when it comes to opiates.

Now for my question.  Does anyone else have this problem?  

Second question.  How do I deal the rest of my Oxy out so that I don't get dope sick for the rest of the month?  Is it possible with the amount I've been taking lately?

The first night I took it I was passed out right away with all my clothes on. I have been taking the zopiclone and valium pretty much all day every day though to go with my suboxone.

now I wil try and wash it down with some  [IMG]http://i.imgur.com/eXIkVtx.jpg[/IMG]

Hopefully that helps!!

What do you find to be the best way to get high with suboxone>",1376781099.0

1kkoz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1kkoz7/i_love_ropiates/,11,https://redd.it/1kkoz7,loosefer,I Love R/Opiates.,"I really do. It sounds like quite the bold statement but like everything in life from the minute to the massive this sub has changed my life.

 I Have been here with many different user names. I probably would have only needed one but I keep forgetting my passcode and/or username haha. Regardless of that the experiences I have had here are invaluable. 
I never would have thought when I first found this sub through R/OpiatesRecovery that I would have found such a beautiful community of people here in this sub,
I have given advice I was happy I gave; Read advice that helped me, learned and pondered, laughed and cried.

On occasion If a username I see often catches my eye, I have even begin to create characterizations of who they are and what they look like in my mind ( I am not a psycho nor a stalker but a Film Maker so creative thinking comes natural to me.... I love to create characters from scratch).

This group here is amazing. I am really hsppy with the awesome gudies to cold turkey safely and the out reach I have seen from members when anither is in need. I am from Canada where harm reduction supplies and info is easy to come by so I am glad there is a lot of harm reduction info available here for users.

 If your down in the pits and looking for a friend there is no better place than here. You'll find an nonjudgmental person waiting to help you out. So many junkies seem wise beyond their years. I was having a rough moment the other day and within minutes an awesome guy from this sub was cheering me uo with some great convo on Skype just helping with no vested interested or something to gain. 


Harm reduction techniques are shared and spread so that more people understand the truth of what they are doing and dispell the myths.
That is somwthing we must never forget. 

There is a certain je nes se quois about the attitudes of the users on this sub. The way the conduct themselves it's unlike anything I have seen other than a few cities that are far from the norm
People here really want to help, and whats almost as important they don't want or need accolades for their help of to help drive them to continue.

They help because they know some one else needs it.

This sub may be full of ""pill porn"" and redundant questions abet ""CWE on four perc 10s"" which really is not what this forum is about.


It's about the sense of community and the strength in numbers that we offer those who need it.


I coul imagine being a young addict with very conservative parents, who might be on the verge of suicicde thinkig there is something wrong with him. Imagine the weight off his shoulders when he found this sub?
""wow there are people just like me! and you know what? they're good people too! creative, cool, compassionate. Certainly not the skinny junkie with festering wounds you imagine 
trying to get school kids hooked on his project.

This sub is an absolute wealth of knowledge on all aspects of opiates. Also it can be looked at as a view point into a small part of the human condition.
This sub is INVALUABLE.


I haven't proof read this rant. This was totally stream if consciousness. Maybe one day I will work on improving it.

But for now this goes out as a BIG THANK YOU to the Community and MODS that make this such a special place.

Yeah I have weed, xanax, gabapentin but all that isn't really even close to what I want. Anyway so I normally am a pretty mellow person but it seems like ppl are intentionally trying to make me have to knock the shit out of them. Now I know my quick temper is because I feel like shit right now but damn its making me wonder if some of these folks aren't always bitches and I just haven't noticed cause I was high and honestly just didn't give a fuck. All i wanted was some coffee this morning and of course I don't have all the crap needed to make coffee so i gotta get dressed and go to town. Finally showered and dressed and head to the store, run in grab my milk and dunkin donuts coffee go to check out and the cashier is some random bitch that I don't know. Apparently I do know her, she's married to one of my cousins, btw I have a very large family and we all fight like we belong on Springer so eventually we just quit seeing each other. So anyway this random ass bitch informs me she is married to my cousin and after her shift she's gotta go to my dads with my cousin to do yard work. The whole time she's giving me this bitchy ass look, then has the balls to bring up how my big brother use to do all that before he died and how she would have thought I would have started spending time with my dad after my brother was gone. Now I was still trying to keep my cool even with this bitch raising her voice to me and making a scene in front of all these customers. So i went to just leave I mean fuck it I feel bad enough without having to catch a case for beating this ignorant bitch down but then she followed me. Really so now I just about lose it and get in her face, how some stupid ass bitch can tell me about what My brother would have wanted and how bad my dad feels for being a piece of shit his whole life. So I end up telling her to go fuck herself and how I really could care less about an old fuck up trying to make shit right so he can get into heaven, that as far as I gave a shit she could burn in hell with him. Then I couldn't hold back no more and punched the bitch in her big ass mouth and walked nicely to my car and left. I am now sitting here drinking my coffee waiting to see if she or her job called the damn cops on me.

 Being lazy and not wanting to expend all the effort. Not today. 
First try was on inner forearm cuz I have visible veins there. Didn't register, pulled out. Now is the time when I usually get real nervous and my hands get unsteady. sometimes so shaky that I couldn't push on, so to speak.  Fuck that, not up in here! 


Decided to try the crook, even tho the veins are less visible, I can kinda see em. Got in, pulled back to make a vacuum, pushed forward and pop, I registered! Here's where I literally got hard. Raging semi within 3 seconds. Not joking. It's been a lot of tries and misses and half registers( going right thru vein) to get here. Hope I can just get better at it now. 

There r definitely two separate punctures that are felt in my case. Skin, vein. 
The rush was similar to when I used to snort an entire 40mg stop sign opana.

So I posted this stuff I wrote a while ago, but thought I should post it again considering that this sub has gotten much MUCH bigger, therefore I can reach a bigger audience. So while getting into opiates I was researching the best way to shoot pills (MSContin was my first hook up). Came across research into wheel filters by an Australian researcher, and actually ended up attending one of his presentations as a rep for a needle exchange at a forum for those kind of organisations. 


So the first link is a little taste, basically show how good wheel filters are at filtering a solution, showing how they remove almost all particles and are actually the most effective filter when it comes to letting all the drugs through. With pictures:

http://forum.opiophile.org/showthread.php?33744-How-do-you-filter-your-MSContin


The second link contains more detailed information. It's another post I wrote (I've posted them on 420chan/bluelight/opiophile as well). It has more pictures and graphs. Shows how good wheel filters are at what they do, why you should buy them, and also talks a bit about the adverse health effects of not using them. They are worth the investment, but luckily we get them for free in Australia.

http://www.health.gov.au/internet/drugstrategy/publishing.nsf/Content/ndssubs-010/$FILE/010_S%20McLean%20R%20Bruno_05-02-2010.doc

That link is is submitted report on wheel filters and why they are good tools for harm reduction. It also talks about the health effects of particles being injected from pills, and basically, it's some bad shit you should read if you shoot pills. 


This link is a PDF file he gave me a copy of, it was the presentation he gave at the forum I attended for the injecting centre in sydney, needle exchanges, methadone clinics and other related places:

It seems it can vary and you don't necessarily need to increase sub dose with tolerance, it's a bit confusing. so can anyone with experience with sub explain it? I would be getting 2mg suboxone tablets. And if I was maintaining on an opiate, I would want it to be about the equiv to 100mg of morphine IV.

I have a daily habit which consists of about 50mg of H OR 100mg Morphine IV to get a nice rush and an average high. And 100mg of H and 200mg of Morphine IV to get a good high/nod. The 50mg of H is stronger then 100mg of morphine IV, probably about 150mg of morphine IV, and yes the morphine I'm using I definitley am getting 100% of the pills. This is Australia, usually H is sold in 0.1g packets or 0.25g quarters. But my dealer doesn't do hers by weight, just by dose/potency, since her 75mg packets (with the aluminium) are stronger than any point of H I get on the street. And it's stronger than the SR dope I've tried (150mg of hers was equiv to 250mg of SR dope). Oxycodone equiv for a good high would be 120mg for decent/average shot and 240mg for a very good nod I reckon. 

Morphine/H/Oxy are 50c a mg. In case any of you were interested in prices for Australia (Sydney), those are original oxys as well. Methadone/fent/sub are available. I've gotten a 25mcg/hr fent patch for $75 (seemed pretty expensive) it is the sticky plastic ones though we don't get the gel ones. Considering it was equiv to 420mg of Morphine it's not that bad, if only I knew how to extract it effectively at the time. Xanax is $4 for 2mg (less if you buy bulk). Oxy/hydromorphone are unavailable, hydromorphone is available I guess, but very rare to get (only used in hospital situations). Hydrocodone doesn't exist either.",1376937920.0

It mixed up clear. Shot them together, the rush was strange and new but nice as fuck, the meth was obviously more powerful then the H though cuz it was more stim rush, I was still getting a H rush though, it seemed to last longer then a normal rush. I've shot 50mg of H twice a few hours since that. But the whole time (12 hours now) the meth has been the dominant factor (I haven't really nodded but haven't feel racey or anything either). I've snorted oxy + dexamphetamine before. But this was quite good, the only thing I would do next time is put more opiates in the single shot to get a better more even rush.

“how do you know all these things about me?” 
Your skin is translucent from the ashing and the scratching all night. You rub your tattoos as if they will bring you luck.  You can barely hold a thought together as you drift off into the absence of burdens. 
“why should I believe you. No one even means what they say.”
you light a cigarette to keep yourself propped up into our conversation. Slowly I lean in. 
“I’m not sure what it is.” 
I say this but I know it is not the truth. I do know. You are exactly what I wanted in life. All the pain you wear illuminated in scars make me see beneath the chemical facade you show to the world. As your breath slows, I hear your heartbeat beneath the ribs that poke at my nose. There is some type of connection that drives me to awareness of the futility of our situation. Your eyes are glassy and pinned. Your lips are dry. Your hands are swollen from the circulation that can not quite navigate your punctures. You see me as a witness. I see myself as a participant in the drama that will ensue. You are my fantasy. Exactly what I wanted was you.

As some of you may or may not know, I recently moved to the other side of the country with 1 connect about an hour and a half away. Legit source, for sure, but the drive can be a pain (especially when sick!). So after making a trip today, I was good 'n high and kinda bored, but feeling confident about scopin' out the ""rough"" areas of town. I realized going into this that this probably wasn't the brightest idea because it was after dark. But I'm an idiot addict. So I cruise to a shady part of town to a 7-11 with alot of foot traffic. Chill, check out redbox, smoke a cig, share my lighter with a few people. Finally one dude offers some ""bomb smoke."" I'm like ""nah but you know where to get that boy?"" He says yeah, 10 buck a cap. I'm not familiar with this lingo but say I'll take four. He asks for the cash, I ask to see the product. He chuckles and tells me it's not there, he's gotta run around the corner and get it. It's obvious from the other people hanging out that he's the supplier for their habits. Obvious red flag raises, he senses my suspicion and says ""I ain't gonna do you like that"" so I cave and give him my cash. Of course, bad idea, cause he never comes back. $40 lost, charge it to the game. Some dude pulls up, asks for a light. I just straight up blurt out what happened and he laughs, asks what I was trying to get. He says he'll call his boy. His dude doesn't have any H but has the white lady. I'm like sure, cause I'm just trying to make a decent connect in the area. So I follow the dude to his dude, who's waiting in the parking lot, ready to go. Even after just getting ripped off, I immediately get good vibes with this guy, ""Red."" I tell him what happened and he also laughs saying ""Yeah man I don't play any funny business, I'll check on some D tomorrow and let you know."" We exchange numbers. I taste the ""cap"" and it's for sure coke, so I shoot the rest of it, catch a rush and puke in my handy plastic sack I keep in the car for just such occasions. Text Red saying it's good shit, I'm a loyal customer, never ask for fronts, smooth transactions all the way, etc. etc. He responds with a ""glad you like it, I'll holler at ya tomorrow about the D."" Sorry for the wall of text but just had to share the experience and let those know who are struggling that it's still possible to meet good guy dealers through old fashioned networking!

There I was at a women's health office at a university known for its teaching hospital. I put on my tough face, yet the tech who came to get me for an ultrasound got very empathetic and asked, ""Oh my gosh, are you in a lot of pain? I am so sorry this is taking so long!"" My reply was, ""Well, I'm in pain all the time, this is kind of normal for me"" to which she replied, ""Oh no! That's terrible! I'll be as gentle as possible, if I hurt you *please* tell me!"" That's the first time I've ever had a tech give a damn about my pain levels, it cheered me up a bit.

So the gyno I get has a very heavy Russian accent and is older than dirt. I'm there for severe endometriosis and lower abdominal pain that spreads into my hips and thighs. After having the ultrasound and three different sets of fingers rooting around in my cooter, I'm told that not only do I have an endometrial cyst on an ovary the size of a golf ball (which will require surgery in the next month or so), the other ovary they can see an endo adhesion making it adhere to the uterus, and the pelvic floor muscles are spasming constantly causing at least some of the pain I'm in. 

So, common sense would be to ask for pain killers, all things considered. Her reply? Oh no, if you take the narcotics you only become more sensitive to the pain."" Fine, as usual I'm left to suffer, curled in a ball with the heating pad on the couch when I get home, business as usual. I'm in no mood to fight for 'em. When I get up to leave at the end of the visit, she hands me a couple 'scripts. One is for Lidocaine 5% for any pain in the outer inch or two of the vagina. The other 'script is for, of all things, 5mg of Valium, 60 with 2 refills. A little shocked, I ask what in the hell they're for. Her reply? My vagina. Oooooooookay....so...you want me to take them and they're going to magically help my pain down there? Oh no, you don't take one, you put one in your vagina. Wait, what? Yes, you put one in your vagina, they are wonderful muscle relaxers! Trust me on this! Won't that affect me systemically? Oh no, it all stays in your lower abdomen, start with one pill and if that doesn't help move to two! 

I'm not one to refuse Valium, so I take it to the pharmacy thinking maybe she wrote it for a vaginal suppository. I get the bottle and nope, not a suppository. Actual pills. The pharmacist says it's very rare to see such a 'script, that there are only 2 hospitals that he knew of that did it (one being Mayo). He also confirmed what I was thinking, I will definitely be affected systemically due to the vasculature down there. We joked around about it a bit, and I concluded that my cooter has a severe anxiety disorder and requires heavy duty benzos for it.

Figured I'd share it with you all, it's called 'Embraced by the Needle' by Dr. Gabor Mate. He's just great.. has a good book about addiction as well called 'In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction', I highly recommend reading it!!! (I listened to the audio book) 






>
Addictions always originate in unhappiness, even if hidden.

>They are emotional anesthetics; they numb pain.  The first question — always — is not “Why the addiction?” but “Why the pain?” The answer, ever the same, is scrawled with crude eloquence on the wall of my patient Anna’s room at the Portland Hotel in the heart of Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside: “Any place I went to, I wasn’t wanted. And that bites large.”

>The Downtown Eastside is considered to be Canada’s drug capital, with an addict population of 3,000 to 5,000 individuals.  I am staff physician at the Portland, a non-profit, harm-reduction facility where most of the clients are addicted to cocaine, to alcohol, to opiates like heroin, or to tranquilizers — or to any combination of these things.

>Many also suffer from mental illness.

>Like Anna, a 32-year-old poet, many are HIV positive or have full-blown AIDS.  The methadone I prescribe for their opiate dependence does little for the emotional anguish compressed in every heartbeat of these driven souls.

>Methadone staves off the torment of opiate withdrawal, but, unlike heroin, it does not create a “high” for regular users.

>The essence of that high was best expressed by a 27-year-old sex-trade worker.  “The first time I did heroin,” she said, “it felt like a warm, soft hug.” In a phrase, she summed up the psychological and chemical cravings that make some people vulnerable to substance dependence.

>**No drug is, in itself, addictive**.

>Only about 8 per cent to 15 per cent of people who try, say alcohol or marijuana, go on to addictive use.  What makes them vulnerable? Neither physiological predispositions nor individual moral failures explain drug addictions.  Chemical and emotional vulnerability are the products of life experience, according to current brain research and developmental psychology.

>Most human-brain growth occurs following birth; physical and emotional interactions determine much of our brain development.  Each brain’s circuitry and chemistry reflects individual life experiences as much as inherited tendencies.

>For any drug to work in the brain, the nerve cells have to have receptors – — sites where the drug can bind.  We have opiate receptors because our brain has natural opiate-like substances, called endorphins, chemicals that participate in many functions, including the regulation of pain and mood.  Similarly, tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine class, such as Valium, exert their effect at the brain’s natural benzodiazepine receptors.

>Infant rats who get less grooming from their mothers have fewer natural benzo receptors in the part of the brain that controls anxiety.

>Brains of infant monkeys separated from their mothers for only a few days are measurably deficient in the key neurochemical, dopamine.

>It is the same with human beings.

>Endorphins are released in the infant’s brain when there are warm, non-stressed, calm interactions with the parenting figures.

>Endorphins, in turn, promote the growth of receptors and nerve cells, and the discharge of other important brain chemicals.  The fewer endorphin-enhancing experiences in infancy and early childhood, the greater the need for external sources.

>Hence, the greater vulnerability to addictions.

>Distinguishing skid row addicts is the extreme degree of stress they had to endure early in life.  Almost all women now inhabiting Canada’s addiction capital suffered sexual assaults in childhood, as did many of the males.

>Childhood memories of serial abandonment or severe physical and psychological abuse are common.  The histories of my Portland patients tell of pain upon pain.

>Carl, a 36-year-old native, was banished from one foster home after another, had dishwashing liquid poured down his throat for using foul language at age 5, and was tied to a chair in a dark room to control his hyperactivity.  When angry at himself — as he was recently, for using cocaine — he gouges his foot with a knife as punishment.  His facial expression was that of a terrorized urchin who had just broken some family law and feared draconian retribution.  I reassured him I wasn’t his foster parent, and that he didn’t owe it to me not to screw up.

>But what of families where there was not abuse, but love, where parents did their best to provide their children with a secure, nurturing home? One also sees addictions arising in such families.  The unseen factor here is the stress the parents themselves lived under, even if they did not recognize it.  That stress could come from relationship problems, or from outside circumstances such as economic pressure or political disruption.  The most frequent source of hidden stress is the parents’ own childhood histories that saddled them with emotional baggage they had never become conscious of.  What we are not aware of in ourselves, we pass on to our children.

>Stressed, anxious, or depressed parents have great difficulty initiating enough of those emotionally rewarding, endorphin-liberating interactions with their children.

>**Later in life such children may experience a hit of heroin as the “warm, soft hug” my patient described: What they didn’t get enough of before, they can now inject.**

>Feeling alone, feeling there has never been anyone with whom to share their deepest emotions, is universal among drug addicts.

>That is what Anna had lamented on her wall.  No matter how much love a parent has, the child does not experience being wanted unless he or she is made absolutely safe to express exactly how unhappy, or angry, or hate-filled he or she may at times feel.  The sense of unconditional love, of being fully accepted even when most ornery, is what no addict ever experienced in childhood — often not because the parents did not have it to give, simply because they did not know how to transmit it to the child.

>Addicts rarely make the connection between troubled childhood experiences and self-harming habits.

>They blame themselves — and that is the greatest wound of all, being cut off from their natural self-compassion.  “I was hit a lot,” 40-year-old Wayne says, “but I asked for it.  Then I made some stupid decisions.” And would he hit a child, no matter how much that child “asked for it”? Would he blame that child for “stupid decisions”?

>Wayne looks away.  “I don’t want to talk about that crap,” says this tough man, who has worked on oil rigs and construction sites and served 15 years in jail for robbery.

>He looks away and wipes tears from his eyes.",1377148517.0

I had to pay $250 dollars upfront to see him and he only prescribed me 15 8mg strips because I was honest and told him I had been buying Suboxone from a friend to start a maintenance program because I was sick of being broke and dope sick all the time. Now I have a job that I have kept for over 2 months now (and intend to keep until I can find something better) and he wants to send me to rehab! I am doing better than I have in years and he wants to take that away from me. I just want to find a compassionate doctor who wants to work with me, not against me! 

Why can't I have a Suboxone prescription if I need one?! Why can't I smoke weed and take my prescribed Klonopin? Maybe this is too much like having my cake and eating it too, but I'm sorry I am an addict and want to use drugs?! He didn't try to make me sign a contract or anything. All he did was take a urine test (I failed for heroin, cocaine, benzodiazepines and marijuana) and he said he would only give me 15 x 8mg strips. This next test I should only fail for marijuana because I am staying clean. Do you think he'll change his mind on the next visit? 

Because he did agree to see me again but he said he wanted me to either do inpatient rehab or intensive outpatient but there's no way I can do more than weekly one-on-one therapy and monthly psychiatric visits. I already feel like I go to the doctor way too much as it is! Also, I can't afford it because I am going to be losing my health insurance soon. 

All of this because I can't/don't want to stop using heroin! I just *need* to keep getting high and it's pissing me off because there is so much more I could be doing than working a shitty retail job, get high once a week, take my Suboxone as little as possible (just enough to be able to work) and not smoke or do coke or have to withdraw from benzodiazepines at the same time! There's absolutely no way I can work with the public without Klonopin.

My wife knows I take the pain killers but has no idea that I had taken opiates recreationally.  

Anyway, I gave her the whole of my Oxy stash and told her I wanted to make sure I wasn't taking more than I needed.  She would set out my bottle with a weeks worth of Oxy.  Not only could I not due more than my weekly allotted amount, she was able to see how much I was taking by glancing at the bottle.  So I would just tell her I was taking them every six hours and then when enough time had passed that 3 or 4 or 5 were supposed to be gone, I would grab them and eat all 3 or 4 or 5 at once.  This worked.  It was literally the first time I had a script last, not only longer than the second week, but until the very end of the month.

This month, we did the same thing.  The problem is that she handed me the bags of Oxy for the other 3 weeks and told me I could put them up.  Big problem for obvious reasons.  I filled them both the Tramadol and the Oxycodone on the 9th and I only have 5 Oxys left and all the Tramadol is gone.  I just got off the phone with the pharmacy and they are going to refill my Tramadol prescription super early (thankfully Tramadol is not a narcotic so it's not super-controlled).  But I still get high off of Tramadol so I should be good for a while but I think I'll ask my wife to hide the Oxy when I refill next month.

My brain works in this way that the more drugs I have, the more I take.  I use to be content with one Lortab (Hydrocodone) 10/325 a day.  I took 12 or 13 Oxycodones 10/325 last night.  Last month I made the script last until the end of the month while this month, I actually had two full Oxycodone scripts (one was 5/325 and the other was 10/325, both 120 in quantity) and I couldn't make them last two weeks.

Oh well.  Good nod to all and to all a good nod.

tl;dr - Have a trusted family member or SO give you a day or weeks worth (if you get a script, I'm sure heroin might not be as acceptable to family members or non-using SO) at a time so you can't do more than the allotted amount in the allotted time.

Ok, for reference, I've been in the game for about five years. Hydros>Percs>OC>Opana>Heroin>IV Heroin just like everyone else. I was going to a respectable university before taking a break and working. The last few months have been increasingly hectic since I quit my job but I haven't had much downtime - I'm just not really the type to sit it out and stay sick. 

One of my closest friends and using partner/crimey/whatev has been waiting to catch his time for some heroin sales (fucking informants) and both of us have been using the phrase ""FUCK IT"" with increasing frequency. ""Propelling ourselves with longing towards the day it would all go wrong."" In the back of my mind, I've been thinking I'd just ride hard until he left and then chill out.

Among a litany of scams, hustles, and schemes that have kept us healthy in the last month, I had the fabulous idea of stealing from my uncle's business when I knew there was only one person working. My partner distracted the guy by asking for a jump while I ran in with a towel on my head and sunglasses - emptied the register down to the coin rolls. Within an hour he had seen the tapes and was blowing my phone up. He physically confronted me (which I certainly deserved) and told me either go to rehab (on his dime) or he talks to detectives. Naturally I made arrangements to check in soon.

Not surprisingly, rather than scare me straight, I felt even more reckless. So my buddy and I have solid connects who trust us and the next hustle was him shorting his people big time. The first two went smooth and they didn't notice until well after. The third guy though - I guess he was suspicious of how my friend sprinted back to the car. I'm driving this third kid's European Sports Car in traffic and hear a horn - there's a minivan on my ass with a very pissed black man inside. I pretended to pull over then whipped a u-turn with about 100yds in front of an ambulance (siren/lights on) and this crazy fucker does the same. That van must have some after market parts because I was putting the pedal to the floor in a European Sports Car and could not shake him. Finally I get into this confusing neighborhood of very nice homes and start taking random turns - beginning to think all is cool. Then dude came out of nowhere, blew a stopsign, and tried to block the road but I took a yard detour on him. It was also super wet on the road with light rain and the next turn I took high speed and the European Sports Car performed like a champ - no slide whatsoever but it was making a bunch of crazy beeps. Dude tried to mimic that turn in his van and the last thing I saw in the rearview was him scraping a tree. I was out - quickly got to the safety of the burbs and got noddy.

Next day, the European Sports Car kid sold his dirtbike and we head out to a rural area where lots of dealers live (city during the day for hustling, country at night) to cop a bunch. Shit was cool, got the dope from my guy (didn't burn any of my people) and roll out. I guess I was speeding because I saw blue lights in the rearview coming quick. Again I'm driving the European Sports Car because I'm in the best shape - I turned to its owner and told him I wasn't stopping until the dope was safely gone to which he replies ""LET ME THE FUCK OUT"" so I cut a turn and he goes running into the woods. We were on a state road and they would have found at least some of the hundred bags so I'm looking for a creek or something. Ready To Die is playing; my buddy turns up ""Things Done Changed"" and I get on my rally racer shit. The chase had been on for maybe two minutes when I get to a familiar area near water and start making it rain stamp bags. I was worrying about more cops so I hit I dirt road I know and ditch it after grabbing a shopping bag with my phone in it. We go separate ways and I hear the cop's voice yelling into his radio in my friends direction. Recently quit smoking and my stamina was unbelievable - I got to this creek and wade in with my phone held above my head. On the other bank I walked parallel for a while and ended up hiding under a bridge until dawn when I made my way to a gas station and called a cab. Got the driver to take me to my mom and step dad's house where I begged him to pay the fare. I was dirty and my clothes were torn to shit but fortunately he didn't ask any questions. Walked to my apartment from there and just shot up three bags I kept that were damp with filthy creek water. Never had a better shot in my life.

Haven't confirmed yet but I think my partner got caught - no calls from him. We've been arrested for worse and he held it down so I'm not too worried about him. The European Sports Car kid got his girlfriend to pick him up and is fine - just left the impound, thrilled that his car is undamaged. He told the cops that he rented his car for drugs to some black guys and the evidently accepted that story.

Looks like I'm checking in to rehab tomorrow or Monday and it seems like a good thing. I've been a pretty tame junky until these last few months and that adrenaline rush is almost as good as a fat shot. Wow, I don't even know what to say - just glad I'm here to recount the story.

Stay safe people.",1377270944.0

He has no tolerance to opiates. He takes a lot of benzos and sleeping pills, but has no experience with hydro or oxy or anything of that nature. I was very worried last night when I went to see him, but he hadn't puked and was nodding hard. I used to abuse Oxy, so too many friends have died around me.
I called him last night and he answered telling me not to worry.
I've called him 3 times today to no answer. His car was still in his driveway when I left for work.
What's the likeliness of him overdosing on hydro? Or tylenol? At that rate? I'm worried.*


**So after several missed calls I show up at his place where he has almost completely fallen off of his fouton and is unresponsive.  After 20 doorbell rings his eyes flutter (his house has windows right into the living room from the porch).  He comes to the door rather angrily asking me what I want.  I respond that I was simply seeing if he was still living and what condition he was in.

His pupils were still contracted (the next day), but he seemed lucid.  His skin was reddish yellow, sunken and sweat covered.  He said he felt fine.  I knew that he passed the threshold of opiate overdose and was now a concern for tylenol issues with his liver.  I suggested taking him to doctor for liver testing...he refused.  I told him I'd be checking up on him periodically throughout the next couple days, but really what I wanted to do is tell poison control what is going on.  I did just that.

Poison control told me that unless he was in complete liver failure (AKA if he fit the criteria of boxes #1-10), they couldn't go off of just suspicions and worries.  For now I have been calling him every 2 hours for the past couple days to see how hes feeling, as well as showing up at his house to observe him in the flesh.

That's all I can do for now.  

Since he doesn't 'feel' sick or look 'too sick', 911 and poison control have told me they needed more.  I'm doing what I can until this passes, BUT I have no problem submitting him to a hospital, even if I do have to make it seem more extreme than it is**

Well, recently, I've been doing ""jitneys"" (rides) for my dude(s) as I've been broke and they usually throw me a few plus gas.. well I got my check a few days ago and naturally I don't want to ride them when I have a fat bank account..
As a result, they stopped answering me all day (they know one another) effectively making me sick as fuck at their amusement (jigs...) So after unsuccessfully trying for 6 HOURS I called my last hope type using friend who's on vacation and asked if he had any ideas.. first person he gives me # is shut off.. the second person answers, sounds cool as hell, and is about 5 mins from me. Awesome! So I go meet him very sketched out, wait about 5 mins and he hands me my bun (untaped..hate that.) So I drive home very anxious to look at them .. as I look at them in my car they seem weirdly colored (off-yellow egg colored) but I feel the folds and count ten so I say fuck it and think to myself even if they suck I have ten so fuck it.. cut to my bedroom .. fattest joints I've gotten in a while, all consistant, and very good.

I'm in Austin, TX, and I just yesterday did the intake for ""mars mdone clinic.""  The guy seemed really nice, and the word around town is that they're really reasonable and treat patients with respect and dignity.

I go in on Tuesday, and I know I have to give a UA, but that's about all I know. He also mentioned that they usually start you off around 30mg regardless of your habit, and that they expect you to use the first couple of days until you're on a comfortable maintenance dose.

At the age of 18 I was still in high school smoking pot and drinking excessively in a city far from my current one. 
When the days passed by, I continued my stupid personality by picking fights with stronger people on my brother's adderall because it made me feel unstoppable. 
Well, The bell rang for the end of class and I was jumped by a few of the kids I was threatening to beat up. 
A knee to the face and several kicks to the arm while I was down caused it to snap twice. 
So, I went straight to the hospital to get patched up and was prescribed a very low dose of vicodin which was nice I thought it'd be fun for the month. 
Those only lasted a week and by then I was extremely hook from that day forward.

So I've been using opiates on and off for a couple years (usually just poppy seed tea, codeine or morphine) on average a couple times a week, never going past 300mg of codeine.  Have never experienced withdrawals, always got a nice buzz, never noticed too much change with my tolerance.  A few months ago I found a source that had pretty insane prices on oxycodone (25c/mg), so I loaded up.  Never having taken oxy before, I took it pretty slow - started with 20mg IR, redosing 20mg every hour (soon every 30 minutes) until I realised I'd hit 120mg, and left it there.  Didn't use opiates for another week, then went back and did 120mg of oxy at once.  Got a pretty nice high, but didn't exactly get to the place I wanted to.  Waited another week, took 200mg at once, had a stronger high, but I wanted more.  The following week I took 300mg IR, then another 300mg two hours later.  That's 600mg of oxycodone in two hours and I was still standing.  Didn't feel sick, was functioning well, and I just assumed that I have an insane tolerance.  But how does someone who can tolerate that high a dose not get withdrawals?  If anyone has any answers for me I'd be very interested in hearing them, thanks in advance guys.",1377502894.0

I bet many of you have fantasized about getting back at someone who burned you. Well today I did. Story inside.,"I woke up sick today. Money had cleared in my account overnight so I went to go score first thing. I get to my dealers house and she isn't there. I didn't want to wait around sick for her, but I also didn't want to waste all my money on some lesser trade dope on the street. So I decided to just get a 20 to get well, and then wait around for my main person. It didn't take long before this guy calls me over to the corner he is standing on. I tell him what's up and he says if I give him a dollar and some change for the bus he will run into his dudes house and get me a twenty. Usually I would never agree, but I was sick and had a lot of money so 20 bucks wasn't that big of a deal. 

We walk to his guys house and he has me give him the money while I wait across the street. He pointed out the door he was going into and everything so I could see from where I was. Instead of going to the specified door, he walks around the house. I immediately start off after him. I get around the house just in time to see him running down an alleyway. I catch up to this fucker and he turns around and starts walking like he's gonna walk right past me. While he's walking to me I just ask for my money back because I really didn't want to fight because I was sick and all. So I step in front of him right before he walks out the alleyway and the motherfucker punches me right in the face. Hard. I don't know how, but I didn't flinch or anything. He backed up and put his hands up. I suddenly got a huge burst of adrenaline and I didn't feel my sickness anymore. I then proceeded to whip this guys ass. The fact that he was a head taller and had 30 to 40 pounds on me didn't matter. I land a sweet punch and he drops. On the way down I knee him right in the fucking face. I'm not the kind of guy who kicks a person while they're down, but keep in mind that this isn't a person. He is dirty junkie wanna-be-gangster scum. So I give him the most satisfying kick to the side of the head. I will probably dream about the sweet sound my Nike made as it connected with his temple until I'm an old man.

 As I'm walking back to where I chained up my bike I realize that I didn't get my fucking money. Fuck. But then an even better idea came to me. I figured he was going to buy dope first thing when he gets up. Thats what I would do if i got the shit beat out of me. I knew exactly who he was going to go to. Everyone in that area goes to the same guy that deals on the same few corners throughout the day. And I happened to know the guy pretty well. I tracked him down and told him what happened. He tells me that if the guy comes to him he won't sell to him. He also gets his phone out and tells the only other dealer in the area (they work together I guess) not to sell to this dickhead either. So I post up across the street and wait for the show.

 Sure enough, ten minutes later the thief shows up all bloody and, from what I could tell, missing a few teeth. He gets turned the fuck down and is just crushed. He just starts cursing and screaming until the look on his face turns from anger to despair, and finally, defeat. I watched him long enough to see him get up and start the mile long walk in the other dealers direction; a walk that he didn't know would end in vain

I was feeling great after all of this happened. I didn't even feel my sickness anymore. Right after the guy leaves my dealer called me and told me to head over. I told her what happened and she decided to hook me up fat. So I ended up making back that 20 plus some in the form of some of the sweetest, purest bth I have ever had. I FUCKING WON.",1377486656.0

First off, as with a few other subreddits, I'm pretty impressed with the knowledge in the comments here. I figured redditors might be able to help me out.

I'm just curious about a few things -- I have no interest in taking opiates and have never smoked cigarettes or weed (I'm 32) -- and I thought maybe you guys could help me understand a bit - and my questions aren't meant in a patronizing or disrespectful manner (I know tone is hard to convey in writing). 


So, two days ago, I lost my cousin at 33, presumably due to an OD - she had oxy and heroin problems for a long time (15-20 years, I'd say), and someone mentioned a patch so I'm assuming she had been doing fent or whatever relatively recently as well, but I really don't know the details as we haven't heard anything yet. She was a sweet, funny girl, and deserved much better, but we all saw this coming from light years away. She tried getting help, she was in and out of programs and jail, but nothing helped. So bummed.

I come from a big family, and my parents scared the shit out of us - I think only one of the five of us has even smoked pot, never mind smoking/snorting/shooting/popping anything else , so I admittedly don't get any of this - how does someone get started down this road? Why even start? Why keep going? What's the point of doing something you know you could become dependent upon, that'll likely cost you a ton of money, get you in trouble, and maybe even kill you? Is the high that worth it? Just so many questions...

Thanks for your input, it'd be nice to gain a little understanding of where her head may have been for all these years. I feel like I lost her ten years ago, and on Friday, I lost all hope of getting her back. 

Be careful out there.

I went to the doctor and got an X-ray. The results said something like 'there is a small indentation of the endplates at two locations'. The doctor hasn't told me what that means. My usual GP is on holiday and all I know is that this guy who's relieving thinks it doesn't hurt. He gave me a doctor's note to go and get some pharmacy only 200 mg ibuprofen + 12.8 mg codeine tablets, yes you heard right; 12.8 mg of codeine. 

Recently my family found out that I have tried Marijuana, LSD and a few other things, they basically think I'm a poly drug addict. It sounds pathetic but I believe that if I told them how much pain I'm in they'd think I'm making it up just to try and score some more drugs and get out of doing school work. Perhaps my biggest fear is that I am going insane and that this pain isn't even real. What the hell should I do?

In case you were wondering, yes I am still alive. It was a unique experience trying to find a vein, register, then plunge without moving the needle. The guide on the side bar suggested that I insufflate a bit to calm my nerves because I couldn't stop shaking. I took a shower and drank water to help find a vein but I still turned my left arm into hamburger trying to poke the elusive bastard. I was getting more pop on the back of my hand and finally got it in.

OMG that rush! I wish I hadn't snorted the other half cuz I get way more bang for my buck with a needle. That feeling cannot be unfelt just like the first time we all tried opiates. I had to buy 100 at Walmart so now I have 99 left. I even went so far as to wash my cotton and after turning my hand into hamburger I was able to get it in my left arm.

Damn it! This took way to long to update cuz of the nods.

-----------------------------------------------------

So I decided to try IV for the first time (I know, I know don't do it 'drugs go in the nose') I'm a big boy and I want to IV cuz I only have .1 left. So I go round to CVS, Rite Aid, Kroger, and (local pharmacy with ~20 stores) and get the same shit from each of them about not selling unless you get your insulin/B12 scrip from us or can prove you have a scrip at another pharmacy.

This is exactly what I say to them: ""I need a bag of 10, 1cc, 30 gauge, 1/2 inch syringes."" They say, ""do you have your scrip here with us?"". I say, ""No I'm from out of town (have the ID to back it up) and ran out because I wasn't watching my diet. I don't like to use my syringes more then once."" They say either, ""You have to fill with us to buy some."" or they say ""What pharmacy do you have a prescription with and we'll call to confirm."" Of coarse the fake pharmacy name doesn't pull up shit. A couple even say it's OK if I run to my hotel room and bring them back my bottle of insulin as proof but I don't have any insulin.

Now what can I do to get my rigs? Please help me out guys!

Note: I was high as a mother-fucker so that could have been the reason. Also there is no state law against selling them to me it is just their policy.",1377584540.0

That didn't happen because I had to take my poor baby to the pediatrician then the ear, nose, and throat doctor. She has an ear infection and strep. She's in great spirits and the ENT said she was going to be fine, mild antibiotics and some baby cough syrup for her poor congested chest. Then I got an unexpected call, an old friend that I haven't seen in a while I immediately picked up and said ""What's up!"" ""Hey man are you free tonight?"" he replied. 'Yeah after 8 I'm off work. You coming to town?"" ""Yes sir, I'll be at your house when you get home. Get some smokes and a bag of loud, I've spent all my money on delicious drugs and I bought you a badass glass bong at a flea market last weekend."" he garbled between bites of some sort of nasty gas station fare I wouldn't even touch. ""Dude you're the SHIT. I'll see you in a little while."" ""Love you bro, I got something for Liv too!""  I didn't know what to say so I stuttered out a well deserved, ""I love you brother."" I hung up, ecstatic to see my friend and absolutely floored by memories of how generous and caring this particular friend has been to me my entire life. I also couldn't wait to see my new bong and see what he meant when he said spent all money on drugs. Work lasted forever. Asshole co-worker comes in 2 hours after me when I've already load and unloaded the truck, set all the food up, and served half of the people we were feeding tonight. That's not the problem, that's normal, he gets off his other job late and comes in right after everytime I work with him. This time he said to me ""I don't wash dishes. How many jobs do you work?"" So I say back to him ""I only work this one but I've done literally everything else, you clean the salad bar and do the dishes, it's fair now quit whining like a bitch."" This little 5'1"" douchebag with a hatchetman tattoo and dramatic emo hair says to me, ""You better watch what the fuck you say!"" After I rolled on the floor laughing at his best gangster impression I said simply ""I will break you in half. Quit being a baby and crying because you have to do some work because I did way fucking more than you."" He puffed down immediately when he saw I wouldn't be intimidated by his little bitch ass. Work finished up and I shot over to my guy with the best bud in town. I bought an eighth for $45 and shot home. The green was loud like my buddy wanted alright! I go in and he's playing with Liv swinging her around and making her laugh. I gave him a hug and the bud and hopped in the shower. Fastest shower ever. I come out and mom and liv had gone to the store and the park to give us a little while alone to catch up and get high and plan what we're gonna do for the 3 days he's here. We went upstairs to the man cave and he wopped out a huge finger of fire ass dope! We broke some up and immediately went to snorting. After we got good and high he asked if I'd like to buy a little so he would have a few bucks so he wouldn't have to bum off me the whole time he was here, I said sure and pulled out $70 and handed it right to him. Then I gave him another $20 because we're going to be going out and having a good time. He broke me off at least 1.3 and I stared in disbelief he assured me he meant too and wopped out a big ole bag of the snowy hag herself! I was beside myself at this point, what else do you have in those magic pockets of happiness friend? He opened it and scooped out about a quarter of the bag, like 10 or 12 FAT rails. broke 2 down really nice and we did them at the same time. I've never mixed heroin and coke before but god damn I  am I high as a kite. I'm amazed I am this coherent. It's probably the coke. The night went on like that for a while and we did a bit more dope, (both relative lightweights, .3 gets us fucked up!) He passed out a while ago and now I'm writing this to share with all you good folks on my favorite subreddit! Sorry it's so long and happy nods to all of you. Be careful out there. 

TL;DR Day started crappy. Baby sick and asshole co-worker. Old friend came to town, hooked me up soooooo good, bad ass glass bong too, and is staying with me for a few days. Excellent end to my day and great start on an even better 3 days! Fucking great guy. Happy nods everyone",1377583802.0

Heroin.,"Sometimes I dream of the warm embrace that the snug blanket of opiates provide. Sometimes I curse this poison. Sometimes I want to use for the rest of my life. Sometimes I want to end it. End this never ending dilemma that seems to be more than just maintaining the tiny bit of stability and sanity I have left. End the everyday struggle to not be sick, to function, to act like a normal person, son, brother, friend... End having to rely on a substance to give me piece of mind. But then again, that rush sounds really good right about now.

I have been using for so long now that I don't know who I am without heroin. When I'm sober I spend my time trying to occupy my time with things that don't interest me, relationships that don't mean shit, achieving goals that aren't important: unless I'm using... When I use, the whole world brightens up. I take interest in things I wouldn't usually give a second of my time to. Social interactions are engaging and meaningful, no matter how brief they are. I find beauty and meaning in the smallest of occurrences. 

When I'm sick or sober, however, things are more black and white. My life is strained into two dimensions. Trying to get high (at this point I should call it getting normal), and trying to stay sober. More often than not, I attempt former. The pit of addiction is not dark or bright, its grey, it's bland. While using I can predict the events of everyday before they happen, and usually, the result as well. Nothing new ever happens. Nothing special, nothing particularly bad. This existence is not what life should be. 

Life should be filled with new and exotic experiences all the time! There should be excitement and joy, as well as sadness. But my life on drugs is filled with emptiness. I can see why I should get sober. I could have a much better life. One filled with various experiences. I would be able to draw joy out of small things. And be able to achieve long term goals that would bring even greater happiness. You know what? That's it right there. I want to feel that happiness that feels so far away right now. I'm going to clean up my life. Become a better person. Have a better existence. But then again...that rush sounds really nice right about now.",1377577242.0

So many morons in this society claim to be against prohibition, but the minute you mention 'bad' drugs like cocaine, Heroin, and methamphetamine, and suddenly it's a variation of 'Are you joking?  We can't have a country full of drug addicts running around.'. Full fingers in the ears treatment when you try and differentiate problems created by use of the drug, versus problems created by criminalizing the drugs themselves and anybody associated with them. 

Political diatribes aside, I haven't got any decent information on the subject, other than reading trip reports.  And the problem with those is they're often written as stories about combining these drugs.  I'm more interested in a simple discussion of the effects you guys have experienced taking these mixtures.  IV psychedelic experiences would be great to hear about in particular. 

Personally I've dropped acid while coming down off H, and that was terrible.  My body was starving but I figured I'd wait to trip before I started eating.  The acid made my stomach feel too weird to eat and being that hungry sent me on a bad trip through the Panic Zone.  It wasn't until I got it together and threw on Portlandia that I was able to relax, and by then my trip was dead, just six hours in. 

And I took Crystal X about an hour after taking H, this was a nice high because the opioid depression counteracted the jittery stimulation of the ecstasy.  The two body highs are distinct and it was fun having both at once, but the highs never synchronized and became something else, the way certain combinations will.  Took some more Heroin after the peak too, and that made the come down fantastic.  Took more the day after too and it got rid of any suffering from any potential crack out. ",1377554386.0

[rant] [longwinded] [pointless],"So this guy with whom I have been friends for years, and things have always been cool with, suddenly has turned...okay, well, gradually has become kind of a shady ass, and I think it's due to his ancient girlfriend.

Basically, Brian (not real name) and I have lived together, ODed together, and talked about great music and other crap, and really enjoy each other's company. The last few times I've tried to hang out with him, when I can actually get him, his current girlfriend has been there as well. She's super clingy and about 16 years older than he is. She dominates the conversations when he's there, to the point of talking over him, doesn't allow him to do anything alone without extreme guilt, points out all the favors she does ""for him"", such as once coming up with 100 dollars for a bag as if he was the only one doing any of it, and he's just too nice and guileless to really go against it. This is all well and good, as long as he's happy, but I think she's really gone too far.

This last time, I went to get a bag through them and their connect, Amy. Every other time I've had Amy's stuff it has been great. The last time the bag was untied, but it wasn't too small for a 40 so I just overlooked it. Alarm bells went off when Brian said he had to keep this aquisition from Aida (as we will call his girlfriend) for whatever reason.

This time, I give Brian 60 bucks for the bag, and he and Aida make a big deal about getting it (as usual---apparently, Amy doesn't meet anyone new blah blah blah pretty much means Aida doesn't want me to get Amy's number). The bag is delivered to my work after I've been cutting up carrots and tofu all dopesick and nasty, and Brian immediately says ""yeah, it has a small hole in it, but not much fell out and it should be great etc etc etc"" and I frankly don't care at this point due to the sickness. This 60 bag is significantly smaller than the 40 I got before, the knot had obviously been picked at and abandoned in favor of this ""hole"" that apparently was in the bag, because dealers do that all the time. Also, Amy's dope has always dissolved without heat and without leaving a residue. This stuff left a salty looking powder all over the bottom, and I barely felt anything off of it. When confronted, Brian starts confabulating ""Oh, well, Amy usually gives other people worse stuff than she gives me,"" which is some obvious bullshit because dealers want to stay in business. I try to give him some leading questions so that he'll admit that they adulterated it and took more than half of my bag, but he won't come clean (no pun intended). Basically, they used my 60 bucks to convince Amy it was worth her while to come out, then they claimed they had 60 also (I saw the text, they only had 40), then gave me a tiny bit of dope and a large amount of some random bullshit. I know it was Aida's influence, because Brian doesn't think of this crap himself, and he also just wouldn't, but he's really easily influenced. When she's around he just lies and does crap that isn't in his nature.


I'm just sick of this crap. I don't do it to others and I don't want it done to me. If they just straight asked me, ""hey, can we tax you a little for hooking you up?"" I'd gladly have said yes....well, grudgingly, but still, I'd have agreed. But adulterating my stuff and lying about it is just bullshit. I'm not sure what to do. I dont want to lose Brian as a friend, but this is going a little far for me. ",1377543616.0

my new doctor in south carolina has been cool, no tests, but now they sprung a contract on me and i have to give a UA but they send it off to a lab.  if it was dipstick i would be fine, but they are seeing the exact levels in my urine to see if im taking all my sub as well so its a little more indepth.

i smoke weed and maybe use etiz. anyone know if using a stinger drink, which masks for a 4 hr period, would work through a lab?  i know they are going to see raised creatine and b12 levels from the drink and im not sure if i can say i was taking supplements.  i know with stinger you have to drink about 30 oz of water over a couple hrs beforehand, so i know it would be diluted slightly.

im only worried about getting the weed and etiz out, but does anyone have experience with lab tests from sub docs?

believe me I have passed sooo many tests, its just theyve never sprung a lab test THIS indepth before",1377537349.0

Have physical dependence, not getting high dependence.","hi guys, hoping you can give me some advice.

Posted this in opiatesrecovery too, but they don't seem to get much traffic. lol

I want to get off opioids, it's just become too much to deal with.  My tolerance kept getting higher and Dr. didn't want to keep giving me more, so I wasn't getting my pain relief.  Running out a week early, all the calls to the Dr. office to be sure he will be in so I can get a script written, wondering if he will write them each month, waiting at the pharmacy sick as shit to see if they will fill them 2 days early, looking at your pill count each day wondering how you're going to make it 30 days.  Let's not forget the fucking wd's too.  

I take pain meds due to chronic pain.  It's never going to go away and is only going to get worse.  I've been on pain meds for 3 years now, no breaks-a solid 3 years.  Currently I'm taking 60mg of MS-Contin and 100mg of Oxycodone daily.  I've been taking this amount for quite awhile.  I have never got high from taking them and have never abused them to try and get high.  Don't get me wrong, I would love to get high, but I can't take most of my meds to get high one time a day, I need them for pain.

The WD's have always really rocked my ass.  I've never made it past 3 days.  One time I had to go to the ER, I was out of my skull.  A few days ago, I tried to quit cold turkey again and after 3 days I broke down and called the Dr who gave me a 2 week supply and told me he wanted me to go on methadone.  He's just some small town Dr. that doesn't really know a whole a whole lot about this kind of shit.  I'm sure he doesn't treat to many opioid addicts, so he just looks shit up.

I don't have any insurance, I live on disability and I have no money, no assets, no one to help me in any way, so I need to find a way to get off this shit, but without spending money on Dr. visits and expensive meds.

My questions:

1. What are your thoughts on trying to taper off by cutting down my oxy intake every week, in hopes that wd's will be easier to deal with when stopping altogether.  The Dr. would hopefully prescribe me some meds to help with the wd's too.  How quick could I taper down you think?  I currently take about 160mg a day.  Is 30-40mg decrease a week too much, or do you think I could do it even faster?

2. My Dr. wants to do some sort of methadone treatment, but he's a small hick town family Dr and will probably read whatever guide he uses and just go off that.  Is there a quick taper using Methadone?  Since I use pain meds for chronic pain, and don't get high off them, I am not having to deal with a addiction based on getting high.  Meaning my biggest problem is just getting thru the wd's.  I don't have the added pressure of chasing a ""high"".  I have read about methadone and it seems this should be a last resort and is used for people that not only trying to get thru the physical issues, but also ones that have to deal with the mental part of the desire to get high.

3. Is Subutex or suboxone a better choice for me, then methadone?  For someone that does not have to deal with the mental addiction of getting high, in addition to the physical dependence?  Any idea how much it costs, for someone with no insurance?

4. What drugs should I ask for to help me with my wd's?  Clonidine would be one for sure to help with the anxiety and heart racing.  What else should I ask for? Something to help me sleep for sure.  My biggest problems with wd's are the anxiety and heart pounding, the restless leg syndrome and the hot/cold sweats at the same time.  The squirts can be helped by loperimide.  Loperimide did not help me enough last time.  I'm not taking 50 pills a day of that shit. 

Thanks much for any help!

in a world so bleak, what goods deciding to change?

she's too amazing - plus my prides always right in the way

the warm embrace let me know that it's real

and seemed to fix everything that i was hoping to heal

but people say it doesn't count if you're coping with pills

or the dope - i'm in love with the emotions they steal

overloadin' my receptors, she's so potent i kneel

I sat down and focused on my breathing, and after 5 minutes or so it passed, and I felt normal (very high, but nothing scary.)

The reason I'm confused is because I've always associated ODing with nodding out and not waking up, or just pretty much the opposite of what happened with me..i.e. the racing heart, tremor etc.
I didn't feel noddy at all;  in fact, I felt pretty much the opposite of that.

1lg2ax,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1lg2ax/dependence_vs_addiction/,38,https://redd.it/1lg2ax,SmackHappie,Dependence v.s. Addiction,"People often confuse the two and have little concept of the difference. Dependence upon a drug is a physical phenomenon  (sometimes wrongly called physical addiction) caused by cells adaptation to drug effects and a few culprits include drugs like atenolol , diazepam, and etorphine. These drugs don't always cause addiction but dependence is a factor in addiction. Addiction (labeled by some wrongly as psychological dependence) CAN BE caused by any drug that has a positive effect(s) and/or negative consequences when discontinued. Addiction is learned over time and is characterized by an inability to: cease, curtail, decrease, desist, or otherwise modify usage; additionally addiction has some manner of negative impact on an addicts life and there will likely be a strong urge to use the drug. If that latter sentence doesn't describe you then it doesn't matter if you get sick when you stop a drug, you aren't addicted to it. Overall the language used to describe addiction and dependence is a bit murky but there's a clear difference between the two that some people don't appreciate.

TL;DR Addiction is more of a neurocognitive/operant  process and dependence is simply your cells in a specific area adapting to a drugs effects (e.g. upregulation).   ",1377923692.0

Although addiction has various signs and components I think that it most resembles a symptom of disorder like overeating. For example, overeating has various signs (e.g. weight gain) but it isn't a disorder/disease in its own right. I feel that this is a better way to conceptualize drug use/addiction because what's needed is treatment of the underlying condition. I know some treatment programs address things like depression but most don't make it a main focus.

My group was small, it included the person I lost (We will call her Rainbow), her SO, a few close friends from our past, and I. Rainbow, her SO, and I  were inseparable for the longest time. We were the three musketeers. I was there for the beginning and the end of their relationship, and they were also my using buddys for a long time before they stopped using everything except weed. However, in the short time since Rainbow passed away my usage has increased substantially from where I was, along with some new things, for example, H. I always knew I would love H just from hearing detailed descriptions of it's effects and from using other pharmaceutical opiates. Rainbow's SO is very against my drug use and she recently has become aware to the full extent of it. Now, she doesn't talk to me because of what she knows I dabble into, and it's making my depression, suicidal tendencies, and all around self-destructiveness a million times worse. I wish she could understand that this is what I need to keep myself from finally making the move I contemplate on a daily basis, to get high, and to talk to her. Only one friend died, but I lost them both. The rest of the 'old' friend group won't ask me anything, but would rather assume and infer and discuss their alleged findings among themselves.

After that just aleve. The first 2 days weren't too bad, because of the subs, and after that its just hell. I'm on day 7 now, and the rls is making me go insane, I can't sleep 15 minutes because of it. The last time I withdrew the rls subsided by day 4, here I am on 7 and it seems to be getting worse.

I'm seeing three different doctors and a dentist for legitimate reasons and have recently read about pharmacists getting involved and raising red flags if they see opiates being prescribed by multiple doctors that overlap.  At what levels/amounts does this start to raise these red flags?

When does seeing multiple doctors legitimately look like ""doctor shopping""? 

I have seen my primary care doctor for 12 years and was prescribed Fioriciet 35 ct on july 23 and aug 35 for migraines.

I am also seen a neurologist that prescribes mostly triptans (not a concern obviously) but my insurance limits those, so prescribed 24 percocet 10 days ago, but the pharmacy only had 15. I just took the 15 rather than wait - it was for a holiday weekend as a back up in case the migraines were unbearable without having any triptans.

A side effect of the migraine preventative I am currently taking under the care of the neurologist is insanely painful menstrual cramps.  My gynecologist prescribed me norco at the first set of these cramps Jul 27 (40 pills with a refill of 40 and I took all of them, the period lasted 10 days).  

When my next period started 5 days ago, I called my gyno and asked for a refil on the norco and she gave me a refil of 30.

Here is my question:

I have a dental appointment coming up on Sept. 12.  I have extreme gum issues and my dentist will fill a prescription for me of norco, if I ask for it, after my appointment, for pain. I will probably have leftover medication from my current prescription, but I am not sure, I am still having pain right now. I have an ultrasound scheduled for my uterus the day after tomorrow.

Regardless, that would be now a third doctor (dentist) prescribing an opiate for a different issue (gums).  Will my pharmacy consider this a red flag?  Second, am I putting myself at risk for addiction? I am not taking them round the clock.

What do pharmacies consider doctor shopping and how many refills of opiates do they consider a red flag?

I did a few small lines one morning, unsure of the dosage and wary of the purity so I was taking it slow. I basically felt a slight warmth and detachment from the world wash over me. It almost made me feel a little bit anxious because it felt similar to being depersonalised. Ended up throwing the rest away two weeks later as neither me or my friend could be bothered doing it, though this was more to do with us finishing a large alcohol binge and just wanting to be sober. 

Since I was so underwhelmed I bought some heroin off the silk road when I got home. Just .1g and I snorted 50mg then another 50mg and felt much the same, no euphoria. Just recently my friend wanted to try some so I bought .25g though decided I didn't want to be the one to introduce him to it so I've done it alone across 3 nights. Still the same lack of euphoria, just slightly content and itchy. Anyone else just not enjoy heroin? I can only assume it's good stuff because the vendor reviews are good.

As an aside, 35mg of OC is amazing and I take DHC every now and then and really enjoy that but even with those two, the OC isn't worth the money and the DHC isn't worth the effort of faking symptoms to my pharmacist.

First off, I'm not IVing. I'd prefer to snort, and almost completely refuse to smoke (with no means to plug efficiently.)


I've been doing a lot of research, but can't figure out if what I have is soluble in water or not. You might ask, well try it and see if it is! Well I did, but I don't know how soluble is ""water soluble."" I now have brown water, but there are still a few tiny tiny granules in the spoon. It's impossible to gets, so this is the best I can do.

The H itself looks like this:
http://i.imgur.com/f9YyCh1.jpg
It clumps together whenever it's warmer, but when I first got it it was completely powder/small rock form. 


What do you guys think? Will this work as ""monkey water"" or even just straight sniffing the powder?

Notes about tolerance: I used to be prescribed 120 oxycodone 10/325, and 90 OxyContin 60mg every 30 days (Midwest doctors f yeah).... Which in the long run pretty much ruined my life. 

I've managed to get my tolerance to a respectable 30mg oxycodone (percocet) daily, so I'd be taking baby BABY steps with this as I'm a paranoid/anxious person/hypochondriac by design.

Any (quick) help would be 👍

I couldn't take it anymore: being broke all the time, the double life, the occasional need to steal to get me well. A couple weeks ago my best friend and I decided to check ourselves in. I did a 5 day detox and an outpatient program, which I am currently attending 3 days a week.

My buddy, however, could not get his insurance to cover any programs nearby. They ended up covering him for a program over 1000 miles away. So I thought, ""cool, at least he's getting clean too."" I was glad I'd be getting my shit together, and proud as hell of my friend who has been in this game much longer than I have (about 10 years, 3 for me).

So anyway, I get out of the detox program, and all I can think about is getting high. So dig out one of the few rigs that I had forgotten to throw away before and scrape up some money and get some bags. And it was all I could have hoped for, and maybe even more. I realized at that moment... I fucking love dope! I've been taking it easy to try and avoid getting where I was, but to be honest I'm not too far from there now.

And then, a couple days ago I was having a conversation with my friend's brother. Apparently he told his mom on the phone that he's not planning on coming back; he wants to try to make it on his own out there. Now, part of me is still super proud of him for wanting to better himself. BUT, a huge part of me is considering these two things:

1. Everything I've heard about suggests you can't run away from an addiction. My understanding is dope is less abundant where he is, but I'm sure he could find it if he really wanted.

2. I want my friend back! Seriously, we've been inseparable for the past 6 months or so, and I feel like I'm withdrawing from his company as much as I am from the dope. I feel selfish as fuck for this one, but... c'mon man!

Anyways, here I am now, using regularly and trying REALLY hard not to get caught. Everyone at my work and in my family knows what's up, so everybody's going to be looking for any signs they can to peg my use. But I just can't seem to care. I love my drugs. It's that simple. I'm probably going to get kicked out of my outpatient group for failing the UAs. But I don't care... I'm there by my own choice, and I can get kicked out by my own actions.

At least he'll still help me out at all. Writing this shit down is probably the longest reprieve I'll get from torturing myself mentally until the phone rings again. At least it's the good shit. He had some really good shit last week. Said it was the same batch. That's nice.

I haven't had anything since Monday morning, and it's Thursday night here. Someone in an askreddit thread about addiction put it eloquently the other day - in response to someone saying that you ""never catch the dragon"", they said that every time they fix after two or three days of WD's, it's like they're swimming in a sea of dragons. That's about right. Going from four days sober after a midsize bender, it's gonna feel way better than the first time.

Ten...

Do you think the mscontin and the oxy would be a good combo or would that not be enough.  Should I just try to get more hydro and do like 15-20mg hydro with the oxy or the mscontin?  Also if I were to do the methadone should I only take half, and will I feel it the next day if I take it around noon?  Also since there is no apap in the oxy, if I just ate or railed it and had a few beers would that be alright or would the oxy by itself not be enough?  I forgot, I also have a single 2mg xanax bar but the last time I took that with the hydro I got very uncomfortable and was nervous about going to sleep and I only took a third of a bar. I will most likely be smoking weed as well for all of these possibilities.  Thanks and sorry for all the questions!",1378369153.0

Heres a picture of it:

http://i43.tinypic.com/2wpjkpc.jpg

I have a few questions:

1. Can I plug this stuff if I dilute it with water because 4mg/1ml is way to concentrated.

2. Is there a way to convert it into powder that can be snorted?

3. I have been clean for 8 months so I technically have a tolerance of ""0"" so how much would I need to use to get a decent high? Previous DOC was Roxy 30 IR about 6-10/day but like I said, been clean for 8 months now.

4. Once I puncture the bag, how can I preserve this stuff?

5. Not a question but nonetheless.. I will not be IV'ing it no matter what so please do not tell me to throw it out or give it to someone else if I wont be IV'ing it.

This passed July I had an intense experience:

So I was in a small town in British Columbia and a few buddies were grabbing weed and coke of this local quite eccentric guy. Tagging along for one of their pickups I found out he also had some heroin. Being a super nice guy, he lets me sample some of his stash, probably about a 0.3g white chunck he handed me.

I had only ever seen whitesh-brown and whitesh-grey before, so I didn't know what to make of it as I inspected it back at home base later that day. The consistency was unfamiliar, I was used to a hard dirt clump texture or powder where this crumbled more like a piece of chalk.

I decide to smoke a tiny amount to test its strength since my tolerance was down to nothing. It melted differently than I expected. Turned into a clear beaded liquid which vaporized almost instantly leaving behind barely a residue. I don't feel anything, so I shoot an equivalent amount. I can feel the relaxing opiate effect, but not much else.

After an hour I decide it's time to do a real hit. It didn't look like a lot when I dumped it into my makeshift tinfoil spoon, maybe 3X as much as what I had hit earlier. Boy was I wrong. After pushing the plunger I quickly loosened the belt on my arm and felt it take hold. The strength of that first rush told me this was gonna be good, but that rush didn't calm down, it just kept building...stronger and stonger. I think to myself 'shit this is gonna be intense, better lay back and enjoy it'
So I end up in a state where I was able to continue thougts in my mind, but if someone has tried to talk to me I wouldn't have been able to respond. I remember I was listening to the demon days album by the gorillaz and being fully convinced the lyrics to 'last living souls' was actually an anecdote of what had just happened to me, singing about how I had just shot up and was now in completely bliss, yet confused as to why I couldn't sit back up. i have no clue how long I was out, but by the time i finally got my mind to convince my body to move the sun had gone down. Then, nausea and panick. I got up to walk over to a friend who was camped in the forest. If anyone had seen me they would have thought I was completely shit faced by all the stumbling I was doing. When I got to her tent I threw up about 5 times, then curled up in the fetal position and fell asleep. In the morning I was still nauseous as fuck. Threw up my first breakfast, but managed to keep down the second, and recovered from there.

So at the time i was terrified because I had never been so high and out of control of my own body. Now that I look back I just think it was trippy as fuck, being in that half dream state and connecting with the music like that (the vomiting and panick not so great).",1378343361.0

I am new to reddit and kinda want to get myself familiarized and myself with the community.
Anyway just recently moved away from my old city where I used to be able to get anything 
with mild amount of waiting and to make it worse I had just started getting the lowest prices 
I've paid there in my life (been using heroin off and on for 5-6 years and other drugs for 9-10).
So I'm back up at college and my friend up here that used to use can't help me and doesn't 
know anyone for anything more than OCs and with OCs and well lets be honest they're only in
supply for about 1 week every month and are way too pricey. So I get on subs and continue 
living on, but it isn't enough so I buy some OCs and sell some subs here and there, until I 
stupidly run out of subs and there is no OCs around what a surprise withdrawals! So I try to 
cold cop with $40 and  get stiffed. Well I get my new script and stop looking for trouble then 
something switches in my brain and I am out cold copping again and this time I find a crack 
user waiting for money from a western union. She hops in my car and off we go to get me $40 
worth she comes back with 2 plastic baggies of dope I immediately shoot both before I give her 
some money to get her crack. Then about a month later I do this again but this time find a man 
crack user and do the same for him $40 for 2 waxpaper bags this time and much better stuff 
and gave him money for crack and he gives me his number. Now this guy starts calling and 
texting me up a storm so I get middled from him one more time $20/bag and $10-$20 for him. 
Also forgot to mention I shoot my subs.

**TL;DR: New town, cold copped, got a middleman's number, he won't stop calling me, 
sick of paying $20/bag.**

I've been looking into SR as I would actually be saving money, but seems like a hassle.

I was an idiot and slept all day when I should've been running my hustle train. Woke up late, still made my hustle, only to find out that since I fell asleep my only connect/middleman promised his girl he wouldn't go score with me and there was no way he could leave with me even though I had a pocket full of money, and, the most important factor, the wheels. 




So I get home super disappointed after running my hustle but happy I've got a bill in my pocket from the day's work. I'm now looking at waiting 4-5 more hours until I can score. I woke up at 3AM sick as fuck having only dosed last yesterday around 9AM. Couldn't find my motherfucking lope, so I grabbed the subs I've been stashing (my ma gives me a half of an 8 mg every day... I hide them, say I took them, and then go get dope instead.... DON'T JUDGE ME) broke off a third of a 4mg, let it dissolve /almost/ all the way, swish the nasty orange saliva around in my mouth, swallow. 4:30 AM and I'm still sick. I go ahead and do the same with another third of a 4mg piece. About 40 minutes ago, lo and behold, I find my fucking lope. Whyyy. I'm a fucktard so I'm still slamming a shot as soon as I get this gram today in a few hours. I'm going to make it quite a bit fatter than usual. I'm hoping it will ""break through"" like it did with me last time (took 4mg, let it half dissolve then swallowed it, 5 hours later took a shot and was smacked the fuck back). If not, no harm, no foul. I'm a good hustler and even if I take a pretty large shot by my standards, I should still have a little under a G tonight. By the time I cop today the time since I last took a sub will be around 7 hours.




Also, I got my Eddie McDowd (fuck yeah if you remember that show) on and rescued a lil babeh meece that I found stuck to a sticky pad I had put in my room. Its squeaking just broke my little shriveled heart, so I took the sticky pad into the backyard, poured some oil over him a la Willard, and unstuck his lil baby ass. He's sitting in a metal bowl out back while he dries/cleans himself with some nugs of dog food for grubbage. I feel like mother fuckin Theresa over here. I love pet rats, abhorr wild mice/rats, but he was soooo kewt I had to save him. Maybe if I'm lucky, he'll come back and start nesting in my room with a family. I kid, I kid. Then I'd have to burn the entire fucking house down. That was my good deed for the day besides breaking off my middleman fat.




Speaking of my middleman, goddamn he is so cute. Really sucks to see a fellow junkie in a relationship with a non-user who doesn't understand at all (especially the sickness... A user can't convey ever how fucking horrible being dopesick feels, and they will never understand. I wouldn't wish being dopesick on my worst enemy, fuck, at least not the WD's I remember.) and treats him like shit. She never stops with her fuckin bitching.  Then again I'm sure he and I would be at each others throats over dope were it me and him together rather than him and her. You just can't win. But he's just in a really shitty situation, and he's a good guy, so it hurts what's left of my blackened and largely unused feels. Wish I could help him out some way, get him away from that chick he's with (I'm not a homewrecker, and I get the feeling he's kind of using her at this point), but she's providing shelter for him and he's like on the other side of the country from ""home"". Meh. Just some random thoughts.





I'll post some pr0n of the needle and smack variety when I get back today. Pray to the fucking opiate gods this happens. I think I'm gonna grab some trees right quick, kinda pass the time a little faster and make me feel better.

What are your craziest pickup stories?,"Hey guys, long time lurker first time poster. I'm a huge fan of this subreddit and love the community here. 

Now I know this may not be considered crazy to some people but it was insane to me. Hope you enjoy.

I'm just so happy right now. I've been sick as hell all day. My girl came over early yesterday morning to grab my cash so she could go score for us. When she pulled onto the road there were 6 cops at dude's house. She came back and returned my money but that was my only connect. So I had to go to work sick as fuck, sweating, shaking, trying not to shit myself... you all know about that i'm sure. So I come home and sit calling people non stop trying to find anything at all. I went to bed at midnight facing the fact that I would be up tossing and turning all night. At 3 am I get that amazing text ""3's""
HOLY SHIT! I jump up out of bed and realize, I don't have a car and I have no way to get there and he can't come to me. SHIT.

But then I remember my friend that works night shift. I ask if he can give me a ride and he says yes!! SCORE!

So my dude asks me to bring him some weed to trade on the pills. I put it in a cellophane and stuck it in my sock and off I went to score my 3's. Almost there when a car comes right up on our ass and all i see are blue lights. ""DAMN HOMIE WE'RE GETTING PULLED OVER EAT THAT WEED!""

I proceed to take the whole half gram and swallow it. The cop gets in the other lane and speeds past us with his lights on. Wtf, I just ate my weed for nothing.Then I walk in and this is a new hookup. Its a friend of mine that is staying there but the pills belonged to someone else. So when i walk in the dude with the pills is smoking meth off of a tin foil and hes about 150 pounds heavier than me and has huge muscles, and he walks up to me and gets right in my face and says ""are you the mother fucking police?""

uh.. no man. Jon can vouch for me hes known me forever. 

""ok but you have to do one in front of me so i know you aren't a rat""

Supposedly it's really effective for temporarily reducing tolerance to opoids.,"It's available from some online kratom vendors.

Quoted from [this](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/opiates/opiates_info3.shtml) article:

> However, many people are unaware that both enhanced effectiveness of narcotic analgesics AND prevention or reversal of tolerance is readily achievable through the oral use of up to 200-250 mg of Proglumide [(DL)-4-Benzamido-N,N-dipropylglutaramic acid]. [See Ott 1999; Watkins et al. 1984]
> 
> The work of Watkins suggests there may be a therapeutic dosage window with diminished results above it but more detailed work to define this is apparently lacking.
> 
> Rather than simply augment the action of the opiates, proglumide actually interferes with the anti-opioid activity of the neuropeptide CCK.
> 
> The chronic administration of opiates, or spinal cord and other CNS injuries, elevates the level of Cholecystokinin (CCK) that is present. Such elevated levels exert an antagonistic effect on opioid activity resulting in significantly diminished analgesic effects. (Watkins et al. 1984; Xu et al. 1993 & 1994)
> 
> It is this rise in CCK levels that directly leads to the condition known as drug tolerance and the corresponding increase in its anti-opioid activity that requires the opiate user to use increasingly larger amounts to achieve the same effects.
> 
> This anti-opiate effect can be prevented or even reversed through the administration of CCK inhibitors such as proglumide. (Watkins et al. 1984)
> 
> Besides just interfering with the adverse action of CCK on opiate activity, proglumide is also known to augment the analgesic effect of opiates. Often this can provide a higher quality of analgesia for those patients who suffer from an incomplete response to pain medications.
> 
> Watkins & coworkers reported that proglumide reversed morphine tolerance and also 1) hastened the onset of analgesia, 2) increased the peak levels, and 3) prolonged the duration. 
> 
> They suggested that not simply did this indicate that effective narcotic doses could be decreased but it also indicated that proglumide might be able to enhance the effects of other procedures, such as acupuncture, which involve endogenous opiates. (Watkins et al. 1984)
> 
> Proglumide is a nonselective CCK inhibitor that was formerly employed as an anti-ulcer medication (Hahne et al. 1981). It shows NO analgesic effects of its own.
> 
> Although proglumide is now considered to be an obsolete pharmaceutical due to changes in our understandings of ulcer etiology, it has already seen extensive pharmacological and toxicological testing proving its safety and has been approved for use in humans. 
> 
> It has largely fallen into disuse but is still available in bulk via chemical houses or as a pharmaceutical in Europe and Africa sold under the trade name Milid and Milide.
> 
> Other CCK inhibitors show similar properties (Idänpään-Heikkilä et al. 1997; Xu et al. 1993). However, beyond simply having seen previous use in humans, proglumide is both inexpensive and nontoxic. (Ott 1999)
> 
> Proglumide is not some sort of magic bullet for completely eliminating the risk of tolerance development and addiction as its effects are only effective for a limited duration before tolerance to IT begins to develop. (After 8 days its effectiveness begins to wane) The work of Kellstein & Mayer 1990 suggests that successful therapeutic/maintenance applications will probably require its discontinuation for a week after each week of use. More work is needed to better define the precise parameters of its effective use for this purpose.
> 
> Despite this, proglumide has already demonstrated itself to be of value both in pain management and as an adjunct to maintaining a narcotic addiction within a larger program of harm reduction (Anonymous 2000; Ott 1999).

I've been using opiates for more years than I'd like to admit and am currently half ass trying to get off of them, if nothing else I have brought my tolerance way down which for me is very awesome since I'm the type of junkie that uses non stop even if I'm already high. Anyway I've been there done most of that and hit rock bottom which is why I've been cutting way back.

My mom uses too, but she is one of those ppl that didn't start getting high till she was 40. She way over uses too and she didnt start getting high with easy stuff like weed she jumped straight to meth, or crack when she couldn't get meth. She was the one that finally talked me into trying meth and when i decided to quit using it she kinda got pissed at me and shut me out of her life for two years. She took using meth to the point where she didn't have power or water on at her house or food but she had her meth. Anyway she's been taking pills for years now and is starting to take her use to that bad place where your taking out loans and pawning shit to get more.

When I look back over the shit I've done to be able to get high i wish someone would have knocked some sense into my dumbass but i figure there was nothing that anyone could have said or did to keep me from using. I don't want to see my mom lose everything because of her habit and I don't want her to cut me out of her life but I can't see anyway to make her realize where she is headed if she doesn't get her shit straight now. She knows how much damage my use has caused me and my family but of course thinks it won't happen to her.

Is there anyway possible for me to talk to her about not screwing up her life without just making her mad? Also she knows I still use since she's brings me pills but knows I am using only a small fraction of what I was using so I know its hypocritical of me to tell her to stop using so much when I'm still using.

So I'm in Aus and worked out the potency of the heroin I get is pretty good, 15-25mg is enough for a begginer, 50mg for an experienced user and 100mg for a heavy nod for a tolerant user. 50mg IV is the equiv of 130mg of morphine IV and 100mg being about 250mg of morphine IV. 160mg of Oxycodone IV being equiv to 50mg Heroin IV. By potency this is the best H i've ever gotten btw and I'm lucky to have my H dealer get this stuff, wish Aus was cheaper though.

Remember to make sure you're comparing properly, for example the morphine/oxys I get don't gel in the spoon and soak well, I use 3mls with wheel filters and plenty of water to make sure I'm getting 99%~ of the drug in my pharm shots. If you say you're shooting 150mg of MSContin that gels in a single 1ml, well that's not really correct because morphine is only soluble to 60mg/ml.

Chasing all the needles

Chasing all the spoons

Chasing every dragon til I drown in his lagoon
Life's a fucking rocket

I'm the man in the moon

Always ever fiending 

From my pops, To her womb

Such a disappointment 

Like finding Jesus in the tomb

My reality's a fantasy

Like Alice and her shrooms

Take a bite of me
Taste my nectar it's so sweet 
While collectively 
Notourizing your defeat
First copping from the docs
Then copping from the street
Thoughts of suicide materialize
Wash, rinse, repeat

(This was a couple years ago, so memory is foggy, but I just remember looking forward to getting off the stuff.) I felt so foggy all the time, no euphoria or anything good, but it relieved the pain somewhat. As far as dosing, I took pretty much the prescribed dose and then a bit more, I do remember popping pills sorta like House MD. At the time I decided I didn't want to get into opiates recreationally, but I can't help but wonder if my state of mind was all kinds of fucked up from the other shit associated with getting your wisdom teeth out.  
  
So anyway, it was pretty much a terrible experience, I didn't want to take it again because of how it made me feel (the haziness, etc), but it did relieve the pain. I keep reading about how opiates can be like a fuzzy blanket for your soul or some shit, some euphoria and everything, and I didn't experience anything like that at the time, but that experience does sound very appealing.  
  
I do think I'm turned off from hydrocodone, thinking about trying oxycodone but I don't want to experience what I experienced before. I guess if anyone had any suggestions for the definitive opiate experience without being too crazy, that would be appreciated.  
  
One more thing, I'm perfectly happy with my weed, benzos, psychedelics, and occasional MDMA, so I don't have a burning desire to try opiates again.

We bought an ""E"" gel Opana today because money has been tight and getting the most bang for buck. She has only shot twice, ever in her life. I have done it quite a few times. So we melt it down and get one full shot ready for her, 1st shot of the day. She gets it and it instantly takes her to her knees. I start watching her because she starts worrying me. Her face starts to become insanely red, and her eyes bloodshot, her eyes then grow dark black rings around them. Then her face still stays red, but gets some sort of indention type things the size of match heads all over her face only but were not hives, not really sure what that was about. At that point, she was getting very nauseous she kept saying that she had to throw up, but before she could get to that; she fainted. I try slapping her face a few times, and she opens her eyes but is not responding. She also has lockjaw. A few friends, and myself attempt to get her in the car to take her to the hospital, but while comatose she is fighting us to get in the car, but not violently. We eventually get her in the car, and I slap her awake 2 more times, and manage to get something between her teeth to chew on. Also the entire time, that this episode is going on her breathing and pulse is normal, except for a couple times she makes that OD grunting noise when she 1st went down. She finally opened her eyes and kept them open for about 2-3 mins then opened the car door and got out without saying a word. Once she finally said something she sounded like ""David after Dentist"" and said, ""Is this real life? This feels like a dream"" So obviously very very delirious. She cannot walk on her own at this point. I take her inside, sit her on the couch, and she starts talking but not making a lick of sense. She just keeps repeating herself, and asking if she is dreaming. She knew who she was, me, but didn't know what day it was. So she sat there for about 5 minutes, and the more that she sat there the more she became aware till she was eventually back to normal, but not high at all. She has hives on her thighs, but no other remaining symptoms of the episode. The entire thing lasted about 12 minutes. 

I don't understand because we only do Opanas (the 15mg moons) one a piece, but all of the time snort them. I did the same amount she had done at the time this episode occurred, and went on to do 8-10 shots and nothing happened to me, but she couldn't handle one shot with the exact same tolerance? Also while in rehab the doctor told her that she had liver damage if that helps.",1378506532.0

So I started taking isotretinoin, sold as Accutane by Roche, about two months ago as acne treatment. I was instructed by my dermatologist to avoid drinking alcohol even though I have done it about 3 times after starting the treatment just fine but never went over 2/3 beers.

The only opiates I have tried in past were poppy tea and codeine but I didn't feel much of the effects with either of those. 
When I get back to uni I would like to give these wonderful substances a second try and it seems like oxycodone is a good opiate to start with. I am thinking of starting with 10 mg at first.

Anyways, my question is: opiates seem to be metabolized in the liver according to wikipedia and so is isotretinoin. How hard is oxycodone on the liver compared to alcohol for example?

I'm new here, and just have a quick question.

I'm not interested in pharmaceuticals or refined drugs, but I've been highly interested in PST for awhile (I don't even take OTC meds, but I'd like something to relieve headaches, help chill out, etc). I've done a lot of research, and the fact that there are any deaths at all has made me apprehensive (as compared to the coca I avidly chew). 

I know the amount of morphine widely varies between brands/kinds of seeds, and I am also aware that some of the deaths involved anxiety meds too. I strongly prefer to use plants, but I strangely think I'd feel more confident using prescription stuff because at least it's exact measurements. But I see many of you use PST, and I'd like to know how you minimize or eradicate risk.

Specifically - how do you PST drinkers measure your amounts? Is there any way to figure out how much active chemical is on the seeds? Is there some window of amount in which you will absolutely have effects but cannot od? And really, how do you so confidently drink mother earth's analgesic gift without wondering if someone's going to find you dead?",1378607846.0

Earlier today I went to pick up my daily bags. I always keep them in my mouth on the drive home, just in the case I get pulled over or something, so that I can quickly swallow them.

Well today when I got home, I spit the bags out- 2 of them were fine, as usual, but I noticed that the 3rd bag must have not been tied too tightly because some of my saliva had leaked into it and gotten the dope damp/kind of wet. I IV'd the 2 dry bags, and poured the 3rd (damp) bag into a spoon to air-dry... 

So my question is: I was wondering if the heroin that was dampened a bit by my spit will be safe to IV if I wait a few hours for it to dry, or if the possible risk of bacteria from my mouth/saliva is too high to potentially take this risk... any ideas, opinions or experiences?

I'm really hoping that I can still use this dope because I am going to need it to sleep tonight and don't have the money to pick up any more until tomorrow afternoon! Thanks!

I (28f) have been dating my boyfriend (26) for about 2 years now. His drug use (heroin) has been a big issue for most of it. I have been clean for a few years, but a couple of months ago we started using together. At first it was just going to be once, but I'm now using every day again. Our lives have pretty much become looking for money to reup, using, and then just sitting around until it's time to use again. 
I'm so depressed that I've been contemplating suicide. I'd like to stop, but there have been times when I've literally woken up to him putting a needle in my arm. I don't want to do this anymore... I love him but this relationship isn't a relationship anymore. In the past few months I've done things that I'd never thought I'd do. Horrible shitty things. We've pretty much bankrupt his parents. Granted I've used maybe a quarter that he has, but I'm still responsible for that. 

I've tried to talk to him about quitting and going on subs and getting jobs, but he's so against all of it. 

I have a kid, (not with me) and I want more for my life. I want my family back, I want to be normal. I want to be able to hold my head high again, and be proud of who I am. i love him, I don't want to leave him, but I'm finally realizing that he's pulling me down. 

Should I cut my losses, leave, and work on paying his family back? What do I do?",1378714946.0

Was a good day just picked up some good powder from the city. Was playing bags, eating, overall having a good time. Neighbor decides to bring out his unicycle. Im all for it. First few tries unsuccessful. And say this next time I'm going for it, gonna ride this unicycle. Make it a few pedals and fall back and attempt to step off. I step directly onto a rock and roll my ankle outwards. And all my weight goes onto it. Snap, crackle, pop. I hear and feel it break. Ohh shit I think. I lift it up and its like those YouTube vids were the ankle is hanging limp in the completely wrong direction. Go to the E.R. I have broken 2bones in my ankle on both inside and outside. Tibia and fibia I believe and also dislocated it. FUCK! I need surgery. Get sent home with 20 10mg hydros to last me 2 days. Go in for surgery Thursday that just passed. Got 9 pins on inside of my ankle and a plate with 8 pins on the outside. They shoot me up with dilaudid and send me on my way with some scripts. Have em filled I got 80 5mg rapid releases oxy and 20 10mg ops. That was Thursday its now Sunday night and almost all the 5mg are gone and have some ops left. Ops don't really help though. I wanna make a trip to the city soo badly and score some good h. Just so I can sleep and keep this pain under control. This is the worst pain I have felt. Worse then kidney stones, broken arm, wrist all combined. The bottle says take 1-3 5mg every 4 hours so thats up to 24 a day, I'm hoping the doc will write me something a little better this time. Sorry for the wall of text and rant  just going stir crazy here in this bed, can't sleep or shit. And I didn't include any of the B.S. of my newish job I'm out of work for for 8weeks min. I thinks that's enough, these 8 5mg I took are starting to help some. Be careful out there. Pain management can be an issue if you get hurt badly and have a habit.",1378710630.0

I got the needle in my vein, registered, but when I went to loosen the shoelace tied around my arm the needle slipped out of my hand and fell out of my arm! So what do I do with this blood filled rig? Leave it how it is and re-shoot it or is this shot ruined? Also, I've heard you will fuck up your veins if you don't loosen the tie off after you register, but will I fuck up my vein if I forgot to do that once and shot before i loosened up the shoelace?

I dont think benzos potentiate opiates, but they feel like they do. Cus you're just pretty much adding the benzo high to the opiate high.

So what do you use to potentiate your dope? & when do you dose it? & how? 


I want to know what the general consensus is for the most effective potentiation. 

Promethazine potentiates very well, but I can't get my hands on it. Same with clonidine, I hear.

I usually use benadry. 75mgs. - increase nod
Cimetidine (Tagamet) 600mg - makes duration of high last much longer; possibly increases nod/euphoria

So he pulls the curtain back and tells me to roll up my shorts so he can hit me in my quad. While he's doing this, he puts his hand on my crotch full on this time and like looks me in the eyes and smiles... This really pissed me off, so I decided to take advantage of the situation.

I threatened to reprt that he was trying to sexually harass me, and unless he gave me whatever vials he had in his pocket, I would do it. He was shocked, but knew that I was serious. So he gave me 2 vials of diazepam and a vial of lorazepam. I was kind of pissed that there was not dilaudid or morphine or some opiate...

Which made for slow moving, when we're walking to catch a taxi to get some needles from the vending machine, I ask if he got coke or meth, he says he got H and I was like 'oh man I thought you were getting coke/meth, you should get some of that' he says his coke guy is away for 3 days, but he can get meth, so he rings the guy and we catch a taxi up the road, meet the guy, then jump in another taxi to the needle vending machine. We get the needles and I'm talking to this ice dealer, who you would never think was an ice dealer, he seems pretty cool.

So then we all hop in a taxi back to the guys house. He gets 3 0.1g baggies of meth ($50ea). We get there and it's slow walking cuz hes constantly nodding out and also thought he lost his drugs for a while. We get back to his and after him nodding out while trying to prep, I eventually shoot like 30-40mg of meth with like 50mg of Heroin. The ice dealer leaves and says he will be back with food (never comes back while im there). The shot was pretty good, I grab a 20mg crystal of meth for later, and he gives me some money ($80). I ask for some more meth/heroin for later and he doesn't really answer, cuz he's so out of it I'm pretty sure, then says yeah ok but we gotta go now. He brings me a jim beam and cola and grabs himself a beer. He's rushing me and himself out of the house.

Once we get out I decline the drink, and he starts going on about how hes been ripped off by that other guy, he's looking around on the street where we were standing a bit, with a torch, and saying that he dropped something and his friend saw it and picked it up. Then he says he's going and that I should go as well, telling me to 'JUST GO, JUST LEAVE NOW', suddenly hes all mad I don't understand why the fuck he is, going on about being fucked over and ripped off. Even though I'm positive he wasn't fucked over. This is when he gives me the money because I say I need to get a needle from his house for later, he says just buy some, and I'm like what about the extra H/meth and he just gives me the cash and says 'JUST GO, LEAVE NOW'. I ask if he wants my number or if I can get his and just says 'NO JUST LEAVE'. I still don't understand why he was so angry at me at the end, I don't think I did anything wrong and up to that point he had been fairly nice.

Really weird, but quite a good night getting this shot, I go buy another point of H from my own dealer and get home at like 2am (shot with him was at 12am). Shooting my point of H and the rest of the meth in the same syringe. Still high now, grinding my teeth and smoking cigarettes. With money left over.

Was a good night. My only regret, is not getting the meth dealers number. I asked the guy shouting me, but he said no, should have asked the dealer tbh. I could have had way more in my shots as well, he said I could have as much as I could handle, but I didn't know potency of the H or Meth so went light the first shot, which afterwards he packed up all the stuff and that's when he rushed outside for seemingly no reason at 12am.

**tldr:** meet other random opiate user on street, start talking, he buys hundreds of dollars of H/meth and shouts me a shot, gives me money and meth for the road, then freaks out about something and we part ways.",1378756412.0

And what kind of person you are?,"I have been using for many years (mostly oxy, fent & heroin when I can find it) in a small town and being a user myself, have met a lot of other addicts/users. Sad to say I have never met one nice genuine other user. They all seam nice on the surface but later I always learn if you turn your back on them for even a second they wouldn't take a second thought about stealing from you or ripping you off. This inevitably has led me to go back to just hanging out with my truly genuine friends that smoke weed and I am a lone pill head among them. 

The reason this has me so curious is because most of the reddit users seam to be very nice people. So I don't really understand if it's just the people I have been coincidentally living around or the people of reddit just do not say everything. 

I guess I am wondering a few things specifically, I apologize for the very broad question so i'll try and clear that up. Do you guys/gals work for your money or ever steal in order to get your fix? Also how has being a user effected and changed what kind of person and how you act than how you used to before using?

I realize this sounds very stereotypical but I think I have almost lost fate because every user I meet seams to be a lying, thieving, douchebag. I just wish I had some good friends to nod the fuck out with and have a good ass time.",1378754745.0

Went home at the end of the shift, ate a bit, smoked, didn't do any more dope for the rest of the day but seemed to actually get higher, so much so that my vision started doubling and I started nodding out.  

Here's where it gets weird.  I wake up from a nap and try to eat dinner because I'd been eating like a Heroin addict all day, and at this point I started throwing up and sweating and getting sick, like I took too much dope.  Only I hadn't used in nearly 4 hours by this point.  

Tried to sleep but my sinuses and lungs were clogged all night, and when I woke up I threw up all my stomach acid this morning.

When I got home, I was a little pissed, because I felt like I had gotten ripped of in terms of dollar/mg. So I decided to crush one up and rail it. It burned, a lot, I won't lie, but I slowly and smoothly went up to a new state of high over the course of an hour.

Whether you take opiates by needles or pills! I suggest keeping the bullshit to a minimum! I'm sure some of you are up to here with people who mention different types of opiates that don't get you off like they used to. So what? If it's opiate related and they want to share it with you all then let it be so you don't have to be an asshole about it. 
If we all have one thing in common it's the high we feel when we take our drugs of choice. Some of us enjoy being a part of a community that others would frown upon. 

This place is for all sorts of opiate abusing individuals. 
Not just for Heroin or Opana users, why can't we all be equal?
If I only take hydrocodone and I see you in need of help while withdrawing on Heroin you better believe I'll be there for you! 
If I'm only taking pharmaceuticals and you shoot Heroin and share your stories with me you better believe I'll share with you! 
I'll never judge you on what type of opiate you enjoy or suffer from..

So please, if I post photos of what makes me feel as good as you do in your photos of needles and tar? Smile.. because that's what I do. Each and every one of your photos makes me feel good inside knowing you aren't suffering no more. Finally having that something to be proud of for the week. The sharing of scores always makes us happy.. doesn't it? 

Knowing that we all love each other just the way we are. Addicts or not. <3

Okay, so I made a post the other day saying that I had seen my doctor and that I told him that the pain in my leg wasn't getting better and that the Percocet 10/325 he was prescribing me only worked for about 3 hours before the pain would come back.  So he gives me another prescription for 120 Oxycodone Immediate Release 10mg (which I wasn't sure about initially because I couldn't read his handwriting).  So I have my normal script of 120 Percocet 10/325 and in response to the Percs not lasting long enough, he writes me another script for 120 Oxycodone Immediate Release 10mg.  

So he basically gave me the same script, except the new one he just gave me doesn't have the Tylenol in it.  So I've come to 3 conclusions as to why he wrote this:

1. He meant to give me extended release instead of immediate release.
2. He gave me the extra script so that I can take the Percocet 10/325 and then 3 hours later take the Oxycodone Immediate Release 10mg.  That way I'm dosing the Oxy every 3 hours but only getting one dose of the Tylenol.
3. He completely misunderstood what I was trying to tell him and wrote that script under some misunderstanding.

What do you guys think?  I was really leaning towards the first scenario but the more I think about it, the more I think #2 might be true.  Either way, I called him and he is supposed to call me back later on today.  I'll update when I talk to him.",1379001277.0

I see posts on this sub all the time showing $80 buns and what have you and all I can think is that is some bullshit. Like not saying it's not true it's just that my situation is so much worse.

I have two H connects in my town. One sells point bags for $40 and they usually weigh .08-.1. Cook up clean, shoot nicely. Off no tolerance 0.1 gives me 4 good shots. The other sells quarter gram bags for $80 that weigh ~.225 on average and are full of garbage. I'm newish to the dope game but I think it's a little bit of fent, a little bit of dope and a lot of shit. He calls it china white. It hits with a big rush, no legs to speak of and you're just kind of sick and sedate for 6 hours until you do another one.

So anyways bitching aside I'm just wondering how much better value the east coast sees than I do. For example when I see a listing for literally the best heroin in the world for ~350/gram I'm thinking that is prime. Dope that good I imagine would give me probably 6-8 shots/0.1g off no tolerance. And it weighs a full gram. None of this almost what I sold you shit. So people on the east coast, when you're picking up these buns for ludicrously cheap, what do they weigh out to when you pop em on the scale? How many good shots could you get out of 0.1g if you had just come off a good length tolerance break, ie had reset your tolerance? Does the ECP scene actually beat out the SR scene? Because I can't help but feel that ~$350/gram is a fair price for heroin that is actually pushing 60-70% purity and whenever I see people talking about their scores on the east coast I wonder how their value compares. 

Like for example let's say the best you can get off the road is like 65% and you're paying $350 for it, then in effect you are paying ~540/gram of pure heroin. ((350/65)*100) So then lets say you can get a bun in philly for 80 bucks that weighs out to 0.7 when you pop it on the scale and its 25% pure, then you got ~460/gram of pure heroin. So better value. But if that bun weighs in at 0.6 suddenly both grams cost 540. Drop the purity down to 20% and you're over 600/gram. I know it's pretty tough to just be like oh this is that % and this is that % but I look at it like if I haven't done opiates in a while 10mg of pure heroin IV would have me nodding for days and I kind of extrapolate from there.",1378995953.0

So my brother has been a recovering heroine/general drug addict for the past two years. My parents decided to send him back to college this semester so that he can finally graduate since he already had to take a semester off the first time we found out about the addiction. (i'm leaving out a ton of details but this isn't really the point of my post) 

Anyways, this morning my mom called me (i'm at college in another state) telling me they're going to Colorado to pick up my brother because he was in the hospital. Since I'm the younger sister I can never tell if my mom tells me the whole hearted truth or leaves things out. Regardless, i'm not naive and I could tell something was weird about the story. 
She said that his friend noticed he wasn't in class and since he's been really dedicated to school lately they thought it was weird. So they went to his apartment and he wouldn't answer the door. They finally called the police and the police broke in and my brother wasn't responding. 
When I said ""so he overdosed?"" my mom said no they just called the hospital because he wouldn't wake up when they tried to wake him up. And then she said that he had just taken a bunch of xanax so not to worry because it wasn't heroine. Also, she said he got released from the hospital after 2 hours after they had given him something (can't remember the name) 

SO essentially my questions are, I thought you couldn't overdose on xanax alone? So if my mom wasn't actually playing down the situation and he technically didn't overdose, is it possible to not be able to wake someone up when they're on xanax but it also not mean that they've overdosed? Also, if someone overdoses would they be let out only 2 hours after being admitted to the hospital? AND she said they're withdrawing him from school and admitting him to a 90 day program, which to me seems like a pretty big deal considering how much she down played what happened. 

maybe this also served as a little vent session, but I am seriously curious to hear opinions from people that may know more than I do about the drug world.

Been aware and reading this subreddit for a while now. Lots of you seem like good people so I was hoping someone might be able to give me some words of advice.

Backstory: I've been taking hydrocodone for maybe ~6 years now. Years ago I established an exact usage pattern, and never (literally never) strayed from it. One hydro (7.5mg), one beer, one bowl after work around ~6PM. Repeat at maybe ~9PM. I've always had a consistent supply and stockpiled.

Alas: all good things (??) must come to an end, and suddenly my supply has slowed greatly. Not to say ended, but I barely have enough for 1x a day and ran through reserves. I've managed to bring my schedule down to 1x a day for maybe 4x days now, but the cravings I get are insane. I've tried adding extra alcohol, a benzo before bed, it helps - but this situation is all I can think about during the day. It doesn't help I take daily adderall as well (have been since before hydro usage), I feel like I don't know what to do with myself or how to calm down in the evenings without the hydro/beer/bowl combo.

I've been seriously contemplating going on the hunt for a new source, but to be honest... I'm afraid. I've only had the one source for 5 years. I don't even know where to begin if I went down that route.

Anyway, I know there is a degree of physical addiction/withdrawal I'm dealing with, but I feel like the mental is soooo much worse. Does anyone have any tips for how to ease this process? I guess I would accept tips on how to find a new source, but I don't want that to become a thing. I just want a one-time big time re-supply so I can go back to my routine.

Need feedback.. I'm worried. Please help me out & ease my mind!","Hello r/opiates, I'm a very frequent lurker and occasional poster & commenter here under a different username. I made a throwaway (obviously) as not to reveal my identity to people I know in the real world who may or may not recognize me here based off of information in this post. I love this community, you all are real down-to-earth genuine people and I need your guys' reassurance here, and possibly advice. 


I apologize in advance for the possibly lengthy wall of text. Here goes.


So a little background information. My boyfriend and I are IV heroin users, and around our area only tar is available to us. We had a fairly large pickup today, mostly for personal use, but we're going to sell enough to make our money back at the very least. 


Anyway, today the batch we picked up was some pretty excellent product. We can't afford to pick up very often, so maybe twice a month around $250-$500, if we're lucky. And of course, on days we pick up we can't help but to binge a little bit and enjoy getting super low. I'm sure most of you can relate to going a little bit overboard on days such as this. 


We both have about .1g to .5g a day habits, at the most, as we pay a ridiculous price for .1g balloons locally (unless we go out of state to pick up, as we did today). So in our excitement we probably used about .10g total in a matter of maybe six hours.


My boyfriend normally vomits once or twice after any shot, he has a sensitive stomach when it comes to the rush I suppose. But tonight he was violently vomiting AT LEAST twenty times, I'm not exaggerating when I say it could be more than that. So I started to worry, when a shot of pepto didn't work (he threw it up), then alka-seltzer (couldn't keep it down), and finally he took a couple of zofran, which seems to be finally quelling his extreme nausea. 


All night since we got home, I've been concerned that he probably overdid it tonight and possibly OD'd or a mild version of one. He was nodding out so hard, I've never seen him like that. Wasn't at all coherent, couldn't answer any questions, couldn't keep his eyes open, etc etc. He never nods that hard. So that worried me, but he seemed to be okay and we decided to go to bed. 


I made him promise me that he would sleep on his side, just in case he vomited in his sleep. He fell asleep on his back, and I had a hell of a time waking him up to roll him on his side - I had to slap him a few times pretty hard and yell his name. He finally did fall asleep on his side, but me being a worried girlfriend, I couldn't quite pass out myself. That's when I noticed he was on his back again, and he started very violently gasping - huge, deep gasps, not at all healthy or normal sounding. 


I panicked and started shaking him, yelling at him to wake up, and I had to smack him in the face and stomach really hard, and yell right in his face in order to get him to open his eyes. He was cold to the touch and his lips had no color in them, not to mention his eyes are pinned way more than normal. I made him promise to stay awake with me for however long it takes for him to feel normal, so, here we are, laying in bed on my computer, lights on in the bedroom, a movie playing, everything to try and keep him awake. I have him drinking water, because vomiting so much no doubt made him dehydrated. And every two minutes or so I shove him and make him open his eyes - he's nodding pretty hard still.


I have never been so fucking scared in my life, I love this man and cannot lose him. I was so close to calling an ambulance - I'm sure a lot of you would say that's what I should have done, but we just cannot afford any medical bills, both being broke college students, and more importantly, we can't have either of our families know we're using again. 


If any of you have made it this far, THANK YOU for reading, I really do appreciate it. Does anyone have any advice for me, other than to keep doing what I'm doing (keeping him awake, feeding him water)?
This is definitely a wake up call to be a little (or a lot) more careful with dosing in the past. Neither of us are novices by any means, but no matter how long you've been using, I suppose we got a little bit careless.


**TL;DR** My boyfriend probably used a little too much tonight (IV heroin, black tar), he vomited very violently all night, started gasping heavily in his sleep, and now I'm keeping him awake and feeding him water, any further advice?",1379073648.0
1mb3pk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1mb3pk/some_low_points/,4,https://redd.it/1mb3pk,tears4brd,Some low points?,"Tonight was a pretty dumb low on my part. So, I'm not physically addicted anymore right now. I don't feel 100%, but I feel pretty fine and I have not done dope for about 5 days until tonight. So, I go and pick up and decide I'm going to bang my entire amount since I don't wanna save any for tomorrow. Plus, I don't wanna do it again for a nice long while.


 Anywho, I forgot water and I changed cars downtown to switch into my friends car. After I pick up were going to kroger since they're open 24/7. Damn store was closed for some god damn reason w/e. So, it had just rained and I was determined. I had a back-cap to my friends rig and told him that if it drew up w/o clogging w/ no colour then were banging puddle water.


 Sure enough it was actually almost 100% clear. I also had .5ml rigs and not 1ml rigs. If you're not familiar back caps hold almost exactly 1ml of water give or take a little bit depending on surface tension or what now. The most I've ever gotten is ~1.15ml and thats fine if you're going to cook w/e it is or split with some one.


 Anywho, I'm shooting china. My area is pretty cool in the fact that it has black tar and china. The china that I am getting is the best dope in my area by a super long shot. Everyone agrees that its way better than most the shit around heere and its better than  the silk-road dope I tried once. So, really awesome shit. Splitting 100mg will make both people nod out really hard.

 So, I do a 220mg shot of the best china I can find cooked up with puddle water! Such high class shit. I get it first try and I actually rushed my balls off. I have not gotten a rush in some time, but I suppose doing a lot of some really good shit solves that problem. At the same time... using puddle water to do a shot. Yeah, that is kind of fucked up to say the least. 

 I'm not proud of it. ESP, considering I'm not even sick anymore. Like. what the fuck? Guess that junkie mentalisty kicks over. I just hope I can continue to stay clean. My kind of gf-esq best friend and I are going to be moving downtown in a 1bedroom. It is super reasonable too. All of our bills (rent w/water and trash combo, electricity, and internet) will be around 600 every month which is not bad at alllll. 

 I'm going to be making around 500-700 a week depending on my luck. She will be making about 250-400 every shift working at this cool strip club in town (I've never been as I'm not interested in going, but I've been told it is a cool place or w/e). So, that is at least 1k/week on a bad week. 


 Were just talking and we can't get strung out this time. We could afford it; sure, but it would suck to lose *all* that money to just scrape by. I'm rambling worse than before now and for that I'm sorry. 
Were both excited to stack money so I think we will be able to do it. I'm not saying we won't use, but if it becomes an issue we can just buy subs.

**TL;DR** Been clean for 5 days. Not sick anymore. Did a 220mg shot of the best china in my area that is better than the SR shit I ordered. Awesome rush. Did use puddle-water for the shot though which is a kind of low point. Then I ramble about getting a new place, but thats after rambling about getting high.




Bleh, w/e. I fucking enjoy the movie.

The point is that I use because of this. If you're depressed and thinking about using, please don't. It will only make your depression worse. If you just started using, quit now. I get high and then think about life and how I have nothing. I have tried committing suicide using heroin. Getting high only makes your problems worse.

1maoo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/1maoo6/lucky_od/,7,https://redd.it/1maoo6,see_thru_faded,Lucky OD,"So today started out like most good days, was able to stop by the block on the way to work and grab a little .1, had a needle on me so I was looking forward to fixing up in the work bathroom and breezing the day away with a cool buzz.

I work in the administrative section of a hospital btw, remember that because its kind of important.

Being a solitary drug user Ive gotten pretty good at not shooting an amount that will kill me, especially somewhere I'm expected to keep up appearances, and had no reservations about slamming just .1. ESPECIALLY because I had just had dudes dope earlier in the week, wasnt anything hot, and it was a pretty skimp ass point at that. So i mix the dope and the water, and my first clue that i was about to monumentally fuck up my day was the odd rockish white pieces that kind of stood out among the fluffy powder. Observing that odd little detail was not enough to go easy and sacrifice the minimal rush I was expecting from the bag, so i tapped a vein and shot it all home at once.

Pretty much as soon as I shot it, I had a feeling that maybe I should get the fuck out of the locked bathroom, just in case. Sure enough I make it as far as the front lobby before I fell the fuck out, started convulsing on the sidewalk, in front of a few of my (former) coworkers, causing a pretty sizable scene. 

Of course thats just what the paramedics told me, I remember nothing after staggering out of the bathroom and getting on the elevator. Of all places to OD though, and especially of all work places, I picked the right one because I was told that before the ambulance even made it to me (which already didnt take long because i work at a fucking hospital) I was surrounded by nurses and a few Docs administering valium to stop the seizing and giving me CPR. 

Even so, the medics said i was pretty blue when they got there and was about as close to death as someone who overdoses on hospital premises can be. Im still not sure what the hell was in that bag to render roughly .06 *maybe* a deadly dose. either everyone all the way up the line forgot to add a cut, or it was cut with something like fentanyl. but jesus i cant really overstate how fucked the whole situation was. So while it was lucky, (read im not dead) holy shit it was about as bad as i could imagine an OD going",1379045987.0

Funny how we all torture ourselves looking at pictures of pills/dope when we are sick and should be preoccupying our minds with *literally* anything else. Anyways, it has been a hell of a week. Ever since moving a few weeks ago and lifting all that heavy furniture and shit you have to lift when you move, my back has been killing me and getting severely worse every day. I feel like I should be walking with a cane and I'm young(ish). So my dad made me a chiro appointment and I went today and find out I have sciatica and I'm telling you the pain is the worst. And to top it off this guy doesn't prescribe meds (never been to a chiropractor before) and all he did was an adjustment that made everything feel worse. Then I had a math test today that I think I did pretty shitty on and when I get back to my car from class I have a damn parking ticket. AND with recently quitting my job before I moved I never have any money. My dad sometimes throws me a few bucks but it usually goes towards things I need like gas and food/ cigarettes. And I can't ask him too much because he wonders why I blow through money so fast. So I get home from school, opi-raging to myself the whole way, check the mail and BOOM! a $50 check I forgot I had coming is in there! So I quickly hit up my boy, cash the check and pick up a pack of smokes and 4 bags of fire dope. It's not much, but here we are moments after my first hit on the former crappiest Friday ever and I couldn't be more pleased. I hope all my friends here have similar turn-arounds soon if they are down on their luck. I know I have been for a while but I'm a good person and my luck will change I just know it. Stay safe brothers and sisters! Hope your weekend is great!

However, just as a reminder, there are a few things that we must be conscious of pertaining to opiate use.

First, we all have to be safe! If you shoot up dope, always do a small test shot of new stuff in order to evaluate it's potency to be sure we don't overdose. Also, always use clean materials, and be sure to boil your shot for a sufficient amount of time (especially if you are using BTH). Don't share needles, but if you must, attempt to clean them out as best as possible: Soak your rig in bleach for about 20min's prior to use, and then flush extensively with water before prepping your shot. (Alcohol does NOT kill HIV, only bleach does).

Next, addiction has bad consequences, but something that is much worse is a felony. Always be cautious about buying/selling, and where you are using. If addicted, we can always get clean and go back to living a normal, happy life. But if you get caught it can follow you for the rest of your days, especially in terms of employment, or pursuing a career.

Lastly, we have to acknowledge that when we plunge into the depths of addiction it hurts the people around us. Family, friends, coworkers, they all can be hurt by our addiction. At the very least, try to be a decent human being and not steal from people that trust us.

Just a reminder. Otherwise, all you bropiates have fun! happy nodding!

TLDR; Be safe, don't overdose, clean your shit, don't get caught, know that your habit hurts more than just you, be responsible, and have fun!",1379226021.0

I guess the title of the post says it all. I found a small stash of my sister's (who I live with) hydrocodone pills and took all 6 of them without thinking because I was pretty sick. Its very clear that she has gone through great lengths to hide them from me as they are in a different bottle, hidden in an old coat in the back of her closet, so I can assume that she is at least somewhat aware of their presence. She thinks I am clean and sober now and if she finds out I took them, it will be a huge thing and I will probably get kicked out and burn the last bridge I have. Is there anything I can slip in there that might pass at a glace for them, just to buy me some time until I can score some more? Any help would be appreciated, I'm freaking out.

edit: I had two left and put them back in the bottle and put the bottle back. I am hoping that she doesn't need them any time soon and if she does, I will just deny, deny, deny. That is, unless I decide to be honest, which is usually what I end up doing if I am caught.

It was a relatively big shot and the dope is super high quality. I know everyone says that but it is and please take that as a fact if and when you share your thoughts.

I found a vein in my forearm and I went in but quickly decided to use the crook of my arm, the most famous vein, so I inserted the needle once again. I got a be autiful plume of dark ruby red rum when I pulled back so I was off to the races at once.

This is where things took a turn. I got a stange sensation and then extreme pins and needles in BOTH hands. My heart was beating hard and fast. The pins and needles in my hand became very painful. I was kind of freaked  out. Did I hit an artery? I was using short point needles in an easy to hit spot, fresh needle, and I have been shooting this dope for 5 days now with no issues.

Any thoughts on what may have caused this? I didn't really get that  much of a rush or if I did it was noticed due to all the pain in my hands!

I felt better within minutes but I feel like I'm not as high as I should be.

Well, like the evil mistress that opiates are, I found myself climbing up to a maximum dose of nearly **300mgs** of hydrocodone throughout the course of a day. It was then I realized that this drug was taking over my life, and that I need to slow down.

So here's my question(s): I have the drugs at my disposal to taper down with. I've already tapered myself down to a steady 30mg every 8 hours or so with mild withdrawal symptoms and the infamous restless leg torture. Should I continue my tapering method of 30mg every 8 hours, and slowly decrease my intake by 5mg every few days? Or should I just stop with the hydrocodone and use the Subs I still have to kick my habit? I would honestly like to take the path that's going to give me the least/easiest withdrawal effects. Also I still have no idea how to gauge how often to dose the suboxone. Any and all help and advice would be truly appreciated!

Don't you love it when they have you rush to meet them, you haul ass to get there, and here comes the text, ""post up, 25 mins."" which usually turns into an hour, then two... Urgh. My sexy middleman and I are alternating turns running to the Applebees restroom and snooting some grade A tweak I got earlier. He did all the shit I gave him. I'm in the handicap stall taking a bump. I'm smert. I'm saving the rest until Mr. DBoy gets here with my tar then going home and going on a Mexican Speedball Odyssey. Haha. He should be here soon, or so he says. We all know how dope time works.











As for the bullshit, yesterday I literally waited six hours on some supposed dank as fuck gunpowder. Shit finally gets there and cute middleman says, 'Dont worry about breaking me off, it feels a lil skimp.' I open it up. I have to unwrap a water balloon, a foil ball, then finally a piece of grocery bag it was wrapped in.... I waited six goddamn motherfuckin hours and paid $80.... Only to unwrap a FUCKING DIME!!!! This dude was suggested to us by another user and was supposed to be legit. I mean, the dope was fire. Half a point had me jacked and usually i need about .3 to get me going. That was not fun at all. I trust my middleman and don't doubt for a second that scumfuck dboy took most of it and sold me some bullshit skimp ass sack. Oh well. In this game, this horrible, lovely game I've played for nearly 1/4 of my life, i have come to accept that you'll get burned sometimes.








And as i was making my hustle today, i met a DOWN ass dude ... I was gonna hustle him but he just turned out way too rad. Took me to lunch, gave me $80 after i fed him a sob story about my phone being shut off soon, gave me $40 worth of shit for free to take home, bought me a pookie and get this shit.... I should've been offended but I wasn't. Basically in a much nicer way he told me I look like a raggedy ass byatch... So homeboy took me to fuckin Nordstroms and bought me a $200 pair of heels ($150 on sale) and a $100 dress haha. He's also taking me to Universal Studios Friday and told me he'd buy me whatever I want... Drugs, clothes, trips, he even offered to pay my rent if I wanted to move out of my parents, and even to buy me a fuckin car and let me drive his Beemer til then. He just wants me to be his girl. I am sorely tempted lol dude is loaded.












I have one more story to share but it has to wait till I get home. Thanks for reading all that if you did and stay tuned for more :D










EDIT: IDK why I put the Smiley face next to me saying I still had another story to tell... it was more q dumb ass move. Even though it felt a fuckin mazing, it was pure dumbfuckery on my part. I have always been warned/ known about the dangers of mixing benzos and smack but lets be honest...  if you've ever had dope and Valium, damn straight you're gonna use benzos to enhance that dope high. But I uh, went a little overboard. 










So I kind of ate 6 5mg Valiums and had a good size shot of tar. I didn't fall out, but I was nodding uncontrollably and unfortunately my family definitely noticed. So I go up to sleep it off upstairs in my bros bedroom (my downstairs bedroom stays fuckin death valley hot no matter what I do) and understandably, my mom comes to check up on me since I had been so fucked up. She said I was very very short of breath and had a weak pulse, so my mom and brother stayed up watching me all night so I didn't stop breathing. That made me feel pretty shitty to have put them through that. :/ hey, but no worries! No benzos for me. Ma raided my room that night and I guess I left literally all my shit on my ""dope desk"" as I call it. Paraphernalia.... spoon, pile of cottons, my morning shot sitting there in cellophane, a rig, a tie.... God I'm a dumbass. That has never happened to me. I'm always very meticulous about stashing my shit, and I could have swore I did, but obviously not.  She also took my bipolar meds, my ambien,  and the few Valium I had left. 









 
Her and I got into it in the morning, me yelling about her digging through my room (before I found out it was in plain view lol) and taking my shit, her about me being that shithoused in front of the entire family. She was equally pissed as to the fact that i only got my valium script 3 days ago and there were six left out of 30.... erm, oops.  :x we came to a civil agreement that she is to dispense my pills and I'm good with that. She was even kind enough togive me back my dope relates things, including my morning shot, which blew me the fuck away. Hell yeah for awesome moms.




















And also, fuck chyeah, I'm getting more ink! I'm going to have my middleman blast me up. I'm getting wolf pawprints with either ""Born Free"" or ""Run Ahead of the Pack "" in cursive near it.  Gonna sketch it soon after I take another shot of this divine tar I picked up earlier.









Also, two things I'll leave up to y'all (well maybe the first but for sure on the 2nd) is that I'd like votes on which tat quote y'all like better, and if I should post a pic of me in the dress and heels, even though its notopiate related. Just so y'all can sew how cute they are :D",1379307223.0

The doctor forced me to take the sub too soon and I went into precipitated withdrawal. It was the worst night of my life. However, I only felt bad for 12 hours and then felt fine. If I would have not taken another opiate after that would I have been fine? I ask because I know it was the suboxone that kicked the opiates out of my system and not narcan. Was curious if I could just shoot up some narcan, have a terrible night, and be done with this. 

Edit: Am I the only person in the world that has never had ANY symptom besides SUPER BAD RLS when withdrawing? Even in precipitated withdrawal I never puked once or had any stomach issues. When I was doing dope it was the same thing. I would end up in full withdrawal with only RLS to the point where I wanted to die. I would trade that symptom for every other symptom times 10.

Call me Big Feet Daddy Kane.  Big Feet Daddy Kane.""  I smirked at him as I walked by, he probably didn't notice though.  

A few minutes later I rang him up at the front of the store and both he and one of the women he was with were wearing Ol' Dirty Bastard t-shirts.  I said 'Is it ODB's birthday or something?'

Then the woman says she's ODB's wife.  The guy was his son, named Li'l Dirty Bastard, and they stopped by the store because he just did a set and threw his sneakers into the crowd.  Made me laugh.  

I told the ladies working the front desk who they were and this black lady I work with got all excited and took some pictures with him.  lol, she just abandoned her customer at the register to go talk to him.

So I was high watching the football game at the bar last night making conversation with the owners when they mentioned getting some live music in there in the near future. I told them that I'm sort of a one-man band and said I play blues/folk/rock and they said they are very interested and that I should bring them a demo of my music for them to listen to, as well as play a few songs for them in person.

So this Wednesday I get to show off my talents to these guys and hopefully get to be a regular act at the bar, which has always been my dream ever since I started playing. I've been in many bands and they always end up being drama queens, besides my style of playing is much better if it's just me playing and singing, maybe some light drumming and bass. I know I'm rambling but I'm just so excited you guys! Now I'm just trying to figure out what songs to bust out for the audition so I can really impress them. I don't even care what they pay me as long as it's something to get dope with, I don't really have any bills now since my dad took them all over when I moved in with him. 

Also I just did a nice fat shot for inspirational purposes. Any thoughts on what to play for these people? I've already got a nice list and I'm sure I don't have much time to play, so I was thinking something by Sublime like What I Got, maybe Peaceful Easy Feeling (the Eagles), Ho Hey (the Lumineers), Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground (White Stripes), O Dusty (Kings of Leon) Night Moves (Bob Seger) Meet Me in the City (Black Keys) Cherub Rock (Smashing Pumpkins). I have plenty more covers and some originals but I think stuff like this is what they will want me to play since they're mostly songs that everybody knows and I do good versions of all of these songs. I figure I'll just start playing the songs from this list till they tell me to stop.",1379419316.0

Long time listener first time caller. Bit of background because I think I use opiates a bit different than most (for now anyway)

Started about 10 years ago snorting 3 tab 5s and getting wasted. Obviously that moved up to Oxy. I rode the oxycontin express til the wheels fell off. I was a full blown junkie for about a year and a half. Selling my stuff from FL and reupping locally. Got real bad because ""hey it's practically free to me"" When the fun down south stopped I reevaluated things and quit for about 9 months. After that I still had one of the best connects around so would make runs for Opanas for people and make some quick cash and a free pill or line or whatever. Well my connect got locked up so that stopped but I still liked getting high every so often. 

So here's my question to other chippers. Do you have a set schedule like every other pay day? Any rules like not getting high consecutive days? Is there something that sets you off and makes you go get high that day? I have a decent job and could afford to get high more often and have connects too. I know it's hard for must people, IME, to chip without slipping back into bring a full blown junky. It's a slippery slope and know I'm not immune. Been doing it for about 3 years this way and have had to check myself a couple times. I would just like to hear from other chippers.

I started off with just hydrocodone at age 19, then found myself doing obscene amounts of H or oxy a day by age 22.  I hit a low point when I was snorting (never shot up, thank goodness for small miracles, right?) upwards of 1g a day, but I managed to distance myself from the scene before it escalated beyond that.  I moved to another apartment and took a week to go through w/ds, which wasn't completely unbearable because I had a fistful of colonzepam to get me through it.  

I was off of opiates completely for a few months before I came upon a reliable connect for 10mg norcos, and soon found myself back in an addiction cycle.  This continued until about 7 months ago, but it never reached the levels it had in the past.  Then there was a HUGE fallout with the connect, who was also a very close friend of mine.  Still pisses me off to think about it to this day...it had nothing to do with drugs (not right away, at least), but all you really need to know was that he accused me of something heinous that wasn't true at all, then proceeded to talk shit to anyone that would listen after I rightfully tried to defend myself.  With all that happened, I was cut off from a lot of connects (weed mostly) and a large portion of my social circle.  

I went through some pretty shitty w/ds after all that, and never found another established opiate connection.  I still craved 'em like a motherfucker, but at the over time, I came to see the silver lining in this awful situation.  I may have had my ties severed with people I considered as good as family, but I realized how unforgivably awful my friend's attitude and accusations had been.  In addition to the first thing he accused me of, he then singled me out as a thief that had been stealing his mother's painkillers!  With like, not even a fucking shred of evidence or logic to support the claim.  He basically blamed me for anything that he couldn't immediately explain going missing in his house, and then painted me as a villain to all of our other friends before I could object.  I realized how incredibly petty this was, and that being away from that environment and easy access to opiates could only be a good thing for me.

So here we are today.  I turned 25 last month, and was hoping to celebrate with a little opiate treat, but I couldn't find any.  By sheer dumb luck, however, I managed to get five 10mg norcos the other day.  I remember when 50mg wouldn't do anything but alleviate w/ds.  This time, I got high as Hell just taking 30mg, as high as I would get nearly six years ago.  Took the other 20mg a couple hours ago and felt like a champion still.  I had thought for so long that I would never be able to come back to this level, but it pleases me to know that I don't have to take obscene amounts of opiates to catch a buzz anymore.  And I know that this wouldn't be possible if I had a regular connect.  

I get the feeling that the urges are always going to be there, but I'm finally at a point in my life where I think I can control them, and enjoy the occasional PK high here or there to keep myself from going insane.  The trials that I went through during my main addict phase are some hard lessons I don't want to forget.  For better or worse, they played a big part in forming me into the person I am today.  that being said, I also can't deny the siren call of opiates every now and then.  I hope I don't fall down the path of total addiction again, but I just don't see how it's possible under current circumstances...I think I can indulge a little bit here or there.

Started of with the Roxie's until I got hip to the brown. Used to just sniff it, but then I realized my grandmother had diabetes, and that that meant syringes. I asked a friend who I knew shot to show me the ropes and then I was on my way. When I first shot it was the most amazing rush if ever experienced. It was a rush of warmth and pure emotion wanting to poor out of me that I know all to well now. I would never sniff that shit agin, why waste it? Three years ago I did it every day for a week straight, but after that week I felt like SHIT, like I needed that shit to complete my happiness. It was the weakest feeling I've ever felt. I made a promise to myself that day that I would never have that horrible feeling that my happiness was being controlled by a fucking drug. I continued to use, and use a lot(I had really rich friends who shared A Lot, until they fell off..) but I made sure I spaced that shit out, and when ever I felt the pull I stopped for a week or so then started back. I've never been sick or had any WDs since three years ago, unless you count those sweaty sleepless nights after you got stupid high too close to bedtime lol. I love this shit, no other high can touch it. When I'm on it I just gush with emotion and pour out love, sometimes alittle too much lol. I've continued using since three years ago but like this, il use  for three days, then stop for a week, use one day, stop for two, use five days, stop for a month,and then repeat a cycle similar to this.

I have cycled between a few different opioids lately but my suboxone seems to leave me feeling the worst the next morning unless I dose before bed. This doesn't make sense to me why I am withdrawing early. With the long half life of suboxone, the w/d symptoms shouldn't kick in until after 24 hrs I thought. The last time I took it was yesterday around 3:00 pm, I took 1mg (I have a lower tolerance than most as I am just now transitioning from chipping to using). 15 hrs later I wake up feeling god aweful.

In addition, it seems that 1 mg suboxone did very little to help with withdrawal symptoms this morning, although that is my usual dose. I wouldn't have expected to build such a large tolerance so quick that I would still be in w/d after my normal dose. Maybe the problem is route of administration. Sublingual is not an option as I have puked several times just because of the strips being in my mouth. I was cutting up into little pieces and snorting the film followed by snorting a few water drops to help dissolve. This worked surprisingly well, but my nose is usually stopped up in the morning. Thus my only option has been to plug my dose (hey don't judge me). I do have diarhea in the mornings, so I can only dose after my morning shit, however, I suppose anything left behind could hinder absorption. Anyways I hate suboxone and would prefer anything else. I think the long duration of sub is actually the reason I finally became a full blown, physically addicted addict.

Help.,"My friend is 20 years old, she is 4'10. Very small, BUT she's been using a needle for quite awhile. I do not, but my boyfriend and I were both with her while she did it tonight. But something crazy happened, and I want to know what it is called, and also, what happened to her? What was going on in her body and head?
Here's the story, sorry if it doesn't make complete sense, I am still very freaked out.. -

After she bangs, she comes out to the living room (skipping, so yes happy) and sits down on the couch. The couch has a leg rest that comes out of it so she was in an awkward position. 
Fairly quickly she entered a 'deep sleep' (I'm not even sure if it was a sleep but she was not in our reality) and started making odd noises or something. My boyfriend looks over and asked if she was alright and RIGHT then she makes a way louder noise and started to look faint. I walk over to her and start asking her if she's alright, no response. Yes, I'm scared, freaking out inside, but staying calm on the outside. After awhile her lips start turning purple and her face pale (she is a tan girl, tanning booths got the best of her). I can't think of anything to do, her body is completely stiff. I see her knuckles are clenched (she shoots on the tops of her hands because they are the only veins she can use without fucking up).
So as her knuckles are so clenched I go over and grab her head to move it a little and her eyes roll straight back into her head...
now normally this would scare me but her heart was beating just fine. 
Then I pour cold water over her, and she twitched.. that wasn't enough for me. This is my best friend, I want her awake and talking NOW. 
So my boyfriend picks her up for me and we get her to her bed, just about to go upstairs and wake up her mom, just about to go call 911 and probably get into a lot of trouble... 
Now my friend is seriously so stiff that her neck isn't even resting on anything, it was honestly disgusting for me to see.
She starts opening her eyes, but they are straight OPEN, No blinking or moving... just a blank stare, not at me, or anyone. She's OUT. I start talking to her, and after awhile I grab her face and stare into it and say her name, can you hear me... FINALLY I get a nod. I tell her I lover her, and she nods, I ask if she can see me, (eyes still wide open looking at nothing) she says no. Then she starts to slowly come through, started with releasing her grip she had on her hands, her legs start to rest, her neck lays back down, and starts to get her eyes going. Then BAM completely snaps out of it, she's back to normal (still kind of nodding, but the kind I recognize) My boyfriend starts telling her exactly what happened as I'm bawling my eyes out happy as fuck I didn't have a dead friend, or didn't have to call 911. 
In my town 911 would turn into whoever that was there goes to jail... because some how it would be our fault a friend or whoever shot themselves up and died or over dosed. Yeah, so you could see why I was scared. Plus, dealing with my best friend like that was horrible to watch. I'm still shaky from it you guys. 

Note: yes we know how small she is, and she does to. She NEVER does as much as a normal sized person does. She's actually extremely careful. She also is not an addict, she does do it a lot, but not every day. & she never withdrawals or anything. 

OK, I'm emotional, so try to explain it nicely. I know most of you are pretty chill so I'm not too worried. I just want 
-advice (on what to say to her, and how to tell her that I'm scared of her to keep doing that, what if it happens worse next time?)
-what happened? Can you explain what went on inside her brain? Or her body? 
-Have you experienced anything similar? PLEASE STORIES WOULD BE GREAT. I would love to here about it. 
-Was this an OD? 
-What could I have done different? Is there anyway I could have made it better? What did you guys do?


Thanks for taking the time to read this, you guys rock, seriously. 
Have a great night, I'm going to go cuddle with my completely nodded best friend and celebrate the fact that she is alive and so beautiful. <3 Goodnight.",1379491326.0

Since I won't be doing anything but staying in bed and recuperating, and music always enhances the fuck out of my opiate highs, my question is what are your suggestions for music to chill to when I'm at that ""do nothing and nod out"" stage?

I know injecting is over 3x more potent than the normal method which is why I am taking the TINIEST little slivers). will this process eventually lower the amount of opiates in my system and make my withdrawal easier? Or should I just flush what I have left. In theory (my theory) using those micro amounts over time will be like a little taper. I am not even taking enough to feel better, just not as worse.

I was making good money (>4k a month with little to no living expenses) and it eventually got to the point where I just couldn't afford to get high anymore. I was paying $18/roxi 30 and had a store I could walk in and cop from 6 days a week. I never touched H, not that I wouldn't it just wasn't available.

Need some input, please.","Hey everyone, throwaway for privacy reasons. Anyways on the point, I like opiates just like most of you, but the availability and price are the main issue. I don't have much opiate experience except for a handful of 10mg hydrocodones I may come across every couple of months which I blow in about 2 weekends. I have a job and full health coverage, but I can't put that to use because I have no legitimate reason for being prescribed an opiate. 


I want to try powder heroin to SMOKE (vaporize?), I really don't want to snort and definitely not IV. I see that heroin #4 is about $20 a stamp of about 120mgs on the SRoad. 

I will say that 40mg of hydro gets me good and I only indulge on weekends (when I have some) because I have other responsibilities during the week. That being said, how many milligrams of H would it take, I know purity counts here, to get me to a good state? Last time I had hydrocoddone was about a month ago, and before that it was at least 3 months so my tolerance is on the lower side of things, I assume.

I'm actually trying to vaporize it out of my Arizer Solo vaporizer if you guys know what that is. 

Here's a link to the product:
http://www.vapeworld.com/arizer-solo-vaporizer

Basically I was thinking of sandwiching a bit between some weed in the vaporizer OR ball some up in a cotton (like you were preparing to IV) ball and stick it into the Solo's glass stem and vaporize. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are the temperatures that the Solo supports if it's of any value:

Temp Level 1: 50° C / 122° F
Temp Level 2: 185° C / 365° F
Temp Level 3: 190° C / 374° F
Temp Level 4: 195° C / 383° F
Temp Level 5: 200° C / 392° F
Temp Level 6: 205° C / 401° F
Temp Level 7: 210° C / 410° F
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyways, can this be done? Please save me the ""please don't try H, it will ruin your life"", I am aware, but I have made up my mind and I will eventually try it sooner or later. 

With me having zero/low tolerance will this be an issue? I presume it will, but will vaporizing 5-10mgs be an issue? That seems like a standard dose for a noob. Thanks everyone, if I forgot to include something then I'll try to add it. Will trying H provide a cross-tolerance to other pill form opiate drugs such as oxycontin, hydrocodone, and others I haven't tried?

I've just started seeing this guy at my college, and nothing is very serious but it got me wondering. How do you go about telling someone that you abuse opiates?

It's difficult to know if I should even tell him. For now, I'm obviously going to keep my mouth shut. But at what time does it become a better decision to let them know? And how do you break the news? This is all new to me. I never really thought I'd be in this position. Any advice on the subject would be welcomed since I trust your input, /r/opiates :)

Have a great night everyone

**EDIT:** Thanks for your help everyone! I'm going to tell him tomorrow night. I'll update as soon as I can. I'm not sure what I'll say yet, but I suppose I just have to be straight with him. It's nerve wracking as well because he's very good friends with all of my roommates and none of them know about my using. This conversation may make my life a lot harder than it has been, but ah well. Hey, don't they say it's always best to give someone bad news right after sex? Ha, just kidding. Maybe. 

**EDIT 2:** Oh man, I think he's a keeper. It was difficult to bring it up but once I got started I felt better for telling him. He was very understanding. He said that we're all human and we all have vices, his being alcohol. He didn't mention me quitting and I don't think he's going to try and convince me to. He said he wanted me to practice the utmost caution as it is very dangerous and he would hate himself for knowing about my use and not doing anything about it if anything happened to me. He was a little upset because I've been high around him a lot and he didn't know. But he knows that I can't afford to have a heavy habit so he isn't too concerned about me being constantly high. He did request that I try not to use around him or be too high when we hang out. I'm more of a chipper so that shouldn't be too tricky. 

Thanks for your advice everyone. Everything went better than expected. I am so happy that he didn't break up with me or insist that I quit. He has some drinking problems that I've never given him crap for, so I think he understands. Gonna hang on to this one :)",1379584067.0

The inferno inside refuses to subside.

  I know I am obtaining my ambrosia soon.  The nectar of my god, the only god I truly know anymore.  She grows in far away lands, yet her presence seeps past borders and boundaries.  She is both the bringer of death, and the bringer of life.  Her name is opium.  She has forsaken me time and time again, yet that bears no quarrel from the faithful.  We continue our worship and our rituals.  We want her guidance in our souls.  We devour her fruits, even if they do yield poison.  Why does she have to make it so painful to wait?  Why must she make those most faithful suffer the hardest.  She is a cruel god, but that will not stop our fervor when it comes to honoring her.

The easiest city to cop was SF. I wasn't using when I was there, but that shit was as easy as walking down the right Street. My friends said the quality was shit. Makes sense considering the prices. $40 a gram, it has to be average at best.

Sometimes this withdrawal comes with extreme nausea. Does anyone know any tricks to getting themselves opiated under such conditions? On many mornings, I have puked tabs or trams back up right after they start dissolving. I don't want to waste good ops! Suboxone is probably the worst for this, the taste really makes me more nauseous. I have never shot up and really don't want to. Some things I have tried are plugging and snorting, but these ROA aren't an option for all drugs. This morning, I woke up around 5:30 am and took over an hour just to get my nauseous ass out of bed to snort some H. I felt that if I would have gotten up a minute earlier, I would have puked everywhere. Smoking pot helps most mornings, but if I accidently take too resiny of a hit and get that aweful taste in my mouth, I will puke instantly.

I just went head to head with two different dudes.... 

I was out with a friend of mine, picking her up from downtown and we were walking to my friends car when we heard a skateboard coming down the street behind us. She looked back and it was this guy who has apparently been stalking her. He thinks he's a fucking gangster and is involved with the crews who come up to my town to sell drugs from the city. He is also part of a group of people which includes one guy who actually set my friend on fire this summer after she refused to be gangbanged by a group of guys. She still has massive scabs and scars on her chest and arms. 

Anyway, this asshole comes up and skates around us, in front of us, and stops and walks up to my friend. He starts trying to talk to her, and she's so freaked out she can't really say anything to him. She is too scared to tell him to fuck off. I didn't really believe that he had been fucking with her until tonight, until I saw how he was acting towards her. My friends car was up the block and he was following us, and I was trying to keep myself between him and my friend. Finally I told him that she obviously didn't want to talk to him and told him to leave us alone. He didn't answer me and acted like I wasn't even there, and kept talking shit to her, saying that she better not show her face around that area unless she started dealing with him. Finally I got her in the car-- I had to practically move this guy out of the way so she could get into the car because he was blocking her door. Whatever. He was a fucking tool and I don't give a shit if he thinks he's tough. Yeah, I'm a girl and he could do some awful shit to me, but I'm sick and tired of people thinking it's okay to harass girls and give them to people to fuck. 

So we get into the car and off we go. I was with another friend of mine (we'll call him D) who I was middling for.  My friend J had the connect. I assume he made some money out of it because when we went into the apartment to get the bundle, he got some money back from the dealer. J was drunk and pissed off for whatever reason. We get into the car to go back to my house and J asked my friend D if he could get a bag for hooking him up with the bundle. D says that he can't spare one because he was already hooking me up for doing it. I KNOW that J made some money off the deal because I saw him getting money back from the dealer. Also, we had already worked out pricing and everything BEFORE we went to hook up, and J seemed fine with everything until after the deal went down. 

So J flipped the fuck out. He started screaming at D, leaning all the way forward in the backseat so he was right next to D's head and screaming in his face, ""You better give me something NOW!"" I was in the passenger seat and turned completely around, trying to calm J down. I had to wedge my body in between the front seats so J couldn't hit D. I had D stop and told J that he had to get out of the car. He continued flipping out and screaming and trying to push past me to get to D. I had my arm out across the gap between the seats and he pushed my arm so hard that it felt like it rotated in it's socket. It hurts like hell right now. So J was all up in my face and refusing to get out of the car. I had gotten out at this point and was trying to pull him out of the back seat. There were people on the sidewalk asking me if I was okay. J was still screaming and I thought he was going to punch me in the face, he had his fucking arm up and fist closed and almost fucking hit me. 

I got home finally and go into my room with my one bag out of this whole fucking debacle. I've been sick all day and I'm fucking shaking and freaked out and pissed off. I go to my room and my roommate comes in immediately to ask me if I'm using again. All I could do was laugh in his face. He asked me what was wrong and I just told him that I had to deal with a couple of assholes. He immediately starts asking me if he's fucking safe at the house, and if anyone is going to come here, and if he's in danger, and if I'm fucking using drugs. I can't fucking deal with this shit. I'm not a fucking fighter. I will fight if I have to but one girl taking on two drunk violent asshole within a half an hour time span is too much for me. 

I just had to get this out. All my roommate cares about is if they are going to come here to get me. He doesn't give a shit that I just got shoved around and almost hit by a crazy person. I'm fucking out of here on October 1st anyway. That bag didn't even get me fucking high. I'm still shaking.  ",1379646106.0

http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/2nd-milwaukee-officer-convicted-of-illegal-strip-searches-b9953051z1-215237761.html

1.  I'm in a realllly bad part of the city, and my city is actually probably THE most segrgated city in the USA and the northside (where i was at, is 99% black).  So I'm right about to pull up to the spot and need to do a uturn to do it, so I do this uturn at an interesction RIGHT as an under cover pulls up perpendicular to me.  He initially probably thought I was doing to avoid him but I really needed to make the turn.  Anyway, they hit the lights IMMEDIATELY and pull me over.  Luckily, I didn't have any equiptment and no dope cuz I had't met the yet.  So cop comes up, opens my door, says what the hell are you doing around here? you know theres no white people around here.  After ripping me out of my car and having me stand by my trunk and put my hands behind my back.  At this point, they handcuff me and start searching all my pockets and shit and then all of a sudden I feel his hand near my ass, then all of sudden his finger tried to penetrate my fucking ass hole.  I was obviously super shocked and did what everyon would do, clench your ass.  I clenched up and yelled and I was like ""WHAT THE FUCK? I LITERALLY JUST READ THIS IN THE NEWS THAT YOU CAN'T DO THIS!"" He said ""Yea?  you don't tell us what we can and cannot do.  STOP RESISTING!"" Tried again to finger my ass, and I clenched up again and he said if you don't stop, we're taking you to jail right now for loitering in drug zone and reissting arrest.  So, i gave up all my fucking dignity and let him search my ass.  He then sat me on the curb asking what i was doing yadda yadda, we knwo your buying drugs, etc etc. They saw my track marks when searching me so they knew the deal.  They said ""Why the hell do you give these  dudes money so they can go buy sneakers?  Im sick of dealign with you kids out here buying dope and then when you get ripped off, you call the police claiming you got robbed and we have to waste our time on that BS"" Then another squad showed up and they both searched EVERYWHERE in my car, then went in my trunk as well.  Cops then decide to go through my phone and he looks through all my texts for evidence.  I didnt have any just a text from a week or two ago asking something ""eh can i grab those 2?"" (i was getting subs).  He asks me bout it, I tell him.  Then after searching my car and finding nothing, they put me in the backseat and said ""Well, you have a choice.  You can call your dealer and then when he shows up, you drive away, and we get him.  Or you can spend a night in jail and we'll give you ticket for making an illegal uturn, loitering in a drug traffic area, and resisting arrest.  I tell him the dude probably saw me getting pulled over cuz this was where I was meeting him and he's gonna know its a set up.  He said call him anyway.  So I played along, I was living with my parents at the time and they have no idea bout my using so i just wanted to get the hell outta there.  Instead of calling guy,  dumb cops didnt make me put on speaker phone, so I called a friend I knew was out of town and wouldn't answer, and pretended to have a conversation with is voicemail,  I told the cops he saw me and that hes not stupid and not coming.  I told the cops I'm probably gonna get shot now cuz he's a gang banger, etc.  He said ""Well, now you have even more reason not to come down here.  Get the hell outta here and home.""   This shit was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO fucking illegal, I get really pissed just thinking bout it.  I was thinking bout pressing charges or suiing the department, but I was waiting for drugs and didn't know how to explain that to my parents.  Also, I have no idea what their names were, what district, etc.  That was the last time I used that dealer. Thankfully, I had others, his dope wasn't very good, and I was sick of going to that part of the ghetto cuz it was so sketch.

TL; DR:  Was waiting for dope, got pulled over, illegally searched my car, illegally searched my ass hole, illegally ssearched my phone & tried to set up a sting operation on deal.  End result, didn't get arrested, dealer didn't get set up",1379641379.0

Anyway, I live bout 15 minutes from his ""area"" so I'll call him and he'll 9/10 just say ""Call me when you get down here"".  I'll go down there, call him to tell him im there and he'll give me an intersection to meet him at.  Sometimes, he'll tell you to come to a spot he's already at, otherwise, you wait about 5-10 minutes, sometimes 20-30 if he's busy.  Usually, he spreads out his customers so there's not a bunch of cars full of white kids just sitting around at same spot, but sometimes it's funny to see 3-4 cars around an intersection, ran into a few friends that way before.  Actually feel lucky to have this connect, brought one of my rich friends down 5 days in a row and he always spent $200+ and i asked if i could give him the #, and he was like ""nah man, he gotta come with u, got too many kids on deck already""  Was shocked he'd turn down that solid of custy, but whatever, works out better for me anyway.

It happened, and I was just trying to do the right thing.

First, I alerted my pharmacist ahead of time. I went in with my prescription from my dentist last week. I said this is for my gum condition, and they even gave me a refill, which I assume is for 4 months from now (they do very deep cleanings on me, using novacaine, to prevent recurring problems - I had gum surgery early this year which was horrific).   

This was Norco 5-525.

I said my period was coming up and I suffer from something that will require a possible hysterectomy soon, seeing my gyno in two weeks, and when it happnes I will be calling them for what they have given me in the past which is 10-525. Should I refill the 5-525 from the dentist, or just tell my gyno, or do what? Because I will have two overlapping. What do I do?  The pharmacist said just tell my doctor.  

So sure enough, when the pain starts, I called my doctor's office. Told the front office staff I have the precription from my dentist, and can take that, but my gyno usually gives me 10-525.  Should I take 2 of the 5-525 that was precribed by the dentist and use the refill or will they refill the 10-525? She says she will have the doctor call me back.

The doctor calls back. I have a very to the point doctor.  No bedside mannner. Which is fine, I love her.  But this is her style.  ""I can't prescribe for you. The pharmacy says you have two dentists already prescribing you pain medication. I have to send you to pain management.""   I told her I understood that I already have the pain medication and just wanted to know if it was ok to take it, and she said yes. I told her I wasn't asking for more, just wanted to know if I could take it, and she said yes.

Now, I am seeing her on Monday so I can talk to her about it.  But I am mortified by the fact that she thinks I am seeing TWO dentists (its just that I saw my dentist's boss - they are in the same office, so it's just a different name on the bottle this time - I have had the same dental office for 15 years.  They are treating the same condition). And that I wasn't sneaking around, if anything, I was being brutally honest.

But she is the kind of doctor that if I go in there and try to start talking about it she will just shut me down.  I would rather say nothing. Right now I have pain medicine anyway for the pain, but come next month and leading up to the surgery and post surgery, the last thing I want is a gynecologist that does not trust me.

Two tourniquets, sterile alcohol pads, cotton puffs, twisty ties, and four cookers, all of which I used yesterday :) So a very big thank you to Tracey for helping me keep my habit a bit more safe. My only question is what happened to the needles? They didn't come in the care package. Tracey herself wiill have to fill me in on that.








Secondly, I went to do a small morning dose, doubled up, and am now high as giraffe pussy. I''m tired and have a lot of shit to do today and will probably regret it, but oh well.





And last, for those who've been following my adventures, that dude that wants to buy me everything under the sun is coming to ppick me up Monday. Can't wait! I'll let you know how it goes. Hopefully I will come home with de cash and a fat bag of twak, lol. :)








Hope y'all have a great, nod filled weekend. I know I will. Peace out y'all, I'll let you guys know how everything went on Monday.







PS I somehow obtained a fucking mosquito bite right below my left eye, and now it's beginning to swell. Fuck, why out of all the other more juicy, exposed parts of my body, why the face? WHY?!





K, I'm off. I'll talk to y'all later. See ya!",1379777162.0

My number one rule for myself is to always save a bit for the morning. I need to be able to work. This week, every morning felt like a Groundhog's Day loop of realizing I fucked myself over again. Of being exhausted at the thought of the daily hustle. Realizing my paycheck was days away & I had already tapped every resource.

I spent yesterday dopesick all day at work, but I made it. I was so desperate I ended up setting up two deals for the day. I was dopesick all day at work because I had binged the week before. You would think this would teach me a lesson. You would think this would teach me moderation. But all that rational thought goes out the window when you are dry heaving & shaking and then a few stamps are placed in your hand. 

I'm not looking for the self control to stop, just to make a dose last a few more hours. How do you stretch it out to the limit? What do you do to help yourself moderate use?

I am a long time lurker of this subreddit (about a year i have probably come on here every day). I do some harm reduction work at needle exchanges in my area and love doing that work. I get so annoyed when I hear about states where you cannot even buy points OTC (nevermind any needle exchanges even being around)! I've seen all the awesome work traceyH415 has been doing the last few weeks sending out care packages for people and such and that got me thinking.

I was wondering how many of you live in states where you can not buy OTC or you have a hard time getting access to clean needles?

I have a bit of free time on my hands and was just thinking about today how awesome it would be to start a website that would be donation based/sliding scale spot to get clean needles. So if you regularly buy all your stuff online you could get it there and make a donation. People who are really shit out of luck and dont have a cent could get sent out a 10 pack for free if they really need it. 

The point of this post I guess is to just get a feel for how many of y'all live in states where you outright cannot buy stuff OTC at all?

ps. this is my favorite subreddit definitely by a long shot, you guys have such an awesome caring community here! Have a wonderful day!

Since it has a poor oral bioavailability (about 30-40%) and since it's active on its own without being metabolized, my friend has the idea to use it nasally. The problem is that there is lactose and binders in the pills, so you can't just crush them up because you would have too much powder to use effectively. What he plans on doing is creating a concentrated solution by dissolving some pills in a small amount of distilled H2O and filtering the solution to remove the lactose and binders which are insoluble in water (CWE). My friend will then take this solution and do two things.  

1. Use it in a nasal atomizer bottle similar to a liquid saline solution you can buy at any store.

2. Use it in a Mucosal Atomizer Device (MAD). Seriously, google this thing, it looks awesome and my friend can't wait to try it. It allows you to use a liquid solution to spray any compounds you want into your nasal membranes. This increases efficiency of nasal administration and increases the speed at which is gets absorbed. 
You could use this thing for ANYTHING! I know they use it in some medical settings such as with narcan or midazolam to subdue an overdose or situations where somebody is having a seizure and can't receive an IV administration. Has anybody come across this device??

edit: thanks for the amazon suggestion, just sucks having to wait 2-3 days when wd'ing

I read on another post on this subreddit, that a recently dicovered method to make Loperamide into a formulation that's able to cross the Blood brain barrier and was curious if that might be the reason for the shortage.

its been a lifesaver for me, I really hope it doesn't end up like pseudoephedrine and have to sign some stupid registry for it.",1379821210.0

Well looks like that same thing has happened in my neighborhood recently. I ODed last night, after taking a quarter of what I usually take after looking at it and it not seeming right. I'm fine, although I'm still having some chest pains. After hitting up my dealer, he texted me back saying he also ODed last night, and has gotten a few messages about others as well. I'm sure some of us were not lucky enough to have made it through the night...

I'm just posting this is a warning, that even though it was a new article and they usually blow things out of proportion, dealers selling Fentanyl as Heroin is not a joke, and you should be seriously seriously careful.",1379814089.0

I took a handful of lope... waited and took another handful of lope. By 3pm I'm plagued by cold sweats and what have you. I have been setting here watching neighbors... Watching the mailman... Watching joggers. 

At this point I have already been to my local pharm twice getting WD supplies and as I'm about to walk outside as I notice my convenient hookup was staring me in the face. OMG! I'm shocked... I figure I would have to wait until Monday.

I immediately go back inside and take care of business. 5hrs have now passed and I'm playing with my kid and putting up Halloween decor.

I'm almost positive my younger bro is using opiates (my mom thinks heroin). 

I'm his 27 yr old sister. We aren't very close. In March our Dad was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer and he passed away in May, the day before my brother's 18th birthday. It has obviously been a really difficult, confusing and life changing time. We have all dealt with it in our own ways and in his usual fashion, this brother pulled away and became more distant. I understood it because I am also more introverted and enjoy spending time alone.

Anyway, recently my mom has been losing it because she thinks my brother is using heroin. I live several hours away, so all my information is one-sided and second hand. I fully believe her, but she thrives in drama. Either way, I have no one else to talk to about this and I don't know what else to tell her. 

A little fam history: He is a senior in high school so he is receiving a huge social security check. It comes in his name since he is 18. He lives with our mom. They are the only two in the house. She works 3rd shift. Small town with spike in heroin use/busts and his friends are known for the related activity. Drug use is prevalent in my family. Mother alcoholic in recovery. Late father smoked pot everyday from 18 unil his death at 59. My two other brothers and I are all heavy pot users as well. 

Recently he has been puking constantly. Prior to this, he pretty much never puked before, even when he got sick. He pukes all over the walls in the bathroom, the sink, the tub as if he couldn't make it to the toliet in time. He leaves the puke, refuses to clean it when mom gets home and discovers the mess. Screams in her face, threatens her, and then leaves or locks himself in his bedroom. He skips school, but when he does go she gets sick calls that he's puking or something about him bullying someone (he's probably 5'11 350lbs). 

Shes spying on his bank account and he's getting cash back from the gas station to the tune of hundreds of dollars every few days with nothing to show for it. So he's using something. He's dozens of other physical and behavioral symptoms she tells me definitely describe drug use especially since they are complete changes from his old self. 

What should she do? He's constantly violent, angry and aggressive to her. She calls or texts me daily about how he tells her off and how he hates her and she's dying inside. She tells me she wants to drink. She is half and half between hating his guts and saying she will kick him out and wanting to do everything for him and justifying his behavior and craving his love. 

I'm fucking over it between her and him. She's an enaber and too scared to act. He has always been spoiled rotten and now its completely out of control since he's getting $1200 a month and doesn't need her money. Tho he's still asking her for money. I gave her my several ideas for advice...talk to his former counselor (he used to go for anger before, anger has always been an issue) and try to come up with a treatment to offer him. but he won't admit he's using, he won't listen to a word someone says without screaming, and if he won't admit there's a problem he won't go to treatment. So if he refuses, call to request a police officer be present when she kicks him out because he is so intimidating to her. 

But I run into the same fear she has - if she kicks him out what will happen to him? Will it guarantee a worse downward spiral? Will he fail out of school, lose his social security and become homeless? But how can she continue to live in such a volatile environment? Either way, my fear is she will not act because she lives to be miserable and she wants a magic pill miracle from Jesus to make this better. 

Wall of text!

TL;DR 18 yr old brother lives at home is using something, don't know what seems like opiates maybe heroin. Money and access no problem. Mom is at her wits end. Helpless sister doesn't know how to help. (And is too wordy)

I've finally tried the stuff in the form of very pure SR stamps. I tried two different versions, one highly regarded and much purer than the other. I insuffilated the #4 powder all times. I never felt much of a rush. I actually took some hydrocodone today for the first time since trying the H. I felt so much more euphoric from the tabs. Both hydrocodone and to a much greater extent, oxycodone, feel much more euphoric than anything else I've tried (I'm sure hydromorphone and oxymorphone would be much better as the main metabolites). 

      Maybe it's because I know my dose better with hydrocodone, that 6 7.5s will make me quite euphoric but no nod. In fact, I haven't nodded in years (probably since I first tried hydro and oxy). At first I did chase the nod, but now I much prefer the euphoric mood lift to help with my anxiety throughout the day. Heroin makes me feel slightly euphoric, but not the same as oral hydro or oxy.

I have probably one line left of heroin. I'm thinking of maybe shooting it, but I have never used a syringe and have noone to teach me. What do you guys think, would that make the drug more appealing to me?",1379879957.0

 So yesterday I decided to say fuck it and finally get on the road. Now I haven't been good the past week so and lope has been keeping the worst of it at bay, but I gotta pay my bills first. However, thanks to OT the last two weeks I can pay the bills put some in my savings fuel up and get well! So I wanted to get on the road and get something good, strong and not the typical pills I get. So I went to the sidebar of /r/Bitcoin and through a few clicks I had a coinbase online wallet, but through reading I found out that online ones aren't that good for the same reason people don't use the SR wallet. If it goes down your out of luck. So I got a blockchain wallet setup, I read everything and printed the stuff it gives you so if you lose it you can get your coins back I usually write the stuff down in my little book too. Instead I printed the sheet, screen capped it, saved that on my computer and just skipped over the other stuff because I am super excited right now, I am doing it finally! I went out an bought like 1.12ish BTC and 3 30's off a friend. When I came back, wouldn't you know it! The computer saved my login info like it should have and I got back in with no problems. (sorry for that).


BTC's are still processing or whatever. I snort the blues and jump on SR and start drooling like a kid in a candy shop. ""Yummy A fent nasal spray? That's in my price range! Oh! Or maybe I should try H, I mean /r/opiates makes it sound good, and I can snort it if I get the right stuff? At this point H doesn't freak me out considering I can take 200+mg oxy in a day and not die.. Yea maybe, and a sub or two to keep me good when my extravagance finally dies down. (At this point I get into Minor WD's if I take even like 1 perc 10 for a headache.)"" So now my BTC are in my blockchain wallet and I am ready to order, but I gotta go to work so I figured I would just go ahead and do it later that night. Work was especially busy and last night I really just wanted to crash so I put on netflix and went to bed. This is where things got bad.

 Apparently during my sleep I knocked my laptop off my desk annnnnddd killed it. It doesn't turn on at all. So now I am a little worried. I took it to the repair shop and he told me what I didn't want to hear. HDD is fucking gone. The shock or whatever from the fall, and its an older laptop. I was worried about my BTC but I remembered that the info was printed out, and I have a credit card and need my laptop for school. Not having one isn't an option, especially in my classes. So I went out and got a new Vaio that was on sale and ate up my merger $300 credit line plus the extra cash I had for the rest of the week. Regardless I took it home to set it up. When I went back to open my block wallet I needed the password and the login info. I reached for the printer and grabbed the paper AND ITS ALL JUST FUCKING LINES. Here is everything I need to get to my bitcoins and on the road and it looks like FUCKING MISSINGO! SHIT! That was this afternoon, I spent the rest of the day with tech support but the page is gone. The printer works now, ^^yayyy...  but my bitcoins and everything I needed to get to them are gone. Now the 30's I took are starting to pick a fight with me, while the other WD's are starting to catch back up with a vengeance too. I am fucked till next Monday and my BTC are gone too! UGHH ITS LIKE GETTING ROBBED BY THE UNIVERSE! 

I opened a new blockchain wallet and a friend on a forum suggested I do those free bitcoin sites but they pay so shitty for surveys and even worse for putting malware by downloading  games or whatever. Fuck it I am gonna get the last of the lope steal a grapefruit juice from work and bite the bullet.  Sorry for the wall of text, I needed to get this out because it is unfair and I kinda want to cry. I was looking forward to my first time on the road. 

TL;DR Universe robbed me of my 1. BTC for my first time on the road through unfortunate events, my carelessness/excitement, and hardware malfunctions.

It's starting to become alarming. I have always had a very strange sub-concious that would take the thoughts in my mind to dark places, I would imagine violent and disgusting things and I couldn't stop the thoughts. I would imagine my own death or suicide. I hated myself. From a young age. But now something has changed since I first IV'd heroin. It feels like I might actually kill myself. At one point I had over 600k in the bank. 8 years later I am flat broke and addicted. I have an amazing girl friend, great friends and family. I just can't escape the darkness that engulfs me. If I have money and means I am fine because no one can tell me shit. But now here I am in reality playing by the real rules and I don't think I can adapt. I hate the Right. I can't stand the Left. Fuck the Center. Hard. I am a Libertine to the core but there is an evil inside me that has always been there. From a young age I had sadistic tendencies and fantasies. That dark side really comes out when I drink... 

I have not written or spoke to anyone this openly before for fear of becoming a pariah. Even though I kind of have always been. In school people often didn't like me. It made me into a paranoid man who thought everyone hated me. But once a good friend of mine said he had never heard someone say anything bad about me. I couldn't and still don't believe him. Who could like me If I hare myself? I am consumed by the darkness. I have become tired of chasing the flicker of light.

Here is my painful recovery of getting clean... I have been using oxcodone anywhere from 15-60 mg every day for a year +. I've wanted to quit for awhile but was too afraid of the withdrawals. So here is my run down of all the sympoms I've been  experiencing and how I've been dealing with them... 

Last dose: Monday- 10ish mg at  5:00pm (by far the least amount I've done in months)
Tuesday morning, 6AM- tossed and turned all night from the RLS, got very little sleep, had that gittery feeling all morning, watery eyes and nose start also. I have a Rx for Xanax 0.5mg, so I took one of these to get some sleep, it slowed the RLS, but even after that i was sleeping on and off. Got online looking for some home remedies for RLS, found some B/S about putting a bar of soap under your sheets and rubbing legs on it. Whatever, I did it, i'm desperate, didnt do shit... obvisiouly...

Tuesday 10am- Getting ready for work, ugh... the muscle aches really start kicking in, took 2 Aleve. No appetite at all, forced myself to eat a banana with some vitamins. 
Tuesday 11am-Worked for 3 hours, and then the nausea kicked in along with the worst muscle aches I've ever had. Can't stop yawning, and eyes watering consistenly, also the hot/cold shivers get bad. Took 1 tylenol, and 1 ibprofen (i'm a small chick), I puked and was sent home.
Tuesday afternoon-walked the dog, took 2 aleve, 2 xanax passed out for a while to sleep through the aches, watery eyes/nose, jitttery feeling, anxiety, and the worst RLS. husband cooked, coudnt eat.

Wed, 6:03am- everything wore off, more aleve and xanax, the rls is awful.... 

more to come, its got to get better soon, right?!

Wed 2:30 pm-Did I mention my husband and I are going through this together? We're both sick fucks! haha... He's not going through nearly what I am... 
We took our dog to the park, and I forced myself to walk. By the end felt like fucking death, like I ran a marathon, aches are back, super lethargic, sweaty, hot/cold.. wow, this stuff is the devil, and the best drug ever at the same time..... I have 1 oxy 30 left and I don't know what to do with it... eat a little by little piece to keep the symptoms at bay or will that keep delaying the inevitible w/d...??

Fortunately I haven't gotten too deep into things yet and I promised myself that I would not let things get to where they were last year namely by spending all my money on dope and ignoring all my other responsibilities. So today as my budget for dope had run dry I was all set to get some lope after work and just chill out. Work was pretty slow as it tends to be on a Wednesday night and I wasn't making much money tip wise. Then the last hour of being open we had two large parties come in, and I was the only server on I took them with a few others that came wondering in after. These people were awesome and understanding as it took me a little longer then usual to get everyone set up considering I alone was taking care of 25+ people (they had me hosting, serving, bartending, bussing etc., everything except cooking lol. So as they were wrapping up one of the customers who was taking care of the bill slipped me an extra $50 for my tip. Needless to say I was very thankful and when they all had left I called up my boy, I didn't have high hopes because he usually isn't around this late at night but he picked up and assured me he would be around when I was done cleaning up. Score! So what I thought was going to be an uneventful night turned out pretty, preeetty, preeeeeeetty good (Larry David voice).

TL;DR: Went to work broke not expecting to be able to get high, got a extra tip at the end of my shift and was able to score making tonight a good night.",1380089106.0

I know, I know-- this is not a new concept. I am just trying to spread the idea so people can imagine a world where things are done differently.

Warning, this makes too much sense-- the weak or frail minded should stop reading now.

What if you could go to a psychiatrist, doctor, etc. and get prescribed opiates for whatever ails you, via a signed consent form. Imagine it: you could now have the one thing that cures your pain, your depression, and makes life so much better, by going to the doctor and filling out a few forms. You don't have to spend 25,000 dollars on multiple doctor visits to finally get treated with the one thing they should have given you in the first place. After all, isn't it our human right to ingest whatever we please? Especially if it is the miracle drug that helps lead a happier life? Being babysat by federal regulations is not for anyone's well being, or ""saving lives"". its all about money. wouldn't life be easier if there was a ""fuck the bullshit"" button?

You acknowledge the risks and dangers, death, tolerance, and what not. You are responsible for all consequences of potential self risks. You agree not to sell to minors and those who aren't prescribed under SEVERE penalty.

I know most people don't do it and a lot of people say its a waste, but I personally really enjoy it. I've IVed in the past as a way of getting high off less, but don't plan on doing it again (the risks aren't worth it in my mind, it never became a habit for me so I figured I'd stop before it became one). I find that smoking it works to get me high off substantially less than what I would need were I snorting (the high is shorter though obviously).

Lets say I have some dope where I'd have to snort two bags to get contently high. Instead of doing that, I can snort half of one bag, then as that snorted dose is kicking in, I split the other half of the bag into a few bumps, and one at a time put the bumps on my foil and smoke em (depending on the quality/ quantity this can give a decent rush but not nearly as strong as IV). When I finish smoking the third bump I have a nice, pronounced high going. 

If I had just snorted a single bag, I'd more than likely wanna have another bag to really be content.. The high from smoking doesn't last as long, but at least, for a bit, I'm able to really enjoy my high rather than just having an unsatisfying buzz.

 r/drugs but here it goes

i started using tramadol 2 months ago promising myself to not take more then 3 times a week. I took about 40-50 times the past 2 months 300-750mg each time, just quit recently and i can tell you its not fun.

The physical stuff: You know after a long night of clubbing/dancing or walking around for hours, that pain you get in your legs and feet, almost like growing pains. you get that but it doesnt get were off and lasts for days.

Ever have gotten a really bad cold? runny nose and all that? yea put that into the list to. and you dont have no energy to get up from bed in the mornings if you are lucky enough to get some sleep.

The mental stuff:

Ever done something bad when you were drunk and really regret, and just cringe when you think about it? You will get that too, and remember bad memories of things you done or said wich makes you cringe 20/7.

Hard to sleep. and a feeling of wanting to take more and get high(wich was the easiest part and didnt affect me much at all)

And everything above can be gone and you will feel much better if you just take a few more pills.

Conclusion:

was it worth it?
yes it was all those nights in complete bliss without any anxiety and any fear and your problems, this is a mild payback. i can now see why opiates are so addictive.

I cant imagine what longer users are going through when quitting cold turkey. Let alone heroin users, allthough tramadol is just the lightweight of opiates.

will i do it again? honestly, probably yes, but i will try to control it better this time. i sometimes under my high thought about being on it 24/7, and if it would be worth it. it makes me feel that i can fit in with the rest of the world.

just wanted to share,,with you guys who got alot more experience.

I am not completely innocent in all of this, but here's the deal: I am moving out on October 1st, hopefully going to Portland, OR but things aren't quite lined up yet so I will need to find a place to stay for about 2 weeks. I decided to not be a bitch and ask my roommate if that was okay, because he'll be staying in the apartment by himself. He flipped out and basically ranted at me for an hour about how much of a burden I am on him, and how psyched up he's gotten about having the apartment to himself, and how he really needs ""time alone."" 

Here's the thing, though. I am culpable in this because he has been helping me out financially for the past couple months, sharing his food and booze and cigarettes with me when I run out of money towards the end of every month. I feel REALLY badly about this. I know part of his concern about me staying is that he doesn't want to have to carry me any more, but I will A) be paying rent, and B) i'll have my security deposit back so I'll have cash, and C) I get food stamps on the 1st. So that shouldn't be an issue. Plus, he's been bitching about not having an easy time coming up with the full rent himself so me staying an extra 2 weeks would help him out a lot in that regard. 

I could potentially stay at my parents house, but here's why I don't want to: 

*It is completely in the middle of nowhere and I do not have a car, nor can I borrow a car from my parents because they won't let me drive it without a license. I will be stuck on the top of a dirt road and I won't be able to even go to the store on my own. For 2 weeks, if not longer. 

*My father sleeps on the couch in the living room (don't even ask) which is right at the bottom of a very creaky set of century-old farmhouse stairs. It is almost impossible to go up and down the stairs without waking him up, so when he goes to bed at 11:30 I am effectively stuck in my room, unable to go down to the fridge, to the computer, or outside to smoke a cigarette. 

*My cell phone doesn't work at my parents house. They do have a landline, but there is NO privacy. 

*I won't even be able to watch TV if I want to because of the open floor plan and the fact that my parents hate TV (I'm not a huge fan either), but I also won't be able to use my own computer because there is no wiring upstairs in my room. 

*My grandfather and my aunt will be there for a week at the same time as me. This will be UBER annoying. 

So, instead of just TELLING my roommate that I was going to stay another 2 weeks, which I feel I could have done because it was MY apartment to begin with and HE moved in with me a couple years after I had been living here. So I was really just being conscientious by asking his permission. 

But he sat there, unwilling to say either yes or no, and for an hour he berated me about what a selfish person I am, what a burden I am to him, how he REALLY ""needs time alone"" (as if he won't have it after I leave). Finally I got sick of being told that I'm an awful person and I got up and told him that I wasn't going to sit there and listen to how awful I am, and that if it wasn't okay to just TELL me it's not okay and that will be that. I then went into my room and shut the door. A split second later, I hear all sorts of crashing noises from the living room. This went on for a few seconds and then he slammed out of the apartment. I went into the living room and everything was trashed. He knocked books out of the bookcases, the coffee table was upside down and sideways, a side table was broken, the ashtrays were spread on the floor, books were everywhere, beer bottles had spilled, etc., etc. Shit had been knocked off the wall. The cats were under my bed, hiding. 

So now I am in a really tough spot. I could just tell him to suck it and that I'm staying anyway, because I feel like that is my right as long as I can pay my own way. But I really don't want to deal with the awkwardness. I understand that he really wants the apartment to himself, but I'm leaving soon and he can have it then. It's two fucking weeks. He accused me of not being willing to live in a ""kind of uncomfortable"" situation at my parents house, but he doesn't realize that it's not just sort-of uncomfortable-- it's downright isolating and suicide-inducing. Really. I feel like killing stuff when I have to stay there for more than a couple nights. It's even worse when my extended family will be there. 

And also, he thinks he's the one who is so displaced living here with me, but I stay in my room on my computer constantly because he is always in the living room, in front of the TV, watching whatever he wants to watch without a thought about sharing the remote. I am unable to have friends over when he is here because he's even more antisocial than I am. Even when I do hang out in the living room with him, he will make phone calls and sit there talking on his phone without a thought about going into his room to give himself privacy and to not disrupt me. Instead, I go into my room. It's bullshit, but I've felt so bad about his helping me out that I have put up with it. But now I'm screwed. I know I'll probably be at my parents for more than two weeks, so I wanted to split the extra time between my apartment and their house. 


I'm really sorry about the wall of text. I really needed to get this out, and I like you guys so I wanted to post here. I'm really fucked. It doesn't really sound that bad, but the reality of it is much worse than it sounds. I literally feel I am trapped, smothered, and dead when I stay at my parents for very long, and it will be even worse with grandpa and my aunt there. 

TL;DR: Roommate had a temper tantrum, and I have to stay at my parents house in the middle of nowhere, literally, without a car, phone, computer, or TV. The closest store is 15 minutes away. Driving. I can't leave my room after 11:30pm or I will wake up my father. I will be trapped there, literally. ",1380148841.0

I was devastated when he died. I was in a couple punk/indie bands during high school and my taste included Sonic Youth, Slint, Fugazi, Black Flag, Melvins, Ramones... you get the picture. During this time I mainly smoked trees and had a beer whenever I could cop some.

As I got older and into my 20s in the early 2000s I started listening more to Art Rock. I liked At the Drive-in, Secret Machines, Queens of the Stone Age, Mars Volta, Trail of Dead, and what not. I was also in a pretty decent post rock group that some of Reddit may even know. During those years, I experimented with everything I could get. I k-holed, tripped, candy flipped... I basically tried everything.

Toward the late 2000s... I became more responsible. I graduated college, worked full-time, had a kid and got married. I also started drinking heavily just before all that happened. Having a kid slowed that down for the better though. My taste of music was more on the lines of Alt country or rock revival stuff... My Morning Jacket, Strokes, Fleet Foxes, Wilco, Ryan Adams... You know. During this time I loved beer and tress. I wasn't really doing anything else... until I developed very bad chronic back ailments. 

Fast forward to present times... My taste of music has changed again. I listen to a lot of hip hop. I love Kid Cudi, Tribe Called Quest, Common, Black Star, Yeezus, Lupe Fiasco, and even some stuff like Deadmau5 and on and on. I like flow with substance... and with my substance I need substance. My DOC now is prescription opiates. I get them because I still have back issues and they allow me to exercise, work, and be an involved parent.

I really don't know how I could survive without opis. I never really do anything else. I never drink anymore, but I do still have the occasional blunt. Once or twice per month at most.

If I have them... I love bumping to beats. If I run out or wd-ing... I'm back to listening to melancholy stuff like Unwound or  Nirvana. 

Do you guys have musical swings that correlate with you wellness. What about over the years? Does your music play out with your substance abuse?

EDIT: I think it would be interesting if each of us could take recommendations and then state in a post which one we give a try. This could be an awesome way to step outside our norm and maybe even find a new artist that we can nod/bounce to. ",1380146981.0

we have been fb chatting for the last few weeks.  last night i happened to mention i needed a hookup after he told me he could get dillys.  i originally wanted some dillys because it's been so long but the guy that had them wasn't available.  so he asks me if i would just take some boy.  well duh.  then he offers to introduce me.  yay.  so after busting my ass to sell a suboxone i finally made my way over to him and we went and met new guy.  

new guy hooks me up with a straight bag for 15 bucks.  the standard around here is 20.  then he tells me that he will sell me gs for 150.  the standard here is 200 (i know crazy right?)  150 is much more manageable.  i got his phone number and turns out he lives right net to my work and doesn't mind swinging by and dropping off a lil something on the front til payday.  woo!  i'm pretty happy about that.  i had done some crank earlier this morning that i got for picking up a box of sudafed for some lady and it took the edge off so nice.  still a little tweaked and wish i had some more but oh well.  on friday i'm going to pick up a 40 dollar quarter g.  sell half of it for 40, then hopefully be on my way to coming up a little in the hustle game.  

on that note, i have been hustling more and more lately.  for a while my growing habit had me spending more and more time broke.  but i got sick of it and i've gotten to point now where i can start a day with 0 dollars and by the late afternoon at least have hustled enough to get well, buy a pack of smokes, and a few tall boys of beer.  today was no exception.  i sold a line of that crank to a coworker for 10 bucks.  he fronted me a suboxone and i sold half of it to this desperate chick for 12 bucks (yea i'm ruthless i know) and came out with 22 bucks, half a suboxone, and a decent bump of speed.  all because i bought a box of sudafed for some lady with her own money.  woop woop!  hustlin!  

have a great day guys!  i just got all dressed up and i'm going to do something fancy with the old lady.  cheers!  (sorry the amp fueled ramblin!)",1380143365.0

Here are some pictures of my recent pick up. These bags are typical of what I've seen from several different dealers who have no connection to each other so this size stamp bag seems pretty standard for my area.

Now, I've bought dope in baltimore and it never comes in stamp bags like this but its ~120 a gram. These stamp bags cost me ~100 a bundle. I don't have a milligram scale to weigh to contents but I'd say the average bundle has ~.3g in it, total.. This is from anyone who I scoop from (which is always hood dudes, I don't know anyone else who sells the stuff). I'm a well off white dude and the guys I buy from are broke hood niggas so I expect to over-pay a bit, but I KNOW this is ridiculous.. the fact that all the bags are the same size makes me think that I'm not being skimped, just extremely overcharged. I'm wondering if its typical for bundles to actually sell for closer to $50 instead of $100??

EDIT: the one thing about the bags up here is that, although the bags are skimpy, the dope seems significantly more pure than what goes around Baltimore. Not for it to be worth paying so much more for it, but it is more pure (I imagine this is because the dope sold by weight can be cut easily by anyone in the supply chain, the dope in the stamp bags can really only easily be cut by those who have the dope before it is bagged up.)

I have a good reason, a couple years back I took 100 mg before work, then another 100 mg 30 minutes later (I may have taken another 100 mg at some point too). I was working hard in a restraunt kitchen when the air conditioning was out, it was over 95 degrees in there. I started getting a big shaky, then the next thing i know i wake up in an ambulance and am told i had a seizure!!! I didnt expect only 400 mg to cause this! The night before I took a very tiny (less than 50 mg) dose of MDMA , only my second time to take it, and I didn't really feel much. Maybe that contributed? But I felt nothing I thought it was bunk or either too low dose.

Obviously I wouldn't tell him I took so much, but I was thinking about telling him I had a very minor seizure on 100 mg and am scared of them now. I don't want this to backfire and I have to spend hours doing tests for epilepsy. I also don't want my tram prescription replaced with cafergot(or do I? I would collect alot for lsd synth) or some bs like that? I doubt my doc knows about the seizure threshold reduction, he actually told me tramadol was not a narcotic (ROFL).

As I went to loosen the tourniquet on my right arm, I managed to wiggle my arm a bit, which resulted in the needle spinning around while in my vein.  I was left with a bruise, and the area was tender to the touch for about a week.  I gave my right arm a rest until the bruising and tenderness went away, but now I cannot register in that vein at all.  I can hit myself in plenty of other places, so that's not an issue.  I'm just pissed because the vein in the crook of my right arm was so easy to hit before my needle spinning incident.  

Do you guys think I could have collapsed the vein?  If so, will I ever be able to use it again?  I'm sorry if this has been answered in the past.

Edit: Here are pictures as requested.  Sorry for the shit quality.  I noticed the skin above the vein still looks a bit yellow.  I compared my vein to pictures of collapsed veins on google images, and it doesn't look collapsed based on the images I found.  Now my questions is, what the hell is wrong with it if it isn't collapsed?  I used to be able to hit that vein so easily, but now I cannot register in it at all.

I have been a lurker for a long time now, always enjoying the contents of this subreddit for its honest people I can relate to. Also this is a throwaway.
So here goes my story: I Fell in love with opiates (only h) about 7 yrs ago, having an on and off relacionship since then. I snort it or smoke it if a get some bueno stuff. Altogether, I've never been sober more than 1 month in a row. My usual routine is to stick just to the weekends. Lately that got out of control and I'm using more.
I wanna break out of that cycle, consume, quit cold turkey (which is never that bad cause my tolerance is Low, but still those are useless 2 to 3 days where I can only hang around doing nothing) and as soon as I feel better I am thinking like: ok actually I do feel fine again, quitting isn't that hard, I am going to buy sthg again. To feel shitty 2 days later again....
It is especially hard for me as I can Call my dealer and meet him whenever I want to.
What advices can you guys give for those moments the heroin devil overtakes? In those moments I feel like I am controlled by some superior power, I just have to go score again just to get rid of that tension inside my brain.
Also the whole thing is cosnuming lots of money (I pay about 40$ for 1 bag, which is about 1 gram decent enough h for my tolerance) and all people around me don't know about it.
Give me some help for those times when I am actually not in w/ds, but just can't think of sthg different!?

If you guys haven't listen to any of these shows I'd HIGHLY recommend giving them a listen. Each explores different aspects of this reality. Duncan's Family Hour is an exploration into the esoteric nature of our universe and exploring the workings of mind and spirituality all while being hilarious. Joe Rogan is the most frequent poster (and has the most guests) his show's topics range anywhere from Big Foot, Aliens, History, Theoretical Physics, to MMA, comedy, sex you name it, it usually depends on the guest he has on and he has some greats (The NTD episode is outstanding). And Ari picks a topic and explores it from people who live it. It's great to just listen and nod away, better then a TV show because I don't have to watch anything lol.

If you're all willing, here's what I'd like to hear:


1.) What is your opiate of choice, or the opiate you end up using most often?

2.) What is your preferred ROA?

3.) How long have you been using? If you're not a chipper, how long have you been using every day? Feel free to mention breaks, clean time, etc.

4.) How much of your substance do you need to use at one time to achieve a solid high? What does it to catch a good nod? Opiates tend to be best (in my personal opinion) when taken all at once in tolerably high doses. Yields more defined euphoria/sedation, longer duration...

If you'd like to be more specific, feel free to include your threshold diosage and what you consider your maximum dosage. (Bordering on personal danger even. After all, there is a fine line between nodding for a minute and nodding forever.)


Thanks in advance for any and all responses. I nerd out on statistics like this, especially when they pertain to areas of personal interest. Like opiate use, ya know. Doing dope happens to be one of my favorite past times. And black chicks.

I realize the specific character of the rushes are surely quite different, but I mean purely in terms of intensity. Rating on a scale of one to ten how would you score the intensity of a fat hydromorphone shot, and how would you score a ""bell-ringer"", ""train coming into the station"" shot of white. Obviously this is highly subjective, but I want to get an idea from the folks on here who have done both. 

I'm looking forward to seeing some scores! I'm also hoping that I can score some Dillies and finally experience the coveted HM rush I hear so much about.

As another quick thought - I always hear that while the HM rush is heavenly, the high is kind of underwhelming and has zero legs. Has anyone ever mixed HM with a longer-lasting opiate such as morphine or dope? Has anyone ever done a speedball with HM? 

Be well and happy nods to all! 

EDIT: Damn, all this talk about mixing the HM with Morphine and Dope is making me fucking drool. I've been shooting morphine as of late and have really grown a liking to it. I even dig the histamine blast now, which I hated the first few times. The only major disadvantage is its poor water solubility (~60mg/mL).

To perform this, I used roughly 60-70 ml of water at about 30 degrees celsius, stirred it, and then chilled the solution to near-freezing. At this point, I removed it, and poured it into a cup that had two coffee filters over it. I did not squeeze out the filter, as I am extremely paranoid about acetaminophen. I then cooled and filtered this solution twice more, and chilled the final product in a refrigerator for a while; the result was very slightly cloudy with no visible residue at the bottom. I did not enjoy it, and immediately became paranoid about the amount of acetaminophen ingested; I weighed the white gunk in the filter after it had partially dried, and it weighed out to about 18 grams while still wet. I mean, I followed the instructions on this shit to the letter.

I've been having some very mild upper-right abdominal pain today and yesterday with no other symptoms.

Basically, I had never done opiates before. The most I've had were a couple pills after I had a tooth pulled.

I ended up finding 3 bottles of pills-Tramadol, oxycodone, and hydrocodone. All with varying amounts of pills inside.

I started with the Tramadol and took about 3-4 a day until I ran out in a few days.

Then I started taking the hydrocodone...10/500 was the dosage I think. I took 4-6 pills per day. I didn't do anything to help my liver, and I know that wasn't good.

This lasted for around two weeks.

Finally, I took the oxycodone. 5/325. Four or five a day, for a straight week.

So all in all, I used for a little over 3 weeks. Everyone I knew basically told me that was too soon to get an addiction. Everything I googled backed this up. So I didn't have a plan to taper down. My last dose was Thursday, a full five oxy.

Well, I don't feel good.

I had extreme diarrhea (sorry to be gross). It got to where I was afraid to leave the house.

That stopped and now I just have no appetite. The thought of eating makes me sick, so I haven't in a couple days.

I can't sleep, and haven't since Friday. When I lay down, I can't sit still.

Hot and cold chills.

Mostly I'm just depressed. I feel like my miserable life isn't worth living. Those pills were the only thing that made me happy in years. Why does everyone else get to feel good and I don't?

I just want to sleep.

My friends told me that this is all in my head because I didn't take it enough to have a dependence, and that I probably have the flu.

Are they right?",1380543960.0

And lo, they laughed.","Alrighty SOOOO I've been tweaking the fuck out ever since around 2 PM yesterday thanks to my oft-mentioned cutie pie middleman  surprising me with a (very, but idc I'm grateful) small sack of meth on our way to go get our usual skimpy as fuck sack from what is quite possibly the world's biggest fuckin douchebag of a dealer ever. Without fail this guy manages to sell me a sack weighing out to half of what I paid. I wish I had another dealer but that is neither here nor there.









Any fuckin ways I wasted two shots earlier by doing them too soon after tweaking and wisely decided to put away my last big shiny black rock. About ten mins ago I decided I could do half to help me wind down. So I pull the rock out, put it on the counter, and, careful to make a semi circle around the area, use a card to split it in half.








Well wouldn't you fuckin know it, I manage to keep one half but the other flew into oblivion and is nowhere to be found. I saw a couple crumbs near the wall but that's it.  The bathroom is all tile so I know it isn't stuck to anything. I have searched and scoured to no avail. I think it may have hit the wall, and bounced up and over my barrier into the sink and straight down the drain. I'm raging so hard right now. Idk what I'm gomna do tomorrow but I do know I'm fucked.

Some of you may know my situation. I came cold off 25mg of methadone a few months ago. Last dose was July 10. I picked up again around the 15th of August and have been using on and off since. This is mainly from lack of money. Not this coming Thursday but the following one I'll be getting my first paycheck from work. 

I'm trying to find ways to get high, conserve money, and not develop a dependence again. I've been hanging on by a thread so far but I feel like its more of a lack of money than anything else. Is there some sort of daily schedule you guys know of for use that would stop tolerance build up and also avoid dependence? Is once every two days good enough?

My doc is IV dillies but I can also easily get morphine and H when those are out.

I also have a script for naltrexone waiting for me at the pharmacy for when I have the money. Could I use these somehow to maintain balance?",1380511585.0

I was at peace and euphoric, which I expected.  I was surprised by how great my body felt kind of like all of my cells were being brought to a roaring boil without heat and in an extremely pleasurable way.  Anyway about an hour after I got all the liquid down I noticed my eyelids getting heavy and then I'd wake up and have the show I was watching be half over.  Must've done that 20times and with each new ""nod"" I found I had a little more control over what I dreamt about.  It was fantastic, but the thought I might be close to OD was always distantly present.

It was only a year+ ago, I was doing those beautiful OG80s. (Canadian here). My dealer eventually ran out of his supply just like everywhere else. High and dry for a bit, he came into some OG40s, which kept me happy for a bit. One day, he ran out, and offered H instead. The idiot I was, accepted it. 6-8 months on and off, with horrific withdrawals in between, I've realized that the crippling guilt and depression I get from using H is just too much. It's cheaper, you get more of it, you're constanty redosing, it's just too much,

I want to quit opiates some day, but I just have that constant desire to get high. I can't do any stimulants (Speed, Coke, etc) without craving opiates even harder because they feel ""lacking,"" or when I come down, I just feel like shit and wish I had a warm blanket. I'm sure those of you with poly-drug addictions (or not) can relate.

I feel like I need to take this slow, so I might just chew up/Coca cola an OXYNEO 80 every now and then to catch a fix.

I was sniffing 2-3 points of H, every other day, or a few days in a row, with 3 or 4 days in between. I've just gone through a mild withdrawal period, and I'm on day 6. Feeling pretty normal and craving again. But I just can't go back to H, it's too slippery of a slope.

My question is, will I even feel Oxy any more? Will I have to take a shit ton of Oxy to get a buzz? I know everyone is different, but I just want some feedback and/or personal experience for thought. Thanks!",1380475083.0
