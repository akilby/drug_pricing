Jim and Jan are friends whom I used to \(and still do\) hang out with every week, maybe a couple of times a week to bullshit around on my computer, maybe learn to code with my friend who did such for a living and smoke blunts. Eventually I was getting into snorting roxies and dope with Clifford and some days I'd leave before too late to meet Cliff or would hang with Cliff instead of hanging out with Jim and Jan. No big deal, this couple who are my friends aren't dicks, they don't give me hell for not being around and if they do they do so for kicks. Surely a bit out of some genuine concern. Jim doesn't like many people so it's high praise if he's wondering to his wife ""where the heck has Sloan been?""

&nbsp;

Well, eventually I was doing dope and pills more frequently. Some of my [early Cliff posts ](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/67l68l/another_post_about_the_waiting_game/?ref=share&ref_source=link)were generated by the situations I got myself into back then. Things like ""Cliff owes me three bags, I'm sick and still waiting."" Such posts often consisted of a blow\-by\-blow breakdown and under a different user name than this one although both separated from my real life associated net aliases. Anyway, it was bullshit. In a question to Cliff I'd ask,[ ""did you see Zaino yet?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/67l68l/another_post_about_the_waiting_game/?ref=share&ref_source=link) It's fun to reflect now that I've made strides in preventing and outright avoiding such scenarios.

&nbsp;

So I'd ask and get such great hits as:

&nbsp;

\- ""It's going down now."" \-Cliff

Over the course of four hours it would become evident nothing was going down. I had my ear tuned to the sound of the middleman's ice cream truck so when I heard it I'd check out the window, notify Cliff and wait for good news. All that only to find out the ice cream man only offered crack and had no dope. In retrospect, maybe the ice cream man really owed Cliff dope and delivered it. If it was a small amount, there's no doubt Cliff would opt to stick it up his nose and not share. These days I am on direct communication terms with Derrick the creamer man and although I would never let myself get into the aforementioned situation again, if I did I would get answers from a less untrustworthy source.

&nbsp;

\- ""Zano just got out of the shower."" \-Cliff

I guess he gave this detail to indicate that the dboy wasn't enroute yet, but would be getting ready to deliver shortly. Of course for a stalling bullshitter, any number of excuses can be made to explain further delays. ""He gotta pick up from the guy, then make a stop, then come here."" Something like that.. it varied. See lost Cliff posts for details.

&nbsp;

\- Other assorted scenarios where Cliff owed me 2\-5 bags of dope repeated throughout the month that I was missing from Jim and Jan's life. A bag being equal to 1/10 of a bundle, 3 bags isn't really significant but nonetheless it is an amount that I was owed and promised by a set time. 

&nbsp;

\-On an early occasion, like after the first Cliff post I was asked to loan him three bags of dope and in exchange for five bags the following day. Interest \-\- that interests me! So sure, I did it only to wait and encounter delays. Often waiting until script day for Cliff to pay me back. I think that was the weekend I spent re\-watching all of Gundam SEED. 

&nbsp;

In the last two bullet points, those insignificant amounts of dope couldn't do much. Maybe could help with a little rationing and maybe could help as part of a taper plan to reduce the intensity of withdrawal. However, doing without such small amounts two days into the withdrawal at least allowed me to be further along in the process. Consuming a couple of bags of dope two days into a three day weekend before a work day would likely reset the withdrawal cycle.

&nbsp;

Eventually rationality won out, I knew there was no way to have enough dope to never be in withdrawal, so if I was to continue using, it only made sense to prioritize getting Suboxone. Cliff appeared to be cooperative but things always went wrong. It was a jynx when he said ""we should never have to go through withdrawal again."" This was said when referring to our existing and new connect for the stuff but both had their deficiencies. One of them drove and sometimes didn't have them upon arrival. The second guy was hit or miss and almost every time I got subs from that guy I was splitting them with Cliff so they only lasted half as long.

&nbsp;

Fast forward a bunch of months, the end of 2017 draws near and Cliff had me buttered up to get $200 in subs at a grand discount. It seemed good and true although I had no evidence. No evidence of his ""friend who gets a script but doesn't use them anymore."" When I finally dropped the $200, just about the last of that pay check I am informed that his ""friend"" has a ""brother who still uses dope."" As a result, Cliff had to buy dope to give to the guy with the subs in exchange for subs. The guy with the subs would then give the dope to his brother. Of course as I waited for the subs to get delivered Cliff stated he fucked up and explained that the guy's brother came by in the morning, picked up the dope and the guy with the Subs stopped answering his phone right after that.

&nbsp;

The night before when I handed over the money I thought I was doing my due diligence asking a series of questions in hopes of ensuring nothing would go wrong. Cliff said that I was stressing him out, ""you're doing that thing you do where you ask the same questions over and over."" I wonder why I would form that habit.... In any case it's obvious I was right to be so inqusitive but stupid and wrong to follow through with my end of the bargain.

&nbsp;

After that I started covering my ass more hardcore. Right before thanksgiving Cliff was talking about getting a brick of dope and I knew he was just trying to butter me up to get on board with committing funds. I said outright, ""I'm not looking to spend my paycheck to get a brick of dope."" To which he said, ""I'm not saying that you are."" Then he went on to say how he was going to get it with or without me and how important it is to not be sick through the Thanksgiving holiday. ""If you don't get dope, I know I'll just end up giving you dope as you need it."" Saying this to build a case for my voluntary investment, because if I didn't have my own Suboxone connect and plans in place he would've been my only option when the sickness started setting in.

&nbsp;

Come Thanksgiving and Black Friday Cliff did not buy bricks of dope. He was couped up in his bed relegated to urinating in Gatorade bottle to avoid walking to the bathroom and incurring his mother's wrath. Why was he broke and without dope if he was indicating just a week earlier that he would have money for dope? Obviously \(I think\), if I went along with the plan he presented the week prior I would've been screwed out of a bunch of money and only gotten half the dope I paid for. From there, I would've likely been sick for Thanksgiving and Black Friday. For work days in which I would be standing for over 12 hours, it's a very cruel setup. Maybe that wasn't Cliff's intention but it certainty wasn't a priority for him to prevent me from going through that experience if I was stupid enough to help him.

&nbsp;

To be continued. For now let us rejoice in the knowledge that we all have the power to ensure we are not dope sick. Let's also rejoice that too many other people don't have a ""Cliff"" in their life. For those who do, just remember that you are the captain of your own destiny. With the yank of the ships telegraph you can tell your engine room to steam forward as you steer a course of your choosing and none other.

&nbsp;

Oh, and yes, I do appreciate my friend Jim and Jan. I just hated traveling to their house dope\-sick although I did at one point learn that on day three or for of dope\-sickness that bicycling and smoking blunts helped tremendously.",1528067997.0

**for every 30 upvotes ill post another part tonight** hahaha

---

When i was young i was fascinated with sticking my finger in light sockets. My mom used to tell me ""baby go zoot zoot"" in her creative attempt to deter me. Still, i would keep on shocking myself. Doing things i wasn't supposed to felt good if only because it was forbidden. When they told me to never try drugs, same thing. I think i will tell my kids drugs are not the problem. It is doing them daily which is the problem.

By high school i already knew i would become a drug addict. This was before i had ever even seen a maryjewana cigarette. My perceptive friend would always say, ""dude you sound so stoned"". ""You listen to Pink Floyd and The Doors, you gotta be a pothead!"" Well i was sober, but not by choice. I was so antisocial that i never had access. One day i found out the local skate crowd might know where to acquire some of the herbal remedies making up all my daydreams as of late, dozing off to Dark Side of the Moon. I imagined the feeling to be like the orgasmic tonal qualities of the female vocalist in Great Gig in the Sky. 

I wish i could tell you with certainty that it all began that day. Of course i dont believe that. I lean more towards the destiny theory, or wanted to. It was completely inevitable i end up with an insulin syringe full of oxymorphone sticking out the crook of my arm, held in the sturdy hands of my 50 year old pseduo-doctor junky friend who stayed part time in this drug den. on paper it was registered to the sweet old lady taking us in. I'm not exactly sure what made me make the jump to IV use. Okay, maybe it was peer pressure. Maybe it was... you guessed it: destiny. 

How i was led to this situation is a typical story. I was bored and lonely and just generally jaded with life. Depression since high school had caused everything to take on quite a grey, cold quality (kinda like the atmosphere of a fent buzz). All the weed i smoked helped while it lasted. All this smoking led me to meet many strange characters. One day a weed dealer of mine has this 50 year old guy with him in the car. He says ""hey man if u can get any needles i can hook you up. We have hydros."" Now i had used opiates here and there, but i had never been friends with an IV user. This immediately sparked my interest. In the back of my mind i thought ""this is my chance"".

A few more weeks go by of me simply buying hydros and then eventually opana. I would walk the few miles across town to get to my special little drug den. So many different characters lived there: Roxanne, the sweet but sometimes sour (when on benzos she was a bitch) girl who used to tell me im beautiful. I wish i could say the same for her but seeing a woman crying, hanging upside down from a dryer, trying to register in her last good vein in her foot and failing is not flattering. She was literally a bloody mess. Then you have Red, the hyper junky with obvious disease eating away at his liver. He only shot with gigantic needles. I forget what theyre called. Then Bob, son of our town's huge dealer. Last but not least, Dan and Dillon who would become my using buddies for the next sixth months. 

Dan was a wise 50 year old normal ass dude who got divorced for good after years of slowly falling deeper into addiction. I could tell his wife and kids not wanting him in there lives was the main drive behind his search of a chemical hiding place. He taught me more about the dope game than anyone i know. I loved chilling with him, mostly because i had faith in him to *always* find something for us. He knew everyone. One number fails, onto the next. If that failed we go driving until we find it. 

Now Dillon was probably one of the dumbest kids I've known. He could read but beyond that not much i could say about him. With that said it makes me feel even dumber for letting him be the one to peer pressure me into that shot on that fine, warm day in June. 

It was a normal day like any other, but my life would honestly never be the same after. Well my brain never functioned the same. I walked the normal walk across my small mountain town, felt in my pockets for my 25$ as i turned left up a backroad past the bank. I always recall the dog in the first house on the road barking like rabies where leaking out his ears. Almost like he knew how bad i was about to fuck up. 

I reached ole granny's drug den, going in the front for now because i wasnt labeled as a junky yet in her eyes. I passed Roxanne and a couple other randoms who were resting on the couch. ""Hey sweetie"", she always greeted me in a manner which caused a few butterflies to float up my chest. She was a very attractive woman despite all her self abuse, in her dark sunglasses and tight blue jeans. Her eyes had seen as much pain as any miserable person ever had, if they were open. 

I said my hellos and was ignored by the Granny as usual. She knows why I'm here. I make my way back through the kitchen to the backroom, where i see a gnarly site of two dudes sticking themselves like pin cushions. ""Uhh hey yall got opana?"" I hated trying to snort these endo series ones, but that is all they had. I bought a quarter of a 40mg pill for about¬† 25$ (ridiculous). It was then as i tried to leave dillon comes up to me excited. ""Hey man you gotta try it this way! It is so much better! The rush is unlike anything you have seen"". I told him i didn't know how. ""Danny is good at this man, he can hit ya!"" 

Now danny wasnt ignorant. He at least acted like he wanted to talk me out of it even if deep down he knew he wanted me right in the gutter with em. Why not? Free drugs for them for finding them for me. This was always my deal. Sharing never bothered me. I have empathy for my fellow addict. He finally saw it in my eyes i had decided my fate 20 minutes ago. ""Okay, we got you a fresh rig"".

As he reached up into a little hidden cupboard for the box of needles, i kinda saw my life flash before my eyes right there. What would my mom think of me now? 

I was in for the electrocution of a lifetime now...

Holy fuck. I've wanted to try this drug for fucking ages. I've done almost every opiate/opioid and I kinda wanted to just be able to say I've done it, really. Heard people say it's the closest thing to oxy without being oxy.

Well last night I did it. Started at 100mg and then kept dosing for a solid few hours till I'd done 400mgs. Was alright I guess, nothing to rave about. Wouldn't really recommend it even if what I'm about to explain had't happened.

So I wake up like 8 hours later. My head is fucking POUNDING. I drink some water and instantly fall asleep again.

2 hours later I wake up. Head is pounding again but I sit up and drink. Everything feels 'off' but can't place what.

I go to stand up and become extremely dizzy but stumble to the bathroom. My vision is completely fucked, like when you stand up really quickly sometimes and it's almost like you're blacking out (orthostatic hypotension).

I feel fucking awful but cannot tell or place why. My head is pounding and I'm struggling to concentrate on anything.

I decide to jump in the shower. I'm hot. Unusually hot. As I'm showering my chest becomes insanely tight and I suddenly start to freak the fuck out because I have no idea what's happening to me. Suddenly I realise the tight feeling in my chest isn't really tightness in my chest, it's my body telling me it's about to vomit.

I jump out the shower and vomit 4 times. 

I feel a little bit better but still feel WEIRD. And still quite shit.

After my shower I was feeling even better so calmed myself down. I go to clean my teeth and I'm brushing when I look in the mirror and see a man in the doorway behind me. Blink. Gone. It made me actually physically jump in fright.

Then I'm freaking the fuck out. But get dressed and sit on my bed on my computer. Then the auditory hallucinations start. FUCKED UP ones too. A female voice I've never heard before talking about killing people?

At this point I decide that I need to pop a benzo to stop these hallucinations otherwise I risk actually falling into psychosis (they were freaking me the fuck out and every time they happened I was getting more and more stressed).

I pop 1mg clonazepam under my tongue (praise the lord for clonaz). It works and the hallucinations subside. I do some stuff and for a while, although I feel ""off"" I'm okay. I eat a little and feel on the mend but I am having difficulty concentrating and I'm worried because I have to study for a final I have tomorrow.

Then it's like 1pm and I sit in my bed and I just fall asleep. Like boom. I keep waking up every hour or so and trying to stir myself but it's physically impossible. I have enough time to set an alarm on my phone and then I'm out.

I sleep 4-5 hours and then finally I'm able to stir myself but the audible hallucinations are back and I feel even more weird. I take more clonaz.

I start freaking the fuck out because I am like a vegetable. I can't do anything. If I go to text someone on my phone, by the time I've got half way through my sentence my eyes close and I drop my phone and then a few moments later I 'come to' and it takes me a moment to recollect myself and I get back to texting. I MAY be able to finish the sentence before it happens again. And this is for everything I do. I go to my laptop and want to go to youtube. I type ""yout"" and by the time I'd got to there, I'd blacked out again, and then came to. This went on for like 2 hours until I had a shower and really moved around a bit which seemed to fix things.

It helped but not completely, and I'm like ""I need a stim or I can't study"" so go and get some caffeinated drinks, which appear to help.

Now I'm sitting here balancing my caffeine intake extremely carefully because too much and I feel really fucking weird but i HAVE to study.

I'm throwing that shit. It fucks with your serotonin system. I can tell by the type of hallucinations I was having. Fucking dark, extremely realistic and scary. Thank fucking god I had a benzo because I felt like I was going mental and I'd consider myself someone who has a 'strong mind' I suppose.

Be careful with that shit guys.

Therefore, I thought it would be cool to write up a guide based on my experiences and research. I‚Äôm sure some of this is common knowledge but bear with me please for those who don‚Äôt know. 

Lets start with the withdrawal symptoms and tapering. The first thing you need to know about your withdrawal symptoms is that you are going to live! Opiate withdrawal in and of itself is not fatal, even though it definitely feels like you are actively dying. The only way people really die is from dehydration, or from ingesting too much of other drugs like booze and benzodiazepines during a withdrawal. I doubt y‚Äôall need a list of withdrawal symptoms but if you do want more info, this aspect of withdrawal in particular is well documented all over the internet.

https://www.healthline.com/health/opiate-withdrawal#outlook

Some key info: The length of time and the severity of your withdrawal symptoms are going to be directly proportional to three things: 1). The half life of the opiate you are going to be jumping off of. 2). The amount of opiates you used 3). The length of time you used for. Shorter half lives such as fentanyl will be the most intense but briefest, where longer half lives like Suboxone and Methadone will be less intense but last longer. Choosing a substance to jump off of is important and will vary depending on your needs and personality. I prefer longer WD that is less intense, but you may only have a week or so off work or something where you need to be able to be back on your feet sooner rather than later. You can find info about half lives on wikipedia, and look at withdrawal diaries for various opiates with a quick google search. I hear Kratom is a decent option considering its legality and chemical properties, but have no experience with it myself.

Now that you‚Äôve chosen what substance you will jump off and know what your in for: lets get to tapering. If you plan on using Subs please be aware of precipitated withdrawals. Only take the lowest possible dose to eliminate withdrawals when switching to Subs 

https://americanaddictioncenters.org/suboxone/precipitated-withdrawal/

Tapering schedules can be created with the help of a doctor or by following someones else guide, but everyones needs are different. Personally, my favorite method is to find a stable dosage for 3x a day dosing, one when you wake up, one mid day, and one right before bed. Once you have this you can do a variety of things to reduce. You can skip your mid day dosage starting every other day, you can slowly increase the time between doses until you can make it to only twice a day, you can slightly reduce the amount of each dosage, or you can do a mix of these things. The idea is that you are only as uncomfortable as you can tolerate. If you want to be done sooner you can be more aggressive, or you can take your time and do this over the course of months. Its really up to you. As long as you are slowly taking less in a 24 hour period than you were before you are making progress! 

While a proper taper is a huge part of a successful detox, an equally important part is gathering the supplies you will need to be comfortable. I‚Äôll start with the easiest to get and move onto the harder things.

1). Tissues with lotion/aloe (your nose WILL thank you)!
2).  High quality toiler paper, wet wipes, and or a bidet (your asshole WILL thank you)!
3. Good food that doesn‚Äôt require too much work; you will be ravenous but have little energy to cook. Soups and salads are great (the salads will help with the shits). 
4). A relaxing fragrance for your bathroom and room (they may get smelly). Bath bombs and the like are great for hot baths (which are super helpful). I took at least one hot bath a day. 
5). Something to keep your mind occupied. Video games, tv shows, movies, youtube, reddit, or whatever else floats your boat. Anything to help shift your focus from feeling like shit.
6). Imodium - for the shits, which you will be doing a lot of. 
7). Your favorite sports drink and ginger ale to stay hydrated
8). Marijuana - preferably an indica strain. This will help with literally ALL of your WD symptoms. CBD is also legal and very helpful if real pot isn‚Äôt an option for whatever reason. 

For the following prescription medications, if you are honest with your PCP (doctor) I would bet money they will prescribe AT LEAST the first three for you. If not, time to find a new doctor. The last two are a little harder to get, but being open and honest helps a shitload here.

9). An anti-emetic like Zofran if possible. If not then Pepto or something similar will do.
10). Clonidine - a blood pressure medication. This will eliminate almost all of your cold sweats and shivering. Its a fucking life saver.
11). Gabapentin - an anti seizure medication commonly prescribed for restless leg/limb - which you will essentially have during WD.
12). Cyclobenzaprine - a muscle relaxer that will help with all your achey muscles.
13). A Benzodiazepine like Valium. This will be the hardest to get, but most doctors will give you a bout a weeks worth if you involve them in your taper plan and don‚Äôt demand it. Always be extremely careful when taking benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants. If you are in WD, you should be okay with low dosages. Do not mix with alcohol. Its one or the other, never both.
14). I don‚Äôt think you can take this with all the other stuff - more research by me is needed - but I know Librium is also a really great drug for detox, though I‚Äôve never taken it personally, I know people who have. 

If you cannot afford to see a doctor or don‚Äôt have insurance or whatever the case might be that makes getting these drugs legally difficult, you should be able to find most of them fairly easily and cheaply on the street or the DNMs. 

If you can stay somewhere with non judgement people who will support you like family, thats awesome! If you can‚Äôt, isolating yourself from bad influences is the next best thing. If you want to attend meetings, by all means do. There is no requirement that you be sober, only that you want to be. The idea is human contact is good if its good people. Exercise and sunshine are also great if you can get them. 

If you are able to get/do most or many of these things its going to be an order of magnitude easier than if you don‚Äôt/can‚Äôt. Please let me know if I left anything out, and I hope this helps!

Regarding Psychedelics: I need to do more research before I would be willing to speak confidently about them and opiate withdrawal. But if you want to do your own research I would look into psilocybin and DMT/Ibogaine.  ",1528058008.0

Roughly six weeks ago maybe 2 months I injected into my left arm and I hit an artery I've been injecting for 12 plus years and I've never come across this phenomenon. I've injected into that same left arm on three occasions now for after that this one being the 4th on every occasion my arm is the same thing as it did that one time it feel as if fire is flowing through my veins especially my Palms hurt. I know for a fact I'm not an artery because the blood is not bright red but he darker almost purple color second because there's no way that I just happened to hitting artery in for completely different spots they're not even close to each other. It even starts to burn if I don't inject I'll stick the tip of the syringe in and the whole time. My question is why is it that no matter where I hit weather it's a used fit or a brand new one it burns I get hives and pretty much the same results happen as when I hit the artery that one time today I hit a vein one that I've hit for years now same symptoms occur and like I said I've hit this vein for at least 5 years now I still feel the rush but this time I didn't and like I said I stopped as soon as it starts to feel any pain.. today I actually felt no pain as I got about halfway through the injection and I drew back a second time halfway through injecting as I always do it's just habit I want to make sure I'm still on the vein and I was and as I started to inject the rest of what was left and as he got a little bit more and I started to feel the pain not as painful as the first few times but still a pain my arm got covered in hives not as bad again but still my palm hurt my hand hurt my whole arm hurt and even swell up a little bit I took Benadryl to ease the swelling and now it's gone no rush at all happened whatsoever I cooked up another one this time hit my right arm or should I say right hand I pulled back and register twice and even a third time to make absolutely 100% sure I was in the vein last time I hit this vein and develop cellulitis and it was a bad experience so I took extra precaution and made to register as much as I could to make sure I wasn't and blast off got about 60 units in registering pull back 10 more units and once again it was still in the vein or it registered at least and I finished it off Upon finishing it off put my hand a few times and waited about 2 minutes no rush at all so no rush for the first one or the second injection either I must have injected 0.35-0.40 each one now I feel a bit tired but I'm not sure if that's because I'm high or not last night or two nights ago maybe you will have any idea as to explain to me the phenomenon that's going on here? Why no rush on either shot? And why is it that ever since someone hit my vein for me I've never really in my life missed that much of a shot and whenever I miss you in one or two units I stop immediately I've never in 12 plus years stroking artery I myself or anybody else. Anytime I drew back and knew that I was in artery I never even injected the blood and the brightness of it gave it away every time ever since I made the mistake of doing that this is what's been going on like I said can anybody please tell me how to fix this because now I just wasted a majority of the 1.5gs I had and although I'm well I feel no rush or am I high I'm a little sleepy but I'm not entirely sure if that's hitting an artery or simply feeling sick little bit. Even when I have it injected I will stick the tip of the needle into my left arm whether it be in my hand forearm or ever and even without injection is still starts to burn just from sticking a needle in and it's a pain that I cannot describe because it's pain like no other and it occurs every single time I attempt to inject into my left arm no matter where they hit no matter where I am poking I get the same sensation the same hives the same pain and no rush or if I do Rush the pain and anxiety over, so I barely get to feel it I felt I do rush at all. When I hit my right arm no problems like this always rush when I have my legs no problems the rush is good strong and painless. Extremities I'm going through are these normal? Is it normal to not be able to hit my arm that I hit an artery in even 6 to 8 weeks later after the incident? I mean yea I'm worried but the same time I feel okay I'm more concerned with the fact that I won't be able to hit in my left arm ever again without experiencing swelling like this and pain. Like I said the second shot I check registry every time I pulled back but why injecting take your phone no rush no high , does anybody have any idea why this may continue to be happening it's been four different spots to so it's not like a repetitively Pony the same hole that I poked when I got the missing vein and his artery in the first place I rotate spots I'm also using a brand new fit every single time most of the time I don't even jacked it just starts to burn like I am as soon as I Put the Needle in and I pull out for instance yesterday I want to see if anybody else me if have this issue or e how it can possibly be fixed I would love to hear what works for you or at least what's going on with me thanks for listening guys much love bropiared and happy nods. Hopefully I figure out what's going on soon because I'm seriously just about to throw my fix get away and give this up all together it's not worth it especially in cases like this I'm too old for this stuff and my life is too important thank you guys for listening and letting me vent shitpost over",1528055913.0
8ob26j,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ob26j/staying_clean/,4,https://redd.it/8ob26j,red_hi_tec,Staying clean,"So I'm not sure ehy exactly I'm posting right now. Probably because i have no one else to talk to about my drug issues and just wana let out how i feel.

So my story is long but ill keep it short. I relapsed about 16 days ago on dope. Before that I had a relapse about 3 months ago on dope again. So i only used 2 times within like the last year. And both times I did it it just made me feel sick and pushed me harder to stay clean. 

Now I really dont know if i want to be clean or what. I think I do, stuff is going good for me without opiates. But part of me craves benzos or pharmaceutical opiates. The dope is trash now and %99 of all dope contains fent or fent analogues. So sometimes I crave doing some 30s. I can get them 10 mins away from me too, but i havent got any in years.

I know benzos bring bad things to me and so do opiates but i still have many days where I want to change how I'm feeling so I think about how much happier and better everything would be if i was high. I used to love going to work high, it was fun and pretty entertaining. Now going in sober, some days can last really long and sometimes i get an overwhelming sence of anxiety and depression. Like crippling anxiety. Part of me wants to get back on xanax cuz i used to be prescribed it. But i would abuse them sometimes and end up doing stupid shit like smoking crack. (Fuck crack I never wana touch that shit again, makes me feel like im going to die, seriously) 

So sorry about the rant but i would apprciate it if anyone can leave me some feed back.

On the 28th of this month, my year of probation for having a weed pipe (yay deep south and crazy strict laws) will be over. Before being sentenced, I knew it was coming so I got on methadone as I knew my likelihood of stayed 100% clean the whole time and taking zero chances were very slim. I've had absolutely no problems with wanting to use since I started MMT but I'm not sure how big the fact that I knew I had random monthly tests at my clinic on top of totally random ones thru probation was in helping me not really think about using. With the 28th coming up, I'm not really worrying/thinking about using but I'm definitely worried about that changing. I really feel i was mentally prepared to start MMT for the right reasons and the upcoming probation was the final factor in my decision but I still worry about how I'll feel once I have my freedom back. I will absolutely start smoking weed again as I have never destroyed my life over it like opiates. I suppose it's good that I already know I'll be using weed again but haven't even thought about using opiates again to ""celebrate"" like I would have done in the past.

In around 2005, my house was raided because apparently someome ratted on me to save their own ass. Needless to say, the police were VERY disappointed with what they found versus what they were told they would find. My initial charges were seriously trumped up (I suspect to make my later felony plea deal seem all the more desirable). I ended up pleading guilty to possession of hydrocodone (2.5 lortab is what I had as far as hydro goes). I got a 3 year suspended sentence to be served on probation. Was supposed to have atleast 1 random drug test a month from my PO but I had a total of zero. I had 2 from the judge which I knew about 2-3 months beforehand. I used most weekends after the first few months. My probation was terminated after only 1.5 years and I went immediately back to daily use until pretty much a year ago. 

As I said, this was mostly to vent plus it ended up being longer than I expected but I wanted to know of anyone has been in a similar situation? How did you handle your freedom once you got it back? I get 110mg/day methadone but that gives me some pain control for ~5-6 hours and a slight glow for the same amount of time after dosing. No nod or anything like that. I also am prescribed a very large amount of Xanax daily but only binge on that for a weekend or 2 after getting my script and I've built up quite a stockpile with the rest. The only drug I just cannot stop myself with is opiates so that is why I am worried. I've used for over 15 years so I realize that I'm quite likely to die each time I use again just based on the amount of time I've been using.

Sorry for the rambling/ranting/bullshit. Hope everyone is doing well this weekend!

tldr; get off probation on the 28th. Worried I will start using opiates recreationally again even tho I've done very well on methadone the past month. ",1528040257.0

My first experience with any opiate at all was this morning. I took 20mg hydrocodone at 7:00am. I woke up at noon ate some food, took a shower and re dosed 20mg and ended up falling asleep again until 5:30pm. My dreams have been very vivid also its been hard AF to take a shit. Also I have not jacked off all day. Like I know its there I just do not feel like it. Im planning on taking 10mg before I go back to sleep as this drug just seems to make me sleepy. But when people described opiates to me and how they were wrapped in a blanket of euphoria I will admit this shit is kinda underwhelming. I feel relaxed and a little numb and generally ‚Äúok‚Äù. Its a very calm and not in your face kinda drug.  But then again maybe it is because I have never been dope sick before. So my favorite part of this experience was I the ‚Äúnod‚Äù (Daydreaming with your eyes closed idk lol).


How was your guys first opiate experience? 

Where they underwhelming at first? 

How did you end up getting hooked?

I am wondering if going on methadone is a choice that could help stabalise my life for a little bit? As i am worried this cycle is going to kill me, or st least ruin my relationship with my family and friends etc.

Nobody knows that i use, would i be able to hid my methadone use? As in i wont be telling anyone anyway, but would it be obvious? 

People say dont go on methadone just cold turkey, which is fine,n but i always emd up relapsing which is the main problem...

Can you go out for a few drinks in the evening, say  a few pints of beer? Or is no drinking a must on methadone?

After all we are merely the result of billions of years of evolution. Nothing more than a sentient bag of flesh. Doesn‚Äôt that amaze you? We are seven billion people in this world all different from each other, yet strangely all the same. When I‚Äôm in the metro going back to my parents‚Äô house after some class at school, I think to myself: this train passes every 5 minutes, and every time, thousands get off, thousands hop on, all having somewhere to go, something to do, someone to see. We are so insignificant et yet so powerful. I don‚Äôt know how to make a battery, let alone a laptop, yet electronics play a crucial role in my life. How did we go from apes to humans? We know the how, we just don‚Äôt know the why. After millions of years of evolution, humans never found their rivals. I mean yeah, animals are pretty intelligent in their own ways, but no animal comes even close to our level. We
At twenty years I trying to find my place in the world. Convincing myself that my menial job of delivering pizzas and studying finance for ten hours a week is a fulfilling life. Life is dull, life is pain. Pain that you‚Äôre not good enough, pain of failure. Pain can often times be derived by fear, and anxiety. Anxiety that all your friends will surpass you, if they haven‚Äôt already. Fear of seeing you little sister fail while following your path. Fear of never being able to by that GTI, or that RSX, or even just that Civic, that I should have been able to get by now. Fear that I‚Äôll never move out of my parents‚Äô house. That at thirty years old I will be the only one after Brandon and eventually Joseph, that is still working at that pizza joint. Fear that everyone will move on with life, and that I will be left behind. When the good old days of closing together and getting high afterwards will be gone. Fear that my parents will have spent four thousand dollars a year for nothing. Sending me to private school while waking up at 7 am on Saturdays to drive me all the way across the city for swimming lessons, then back the other way for Kung Fu. Obviously then followed by scouts. 
Everyday I have this intense fear that I will not be good enough. When you always hear ‚Äúyou‚Äôre very intelligent‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôll go far in life‚Äù, you‚Äôre not like the others‚Äù, well what happens in the end when you don‚Äôt? What happens when you don‚Äôt become that doctor, when you don‚Äôt follow the path that way drawn for you. I had everything to succeed: relatively comfortable household with supportive parents. Healthy lifestyles, good friends, top schools, no mental health issues. Every was handed to me on a sliver plate, yet I managed to spill the contents and pawn the platter for drugs. 
While I get anxious about life, about all this bullshit, I sit down in my shitty corolla grind my weed in one hand and roll up the filter afterwards. The sweet smell rises in the air directly into my nostril. The green goes in the paper filling it up to the brim. Roll it, lick it, twist it, light it. Inhale the good shit and exhale the bullshit. As the marijuana smoke enters my lungs, the tiny capillaries in my lungs diffuse the THC into my heart. This muscle‚Äôs relentless work allows the drug to reach my brain in a matter of seconds. My brain loves it. My head feels heavy and foggy, I smile and put on some music, I fee a tingling sensation in my stomach. I am in a state of pure happiness. If I die right now, I know I will die happy. 
Tonight, is a special night. We‚Äôre going to the club. My friends and I have decided it would be best instead of renting a cabin for the weekend. I‚Äôm ready. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm broke these days, but I need this. Walk up to the bar, shot of J√§germeister. Say hi to people, talk about school and life. It‚Äôs not so bad after all. I do enjoy talking to them. Steven shows me the bag of gummies. Delicious but, let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs some pretty weak shit. I have to act surprised, as if this little piece of candy will elevate this party to the next level. I still take one, cause, why the hell not. But that got me thinking I should probably pop my Xanax. I order shot and break off a quarter of bar.
 God I love these white little magic pills. Even at ten dollars a pop, all I need is a quarter bar and I‚Äôm good. It lowers my inhibitions, I get loose and talkative, no filter to my speech. Another shot, I‚Äôm looking for that sweet spot, that sweet spot where my other drug comes into play. I don‚Äôt wanna pull it out too soon. I want to be fucked up enough to enjoy it. That‚Äôs the thing about coke‚Ä¶ on it‚Äôs own it‚Äôs kinda underwhelming. But in the right condition, it can be heavenly. I go to the bar, shot. On the dance floor the music  is blasting, I‚Äôm jumping around this is fun.  I don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything. We take another shot. This is the moment. I tell Joseph I‚Äôm going to the bathroom and he follows me. We get in the stall and I pull it out. The little magic bag. Happiness in powder form! I dump some on my phone. Crush it up good. No chunks. The ritual is almost as fun as doing it. I chop up my line and a smaller one for Joseph. He takes it without hesitation. Weird, he usually makes a fuss about doing cocaine. He doesn‚Äôt really like it. But he still got in the fucking stall! Go figure! I drunkenly roll up a 20 dollar bill and snort my line. I instantly feel alive. Everything is good. The cocaine molecules just hit the capillaries in my nose and they are getting into my bloodstream. My heart beats faster. I am in a total state of euphoria, probably smiling line an idiot. 

We get out of the stall laughing and dancing to the beat. We go back to the join our friends, nobody knows what we just did. That‚Äôs the thrill. But what can I do to feel even better? I drank, I ate some THC and some benzos, I just snorted some blow, but my brain is still fiending for a higher level of intoxication, of more gettness and more giuness. Oh I know. A cigarette. Now is the perfect time to go smoke. I ask Brandon if he wants to smoke. He likes smoking. He‚Äôs not the type of person to smoke a shitton or drink or do drugs, but he sure does like smoking cigarettes. But only good cigarettes, the type that costs 15 dollars a pack. None of that  john players shit. Brandon likes the finer things in life, which explains the 2009 Lexus he bought with 150 000 kilometers on it. We go outside and Brandon hands me a Benson and Hedges cigarette. I light it, draw up and blow out a puff of smoke. It‚Äôs a cold march night, but I‚Äôm feeling warm. Or am I just too drunk to feel it? I instantly feel the rush of nicotine hit my brain. I feel blessed. As he tip of my B&H  cigarette glows bright with every draw, I think about life. Here I am intoxicated out of my mind, smoking cancer sticks, but I love it. Slowly killing myself is the only time I truly feel alive. 
I come back home, stumbling and drunkenly unlock the front door. My mom is standing there asking me how the night went in a judgemental tone. She doesn‚Äôt like the fact that I was out until 2-3am, which isn‚Äôt even that bad considering my coke fueled parties sometimes last until dawn. Little did she know, my night has not ended yet. 
These friends of mine are very vanilla compared to my other group of friends, my frat brothers. They get to the club at 10pm and leave get a few drinks, dance a bit and leave around 2 am. But I am not done yet. I go to my room and reach my hiding spot wear I keep my stash. The anticipation is such a rush. (Even just writing this gives me butterflies). I take my parafanelia and head to the bathroom. I lock the door and get hot water running. I crush up 3 8mg dilaudid between two spoons, the brand name of my favorite drug. The love of my life, hydromorphone. These little white triangular pills with 8 on one side and two Ds on the other. I drop the powder in my syringe and add some water. I lube up the back door and shake the syringe to dilute my drug. I lay down on my tummy and slowly insert the tip of the plastic syringe in me. I quickly get it in. I can‚Äôt wait to get fucking high, blast off. I push the plunger and hot water gushes through my colon. I wait a bit to make sure all the drug gets absorbed. I take my pone out and start browsing facebook and youtube. By the time I finish a three minute video, a warm blanket covers me. I take out the syringe and get myself up. I feel heavy and my eyes are almost shut. I am in a state of pure euphoria. My body is completely numb. I fucking love my life. I curl up in my bed warm and high. My eyes are half closed, and my mouth is open. I dream of random stuff while my whole body goes through waves of and orgasmic feeling. My face looks dumb and I probably have a stupid grin on my face, but I am in heaven. I love this.

I go inside and cook both myself and him up a shot and divide it up, giving him a little less than me (his tolerance is lower than mine), I do my shot first because I have to hit him too.

So I do my shot and immediately notice something is ""off"" about it, didn't get that taste in my mouth that tar always gives me. Plus the overall high / feeling was dramatically different than normal so I assumed I got an extreemly heavy fent bag. 

I proceed to shoot out even more of my boyfriends shot, now very weary about it. I normally have a lot of trouble finding a good vein on him but tonight I had no trouble and got the boy done real quick, which was a good thing becsuse I was starting to catch a nod and my vision was becoming distorted(I don't know how else to describe it).

A few minutes pass and I'm brought out of my nod by this strange noise that I at first thought was an animal. I turn around and see my boyfriend laying on the bed, unable to breathe. I jumped up and tried to give him some oxygen via rescue breathing.  After about fifteen seconds of this I realize I need to act now and start to panic as I force myself not to freeze up.

I grab my kit which was laying on the ground (I took some photos of my kit and dope for some dope porn for this Reddit.. ikr) and grab my Narcan nasal spray and give my boyfriend one spray, me- still panicking and afraid it wasn't any good or had expired; I grab an unopened nasal spray and use that one. After that I went and grabbed my actual vial of narcan and slammed my syringe into it and tried pulling up the solution with my trembling hands. 

While trying to draw narcan into a syringe, my boyfriend sits up in bed and then completly stands up off of the bed, with a puzzled look on his face looking at a disheveled me frantically stabbing a syringe into a vial so forcefully the syringe bended.

A total of a minute and a half elapsed but it was the longest time of my life, I had shouted ""someone call an ambulance"" when it happened but didn't realize my roommate was out; another second and I would've called them.

After explaining everything to my boyfriend he doesn't want to go to the hospital, but me and him both agree it is ""time"" to try and put the demons to rest.

History - starting using opiates about 2 years ago with 15 mg oxys and never really got past 45mg in one day mark and then tried heroin.
The heroin - at first it was brown and flaky and the drip reminded me of licorice. I would do a few bags here and there and honestly thought of the high as mellow at first and not as strong as oxy.  
Then my dude starting getting this white stuff.  It was usually straight powder that didn‚Äôt need to be cut up much but sometimes has soft chucks in it.  My friend did 3-4 at once the first time and was throwing up for hours and almost losing consciousness.  For a while I could just do half a bag and this was this the first time I really got a rush from the stuff and felt extreme euphoria. This was all sniffing.  That‚Äôs when stuff got really bad and eventually I was doing 14 or more a day 5 at a time and couldn‚Äôt do less then 9 in a day without feeling pretty bad.  
My friend tried to come off of it once pretty cold turkey and after 2 and a half days he was vomiting bile every 15 minutes and thought he would actually die and gave in.  I came off of it once or twice and it was terrible and lasted a weeks but I never had the yellow bile and always started using again pretty soon after. 
I recently started suboxone because I was doing 14 or more daily and my friend, who is the only other person I know who used the same stuff, convinced me I could die from withdrawal from producing so much bile.  It was a great decition but it took 55 hours until I felt sick enough to induce which was crazy.  24 hours I felt fine and 48 hours after last dose I was only like a 5-6 on cows and wasn‚Äôt risking it.  
Anyway I‚Äôm convinced it was basically fent or a fent analog but some people have said otherwise and I‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has had experience with something like this.

In cases where people with big tolerances try to induct on suboxone, what typically happens is a few days or more of pretty miserable semi\-WDs that, once you've taken a blocking dose of suboxone \(say 4mg or more\) there is nothing you can do about but suffer through or return to your DOC, which won't work very well for the next few days. But a lot of people have discovered that if you slowly raise your sub dose over days, while lowering your dose of heroin \(this mostly applies to heroin users, or VERY high\-dose pharm users\) you can \(relatively\) painlessly transition to suboxone alone. 

Success stories, disaster stories, anything in between! All would be a majorly valuable \- and potentially lifesaving \- resource for this community.",1527994779.0

The people on r/drugs told me [these](https://imgur.com/a/RnwA5DU) 30mg Oxycodone are pressed/fake/from the DarkNet/Laced with fentanyl. 

This doesn't make sense:

1) I used to always get high off them, I just need more now. Probably built a tolerance?
 
2)My boys who are lighter/smaller than me still get wasted after one or two pills.

3) The dealer used to go to Community College with one of the boys, this is how we got to him. Not just random dude online or on the street.

4) He fronts us many times and we always pay him back, sometimes even tell him keep the change.
  
5) Not to sound like a dick, but he doesn't seem to know how to order drugs via the Dark Web.

6) More importantly! How am I and all my friends *knocks on wood* still alive after popping these for months?
        - I thought a small dose of fentanyl can kill someone. I've taken over 300mg of these pills https://imgur.com/a/RnwA5DU and some M30's https://imgur.com/a/GhWyndC

Just got wisdom teeth out four days ago. They prescribed me a TONNE of Vicodin and I feel incredibly addicted to the rush. I will eventually have to stop soon, due to only having a few days left, but the high is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I can see myself easily getting addicted to this. I absolutely love the heavy/light feeling and the warm waves that just seem to pass over you. I have never felt so comfortable in my own skin.   
This experience has been such an eye\-opening experience to opiates and people who use them regularly, and I have so much respect for people who deal with addiction.

Anyways...

Is there any cause of concern for me? What is the next course of action?  Is an addiction to this substance really that dangerous? I've noticed increased productivity, and incredible creative sessions \(I am a musician\), and an improved relationship with the people around me \(I usually argue with my father multiple times a day, and hasn't happened once since taking this drug, and we've grown closer.\) 

Sorry if this post is a little na√Øve, this is all just so new to me. 

Would appreciate any reply. ",1527991007.0

I ran out a few days before my Dr. appointment so, in desperation I found a cotton that I had used 3 days earlier, mixed it with water and did a cotton shot.

About 30-45 minutes later, I got an intense fever with cold sweating and shaking.  This lasted for an hour.  This all occurred about 4 days ago.  Since then I have been getting these bouts of sweating and fever and feel weak and have some minor aches.  When I exert myself just a bit (a walk down the block for example)
I start sweating excessively and feeling weak and ill but when I just sit at my desk on the computer I feel ok.  Its like as soon as my blood starts pumping I start feeling aches and weakness.  I do have hep-c maybe that has something to do with it...

I spoke to my girlfriend(who also has a past with iv use) about it and she told me to go to the ER.  I don't want to go unless I have to.  Could anyone shed some light on this, or if you have gone through something similar give me some advice?  Can the body just fight this off?

She finds it, a sharp pain as the needle goes in, but it‚Äôs all part of the ritual she has to complete. She admits defeat and pushes the plunger down.
No pain, no cares, no sound. Immediate relief is found, body trembling as the pins and needles go up and down and she‚Äôs finally happy.
She knows it‚Äôs momentary but nothing else matters, her fears and worries have shattered, thoughts fleeting and scattered but that‚Äôs how she likes it.

She closes her eyes and the blackness, the silence becomes real.

8o561i,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8o561i/your_iv_horror_stories/,30,https://redd.it/8o561i,NotJenna1,Your IV Horror Stories,"i was having this conversation with my dealer earlier today, and it was actually a really interesting, albeit terrifying, conversation between us. i've never actually posted in the forum before, i'm more of a lurker, but i thought this thread might actually start some interesting conversations/stories.

so i'll start. prior to this, i hadn't had any IVing horror stories, because i might be a junkie, but i was always a clean, smart one. always bought new rigs, only used each one about 2-3 times and then threw it away, and i always made sure everything was clean and sanitized. but then one night, right around this time last year, one of my best friends and i were staying up all night, shooting a TON of fent -- before anyone starts in on me, YES, i know how insanely dangerous IVing fent is, because even if you're off by just a tiny, tiny microgram, you could very easily OD, and not to defend myself for my stupidity, but i wasn't doing it alone, and i'm always stocked up with narcan in the event anything should ever happen (thank you, god, it never has).

anyway, the rig i was using, i had been using all night because i was down to my last one and no pharmacies around me are open at 2 am. so i stuck the needle into my arm, and when i went to pull it out... the entire needle was missing and stuck in my arm. i was hitting the vein right in the crook of my elbow, so when i freaked out and bent my arm, it pushed the metal deeper into my skin and i couldn't get it out. i was LOSING MY MIND. my friend helped me try to get it out, but it was so deeply in there, and if i remember correctly, it was underneath the vein, so there was no getting to it.

i knew i couldn't go through my life with this piece of metal stuck in my arm. i could get a horrible infection, not to mention that every time i bent my elbow, the needle dug deeper into my arm and was EXTREMELY painful. so what did i do? well, i had to go to the ER and tell them i was an IV opiate addict and that a needle had snapped off in my arm. luckily, in the haze of fentanyl and the pain of a needle digging into my arm, my friend and i were smart enough to take the ferry over to the next state and go to the ER there. i'm not dumb (well, i am, if you only know me through this story), i knew if i went to my hometown ER, i would instantly be put on the blacklist for painkillers, because they'd know i was an addict and they'd consider me a drug seeker. it was a rather smart decision, because since then i've had to go to my hometown ER when i broke my finger at work, and thank you god, i was not blacklisted there, so they were quick with handing out the IV dilaudid while i was in the ER, and then sent me home with 7.5 mg percocets, as well. anyway, i digress.

long story short, the needle had moved underneath the vein in my arm and couldn't be reached without a surgeon cutting my arm open. so they numbed me up, sliced into my arm, pulled the broken needle out, stitched me up, and sent me on my way... with no painkillers, even though my arm was profusely bleeding still and i was in a lot of pain. because every time i had moved my arm, the needle was stabbing the muscle that it was sitting on top of. so it was LEGITIMATELY painful and they definitely would have sent anyone else home with painkillers, but not this guy, because they knew i was an opiate addict. so they kicked me some extra strength ibuprofen and home i went.

so there you go, that's MY IV horror story. what are yours? :) ",1527988693.0

I had called everyone I know who sells pills and felt like such shit lol, anxiety was kicking my ass and I didn't sleep last night. Husband decided to ask one of his workers for me, since we knew his mom had just had surgery, and she likes husband for giving her son a job, since a lot of people won't give him a chance (psych background, but eager to please, sweet as can be and a helluva worker). She couldn't get rid of them all since she just had surgery, but she parted with 25 of them for $40 (we just let them keep the change from $40 since it was like $2.50, and we're the ones getting a deal).

Now I can play the waiting game without anxiety and not feel so shitty while I wait for either this really flaky guy to come through (he quit answering Facebook messages üñïüèªüñïüèªüñïüèª), or for my regular ""middle"" lady to call back... I can't understand why it's so freakin dry around here, I thought a lot of people get prescriptions near the first lol.

Question about ""middles""... My regular lady charges a ""finders fee"" which really pisses my husband off. It's normal, isn't it?!?! Like, I wouldn't expect her to take time out of her day to make phone calls and all that for nothing! Husband said she's upcharging us for pills already and then to add a fee on top of it is ridiculous. I think it's normal and it's honestly how she makes her money, like she doesn't have a job or anything. And, when they are her pills, she doesn't charge the fee. Husband thinks I am naive, I think I'm super realistic lol. Just wanted to see what you guys thought! üòäüòä

But, which opioids did you try with this ROA? I did plently of O\-DSMT, Heroin and Moprhin with this ROA and it was really a great feeling. not as good as shooting it up, but much more safely as banging. The rush is nice and comes within a couple minutes and also, the bioavailability is much higher. for example heroin: its about 30\-40&#37; smoking, 80&#37; snorting and about 100&#37; injecting. i'd guess rectally injection is about 85\-100&#37;.  


share your experience. \(which opioid, ROA, feeling compared to other ROAS\)

I'm not really sure how to feel, but whenever I do feel something, I sure as shit will be high for it.","Alright so I've been a lurker and occasional poster on here for years. This is a new username though because I ""unremembered"" my password for my older one and also, I kinda wanted to make a throwaway for this story anyhow. 

Besides cold copping adventures, my favorite type of stories to read on here are the ones where people talk about all the random ways they've hustled up the day's dope money. I know many people on this sub hold down full-time jobs, so this may not always apply to everyone, but regardless, I think we can all appreciate the unique ways us kinda folk often resort to in order to come up with some cold, hard cash. I never had anything worth posting about. I feel like I do now.

My boy came over yesterday morning to chill and shoot the shit. He also deals a little crys on the side for some extra dope income, so we were doing some hot rails (my first time, HOLY SHIT) and as often the case with speed, the conversation was flowing. Here's where I make note of the relevant fact that my buddy is bi-sexual. He somehow gets into telling me all about his random hookups, mostly all of them made possible thanks to the grindr app. As fate would have it, right that moment, he gets a text from one of his grindr hookups and proceeds to tell me about their ""relationship""...

Basically, he meets this dude usually once a week at the local porn shop. He's an older, married guy who likes to get groped in public. So they go into the back part of the porn shop where they have the little theaters with porn playing and also these tiny private rooms. My buddy will grope his package out in the open a few times and then go into a private room and help him finish. Dude pays him $200 every time for this.

I'm hearing this and can't help but think to myself ""Damn, I won't lie, if I was bi or gay, I'd be all over this"". Then, the wheels in my brain start turning and now I'm trying to think how I could possibly get involved in this ""deal"" without doing anything I don't want to do or feel comfortable doing. If it wasn't for the speed, I don't think I ever would have gotten on this line of thinking, but I digress.  All I knew was that within the next 12-24 hours, I'd be coming down from the speed and craving dope. But, I was broke and dopeless. That being said, naturally, I laid out my idea to my buddy to hear his thoughts.

I am 100% straight and completely comfortable with my sexuality. I really don't think anything I would do or say would really make me question that, so maybe that's why I was willing to participate. With that said, I still did not want to blow or jerk off or really have much of any physical contact with this random old dude. So I suggested to my buddy, to suggest to this guy, that I come with, rub up against this dude's shit outside his pants, and then just watch the rest of it go down. Since he's into voyeurism and all or whatever. As luck would have it, my physical description, and the fact that I'm a straight dude, is right up this guy's alley and he's IN. He comes out and offers us $600 cash for our time. So $300 each. Morals be damned, I couldn't turn it down.

I'm not gonna go into major detail about the actual events, because it wasn't all that exciting and I've already written half a book. But yeah. We went. At first, it was super fucking weird for me but I just kept thinking how I just need to push through for the $300 at the end. 

Well, this shit ended up being a breeze. Here was my ""participation""....I literally brushed up against this guys junk on two separate occasions. Didn't touch anything directly really. Total of about 45 seconds. Then the rest of the time I ""watched"" those two do whatever they did and had my hand in my pants, but I was really just watching porn on my phone of some hot teens with big tits. Still couldn't get hard though.

The whole thing lasted 15-20 minutes tops. Guy discreetly gave us the $600 cash and we got out of there and went back home. Made it back home within the hour. And we were each $300 richer. I immediately hit up the dopeman for 2 bundles and all in all....I was a happy camper.

Am I proud of it? Not really. But shit, I didn't cross any of my personal boundaries and it was hands down the easiest, quickest $300 of my life. ",1527950542.0

My physical symptoms: My face went completely numb, my vision went blurry, I had the worst ringing in my ears that you can ever imagine, to the point that I couldn‚Äôt hear anything else. My head felt like someone was hitting it with a hammer, my heart felt like it was going to beat out of my chest and I felt like I was having the worst anxiety attack ever, maybe close to having a heart attack. I fell to the floor panicking while my girlfriend held me down and tried to calm me down for what felt like 15 mins but she said it only lasted 5 mins. The next 30 mins after that I had low auditory ringing and a nasty headache that‚Äôs slowly started to decline in intensity.

The mental symptoms I experienced were even worse, I really thought I was going to die which made my anxiety unbearable. I had visual and auditory hallucinations like seeing shadow people, intense visual snow, and hearing whispers. I thought I was going to be fucked up forever. 

Can someone please tell me if I should call 911 or go to a doctor tomorrow? I‚Äôm still having extreme anxiety and my chest and left arm are still numb from the experience. My heartbeat has slowly gotten better but it‚Äôs still going a million miles a minute and it‚Äôs been about an hour from the incident as I type this.

Also do undercovers have long hair ever? Or beards?","So this morning I went to go cop, at like 2 am. I got my shit and  I'm sitting  in the same parking spot of the apartment complex I copped at prepping my speedball. So I blast off and decide I wanted to have just some coke in my next shot since ther wasn't enough in the first one. So I'm makling this shot and some spills out of the bag onto my passanger seat and I'm cleaning up etc. This is all  taking time and at some point I see a white guy with a longish hair  he's beard thats tatted up with long hair and dressed kinda fantsy like, He's a few cars down but I'm fairly certain he can't see my rig or anything. But if he looked into my car he would've seen me and the street lamp probbably gave him enough light to see a young, well dressed, clean cut white kid who doesn't belong in the City named after an Indian, and who probbably lives in one of the nicer white towns a bit up north. So anyways I see him run from his car to what appears to be an apartment. I didn't look too long though so I didnt see exactly where he ran too. He comes back a minute or 2 later with a cigarette in mouth and gets into his car. So while all this is going on I'm looking for my rig in my car and can't find it so I open the door and step out to get a better view. The boy bagy was in my door and the wind took it out which blows massive donkey dicks. So I look for my phone and decide I want to start looking for the bagy and my shot can wait. I'm also barefoot which I'm sure looks sketchy as fuck. So I step lut onto the parking area and start scanning with my phone but obly to no avail. I quickly noticed 2 cars which looked to be the county sherrifs  sitting in the road with their lights pointed at the row of cars I'm in. I tried not to look like I was poanicking and running away so I continued my search acting like I belonged there and was looking for something I dropped. Then I turned around and walked like 3 to 4 feet back to my car to try and clean everything up. There was some coke on my seat  and the passanger seat,  freshly  used rig, and credit card with white powder on it. I scambled to get everything as clean as possible before they come over to where I'm at wich is probbably going to be impossible. Lucky for me they probbably had some serious call going on since they  just  drove  past me  and  a few minutes later I hear their sirens go off. So basically I think the white guy from earlier is infact an undercover since he was wite, fit, young, and dressed well. He ran out saw me in my car, rand back in and left and called his buddies in, who pulled up a decent amount away from me, but I'm sure they were looking directly at my head, wondering what I was doing. They were most likely looking for a reason to stop me and question me but sat there for a few minutes since Iwasn't doing anything they could stop me for. Or I'm overthinking it and the 2 of them might've just been on patrol in the same complex in 2 different cars.

8nz711,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8nz711/chronic_pain_tightrope/,5,https://redd.it/8nz711,life_wasted_again,Chronic Pain Tight-Rope,"I'm gonna preface this post by saying that yes I'm aware that this isn't /r/chronicpain, but I feel as if this is the community this post truly belongs in. I want to start by giving a bit of vague backstory about myself and my experience with chronic pain from an early age, alongside anxiety and occasional depression.

Well, the first drug that I ever took was half of a .25mg Xanax that was given to me by a parent, but although I only had this one experience, it seemed to have opened the gates in my mind to a certain curious fascination with achieving an altered state of consciousness. This began my journey into not only wanting to try most drugs, but ALL of the drugs because I thought that it would give me some enhanced perspective, or something naive like that.

Anyway, I first ran into hydros towards the middle of my freshman year in highschool, but I wouldn't be able to get hydros here and there on a regular basis (if I wanted them: I found that they helped me socialize, alleviated anxiety, turned me into the class pet, and also nullified the back pain that I had started to notice once in a while... more about this later.) I never became dependent on pills in school, despite having the resources to, I managed to get a grip on that.

For me, the real trouble started when I turned to taking kratom in heaping piles using the toss and wash method, the trouble wasn't the kratom however, it was the dosage. I was taking absurd amounts, dosing 4-5x a day just to fend off bone-chilling shivers towards the very end. At first, with any opioids, I had that same alleviation of anxiety and an energizing feeling of passion and attention to detail in things I would do in day to day life. I've been moderately dependent on some ""legally"" acquired hydromorphone (4-8mg rectal/day), morphine (75mg+/day), even hydrocodone and oxycodone. My kratom habit became horrendous by the very end of my sophomore year, so my pediatrician referred me to an addiction counselor who after trying to taper me off slowly, decided that it would be best to cold-turkey me. He had my pediatrician write me a script for 10 days of comfort meds: 1mg of Ativan 4x a day in someone who had never been prescribed benzos before. I felt as if I was being truly crucified for the first two days and hardly even had enough energy to eat, though the Ativan still didn't take away the restlessness in my arms or legs. Part of me began to wonder if I was simply returning to normal, or if something was wrong with me, as the pain in my shoulders and back came back full force.

Well, as healthcare in the US would have it, my pediatrician's next step was to refer my dumb ass to a psychiatrist who, after seeing me twice, started me on a healthy dose of Klonopin daily (as well as writing scripts for any stimulant I wanted, because I guess the narcolepsy I was having from her initial script for Ativan made me qualify for having ADD on her survey.) Unequivocally, starting daily Klonopin has been the single worst decision I've ever made in my life, but I digress. Still, despite having resolved my anxiety issue now by turning myself into an absurdly over-medicated freak, I was having this terrible back pain that I had noticed during my physical in my freshman year, but attributed to wearing a backpack that day.

I'll spare you my life story, but after seeing the same pediatrician almost weekly because of unbearable muscle and joint pain, I was told that it was just ""growing pains"" after having a whole blood test and X-rays done. At this point, I think a lot of people can relate, after hearing the same ""Oh you're just looking for pain pills"" thing from literally everyone: family, friends, doctors... you really start to believe it.

Fast forward to freshman year of college and I see a new primary care doc after I turn 18 who, after doing one test, refers me to a rheumatologist. She tells me that she didn't even have to see me to tell me what I had, the blood work and X-rays were telling enough. She diagnosed me with an autoimmune disease called ankylosing spondylitis, a degenerative inflammatory arthritis primarily affecting the spine (basically, the discs become damaged and then fuse the vertebrae together over time). Since being diagnosed, and still having flares of excruciating pain (despite being on a biologic that I have to stick myself with every week that costs my insurance company ~$5k/mo), my primary tells me that ""We don't want to start narcotics, because you always have to increase the dose"" or ""We don't want to start narcotics considering your age.""

I've never asked him for a narcotic, I've only repeated the truth: I'm fucking sick of taking 800mg of Advil 3 times a day with a Tylenol or two alongside it just to be able to leave my house. A huge part of dealing with chronic pain is acceptance, yes, but this guy won't even give me 10 Tylenol 3s... I'm at a fucking loss lol.

Sorry for rambling and shit, it's early but I cant sleep because it's raining and my neck feels ready to pop. I just want to hear about other people's experiences with similar things or recommendations as far as getting either the help I need or the help I think I need.

This is when I was 15 or so. Anyway, one of our cats, a pretty orange and white baby girl named Cinnamon, became a little junkie kitty without us realizing.

My mom was prescribed Fentanyl patches. It was summer time, and they made her sweat a lot. Cinnamon always love to giving kisses, she would lick everybody all over. She where to cling to my mom a lot and lick her extensively, but it was nothing out of the ordinary initially. But then she started acting weird. She would bolt over and start to attack my mom if she didn't let her lick the sweat off of her. She would start acting really funny, throw up, they really fussy and aggressive which was completely out of character for her. We realized that cinnamon had been licking the fent that was in my mom's sweat and got addicted to it. Homegirl was in fentanyl withdrawal. In retrospect that is hysterical that I saw my God damn cat get dope sick from being a little junkie fiend fent licjer.  My mom had to wean her off, let her lick little bits at a time for less and less cutting her down every few days.

Cinnamon ultimately recovered from her addiction. It was fucking hilarious when we realized what was happening. See, I'm totally predisposed... Even my goddamn cat was a junkie! Anyway, just wanted to share with you all this random memory that popped into my mind and made me giggle. ",1527917831.0

Her fingers outline the mirror, depiction of a monster

A portrayal not her own but made a reality by the ghosts that haunt her past

Inside she proves the only is constant is change

Her views of the world; crystal clear

A walking shell, skeleton of the life once held so dear

The beginning of the end; our suicide

Attempt at redemption; atleast know I tried

There is only so much one can take

Despite how long, she will not break

Her good judgement of character sodomized by the broomstick of society

Who teaches her to contradict everything she believes

""Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind""

She now assumes the portrait of a common fairy

Predicting death to all who cross her path

Thoughts of her own, the last of her kind

This dead flesh body will eventually decay

At last she'll be free on this dying day

These days are numbers as her soul fades away

Rekindle the flame of her burning desires

Like the kerosene lies that fuel lovers fires

The blackened lungs of a pathological liar

The attention whore with needs so dire

The track marked beauty queen who just wants to get higher

A bathtub littered with electrical wire

The lifeless corpse still waiting on it's pyre

Uncorrupted youth's eyes ceasing to tire

Like atheists serenading the sacred choir

Her breath dies out with the greatest of ease 

Smooth stained glass seas

Wind humming verses of the slightest breeze

Slowly combing the ancient primordial trees

She calmly falls to her knees

8nyaaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8nyaaz/story_about_stuff/,9,https://redd.it/8nyaaz,dopeandsmokes,Story about stuff,"Hey dudes. This isn‚Äôt related to opiates really.. but I love this community and this is a story I can‚Äôt really share with folks in my day to day life, you‚Äôll see why If you keep reading... I‚Äôm stoned as hell on oxy‚Äôs right now... and this story is about  something that‚Äôs weighed heavily on me for years and honestly I just want to tell it to someone. 

When I was in my late teens early twenties I used to sell a lot of weed. Not just here and there.. I was obsessed w it - good at it to.  

My connection and I became very close over the years we were good friends. We accomplished a lot together. Until one day, and to this day I don‚Äôt have a good reason for doing this. I decided to screw this cat over. I lied to him and told him I was robbed of our stash and basically he was fucked out of a lot of money. 

Obviously he was devastated, and I stuck to the script and apologized and lied again and basically said I‚Äôd pay him back over time..,. Well, a few weeks later my house was raided by the cops looking for weed. I never figured out exactly why but I think it had something to w someone else who was sort of an enemy of mine/ competition at the time. 

After that I basically told the dude that ya, I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm not gonna be doing this stuff anymore and ur SOL about the money. Sent him a pic of the warrant and never heard from the dude again. 

Also! Cops didn‚Äôt find shit I had just stolen tons of money why would I be selling weed?? Hah! They were late to the party. 

Anyways.. I‚Äôve thought about my old connection/friend, literally every single day since the day I fucked him over. I‚Äôve lost sleep over it, it was the heaviest guilt I ever carried about anything I truly felt horrible about it and the thing is.. I didn‚Äôt even have a good reason to rob him.. that‚Äôs what killed me. I did it for seriously no good reason. Which, I guess you guys will have to take my word for it on this one.. but it wasn‚Äôt a good representation of who I am as a person. I don‚Äôt do things like that. So it was something that weighed heavily in me for many years. 

Flash forward a few years. I haven‚Äôt sold a drug since the day I took the money. I‚Äôve focused very much on my career.. and I fucking love opiates which lead me to this fantastic community. 

Last week I looked up my old friend. I reached out to him. I told him what had happened back in the day, and told him i wanted it make it right. He was... suspicious to say the least. But we did end up meeting, and I paid him back every single dollar plus some.. I don‚Äôt want to say the exact figure but it was 5 digits. 

It was an incredible moment for us both. We then reminisced over old times, and really enjoyed catching up. 

Right before we parted ways he asked what made me want to do this... the answer was that he was my friend, someone who never did anything to deserve what I did to him. And I didn‚Äôt want to carry the guilt w me anymore, and honestly because I didn‚Äôt want it out in the universe anymore. 

About a week has passed and I feel completely liberated. 


Sorry for the off topic post.. I just don‚Äôt have anyone else I can really share this w. And thought y‚Äôall might enjoy a wholesome story about some good o‚Äôl fashion game shit. 

Happy nods y‚Äôall!

But lately it's not an escape, it's just an invitation to deal with more bullshit that wouldn't be there if it wasn't for the dope. 
We've been together for a long time and we both have habits, and both of us have expressed interest in cleaning up and regaining our lives, or at least some semblance of normal lives. Had a chance at the first of the week, but just had to have another go around. 
But lately our 'escape ', our buzz, consists of me watching her nod out while sitting or standing,  and trying to keep her from hurting herself, or burning or breaking something. But in her eyes, I'm not doing that. Instead I'm hovering over her and bitching. And when she's in this shape it's obviously the perfect time to go wandering around outside or thru the building. We're essentially squatting at night, so lights and noises have to be kept to bare minimum,  absolute necessity. Unless you're on the nod, can't walk or maintain a grip on anything,  so you're constantly dropping everything, sounds like an excellent opportunity to explore doesn't it ? But other than that, you're good, why not go wandering around, except for the part where we have absolutely nowhere left to go. 

So yeah, that's what evidently is passing for a buzz and a good time right now. And we're paying thru the nose for the experience (No pun intended). Anybody else going thru that, or been thru it already? Sorry for the rant but it's killing us and had to let go of it. ",1527910469.0

It took me a minute before I realized my cats had the itch like crazy, and we've all been there just itchy all over and wanting nothing more then to scratch it, only she couldnt scratch it because of her bandages.

I have been an infrequent user of opiates in the past but decided to cut them out completely once I felt myself to drawn to them. I have a friend however who started at the same time as me who unfortunately did not stop. 
I'm really worried about him. His use is aggravating and he just started injecting. I really think I might find him dead in his room one day. 
I tried to get him into a clinic but he's too stubborn. He says he's still got it together. Which he kinda does. He is still very productive. Maybe even more productive than he was before his habit.
My question is if someone has got any experience with getting naloxone injections from a doctor in Belgium. 
I'd like to have these just in case I might find him unconscious on the floor. ",1527891803.0

Fast forward to now my friend was prescribed 30mg oxys and asked me if I wanted to buy a couple, so I did. I ended up taking half and I felt nowhere near the level of euphoria I got from the percs a couple of years back. I felt a very slight sense of warmth and well being, but it also made me itch like crazy and was in a bad mood for most of the ""high.""

I decided to take a whole pill a few days later, but felt the exact same thing as the first time, except even more of a bad mood and more itching. For $30 a pop I determined that these things are definitely not worth it and ended up selling the rest. I guess it's a blessing in disguise because I have heard how addictive these things can be. Basically my question is that is it really possible that once you try them, the feeling you get from the first time will never be the same in the future once you try again? I figured since it has been years and I had no tolerance I would've felt something at least somewhat close to when I tried them the first time.   ",1527890306.0

8nvmca,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8nvmca/should_i_stop_taking_buprenorphine/,5,https://redd.it/8nvmca,Minuted,Should I stop taking buprenorphine?,"Hi all.

Used to lurk here a lot and post from time to time.

I got on subs Febuary last year, after a few attempts at getting on them and falling off the wagon. I started at 4mg and have very slowly reduced to the 0.8mg a day I'm taking now.

So being the incurable dickhead that I am I've been messing around with my daily dose. I quite often snort my dose. Once a week, but sometimes more often. Recently I've been craving stronger opiates, and I can't help but wonder if the buprenorphine has become something of an addiction in itself.

Buprenorphine has helped me tremendously and I'm 100% not against maintenance. But in truth I was in such a bad way when I hit my bottom when I was using that going cold turkey was not something I seriously considered. I was so depressed I was nearly suicidal so I figured it'd be best to get on subs and sort my life out. Slowly that has happened. I started taking an anti-depressant recently, and it's the first one I've tried that actually helps without causing me to feel it helps too much or has horrible side effects. Since then I've made strides towards getting my life back on track. I'm not quite there but I'm in better shape than I have been since before I even started using, so 5/6 years.

I'm not sure if it'd be best to stop taking the buprenorphine and go cold turkey to try to get over my need to take opiates to feel ok. Maybe I'm at such a low dose it's natural for my body to crave opiates somewhat.

My keyworker said that it's up to me, and if I did want to jump off the doctor could prescribe something to help with the withdrawal symptoms (I'm guessing something like Clonidine and maybe something to help me sleep?). I'm hesitant to mention that I've been abusing the buprenorphine I'm prescribed, I'm not sure if I'd get in trouble and have my support withdrawn. The past 4 months or so I've made numerous attempts to take less than the dose I'm prescribed and all of my attempts end at day 3 or 4 at the max. It's not even that the withdrawals are that bad but just having the buprenorphine there it's too tempting to just snort some for that measly but real ""high"". It's stupid.

Any advice? Has anyone here jumped from the 0.8mg/1mg range before? How was it? Anyone from the UK had much experience with CGL (https://www.changegrowlive.org (not sure if links are allowed but will delete if not))? I'm not sure if I should be honest with my keyworker about how I've been feeling and acting with the subs.

If I'm honest I want to be off them so I'm leaning towards stopping, even if the idea of living without any opiates for the first time in years is scary. But would be good to hear some opinions. 

Thanks.",1527888372.0

2 days ago I started MMT, My starting dose was 30mg. About an hour and a half after my dose I blacked\-out while in my car, I was able to pull over just before it happened and didn't wreck. Someone found me in my car passed out and breathing very shallow and called am ambulance. They checked me out and my 02 levels and blood pressure and all were fine. I told my doctor at the clinic about this and the next day I went to dose \(scared af\) and they gave me 20mg. Well it fucking happened again, this time at work. And it seemed like it was so hard to catch my breath. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or the methadone, but I went back to the clinic today and refused my dose and talked to the Doc again. Tomorrow we are reducing my dose to 10mg, but honestly I don't even want to go. Has anyone experienced black\-outs, and i mean blacking out, not nodding off, from methadone?

Thanks

This shed has a bunch of cameras on every corner outside hooked up to a TV inside and my buddy saw him walking down the alley.  Well, this guy had owed my buddy $180 for over a week now and has been ducking and dodging him and buying dope a few streets down instead of going to him and squaring up.

My buddy instantly jumps up and runs outside to chase him down.  When he catches up to him he's all, like, ""YOU GOT MY MONEY??!"" and the guy was obviously high as fuck.

What happened next was so savage it blew my mind.  Two enforcers that stay up at the trap hold this guy down while my homeboy walks back to the shed and emerges about a minute later with a syringe and a vial of Narcan.

He draws up a big dose of it into the rig and injects this guy with a huge shot of Narcan which almost immediately sent him into severe precipitated withdrawals (this guy was so high, he was nodding while walking, looked like the walking dead).

The guy starts dry heaving and yelling and then began to puke.  Then the two big black enforcer guys begin beating the shit out of this dude and knock him out.

One guy punched him so hard he was unconscious before he hit the ground.

That's some crazy shit, injecting someone with Narcan to send them into withdrawals because of a debt.  It's dangerous out here on these streets.

The ""10"" in the pic online is closer together than in my pills. I only have found 1 picture online of this specific pill. I'm not sure if it's new pills. The reason I have to think it's real is because it sparkles inside. Can they simulate that with pressed pills?  Does anyone get this specific pill from the pharmacy? Any help is appreciated.

It was my first offense (one 3rd degree and a couple 4th degree indictable offenses aka felonies) so I was eligible for PTI (pre-trial intervention for those who haven‚Äôt been a junkie long enough to finally get caught up in the legal system...keep using...you will...we all do eventually, unfortunately).

Originally was given 1 year but kept failing drug tests and was assigned an additional year.  Finally got myself into an outpatient program, which I completed successfully.  Though around month 14 I caught a heroin possession & paraphernalia charge...which in my state (NJ) is a 4th degree felony, though since our legal system is rammed full of heroin addicts it was remanded down to municipal court and I had it reduced to a simple Wandering charge.  Since both failing drug tests and getting arrested violates the terms of my PTI, I was very uncertain of my future...but it seems that since I was truly struggling, and got my shit together, completed a program, and stopped failing drug tests, my PO recommended my charges be dismissed.

I literally cried with happiness, as having a possible 5 years in prison hanging over your head is a miserable feeling and has definitely been keeping me coming back for more.

I‚Äôm going to take this second chance and run hard with it.  I was so lucky to have this outcome, I don‚Äôt want to ruin it...I could have just as easily been on my way to prison.

The ones you could lick the coating off and crush for insufalation.  Story about these.  I used to be able to get them for free everyday for over 2 years.  Before them I had only used Norco 10s.  Well when I went to check the stash I pulled out a bottle and first thing I read was oxy and I almost shit myself because I was 14 and did not know what oxys were.  I instantly sold some because I didnt know anything about them and didnt realize how much they sold for so I was selling them for same price of Norcos.  After about a month I got curious.  I was like I bet this will be like norco so I took 3 and went on a run to pick up bud with my cousin.  Things started to get odd and I wanted a cig and Ive never smoked in my life.  I get to the dealers house and his gf comes and looks at me and says are you ok? your pale white sweating, and shivering.  I was confused then I told them what I did and they all had a chuckle and made me dinner, and helped me stay awake and hydrated cause I think I may had been on the verge of an OD.  this was the first ever time I took OC and i only had about a month of taking 3 norco 10 daily so tolerance was low.  Fast forward 4 months, Its almost halloween so I stocked up on my free merchendise and had 4 OC 30s all coating off ready to be busted down to snort when my mother decided to clean my room and she found all my party favors.  She freaked out and I convinced her they were the pills she gave me the past few months and somehow she gave them all back.  Fearing that she would smarten up and realize they were ones she gave me, I instantly busted down all 4 30s and made about 12 beautiful lines.  I really love the taste and feel of the 30s.  They were strong enough, Lasted awhile, and made me feel like superman.  Well I railed all 4 30s in less than 4 hours and had a very rough time with chest pain, passing out, and other stuff.  I really think that I came close to ODing that day.

One more story.  I got ahold of a high mcg gel Fentenyl patch.  I bought the whole patch for 40 bucks and instantly went home and cleaned my man cave preparing for hybernation.  I had never had a gel patch before so I had to google how to use it and smoking was the method I seen the most.  I ended up smoking a few hits every hour hour for a week or two.  I was cold sweating, brain messed up, seeing shit, and hardcore nodding for a whole week. This was a blessing that I didnt die during this week long sesh.  Not saying Id never do patches again. I would just use my hash Dab rig and be sparingly and make someone be with me so I dont chronically redone and die.  

Thats the end of my stories.  sorry for the rambling.  I havent slept tonight and I am bored and have a good day! or night

That's when I said enough was enough. I stopped for years and never got the urge for more. I get my monthly vicodin prescription (for last 2 years as scar tissue has buit around spinal cord)but don't abuse like I used to.

My question is..did you get hooked on pills? And aren't you guys afraid of dying from heroin laced with fentanyl? I live in MA and the northeast's younger generation is being killed off due to this stuff up here. Every day you see an ambulance near my appt reviving someone...or a huge bust on the highway going to Maine with loads and loads of heroin and fentanyl headed to NH and Maine. It's sad and I am just curious as if you guys are afraid of dying or...no? Just curious as it's sad that I know at least 5 people from my HS and 10 from college now dead from this stuff..people you never would think would be doing this kind of stuff.

I've had my issues in the past and luckily I now have self control. Just curious about your story is all

I was diagnosed with a bacterial infection that is causing me major neck stiffness and pain.  The ER doc did not prescribe me the needed dose of antibiotics because the bloodwork was going to take a few days and he wanted to be conservative in prescribing anything.  The bloodwork came back positive.  So, I will be talking to him again tomorrow or next week and asking for more antibiotics.

This neck pain is debilitating to the point where I am on the verge of copping dope to help, which I don't want to do.  I need to prepare for the internship and it's just not happening.  I am assuming that I am red flagged as a pain med seeker, as I have been to the ER for an overdose in the past and due to the fact that my PCP knows about my opiate addiction history unfortunately.

I want to ask the doc for pain meds during the next conversation.  How do I approach this?  Be polite and ask when I ask for more antibiotics?  Or is there simply no way, no point in trying?",1527813687.0

But, I realize it was not you who turned from a whole human being to an infinity of scattered remains blowing away in the wind. That was me. 

Now that I‚Äôve spent some time away, I can clearly see you for what you really are. You served a purpose, and you served it well, especially in our first months together. You gave me strength and liberated me from my own negativity and personal traumas. You were not the problem. I was the problem. Because I did not realize that this strength and liberation was never meant to last forever. 

The moment I found you, I knew my only goal was to know every corner of your experience. I was aware of where that would lead me, but I didn‚Äôt care, not one single bit, because all I wanted was to leave the world behind and snuggle tightly into your embrace; all my issues turned non-issues; all my fears dissolved; all my insecurities nowhere to be found. But only for a while. Quickly came your wrath. The sickness, the hollowness, the complete and utter lack of human life. I blamed it all on you. ‚ÄúYou did this to me, you made me this way, if only I could just have more of you, none of this would be happening.‚Äù I was so silly. For every finger I pointed at you, three more were pointed back at me. You were only doing your job, a job that I had assigned to you. 

In many aspects, our time together has taught me so much about myself, about life. But your most valuable lesson to me was this:

Nothing in this life can bring you everlasting happiness, but only because it is already inside you.

Today, I sincerely say thank you for what you have shown me and where you have led me, because without this sorrowful adventure I would not be half the man I am today. No more resentments. No more anger. I am exactly where I need to be, and you will always be part of that. However, I‚Äôve gotten the message so I have to hang up the phone. You are no longer needed. Goodbye.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

I don‚Äôt really know how long I‚Äôve been off dope but I‚Äôve been having a tough time lately, searching for my own truth and meaning. I found myself thinking a lot about when I was using and how it could be that I felt the best (at times) when my life was at its worst. So I decided to rewrite my goodbye letter. I‚Äôve held many resentments and anger towards myself and heroin but I realized that if I never let those go I can never realize the full value of this life experience. Just thought I‚Äôd share it.

So, here's the scoop. I did drugs for a long tine, got clean, did more drugs, got clean etc. This most recent time I had a year clean, and was making real good progress. Around my year mark, I had dental surgery to fix my drug diseased teeth, and they gave me percs, and instead of being a responsible person and having someone hold onto them for me, I took them all. Now, it's been about 3 weeks of doing blues everyday. (I did dope the one day but it was too strong for my tolerance and I got sick and hated it) I thought I'd be fine to just stop and I wouldn't get dopesick, cause they're just blues and haven't been using long. But, again, drug addict me is not a smart man. So I want to stop now before it gets worse and I go back to where I used to be in the past. Now, I know you would think a person who's been doing drugs for awhile should deff know how to detox themselves, which for the most part I do. But, usually, I just use until I lose everything I own and til everyone hates me and I have no options left and then I go ti rehab. But this time, I want to detox before all that happens. I can't miss work, and I can't miss school, so my only spare time I have is the weekends. So after that long drawn out wall of text, my question is; What products/methods would you use to help you detox and still go to work/school, and any useful tips you know have helped you?",1527798652.0

I consider myself a decent budgeter. Especially for the junkie I am/can be. Well, last week something debuted my account for an unexpected $200. That took a fat chunk, if not all, of my dope money. I usually get a half a day between my wife and I, and we make it work. Well, this last week that didn‚Äôt work because of the $200. We ran out 3 days early. 

Luckily I have some of the best friends on the planet. My boy, let‚Äôs call him Jay, saved not only me but my wife as well. Jay knew the predicament I was in and came and smoked 2 out of the 3 days we were sick and got us to a functioning point. This guy is already as good to me, if not nicer, than some of my lifelong friends. We only met a few weeks ago! Needless to say him and I vibe and I think I just made another lifelong friend(best part is that we met on here). 

I digress. Wed is payday every week but not this week! Memorial Day fucked that up and I completely missed that it would so wifey and I were sick for even longer than expected. I hit up my d-boy Wednesday night and tell him that my check will be here @ 1am Thursday morning. He says kool and he will see me then. With the way this week was going I don‚Äôt know why I expected my check to be here on time. It hits 1:30 and dboy starts asking where I‚Äôm at. Checks not here yet so I tell him that I‚Äôm still waiting. He ends up calling me at 1:55 to say goodnight. Check posts at 2am..... like fuck man really? 

I‚Äôm up all night because we‚Äôre dopesick and friending and my other friend ends up hitting me up at 4am saying he can pick up. I take an Uber to him, what do you know it double charges me, and he says he will go get me a sack. He leaves and comes back empty handed. Guy wouldn‚Äôt answer the door. This week just gets better and fucking better! Lol. Finally an hour ago my normal dude hits me back so I go up to him. He apologizes as I enter and proceeds to tell me he only has a dub left from last night. I took it needless to say and have begun my journey back.

Now I‚Äôm on my way back to my house dub in hand ready to split it with two other people. Fuck am I tired of this game. Wifey, myself, and Jay are getting out of the game. We are all tired of all this bullshit. This week just exacerbated my need to get clean and in the end I‚Äôm actually thankful for the struggle. Sorry for the shit post, sorry for my frantic writing as I‚Äôve been up for 2.5 days, and I hope y‚Äôall are having a better time out there than I am. Someone give me JJ‚Äôs blessings.

Picked up ETH 446 pills about a week ago -- they are small and white... they came from Philly. Ethex Corporation went out of business in 2010-ish, so seeing this imprint raised a flag for me-- enough for me to (finally) buy a fent festing kit.  

Kits arrived 30 mins ago, so I tested the pills and blammo-- popped for fent right away, clear as day.  

*UPDATED: Here's a link to an image of the front/back of the pill plus the fent test strip (one pink line = fentanyl).*  http://imgur.com/bkAc9AA  Sorry the image is upside down, I'm old. üòÅ 

Just to be sure, I tested it using a different method (I bought several types of testing kits because I'm a nerd) and all methods screamed fent. 

Please don't take these pills thinking they're oxy... they have no oxy in them at all.  (I tested for oxy. None showed up.) If you're looking for a fent press, here ya go.

Be safe, all.

I have a close friend who has been clean for a little over a year now. He got all of his probation taken care of, landed a job, and on top of all this, got engaged! His fianc√© is great and was there for him while he was still in the throes of addiction (she drinks but otherwise pretty sober). 

The other day she texted me to tell me that she thinks he is acting weird, and asked me, his best friend, to talk to him and see what's up. I've reached out and he has basically told me shit has been rough but other than that was very vague (been down this road before). He told me he'd call me but hasn't yet, also hasn't picked up when I've called. 

I am pretty prepared for the upcoming conversation and I never judge him, my question is what do I do with this information if he tells me what I think he's going to tell me? Do I let his fianc√© know? Do I let his brother know? Or do I remain to act as the safe haven for his confessions?

Started with hard drugs at 18 and within about 6 months I had tried fentanyl and heroin, among 30+ other hard drugs. Within another 6 months from then I had gone to inpatient, outpatient twice, sober living, and started shooting up heroin. Fast forward another year I finally managed to stop shooting dope and whatever else I could find after my second inpatient rehab, and I now have roughly 6 months clean with one mishap in the first month of recovery. 

I'm craving lately, a lot. I have been through so much misery from just 2-3 years of this already. I don't know how to handle the cravings as they seem to be getting worse. I'm on suboxone, 16mg a day, and I take it fairly responsibly. I don't abuse it. I'm dealing with a felony theft charge that I haven't been officially charged with yet. My court date is June 22nd. It's my first offense. I'm in outpatient treatment and I make it on time every day and take it very seriously. My family is incredible and they know every detail about my addiction. I'm working part time while going to treatment. I got my car back, my life back, a possible girlfriend I care about who is actually NOT an addict for once, I LOVE my job too, I'm great at it.

I want to use so bad. I feel like I'm so close to picking up some h and rigs and shooting up. I think about it daily again, and it wasn't like that for about 3 months. When I first got out of my 30-day treatment this last time, I managed to pick up just once, finish the bag in a day, and not use again. And the fact that I did that once is making me all the more ready to do it again.

I can't stop looking for things to abuse. I daydream every single damn night about pulling up a shot, wiping my arm and putting on the tourniquet, then just pressing down and feeling that warmth. I can't stop thinking about it. It's killing me. I've ruined so much of my life and been so close to death because of this disease already, but I want more.

I'm happy though, I feel happy at least. Things are great and I'm doing EVERYTHING I'm told to do in recovery. Please help. These cravings won't stop and it's been getting worse and worse since roughly one month ago.",1527746066.0

Absolutely has saved my life.,"Feel free to ask anything. I was on the oxy bad for a long time. Up to 240mg a day. Never did heroin regularly, maybe every now and then, always snorted or smoked it, never injected. Was addicted for over 4 years.

Was put on 8mg suboxone for a month then slowly dropped down to where I'm at now, 2mg daily.

The money I've saved. I cant even begin to tell you how much your realize how you were giving your dope man. 

At first I was still really down. Around month 2 is when my motivation came back. Didnt do anything but pop suboxone all day and lay in bed for a good 30 days. Life is getting back into order now, there's a swing to life.

Switched to subutex because it's the same thing but 5x cheaper than suboxone. It costs about $110 for 10 8mg pills which I half out for daily use. Lasts me a good 3 weeks. Spending roughly $2.50 a day to keep me off a $80+ a day habit. One hell of an investment.

I dont even think about opiates anymore. But I must admit, I still *need* subutex. Not in a fiendish or addictive kind of way, it doesn't even get you high, but it helps keep me in drive and not focus at all on actually getting high, if that makes any sense.

One of the best decisions of my life. Guys, it's worth it not being sick every day. Took me 20 minutes of Googling a suboxone doctor, nd believe me, they're everywhere. They're private so they'll never deny you. As long as you can pay them through your insurance or cash, they will help you.

And believe me, I have ZERO insurance and I walked in and out with a prescription for $150 FLAT. Well, these companies will usually give new patients a coupon to try Suboxone or whatever and you get your first supply free. Will cost you $150 flat your first month to get right onto the suboxone program. 

I explain the money detailed, because that was my biggest roadblock when I wanted to quit. I was too lazy to find out the prices for this for someone with no insurance, I just assumed it was expensive and never bothered to even look it up. It really isn't that expensive at all. If you're worried about bot having insurance and think it's going to cost a lot, IT'S NOT!!! I promise you!

I used to visit here all the time. You all kept me happy when I was very lonely and lost. I wish the best for all of you. I know exactly where you are. Much love to you.

Most of the taper programs I read it would say like last dose, and then after 3-4 days since the last dose you then take a another small .25ish mg dose of suboxone again as your last and final. 
Whats the point of this? I mean I'm strong enough not to take it but of course the thought keeps popping into my head if maybe it's supposed to ease it even more. But I guess I'm sacred it would reset everything I just went thru the past 4 days.

I‚Äôve since learned she did this to several other people as well but anyway, I‚Äôm running low on my prescriptions so I make an appointment with the doctor she referred me to and he‚Äôs absolutely horrible! I‚Äôve been without my prescriptions for a week after stretching them for almost two months and he won‚Äôt prescribe me anything at all but you can go in and hear people in the other rooms discussing getting their pain pills and people selling them in the waiting room. The water in the restroom is turned off and every time I‚Äôve been in I‚Äôve had to leave my belongings on the counter and pee in a cup with a nurse with me and leave it on the counter with 20+ other pee cups so it‚Äôs obvious what this guy does. Half the other patients look like they haven‚Äôt had a shower in weeks and only come for their drugs but I go in looking presentable, I was only somewhat presentable yesterday though as I‚Äôve been having intense withdrawals and we know how that feels! But he wouldn‚Äôt even do anything for me to help with withdrawals or to get off pain meds that I legitimately need.

So a couple of years ago, I had a serious car accident and as a result had three operations to 'fix' the damage done to my shattered collar bones. Unfortunately, the surgeon, for lack of a better term, completely botched the operations and I've now been left with two very much abnormal collar bones, along with a lot of pain and nerve\-pain surrounding the area. I take Lyrica for the nerve pain, which is an absolute god\-send, but that isn't what this is about right now.

It's been two years and I've had a steady oxycodone prescription from my very understanding doctor to keep me from hating the inevitable life of pain. However, with my last visit, he said to me that he doesn't consider it wise to keep writing me scripts for the substance, siting obvious addictive properties, etc. I will begrudgingly admit that I am, to a certain extent, physically dependent on opioid pain relief. However, I really am not sure what to do if he isn't going to continue providing me with scripts. Of course, I can overload myself with ibuprofen/voltaren \(doclofernac sodium\) which \*may\* help, but previous experience has shown me that nothing other than oxycodone will touch the pain I feel on a near\-daily basis. 

To preface my question, I have a good and open dialogue with my doctor. He knows that I am responsible, and copiously research any drug before I will ingest it. I live in Australia, where alternatives such as Kratom are illegal. Does anybody have any ideas as to how I can explain to my doctor that I'm not sure that I can get by without opioid pain relief? I don't want to have to resort to buying them from the dark\-net \(I don't even know how to do that that\). Alternatively, does anybody have any ideas as to alternative pain relief I could try?

I used to take hydrocodone all the time and it would make me wonderfully happy and whatnot, but recently every time I take hydrocodone (and this is ONLY specific to hydrocodone) I find myself easily set off.

Now I know I didn't give much background here, but my hydro use has been infrequent and despite taking 5-10mg once a day, every day (a ridiculously small dose compared to a rec dose üòâ) for a few months, that daily usage has ceased for a while (it's been 2-3 months) so I know that this probably isn't a matter of tolerance.

Oxycodone still makes me feel great, sociable, awake, and impossible to piss off, although hydro was always my DOC and I've never used oxy the same way I've used hydros; my oxy use has been pretty much restricted to recreational use maybe once or twice a month, as I've accepted the reality that opioids are now a treat due to their rarity and I might as well enjoy my pain relief üòä (and oddly, oxy never does shit for my pain unless I do take a rec dose of 20-30mg).

TLDR: Hydrocodone used to make me feel happy, but now I just get pissed off every time I take it, though oxycodone/other opioids don't seem to set me off like this.

I mixed in about a point  .1 to .15 out of my baggie of shards  with my .25 black shot (fire tar) and gave it a feathery kiss with my Bic. I then stirred it up and plopped a bit o' cotton into the nourishing stew residing in my cooker. After lamenting my lack of cleanz i drew up the concoction and tied off. Tap tap with my pointer finger and I found an eager and plump little vein on the upper outer portion of the crook in my elbow. 

I proceeded to slip the instrument of my ...relief/ bondage/wellness/servitude/ fleeting moment of joy and contentment ... beneath my skin and smoothly  (luckily) into the vein. Draw back..""Mmm yea positive register"" ... blood mingles with joy juice ....I slowly yet steadily depress the plunger to the halfway point ...dally ..for a split portion of a second and continue pushing that shit into my holy vessle ..slowly.. as I feel the rush pounding its way into my cerebellum .. chugga chuggchugga like a locomotive. cresting an airy peak picking up steam on its downward trek. 

With this dope quarter gram is decent enough that I take it slow just in case.

..Elevator straight into my skull...my.blood carries the magic potion to my soul. ...finish my shot gently disengage like a post-coital scenario.


FUCKING WHAM WHAM wham WHAM.  HELLOOOO...from the tips of my toes past my prick to my nose and up to the roots from whence my hair grows ....tingle tingle pins n needles ...cold fire rushes like my.blood to every corner of my flesh....DING -a- RING-a-ding-ding-ding-A- BING!!!

I've been invited to sit down with some local lawmakers, politicians, judges, and politicians to discuss the *(God, I hate this term)* opioid epidemic. In July, I'll be meeting with various local politicians from county commissioners office, a few judges, the county sheriff, my local state representatives, plus staff from the governor's office.

The meeting is slated to be a kind of round-table Q-and-A where they can ask what is wanted/needed by the community and we can ask what their respective offices are planning/are willing to do. This is going to be a two-day event and I've been guaranteed some one-on-one time *(knowing my luck, probably with the sheriff's office)* in addition to the normal group dynamic stuff. 

So, now that you know the background, what do you think I should be bringing to the table? Before anyone says ""supervised injection sites,"" please keep in mind this is a very rural, very Republican area. While pie-in-the-sky goals are great, it's been hard to get them to even consider simple harm reduction efforts, so let's keep shit in the realm of possibility. The fact that these die-hard conservatives are even making this much of an effort is goddamned amazing as is; no need to piss off all the old white guys by asking them for free blow and hookers. *(Besides - they want all the coke and whores for themselves...)*

If anyone has any peer-reviewed studies/publications they think I should mention, that'd be extremely helpful. Also, if anyone has any information on programs which qualify for federal or outside, third-party funding, please, *please* let me know. The cheaper or freer something is the more likely they'll be to support it.

Thanks everyone, and I'll be sure to update you all after the fact.

FUN!,"The point of telling this story here is as a cautionary tale, and hopefully to get some advice from others who deal with terrible constipation from using dope.

I‚Äôll start the story in the middle... I was using dope for a long time, got off of it by using kratom for a long time, ended up getting back on dope again.. Both of these things cause pretty serious constipation. So I wouldn‚Äôt poop at all for a good week, then a little handful of pebbles once every day or two, that are hard to pass and very unsatisfying.. Months and months and months of this, it sucked, but I didn‚Äôt realize how much shit was building and building up in my colon or intestine or wherever it builds up.. Until one morning I awoke with some pretty nasty stomach pains, so I sat on the toilet and tried to get something out, to no avail, as usual. But the pain would not subside, and it was BAD! I was burping a lot too, and it tasted bad like sulfur, so i KNEW something was extra rotten down there... I switched from fetal position on the floor, to on the toilet trying with all my being to pass ANYTHING!! And the pain was persistent the entire time.. a good 8-9 hours of NONSTOP gut pain. My anus was in a constant state of PUSH. I couldn‚Äôt get it to relax. My butthole was puckered and trying to push, beyond my control, for hours and hours! It was crazy! After a while I was literally screaming from the pain... but NOTHING WOULD COME OUT! During one of my lying on the floor periods, I felt like something might be ready to come out, but since nothing would happen any other times, I figured ‚Äòfuck it‚Äô just keep pushing and let it happen.. so a whole lotta liquid shit stew started erupting all over the place... my legs, the rug, the floor, the walls.... but that was okay.. at least something was coming out... so, this happened maybe 3 more times over the course of a few hours.. and all of those times I was in fetal position on the floor... but still nothing solid, just lots and lots of liquid shit everywhere! Finally, after a period sitting on the toilet, screaming, with the nonstop uncontrollable sphincter pushings going on, a GIGANTIC slightly squished softball sized (literally) DRY sickly looking tumor of nasty dead SHIT passed out and it was INSANE! I can honestly say, it was probably on par with a woman giving birth. About the literal size of a baby‚Äôs head... maybe even bigger..... it was fucking crazy! I weighed 7-8lbs lighter after the whole incident was through.. I felt like i just came back from war. And all i could do was lie there in my mess... Thankfully when my girlfriend came home to find me half naked completely covered in shit, passed out from exhaustion, lying on the bathroom floor, with SHIT EVERYWHERE, she only freaked out a little bit.. and was able to get me cleaned up, clean up the bathroom a little, put me in some clean dry clothes, and get me into the bed. It felt like fucking HEAVEN lying in that bed with that ordeal behind me! I still felt like death, but after literally sleeping through an entire day, and half of the next one, I felt much better. Since that huge fecal compaction was finally passed, and my bowels were clear for the time being, I was even shitting normal for the next few days!

BUT, of course, I kept on using dope like normal, and eventually I‚Äôve become pretty backed up again. I would do ANYTHING to never go through experience again (except stop using drugs of course..) I read that I could‚Äôve even died if it didn‚Äôt pass that day!  So, I‚Äôve been giving myself enemas every couple days, and that‚Äôs gotten some shit to pass a bit. It‚Äôs still mostly little marble sized balls that look bloody and light brown, and certainly not healthy. Definitely not as much as I think should be coming out though.. I‚Äôd love to try the prescription laxative specifically designed for opioid induced constipation called Movantik.. but it seems there‚Äôs no OTC off brand or anything similar out there.. SO, the purpose of me sharing this harrowing tale with you guys, is to serve as a pretty serious cautionary tale as to just how bad it can get, AND to see if anybody has the best of the best advice for getting some real serious bowel movements moving through my bowels!

Hopefully some of you have read this entire ramble of a story. Any help would be awesome. And yes, i know quitting would be the best option, but it just ain‚Äôt gonna happen right now. So, I‚Äôm trying my best. 

TL;DR - Got so constipated and full of shit that my body couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and it HAD to come out! I‚Äôm looking for the best advice for combating opioid induced constipation of the highest order.

First of all, this is my first post ever on Reddit (yay) although I've been on the site for years.

My question may have been asked before but I've searched for an hour and couldn't quite find an answer so I thought I'd give it a go myself.

While reading the text below, keep in mind I have virtually no tolerance to any opiate. 

So a month ago I got hold of a few strips of oxycodone 5 mg IR. I tried 5 mg first; felt nothing. A few days later I took 15 mg and still felt nothing. This afternoon I decided to take 30 mg at once (might've been irresponsible in hindsight, but I figured since 15 didn't do anything, doubling it wouldn't be that extreme). I still felt nothing so took another 20 mg, and when that didn't work either I decided redosing again would be useless. The only effect I felt after the 50 mg dose today was a very very slight nausea.

The same thing happened a year ago when I drank codeine/promethazine with a couple friends: everybody was nodding off and I felt completely sober. 

The above makes me wonder whether it's possible for people to be with an extreme tolerance to opiates/opioids. I'm aware of people whose bodies can't convert codeine to morphine, but does a similar problem exist with oxycodone?

I hope someone who has knowledge of this subject has the time and interest to talk about it with me.

Sorry if my message is a bit awkward and badly written, as I said this is my first post ever so I don't quite know how to write a good Reddit post hahah. Also English isn't my native language so Grammar Nazis please have mercy.

Im on MMT and once 4-5pm comes around im dead tired. (I dose at 5:30am every morning, maybe 6am at the latest.)  
The ol' lady goes to work at 5pm since i work mornings. I have a son who's not even 3 yet so his bed time is still around 7pm so im up with him until he goes to bed. On top of that, sometimes he likes to give me a hassle and just jump around and play in his crib/bed for an hour or two.

Last year I finally washed my hands of a 15 year alcoholism problem and quit drinking. Haven‚Äôt felt the desire to pick up a drink since. 

On Feb 7th of this year I decided I had had enough of drugs. I had a good run on painkillers for 16.5 years. Then, in a year and a half Heroin and Fentynal took everything from me. My apartment, my job, my girl, my relationships, my family, my car, everything. I was homeless, scrounging for money every day, maxed out all my credit cards and spent every last penny I had shooting up. 
So I went in to rehab. Lasted about a week and ran away and immediately relapsed. What followed was a roller coaster of being in and out of treatment for the next couple months. Since February I have been in 9 different treatments. Rehabs, detoxes, recovery houses, etc. and I would either AWOL, AMA, or my insurance would give me the boot. I never completed one. 
Well I finally just finished a five day detox and was able to finally get on methadone. I know that methadone is a very divisive subject, but honestly for me, it‚Äôs been a game changer. I have honestly had no cravings, no desire to use, and no desire to get high since starting on it last week. 
That coming on the heels of the fact that about two weeks ago I overdosed and died, this was the right time to kick the habit. Plus, I never want to go through getting hit with Narcan again. I got hit with two doses by some kids on the street I was using with, which then was followed by one of the worst sixty minute experiences of my life. I had been using heavily, and the instant withdrawal I went in to was absolutely brutal. I was cryshitsweatvomitting everywhere to the point that I thought about just collapsing and giving up and lying in my own filth until someone either called an ambulance or the cops. 
Fortunately I got to a hospital where they let me ride it out until it all passed. I went through probably about 5 days of withdrawal in about 35 minutes and it was terrible. Never again. 

So I‚Äôm currently on 55mg of methadone and we‚Äôve been kicking it up 5mg each day until we find my therapeutic dose. I honestly haven‚Äôt felt ‚Äúhigh‚Äù like the first few times I took methadone, but the cravings and urges have gone away. Which is good because I‚Äôm genuinely afraid of heroin/fent now after dying off it. 

I also may have just found a recovery house that will let me continue maintenance, has a very affordable rent that covers 3 meals a day, will help you find a job, and is close to all sorts of public transit so that I can get around. So fingers crossed that I get in, I should find out by tomorrow at the latest and hopefully can move in on Thursday. 

So it‚Äôs been a fun run, with it‚Äôs ups and downs. I‚Äôve gotten clean plenty of times, and relapsed plenty more. The longest clean time I had ever put together in the past was about a week. I‚Äôm writing this today with **18 days**, and I‚Äôm hoping to really keep this one going this time. For myself mainly, but for the few people I have left who haven‚Äôt given up on me and still give a shit. 
I‚Äôm sure there will be days that I‚Äôll miss it, but at 33 years old with absolutely nothing to show for it, I‚Äôm hoping to finally turn my life around and start living for something more than just the next high. 

Thanks for letting me share!

Tl;dr Started methadone after OD‚Äôing and dying and it‚Äôs been a lifesaver. Haven‚Äôt had urges or cravings, and after tons of relapses and previously only having at most a week of clean time, I currently have 18 days and more hope and confidence then I‚Äôve ever had. But the humble kind of hope and confidence, not the cocky kind that gets me back in trouble. 


**EDIT: Just found out today that I got in to that recovery house I had been hoping for. I move in tomorrow. So hopefully this is the start of a completely new chapter of my life, one that continues to be clean and sober. Who knows, a year from now maybe I can have my life back and have turned this whole thing around. Maybe one day I‚Äôll be the one sitting at the front of a meeting sharing my story to a room full of people who are right where I‚Äôm at now. And hopefully I can give hope to even just one person in that room that it does get better. That‚Äôs what I look forward to, the chance to give back to the community that took the time and compassion to give a shit about me when I didn‚Äôt give a shit about myself. **",1527631803.0

It started as a teenager, opioids became by DOC however i got clean relatively quickly (within 6 months) and was satisfied with a moderate methadone dose and some weed for many years afterwards.

At about the age of 24, roughly 5 years since using opioids recreationally (I had already been wiened of opioids and it worked fine) I developed nerve pain to a degree that I can't even explain. Within the first week I felt so bad i thought I was dying, but I didnt die, I  just kept feeling that bad week after week, day after day

About a year in I chose to go back to opioids with the rules of ""Never to use IV"" and ""Never to use to get high, only to relieve pain"". I was in so much physical pain i became suicidal.

I held out for about a year but of course i chose opioids over suicide for my mothers sake. about half the week i would be back to my old self, the other half i'd be lying in bed all day. My parents quickly surmised was i was doing and helped me until i got a methadone prescription for pain, however my doctor would not raise it over 35mgs and I had already been taking 80mg for pain.

Now I have a very atypical addiction. I require at least 100mgs of methadone to get pain relief, im not sure of an exact dose of other opioids, however 30mgs of dilaudid intranasally is plenty for an entire day of pain relief. I'm not physically addicted despite my high tolerance, I take 3-4 days off each week and i dont experience withdrawal, only my original symptoms. However this pain relief is SO important to my life. If someone tried to take away I'd rip their head off. It isn't fun to only live 3-4 comfortable days and then to be ridiculously sick for 3-4 days, but in my opinion its better to be that sick EVERY day when im only 28 years old.

TL:DR Does anyone have a very high tolerance but has kept themselves from physical addiction through forced days off?",1527624197.0

I've been on methadone for quite awhile now with no success, as I had a pretty bad fentanyl habit before this, so now I'm on 250mg methadone, and my last visit to the doctor I told him how i've been just searching for stronger alternatives now to get through the methadone and how i haven't been happy/content on methadone so far n it's not really helping me a whole lot, he finally said to me in our last meeting ''would you like to try and switch to Kadian then?'' I was relieved he mentioned this as i've been thinking about how much better that would probably be for me, I just wanted to see if anyone else has had any experience with Kadian despite how new it is in the MMT options. 

I'm just out here visiting my home city, when I get back to where I live i'll be starting on the Kadian.. for this week until the 7th it's gonna be methadone.

Just wanted to see how people like it, and how sick do you think I might get in the transition from methadone to Kadian? and what dose am I gonna have to be on? I'm looking forward to it.

8mw7bk,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mw7bk/a_methadone_review/,0,https://redd.it/8mw7bk,sloan_fitch,A Methadone Review,"The deed is done. I'd like to think that I did it for scientific reasons but the truth is that I was hoping it would get me high. Did it? Not sure. I felt something but it was definitely quite mild. I took 2mg of Suboxone early on the first day and consumed 20\-40ml of Methadone. On day two I drank the remainder which was probably like 20\-25ml. The first day I drank the meth around 6pm. On the second day I drank it at 8am. Since I was taking and tapering down subs for days prior, it's possible that the built\-up bupe in my bloodstream blocked some of the effects of Methadone but in my experience with dope, I'm usually able to get high later in a day when I take 2mg of bupe.

My appetite was not adversely affected and my athletic abilities seemed to have all remained. That said, the Methadone did make me feel sleepy. I was compelled to take naps after eating lunch on both days on Methadone. Didn't lay down for more than an hour or two but it was still a strong compulsion. Each night I also had no trouble getting a good night's sleep.

Finally, day three with no Methadone left it was time to consider when to start taking Suboxone. It worked out better than expected. I figured that I'd either go through the better part of the day getting sick and gradually sicker before I could safely take a sub. So while w aiting to feel sick enough to take a sub I felt mostly quite fine. No gastro symptoms but the yawns were coming on and ss some may say, ""once the yawns start, it's over."" In this case, although I had the yawns and a little wateryness in the eyes, I didn't encounter any other symptoms to any appreciable strength. Sure, coldness was a little more noticable but it's not really that cold inside or outside. Frankly I was digging for symptoms and none of them were particularly srong aside from the yawns.

No anxiety except for that which stems from the thought, ""when can I take a sub without getting sick?"" Also, a concern about work. I knew that I'd be good to take a sub by tomorrow morning before work without the risk of encountering PWD but what if I got called into work tonight and said yes without thinking? Sure enough, my supervisor did call me and asked if I wanted to come in and work for four hours in the evening. So I did a little reading and made some decisions based on my situation.

My situation:

As stated above, I took a total of 60ml of Methadone over the course of two days. I consumed a smaller amount on the second day than I did on the first day. After a normal night's sleep I counted the hours since my last dose of Methadone. From 8AM on Sunday to 12PM on Monday I had 26 hours. At 3pm I had 29 hours under my belt.

In retrospect, I counted all wrong. At the time my wishful thinking had me calculate 4PM as the 36 hour mark. Boy was I wrong as I think about it now and boy was I lucky. Well, maybe not lucky. The science of the matter is that it's important for a person who has been taking Methadone for multiple days or weeks to wait a minimum of 36\-48 hours to induce subs. In fact, I've read longer in many cases for good reason. For me, the dose was already somewhat low and the time spent taking the meth was short.

Normally I take Suboxone no sooner than 12 hours after my last use of dope or pills. I've taken it at the 9 hour mark once with great fear in my heart but was indeed in withdrawal so it worked out. I heard that if you take a small amount of Suboxone before using dope, then use dope that you could induce and take subs once more without PWD as long as you no longer feel high. Since I did take 2mg of Suboxone a few hours before the first dose of Methadone, maybe this played a role? If not, then I'd say the other factors were at play. The time spent \(2 days\), the dose and the timing of the follow\-up Suboxone. Well heck, probably all of those factors along with the initial 2mg dose of Suboxone prior to taking the Methadone contributed to my good outcome.

For good meansure I started with .25mg of Suboxone. Then another .5mg after concluding that I did not feel any worse after 40 minutes. Then 30 minutes later I took 1mg. In the end I did take a total of \~\~4mg\~\~ 3mg. Although I mostly have subs in pill form, I had a couple of strips and I opened one in order to have greater certaintly to the dosage being administered.

I remember my friend Tim told me about his Precipitated Withdrawal experience. Six hours after doing a lot of dope he didn't feel great so he thought it was time to take a sub. He did a whole strip. Then when he got fucking sick from that he did another and another. A lot of people think similarly to him \(maybe not to the same extremes\) and figure more of a good thing is better.

Point is, less is more with subs. I've read it here from other people and I've learned it myself. The only time less isn't more is when you're in regular withdrawal and are comparing the therapeutic effects of 1mg to 4mg. 1mg just doesn't seem to touch it. That, or like many others I'm just impatient to wait and see. A lot of people probably up their dose after not seeing desirable effects from the first dose.

Bottom line, by the time I took the last mg of Suboxone and had \~\~4mg\~\~ 3mg in me, I felt very well. After biking to work I felt like a million bucks. Would a smaller dose of Suboxone have been potentiated by the biking? I wonder how much lower of a dose I might've been able to get away with.

Last but not least importantly. Thank you to those who shared their wisdom in[ that previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mcxw9/as_far_as_derrick_is_concerned_cliff_might_as/) even if I didn't follow it, I appreciate all warnings that are intended to prevent precipitated withdrawal.

I look him directly in the eyes as I do w everyone do see if his eyes are pinned or dilated, and I can immediately tell bro is going thru it, so I tell him to wait and I‚Äôll help him out.

I get out my 40, get in line to get change for him, and after 15 seconds of being in line I glance out the door, and my car is gone.

My stomach curled up, like the feeling you get when you get kicked in the balls. It was the worst. I should‚Äôve gone back and taken my keys out of the car, but we all know when you‚Äôre in that mode where copping is the only thing on your mind and you have get dope tunnel vision .. you‚Äôre awareness attribute drops at least 10-15 points easy

Fast forward 1 month, and I get a call that THEY FOUND MY FUCKING CAR. I go get it out of the impound, and they installed aN iHome, left a charger, a coloring book, the card smelled phenomenal, and they left a bag of fire.

I couldn‚Äôt have been happier

This culminated in me having to puke after I got home.  My stomach and lower throat have felt ""hot"" all day after I did the dope so I went in the bathroom to throw up.  At first it was just some of the BK and water/soda I had, but then I began to see blood.  A little at first, but then more noticable amounts.

I took a shower and my stomach still felt ""hot"" so I took another Tums and now I'm drinking water and eating some bread.

This batch was MUCH stronger than the last, and I told him this numerous times. He normally listens to me because I have more experience than him, as well as I just read a shit ton of stuff on drugs in general. Anyway, we did some last night and it was pretty good shit. I did ~18 mg and he did ~25. 
   For a little background, my friend somehow needs more than the average dose of any drug to feel the effects. We hung out last night, all was good. He even bought a scale because I warned him this stuff is too dangerous to eyeball. He dropped me off at my house around 10 pm last night and I told him for probably the 20th time to be safe and ask me if he has any questions. Cue me nodding off and waking up every 30 minutes til around 3 am. He'd been texting me saying he's just super tired and isn't euphoric so he's gonna take more etc and I suggest maybe 10 mg more but do half of it and then wait a lil then do the other 5 mg if necessary. (Even if I said don't take anything he still would take some sadly).
   Well we were gonna hang out today and I get no texts or anything. I had a crazy dream he overdosed last night and his parents traced it back to me etc and I'm fucked for life. Cue a few minutes ago, I get a text from him saying not only did he get caught with the dope but he overdosed... His sister resuscitated him and he's been in the hospital all day. The thing that confuses us both is he doesn't recall if he overdosed last night or this morning. He said he remembers dropping me off at my house then waking up in an ambulance today. 
   I feel horrible. If I hadn't have given him his share, he wouldn't have overdosed and gotten fucked by his family. I've only been doing heroin for a little over a month now I think and this is already getting too fucked up for me.

8mv6kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8mv6kb/opium_experience_report/,9,https://redd.it/8mv6kb,trameyes,Opium experience report,"Well I got ahold of some opium from the onion farmland nearby (wink), it was in a form of caramel-colored crumbs/shards (not powder-like though) and it smelt very earthy/planty. I'm not physically addicted to opiates FYI and use them only occasionally. 

Smoking it off foil proved to be unsuccessful, it took a long time for it to melt and it wouldn't really produce any vapor strangely enough, or maybe I'm just a noob since I've never smoked anything off foil before. So I just decided to eat it. 

The taste was overwhelmingly bitter, so I gulped it down with some water. About an hour in produced the familiar body warmth sensation that you all folks love over here, and the high lasted around 6 hours. To be honest it was pretty underwhelming because it wasn't really any stronger than codeine, although my prior kratom use might've had to do with that, and I was eating quite small amounts since I didn't want to accidentally overdose. 

The coolest part was when I'd decided to eat a bit more than I did before, I laid down on my bed listening to some ambient/drone music and got nodding quite hard. I started having these weird visions, kinda like dreaming but actually being awake - for example I'd hallucinate that I opened my phone and checked my messages but then realised that my eyes were actually closed and I wasn't moving. Very weird. Also started remembering some details from my past which I haven't thought about in a while. 

All in all kind of underwhelming since I thought of opium as this mysterious antique drug, but the experience was worth it. At least now I can brag to people that I did it lol. The biggest downside is that I had a very hard time trying to take a piss next day after using. ",1527557731.0

I‚Äôm a chronic pain sufferer, having arthritis in my back and neck and I‚Äôm not even old enough to legally drink. Pain is something that takes a toll on my day, my whole day revolves around my pain. Well, I decided to do six Ketamine infusions and it was the best thing I could have done. Having had an opiate addiction, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, all of these diseases were eliminated if not then minimized a significant amount. It‚Äôs weird not having back pain anymore, like I don‚Äôt know what to do because I‚Äôm used to it controlling my day all of the time. I‚Äôm still in the habit of popping my back even though I don‚Äôt have to. The back pain is still there a little bit but almost unnoticeable. I forget about it until someone ask me how it is and I realize there‚Äôs a little bit of discomfort. The main benefits for me was my cravings for dope absolutely disappeared, throughout the six infusions the dr asked me how my cravings were twice and I had 100% forgotten about the word cravings. It was insane. My anxiety and depression have practically been eliminated entirely. Please read up about the benefits of Ketamine and give it a try. It changed my life and it can change yours too.

I lost my job, my car, my independence due to heroin. Had to move back in with my parents. Well they moved 60 miles north of where we were living at the time and I had no choice but to go with them. My job was super well paying for my age. Now I'm stuck in a shitty retail knock off of what I'm doing. I'm trying to go back to school but you can't file for FAFSA if you didn't file your taxes, which I didn't for 2016 because I owed the IRS money somehow. Now I'm trying to get that all figured out, but can't because I'm always working my shitty dead end job.

I'm getting depressed. Made a post on whisper trying to cold cop, got ripped off. The kratom is starting to fail and I'm looking for any reason to get high.

So, onto the question. I am curious if anyone reacts this way or has seen someone react this way to heroin use. I've been using on and off (intravenously) for about 5 years. Probably about a year into my use heroin started to affect me differently. I wouldn't do the typical sit back and nod.

What happens is I'll start to go into somewhat of a psychosis (the closest word I can think of to describe it) and I'll begin to do many different ""odd"" things. I'll start to sweat profusely (like to the point where my body is dripping wet), I'll sometimes start to get naked, I'll scratch my body all over (scratching hard enough to break skin, it's very unsightly), pull out chunks of my hair, scream/yell/cry very loudly.... And the weirdest thing is I never know I'm doing these things WHILE I'm doing them. I'm completely unaware until I come down and usually have people pissed at me/freaked out.

Of course every one of my connects are sleeping, and I'm sick as a dog. So I decide to do something very dumb and try to cold cop in the middle of the night.

I've cold copped successfully a couple times, but it's always been during normal hours.  I hit the normal spot in the projects, but no one is out.  As I'm driving away, I see a guy walking down the main road.  I stop at a red light and all he's looking at me, so I ask him if he has P.  He says he does and I let him in my car.

As soon as he gets in, I know he's lying because he starts saying ""now where did I put it..."".  I ignore his instructions to drive down side streets and head to a gas station on the border of the hood and park at a pump.

He finds a big bag and I know it's not dope as soon as I see it.  No one is carrying a half ounce of solid rock dope in a back pack at 4am.  He at least should have had it in glassine bags, then he probably would have got me.

He breaks off a couple chunks and gives them to me, I try to dissolve a tiny piece and it doesn't do anything, the rock just sits there.  He says I need to grind it up.  I tell him to get out of my car and he demands a ride back to where I got him.  I'm not driving back into the hood. Especially when he is trying to rob me.  He won't get out and is demanding $20.  He starts reaching like he has a gun, so I pop him in his jaw as hard as I can and hop out the car.  It's obvious he's all talk at this point because he didn't do anything.  I tell him I'm gonna drag him out the car if he doesn't get out and I walk to his side, he finally gets out but he's standing by the door demanding money.  I get back in and so does he, I hit him again and dodge his punch back by getting out.  He finally closes the door and I lock it.  He takes one final swing at me through the window as I drive off.

I said if he's lucky I'd paper the shit out of the whole city, but that I wasn't feeling nice and would involve the cops.  (which you all know I'd never do in a million years but he believed me so that's all that matters) I also said and on top of it that that wouldn't be all I'd continue to make it my mission to make his life a living hell and that he would always have to watch his back. 

Remember that pimp dude I told you guys about? So he actually turned out to be cool and backed WAY the fuck off once I ignored him for like a month. I told him about this and h'es a super big guy with a ton of friends and he said if I couldn't take care of it he would. His marijuana cafe is also right across from my house and his cameras look right onto my building door so he has footage of fuckboy stealing my phone.

I'm telling you these pakistani dealers are so non-violent and passive. I was the one with the knife and the pepper spray seriously prepared to go NUTS even thought I've never gotten into a fight with a man. He gave me back the phone reluctantly called me as slut asked me if I wanted to sell my pussy that I could work for him tried to degrade me basically. I laughed so hard. Then he said ""see you when you get out of rehab"" 


I know some of you might disagree with myt hreat to go to the popo..but honestly please know I would NEVER actually do it. And I'd never make a threat like that if he hadn't been a thieving ass piece of shit and stolen from me in my HOME. IF I was back home I probably wouldn't have said that and would have just gotten some trusty guy friends and gone after him but here in Spain that's just not how things go. Sure it's ann illegal market it's black but like...all these guys are doing the RAMADAN LOL and they go to the mosque every night...they're not gangsters they're just trying to make a living in a country with high unemployment and few opportunities..


Moral of the story..don't let yourself get bent over and fucked because word will spread and it WILL happen again. Don't be too afraid puff out your feathers have some courage try to make things right but also use your better judgement...

REhab is the day after tomorrow so if I don't talk to you guys again I just wanna say I love every last one of you and I'll talk to you in a couple weeks. MUAH <3

I been checking this sub for ages. 
You guys are the coolest. I‚Äôm serious -most posts and comment threads are heartfelt and/or funny, sad too. 
Question: have the internet rules changed? Seems like cold-copping via the internet just got like hard to impossible. Hope that doesn‚Äôt break the sub rules. But I‚Äôm just wondering. 

Anyway, I gotta come clean - I‚Äôve been using for many years. I moved cities about 15 years ago to get away from problems. My2best friends fell pray, and had to get clean, so I took up my brother‚Äôs offer to live with him until I got it together. But problems have a way of following you everywhere, don‚Äôt they? Hahahaha. 
So now, I‚Äôve been chipping for the past year. Only snorting, taking 1-2 days off every week. I cop a half g (my guy is essentially a middle, and deals half and full Gs, no buns or stamp bags - yes I know that places me on the EC) on Monday and a full G on Thursday. Every damn week. I get upcharged cuz middle, so it‚Äôs $375 every week. Steady, reliable. Sometimes it‚Äôs got that almost gray-blue look to it, sometimes it‚Äôs re-rocked,  but it‚Äôs generally pretty good. 
Oh, and - my d-boy is a friend of my boss. They both have serious habits. You believe that shit? Lol. 2 middle aged family guys, pulling in millions, driving their Mercedes back to their houses on some Circle, with a pool, brought to their knees by dope. They actually prefer fent-cut shit, but I try and tell them that pure shit is better. Sometimes I go into my boss‚Äô office and he jams a letter opener into his big-ass 3G bag and sticks it under my nose. Then he chews me out because I have to make deadlines or draft a document hahahaha. It‚Äôs freakin crazy, y‚Äôall. White collar junky. 
I‚Äôm the guy at work in the bathroom stall taking hits off a pen cap, ‚Äúwow your eyes are so blue today! Your pupils are so small!‚Äù My eyes are green, lady. And shut up about it. 

I went up to the family vacation spot a few weeks ago. I think I got food poisoning - it lasted for a day, then I was fine. But I mighta been dope sick. 
That‚Äôs when I realized, I‚Äôm really playing with Fire (no pun intended), and I need to make a change. If I‚Äôm afraid of getting sick, even if it‚Äôs just like mental stuff, then I‚Äôm too deep in it. Chipping for a year will get you. It will always get you. That‚Äôs just what happens - dope always wins. Until you tell it to fuck right off (and mean it).
So today I‚Äôm on the couch, chillin on a sub. Not sure how I‚Äôm going to move forward.

I am a chronic pain patient and have been on 20mg IR oxycodone tablets 4x a day for a little over a year. Unfortunately my condition is a degenerative bone disease so the bones in some of my joints are slowly dying.  It's...very painful to say the least.

I (mostly) take my medication as prescribed.  Once in a while if I'm bored on a weekend I'll rail one or two.

Last visit to my pain doc, I asked if there's any other medication I should be considering that would be more effective.  He went on to explain that for someone like me, who has to be on opiates for the foreseeable future to live my day to day life, he would normally suggest moving to Opana ER (oxymorphone?).  He said ""So maybe...I'd give you like 20mg Opana ER 2x a day and then maybe...like 5 mg of oxycodone 2x a day for breakthrough pain.""

He said he would write the new scripts that visit but I was unsure which treatment plan would best treat my pain.  I know pain is very subjective so it will be hard for someone to give a straight answer to me but...I'd just like some of your experienced input on if one of these plans is glaringly obviously better than the other.

I just wanted to type up a quick post suggesting tianeptine to those who enjoy opiates - I took 350mg about an hour and a half ago and am definitely feeling pretty good. This is a pretty high dose but I was looking to experience it on a recreational level and have some tolerance to opiates with recent use. If you decide to try it, work your way up don‚Äôt use my dose as a benchmark, everyone‚Äôs biochemistry and tolerance are different. That being said this drug doesn‚Äôt cause much respiratory depression and has a great safety profile. I‚Äôve heard withdrawals can be pretty rough but don‚Äôt plan on using it very often, despite using other opiates with more regularity. It definitely has opiate activity at this dose - my mood is quite elevated, and my pupils a bit constricted. If I stay still I‚Äôll ‚Äúnod‚Äù in a way, not to the extent of a large dose of other opiates but I‚Äôll kindve close my eyes for a bit and not want to open them. I‚Äôll also add that I am starting to get than opiate itch, which I personally enjoy. Even though my dose is mostly just starting to kick in, I‚Äôve read that the duration is extremely short, 2-4 hours with the sodium salt. Can‚Äôt comment on the sulphate version of this compound currently but I did get some for future experimentation.

I‚Äôve used this drug a long time ago with no tolerance - I forget what amount, but it was definitely a recreational dose and I had no tolerance at the time. The nod on the occasion was much stronger along with extreme pupil construction. So for people new to opiates, again, use good judgement ingesting, it can be stronger than what I‚Äôm making it out to be currently.

This drug has a lot going for it in that it is relatively cheap, legal, and has nootropic qualities. Worth researching if that kindve thing is of interest to the reader. It‚Äôs a unique opiate in that it is a tricyclic antidepressant, not a traditional opiate but demonstrates mu and delta agonist qualities with no kappa affinity. In layman‚Äôs terms, it effects the brain in the way that an opiate with desirable qualities would at larger doses.

I wanted this to be a quick informative dip your toes in the info type post, ill end it here and go back to enjoying my high.

If anyone has any experience or info regarding tianeptine, feel free to add it. For those with questions, I‚Äôll try my best to answer them with the preface I‚Äôm no expert on it or pharmacology.

Thanks for reading and consider trying it if you enjoy opiates.

Thanks for reading all!

Relapsed, almost killed myself about 3 times driving on heroin, benzos, and alcohol (with a pending DUI mind you). Got kicked out of the house, roommate steals my macbook and my camera. And now my girl found out I took her bars and told me shes probably leaving me (I'm thinking she wont but I still feel wretched because I love the piss out of her) and she doesn't even know I went on a week heroin bender. Also left an implied suicide note for my baby sister to find and traumatize the fuck out of her.

Luckily I didn't slam anything and I got about two weeks of squatting essentially at my grandparents to figure some shit out but man am I spinning rn. I think Layne Staley once said 'used to be curious, now this shit is sustenance'. It's like something I can never run away from, and since I'm still battling wicked depression, trauma, anhendonia from being of opiates I've been substituting other downers even before the relapse. I guess it's just time to buckle down and get some mental health and addiction related support and try and preserve. I also lost my card and wont have money till Thursday and ate my 2 bars I had saved for detox right now on day one because of the s/o. 


Did I mention I lost my job for calling in to support my lady while she had a medical procedure and then showed up high the next day, like nodding standing up high.


Man I really screwed the pooch here. But all is not lost. I just really dont want to lose the girl, shes a real gem and I love her more than life itself at times(yes I know that I at times engage in borderline codependency with her). But my best friend from birth who doesn't even drink seems to have secured a really cheap room and wants me on my feet so I am grateful for that and having a room to kick dope in.

 Any kind words or advice would really brighten my day. No negativity please, I have enough guilt as is and I know everyone of you regulars here have done this or worse a million times over. Precisely why I post here. I'm gonna hit a meeting tomorrow, get a sponsor, and get in it to win it or I'm shooting dope on the street again or in box.

TL/DR
Relapsed, almost died, got kicked out, a roommate stole computer, stole from gf and she may leave me, lost my job, and left my baby sis a suicide note now I'm all fucked up but not going back to junk

much love, 
if theres anyone on here who remembers me, esp. tinychat please chime in

I live in the UK and am on diamorphine (pure heroin) maintenance.

I get 7 packs of 5 100mg injectable ampules once a week from the chemist. It costs me ¬£28 a week.

The heroin is pure and I just mix it with sterile water and inject it intravenously.

I feel completely normal and live a completely normal and functional life with a well-paying job and a family. I have been for 15 years since being able to access legal pure heroin.

All the problems I experienced back in the day that are blamed on ‚Äúheroin‚Äù are really the result of the PROHIBITION of heroin.

I just got a text from my guy saying that this stuff is definately not smokable and all his smokers were complaining but you can definately bang it.

So my questions are:
1 has anyone ever heard of heroin that does not smoke?

And

2 if it works for injection this must mean it is water soluble and being water soluble I should be able to snort the heroin.... correct?

Please all let me know your thoughts and comments. I'm kind of upset knowing ahead of time that I cannot smoke the damn shit although I will still probably try. Only receiving a point anyways. Thanks!!!",1527457967.0

I keep telling myself I want to quit but I just can't do it. I've come to a realization that I really don't want to quit I just know that I need to. I've quit before in the past and I was clean for a long time and I remember actually wanting to be clean. I remember how hard it was I remember the whole thing like it was yesterday, so why can't I do it now? I absolutely have to. Nobody knows of my use. I can barely make it 24 hours before I cave in. I've been suicidal the past couple weeks especially these past couple days. I don't think I have the guts to do it but it seems like the easy way out. I can't reach out for help I will really let down my family and probably lose my job which is a great career. I know I just need to push through it and suffer for a week. But a week feels like an eternity when you're not using. In the past 5 months I've gone maybe a few days without using. I'm thinking of seeing my old psychiatrist and confessing and maybe hopefully getting some comfort meds and psychological help. What should I do ? You guys are nothing but supportive. I love this community. I'm very proud of you guys when you post how long you've been clean for. I want to be just like that. The cravings absolutely kill me. I think I'm more addicted to the feeling of getting well than the actual high. I don't even get high anymore. My bank account is non existent. I can't go on like this anymore.  What are my options? Other than cutting myself off from this world. Love you guys. Take care of yourselves please. This is the worst life we could possibly live.

Quick story about the great night I had last night (If anyone even cares),"So I haven‚Äôt really seen any of my parents‚Äô friends whom I‚Äôd always go see when I was younger, (I‚Äôm 21 btw). So, yesterday I went with my dad and sister to my dad‚Äôs friend, my ‚ÄúUncle‚Äù Ricky‚Äôs house, (if you‚Äôre Italian you‚Äôd understand that, considering he‚Äôs not really my uncle). He actually just called me but that‚Äôs irrelevant. 

So i went over to his house yesterday ‚Äúsober‚Äù just off about 2.25 mg of Alprazolam and some bud. 
*Quick backstory*
The other night I stole my dad‚Äôs car to attempt to score which was a bust but regardless my parents found out. So when my dad told me about the party I said I‚Äôd probably go, and my dad texted me the day after I stole the car and said, ‚ÄúRicky really wants you to come to the party.‚Äù So I said, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll go, but on my soul if it turns into a mini Intervention I‚Äôm going to be pissed.‚Äù So he said it wouldn‚Äôt, whatever. So we get there, I‚Äôm high just from the bars and loud and I‚Äôm saying hi to people. 

I‚Äôm so not used to being around Italians, even though I am predominantly Italian. Sicilian, whatever. 

I went up to this one older gentleman whom my dad knew and I guess I had met a lot back when I was 7 or so. Anyway, I went to shake his hand and nope, kiss on the cheek üòò. So cute I didn‚Äôt mind at all. 

Anyways, I sit down at the adult‚Äôs table, essentially, and I meet this man named Tom. Okay y‚Äôall from the second I sat down I was just... mesmerized by him. Very cute, older, extremely sarcastic and goofy and... ugh, I can go on for forever. Was in the Army for 20 years, plays PC games like I do... let me stop. So me and him were somewhat briefly discussing my H, amongst other things, use, and he was telling me about how he‚Äôs been sober from 20 years and that he used to fuck with Meth and Vodka. Well... there‚Äôs the Grey Goose bottle in front of us and I was pouring a shot for myself. 

I was like, ‚ÄúOh my God I‚Äôm so sorry, is this a trigger?‚Äù He‚Äôs like, ‚Äú20 years üòä‚Äù so I said, ‚ÄúAnd do they ever go away?‚Äù ‚ÄúNope‚Äù, so I said ‚ÄúExactly, lol‚Äù. 

Long story short, after him and I talked her had me talk to his wife and y‚Äôall.... I cried, it was but wasn‚Äôt like anything anyone else has said to me. Of course I was drunk by that point but regardless she did say some relevant things.

And the funniest of all? 
It did turn into a lil mini intervention but I didn‚Äôt even care. 

TL;DR, had a great night, got drunk, and realized some shit regarding my use.",1527455387.0

Fuck. He‚Äôs our only connect. So I made a post on CL and Whisper trying to figure something out, and while I was waiting on a response we decided to try and cold cop. We don‚Äôt live in a major city so this is way easier said than done. 

We‚Äôre walking around the ‚Äúbad‚Äù part of town (the worst part of where I live is no where near dangerous by any definition of the word...or so I thought), talking to random people asking the usual questions when some big black dude runs up on us with a glock and takes my fucking wallet. Now we‚Äôre sick AND we‚Äôre broke. 

We cut our loses and start heading home. The only responses to my posts so far were the usual ‚Äúgive me head and I‚Äôll give you a G‚Äù type shit and we‚Äôre having none of that. Then a dude asks ‚Äúwhat are you looking for‚Äù (all I said in the CL post was that I was in pain and they don‚Äôt have my meds at the pharmacy). After I explain what we need and that we just got robbed this guy said if I can make it to him he can help us out. 

This dude gave us a .30 for free just because we were struggling. All he asked for in return is that we try to hook him up with any single chicks we know. Matt, idk if you use this Sub at all, but if you‚Äôre out there, thank you man. You‚Äôre a fucking saint. ",1527454431.0

Whats up ya'll? Been lurking here for a long time, I've recently come out of the closet with my habit in hopes I can maybe help a few people on this road we all love and hate so much. I'm 27, been a daily pot smoker for 11 years, was a daily drinker for 3 years and an opiate freak for the last 5 (they helped me kick the booze) :P..was prescribed Vicodin for 2 weeks followed by Tramadol for a skateboarding injury, my doc kept feeding me Tram for 2 years afterwards, think he felt bad because my ankle was not re-set before it was casted, healed a bit weird and still hurts to this day. When he cut me off, the withdrawals sent me into a hellish spiral of major depression and hardcore withdrawal as my daily dose was up to 300 mg per day, he refused to put me back on the hydro. 

 As a result i started looking for other shit and was quickly introduced to the beauty of harder opi's, namely blues and dilly shields, they kicked the ickies of coming off of Tram completely and honestly, gave me a feeling of peace and normalcy that ive never had before. I suddenly started making tons of friends, got more than enough attention from chicks (who sometimes just wanted me for my drugs or to ""fix"" me, i got off on letting them try). And honestly my work and social life just improved overall, I loved the lifestyle and all that it came with..better yet, i could afford it. I won $5,000 on the lottery at the peak of my use also which did me absolutely no good, i bought as many blues, 15's and dilly's as i could afford, blew the 5 g's in 3 weeks and had the best summer of my life..was up to 5 blues n 2-3 dilly's a day at my peak.

And then it came to a screeching halt. I lost my main plug, my online plug pulled an exit scam (he didnt rip me off personally, ironically he sent me my shit and disappeared 2 days later with a bunch of other peoples money), and i was forced to start a new job with less hours all at the same time. Since then, i've made it by on consistent monthly scripts (not my own) of 60 K-56's, 90 5 and 30 7.5 MG hydro, like 10 mscontin 30's cuz the dude only gets 30 and refuses to sell more..but these are my regular pickups monthly these days..and very occasionally, random treat bags such as this, the even more occasional point or two of boy..dboy sometimes calls trying to off some OP 40's that ill usually always grab asap, im partial to pills and will always look for em before i break down and grab a couple bindy's during rough times. My connections to better shit these days absolutely suck, which is probably a good thing for me..however no part of me wants to fully quit or go for treatment, yet. My use is nowhere near what it once was, but im still able to blow through 15 of the K-56's in a day, script of 60 typically lasts me a week tops, i pop hydro daily just to keep me straight and am always on the lookout for better shit, it sucks but i love it.

I dont know why im tellin ya'll all this this, guess there just arent many people i relate to IRL and i enjoy talking about drugs. Seem like a cool bunch of likeminded people here, im always down to talk if someones fucked up and needs an ear to bark at, always down to give advice or help out in any way that I can. I got alot to say and plenty'a good stories to share, hope ya'll have a good n safe holiday weekend. Sorry if this pic link doesnt work right, these are 3 blues and a few 15's i just got an extremely rare and lucky call on..funny i was just telling someone here how much i missed the U23's..the opiate gods heard my plea, sadly it's already almost gone :( hence the long winded, chatty post.",1527453794.0

2.every time I stick the needle in my arm and pull up the plunger to see if I get blood every single time its fills with blood so I push down and then I have a bump where I had the needle (meaning I missed)how can i tell for sure I'm I'm the vein?

3. How can you tell u deff missed a shot besides not getting high? By the bump it leaves under your skin?

4.do you always need to draw back the plunger to have blood go in ur needle or can you leave some space for blood to go in on its own?

I may or may not be  traveling out of the country and I was wondering how easy/hard is it to travel with a personal amount of H.  Have you, or perhaps a friend, had any experience traveling with H through the security checkpoints at your local airport? 

Would emptying out a few pills and refiling them suffice?

Until the fent order hits a local delivery node, I'm stranded on a backwards planet with eight milligrams of an orange-flavoured local 'delicacy' known to Earth's denizens as... sabbaxan?

I do not post much, but have been a dedicated lurker for almost a year now, basically since I started. 
I become incapacitated when I withdraw. 
Crippling depression, the worst RLS ever, crazy insomnia, emotions just up/down/left/right all over the place, and killer cravings. 
I started on Kratom about 2 years ago, mthen moved to a legal opiate high that shall not be named, and then jumped to Heroin when I found a reliable dealer.
I have only been using Heroin for about 8 to 10 months. 

My current habit is 5-8 tiny bags a day up the nose. This has grown from a recent 1 week bender where I've been doing 5-8 bags per day. 
I held a steady habit at 2-4 bags per day, but that restraint has fallen by the wayside. 
Never IV'd. 
Should I taper my dose down to one bag spread across the day? Or am I shallow enough to just jump CT? 
My question is how long should I take off work to get back close to my normal self? 
I am working and going to school trying to finish up my degree. I live alone. I must keep my job to be able to exist (rent, food, bills, GF). 
 I plan to go to my grandmother's house and just ride it out with as many comfort medications as I can get my hands on. Black seed oil, Xanax, lopermide, Magnesium Sulfate, Fish oil, Krill Oil, B Complex vitamin, Red Bali Kratom (GAIA), Kratom Extract (MOBotanicals), Phenibut, Tiantipine sulfate, Noopept, Creatine, one 7.5 Hydro, and as much exercise as I can muster (Running, Lifting, & Cycling)
Is this doable? 
It's crippling knowing my day and night depend upon a D boy.

I saw my psychiatrist last week but I had slightly downplayed my use to mum (who was there with me) and didnt ask for any withdrawal meds. I wanted to do it alone; yet 48 hours later the withdrawals were notably worse this week, my usual 20mg of lope wasnt providing relief and I was cold to the bone, sweating profusely, dissociated and freaking out. I ended up copping that day. I then contacted my psych with a suggestion of doing an at-home short term detox involving suboxone, diazepam and lyrica (that I will be sourcing myself). My psychiatrist has been following me for years with my mental health woes, is also awarr of passed MDMA, alcohol and marijuana abuse yet seems to be very trusting of me. He not only called me back within an hour, he also directly called up a GP specializing in substance disorders and referred me to see him first thing tomorrow. He is totally comfortable with the meds and suggestion I suggested which is amazing. He's truly an *awesome* psych.

I have a bit of a question tied to this post as well. Given a small amount (say a weeks worth of suboxone and diazepam) detox meds; what would my short detox/taper look like? Like specifically regarding doses per day? At this point in my use I can stay well on and cop a tiny buzz from like 0.2-0.3. But typically use at least half a G or more to have a dope day. I have used moderatrly in the last 3 days and will be today until tomorrow.Any advice is *truly* appreciated. And thank you to everyone here who has been so kind in providing reassurance and support!

The only time I can finally piss is around 8 hours after last use. It's to a point where I just can't enjoy the buzz because I know I'm going to sit there in pain for hours trying to pee.

I use fairy small amounts and take regular breaks so my tolerance is not that high. Is this something that people have noticed gets better as their tolerance goes up or its always a problem.

So after dinner I came by to speak. First a little catch\-up because he had a business idea weeks earlier that I wanted to hear about. Basically the idea involved drones to deliver goods, which is actually what Amazon has been working towards. I speculated that it would be risky for a fledgling company since the laws and regulatiosn for such venture are incomplete. Still, kicked ideas around and discussed what's presently going on and the possibilities as well as the current developments with regard to self\-driving cars.

&nbsp;

Anywho, I gave him some weed that I wanted him to try last week and he gave me some weed he had and also showed me his recently obtained batch of allegedly uncut dope. During our interaction he also asked me about Cliff as he went on to describe Cliff's recent behavior and communications to be very shady. Briefly I gave him a run\-down of my interactions with Cliff over the past week or two. Things like, ""I gave him the option to buy subs right after pay day, he said he didn't want or need any. Then he said he did but kept postponing only to have him ask if I could spare half a sub a week later."" I went on to confirm that Cliff was well in between pay checks while approaching script day.

&nbsp;

Regarding script day; I told Derrick if he ever get's told by Cliff that a certain day is script day that he could feel free to contact me to validate such a detail. Derrick went on to show me some text messages so that we'd be on the same page. Cliff fucked Derrick by accepting a bundle of dope on loan from him. Derrick paid full price for that and ended up having to scrap some silver in order to get the money to pay his dboy back. It was very important to him that he paid the dboy because he depends on him to come through when he makes an order so he knew he had to do right by his plug. 

Cliff's lies to Derrick and the promise to pay Derrick back depended upon Cliff getting his script on Wednesday. The text messages indicated he ran into a snag, but still showed optimism. Specifically, he claimed his local supermarket did not have the oxy script in stock so a text stated, ""They have it at the supermarket on the far end of town. I'm getting a cab now."" Followed by more postponements and stories. In fact, in order to testify that his lies were fact Cliff said in one of the messages ""my mom is in agonizing pain.. I have the receipt I can show you."" Now, I don't really understand what the receipt proves if he didn't even pick up the script; the receipt is what you get after paying for the script and getting it filled. I suppose he was claiming that the pharmacy gave him a receipt to indicate that they are in the process of filling the script. Not really sure but it doesn't matter because he's full of shit.

&nbsp;

Derrick didn't even bother asking to see the receipt, why bother wasting time reading and listening to a string of BS. In fact, Derrick is done with Cliff. Really \(very likely\) done serving, assisting, middling and/or dealing with Cliff \-\- no more. All the more reason not to ever go through Cliff if I ever wanted to buy myself dope again. I could just imagine the increased delays now that his only decent middle is no longer assisting him. That said, I'm really trying not to buy dope again from anyone. If I bought dope, I'd get high for a day... then have to take subs again, possibly more than the 2mg I've been taking. As I stand right now, I may not even need to buy more subs before the completion of my taper schedule. If I get myself down to 1mg in the next four days, I would still have a 16 day supply of subs at 1mg. If I bought dope on pay day, I'd probably have to buy more subs for good measure. So I'm highly motivated not to buy a bunch of dope. I've considered buying a bun and and a half but that money would be better spent on bike parts and clothes. Bar money too so that I can drink scotch while being attracting any lucky women who cross my path. I've been meaning to get myself back on the market. 

&nbsp;

Back to Derrick. He seems quite sincere about being done with Cliff. This last bundle of dope not being paid back in a timely manner was the last straw for him. He also went on to explain that he doesn't need Cliff's business, that he is already in a program and gets methadone daily. He middles because he can for his own pleasure and maybe a little as a favor for friends. This is the longest I remember Cliff being without drugs since Thanksgiving and possibly Christmas. Derrick didn't receive any more messages from Cliff after telling him that he was done serving him and dealing with his bullshit.

&nbsp;

I'm curious to see what Cliff does when he does get paid and has money for dope again. It's not impossible to find someone but I'm so glad that I won't be invovled with such an order under any circumstance. I'd imagine all manner of things would go wrong. If Cliff ran into a shortfall and wanted to have an extra day's of dope, if scamming me made it happen I know he would do it. For example, ""my friend delivered a half a bun, he's bringing the rest later tonight."" Then I'd be waiting as the time approached and Cliff would says ""he's waiting for his wife to go bed before he can sneak out and bring us the rest."" Then as it got later things would get bleak, maybe he'd pretend to make a phone call to his friend for a status update. When faced with such situations in the past I would offer to bike over to his ""friend's"" house to pick up the dope that the guy allegedly already has. On night one it wouldn't happen as we waited for the fictitious friend's wife to go to bed. Come three AM this ""wife"" would either still be up or it would be too late for the ""friend"" to drive over.

Come night two, I'd start early in offering to bike to the friend's house and Cliff would present optimism to that idea. ""Definitely tonight, less likely it'll be delivered"" or some crypic bullshit like that. Eventually I'd arrive at the conclusion that I'm not getting my half bun and a week later would receive pills to cover my loss. 

&nbsp;

Oh snap, I sidetracked and spoke about myself once again. Back to Derrick, again. So he layed out a bundle of dope to help Cliff get well on ""script day."" In reality, it was not script day. He went to the doctor that day but he can't get his script filled until Saturday. This is obviosuly not what he told Derrick. Hence the bullshit about having to get it filled at a pharmacy across town, bs reasons for delays prior to Derrick's messages where he basically states that he is done with Cliff's bullshit. 

Oh shit, brainstorm. It's a good thing that Cliff doesn't know I've directly bought Derrick. Even if he does have a hunch, he is never getting from Derrick again unless Derrick changes his mind. I could imagine Cliff asking me to place an order with Derrick for him. So I'd be middling to see a middle for Cliff. Fuck that. Never going to happen. 

&nbsp;

Bottom line, Cliff screwed his chief middle and is going to regret it. Scratch that. Will he regret that? I remember the time Cliff and Ben gave a fake hundred dollar bill to the dboy who identified it as such right away. The dboy still gave them a price break but obviously couldn't do anything with the fake bill and didn't accept it. One week later, the dboy delivered a batch of dope to Cliff and I. My part of the order was only $40, his share was over $200.

Right after the dboy left, we discovered the batch was 90&#37; fake. I firmly believe that was a result of the prior week's actions but Cliff denied and wouldn't accept that possibility. Thus he did not come to regret his choice of trying to pass a fake note off to his dboy. Just as he wont regret screwing Derrick even though his actions will prevent him from being able to procure through Derrick in the future. He won't have regret because as he lies to Derrick, me \(when he tells me the ""story""\) and himself the root cause of regret is obfuscated in a smokescreen of lies.

&nbsp;

Yes, eventually when Cliff is feeling better and more talkative he will contact me and say ""I have a story to tell you about Derrick."" He'll likely paint Derrick as the scumbag liar in the story though I've already saw their last message log so I'll look forward to comparing fact to fiction.

&nbsp;

P.S.\-

I didn't even mention the part where Derrick offered me 60mg of methadone from his take home bottle. Do I accept it? I've been on ever decreasing doses of bupe/subs for over a week. I'm curious what 15 or 30mg of methadone feels like but then I must also ask, ""what could go wrong?"" Well, regardless, Derrick is certainly not going to offer that 'done to Cliff. Had Cliff paid his debt or simply had not lied to Derrick in the first place to get a bun on loan, Derrick would've likely shared his take\-home dose to get help Cliff get well until the real script day.

All my money went to either food or H. I lost everything because of it. But now I have a wonderful relationship with an amazing woman I love dearly. I have a car. A home. A great job that I don't hate and can actually get up in the morning to go to without dreading every second of it.  And I've only been spending what I can afford to spend on opiates for the last 12 months now. 

If I'm ever in a pinch where I can't afford any, I stick with kratom. :) Alternating back and forth between recreational opiate use and kratom maintenance has been the best thing I could've done for myself. I was absolutely miserable when I was sober. I used H daily for 2/3 years. Up to 2gs a day at my worst. I quit cold turkey and was clean for 4 years and though the physical symptoms stopped, the happiness never came back. I never really felt fully myself again. My chronic pain kept getting to me. etc etc. Opiates are the only thing that help my injury/spinal related pain and because of my age it's fucking impossible for me to get anything from doctors. I'm a metalhead with all sorts of piercings, i'm 24, every doctor automatically assumes i'm drug seeking and is hesitant to give me anything at all. I used to go to a Pain management clinic and got 120 5mg vics and 60 10mg oxycodones per month but I stopped taking those and moved out of stated years back and haven't been able to set up a new plan with a new doctor. Either every doctor is too pussy footed to help me because my age/appearance makes me look like a drug seeker, despite my documented medical history, or, I just lost the patience to deal with the health care system and give up trying to get relief through the normal routes. 

So I just started ordering from the darknet over a year ago. 

Everything is functioning perfectly in my life. And has been solidly for 12 months straight. 

I never use H for more than 10 days out of each month. And use kratom for maintenance to not have to deal with WDs and to be able to kill pain at the same time. 

Sometimes you just need something stronger to feel good/really get at the pain. 

It's just so good to be honest. All those years where H was destroying my life and now I've got it by the reigns. 

I know that everyone's going to tell me it's a dangerous game and that sooner or later i'll fall through the cracks, but i've been there already, and I sincerely don't see it happening. Because every time I've been unable to afford it, well, that's it, I just can't afford it and I move on and wait a few more weeks til I can. 

All my bills are paid and current. I've been successfully paying off debt, and now through all of this, i'm also able to get my beautiful girlfriend the engagement ring she deserves. 

I just want to say thank you to all the amazing people on this sub, you guys are amazing and I absolutely love seeing and sharing all the stories we post here. This is my second home and has been for years. 

So with all that said. I just wanted to say I'm pain free, high as a kite, and going to be able to enjoy my memorial day weekend to the fullest. I wish every single one of you the best this weekend, and every other day moving forward. 

I never thought i'd make it this far and accomplish so much, and I know there is so many more of you out there who feel/felt the same way. Don't let that doubt consume you. You can do it. Whether you're detoxing, or trying to successfully balance an opiate usage and a ""normal"" life, it's possible, and you can find success.

If you're the kind of addict I am, you lead a life where the vast majority of people you interact with on a day-to-day basis will never understand or relate to some of the feelings and actions that absolutely drive us, and that we feel every day. 

There are some that are pretty commonly mentioned here, like when you are too sick to even fucking move but man hits you with that ""gud cum thru"" and you suddenly can not only drive, but expertly weave through traffic like Speed Racer racing on speed. I wanna know: what are some of those less talked-about opi feels that you think we can relate to? I have a couple off the top of my head.

1. Itching the SHIT (heh) out of your anus directly. Either with toilet paper protection, or just saying fukkit and going in like me before a eye-opening run-in with the Gon-Tron: bareback and unafraid with extensive washing after. Goddamn feels so GOOD.

2. Eating not because you're hungry, but because you just threw up so you know to enjoy more gear you're gonna need to shove *something* down your raw gullet. I'm doing this right now with some dank Chinese food. And I'm not talkin like a stoner, y'all...

Is it possible to purify or further isolate heroin in #4 form? I just received several gs of heroin that seems to be cut with a stimulant-like substance. 

I don't think it's another drug like meth or cocaine, because there's no euphoria with the rush. It simply increases my heart rate and throws me into a near-panic attack. I have a bad anxiety disorder, and the best way to describe it is like smoking weed, if weed makes you anxious and paranoid like it does me, with a hugely elevated heart rate. 

I have heard of a common cut that feels like a stimulant before, but I can't remember what it's called. 

I'm hoping there's a way to isolate the dope but I am already pretty certain you can't do that without some advanced lab equipment, haha. I know you can sometimes purify it and separate it from the non-soluble cut, but this is probably a different process?

I'll give you two blues if you come through and do it."" A couple of days later when I was finally able to come through and help, I spoke to Ben on the phone prior to verify some details. In fact, two nights earlier we also spoke on the phone. I asked him to clarify exactly what he wanted me to do to these phones for his sister.

Does the phones need to have a carrier unlock performed? As in, making an AT&T phone work on T\-Mobile or is there a passcode that he wishes to circumvent? That night he said, ""I'll call my sister, find out and call you back."" Two hours later... ""I guess you forgot about me, let me know if you can meet up tomorrow afternoon tot ake care of this.""

&nbsp;

Forgot about him? When we left off he said that he'd call me back to answer my two questions. The following day when we spoke, he did not have answers to those questions. So prior to coming over I told him that I didn't want to waste my time coming over only to find out there's nothing I can do nor do I want to come unprepared. He told me that he would pay me for my time regardless of the outcome.

&nbsp;

He said it, whether I fix it or not he will pay me what was initially promised to be two blues and a smoke\-up. When I got there he turned up with the wax so he fulfilled that part of the bargain. He also provided me with half a blue while I did my work.

&nbsp;

There is a third type of unlock which I did also try to find out about when we spoke on the phone the night before. Activation lock, or Find My iPhone \(FMIP\) lock which is practically impossible to circumvent. After a restore the device asks you to sign into iCloud, which cannot be bypassed.

&nbsp;

Mind you, when I spoke to this dude on the phone prior, he said he'd pay me whether or not I was successful but even if I was 100&#37; successful, he did not have two whole blues to give me on the spot. Maybe if I had succeded he would've gotten a credit from the person he gets blues from but I doubt it since he wasn't willing or able to do that with the guarantee I'd pay the following day.

&nbsp;

Thus instead of getting paid two blues, I got half a blue. Totally not worth my time. It was okay bonding time I suppose. I didn't cover Ben's melodrama, like when I told him I on the phone that I wanted more detail so that I wouldn't waste his time paying me to do something that couldn't get done. At the time he still assured me he'd pay me regardless and thanked for looking out and not scamming him by triyng to give him a heads up that paying me could very well be a waste since I didn't have enough info from him to know if I could do what was needed.

&nbsp;

Furthermore, he went into a melodramatic tangent where he listed situations where he'd have my back, things like a ""a place to stay if I was locked out"" or something about ""jiggas runnin up"" on me and backing me up in such a situation.

&nbsp;

In conclusion, if someone wants you to unlock an iPhone and isn't forthcoming with information, they probably didn't look into it too deeply and the device is probably activation locked.",1527291882.0

I grabbed him and he pushed back, after a struggle he got away and I tried for a second to hit him with my car but there were other cars around. 

The previous time on 4/20, a guy grabbed the cash & contraband and tried to make off. I pulled back and he THREW me to the sidewalk and ran, fracturing my ankle and people nearby had to carry me to a safe place. 

Physically ill be okay. Mentally I am traumatized. Ive never felt in physical danger before and have always been good about how I conduct my deals. I even have people with me/watching me when possible. But I'm scared of this town now. Both of these guys were recommended to me by friends, who told me I could trust them. 

Did these guys just see me as vulnerable? Was I too nice? I'm not a small girl, I can certainly look intimidating. I'm sure guys experience this shit too, but... Idk. Idk. 

Now I feel like I can trust no one. I've always felt that way, but never more than now. I'm so scared. I feel violated and angry and I want revenge. 

Why are people so fucked up? What fucking fiend does this shit. This town is becoming dirtier and dirtier.

While they were kicked out they were given access to the car and are still allowed to return to the house due to my parents fear of them being on the streets, however when he comes over he openly uses in the home and brings stolen merchandise that he spends his days/nights obtaining. He's not allowed to stay the night but it has happened as my parents invite him over during late hours where they don't stay up to enforce his removal. My brothers behavior remains toxic as he persistently questions my parents for money to ""help him out,"" and where his misplaced stolen merchandise may be. It was a almost impossible feat it felt to witness my parents finally muster the courage to kick him out of the house but my brothers incessant pestering of my parents for things they shouldn't have to deal with anymore seem to have allowed him to return to the home and allowed the toxic environment to continue. What should we do?

TLDR: Brother was kicked out of home due to heroin and meth addiction after violent behavior, he is still able to return to the home due to parents innate fear of him failing on the streets but he openly uses in it and also continues to bring stolen merchandise into it for storage.

Hell yeah I know someone. I can buy a few and save them for a rainy day. A day where I have shit to do and my pain levels are severe. I‚Äôve still got a little of my tram script left and I‚Äôve got some Kratom. Not even gonna touch those oxys for a couple weeks. 

Well it‚Äôs been a few months since I‚Äôve had oxy, having a little just to reminisce would be a kind thing to do to myself, right? I‚Äôve worked hard lately, I deserve it. Just a couple. That‚Äôll leave me with ten, plenty for when I really need them. 

Fuuuuuuuck mutherfucker these feel fucking good. I‚Äôm wrapped up in an internal blanket of the perfect temperature, everything in my shitty life is perfect. 

Hmmmm maybe I‚Äôll chop up another line for the morning. I‚Äôll wait till the morning, yeah. Oh this line looks so pristine. Just a little sniff. Whoops, my straw just kept going. Fuck this feels good.

I can say I'm done with it, I feel like I'm done with it, after getting on H I don't even think about oxy anymore, it doesn't do it for me anymore anyway as I don't like the itchy high it gives.
Over the weekend I'll use this as sparingly as possible and once it's done I am done. Hopefully forever. 
I've been testing the w/d boundaries and it looks like I'll be good since I'm on such a low dose just to maintain I can handle going without it without much discomfort. Last time I skipped 2 days beginning of this week and only got chills and sweats for an hour or two and they were mild, and some stomach cramping which a couple of lopes calmed right down. 
So I think I'm ready. Finally.

Choosing to act like the shit that I was and choosing not to be better because. Because why? Am I evil? Am I not worthy of people? See this is all you talking causing upheavel.

Right from inside it spreads out far and wide like a disease you ride through my body and fuck with my mind you make my knees freeze and my brain melt like cheese

So fuck your thoughts and deadly suggestions I have my own rules I don't need you asking questions I don't need your opinions your hate or your reasons my life I'ma live it you're fucked learn your lessons

8m002v,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8m002v/heroin_before_all/,8,https://redd.it/8m002v,Mathofakko,Heroin before all.,"I'm addicted. Everyone said I'd get addicted. I said I'd stop.

I never stopped though... I'm truly sorry.

I don't know how big the addiction is atm. I'm 19. It appears that I'm physically addicted now, it's been more than a month daily and nearly 2 months since my first time. Had a longer withdrawal yesterday lasting about 24hrs and I had to take small doses before I ran out. I could barely breathe, walk, my entre body was hurting, especially my back and legs. My heart was going crazy.

I was psychologically addicted instantly as I quitted my alcohol+speed addictions and benzos which I started taking everyday with the alcohol and speed, right before I started with H. I have big problems with my mental health, never gotten any diagnosis, never been ""analysed/evaluated"" by a therapist though.

During my withdrawal yesterday, I lost my cash with no dope, my girlfriend nearly broke up during a phone call. I was so pumped with adrenaline and turned extremely aggressive, I strongly felt like started destroying everything around me. It was bad, I was not myself. It seemed like a mild psychosis.

Nowadays I put heroin as my top priority. Fuck eating/drinking. Fuck sleep. Fuck taking a shower. Fuck school (Dropped out, before H though). Fuck meeting friends. Fuck having a normal life.

Fuck everything, I need to get some fucking heroin first!

Then I can try focus on getting my life together..

Wait, fuck, I need to get cash before I go empty in 3 days. Busy life I see.. At least I can get some relief in all this..

I honestly don't know what to do anymore. If I quit H, I'll just feel like shit and still have my mental problems, which H can ""cure"", at least for now. I'll fall back on a big growing polydrug addiction which is way more damaging in my eyes, and those aren't even that effective.

Not looking for sympathy if anyone thinks so. Just advice and stuff. If there even is a way.. I just feel lost.. I need help...",1527234531.0
