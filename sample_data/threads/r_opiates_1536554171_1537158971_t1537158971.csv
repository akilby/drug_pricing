Often times, doctors are ready to write you a prescription. One of their first choices for pain are opioids. The most common are OxyContin, Vicodin, and Codeine. Many get prescribed these for legitimate reasons, but some people game the system. The people looking for opioids for non-legitimate reasons often use them for depression, anxiety, and emotional numbness because of situations.

I‚Äôm first going to expose how easy they are to get. I went to the podiatrist, and after an operation, he gave me a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine. I knew this was a drug of abuse, so I only used them whenever I really needed them. I maybe took 5 out of the bottle of 30 over a span of months. I could‚Äôve easily gotten addicted to these, so that was the reason I used them as sparingly as possible.

The media has recently given us information on why opioids are so often being abused. They have made statements that they are being used by addicts for depression. I‚Äôve read that opioids have ¬®a general numbing effect on both the body and mind¬®. If you are going through rough patches of depression, it may seem like these drugs are perfect for you; they aren‚Äôt. ¬®Some addicts gain tolerance and need more and more¬®. This easily leads to an overdose, and ¬®you can overdose much more easily if you take opioids with alcohol¬®.

Mainstream media has also said that people use opioid painkillers to eradicate feelings of anxiety. Being that painkillers also numb emotions, people think it‚Äôs a good reason to take opioids. ¬®Any use other than using painkillers for pain is considered abuse¬®. Addiction can easily take over anybody, but people with anxiety that have access to opioids and also have no self-control, is a recipe for addiction. 

It‚Äôs scary how fast a doctor is to write you a prescription for opioids. ¬®Many people get addicted even if they are legitimately being used for pain¬®. On the other spectrum, there are the people who abuse them. Popular opioids such as OxyContin and Vicodin are all too frequently being misused by people who have emotional problems. People suffering from anxiety and depression with open access to opioids are at ¬®high risk for addiction and dependence¬®. One last note, if you get hooked and run out, ¬®withdrawal is painful and could be deadly¬®.

That happened probably about 6 years ago and was in a back brace for a year straight. Im a very physically active individual and it hurt about Everytime I did something I used to enjoy doing, kayaking for just one example. Pain where I would barely leave the house anymore. Looked into CBD and what not because I'm not a fan of pills.  

So I moved to Colorado when I was 19 to get my mmj card to hopefully help start being able to do the things I love and it worked for the most part. I still can't do all the things I love because CBD only helps so much and it makes me sleepy as hell making me not even want to be active the reason I am even taking it! 

I found kratom and that has helped a little bit but half the time it doesn't help at all. It gives me the motivation to go hiking and rock climbing and helps counteract the CBD tiredness somewhat. But it's getting expensive taking CBD daily and not knowing if Ill even have the energy or pain relief to be able to go for my jog up the mountain that afternoon. 

I live in the outdoors in the Rocky mountains where I can go for a hike and climb in my back yard. I've been able to manage so far with that type of stuff and my self prescribed kratom and medicinal CBD..as much as I can, it still hurts. 

Well I just got a great job where I can actually work and not have to be sitting behind a desk all day but unfortunately this job has some lifting requirements, I lift 50-100 lb concentrators and repair and clean them. Oxygen concentrators like to help people breath and repair and lift liquid oxygen cylinders weigh sometimes 170lbs. I absolutely love my job, I have been there for 3 or 4 weeks now.

 But this last week we had a huge order for about 150 60lb concentrators I loaded into the back of our box truck. I'm not one to complain and able to shrug things off, I am probably the strongest guy in our warehouse of workers and can lift heavy things all day but this last week I took my kratom, my CBD, but I couldn't do it. I tried my hardest and did all the work but at the end of the day I was about to pass out from the pain in my lower back it hurt so bad. 

I'm not damaging my back because at night it feels fine just while im lifting the concentrators about every time my back is in excruciating pain. I absolutely love my job and Its extremely hard to find a good job here especially at my age I'm not about to give this up. But does anyone have any ideas to help me be able to be more physical without the pain? Ideas on what I can do in my situation? It's terrible being 22 and having back issues. Nobody at works know, I play it off like I'm not in pain. 

I take Aleve and what not as well and i don't even notice a difference, does this mean I need to take some sort of prescription pain killer that I've tried so hard to avoid but is it just unavoidable now under my circumstances? Should I see a doctor?

Any advise is welcome or comments. Thanks for the read and I pray I can figure something out, I can't leave this job. ",1537152566.0

My last Suboxone use was today 8mg with ‚Äútapering‚Äù days in between.
And my last dose of Klonopin was about 5-6 days ago roughly 2mg; my last dose of Valium was 4-5 days ago at 40mg.

Now I‚Äôve read that Benzodiazepines (such as the ones I‚Äôm on) can take 4-6 weeks to fully get ride of the
 *drug metabolites* to be able to pass a urine test. 
Now I don‚Äôt know how true or not that is but I‚Äôve been put on Ativan at the age 13, went on Valium a little over a year ago, and added Klonopin in less than a year ago.

Now the thought of losing my whole future to my past drug abuse to opioids/being on maintenance medication really, really scares the hell out of me.

It contains a powder. So I decided to just ingest the powder by sucking it. Powder has a larger surface area-volume ratio, so it acts faster, 

I‚Äôve heard that snorting pills wastes a lot of it, as the bioavailability is crap. When taken orally, oxycodone has a bioavailability between 60-87%. Injected, it‚Äôs 100%. But I don‚Äôt know what the intranasal is? 

Either way, I can feel the extra potency of swallowing the powder alone. 

I take mine for chronic pain. But my doctor is tapering me, because they believe opioids are bad for chronic pain. Worked brilliantly, when I was at the right dose. Now I‚Äôm barely functioning, and struggle to walk. 

I‚Äôm wanting to make sure I use every mg efficiently. 

I‚Äôm considering either hanging around a known place, where #4 is used, once I‚Äôm off my pain meds, or can‚Äôt cope with the pain from extra cuts. It‚Äôs either that, or going to a methadone/suboxone clinic. 

I feel like telling my doctor, that they‚Äôre pushing me to consider extreme avenues. But that could lead to me being completely cut off, and forced into detox.

Ended up having to stay in hospital for over a week because I'd aspirated so much spew that without constant supplementary oxygen I was in danger of hypoxia, I was on IV antibiotics and a constant drip of saline because I somehow had an acute kidney injury from dehydration (I was lying on the ground for almost four hours before I was found, I have no idea how I'm alive. Just lucky someone was in the house and heard the death rattle and came to check on me). I also managed to fuck my face up by lying on it for almost four hours, luckily it wasn't broken but I had a lot of soft tissue damage and my jaw swelled to the point where I couldn't even open my mouth wide enough to fit a sandwich in. It was incredibly painful and obviously the docs wouldn't give me anything stronger than paracetamol.

&#x200B;

Anyway, as soon as I got out of hospital I was back to smoking a gram of H a day. Did that for a few months, then a couple of months ago, on a whim, I went to my local needle exchange and got a goody bag. I'm deathly afraid of needles but it was scarily easy to jam the needle into the crook of my arm and from then on I was off to the races. (Please do not start injecting heroin on a whim, it is a lot easier than you think and once you get it good luck stopping)

&#x200B;

(Now we finally get to the point)

&#x200B;

So I'd been using the vein in the crook of both elbows (think it's called the medial something something vein), but I was starting to get a fair amount of scar tissue, to where it started worrying me because it was difficult to get the spike in, so I decided to hit the back of my hand. Obviously I missed and now I have a bump that's about 3cm in diameter and feels like I have a golf ball under my skin. It doesn't hurt, I've been to a doctor and shown them it and they said it looks OK right now but to keep an eye on it. That was last week though and there's been no improvement or worsening. I'm just worried it's going to get infected, which would suck because I've been clean for almost two weeks. Just when I think I'm out, they drag me back in.

&#x200B;

But nobody really talks about a muscle relaxer that is also antihistamine I have mentioned in the past that is good for potentiating opiates. 

This otc medication is called orphenadrine. Based on multiple studies it can be used to ease withdrawal. Has been reported to give slight euphoria and when taken in conjunction with opiates patients have reported it helps the opiate ""find the pain better"" meaning orphenadrine in conjunction with opiates increases the analgesic relief.  

I took a few days off methadone mainly for a  bit of a tolerance break and this eased the hot and cold sweats and sick feelings really effectively. Also a 200mg dose at bed time really assisted sleep. Just thought I would mention it because I havent seen it on guides for opiate withdrawl before. ",1537120734.0

I usually don't dream at all when using, but it seems to really be on the nights I am cutting back or trying to slow down.

As a kid I was always into sports - soccer, baseball, basketball.. and my family, esp my dad, was always so supportive. Had a few coaches along the way that were so incredible a few turned out being like family to me, as well as my parents. I never even stumbled onto pills until after I had graduated high school, right before college. Its been so many years now.. 8 or 9.. that its really become my life (as would be putting so much time into anything for a decade). Really been struggling lately to break it off for real and for good, even though I see it within reach - a decent car, saving money, I actually have pretty much come to 0 on my debts and bills. I need to just take that extra push and save all of a few of my paychecks and I will be right where I need to be.

So onto the point, I've been having these surreal, vivid dreams where I am very young, about 10, at a sports tournament.. but I can never seem to get the strength to even get past the pre-game talk I am so focused on trying to get dope so that I am able to play. The first one was an indoor soccer tournament and I was struggling so hard to get the money together it was pure panic and I woke up before being able to. Next, a basketball one where this time was waiting on a dealer that I woke up before he ever came. Now last night was a baseball tournament where, with a coach that is like a father to me, I gave up defeat admitting to him and my parents there that I needed help and couldn't do it anymore. But that to play in the tournament I just needed to get well right then and that I was so sick my body was dying.

It's crazy and drugs were never, ever on my radar until much longer in life.  But my body combining the good, younger days, with this devil I've been caught under for almost the past decade. It really blows my mind how smart our brains are as humans, if we could only access more of it.",1537114841.0

So around 5 months ago I was really sick and had bronchitis I think and in my country the cough medicine (prescribed) is heavily regulated and I've tried to get it couple times when I had minor cough and the doctors don't prescribe it.

&#x200B;

Its good shit, there was 3.10 mg of codeine per 1 ML, and I had a 200 ML bottle. So the whole bottle had more than 600mg codeine and it also had efedrine 1.25mg/ml and a little bit of alcohol like cough syrups do.

I took a 30 ML dose, so around 30mg of codeine and I already felt a little effect, not much but at least my cough went away. I decided to redose and took 30mg more, so now im at 60mg. I got a little more itchy and more of a body high, and I felt a lot more positive. 30mg more and I already felt pretty high. My body was feeling really good, I was able to focus on   a game I was playing and music sounded pretty fucking good. Only on 90mg.

Highest I did was 120mg and that had me on my bed doing nothing but listening to music, whole body feeling just perfect. I remember trying to eat or drink and it all tasted shit I just wanted to relax. I also got itchy as fuck, but I didnt bother me.

Left my ex some time ago and we haven‚Äôt spoken much about anything for a year. Recently let him back into my life and see how completely addicted he has become. Carrying drugs and needles and spoons in his lunch box, doing meth just to wake up every morning, shooting up H at work idk how many times a day or night. Mixing it sometimes.. the ‚Äúgoofball‚Äù or whatever it‚Äôs called. I don‚Äôt know all of  it. He told me he‚Äôs overdosed 8 times. He acts like he did it on purpose. He says he knows how much he can handle and he wont overdose again. the first day I was with him was good but he got a little weird/paranoid. It scared me a little because the things he was saying was just so off and not like him. The second day he was in a great mood, talkative, loving. The third day I had to care for him 4+ hours during what I thought could end up as an overdose, I took care of him as well as I could. 

In the beginning, before we split, he had a severe alcohol problem. or so I thought but it was actually cocaine as well, I had no clue. It has apparently progressed to this. And continues worsening. 

I told him I can‚Äôt have him around as it is just too dangerous. I told him I love him. I told him I‚Äôll support him in any efforts he‚Äôd make for recovery and getting the help he needs and taking steps to go into rehab, etc. he said he‚Äôll go to rehab Monday. (tomorrow) I doubt he‚Äôs going to go, he said he can‚Äôt do inpatient. I didn‚Äôt ask him to go or anything but That‚Äôs what he said. He begged me not to leave him. I feel like he‚Äôs desperately reaching out for help but doesn‚Äôt want to quit. 

Last night he said that he has nothing else to live for so he doesn‚Äôt see the point in quitting. He said if he had his kids back then he‚Äôd quit. I told him how backwards that it is. He was using heroin for the little time while they were in his care anyways and he lost them for that reason. That‚Äôs just his addiction talking I know but it breaks my heart and I fear he will die soon. I‚Äôm very concerned but what else can I do. Nothing. It‚Äôs such a bummer. He was my best friend, the only man I have ever loved. He has a lot of potential. But I feel that he isn‚Äôt even a person anymore. Just an empty shell of what he used to be. 

He‚Äôs been using H for a year and he‚Äôs lost everything. His wife. Kids. House. All his money. A couple cars. His job. His freedom. He looks really sick. Everything is gone to the point where he is homeless and luckily now he‚Äôs at least able to sleep on a floor at a friends house and find a ride to work. Like at one point does anyone decide to quit? I am so scared that he‚Äôs going to die. He‚Äôs been at rock bottom for awhile. 

Anyways I just wanted to vent a little. I know this is the opiate group but I thought if anyone understood it would be you guys. I probably sound crazy or obsessed idk I‚Äôm just worried. Please delete if this kind of post isn‚Äôt welcome. I‚Äôm just going to continue to be here for him to talk to and I‚Äôll help him if i can but I don‚Äôt wanna get myself involved in this disastrous cycle he‚Äôs in. ",1537103105.0

TL:DR- Want to ask psych to up dose from 90 to 120 bars (max prescribed dose) per month and also an adderall prescription.  Should I ask for both at the same appointment? Or should I ask for one of those things at a time between two appointments? 

Background: Okay so I first started seeing this psych after multiple people I knew went to him and had success. First appt I walked out with a script for 90 2mg xanax a month. This was back in October of 2016. Over the time since then i had asked and he switched me to klonopin 6 mg/day and another time he switched me to Valium 30 mg/day at my request. When I asked to go back on xanax he in so many words said it‚Äôs 100% up to me which one I want and he didn‚Äôt care. So I went back on 90 bars a month back in February. Now I know he‚Äôs prescribed people adderall and xanax before but I don‚Äôt think they were prescribed as high a dose as I am. My reservations for asking to up my xanax dose are that it‚Äôs already pretty fucking high and 120 would be the max he could rx. My reservation for asking for adderall is I‚Äôm not confident he would go for it. Worst he could say is no but I‚Äôm wondering if I should ask for both an increase and the addy script in the same appt or if I should ask for one before the other and in what order. Honestly this doc is very liberal I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he prescribed oxy for neuropathy or some shit.

Just wondering if anyone has advice on how/if the timing to ask for these things matters",1537082108.0
9g8gma,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9g8gma/i_had_an_intervention_by_a_felis_silvestris_catus/,27,https://redd.it/9g8gma,WeirdOneTwoThree,I had an intervention by a Felis silvestris catus and now my world has been turned upside down. I now really need to but I‚Äôm very afraid: Should I tell my wife?,"TLDR: My lifetime supply of fentanyl was lost in a freak accident and now I have to start subs which are only available daily in the methadone line at the pharmacy so my dear wife is sure to find out sooner or later, asking if I should tell her and more importantly the best way to do so if I must?

It‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been troubling me a lot more than usual lately: I‚Äôm a secret addict. I apologize for the length of this post but as much as I appreciate people‚Äôs opinions and find the collective consciousness of this forum very helpful, I don‚Äôt think your opinion will be as helpful to me as it perhaps could be if it isn‚Äôt based on the right context and considerations so a little background is really required.

I went to seek help and told an addictions counsellor about my problem (quite a few months ago now)  but before that there was absolutely no one in the world (except for random people on the Internet like yourself who is currently reading this) that knew anything of my problem. I‚Äôve been opioid dependant off and on for 30 years but it‚Äôs gotten worse in the last couple of years and I‚Äôve been dependant 100% of the time in the last year. I used opioids to control depression on an as required basis for 30 years but 15 years ago when I was married it had been at least 10 years of nothing, no opioids or depression so I really thought I was done with it at the time. 

It‚Äôs almost a cliche that I ended up using heroin as a less expensive alternative to prescription medication and more recently when that became too expensive to be sustainable I started using pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. Several years ago my heroin started testing positive for fentanyl but I had no choice to use it (carefully). As I was using fentanyl anyways, even if I didn‚Äôt want to, it only made a certain amount of sense to investigate and learn if I could use it more directly. While far from ideal for my purposes it is better for me than heroin in so many ways and it is of course a lot less expensive than daily heroin (pennies per dose).

In the beginning (over 30 years ago) I was pretty naive and seriously believed I had the flu the first couple of times I got dope sick.  It was so long ago I don‚Äôt really remember now but I would remember having run out of what I needed and that just wasn‚Äôt the case because I remember those few times during which that happened very clearly. So I was dope sick and really had no idea, if I had only known I likely would have just dosed to abort the withdrawal syndrome but I hadn‚Äôt yet connected the dots (30 years ago) that I had become dependent, rather I had just stopped using by choice to see if my depression would return and coincidentally thought I got the flu at around the same time.

I‚Äôve never directly lied to my wife unless you count not telling her about my increasingly serious problem with opioid dependency as a lie or the fact that I suffered from depression some 10 years before we met but hadn‚Äôt had any trouble since as a lie which I know some people absolutely will. If she ever directly asked me in such a way that it was not possible to give her a truthful answer without lying I‚Äôm know I would tell her the truth. It was really difficult for this addictions counsellor to understand how I could have the problem for so long and no one knew but here‚Äôs the thing, I don‚Äôt get high, I just dose enough when I have to that sends my depression into full remission (almost as effective as a light switch) and then I would simply stop dosing, usually well before dependence developed.

I have some insight into how she might react to this (very badly) because not long after we were married (and before the depression returned) I had a problem with alcohol dependence (fortunately dependence and not addiction, there is a difference) which developed after my parents both died and I was stupidly using alcohol as a sleep aid. While this alcohol dependence was developing, my wife would never forget to prepare a rather stiff drink for me at bedtime, to help me sleep. She was as naive as I was about the danger. I would drink only at bedtime, wake up the next morning renewed and refreshed go off to work without fail.

Eventually one evening I came to my senses and resolved to stop doing this to my liver as the amount required to help me to sleep was ever increasing and clearly getting out of control but it was already too late, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. I started to sweat and soon developed nausea, vomiting and a rapid heart beat.  Sitting in front of my computer at 4 or 5 AM (dial up modem Internet in those days) and trying to figure out what was wrong with me I researched my list of symptoms and ‚ÄúAlcohol Withdrawal Syndrome‚Äù appeared on my monitor. I remember I sat there frozen and in a daze, staring at it for the better part of an hour before it sank in that this was likely what was wrong. The means to confirm my amateur diagnosis was pretty simple so I drank some gin and very soon felt much better. The next day I couldn‚Äôt believe how stupid I had been to allow this to progress so far. I researched how to fix it, obtained the required amount of valium (diazepam) to substitute for alcohol, created a spreadsheet with a taper protocol to dose a slowly decreasing amount of diazepam every 6 hours over the course of 7 days (5 was recommended as sufficient but I wanted to be sure) and had the serious talk with my wife as to what had happened and how we were going to fix it. She wanted me to go to inpatient detox but this was exactly what they would do for me there and I didn‚Äôt want the embarrassment of anyone else in the world knowing how badly I had screwed up or how stupid I had been.  I had lots of paid sick time at my job and anything less than 10 concurrent days didn‚Äôt require a medical certificate but I still used vacation time to do this as I didn‚Äôt feel I should be taking paid sick time to treat a self inflicted wound. I took a week off from work and she was a trooper, waking me up and giving me the medication I had self prescribed in strict accordance with the protocol over the next week. After it was over, I went to a good number of AA meetings at my wife‚Äôs request but I simply couldn‚Äôt relate to the people there, I wasn‚Äôt an alcoholic and had no urge to drink, rather I had just become alcohol dependant because of my ignorance and no longer was but my wife was absolutely terrified. Only after we went on a number of Caribbean vacations where all inclusive (already included or free) alcohol was excessively abundant and she noticed that I drank responsibly did she seem to stop worrying herself sick that I was an incurable alcoholic. 

A couple of years after we had put this behind us my depression returned which was obviously very disturbing to me but I knew what I could do about it and of course I did. Perhaps the relative ease at which I had put alcohol dependence behind me played a role here as well. Ok, not perhaps, it definitely did. I was still very naive and probably felt at the time that if I did become dependent on opioids I could simply replace it with something else or slowly taper down the dose and leave it behind me as easily as I did with alcohol and even as I had been able to do with opioids in the past but of course I was incredibly stupid and obviously very wrong, fentanyl is a quite a very different animal.

As I started to realize the amount of money I was spending I starting taking steps to bring that under control. I learned that I could dose a lot less and still not be depressed. I was able to make what I had last longer. Of course like anyone, my tolerance increased and eventually the pills got too expensive and like so many I turned to heroin. I remember one of my early experiences with the wonderful warm euphoria of heroin and thinking ""If this is all I ever get out of this life I might be fine with that"". I really didn‚Äôt get high very often. Sometimes I would go through several grams of heroin without getting high even once. Getting high wasn‚Äôt important to me -- having my life back was and I really found heroin too sedating. If I did push enough heroin to cause euphoria it was very short lived because all I wanted to do was to take a nap. I suppose if I hadn‚Äôt found heroin so sedating it really could have got me with a serious addiction but I really didn‚Äôt like it because of how tired it makes me feel. At some point all my new batches of heroin started testing positive for fentanyl. I really had no choice but to use them carefully and as I was using fentanyl even if I didn‚Äôt want to I started to investigate if it could be helpful directly. Eventually my tolerance increased and the heroin got too expensive so I started dosing pure fentanyl hydrochloride directly. It was a lot less expensive than daily heroin. It also isn‚Äôt useful for getting high (perhaps some of the analogs are but not fentanyl itself) but just using it (without getting high) was sufficient to keep me singing with the radio and not depressed.

When I met with an addictions counsellor I found out to my great dismay that In order to get into the buprenorphine program I have to give up my job (because it requires me to be able to fly the friendly skies) and that‚Äôs a pretty big decision I can‚Äôt make without involving my wife but I know from past experience that she will react badly and be worried and terrified all over again and I‚Äôm really having a hard time bringing myself to do that to her.

In my country, suboxone is treated the same way as methadone with no difference. I will have to go to the same pharmacy every day for the remainder of my natural life. After three months I will be able to get two additional doses friday for use on the weekend but the strict monitored dosing and urine testing goes on forever. The program costs something like $40/day in my area which is $14,600/year and without a job that‚Äôs a lot of money. There is just no way I get to disappear everyday at the same time for very long before my wife figures it out or worse jumps to the entirely wrong conclusion (she is always encouraging me to ‚ÄúGet a Girlfriend‚Äù but just the same that‚Äôs only because she wants what is best for me and I really think she‚Äôd be hurt if she knew I actually had one).

I know that my tolerance for fentanyl is increasing because it does take more now to control the depression and I also have some pain (likely from opioid-induced hyperalgesia) and I don‚Äôt want to continue dosing fentanyl for years.  I have only a small supply remaining and it is rapidly getting harder and much more risky to obtain (really impossible, not for lack of trying). 

The Intervention

Handling and mixing pure fentanyl hydrochloride is very dangerous. The amount required to keep me well for a week is pretty hard to see and doesn‚Äôt look like much of anything with the naked eye. To make it safer and easier to handle and mix precisely, I had dissolved my entire inventory into an aqueous solution, 1 liter of bacteriostatic water mixed with fentanyl hydrochloride to a concentration of 5mg/ml, so that one bottle was just about 10,000 strong doses or really a lifetime supply. This was usually stored safely in a cabinet in my office, the one room my wife knows to leave be (she knows she can do as she pleases to the entire rest of the house) and there are no children in our home. I stupidly left it out on the counter for a short time after mixing the required amount for the next two weeks (every two weeks I reduce by 5% when I am tapering) because I got interrupted before I finished. The door to the office must not have latched completely and one of my wife‚Äôs cats got in and knocked it off the counter. In a freak accident, it landed mostly upside down. The problem wasn‚Äôt discovered for several hours and 98% of it leaked into the thick pile carpet where it was unretrievable. Obviously, I am the world's dumbest idiot for leaving it out and not making sure the cap was on more tightly. In any event, the lifetime supply had become a couple of months supply and that was a couple of months ago.  I have spent quite a bit of time and effort trying to replace it but that is simply not meant to be.

I have been coasting along the last couple of months, dosing fentanyl each and every day but never enough to get high and tapering as much as possible and I am becoming increasingly aware that this simply isn‚Äôt going to end well. I know I allowed this to happen and I have to accept the consequences but I‚Äôm feeling pretty trapped and don‚Äôt know what to do. I know if I tell my wife she will either leave me or she will dig in and help but I‚Äôm really not sure which way she will go on that. With each passing day it becomes a slightly bigger problem. 

I know when I run out it will not be pretty, although I have been tapering as quickly as I can, there simply isn‚Äôt enough left to complete a taper and even if there was it‚Äôs likely my depression will return at some point (it pretty much always does when I am in acute withdrawal).  Suboxone is a better solution for me (stronger kappa which is associated with depression or rather the lack of it) according to the last 20 studies I have read on the matter.

Knowing this disaster is coming real soon now I‚Äôm not going down because I was too embarrassed, proud, or stupid to ask for help so I went to my Doctor and told him what was up. He was shocked of course, and then became very distressed and withdrawn saying he doesn‚Äôt want anything to do with it and referred me to the lady Doctor in change of the methadone program and I‚Äôm scheduled to start on that path next week. There is no heroin in my part of the world (just pills) and the stigma is so very strong here.

It‚Äôs a small town and as soon as I start standing in the methadone/suboxone line every morning she is going to know at some point. I know I can hold out for a while by picking a more distant pharmacy but it‚Äôs only a matter of time.  It‚Äôs easy to hide drug use when it has no effect on you (except the positive one of not having depression) but I can‚Äôt hide disappearing at the same time every day and not being able to travel for very long (the methadone Doctor said she‚Äôd call in prescriptions in distant cities for me but I simply don‚Äôt believe she can do that, I can‚Äôt even keep up with the travel schedule sometimes, it‚Äôs unrealistic to expect her to be able to). We have two cars but I still think it is wise to pick one within walking distance just incase. I know it‚Äôs likely better if she hears it from me but I‚Äôm losing my mind with worry that she will divorce me.  

Do you think I should tell her or just try my best for as long as I can not to get caught?  If you think I should tell her any thoughts on how best to do it (thus the reason for this crazy long dissertation so you know all the machinations)?  She was really frightened with the alcohol incident and to her (never having even seen heroin in her lifetime) this is likely to be much much worse.

The only comfort I have is I know that the end of my life will end my addiction (and my depression).",1537078183.0

Well, there are dozens of restaurants downtown that advertise ""happy"" food - which means they cook it with weed! Like, openly, advertising it on the signs and shit.

That lope is not absorbed well because the pills have magnesium stearate in them? This makes no sense because this is a common binder is pills of all sorts.

I told them call the d-boy and make sure I can get more bc I'll be out if I give y'all each a point. So Aaron called him and d-boy said yeah come through in 30. Roommate gave me cash for his point, and Aaron is supposed to give me 2 points out of his sack. Then Aaron gets stuck on the phone with his crazy ex, and once he gets off he says he just dropped acid. So I said ""bro wtf, I need to get my shit tonight."" And roommate told me ""you act like you'll go through withdrawal or some shit."" Like yeah, I will. He's tryna tell me that since I smoke it, withdrawal isn't a thing to me. And now since it's been 2 hours since Aaron called the d-boy, he's not answering. So I suggested let's go through my guy, and Aaron said fuck him, he's not getting my money. So I guess since they got what they wanted, fuck whatever I need. So now I'm out of dope, and they're concerned about a.) Tryna set up some nigga that just robbed them, and b.)

I decided to try to get medical attention as so many of you suggested and lucked out and found a free clinic. Was lucky bc they're only open 2 days a month and today was 1. Made it there just before they closed, they were taken aback by how bad of shape my foot was in. 
              I lied and told them a sliver of plastic got jabbed in and caused the infection. They checked tor abscesses then told me I have a severe bacterial infection raging in that foot that can cause sepsis and kill me. Said I needed antibiotics and a tetanus shot asap and wrote rxs for both and sent me on my merry way. 
          Turns out hearing a Dr tell me I can basically get sepsis any time and die is scary and since I was broke I began panhandling my ass off bc I spent all my $ partyin last night. Pride be damned I was getting those antibiotics. I was having pretty good luck showing ppl my foot and explaining how I needed $ for antibiotics or I might literally die from sepsis. Then my ride came and got me to take me to go get the antibiotics filled. Fuck the tetanus shot.
                On the way to the pharmacy my ride decides to stop at a waffle house to take a piss. When he's in there these 3 black dudes go in. 2 are enormous and dressed normally but there's a little dude wearing the most gold I've ever seen someone wear with them. A waitress comes running out all giddy to get something from her car and I asked who they are. She says 1 is a comedian. Like a dumbass I ask which comedian is it and she looks at me like the feverish dumbfuck I am (Dr said i had a 103 degree fever) and tells me Katt Williams. 
                Well my ride comes back out and I told him he just missed Katt Williams. He has no clue who that is. Then a stroke of luck befell me. Katt and his largest goon come outside to get something from the car. I tell my ride fuck it I'm trying. When the 2 of them headed back inside (and with his guard watching me like an angry hawk) I say ""hey guys could y'all help me . . . . "" and stopped midsentence bc the guard stared me in my eyes and shook his head as if to say ""a peasant doesn't speak unless spoken to"" but Katt silenced him easily by half raising 1 hand then walks over to me and asks what's up. I tell him about my foot and how I'm in danger of it killing me if I cant come up with these antibiotics and how I'm flat broke. He asks how much $ I need.  I figured I need $20 so I tell him $40 (I d love some extra for dope of course) . I'm a fiend after all. Without saying a word Katt walks back in waffle house with his goon following close behind. 10 seconds later I see the goon headed back to the door so I go meet him there. He hands me a brand new beautiful $100. I'm shocked. I tell him to tell katt thanks but he ignores me and walks back inside. I really wanted to thank Katt (and get a pic w him!) but I figured the nicest thing I could do would be leave the man be and go on my way. So that's what I did. 
           From there I went to the pharmacy where the pharmacist told me there's 2 types of doxycycline (antibiotics i was prescribed) and the Dr didn't specify which so they wouldn't fill it till they talked to the DR who'd already gone home for the day. The Dr who only works that clinic 2 days of every fucking month. I'm going to call the # on the rx first thing tomorrow and hope I'm lucky. 
                 I got home and did a speedball and wrote this up and now I'm going to do another and smoke a hookah of cherry shisha and hope for the best. I'll always have mad respect for Katt Williams.

Just like I have mad respect for a certain some1 who mailed me a care package to help my foot but I didn't get it bc it was stolen from the mailbox early this morning by this klepto piece of shit.

Thank you all for your concerns, prayers, well wishes, kind thoughts and nude pictures (lol jk  I haven't got any of those in quite a while c'mon ladies would it kill ya to show lobster a little love? = P) but seriously I dunno what I'd do without y'all and Dr made me promise to stay in bed and off my leg but I gotta get antibiotics sorted asap then I can keep weight off my foot and spend my time on Reddit and YouTube since I don't have cable or Netflix (cough cough I'd do dirty things in exchange for some1 letting me share some Netflix with them lol).

Well more like Fent is available. It scares the hell out of me seeing how much people are dying left and right now. 

The insane ammount of pills being pressed and sold as the users doc is also shocking. These piece of shit assclowns really have no heart. It breaks my soul every time I hear of another life ruined because of this shit and how common its become. 

A close friend of mine is a retired state trooper in his 70s now and has worked his entire life to leave his daughter (he has two other one is a deadbeat drunk and junkie that stole a big chunk of his life savings from his safe) that dead beat daughter that did that left the state with that money and never heard a thing back.

Note that shit daughter had a child of her own that he had to raise as his own from a young age. She is now an adult in her 20s and is serving in the navy. His good daughter that has done great most of her life was charged with selling some of her hydros to a girl she knew and apparently someone else sold a fent laced hydro 10 to the same girl and killed her. Both sellers were convicted of murder and had no bond. The trooper had to get a mortgage on his paid off house, empty all his savings to get a lawyer good enough to keep his good daughter from getting sentenced as she didnt sell the fake pills. 

So this state troopers has literally worked his entire life for NOTHING. He mopes around and for a man that use to be full of character is now basically dead. 

This shit is crazy and I thank god every day I got out of it in time. Its getting worse and worse. Please, if you are reading this get the fuck out of this stuff... And if you can't then do whatever it takes to get to a clinic.. Even if you were an addict to methadone for the rest of your life its worth not dying. And bupe is even better if you can. 

I recently heard from family my brother is constantly asking for pain meds when he knows people have it. It pisses me off he can't just see my example and the fucked up rock bottom shit I went through and stay away from the garbage.

So, I've been using Oxycodone (~ 200mg p.d) and generally add in a benzo (Temazepam/Diazepam/Flunitrazepam/Midazolam etc) or a gabapentinoid (Lyrica) if I want to get super chill. 

I've been using opiates/benzos/gabapentinoids and others recreationally for the past year and thoroughly enjoying my life üòä

One thing that I have never experienced is a nod. I hear people talk about this all the time but for me up until now, its never happened. 

Well, this morning I took 10mg Diazepam, 600mg Lyrica and 60mg Oxycodone, brewed myself some Blue Mountain and had a chill day. 

This evening, I had chosen a great Prime show to watch (Mr Robot), had pizza and then took my Saturday night dose.

So, 1,200mg Lyrica and 80mg Oxycodone down the hatch. (No benzo BTW, however I am aware that my morning dose of both Lyrica and Diazepam may still be active)

Well, I was watching the show with my sister and suddenly got a tap on the shoulder. 'youve missed most of the first episode?! lol)

Apparently, I had nodded off. I awoke half way through the second episode feeling great lol.

I am still feeling great now. I am very cautious when it comes to mixing benzos with opiates however less so with Lyrica.

I have once again been reminded of how wonderful Pregabalin is. I love it!

Anyway, that has been my evening so far.

I had a great high going but couldn't stop nodding. My boss just took it as I am just exhausted from all the work I've been doing. 

Just a few mins ago he asked me to come out side with him.  I didn't think much of it and wasnt worried about him questioning why I was so tired. 

He said he was amazed at the work I did. We were far behind the projects expected goal and the customer was starting to bitch.  He said he was so proud of me for getting us back on track even though it was taking so much of a toll on me.

Ok so anyway, this friend of mine (I use the term friend loosely) hit me up and mentioned he‚Äôs with his girl friend and she had 2 bags on her she was trying to sell, he said he‚Äôd sell it to me for $50. I jumped on it bc usually when I ask, he charges me double (we agreed on a mutual understanding that I‚Äôd buy him a bag if he could grab me one, because I don‚Äôt like going on the runs, so I have to trust that he comes back every time, and he always has so far. I think it‚Äôs fair - I‚Äôll buy you a bag if you can grab me one, right? Well then it somehow became $50 extra, than $100 extra, basically just pushing it as far as he can.) Usually when I grab a bag off him, I pay double + more. So anyway, back to the story... I sent him the $50, he came by, dropped the bag off, and then I start smelling it, doing it and mixing it up, and realize the dopes a little off perhaps? Now, this isn‚Äôt my usual dope from my normal guy. However, I have tried this dope once before. it looked the same pretty much but Idk, it just had a weird consistency in the spoon this time. Kind of looked like clear mucus, Idk, lot of tiny little clumps in it too. I torched it just incase, and then there were little particles left behind, which duh makes sense, that happens sometimes with certain shit. Whatever. I do it, doesn‚Äôt feel like all that, kinda ‚Äúeh‚Äù ‚Äúso-so‚Äù not a nice rush or anything, which it had done in the past. Did it once more and still same reaction - ‚Äúeh‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs alright.‚Äù Long story short - I‚Äôm wondering in the back of my head if it‚Äôs possible he put a little bit of baby powder or something in it to make it look like it‚Äôs more dope when it‚Äôs really not, ya know. I mean, why else would he be selling me a bag for $50 when usually he charges me double + some..?  I‚Äôm thinking, maybe he took some out for himself, mixed it with a little bit of baby powder, and sold me half or maybe less than half of a bag, and charged me $50. So for him, he‚Äôs basically making $50 off half a bag or less and then getting an actual hole bag for the same amount. Im very generous, but I‚Äôm even more skeptical. I have no idea what baby powder mixed with dope would even look like though? I tried googling it lol but uhhh... I cant really find nothin‚Äô for ‚Äúwhat does baby powder mixed with dope look like?‚Äù There‚Äôs nothing on here either, I checked! or maybe I didn‚Äôt look hard enough. 

Either way, do you know what baby powder mixed with dope looks like? Or how can you tell if ur dope is mixed with baby powder, or something of the sort? 

Any answers would be cool... Sorry I don‚Äôt have a pic... I did it all lol... and even if I do get any type of answers it‚Äôs all gone now... but for future reference it would be nice to keep an eye out for. ",1537057631.0

Went to the Dr's at 8 am on the Sunday, they checked me over and other than a low oxygen count he said I was fine and gave me some antibiotics, which I've saved for something useful(I get tonsillitis frequently). So this week I took the week off work to try and taper, costing a fortune in pay and feeling pretty bad about my poor attempy at stopping.

Today I decided to have a second attempt at it and I'm now getting that same chesty cough I had last week, I've got enough codeine to do a 50 % reduction over the week, back to work Monday no matter what. I feel stupid, I thought I was in control  and didn't do the smart thing and try a longer taper.

I know it's only codiene but I've not experienced this before, having done other drugs in my life, non have left me physically dependent like this, its quite amazing. 

I hope the chest thing is withdrawal and not something more serious, seems to be a lot of Tb coming to the UK from Asia etc.

about 5 min ago I snorted 3 big lines each about  .2- .3 of some good/fire dope, it was mixed. 2 lines were fire and 1 was real good dope but not such potent as the other two. I also took 2mg of etizolam which is the same as 1mg of Alprazolam. Thats what I learned here together with a bropiate. And I just wanted to thank you guys for. Everytime I come here I learn smth new or read some super interesting atory from someones day. I am more than grateful.that I am at the moment whether addicted to dope or to benzos. Thanks detox, mom, brother, friends and you guys for helping me staying ""sober"" I know that I sometimes use at the moment but it gets less and less everyday. Yesterday I had some real cravings while getting drunk with my friends and I didnt touched the dope just because of you teaching me how to handle cravings. I must say that I touched that night dope and snorted a .1 line but that was just because something really bad halpend to my best girlfriend amd I knew that dope will help me to forget it and that I can sleep and work today. I worked today 8 hours cutting trees, builiding walls(German walls with stones, IDK as far as I knoe most of you are from the USA and as far as I know there are most of the walls, not all, are made out of wood) so one stone has a weight of ca. 4kg and I lifted about 150-170 of them today. I am really groogy. But this day was a day where I didnt thought once about using because of the work keeping my head focused. And I didnt wanted that risk again doing such things with dope. The last time I did that while actively using and broke my arm and foot. So this was a great day. And I gave myself some small treat after such a hard day of musclework. I found a way with the help of you to do smth against my cravings its riding my bicycle. Thats great you helped me so often in the last 2 years when I was using and I sometimes asked some real stupid questions just because I was so high. Becauae of you I didnt started shooting dope. I just wanted to give you all a super big hug and a very grateful thank you for caring about me, listing to me if smth bad happened, just for every little thing you have done. This is a great Community and I never met any ppl here who were harsh or disrespectful. Ok there were some assholes too but they just said it like it needed to be said. And some dumb trolls but who cares about them. I send to everyone of you much love and respect for beeing the wonderful persons you are. You guys are great never forget that. If anyone needs help please pm me and I will.answer you and help you. Stay as you are and never let anybody tell you that you are scum or shit just because you are using. Its andisease and if you are ready you can start to fight against it. I will try the chipper way now a bit. Lets see. Maybe I am one of the thousand ppl who wont get addicted again and if I get addicted again I found a great way for me how to stop using. If anyone is interested in my way of detox that worked for me now 3 great times. I was 3 month clean before I relapsed the maximum amount I was sober in the 2 years before was one week and that was only because my dopeman got arrested and I am or was to shy and scarred to cold cop. So if anyone ever needs help just hit me up and we can write about everything. Even my PTSD got much better aince I stopped using now. So enough from my emotional post. I just had to get that off of my heart. I love you guys and gals. Stay safe. Please try to always carry narcan and not use alone like me and tell the others where your naloxone is. Its a lifesaver. I will always remember my one and gladfully only OD and I was alone and thank god I came back on my own. Always do a test bump or test shot. You can always take more not less and every life matters. Have a great day/night whatever time it is at yours. I will post some updates how it works out for me as a chipper and at the moment when I realize I am coming to near to addiction or am addicted again I will definitly get sober again. Thats for sure. Oh and I will write a book about a junkie in my age and in my country cause you can nearly find nothing about addicts in my age from my country. Only from the oldtimer junkies from the Heroin Epidemic in the 80s untill late 90s. So now its really enough from me you got better things to do than read this super long text.

That is, unlike injections of cocaine which produced a very distinct ""taste"" (I believe technically that it's a smell, since they say we only taste salty sweet, bitter, sour, and ""umami"" [Japanese word denoting tee sensation produced by foods that Americans would call *savory*, eg a rich bone broth]  IIRC, and all other taste sensations supposedly actually come from the nose and the sense of smell), varying directly with the quality and amount of cocaine (a very strong gasoline type ""taste"" [ie smell], probably partially due to solvents used in production, but i am pretty sure cocaine itself has that solvent taste to it).

Heroin, on the other hand,  had no taste as far as i was concerned.i do not remember ever noting a taste,  even a faint one,  while shooting tar or ECP in the early to mid-2000s.

Today, i definitely taste the ECP I get. I cant really describe the taste, and its not vinegary even when i have the good stuff that reeks of it, but it is a definite taste every time it's good, real dope (fent cut almost certainly in these stamps, but still good heroin with it).

Also, I'm on low dose subs, praise Allah, and I taste the taste, and it's always there even if it's partially blocked in the brain.

Have I changed or is it the dope? Maybe it the fent I'm tasting? Maybe I discounted the taste when I was young because it's relatively weak compared to coke even if I did taste it.

Has anyone else developed a more keen sense for the taste of a shot of dope?",1537029902.0

And the other two are part of some kind of behavioral resource center and im not sure how to schedule with them there are certain mental health type services in my town that you have to have a referral from the psych ward at the hospital and nl other way to get in. Theres a psychiatrist next town over that i hear gives stuff out pretty easy and hes a sub doc although idk anybody that gets subs from him just a old dude that gets a high dose of xanax from him. 4 mg a day. But i dont really have any experience with psychs i mean if i went that route can i call the office to confirm i guess he gives out subs or is that a bad idea i dont like asking docs for certain medications i dont want to seem like a drug seeker but i need subs to stop much worse. Also there is a methadone clinic a few minutes away but i want subs.

Lol","So you guys may remember me, and my story about trying to produce a sperm sample while high on oxy, and then my descion to get clean from everything after my sperm results came back really bad from all of my drug and alcohol abuse over the years. 

Since me and my girlfriend have been trying to have a child, the doctor basically told me I needed to get clean to be able to have a chance at getting her pregnant because my sperm count was horrible and I only had around 0.7% of active sperm when regular males are around 4%.  So I did. I got clean from everything and it's been about 2.5 months. I had a few relapses on alcohol but I have stayed away from cocaine, opiates and I even quit a 10year marijuana habit as well. 

I feel great, I am currently in school right now for my final year of electrical so I will be a master electrician in about 2 months. 

Me and my girl have been trying for a child for just about 2 years now, and nothing has worked but I also had not gotten of drugs and alcohol prior to two months ago and I was a decently heavy user of oxy, with occasional heroin, drinking 4-6 days of the week all the time  and snorting coke every weekend for years.

She missed her period this month and sure enough, the test came back positive.

Although this is still very early in the pregnancy and anything can happen over the next few months, I'm proud of myself for actually getting clean, and getting clean actually worked for us to conceive. This gives me even more motivation to STAY clean to raise this child and hopefully the pregnancy goes smoothly. Just wanted to update you guys on the situation if anyone cared. You all gave me lots of helpful advice and words of motivation and I still message with a few of you on here that have had my back when I wanted to relapse on heroin and I am truly grateful for that. I'm excited to be a father, and to be a sober father unlike my alcoholic father. I want to be the best dad I can be and I can only do that if I'm sober. 

Thanks guys, stay safe.

when I draw it up its hella foamy inside the rig and idk what to do about it.

so far I've been shooting the foam, is that bad?? Isnt it bad for air to be injected in your veins? 

this foam has to be the result of whatever cut my plug put in the dope, because this doesnt usually happen but it has happened before. does anyone know what cut causes it to foam up like this? is it bad for you?

There are many unopened prescription bottles in medicine cabinet behind the bathroom mirror. They all have his and other names on them. Lithium. Depakote. Prozac. Celexa.  I never know when one of his episodes is coming on.

Dale wears a clean white t-shirt and shuffles a worn pair of close toed slippers across his afghan rugs. They are propped up on the end of the couch now. His head rests at the other. He grunts and exhales dramatically. I sweep up the glass with the broom and pan and clean the spoon before placing it in the dishwasher. It‚Äôs better when I‚Äôm in my room. He never bothers me there.

Once I hear his door closes for the night, I sneak out to the front steps for a smoke. Party lights blink in the neighbor‚Äôs window. Something‚Äôs playing but is softer now and unrecognizable. She‚Äôs probably having sex with whoever I heard laughing through the door earlier. I was nothing special to her. That‚Äôs okay, though. Neither is she. Well, that‚Äôs what I tell myself. I roll the cherry out of my cigarette and flick it toward the street. A raindrop falls on my forehead as I walk back in. I think of Jerry and the fourth step, then Sal and the relapse before I fall asleep.

Dale is up when I come into the kitchen to cook breakfast.

He holds another wet towel to his face and mutters in the dark of the living room and tells me he‚Äôs going to the hospital. I nod. He shows me his face. The red lumped cheeks have wept an oily mucus overnight now dried in a green crust on his skin. His mouth is puckered and small from the swelling.

‚ÄúYeah. Maybe they can give you a cortisone shot or at least some oral steroids to help with the allergic reaction.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe.‚Äù Dale says through his teeth.

The door shuts behind him, and he gets into his white Ford Explorer through the front window. I pour a cup of coffee and open the fridge to pull out the can of Spam from the morning before covered in tin foil and a diet Dr. Pepper. This has been my morning routine for months. Black coffee and diet Dr. Pepper while I fry up some Spam.

When I was a kid, we never ate it. Probably because it smells like dog food before it‚Äôs cooked, but someone fried it up one time and shared it with me at the halfway house I lived in right after rehab. I never looked back.

Maybe, it‚Äôs not healthy to eat so much Spam. I think to myself. A half can every morning. For a moment images of my own ballooned feet retaining water flip through my head while the grease pops in the pan. Then, I begin to tell myself a story. I call it, The Attack of the Spam Babies. It‚Äôs about the pandemic of parasitic creatures which evolved from sodium molecules and preservatives in the canned meat product. They incubate themselves like tiny bugs at first just under the host‚Äôs skin. A person might confuse them with blisters or mosquito bites for a while, but as they grow, the bumps get as big as grapefruit. Inside, malignant fetuses kick and turn the way babies do, but when they come to term, they crawl out of the human‚Äôs mouth and devour them like the giant, hybrid larvae of a wasp or botfly made of Spam. Everyone is infected. The world is being taken over by these creatures. It plays like a low budget, horror/sci-fi flick from the sixties in my mind.

Then, I think about my diet Dr. Pepper and wonder if drinking so much aspartame is as bad for me as they say. I looked it up once. According to the FDA and all peer reviewed studies, aspartame has no negative side effects unless it is consumed in impossibly large quantities. Also, people who have an ailment called phenylketonuria can have problems with it, but belief in aspartame being so unhealthy is believing that the FDA and several other organizations have conspired to falsify the results of the tests, that they are hiding the proof of detrimental side effects for a profit. I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them.

I‚Äôm no stranger to conspiracy theories. Dale fed me several the first few weeks I lived with him. He might be considered a rightwing nut job. I don‚Äôt know, but whatever he is, some of it rubbed off on me. When I called my mom and the old man she‚Äôs married to, I would tell them about Pizza Gate or the Kardashian family belonging to the illuminati and how Bruce Jenner‚Äôs transition to Caitlyn Jenner tied into all of that. It wasn‚Äôt that I believed it as much as I was just sharing the information.

They never appreciated it. My mom had already dragged the old man into paying for my psychotherapy sessions between the ages of 11 and 13. I went because I had become extremely antisocial. Anytime I found myself in a public setting or talking to someone, my mind would automatically blast me with visceral imaginations of whoever was talking to me while they sat on the toilet, like I could smell the way their guts digested their dinner and see their bowel movements in all its different consistencies, black and greasy silt or crumbled chunks of brown clay or painful strings of a slimy yellow snot. I could hear the wet plops and their red-faced groans. It was crippling.

After two years of therapy and 20,000 dollars later, it went away. I just grew out of it. Therapy did nothing. I told my mom and the old man what it was all about after that. They didn‚Äôt seem impressed. Years later, when I got out of rehab and started telling them about conspiracy theories over the phone they asked me where I got those ideas. My mom asked me if I wanted to go back to therapy. They wondered if it was just something newly sober addicts went through. I haven‚Äôt seen them since they sent me to live with my dad in the city at 15.

Oh, well. I think, chewing my spam now. My shirt is off. There is a paisley shaped blister of bubbled skin on my stomach where grease popped out of the pan yesterday and burned me. I press it with my thumb. Clear liquid leaks out of it and rolls through the hair above my belly button.

‚ÄúSpam Baby.‚Äù I whisper.

Leaves pop with fall of heavy rain drops in the tree out front.

It‚Äôs not raining. Not really. It‚Äôs not even drizzling, but the day is gray, and there are a few rain drops falling from the sky. I just don‚Äôt consider it raining. Others might. Other‚Äôs probably do, but one thing‚Äôs for certain. I need a raincoat with me in case it does start pouring.

The only raincoat I own is hiding somewhere. I pick through the piles of clothes on one side of my room and fling them against the opposite wall. It‚Äôs a form of sifting, and while it makes the room even messier than it was before, it does allow me to find things. Five minutes pass. I‚Äôm sweating and breathing hard. Finally, the yellow sleeve of my raincoat shows itself. It is sticking out from under a large plastic bin full of books I‚Äôve read. The creased jacket slides out from underneath the weight of the book bin with a pull of the sleeve. I tie it around my waist as I walk out the front door. It‚Äôs raining oustide, now.

Our neighbor‚Äôs dryer vent blows hot scents of fabric softener into the driveway. Her husband‚Äôs truck leaks motor oil and diesel onto the wet concrete, and I walk through smells of pine bark mulch and fresh raindrops falling in the dirt where their yard had to be dug up for a busted pipe. There is no movement or sound on our block but my footsteps on the asphalt in the pale morning light. At the corner, a man with a black bandaged hand and head gestures and jabs the air declaiming like some diseased prophet.  His eye wanders. It rambles wildly as if it is an autonomous organism with its own distinct intentions and preoccupations, an insect which has bore a hole in the man‚Äôs face and made it its home. He yells at me as I pass.

‚ÄúYou have been called, boy! You have been called, but you have not answered! Your time is up. This day will be your death. Hell has place for you yet! Yes! It has place for you yet!‚Äù

Fear rolls through my biceps and the insides of my wrists. The fear is that this strange encounter might turn into a physical altercation. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt him. More than that, though, I don‚Äôt want to get hurt or infected with whatever he might have.

He‚Äôs crazy. I tell myself. Crazy or not, the words hit me hard. I know exactly what he‚Äôs talking about. It‚Äôs as if his crazy rambling is not crazy at all but actually the emission of some eternal and infinite intelligence warning me away from the path I‚Äôm taking. This is the first time I‚Äôve thought about Sal and the gift he‚Äôll be giving me shortly on the train, if he comes through and if I see him. The decision is death, and I know it. The decision is death, and it‚Äôs one I make willfully.

The train ride is cold.

The rain has moistened my shirt and pants enough that the cool insides of Sounder car are miserable. I stare at a mother and her son in the seat across from me. He is a grown man but can‚Äôt take care of himself. His face looks to have been smashed by the orifice that squeezed it out decades prior to today. The chin and head are small. Primitive eyebrow ridges call back to the rim of the cratered rock which held the fabled primordial soup, the accidental slop from which all life crawled forth. He spits a chunk of half chewed bread at the window. Strands of saliva stick from his mouth to the glass. He laughs, and his mother coos and clucks rubbing his shoulders like a momma bird soothing her babies in the nest. The scene has made me sick and angry this morning. I decide then that his life is the argument for eugenics and maybe, I‚Äôm not as opposed to it as I thought.

Someone slaps my shoulder. It‚Äôs Sal. He is shooing me over making sweeping gestures away from himself with the backs of his hands. I scoot over.

‚ÄúSah?‚Äù He says and swings into the seat. It‚Äôs funny to him to say it so absurdly.

‚ÄúSup, bro?‚Äù I don‚Äôt mean to, but I am rubbing my hands.

‚ÄúBro! Put your tongue back in your mouth! Haha! You‚Äôre looking like a fiend.‚Äù I don‚Äôt appreciate his comment, but he‚Äôs right. Besides that, he‚Äôs got the power over me this morning in a baggie in his pocket or wherever he‚Äôs holding it. ‚ÄúHow ya going to do it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù

‚ÄúBro. I haven‚Äôt thought that far. I‚Äôm just going to see it for now. I‚Äôll decide how when I get there.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what?‚Äù He laughs.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see it!‚Äù

‚ÄúSee what?‚Äù He laughs again.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, what?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù I turn away and look out the window. The sky is black. Everything is wet and getting wetter.

‚ÄúAight. Aight. Here you go, man. Don‚Äôt throw a fit, huh?‚Äù He reaches down and tugs on the cuff of his jeans. There‚Äôs a square fold of paper in his sock. Sal pulls it out. ‚ÄúYou know, I ain‚Äôt really one for lying, and I ain‚Äôt really one for giving out stuff for free. I was thinking all last night that I should just make you pay for it.‚Äù He holds it out. I reach for it, and he pulls it back from me. Sal hands it to me.

I unfold the piece of paper. Inside, there is a wax baggie. It is stamped with the letters D.O.A. in black ink. This is the kind of packaging I have seen pictures of and heard about from a couple I lived with in New Mexico in my twenties. They were from Atlantic City and told stories of the girl turning tricks for tourists she met on the boardwalk. They bought bundles, which were supposed to be ten bags, but they got 11 from their dealer. I always wanted to see what they were talking about and try it. Here it was right in front of me.

‚ÄúD.O.A?‚Äù I ask.

‚ÄúDead on arrival.‚Äù

‚ÄúLooks like there‚Äôs barely anything in there.‚Äù I am accustomed to dime and even nickel sized boogers of black goo stuck to square cut pieces of trash bag in a balloon.

‚ÄúYeah, man. That‚Äôs what I was asking how you‚Äôre gonna do it for. This stuff should be deadly. Better than anything you‚Äôve ever tried.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah. You said it‚Äôs of a brick a bunch of Vietnamese dudes had in an apartment. I mean. They probably don‚Äôt get their stuff from some dude of the corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. They don‚Äôt. They said they get it from an old man. I‚Äôm guessing some family or something from back east. I don‚Äôt really know, but they ain‚Äôt playing around. That‚Äôs for sure. Barely speak English, man.‚Äù

I nod. We sit in silence a moment.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm prolly gonna snort it. I don‚Äôt have a rig.‚Äù

He nods. ‚ÄúGet at me, if you want more.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúFacebook.‚Äù

‚ÄúFacebook? I don‚Äôt have one.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt have Facebook?‚Äù

A number of paranoid thoughts enter my mind. Government surveillance and information collection are thoughts for a second. My drug use. My criminal history. Things like that. ‚ÄúMe. I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

‚ÄúDude. A lot of reasons.‚Äù I raise my voice. The mother of the disabled son raises her scarfed head to look. Sal and I have been very quiet up to now. ‚ÄúI had it for a few months after I got sober. Made friends with all the people I went to high school with. They‚Äôre all doctors and lawyers and have children. I‚Äôm living in the back of some psychopath‚Äôs apartment paying way too much money with a crappy job and just got sober at 32. I got tired of reading about lonely old ladies‚Äô urinary tract infections and body image issues. You know? I knew them from N.A. and A.A. It was like, why are you posting about this? It looks pathetic. Just like when people post their sad dinner pictures. Are you really that sad and lonely? Are you really posting a picture of the salad you just made and the crusty tortilla you‚Äôre about to eat? Wow! I don‚Äôt care. A bunch of political propaganda and warnings of supposed pedophile rings using certain ads to lure their victims and all that crap. My mom‚Äôs sister-in-law and this crazy hippie chick I met at C.A. meeting once went off, bro, I mean they WENT OFF on each other on one of my posts, arguing about breastfeeding in public and whether that‚Äôs acceptable. Dude, my post had nothing to do with that. It‚Äôs just like it‚Äôs a place where people freak out on each other over nothing or make public announcements about how they‚Äôre freaking insane or sad and lonely.‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm.‚Äù  He turns his head to the side as if thinking. His bottom lip is pushed up.

‚ÄúAnd get this, yo. Get this! You know what the worst part was, Sal? Guess. Just guess. It was that I was doing all of these same things. Me, bro! I had to get rid of it.‚Äù I am screaming. Another passenger laughs at what I‚Äôm saying. Sal holds his hands out.

‚ÄúAight, bro. Aight. Calm down. Man. You‚Äôre tripping out on me. Making a scene.‚Äù He laughs a little. ‚ÄúBut, look, check it out. I need you to get a hold of me. Search for Sal Emmanuel Garcia. I‚Äôm the only on in this city on Facebook with that name. I‚Äôll come right up. Just make an account and get at me. Remember, I just gave that to you so you can tell me what‚Äôs up with it. I already know it‚Äôs fire, but you gotta keep your end, now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. Sal Emmanuel Garcia. Got it.‚Äù

He rides with me for another few stops. We bump knuckles, and he gets off. I look at the baggie once more before folding it back up in the paper and sliding it into the breast pocket of my raincoat. My clothes have dried some. The heater must be on in the car. It‚Äôs warmer. I get off in a few stops.

I valet park cars in a garage at one of the hotels downtown.

My boss is a large Samoan with a thyroid gland that is currently trying to kill him by leading his entire endocrine system and vital organs in full blown mutiny against him. He speaks like Eeyore and wears the same khaki pants and blue collared shirt as I do for my uniform. We talk about his divorce and how that‚Äôs going.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still living with me though. It‚Äôs awkward.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, yeah. Didn‚Äôt you say she‚Äôs sleeping with someone else?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs he sleeping with her at your house?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Dude, you should have more respect for yourself than that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love her, man.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay. But that‚Äôs not the same thing as having to disrespect yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to explain. She is struggling financially.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever.‚Äù

I turn away from him and lean onto the valet kiosk. The things he‚Äôs just told me disgust me. Everything about him is ridiculous. The way he talks. His depression. The way he lets his ex-wife use him. I have moved the baggie from the folded piece of paper into my pants pocket and finger it from time to time. A customer walks up. I write the ticket and take the keys. I park the car. I wait at our desk and do it again when the next one comes. Finally, it‚Äôs a quarter past four. If I walk back to the desk slowly, this old lady handing me her keys will be the last one for the day.

The inside smells like expensive perfume and new car. It is basically a Toyota Landcruiser, but Lexus‚Äôs 2016 version of it with leather interior and beautiful woodgrain panels. Everything is automatic. It has all the bells and whistles. The gold emblem in the steering wheel represents a world of things I don‚Äôt understand and never will. My mom does. The old man she‚Äôs with buys them for her.

I find a dark corner of level three in the garage. It is quiet. No one is around. I pop open the center console and find an owner‚Äôs manual in it. The wax baggie is flimsy in my fingers but stiffens enough when I press the sides to open its mouth. Fuzzy granules fall onto the glossy cover. I can barely see what‚Äôs there in the dark. An old Wal Mart gift card with an irrelevant amount of change left on it makes a poor line of the substance. It looks like a much smaller imitation of the smallest ship from the game Battleship or maybe a woodlouse. I roll a dollar bill up and snort it.

The powder burns, even though there‚Äôs almost nothing there. My eyes water. A nasty chemical taste hits the back of my tongue. I lean back onto the head rest and breath. My nasal cavity still stings. I can‚Äôt tell how long passes, but I am guessing that it is something like a couple of hours by the way my boss is frantically banging on the window.",1536955174.0

The dope quality had been going down for months and i was thinking of quitting due to the fact i couldn't find any real good heroin. Then one day i sniffed a 4 bags and within 20 minutes my heart was RACING. literally close to 300 bpm a minute. My entire body was shaking violently and my vision was blurred to fuck due to my eyeballs shaking too. i told myself if i didn't get better in an hour i would call 911. I was utterly terrified. It did go away in an hour and i was ok.

I have come to the conclusion it was heroin cut with clenbuterol mainly due to this article [http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html](http://today.uchc.edu/headlines/2005/aug05/heroin.html)

It scared me off dope for well over 2 year and now i cant use without worrying about this. Has anyone else come across this? also my buddy who smokes it did not notice these effects. It seems it has to be sniffed or shot. 

The heroin also tasted floral but also bad. kinda like rotten flowers

horrifying. 

any one else have the misfortune of getting this stuff?

How can you scream at me and tell me how stupid I am because its 8pm, dark and your pupils are just as small as they were 3 hours ago?

How can you think I am that stupid? When I know you better than anyone does...and you know that.

I want to thank you all for giving me insight and helping with my questions.

I ended up going cold turkey starting Monday morning this week.

I took clonidine .2mg and 6 loperamide 2mg 4x a day for the first 2 days, then clonidine 3x a day with 4 loperamide on Wednesday. 

On Thursday morning, I took one last clonidine and that was it. 

I slept a LOT.  I was exhausted (I think because of the clonidine), and the dry mouth from the medication was the absolute worst.

But today, I woke up with energy and a new outlook on my future.  I FEEL FUCKING GREAT!

I don't know if I am the norm, but I feel very fortunate that I didn't feel any of the withdrawals like I did years ago when I tried to quit.  I think on Wednesday night I had about an hour in the late night where my legs felt restless, but besides that I didn't cough, sneeze, no runny nose, no yawning, no aching, no headache.  Just tired, and again, I think that was the clonidine.

I am sure that the positive desire to be done with this is also a factor in how I feel.  I have NO DESIRE at all to go back to the way things were.  It was such a wonderful feeling to wake up this morning at 7AM and I was alert and ready to go.  I can't count how long it has been that I would wake up in the morning and drag myself out of bed, just to get out to the garage where I kept my stash of pills so I could get one in my system and feel I could then start the day.

I find that I unconciously still touch my pocket to check to make sure I have a pill there for my day.  I am guessing that that muscle memory will take some time to break, but it sure is great to know that I can take off my pants and not constantly worry that I may have left a pill in there for my wife to find, or, God forbid, a pill falls out of my pocket on the ground for others to see and question.

THE LIE IS OVER!  And I am really looking forward to the new me.

Thank you all again, I will probably still lurk here, and if I can be a strength and help to others, that would be the least I can do.

For those of you out there that are ready.  YOU CAN DO THIS!  Have the positive mental attitude and if you want, use my mantra:

*better every day*

God Bless you all.  And thank you again.",1536940112.0

I decided to hit in the crook of my arm- you know, the inside if the elbow. I don't hit there often, thus that is where my vein Old Faithful lies. I insert the needle, register and everything seems to be going fine. I'm in the vein, no issues yet.

When I pushed the plunger in it felt like I injected fire into my veins. It shot all the way up my forearm and into my hand. I quickly pulled the needle out and started rubbing my burning itchy arm. 

What happened next convinced me my arm was going to need to be lopped off. My forearm, wrist and hand swelled. My hand was the worse. It swelled 3-4times its original size. I couldn't make a fist and the skin was pulled so tight it felt like it was going to rip open. 

What happened? Any ideas? Has this ever happened to anyone else? After 2-3 days my hand went back to normal. I didn't seek medical advice because after a couple of hours the swelling started to go down. It looked almost like an allergic reaction.- like a giant hive.

I'm not allergic to the dope though bc I've shot it before in other veins without an adverse reaction. 

So, any ideas on what happened would be interesting to hear.

TL;DR Did shot, felt like my arm was on fire, hand swelled to giant proportions.

It‚Äôs creeping up on the 6 month mark since I quit a very heavy pharma habit. (90mg-300mg Oxy IR per day switched over to a 200mg-400mg per day Morphine habit due to availability and pricing). It feels great to not wake up sick.. and not think about pills every fucking waking moment... this is kind‚Äôve a shit post / update, but really I just wanted to check in and provide some reflections. 

The following are the 3 main reasons why I feel I hopped the opiate train at the perfect time: 

1.) I had switched from Oxy to Morphine due to price and availability of Oxy in my area. 2 months into my quit, my Morphine plug (a 60+ year old cancer patient) passed away. This guy had unlimited morphine at literal unbeaten prices, was always, always home. So that tragedy occurring, undoubtedly was a big factor in preventing my relapse. RIP Unc <3 

2.) The main plug for Oxy in my small town (has been main guy around here for 10 years and running) just got his house raided Sunday, and booked Monday for possessing 2 handguns (1 coming up stolen) with a felony, as well as several other charges. So he‚Äôll be gone for a good while. 

3.) When I was using heavy, I maybe encountered 30 fent presses maybe 2 times in my years of use. Now, everyone I talk to, it seems to be the ONLY blues that are flooding the streets. I‚Äôm not saying real blues aren‚Äôt obtainable, but I know (at least my area) the presses are more common than real deal blues 10 times to 1. FENTANYL EVERYWHERE. 

At this point, even if I wanted to relapse, I literally have no idea where I‚Äôd even look. Besides dark web, which I‚Äôm too old school for. Or cold copping shitty fenty dope in the inner city, which I‚Äôve never done dope, and never will. Watched 5 really good friends die, and many others in and out of jail/rehab. So just not my thing. I make great money and could always support my pharma habit. 

 So yeah, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm out, I‚Äôm glad I have released the demon. It‚Äôs nice looking through the window from the other side. I have a lot of love and respect for (mostly) everyone  and I wish everyone nothing but the utmost success in whatever goals are currently in their sights. Much love, opiate family.

I hesitate to call this hustle a success and if you read this wall of text you'll see why. When I need extra cash I look for odd jobs on Craigslist. My favorite are those that say pay is negotiable. It turns out I'm a stellar salesman and I can get good money for an easy job most of the time. Last week an ad for cleaning with a negotiable pay caught my eye and I met with an old women who needed a whole house cleaned. She said she'd pay me per hour for as long as it took.

Easy money right?

She told me her kid lived in the house and made a big mess. The price is negotiable because her kid was a ""drug user"" and she was positive there were drugs or needles inside. She wanted to be upfront about the safety risk so she was willing to pay more. My junkie brain was thinking what a score not only will I get paid hella cash for cleaning a house but I might find dope.

We agreed on $50 an hour and I started.

I'm not judging anyone for being messy especially when they're strung out. Who can be fucked to clean for free right? I understand, I really do. But fuck man, this was something else. Let me paint a vague picture for you. You guys know wd shits right? Well the toilets in this house had years worth of ass sludge crusted in and around them. I think the porcelain was starting to erode from the constant stream of acidic shits hitting the surface. The fridge was left cracked and the whole inside was molded: green mold, grey mold, foamy mold, I've seen it all. I think if it was left any longer mushrooms would start growing there. The cabinets were brimming with mouse shit, every corner of every room had cobwebs, I needed a face mask to dust. I thought cleaning a house would take me 4 hours but it took me 8. JJ didn't bless me with a stray bag either so by hour 6 I was starting to feel WDs myself. At one point I just finished cleaning the floor and then lost my lunch after smelling the fridge and had to start again. I felt like I was a contestant on a fucked up reality show:

""Junkies Cleaning up After Other Junkies"" idfk

At the end of the day I said sorry to the woman for taking longer than I first guessed but she didn't care. She thought I underestimated the mess to begin with. Then the woman starts crying. She tells me I'm an angel because she couldn't go into the house after her son died in it and didn't know what to do. I start crying too because it hit too close to home. She took that as an invitation to keep talking. My next two hours were spent listening to the woman that reminds me too much of my own mom crying her eyes out about her kid who od'ed.

and I was crying with her.

The successful part is that she paid me for the 8 hours cleaning and the 2 hours talking at $50 an hour. I made $500 for a days work which was a score but fuck me if I ever have to do that again. ",1536903553.0

at the moment I am some sort of chipper amd this time it really works. I ruined my piss test today but otherwise I know what I can tell my Psychologist why I took what I took. The next one is in about 1 or 2 month so I can consume now again.Yay. So atm I rail some lines ams then Inthrow in 20mg of Etizolam. IDK hoe strong it is compared to Diazepam for example. I cant find amything on google too. Its like google deleted everything about drugs. And bing dont work at my phone. IDK why. So maybe you can help me. Its for.relaxing and sleeping. I mean yeah I am really high but IDK if its just from the fire dope or from the fire dope.mixed with etiz. I started to enjoy benzos now. Since I cant use dope.daily anymore. Sadly and good cause otherwise I will be dead im some years and thats not what I want for.me or my family. I lost my dad 2. years ago and I know how hard that was. And I dont want that my mom and bro have to go through that shit again. So which benzos do you take? Also which do you mix with dope? I really like Alprazolam, Diazepam, Clonazepam, Etizolam, oh and I would love to test some rohypnol (flunitrazepam) but thats hard to find. I can get blistered benzos very cheap ans I know that not the right sub for this but r/Benzodiazepins is a joke... so maybe some of you could help me out. I am thankfull for every tip i dont care if its a tip for mixing dope and benzos or sedating benzos oh yeah I mostly enjoy the sedating benzos..Amd I dont take like 10 and black out the maximum are 2 or 3 over the day and max for one week and then I wait a few days so I wont get addicted to them they ahould just help me through my shitty job so I can go there the last few month untill I can get out of there and find a new one. Oh amd the etiz start kicking in now cause Instart nodding from about 100mg of dope nasal plus 20mg of Etiz. So yeah thanks im advance guys. And I will see a psychatrist in the next month who will hopefully give me a script for benzos too against my anxiety ans panic attacks. So thanks in advance fam. Stay safe and please dont write that mixing opis and benzos is risky. I always know that but I will do it. You cant change that. I cant change your habbits too. So love you fam. Stay safe and rememver to have narcan or call 911 for help. Every life matters. I lost 1 friend 2 weeks ago to an OD cause the assholes who were with him just threw him out of the house on the street and then called 911 and it was already to late. They were concerned cause they had paraphenelia. No drugs in the apartment. Such bastards. But karama will catch these assholes too. You can always do more not less so do a test bump/shot before you do your normal dose. I forgot that a week ago too and then I started nodding hard at work and my coworker came over to look for me and I stood up and collapsed and fell dowm and was out forinute or two she carred about me and I told her that it must be my meds and that I am ok. So since then everytime I got new stuff I do a teat bump and if I mix benzos and dope I just do half my dope dose because of the benzos. So enough from my high talking machine. Stay safe. And give me some tips for good benzos and please no RC benzos. Thanks im advance again fam. ",1536869759.0

I started on 4mg a day, then I realized once a day wasn't enough cause I was miserable by my best l next dose. So I took 4 then 2. Then 2 and 2. Then 4 in the morning. Then 3. Then 2. Yesterday at 3am I took my last bit (it was like 2.5-3.5. My friend was sick and had to fly so I cut her off some). My original taper plan involved one more strip, 2 in the morning then 1 in the morning, but the plug isn't picking up. Right now it's been almost 36 hours and I really don't feel that bad. Around 3 am today (bout 24 hours for those keeping track lol) I started to feel sick and I was bracing for a very tough, very long day, but right now I really don't feel too bad. The other day I left my subs at home and slept somewhere else, I woke up 24 hours after last dose and I felt pretty much how I do now, maybe it was a little worse then (this was already a massive improvement over the start of the detox. Day 1 I waited 26 hours and I was fucking dying). My question is if this is my tolerance getting lowered a lot, or just the subs taking longer to wear off? I didn't expect a taper to do much after less than 2 weeks, if this I lower tolerance I might just tell the plug to stick the sub up his ass for telling me ""I got you"" when I asked last night, then ghosting me all night and today.",1536866208.0

I‚Äôve been addicted to codeine kinda full-on for 2 years now. At one point I was on around 400-500mg doses (in one go, every night) but now I cap it to 300mg. Long story short, 2 months ago I developed GERD (basically like acid reflux but worse I think) and I take Zantac/ranitidine and things like ginger tea to help when it hurts after taking my dose.

Recently I‚Äôve been getting a horrible feeling of bloating and dizziness, but not every single time I take my dose. It got so bad the other night I thought I was going to pass out from the dizziness and I was certain I was going into anaphylactic shock because I didn‚Äôt take my normal promethazine pill to counteract the itching (instead certrizine this time).

Does anyone have experience with similar side-effects? I understand things like this might be localised to codeine and not other opiates/opioids. The GERD IS probably due to the fact I ALWAYS took it on an empty stomach to maximise effects until I started getting these symptoms. 

Thanks guys, stay safe :)

Earlier this year I came home from my grandmothers funeral, still in my suit to find my wife of 10 years deceased on the couch from an apparent overdose on Pain Medication.   


Addiction has ran in her family forever, through out entire marriage it has been an on-going battle for her to try to control. She has had multiple accidental overdoses through the years and we were lucky that I was always there to save her and get her help, however, this time I wasn't.   


We shared a 10 year old son together, this was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do, was to tell our son that his mother was gone forever. Addiction tears individuals apart and tears families apart, it is something that is very serious.   


I am actually a Film Maker, so after her death I decided to partner with a musician who wrote a song about addiction and create a powerful music video to help raise awareness for addiction. I would like to share that video with you here now and ask that if this video has an impact on you, rather big or small that you share it and hopefully it helps you or someone you know get help.

This question would be better in r/drugs or stims or benzos. But I'm on this sub every day, so I feel more comfortable asking here.

I took a tiny amount of coke tonight (rubbed a little on my gum & took a bump), not sure exactly what time I stopped but I know it was by 11pm (mtn time, not that that matters). For the first time since I started taking stims & benzos like 5 years ago, I forgot I'd just taken stims & took 1/4 of a 1 mg xanax around 12:45 am. Took another 1/4 about 30 seconds before I remembered I took stims that night.

I started purging right away & it looks like I got that second 1/4 out. But I'm not positive, & since I haven't ever made this mistake before I'm a little scared & not sure what to do. For reference I take about 2 mg xanax nightly (I know it's a bad idea to take these every day ftr. I'm slowly working on tapering). I'm 26 & dont think I have any serious heart conditions.

How much danger am I in guys? It wasn't a ton of either drug, so I can't tell whether I should keep purging until my stomach's empty or just ride this out or what..I know this is either a ridiculously dumb post or I made a very stupid mistake, but it is what it is.

Some of the things they tell you to do is to not use any synthetic opiates. I thought this was weird because they do not mention Natural Opiates.

Less toxic than say.. Hydrocodone?

Many opiates are naturally occuring in Opium, but they're all ""bound together"" in one plant. so its still in its natural state when consumed.

Ok so IF I understand all this correctly which is a big if, normal opiate agonists bind to the mu receptor agonize it and then detach and float around in your body and then reattach to another one with varying affinity(strength of attachment).

&#x200B;

<Please note I'm using terms sloppily and paraphrasing, feel free to correct me this is interesting!>

&#x200B;

These two drugs above however will attach to your mu receptors PERMANENTLY, they are never detaching. Sounds awesome right? Well not really since apparently mu receptors can only take so much agonizing until they internalize(get sucked back in and go into hibernation) taking them out of commission.

&#x200B;

So if what I am reading is correct these drugs should provide a powerful high for around 48 hours(narcan wouldn't work BTW!) at which point the mu receptors they are bound to would internalize, possibly leaving you with a near naive low tolerance? Maybe? I'm not sure if human beings, or addicts have ever consumed these, or if its all tests on guinea pig intestinal cells.

I‚Äôve come to realize other addicts almost always have at least a few good stories haha. 

I‚Äôll start it off with 2-

Me and a friend were both broke so we found some wire to scrap. Took it to the scrapyard and ended up being like $13 short for what we needed so decided to go to Walmart and steal a few of those big heavy gauge extension cords. We get to Walmart, grab a cart and go to the aisle. We weren‚Äôt sure exactly how many we needed and didn‚Äôt want to end up coming up short again so we figure better to be safe than sorry.  So we choose the longest heavy duty extension cords they had, they were like 100ft and costed $50/$60 each. 
We grab 8 of them, throw them in the cart and come to the conclusion that rather than just push the cart straight out like we already paid, it‚Äôd be less sketchy if we put our coats on top of them, he gets in the cart, and I push him out of the store. Well let‚Äôs just say our coats didn‚Äôt hide them at all and looking back at the situation, that was probably the MOST sketchy way possible haha. 
So anyway, we start heading towards the exit, no greeter/receipt checker so we think we‚Äôre good. We get through the first set of doors, about to walk through the second set when I‚Äôm pretty sure I hear ‚ÄúWalmart loss prevention‚Äù behind me in the quietest voice. I turn around and see this guy who I recognize from the aisle we got the cords from. He was there twice talking on his cell phone but not really looking at anything specific. Once I see him I already know I heard correctly and just keep walking. He says ‚ÄúExcuse me, Walmart loss prevention, please stop‚Äù and I of course ignore him. I had parked by the auto section where they do oil changes, so when we got outside I turned and start going down the sidewalk right in front of the store. Loss prevention is still following us but he‚Äôs staying back a bit for some reason.. I say ‚Äúyou ready?‚Äù to my friend (who‚Äôs still in the cart), he just gives me a look which I assumed meant he WAS in fact ready, so I stop short, putting the front of the cart against the garden section fence so it didn‚Äôt move as much when he jumped out and I start running, thinking he‚Äôs right behind me. Well he wasn‚Äôt, I get to the car and hear ‚Äúwait, wait, don‚Äôt leave‚Äù and see him still halfway between me and the cart. I start the car, open his door, and put the car in drive ready to takeoff once he gets in. We get away safely, no extension cords but at least we didn‚Äôt get arrested. LP stopped following us once we left the cart, I assume their main concern was getting their product back. We figured out another way to get money and after we copped and got high I asked him why it took so long to get to the car.. he says ‚ÄúI had to get our coats‚Äù Lmao like bruh, we have loss prevention following us and your first thought after hopping out the cart was to get our coats? Too funny.

This one is quick, just though it was kinda funny-
One time I met my dealer in a Home Depot parking lot. I was sick af and sat there for over an hour waiting. He finally shows up, I get my shit, and go into Home Depot straight to the bathroom. There‚Äôs 3 stalls, 2 of which also had someone in them so I decide to wait to get my shot ready. I‚Äôm sitting there impatiently for a few minutes when I hear an unmistakable sound, the flicking/opening of stamp bags. I say ‚Äúit sounds like we all had the same idea‚Äù and hear the other 2 people start laughing. I know they‚Äôre doing the same thing so I get my shot ready, do it and get out if there.

I've got a Norco scrip for pain which I take as needed. The thing is, sometimes when I'm having a bad day like today (had a medical procedure which did not go well), I feel high and gross before the pain is gone. So I'm sitting here in less pain but not none but not wanting to take more pills.
Is there anything I can do? Like, eat a big meal or something? I usually take on an empty stomach so I don't barf.
Obvi will talk to Dr but just curious if this lovely community had ideas. Also, just wanted to say that I've been subbed here for a while and this is clearly a supportive and kind community. You've created a really great place. ",1536803213.0

EDIT: I've added a TL;DR at the end of the post.

I've been clean of heroin and cocaine for approx two years. I was on methadone initially but really despise the stuff so changed to buprenorthine (we call it subutex of subbies) sometime in 2016..

So i was really keen to detox off the subbies before i start university in (oh my bloody fucking helllll) 5 bloody days. 5 days!! I'm kinda realising as i tyope how bloody soon that is! So i detoxed mid August and have been truly clean for 30 days (I say 'truly' clean as I'm aware that some people consider being on subutex or methadone as not true abstinence; interesting idea to debate as I'm on Quetiapine and Mirtazipine \[sp?\] probably forever. I'd be curious to know who would consider that to negate my abstinence).

Okay, so Iwent to a festival with a mate who likes to drink. I was undecided about about whether or not I'd drink - I was never an alcoholic really, but sadly, I can't be a casual drinker - I can't stop after a few and usually I just end up making a tit of myself. Or worse, I'll start fiending and will do absolutely anything to score (heroin, crack, ketamine or diazepam). My friend was drinking whisky, which is my choice of drink and probably the 'safest' drink for me - as I have in the past been able to have a hot toddy at a family xmas do, or a glass of Glenmorangie with ice and then just call it a day.

I realised that I'm really waffling. To cut a long story short, I scored crack and smack. This was Wednesday afternoon. I had a few pipes and sniffed a little of the gear. Thne I thought, if im going to do this, I'm going to do this properly (I don;t want any excuse tomorrow to score again). Took a taxi to a local pharmacy and bought some pins - online it said that there's a needle exchange in the pharmacy, turns out no, but I was able to buy a couple of pins (20p a pop! Who'da thought it?!)

So I've sorted myself a speedball and I'd really appreciate it if someone would run through some basic harm reduction with me.

To be really clear, i've not used heroin or crack cocaine (or anything) since April 2016. I'm not sober currently, I've smoked a little gear and a few pipes but obviously my tolerance is super low. I have a bunch of buprenorphine left over, is it at all possible that to use that in case of an overdose? I've heard it has naltrexone in it?Of course that would be a total last resort and probably sounds really stupid, but I'd rather deal with instant withdrawal than to OD..

EDIT: Is it possible to purchase naltrexone from a chemist? Headshop?

EDIT: TL;DR:  
I've relapsed but don't want to die tonight. Seeking any harm reduction knowledge or info regarding naloxone in the UK.

EDIT: I've heard of a few overdoses occurring in the UK due to another more potent opiate being in the gear. I can't remember the name of the stuff but there was a Louis Theroux documentary about it in the US somewhere. There's also been a few mentions of it on BBC Radio 4 and I've seen several posters warning of the increased likelihood of overdosing if your skag is laced with this stuff. I'm based in North West England, should I be concerned about this stuff? Also, as I've been clean 2+ years so I don't have a regular guy who I can trust not to give me dodgy gear...",1536801073.0

It's been a minute since I've been on here. Had a little run of clean time, then shit hit the fan IRL and... ""Fuck it"" mode - ENGAGED.

&#x200B;

That out of the way, My connect is a woman that gets fat scripts every month. For years the process goes as follows -

\-1: She gets her script

\-2: I middle for her on a single big deal that moves 2/3 of her product and nets her about $500 and nets me about $300 which I use to pay the power bill.

\-3: As the weeks progress, I get the odd front here and there and I end up owing her about 60-90 bucks when the scripts  run out.

\-4: The following month, she re-ups, we do the single 2/3 deal as per usual and I pay her what I owe her out of my $300.

&#x200B;

This has been the routine since time out of mind. Well this time, she sold her main nut to someone else (historically I've been her only buyer because I'm safe, simple and have only a couple of clients I sell to) and then lied about it saying that the pharmacy was out and had to order the script leaving me calling her \*every\* day asking about whether it's come in yet. Also, me telling MY clients that I'm waiting on the pharmacy when in fact, she had it the whole goddamn time.

&#x200B;

Instead of making this a ludicrously long post the TL;DR is: 

My long term dealer decides to fuck me and sell the bulk of their shit to a shady as fuck third party fucking me out of my cut of the cash, leaving me floundering  and scrambling trying to pay my fucking power bill and then strung me along with a lie.

Obviously certain drugs like benzos or other sedatives that are scheduled narcotics work. However I have been looking for something more accessible and not illegal or requiring a dealer or prescription. I know I could use alcohol but this just makes the methadone feel dirty. 

So far I have tried a variety of otc drugs and supplements with varying results. 
Baking soda an hour before felt like it increased the amount of methadone that was metabolized though not that great. Cats claw seemed to do the same thing at about the same level. Prilosec did this to but was actually noticeably quite effective and I was left with pinned pupils and slight euohoria that I do not usually get from my daily usual dose. Still this experience was lacking for some reason and did not feel adequate enough however. I tried white grapefruit juice and this did seem to heighten the effects slightly as well. Also tried chamomile and this literally knocked me out on the floor and according to my house mates it looked as if I had a minor seizure so never again ( I was coming off benzos around this time though I was doing a careful tamper but this might explain what happened). As for things like soma, tagamet and promethazine I cannot get these in Canada or require a prescription unfortunately. 
This is where I almost gave up. 
I kept reading and a medication  called ophenadrine kept coming up as a drug that is a muscle relaxer and antihistamine that can cause euphoria and according to anecdotal results and studies people reported that when taken with an opiate it increased analgesic effects and ""helped the opiate find the pain better"". 

This is where I got interested and went to a pharmacy I dont usually go to and they had some for a relatively cheap price. I took 200mg and then went to dose my methadone at my clinic ( 75mg). For the 30 minutes that I walked before I got to my clinic I noticeably could tell the spasms I usually get in my calf had subsided and so had my sciatica pain that had been bothering me for days. Oddly I also felt in a much better mood then usual and felt that slight euphoria that people reported about it. 

One hour after dosing my methadone I could feel it coming on alot stronger then usual and noticeably a dull headache I usually get had subsided and methadone alone usually doesn't help this. I had a bong bowl and from here things got really interesting. Heavy sedation and a heavy nod that marijuana does not cause usually happened as I dont feel an interaction between cannabis and methadone ever. The classic opiated feel and almost weightlessness kicked in with feelings of relief and relaxation and clarity that I only seem to feel when I take short acting opiates. 

I Would not recommend potentiating methadone as this is dangerous and obviously the point of maintenance is maintenance and not to get high mixing things that mess with your CNS and can cause heavy respiratory depression ending in death. The reason that I do this is that I have major chronic pain issues and I feel that methadone can actually cover this if I find ways to make it work better and based on doctors and patients notes about orphenadrine increasing analgesia and helping the painkillers I had to try and these people were not kidding. I imagine for increased effects I could do something like take prilosec and ophenadrine but I dont want to add too many things together and obviously create interactions that are dangerous and that cause too much pronounced respiratory depression.",1536776610.0

I probably only needed 1mg, as yesterday, 0.50mg, had worked quite well, but did not alleviate my pain (as stated in previous post)


I've been using Bupe for 10 years. Im just trying to figure out how to make it work better cuz ive been in very severe chronic pain.


And im not syaing this goes for everyone, but when im relaxed, i really do feel the bupe more, in a euphoric sense, the sense of good well being . i know its not easy for people to achieve this state but idk

thats how i feel

chillin = awesome


being uppidy and doing shit = you aint thinking about it till you realized you mighta taken a bit too much that you maybe didnt even need.

so if you get what im saying, you can make more out of less


i break my 2mg'ers into 4 to 8 pieces, and take small amounts. also, if it goes past A particular time in which i feel like it won't be effective bcause i will be thinking too much or being too active i will hold off. holding off is OK !

There were lines of them downtown. Mostly Mexicans who resold the stuff we brought them at a flea market on the weekends. Sometimes we sold to an older Asian man who lurked the area.

They paid five bucks for two twelve-dollar cans of Crew pomade.   Pomade was easy to steal. They paid five bucks for two big cans of instant coffee. A tube of good toothpaste might fetch a dollar, and other smaller items like lip stick or shampoo might get us another buck, so we stole lots. Rufus had a large gym bag he‚Äôd bring. I had a bookbag and carried two fabric shopping bags, the reusable kind you get at the front of the store for a couple bucks.

I wondered if that was a coincidence or not, because when I took it, stealing from the stores seemed as inconsequential as dying in a video game. Kleptomania. Klonopin. I don‚Äôt know. Someone told me that kleptomania was a legitimate side effect of benzos. It was definitely true that they caused people to steal, but I‚Äôd heard that people could get off shoplifting charges if they were prescribed. Sounded cool but also like a lie.

Stealing our subway rides was always a challenge. But it was also like a game. Some transit official might see us coming and batten down the hatches to prevent us from coming, but while they did that, we would go back up to the street level and come in from across the street, jumping over the turnstile or sliding under it. Sometimes, we took the handicapped elevator. There was always a way.

Whenever we got to the strip mall with the stores we were hitting for the day, we‚Äôd hide one set of bags somewhere. Inside, Rufus or I would cause a distraction. The other would run through the choice aisles and fill his bags with the goods. Sometimes, we split up to save time and hit stores in a more modest fashion to avoid trouble. Once, I came back to a Safeway to find Rufus being reprimanded by a cop as management suspected him of stealing but when they called the cops, they couldn‚Äôt prove it. He laughed when they let him go and watched the cop drive off. Rufus had already been out of the store and stashed the loot in a port-a-potty. At a Walgreen‚Äôs once, a young Asian boy who obviously worked at the store was sent to follow me around awkwardly reading through a packet of coupons. I confronted him, but he just stood behind me fake reading through the deals Walgreen‚Äôs was offering that week. He made it harder to lift all that I wanted. I only got out with a few cans of Crew that night.

When we got back to the city, we sold our stuff downtown and walked up Pill Hill to get our Dilaudid or morphine. Sometimes, we called Victor and rode the bus to meet him on the other side of town. Sometimes, we went to eat at a soup kitchen where they were giving out free meals, but I always struggled to eat next to the flailing and mentally insane masses in the cafeterias. I always felt like there was feces floating in the air or being flung into my food by the people eating next to me. One night, this kid was walking around the spot where we slept and approached us. He looked like was maybe 19 or 20.

‚ÄúHi.‚Äù He said.

Rufus and I looked at each other. The kid was way too well dressed to be talking to us. I mean, he was wearing what looked like an expensive pair of tasseled penny loafers with no socks. A sharp pastel pink collar stuck out of a clean Izod sweater. Rufus and I were sitting on a bench pooling tobacco from half smoked cigarettes, so we could reroll it.

‚ÄúDo you guys know where to get any heroin?‚Äù He spoke with a British accent.

Rufus and I looked at each other again, suspiciously this time. A pair of bicycle cops rode by. One made eye contact with me. Was this young procurer one of them? Could he be trusted. Rufus spoke up first.

‚ÄúHey, youngster. Why don‚Äôt you make the block real quick. Let me and my associate here have a little talk. Come right back. See what we can work out.‚Äù

He walked away. Rufus turned to me.

‚ÄúWhat do ya think?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got an accent. Probably legit.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. What do we have left?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know maybe a twenty piece. He looks rich.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure does.‚Äù

When the kid came back we told him we‚Äôd be happy to part with what we had but wanted 50 for it. It was a scandalous thing to do. 50 was too much. But this wasn‚Äôt the time to start pretending that we had morals. Opportunity revealed itself. We would seize it. Everything else was an afterthought and really didn‚Äôt matter.

‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúWe only have to go to my parent‚Äôs flat.‚Äù

‚ÄúFlat?‚Äù Rufus asked.

‚ÄúHe means apartment.‚Äù I spoke up and turned towards the kid asking. ‚ÄúSay. What‚Äôs your name anyway?‚Äù

‚ÄúEdmund.‚Äù

‚ÄúK. Edmund. Let‚Äôs get to your flat, sir.‚Äù Rufus said in a fake British accent.

We walked for what seemed like an hour, and by the time we got there, Rufus and I were sweaty. The regular stale stench of our clothes used the humidity and heat from our bodies to push an even more pungent aroma of body odor and street into the halls of the apartment building. In the elevator, Edmund turned to us and said,

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll just say you‚Äôre my chums from secondary or university.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked horrified.

‚ÄúSounds sweet to me.‚Äù Rufus said.

‚ÄúListen,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea for us to be telling your parents we‚Äôre your friends from secondary or university. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, Edmund, Rufus and I are street people. I don‚Äôt think your parents would buy it. Can‚Äôt you just go in and come back out real quick with the money?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could, but it will work better if we tell them a story.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of story?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be more likely if they see you. We‚Äôll say you are my mates from school. I‚Äôll say you need money for a cab ride home.‚Äù

I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me. My parents are easy.‚Äù

I shook my head again and looked at Rufus. He smiled. His expression seemed indifferent about the idea of going into this kid‚Äôs parent‚Äôs apartment and telling them an obvious lie so he could get money for us. We walked on nice carpet and by nice tables with vases of flowers on them and looked into the clean mirrors hanging on the wall that Rufus and I never saw in the buildings we visited. There were plugin air fresheners pushing out the warm scents of cinnamon and pumpkin into the hallway. He and I were used to the smell of stale urine and mildew and meth smoke escaping through the cracks under the doors. The hallways of the welfare hotels we knew so well had holes in the walls and unintelligible words scrawled or scratched into the plaster, and the carpet was always ragged and stained. We were very clearly somewhere we didn‚Äôt belong.

Edmund opened the door and greeted his mother from there with a shout. His father walked into our field of view from the hallway. He held his head sideways and wore glasses peering over his son‚Äôs shoulder to see Rufus and me standing behind him. Edmund turned to us.

‚ÄúCome in.‚Äù

‚ÄúEdmund,‚Äù his father spoke, ‚ÄúWho do you have with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome chums from university, Father.‚Äù He said it *fah-tha.* It was something like a caricature of a spoiled English boy. Then again, it wasn‚Äôt really a caricature. He was a spoiled English boy.

‚ÄúTell them to sit down. We‚Äôre about to have dinner.‚Äù A woman‚Äôs voice called from the kitchen, his mother.

We sat down. The parents eyed us. They looked doubtful that we could be his classmates from college. There was a pot of soup and a pan of fried fish next to some plates of vegetables and potatoes. A bottle of wine. Sitting there, it occurred to me that we didn‚Äôt know what college this kid went to in the first place. If they asked any questions about that, we were screwed. We‚Äôd be outed, if they didn‚Äôt recognize that we were impostors already. They should have. It was obvious, but Rufus began to do his thing.

They were enamored. He was calling them by their names, which were Lucy and Harry Brown, like he was their old friend. Another bottle of wine came out. Lucy shouted and laughed at Rufus‚Äôs jokes. Harry made his own. Rufus spoke in his fake British accent and had started calling Harry by Harold. At one point, Rufus stood up and took Lucy by the hand for a small waltz around the table. Edmund and I traded looks. Harold clapped and cheered them on, his face red with laughter. They popped another cork on another bottle.

Eventually, the joking and laughing and shouting moved to softer more intimate talking. Lucy swayed from the wine. Harry‚Äôs smile bubbled up from inside of himself so that he couldn‚Äôt stop. He looked to be speechless. Rufus talked about his crazy life, and Lucy asked him how he met Boom Boom. She nodded to me with her head when she asked.

‚ÄúBoom Boom? He is my dearest and sweetest friend in this whole miserable life, Lucy. He is.‚Äù She swooned. ‚ÄúI was a scoundrel, Lucy. I was a scoundrel and he was good to me.‚Äù Rufus made eye contact with me and held it as he said it. I recalled the night I found him talking on the shoe like a phone.

‚ÄúTell me. Where does one get a name like Boom Boom?‚Äù She asked.

I stared. Rufus took the opportunity to answer.

‚ÄúYou want to know? Sit back, sweet Lucy. I‚Äôll tell you the tale. Harold, I see you‚Äôre with us still. Please, listen. Don‚Äôt let the wine take you from us yet. This is one I call the Strange Case of the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It‚Äôs quite the tale, and our beloved Boom Boom is the star.‚Äù He spoke in somber tones and held his hand out towards me, palm up, like an announcer introducing the main attraction in a circus freak show.

Rufus could really tell a story. I like to think that I take my inspiration from him. There‚Äôs no way though. He was such a natural, and that night, we were all blessed to sit at that dinner table and listen to what a master at his craft. He cleared his throat.

‚ÄúI am now and was then a scoundrel. As I‚Äôve told you, Boom Boom was very good to me. He treated me with kindness and compassion most never do. We spent every second together after that. These are things you already know, but he went by a different name at the time. One we won‚Äôt discuss, as it was one I never liked. No. No. I knew right away that I would have to change his name to one he deserved. The opportunity only had to show itself. And it did a week after we met.

‚ÄúThere was a strange man who showed up one day at our park out of nowhere. The man had obviously been in prison for most of his adult life. He wore a denim button up long sleeve shirt tucked into his jeans. His face was all tattooed up and he walked around showing the back of his palms and his thumbs sticking in. It was the prison walk and posture. You know what I‚Äôm talking about, right, Lucy?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt. Harry was drooling on the table. ‚ÄúWell, he had gotten a reputation around the block for grabbing at one of the girls we knew back then. Her name was Buffy. The guy also robbed several dealers at the park. These were guys we knew, so pretty quickly, he got the nickname the D\*\*\*\*\* Park Hammer. It was a strange case, as I‚Äôve said.

‚ÄúEnter, Boom Boom. Me and Boom Boom went to the park to sell a bag to a customer. When we got there, the Hammer was already up our buyer‚Äôs butt. The transaction was made. We walked away but heard our customer screaming for help before we got to the street. The Hammer was roughing the guy up on the basketball court, and out of nowhere, Boom Boom was on him. I‚Äôd tell you, Lucy, about how long the fight lasted, but I can‚Äôt rightly call it a fight. It was a knocking out. Boom Boom caught him with one left hook, and just like that, the man who had terrorized the local homeless and addicted population of the area for those few weeks was down for the count. Before we ran, I saw some kind of bloody ooze leaking from the man‚Äôs head onto the pavement. Later, I found out from Buffy, our female acquaintance who saw the whole thing, that the man was taken away in an ambulance, but not before the police handcuffed him to the gurney. He‚Äôd violated his parole and went back. We never saw him again. But that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the story of how Boom Boom became Boom Boom! The first Boom is the sound of his fist against the face. The next Boom is the sound of his opponent's head hitting the ground.‚Äù

Rufus looked up and smiled at me with a gleam in his eye. I smiled back. Lucy clapped her hands and laughed.

‚ÄúWOW! What a story, Rufus!‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúNow, what are the plans for you two?‚Äù

‚ÄúOur plans?‚Äù Rufus asked.

‚ÄúYes. What does the future hold for the two of you?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶. I‚Äôve had dreams of starting my own construction business. Not sure what to call it yet, but our motto will be‚Ä¶.‚Äù Rufus held his hands out and up in front of him as if framing a distant billboard with them, ‚ÄúOur motto will be, That Should Be Good Enough.‚Äù

Lucy clapped again and laughed. ‚ÄúHahaha! That‚Äôs perfect. I love it, Rufus. Gentlemen, it‚Äôs been an amazing night. I have to get Harold here to sleep.‚Äù

Rufus and I opened our eyes wide and lift our eyebrows at the kid. Edmund needed to get that money from them before they slept. This was his chance.

‚ÄúEh.. Mother?‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúYes, Edmond?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe chaps are in need of fare for a taxi home. I promised them we would help.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh. Of course! Of course! Let me see what I have.‚Äù She found a one-hundred-dollar bill in her purse and held it up for us to see. ‚ÄúAll I have is a hundred. Will this work?‚Äù

It would work. We thanked her and said our good byes. She carried her husband to the back bedroom, and Rufus and I walked out the front door with the kid. It was obvious that he would want change or something more for the money.

‚ÄúWell?‚Äù Edmund said.

‚ÄúWell, we can take you with us to the store for change or you can walk with us to get something more. It‚Äôs late and street dealers don‚Äôt work in the city at night. It‚Äôll be an adventure. Are you down?‚Äù Rufus said.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù The kid affirmed. We got in the elevator and hit the button for ground. It might be daylight before we could find anything. We‚Äôd let him realize that when it was already too late and he was too invested to back out. No need to spoil the fun before it started.",1536725250.0

What i came away with is that the feelings that Buprenorphine give you override the feeling of pain rather than actually killing it

130mg of DHC was less than 0.50mg of Buprenorphine

Upsides:
12 hour DHC definitely covers you for over 20 hours, you won't feel any withdrawal until the next day, or a few days later.
-----------------------------------------
Buprenorphine gets me high as fuck.



Downsides:
Instant Release DHC will have you wanting more medicine by night-time if taken in the morning


-------------
Buprenorphine doesn't really kill internal pain that well, or my pain is greater than the bupe.

Overall

130mg of dihydrocodeine was found to be a little b it less substantial than 0.50mg of buprenorphine but had a greater painkilling effect than buprenorphine.


The first day i had started with a geater doseage of DHC, 120mg ER and around 30mg IR .

DHC honestly doesnt have as much feeling to it as codeine. but it wasn't unpleasant


Im unsure whether to continue will 0.25 to 0.50mg buprenorphine or continue with 130mg dihydrocodeine.

and like i said, i found the 0.50mg bupe to be far stronger in terms of the actual euphoric effects but nnot in physical effects to actually kill pain. which it should be.

dihydrocodeine alleviated it during one of the worst possible moments


i was also able to use both low dose DHC and Buprenorphine in the same day.

i had learned that you CAN use Bupe and a short-acting opioid in the same day after being indoctrinated in several clinics by high-ranking doctors. so this is not my first time doing this but i also do not recommend it , theres a chance i have bupe built up in my body even if its a small amount to void pwd .but also on doctors note stating that i could take buprenorphine in the same day as taking codeine/dhc/hydrocodone/oxy (NOT oxycontin or longtec or ER)

So anything that is 6-8 hrs and <40mg of hydrocone or so, you should not incur any PWD when inducting into Buprenorphine . 

my assumption is that buprenorphine is so strong that it actually pushes the DHC/Hydrocodone/(short acting opioids) off of the receptors rather than actually fighting them for it and incurring the precipitated withdrawal.



This is basically a shitpost because ill be following up with my doctors . But advice is still appreciative:

1) im not trying to quit opioids, i have no need to quit opioids.
2) i am not looking for opioids, but suggestions on how to kill pain. (no kratom, no NSAIDs {unless its something i have not heard of}, muscle relaxers {pretty much allergic}, no tramadol {makes me loopy}
3) have any of you ever had trigger point injections work for your pain, and actually stay & work? (effect stayed over time?)
i guess lidocaine or botox would be used


Final Thoughts: DHC ER is great if you wanted to quit a long-term Buprenorphine useage while reducing your doseage further than you could reduce it with buprenorphine. It doesnt really get you high. IN the UK / EU they also use it to detox people. It lasts 6 hours instead of 3, and in ER form it lasts 12. ",1536711203.0

Even if I can get sober, my body has endured too much damage. Even if it's anxiety and not organ damage, there has simply been too much stress to my body for an entire life time. IT'S OVER. I lost. I will not reproduce, as I've fucked my body so much I wouldn't risk putting a child in this world if I'm gonna drop dead by age 40 due to taking INSANE doses of stimulants, Benzos, opiates, psychedelics, etc EVERYTHING. 

If I'm not going to reproduce do to fucking my body up permanently with drugs, then I'd have to find some type of purpose in life, otherwise it's pointless. 

I can't believe I've done so many drugs I am a complete and utter failure and I deserve death

I had $6.49 in my bank account and my Netflix payment would be hitting my account at midnight, so I had to get some money to my bank.  Otherwise, I'd get a $35 overdraft charge and Netflix would be shutoff. 

 Church Girl and I had a good time on Sunday (no we didn't fuck you pervs) and I even sprung for breakfast, so maybe she would help. I called her and asked for a ride to the bank and she said yes. When we got to the bank, I had to borrow $10 and she bitched at me ""where is all your money going"", but she coughed up the cash.

Now here is where it gets crazy. Church Girl is getting $10 from her bag and a bottle of pills fell out. I picked it up and read ADDERALL. OMG Church Girl is a speed freak. WTF?

I played dumb and asked her about her medication. She said that  ""the doctor gave her these pills and they helped her at work to be focused and more productive"". I almost cracked-up, but I wanted to see now stupid and naive and ignorant she was, so I didn't say ""damn girl, you're a speed addict"".

I told her that I wanted to be focused and more productive too and could I have some pills. She said that I had to ask my doctor, but she gave me ONE 20mg Adderall. I took that one pill this morning on an empty stomach and washed it down with strong coffee.

Now I have no tolerance to speed, so I was ZOOMING all day at work and people were starting to notice!

[https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2012/104975/)

In the study - the regent of liquid codeine solution was microwaved with a 450w microwave at 20C for 5 minutes with activated charcol as a regent. Apprantly the microwave radiation hydrodinizes the codeine into dihydrocodeine with stunning yields, which can be further converted to HYDROCODONE

Would this experiment work in low yields at home conditions? I haven't studied chemistry to any  huge degree, was just a part of my biology bachelors, so i'm not really knowledgable about the terms and conditions used in this experiment.

&#x200B;

Regardless - i have a 450w microwave, and i'm gonna try microwaving the liquid solution for 6 minutes at 20C to see the results (since i have bigger ammounts of codeine solution)

EDIT: probably not gonna work, ""2.5‚Äâg codeine was suspended in water (30‚ÄâmL) and acetic acid was added until codeine dissolved (1‚ÄâmL). pH of codeine solution was recorded at 4.75. 0.20‚Äâg Pt on activated charcoal catalyst (1% Pt/C) was added to solution. This solution was put into a CEM discover microwave reactor (CEM Corporation, Matthews, NC).

9ewuza,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuza/im_in_icu/,16,https://redd.it/9ewuza,dori_88,I'm in ICU,"Early Monday morning around 2am I got up to go get a glass of water downstairs, because i had a night terror and was really in pain. Even I  was convinced it was just anxiety. 

When reaching for a glass to pour the water i tuned my head and stretched a bit to get the glass. Never got it because when made that  movement my whole neck cracked followed by a loud pop.

So, outside I went to get air.  I found myself sitting on the backyard patio dizzy with severe shooting pains and classic problems like tingling and full blown nausea.  Pain sky rocketed from 2 to 8 in 30 minutes the dizziness was so bad i called 911. I simply couldn't stand up. I was too afraid of falling than anything else. 

So paramedics came in the back gate and transported me to the hospital because that 8 jumped to yikes the second they did that bp was also 145/108 with 110 pain rate.  

The ER doctor was an asshole and wouldn't give me anything addictive including benadryl iv and insisted on a 2nd CT Scan that showed no changes according to him and that I just had a pinched nerve.  I countered with, ""well, why does my neurosurgeon say the screws are loose upon his evacuation of the CT?"" The ER doctor was arrogant and said he must've looked at it wrong because he might've been rushing.  

So he was more than happy to call my neurosurgeon at 6am to evaluate it carefully to calm my nerves but went off shift at 7am. 

Well he calls the neurosurgeon at 6am by this time its been 5hrs and I've recieved oral flexril and an IM benadryl shot. 

Without an IV at 6am the neurosurgeon said i needed an admission so neurosurgeon could be down there and see me/evaluate my 2 CTs and MRI. The ER doc was reluctant to admit me and told me I'd likely go home after the neurosurgeon determined it wasn't serious. 

I almost believed him and almost took him up on the offer to discharge me at that very moment where u could follow up outpatient. I didn't though because by the grace of my higher power my neurosurgeon was going to already be doing  surgeries at the hospital I was at.  So I stuck around to get the MRI read and and calm my anxiety so that i could go home with peace of mind and throw out my flexeril. 

I spent 8hours in tears, but remained calm convinced it was all an 8hr long panic attack. The ER doc went off shift. A new ER doctor came in and just reinforced the original ER doctor's sentiments.

Finally, 10 hours later the neurosurgeon arrives and cofims that I indeed DO HAVE LOOSE SCREWS and ontop of that the whole plate is shifted causing c5 where a spacer is starting to herinate and is punching my spinal column likely causing my severe pain.  He put me on his Operating Schedule for the day ordered me a 1mg dilaudid shot and then 3hours later I underwent major surgery.  

I am currently hospitalized in the ICU following surgery and have been pushing the narcotics off as much as possible. Dilaudid is ordered every 4hrs. I've had opportunities for 4 doses. Due to the medical necessity I am still  43 sober as of today.  

I've been reaching out taking each problem at a time as well as not future tripping. Im also proud for staying calm in the ER and leaving it to my higher power.",1536666878.0
9ewuod,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9ewuod/like_a_freight_train_i_heard_in_the_distance_i/,23,https://redd.it/9ewuod,Adamdkc,"Like a freight train I heard in the distance, I never saw the the tracks I was standing on.","It's hard to pinpoint where this all started. I grew up between 2 houses, parents who divorced before I knew what marriage was. My dad was successful and lived down south in the islands with his former lover and new wife. He only got to see me every other holiday, and some random weekends he would pick me up from the private school he paid for and my mother taught at.

My mom was a paranoid schizophrenic who loved her son as much as she could, given her condition. I had anger issues growing up. Not the kind to predetermine a serial killer or anything, I was just a little confused about why my mother cried at night over the phone to my aunt about the rent and why my dad just bought a new boat. I  guess I didn't understand why two people raising a child together couldn't help one another financially. 

As I got older, i understood that my father paid child support and that Christmas at his house was a literal wonderland. I also began to understand that my father left my mother for the woman who lives in his house, and it ruined her.  

 Before the private school she taught at, my mom hopped around our state a lot, going to school and racking up debt. She was a genius in her own right, but she changed universities quite often pursuing different degrees. One year we found ourselves living in an RV in my aunt's yard. My aunt, who would be my mother's sister, had a son named Daryl. Daryl was a few years older than me, and aside from the common hazing boys give one another, he was always kind to me. I thought it was fantastic, as I could spend as much time with Daryl and his older friends as possible. I couldn't stop thinking about my cool older cousin introducing me to his neighborhood friends. 

The neighborhood happened to be a very rough part of the general Miami metro area called the Wick. As young as I was, I idolized Daryl and his friends. When Daryl got caught drinking schnapps  with our next door neighbor, I snuck a swig while he was being berated in the next room. I thought the shit was disgusting, but I told Daryl about it the second we were alone.

Daryl always did his best to keep me away from his life style and the shit his friends would get into. Later that year my mom and I moved away after she discovered some kind of medical needles under my aunt's bed, and Daryl was arrested for running around the neighborhood naked after drinking some tea he made with some flowers he knew where to find.

Over the years, we would visit on holidays and Daryl would share his weed with me. He was shocked when his 12 year old cousin asked to find him some bud, but he obliged. The stories passed around the family about Daryl got worse over the years, gang mischief, prison for drug trafficking. For some reason, I never felt negativity about the situations. I was always mildly intrigued.

Years go by, and sometime in there my mother takes the easy way out. She decided to stick a garden hose in the tail pipe of our family van, and shove the other end into her car window. Left with one parent I hardly knew and a rebellious attitude, I headed off to an island of rich white folk, where drugs weren't really sold as much as just there. I wasn't really welcome there, i had grown up in a larger area that had a heavy music scene, and I thought that was all the rage.  I met a few kids who got into it as well, and shortly after I had my group.

 In our early years of high school, acid and weed were all the rage for us.  We tripped every weekend, and we always wanted to push it harder than we had previously. If I were forced to pinpoint a time in my life that I should have been alarmed about my interest in drugs and escaping reality, it would be the time my friend Jeff's girlfriend gave me some of her mother's pain meds she didn't take from her cancer prognosis. 

""I can get you this stuff whenever dude. It's not really my thing and my mom is into the whole holistic medicine stuff. Just give me 20 bucks every time i give you a bottle and we'll be square.""

Every time I took the things they made me puke, but afterwards it was bliss. I realized I had to share this with my fellow students, and at age 15 I started moving MS Contin to kids at parties. I had never heard the word opiate before, or seen heroin outside of D.A.R.E., and the idea that these pills Alexa was supplying me with to sell were addictive is something I didnt understand until almost a decade later.

I eventually left that island and went on to my own life, joining the army at 19, discovering painkillers as I know them now around the same time via some army buddies, and some civilian buddies from a college town I lived in before the service. I served my time honorably, drinking whenever possible as infantryman do, and deploying as infantryman also do. I ended my service honorably, with a divorce under my belt and a few Purple Hearts, along with a 70% disability rating from the PTSD I was told I suffered from. I never took the meds, the depression ones made me cold and the insomnia ones made me dead. Instead I found cocaine, and popularity in the waterfront city I moved to after I got out.

Since I have joined this (wonderful) community, there have been a few questions that have cropped up repeatedly both in threads I‚Äôve posted in & also as DMs. 

Most of them run along the lines of ‚Äúwho are you and what are you doing here?‚Äù, ‚Äúdo you even use opiates?‚Äù,   ‚Äúare you a REAL doctor‚Äù & ‚Äúwho the fuck do you think you are‚Äù etc

I don‚Äôt presume that the vast majority of you give a shit, but in order to address a few things, I thought I‚Äôd write a post for this of you who actually care. 

I don‚Äôt wish to be ‚Äúcredentialed‚Äù by the (beautiful, generous and kind) moderators or any of that shit. I‚Äôm human, I make mistakes & I‚Äôm just an average joe, making my way in the world. 

This is not an AMA & under NO circumstances will I give even remotely identifying information. I live in Australia, I have the cliched wife & 2.3 children. I am a chronic pain patient (have been for approx a decade) who also happens to be  a doctor. YES an actual medical doctor (MBBS)

Not a Doctor of Feminist Interpretive Dance or some shit üíÉ 

I will not provide medical advice. However if someone posts up ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sweating really heavily, can‚Äôt breathe, my chest feels really heavy, there‚Äôs a shooting pain in my left arm & I have an impending sense of doom‚Äù, then I reserve my right (as a human being, not a doctor) to tell you in the most vociferous terms possible, to go see YOUR doctor or the professionals at the ER as soon as possible. 

I thought some of you may find my perspective on some things interesting as I am both a long term chronic pain patient & also treat & prescribe opioids for, patients on a regular basis. 

List of answers to common questions:

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm on here for personal reasons. I do NOT represent anyone else or any institution. I thought I may be able to provide some insight from both a ‚Äúpatient‚Äù & ‚Äúprescriber‚Äù viewpoint. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm a smart ass sometimes because it‚Äôs my nature to be whimsical (when I‚Äôm not on the clock so to speak) and I do try to temper my smart assery with at least SOME decent info.

‚Ä¢ Yes I‚Äôm a doctor. Yes. A ‚Äúreal‚Äù one. Yes. Yes the one who prescribes drugs. No I will not prescribe YOU drugs (who knows, if you live in Australia, maybe at some point I HAVE prescribed you drugs..what a mind fuck huh?). 

‚Ä¢ Late thirties (40 is fast approaching üòí)

‚Ä¢ Yes I have Narcolepsy. Yes I take drugs for said Narcolepsy. No it does not affect my ability to work. 

‚Ä¢ PLEASE don‚Äôt message me asking ‚Äúhow do I convince my Doc to prescribe me X/Y/Z drug(s)‚Äù. Not to be rude, but I won‚Äôt respond. You‚Äôll either figure it out or you won‚Äôt. 

‚Ä¢ I‚Äôm NOT your doctor. Questions asking for diagnoses will be sent a generic ‚Äúsee your doctor if it concerns you‚Äù type response. 

Now, WHY am I prescribed painkillers and why have I been on them for the best part of a decade? (None of this provides personally identifying info and no it didn‚Äôt make the papers). 

I‚Äôve ridden motorcycles for years. Since I was 5. Sports bikes are (one of) my passions. 

I was involved in a high speed accident some years ago, when I say high speed I say in the vicinity of 190km/hr (not sure MPH, you can google it) on a public road not a track. We know this because I was wearing a GoPro. No I was not charged as it was an accident. 

I fell asleep. I woke up in a ditch. Everything hurt. I nearly died. My injuries were/are as follows for those interested:

‚Ä¢ Unstable C5/C6 cervical fractures. Stable T1/T2 unstable L4 fractures. 

‚Ä¢ Broken radius/ulna

‚Ä¢ Dislocated shoulder

‚Ä¢ 4 Broken ribs & fractured sternum

‚Ä¢ Broken scapula (doc was VERY impressed with that one).

‚Ä¢ Broken femur & clavicle. 

‚Ä¢Conncussion & mild TBI.

‚Ä¢ Variois soft tissue injuries.

Oh and a unilateral tension pneumothorax. 

Multiple surgeries blah blah. 

But that‚Äôs a snapshot of why I‚Äôm here, why I‚Äôm prescribed painkillers & all that shit. 

Anyway, thanks for reading and if you made it this far, you get a good star ‚≠êÔ∏è

I am hoping I can get some prescriptions for a few months until I can get this under control but so far my only option is to basically go broke and withdraw from oxy and use cannabis aggressively and try and taper off the oxy. 

Now the problem and the reason for the post. I am getting almost suicidal trying to manage without oxy, yet when I take it everything is dandy and it‚Äôs helpful but costly to smoke bud and I can use less opioid, so maybe I can stretch things but I worry about the day I have no oxy and am sick and in pain and suicidal. I know we have methadone clinics nearby that I can self refer to, however I can‚Äôt use methadone and cannabis and don‚Äôt know what methadone is like. I don‚Äôt want to buy pills off dealers as I don‚Äôt actually want to die and I obviously am not ready for heroin if I don‚Äôt want pills and don‚Äôt like spending money on weed. 

Does anyone think methadone would help pain and put me in a mental place I can survive? Is it free? I found Kratom at a head shop but don‚Äôt trust it because it‚Äôs not regulated/tested and as I said am trying to find a way to live without endangering my life. ",1536640278.0

I mean sure occasionally I will find someone selling a few percs and once I was able to buy a very obviously pressed blue 30mg oxy. But overall hydromorphone is the most widely available and used opiate. Every other daily user I've met uses hydromorphone. Even when I was in a car accident at The age of 18 I was written a script for hydromorphone both in the ER and later by my doctor. It seems like it is the go to choice for almost every doctor when writing a prescription as every person I know with a regular opioid prescription is getting hydromorph contin. This really confuses me as it seems like one of the easiest and most rewarding opioids to abuse. I mean they are just these capsule full of extended release beads and they are so easy to crush, not to mention every pharmacy sells pill crushers that make easy work of breaking them down. 

  With the opioid epidemic being such a hot button issue right now it seems odd that doctors will right off the hop write a prescription for one of the most easy to abuse opioids with the largest jump between oral and IV Bioavalibility. Hell the fact that I can only really get hydromorph reliably is the only reason I started to shoot in the first place as I have no problem snorting heroin and popping oxy when I order them online as the smaller jump in potency just doesn't justify the risk for me in the same way hydromorph does. Not to mention the fucking amazing rush you get from shooting hydromorph where as when snorted or plugged it is honestly a pretty average opioid. 

   The last thing I wanted to mention was the price, on the street a 6mg cap will usually go for 20$ and they are always very easy to find at that price however if you get a good connect it isn't too hard to find a 4mg pill for 10$ or even a 6mg for that price. So looking at those prices you can easily see how snorting them really isn't very affordable as they are obviously priced based on the IV dosage.",1536639895.0

What are you guys talking about? As far as I am aware there are at least in the USA state RX databases, and in countries with free government healthcare yea there are permanent computer records. Doctors or hospitals keep records on you, but you have to agree to transfer these or even carry them yourself to the new physician.

But even the state RX databases often only go back so many years, its not lifetime.

&#x200B;

Pick up and leave the state, or wait out the database, go to new doctor and just make some excuse for why you cannot get your old records. Lie and say you have dual citizenship and just got back from a decade abroad etc.

1. How would he find what is in an Oxycodone? He thinks there is oxycodone, but he is trying to find what fillers are added to it.

a. He would also like to find the (not sure how to say this properly) what dissolves what in the makeup.

b. He has used 93% grain Alcohol to dissolve 10mg Ritalin IR, powdered, dissolved, filtered and let air dry until it is a dry power. It packs a punch, but his yield is only about 40%. He was thinking maybe he did not let it dissolve long enough? Any other idea?

2) If he uses the same process on the Oxycodone.

a. Would you use 93% grain alcohol or just water (like CWE) to dissolve?

b. Do you think the product would be a better snort that just crushed? Could you base it?

Ive seen people nod off from a double dose but that's never worked for me no matter how much i take ( although you cut say getting 80mls a day takeaway and inky taking 35 mls a day and selling the rest is a form of abuse. I look at methadone as a medicine I need to take daily just like the pills I need for my chronic illness (without taking them I'd be dead within a month).",1536601386.0

Tomorrow I have to get on a plane to go visit my girlfriends sister. It won't be a long flight and it is not international. We are leaving from the Baltimore airport.


I have a little over a g of dope that I am gonna have to stretch to keep me well out there. I am trying to figure out how to get this past the airport security. We are only bringing carry on bags. Normally when I go anywhere with my dope, I keep it in a crotch pocket. For those of you who don't know, a crotch pocket is made by cutting a horizontal slit in the flap of fabric that is behind the crotch zipper on pants/jeans. You just tuck your shit down there, zip your pants up, and you are good to go. I was planning on doing this until I found out about the full body scanner thing. It's got me a bit worried. I haven't been shooting my dope the last several months (trying to ultimately cut back and quit) and have just been sniffing it, so I don't need to worry about rigs. 



Does any one have any tips or insight as to how i may be able to pull this off? I have no connections where I am traveling to so I kind of need to bring or else be in nasty withdrawals the entire time I am there.


Any help would be appreciated.



Thanks!

EDIT#2: Just a little update. I am at the airport and made it through security. They did in fact have the body scanner. I went with ""put my dope in capsules method"". I had a bottle of 5-HTP vitamins, and the powder with in the capsules was almost identical in color to my dope (light brown). Mixed 3 dope capsules in with the other 15 or so caps of 5-HTP left in the bottle. For good measure I brought two other bottles of different vitamins. I put all three bottles in my carry, and the people scanning the bag didn't even give it a second thought. Suffice to say, this method works very well. 10/10, would recommend.",1536590378.0

Any accounts like this created after then is automatically in violation once we catch it, and will be PMed by one of the mods asked to come back with a different name and banned. These kind of usernames are causing problems for multiple reasons. 

Older accounts in violation that have established karma/post history here may be granted an exception at mod discretion, but for the most part any names like this will not be permitted go post here even if no rules have been broken yet. 


The types of names not allowed and the reasons they are not allowed should be obvious, but here is clarification: 

-examples not allowed: this includes usernames (that are often created with rulebreaking intentions) such as: obvious ones like ""dopesickinXcity"", ""needHinATL"", ""LAoxyplug"" etc; and some less obvious but still not OK names that include area codes, zip codes, etc. or usernames that arent location based but are along the lines of ""PMmeforheroin"" etc. that are clearly intending to source here. Names with just a state in them may be granted an exception at mod-discretion. 

- reasons for this rule: 1) they are often obvious with intentions to break rules 2) they invite potential sourcing from others near you 3) they very often end up leading to location discussion and comments that violate our sourcing, location, or meetup policies and put the entire sub at risk.

At first I didn't.. I hope I feel differently when I awake or at least not so fucking bad about it. 


Basically, yesterday (Saturday) Cliff rang my doorbell. I opted not answer the door, despite it being obvious ppl were home.. I mean like the fucking front window was open. Unless he didn't look up, it was quite obvious.

I didn't know what to do when he rang but I didn't want to come to the door. I hate being at a disadvantage as he's the type to say ""I have an emergency"" and many times I've regretted availing myself for ""emergencies"", or at least realized they were not emergencies either way. Sometimes not even all to inconvenient.


Well whatever, I could go all day. This is is the exact thought which makes me well up with sadness...


#The other day...

Cliff rang my doorbell, I didn't respond. I ran to grab a towel to pretend I was in the shower so that I could say ""I'll swing by to talk later"" and so he wouldn't enter my house with is bed bugs. Then I decided not to bother answering because I didn't want to bother visiting his house to find out some bullshit. well actually, I was on the fence. I texted that I had work and would swing by before work.

&nbsp;
**I checked the front door surveillance camera, and he was standing there..**  I still didn't know what I wanted to do, I just wanted it to end. I checked again and he stood in my driveway a few seconds. Then I texted that I'd swing by around 4pm and he didn't respond... maybe he got the message, maybe his phone was shot.

&nbsp;

Goddamit I feel so awful about this even though the preponderance of history says I really shouldn't. I should be continuing to rejoice that I haven't been dope-sick and that I haven't gotten shafted into pissing way money. 

&nbsp;

I set a reminder to try and make amends tomorrow... at least drop him off a replacement power cord for his computer even though he's a careless slob. I want to do something right to offset the guilt I feel but nothing more as such wouldn't be in my interests. ughhhhh...fuck fuck fuck. This is so fucking paradoxical.

I feel so bad just assuming he's up to no good, or up to something that will annoy the shit out of me but what if he just wanted to check in as a friend? I mean probably not but goddamit I'm in a thought loop. Until I go to find out I wont know either way and will be burdened with guild. Yet it's probably more logical just to push through the guilt and to move on while I can because being cordial might get pounced on.

Kratom? A wonderful plant that, at least works for me. The only downside is the fact that it may get banned?

CBD Oil? The relaxing and pain relieving effects is has on a lot of people don't work for me. It's the non-psychoactive chemicals in cannabis.

Hopefully the government will ease up on doctors and let them do their jobs, instead pf scaring them.

My brother and I are torn on the subject on whether they are made for one use only, bagging heroin... or if they have to be made for something else because there is no way they could be manufactured legally. Are they manufactured in a factory or is it in like a little underground business? I just don‚Äôt get how they could be sold to these convenience stores.

I barely found any answers on Google so I knew if I came here on this subreddit I would definitely find some people that knew the answer! I have been arrested for drug paraphernalia for just having plain, empty bags with no residue which makes me believe they don‚Äôt have another use. At least with marijuana dime bags, the ones with the little zip-loc top, are commonly used for extra buttons when you buy a shirt or for jewelry (earrings or extra charms).

In that span of time I've had some clean time.. sum total of about <5 years in the last 15 I've managed to stay clean.   Always went the cold turkey route.  The last couple years I've used Kratom and benzos to help my withdrawls but I've never been in a MAT program . I've never been to rehab and only been to NA a few random times.  I don't have any user friends, I live in a small mountain town in the Northern Cascades and make the monthly 2 hour drive to the nearest metropolis to buy a piece of tar.  (24 grams for $900).  Quality is solid, not anything to brag about but they use the right type of cut and you don't get abscesses. My family knows I use and a few friends do but no one else in my town.   I've tried countless times to get clean on my own but I've finally admitted to myself I need help. My family is really pushing me to go on methadone. I hate the way suboxone makes me feel, methadone however is tolerable I think.   The few times I've bought people's carries on the black market, I was able to take 50-100mg and feel good. The horror stories about how methadone gets its claws into you are a little unnerving and I am scared I am trading a daily habit of BTH for a methadone addiction that will sink its claws in to me much deeper than the tar ever did.    Because I have no user friends I am not able to get any perspective other than the treatment community and some doctors.. who I just don't trust all the way.

I got into an inpatient facility after a while.  A few days later this woman shows up.  Super cute, but not really my type.  She ends up being in my group for counseling and I'm basically forced to spend the next 28 days hanging out with her.  She ends up being sweet and nice and we get along famously.  She seems overly friendly with me, but I'm just thinking she's looking for a way to pass the time with a little flirty banter. I can dig it. 
       
Anyways, my counselor convinces me to go to some sober living house after I get out of inpatient.  I fight it at first but eventually give in since some of my buddy's were going there too, and really I didnt have much else going on.   I'm not there but 3 days and who should show up?  Same girl.  Once again we end up in counseling together. 
      
 I start hearing from a bunch of my new friends from inpatient that she was seriously into me and I was just being oblivious I guess.  I talked to her and that all checks out.  I wasn't sure what I thought before, but honestly the more I thought about it the more I realized I basically feel that same way. 

There are some pretty strict rules against fraternizing here though.  Plus it's taking up more and more space in my head when I think I should be focusing on being  clean and whatever.  Thanks for taking the time to read, guys.",1536437751.0

I found the news article about dboys arrest, found out his real name, town he's from, etc.

Turns out, he has almost 50 priors (!?) and was on parole. He was arrested after a pursuit in which he was the passenger, and the driver crashed into another vehicle. They both fled, cops found guns in the car, and eventually caught them. 

He's being charged with human trafficking, among other things. Apparently there's been an investigation ongoing since about the time I first met him.

I've lurked here for a while, and I thought it'd be interesting to hear some input from the community. I've been wondering, though- does anyone else use with the hope of ODing in the back of their mind? 

It's not a plea for help, but more an interest in getting an idea of the stats on this type of thinking. Personally, from the very first few times I dabbled in opiates, I've always looked at it as kind of a final destination. I certainly don't plan on ever quitting, and I like to think that I'll eventually slip away in a peaceful nod. That's beside the point, though- what I'm really interested in is how many of these seemingly accidental ODs are really just suicides that drag out over years of attempts. When I inevitably die from this, it certainly won't be an accident or tragedy in my mind. I'm in constant pain from an injury, unable to work anymore, suffered an awful childhood through adolescence, and have been extremely poor ever since birth. 

Sorry for dragging this out, I'm just genuinely curious as to how many addicts are on the same page with me.

I get 2 take homes per week, under normal circumstances, however I just tested (falsely) positive for fentanyl, for the 2nd time in a row. I am using kratom and I'm sure it is this that is causing the false positives. The clinic lets me challenge it with a GC/MS test. The first time this happened it came back in my favor and the take homes were reinstated, after 2 weeks of suspension.

Now, I have tested positive for the 2nd time in a row and will have to wait another 2 weeks to get them back again. I'm pretty fed up. I've not used any illicit drugs besides the kratom, which isn't really illicit and doesn't get me high, but it helps tremendously with my back pain. I'm getting really annoyed with this clinic and I'm probably going to start tapering and get off this junk. It's kept me sober and I'm grateful for that, but a lot of the rules are just stupid. I have to go every single day to dose. I have to go to two 1-hour long groups per week, plus a 30 minute counseling session every week. It really isn't ideal and even if you get the maximum take home allowance (2 weeks worth), you still have to go to those groups and counseling. This 2nd false positive and suspension of my take home medication is going to be the final straw. 

The other thing is I can't smoke pot with my take homes. The only reason I stopped smoking was to get take homes and because I needed to have a surgery and wanted to get in home dosing for afterwards (back surgery, would've SUCKED to go every day to the clinic after that, thankfully I got in home dosing and could just relax and heal up for a bit)

I'm on 40mg btw and this is the highest I've gone up to the whole time I've been on methadone, so tapering shouldn't take too long hopefully, I'm hoping to be off in 4-6 months I guess.",1536418078.0

What did it feel like? 
**Mine hurts but literally wasn‚Äôt there yesterday. Not sure if this dude came near my tits or not but I know we never fooled around. 

Am I gonna probably die?
**I haven‚Äôt felt sick but I started losing weight. Just started a new job that‚Äôs been super physical though. Food hasn‚Äôt been needed much because I figured the alprazalom at night made me not want food much. 

I‚Äôm so scared. Never felt this high in my life. I joke about wanting to die all the time but Jesus Christ I‚Äôm so scared. I can‚Äôt google this shit because I‚Äôm not going to find anything from anything I believe to be true. I need someone I trust anonymously and you guys I trust. Someone please tell me what breast cancer feels like. Please. The reason this is on this subreddit is because I‚Äôve been an opiate junkie since I took my first pain pill at age 16.

I only had a few withdrawal symptoms while using the kratom with like a few hours of withdrawals each day. As soon as I got off the plane I copped and went back to daily usage. This lasted a few weeks until I got kicked out of my oxford house and decided to check myself back into treatment. They sent me to detox first where I expected to hit withdrawals and get subutex but they never came. At most I had the sniffles and anhedonia. The day I checked into detox I shot my last 20 bag of bth at 10 a.m. and around 3 p.m. I ate a few edibles from the dispensary and a half gram capsule of o.p.m.s. Kratom extract and about 2-3 grams of regular leaf. I was also shooting meth intermittently, like 1-2 times a week, meth which apparently had mdma and amphetamine in it because I later popped positive for both. I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone has had any similar experiences with little to no withdrawal or if anyone would know why I didn‚Äôt experience any withdrawal. The last time I went on a run I had zero withdrawal but I was only using every other day for about 3 weeks. I‚Äôm just curious and also worried about my sobriety when the back of my head is telling me withdrawals aren‚Äôt as bad as they used to be.

9dz9qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/9dz9qp/looking_for_advice/,16,https://redd.it/9dz9qp,iksosecac,Looking for Advice.,"My girlfriend and I are heroin addicts in recovery. We have significant clean time(multiple years) with the help of Suboxone/Subutex and one another, not to mention having been blessed with our first child. She's 16 weeks pregnant and has been taking Subutex legally through a private Doctor, but has been having issues the last 4 times she's taken a Urine Drug Screen. She keeps coming up positive for Opiates AND Buprenorphine, which is crazy to me considering that people usually don't take both together because of the higher affinity the Buprenorphine has for the opiate receptors, making full agonists like Codeine and Morphine unable to produce desired effects. She knows this very well, and I know what she's saying about not having been using is the truth. We live together and spend almost every minute of every day together. She's scared out of her mind because despite having told her provider that she hasn't used with our child in her stomach, making him take a blood test for a second time to attempt to prove she's not making this shit up, that she's literally been coming up positive for opiates for quite some time when she's not taking anything but Subutex and a Prenatal Vitamin (prescribed by her OBGYN and produced through her pharmacy, not some unregulated brand from the vitamin isle.).

&#x200B;

She is scared of having to be thrown off this medication that will put her and our child in danger, but she's not sure what to do considering she's not sure why this is happening to her. She's not able to just stop using to be able to pass her  tests because unlike most people that go into these Dr. Offices and deny the outcomes of their Urine Drug Screens, She is unable to just stop doing what's causing positive results on these drug tests because she really isn't doing opiates.

&#x200B;

I don't have any clue as to what the cause is, I just know that she's been on her Subutex and not making this up. I live with her and she's been sober. It's not just another addict trying to lie their way out of trouble. I need some help.

&#x200B;

Does anyone know what may be causing something like this or know of any similar cases? I would appreciate any ideas or advice. Please don't be hesitate to ask questions or share your experiences of anything relevant to this post. Thanks Reddit.",1536359755.0

this is a long time coming and I am finally making the move to get clean.  I have been using prescription  pills for decades now and I realize that I can't spend the second half of my life like I have since my 20s.

&#x200B;

I was never a hard abuser.  Stayed with the prescribed dosage, but I have always had them in my system.  Started like many do.  I had surgery to reattach a finger, got pain meds for it, and it snowballed after that.

Currently I am using 10/325mg Norco.  4 a day.  And I have never wavered from that.  But I do know that I am going to have some physical withdrawal and I am not looking forward to the feelings of withdrawal. 

&#x200B;

I have done my reading and I have gotten prepared, I just want to run down my plan and see if any of you kind folks have any other suggestions I can add into the mix.  

I preface this by saying that I am not going to use alcohol, weed or other narcotics to help with the process.  Seems foolish to rob Peter to pay Paul.

&#x200B;

I have about 15 of the pills left, and I was going to split them in half, and take half a pill 3x a day during the beginning of the detox.

&#x200B;

My doctor prescribed me with .2mg clonidine #40.  I was planning on taking one of those 4x a day with the option to split the pills if the .2mg was too much.

&#x200B;

I have a couple boxes of Walmart loparamide 2mg gel tabs, and figured 6 a day would help with some of the achey feelings as well as the possible diarrhea.  I also have a box of Benadryl for help with the sneezing and runny nose.

&#x200B;

Anyone who has experience with this, I welcome your insight.  I am really looking forward to not always checking my pocket to make sure I have a couple pills with me where ever I go.  I am looking forward to not having the hassle of making sure I get my refill in time, and that I don't have to go into a pharmacy and feel like they are looking at me funny.  And mostly I am looking forward to actually being myself and not keeping this lie going that nobody but me knows about.

&#x200B;

thank you in advance, I really appreciate the help and insight.  I am hoping that by this time next week I am well on my way to being the true me.

It all started with his classic, ""It's an EMERGENCY"". Well, not exactly. Let's try to run through some chronologically ordered text messages. I'll also be sure to reference the less frequent voicemail and AIM. Yes, I said AIM. No, we are not using AIM but the name will be used in this post as a catch-all term for any form of web-based messaging; examples include AIM, ICQ, Hangouts, Viber, ~~that shit girls use on dating sites~~ whatsapp, Telex, and Telegram.


&nbsp;



It could be said that it started last week on the third when Cliff texted me asking if I could bring some canned-air over (Dust-off).


Cliff:
>I figured after work do u have the spray for the keyboard? i need it 4 the keyboard. I'd stop by to grab it if ok lata[.]



Of course I asked if he needed a liquid spray or dustoff - this being the colloquially accepted name for Dust-Off. To which he responded to indicate that the keys are sticking on the laptop I gave him months ago. 

In his words,
>IDK whatever u think is better for keys that are stickin down[.]


What the fuck is a can of compressed air going to do to fix sticky keys? I mean yeah, I guess in theory you could flip the can upside down, spray out the freezing cold low boiling point liquid and use it to freeze what I assume to be sticky cola residue. **More on that impractical theory below as well as a legitimate solution to removing chewing gum from fabrics with great ease!** Anyway, compressed-air being used as intended is not going to make sticky keyboard keys any less sticky. 


&nbsp;

I didn't jump to assist because I didn't feel like it. Plus, expending effort only reinforces that it's okay for Cliff to be careless with his laptop. I'm not saying that I'm an angel but when I take measures to avoid spilling any amount of liquid on my computer. When I do get something on it, I take immediate action and the majority of my careless involves crumbs of food.  

&nbsp;

In Cliff's case, soda seems to be the top culprit although other solids do accumulate. Two laptops ago, he opened a bottle of soda and the fizz sprayed onto his keyboard. My advice? Suck it out of the keyboard with a vacuum or your mouth while holding it upside down. That's what I would do if I spilled liquid on a button on the front of my phone, and I've done it when I've spilt liquid between the buttons on my touch-pad.

&nbsp;

Of course I didn't offer to do that for Cliff and he didn't follow my advice to do so. I can't blame folks for not listening but that is the only quick way I know of to prevent damaging buttons on personal devices after a beverage spill. After a quick wipe down the computer worked fine for the next day or two. Then otu of nowhere two days later he couldn't turn it on - ""the orange light blinks when I try to turn it on."" No shit, you spilled something in it. ""It worked fine after..."" I hate when people ask the expert but wish to get an answer which doesn't involve blaming themselves. I don't give a fuck if your computer worked fine for two days after you spilled something on it - I'm still certain that the original spill is the root cause to any electrical problems which occur a couple of days later.


&nbsp;


Many people who are careless with electronics never admit to wrongdoing. The same with the power cord for his MacBook which I'm about to replace. A while back he bought a MacBook from me, the power cord was shit and went bad from metal fatigue. I repaired it and he fucked it up himself. Before I replaced the cord I was like ""you gott atake care of the replacment cord, you can't just throw it around on the floor"" and he was like ""I'll take care of it, I don't throw my my computer on the floor."" Then of course I watched him do just that when he was barred out. After that when the power cord stopped workign the second time, I didn't bother to rush to replace it.



It has gotten to the point where he basically doesn't even remember that I owe him a power cord for his MacBook. Back when he did remember he'd state, ""I paid for that comptuer in full""; he was so proud - or once in his life he paid something off. Of course he only paid the fina linstallment the first time around because his power cord went bad and he knew empty promises would not get me to hustle. 

&nbsp;






So why do I suddenly want to get him his replacement power cord? I have a feeling that his laptop keyboard is more fucked up than he's revealing. I've accumulated more MacBook power cords recently - so I figured first I'll round them all up in a box and test them. Determine which ones do and don't work. Then I'll go through the non-working ones and determine how many of them are easy to fix. I might even give him one that is currently working but I do prefer to give him a broken one that gets repaired because he doesn't really deserve a fresh Mac power cord in good condition, he'll just fuck it up anyway.



Right now I don't fully command the moral high-ground and wont until I follow through on my word to provide a working replacement power supply for his MacBook. The MacBook is probably sitting in a pile of laundry. For all I know a rat pissed on it. Yet another reason to give him a shitty hand-repaired power cord.



&nbsp;

Plus, I suspect that his current keyboard woes on the random Dell laptop I gave him in the past are going to make that machine unusable without full disassembly and I am in no longer have the inclination to do that shit for his sake.

&nbsp;



#TL;DR:

**What is Cliff's current emergency?**

I speculate that it is related to the initial request for Dust-Off because his ""keys are sticking down"", however there is more.


**The other day I was biking to work** and his sister was sitting out front with her nodded down. I waved, got no response and kept going. A few minutes later Cliff texts,

> U just biked past me, thanx for ignoring me all weekend! I really had an emergency.

This message is in reference to when he texted earlier in the weekend, **""Call me ASAP it's emergency really !""** I never call Cliff when he asks me to call him regarding an emergency. For a multitude of reasons.


So when I was biking to work, I gave some BS excuse about being busy.. doesn't really matter because I reserve the right to not care. Anyway, he goes on,

>Can u text me after work when u get home? Don't worry I'll remind ya""


Well then, I guess I don't gave to text him after work, he'll remind me. Anyway, I had to see Danika for subs after work so that was my top priority. As far as Cliff is concerned I'm clean and not even on subs right now. I figured earlier on that was the best impression to perpetuate so he doesn't plan around my supply of subs being his safety net.


Anyway, I responded to that ""text me after work"" request by saying, ""Plus I didn't' even know what the emergency hype was about.""

He states,

>Its not cash or drugs or anything like that. **It was a life and death matter no joke**


So I ask, ""asthma?""

He goes on,

>Something like that, you goin to b around 2nite?
>I got all my goodies lol


I guess that last point is to indicate that he doesn't need anything because he has been resupplied. I continued by stating that I ""got off work late and had to be in early after."" Then he asks,


>Maybe 2nite we catch up for 15 minutes or so?

Arghh, whenever he needs something from me and I'm not biting asks in that format. Variations of, ""pick up your phone for just two minutes"" or the 15-20 minutes which inevitably turns into 50-60 minutes. Maybe it shouldn't be so hard to sit down and catch up with a ""friend"" but I can't afford to expose myself to his bed bugs and I fucking hate the smell which sticks to my clothes on humid days. I fucking don't feel like exposing myself to the smell of raw garage on this warm and humid rainy day.

I didn't respond later when he asked ""whats up?""


Nor did I respond when this morning when he texted, 


>Text me when u awake[.]


&nbsp;


He had plenty of opportunities to explain why he needs my presence. I've been left to speculate above but as much as I suspect it's electronics related, he did say ""something like that"" when I asked if it was asthma or a matter of his mom falling down on the floor which happens on occasion.

If he said his mom had fallen, I'd be quick to jump but ""life of death"" could be anything. Sine he says it's not drugs or money (the top of my list of life or death), it must be his computer. You know, sometimes it could be life or death. Maybe he's trying to fill out some insurance paperwork and the web page isn't working - that's like life or death to him. Still, probably isn't quite that.... I don't want to take a chance.


&nbsp;

My plan is to do turtle and tortoise tank maintenance, eat a bit more and then go on a long bike ride. Maybe during my long bike ride I'll call him from the convenience of my Bluetooth headphones. I will not risk placing a phone call like that or answering while I'm still home or in the neighborhood. I don't want to have a sudden moment of weakness, or accidentally slip into saying I'm available to come through. 


&nbsp;

Assuming it's not related to money or drugs...

&#x200B;

In my country Ireland I have only ever heard Methadone dosage referred to as Mls (Milliliters). Clinic starting dose is usually 30 mls. 80-90 mls is what Doctors here consider the dose that pretty much filled the receptors meaning you need a huge dose of heroin to break through and feel anything. 

&#x200B;

120 - 130 mls is usually what Doc's will allow people go to with the intention of making using heroin practically useless although I have heard of people going to 180mls in rare cases. Individual Doctors here have a lot of power over what prescription you get.

&#x200B;

Anyways my question is Does anyone know the conversion chart for mls to mgs?

All oral ROA:

100mg Flexeril  
100mg Oxycodone (pure, IR)

16mg Zofran

3 Manhattans

&#x200B;

All of this was over the course of about 2 hours, with all pills being taken at once at the start. Here I am about 3 hours from initial ingestion and I'm already feeling everything wearing off. What. The. Fuck. I feel like this is enough to kill an elephant, but I barely got to enjoy a ride for 2 hours. I was even on an empty stomach with a few snacks during the build up! So my question, somewhat rhetorical: what the hell is wrong with my body? Shouldn't this be enough to give someone else a first class, direct flight to the ER? Yet here I am basically feeling wired for sound and ready to take a shower and go to work!  


Since I have access to numerous meds of all kinds (Tramadol 50mgl, Norco 7.5/325, Oxycodone 10mg IR, Hydromorphone 2mg, Atarax 50mg, Lexapro - don't know the dose, Flexeril 10mg), I have many ways to try and float away for a bit. Is maybe my tolerance just too high to enjoy these recreationally? 100mg each of Flexeril and 100mg Oxycodone combined with a bunch of bourbon seems like it should do the trick, but alas no.

So I wanna share a bit about my experience w suboxone, as I see a lot of comments on here about how its so hard to kick, and also how it's not ""really clean."" I started using at 19. I went from a working class chick taking pills to a stripper/escort doing IV tar heroin in about 3 yrs time, then in another 4 yrs I had become a fuckin panhandler and scam artist living in a tent. To say I didn't give a fuck about ""really clean"" when I got on the subs is an understatement. I just wanted to not die a bum with a needle in my arm. When I first got on the suboxone I figured I'd be on it for life. After getting off the streets and waiting tables for a few years, I ended up going back to school for a degree, and I decided I wanted to be off the subs by the time I graduated. I stared to wean down from 8 mgs per day. I weaned VERY SLOW. Like 1 mg every 6 months. Now, here is the key. When I got down to 1 mg, I then started taking .5 mgs EVERY OTHER DAY. Then .5 every day for a while, then alternating. 5 w .25 every other day. And so on. I did not go thru withdrawal people!! All in all I was on the suboxone for 7 yrs. The key is to change your life, and TAPER SLOW.
Wish this story had a happier ending kids, but after 5 years off the subs and being a ""productive member of society"" I had a ""midlife crisis"" and relapsed on morphine pills, which I fuck around with on the dl like the asshole I am. K thanks for listening, love u all, bai!",1536283805.0

I've never gotten completely off opiates since then bc now I'm on suboxone. So I was wondering the question in the title and also how bad are suboxone withdrawals?

I was able to hit it without a tourniquet and register. However it hurt to push the plunger. I've hit an artery before and had my hand swell up and the blood was kind of frothy when it rushed into the rig. 

This time the blood wasn't the dark maroon red but was like kind of like blood from an artery. However the blood didn't flood the rig and wasn't foamy. I injected and it started to burn however I was in. I finished the shot in my neck because I didn't want to keep feeling that pain. It was a new syringe too. 

Is this an artery even though the blood wasn't frothy and fill the rig on its own? I have a lump at the injection site now and it is kind of sore.  I only pushed about 15 units before relocating",1536272672.0

I was parked at a store a block away and around the corner from the hotel my dealer lady is working out of. Or was anyways.  Anxiously searching for my scale, cooker, rig and lighter from inside the seat.  Snot drips onto my lap and I wipe my eyes and nose when I hear my phone.

"" I'm sending someone with it now. Double check weight when you get it"" 

""Ok"" I say back to her. In supposed to be looking for some asshole in a blue shirt. I hope he doesn't short my bag. I am only picking up enough for my girl and I to get well. We are quitting here today..ok tomorrow. But we have to quit! I'm going on a trip with family three states over and she is going to stay with her fam while I'm gone. There's only two days before the trip and we want to get some kratom or sub in our system before we have to see family. 

""Where the fuck is this guy"" I say to my girlfriend. It's been 10 minutes on the dot and it's a small city block. I decide to do a lap around the store I'm parked at . No dude"" 

"" he's not here.. i checked the area and street. "" 

"" I'm coming"" she says. Weird. I thought she was sending a runner. Shits hot right now. Cops are getting into this circle I'm in and I know she is first on the list since they got her boyfriend last week. 

5 minutes pass and I see her walking towards us. 
"" she's all done up for us today huh?"" I laugh and gesture towards the mirror where my girl could see her approaching us. Wearing baggy grey sweats, pink tanktop, crazy fuckin hair and a grey, loose fitting hoody. Aviators to top it off. 

"" here you go, sorry my guy didn't see you I guess"" 

"" yeah I didn't see him either. How's things going with your man? He had court right?"" 

"" yeah he did. Couple charges dropped but they added possession for some reason. He should get out..but his parole fucks this up you know?"" 

"" fuck, yeah I forgot. I hope he gets out. Hell, I wish I  could bail him out. He's a fuckin good guy you know. "" 

"" yeah, fuckin cops. Well I'm going back to the roon. Don't want to be out too much haha. Be safe"" 

"" you be safe! Keep us updated please"" 

She cuts off a car pulling in to the parkinglot by walking in front of it, right when they pulled in off the street. We laugh at her and she laughs and glares at the driver of the car as she goes back. 
"" they're parking next to us so keep your shit down "" is what I say to my lady as I'm cooking my shot like it was a life or death situation. Shoot dat shit or , die I think. The car pulls into the spit next to us, I lean over and stare at them and see they're kinda mean looking Mexican dudes so I assume they're cool and they just look back at me blankly. Awkward. Then, they back up, two point reposition car angle and park in a spot behind us and down a space or two. 

We do our shit but leave about a half a point each. Cottons still soaked so if shit doesn't work out later, we have that .05 and a cotton to rinse. I grab a soda and pull out onto the road. Crack the pop i bought and it's so good. Just got well and it's warm,  ice cold sweet sweet vanilla coke. Not my favorite but it's what I could get. 

I'm headed to grab my friends cash so i can middle a half g for him and his girl. They re sick down the road so I turn off onto their road. Slide into a spot next to him and he gets out immediately.  Ad soon as he hits my window and starts talking- red and blues.  ""What the fuck man"" I look at him like it's his fault. I've sold to this guy about 20 times in two weeks.  But he's not acting guilty. He's actually doing a damn good job improv bullshitting the cop and setting up our aliby before my eyes. I hand my license and shit to the cop. 

Another cop suv. K-9. Blocks us in and two men get out. Another suv, pulls I'm next to us, two more men. A silver Chevy car pulls in past that. Oh fuck.. this isn't good at all. It's the car from the store. That she cut off. They stayed behind us that whole fucking time. I'm hiding shit the best I can. While they're all making their way to the doors of my truck. 

"" you just here to play a little game of pool huh? "" 

"" yes sir! My friends and I here are on a little double date and we haven't played in years so hell why not right? 

"" yeah,  why not.  Hey, since you're just here for that, nothing illegal,  would you mind if we searched the car? "" 

""Well I wouldn't mind but I do not consent to it yet. Why do you feel the need? 

Rising from the silver car a Mexican man I recognize now as a local narc team member. He throws his vest on and walks over. 

"" because that's how we catch the bad guys sometimes kids"" the narc says. 

"" fine. Lock box under my seat,  scale inside middle seat, two knifes on me, bullets in the doors of the truck, no guns and my dogs are nice."" 

""You can take the dogs to the sidewalk with you""

As they proceed to dig into my shit like little fuckin pigs in a slop trough the narc comes yo me and sits down. ""You know why I'm here. "" 

"" why officer? I'm afraid I dont, this is a lot of fuss over a seatbelt isn't it?"" I shoot him a smile and he laughs 

"" yes well it's not that. It's what you did at that store back there.  You met up with  (my dealer) and she talked with you.  You then exchanged something and she walked off. What was all that about "" 

"" Well I met my friend there and she gave me this five bucks she owed me  from the other night. That's all. Why?"" 

"" becAuse she sold you dope, you shot up right there and bought a soda and she went back to room xxx at the hotel.  You then moved down here to meet with your friends here and I'm assuming sell then dope. That true "" 

"" nosir. I in fact got this money and that's that.  Your right though.  I did do a fat shot right there. That soda was great too"" 

He leaves.  Well fuck me. They have been watching all of us. Thank God I wasn't actually re upping. Although, if I was Doing that things would have went down differently and I would have a back middle pocket filled to the brim with black and meth.  

"" Ok so its on tape. I'll show you.  Also your girl admitted that I was right. "" fuck "" also, she doesn't have a phone so I'll confiscate yours now "" fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fucky fuckin fuck.  

After taking it to his car, he stays there a while. I pet my dogs,  have a cigarette and exchange the looks of great concern with my girl and my two friends who are inside playing pool . It's not looking good. He returns with my phone. 

"" I copied your texts but you encrypted your phone I noticed so you can just have it back. Tracphones are nearly useless to me anyways"" 

Yikes. This clown is really serious about fucking me in the ass today. He asks me about my habit and also offeres me a cigarette. Then the question ive been waiting for. "" you want to help me help you or go to jail "" 

Ok. So I do want to go in these family trips. I have guns and those rights are about to be toasted big time . "" yeah of course"" 

He tells me how the buy will go down and I'm acting all for it, a little hesitant to it at first but who wouldn't be. My plan was to agree to do it tomorrow. I would need more drugs. By then and it would seem legit. I would then hide from the cops until my out of state adventure. I would also be in deep shit when I got home . 

He wouldn't do it . He wanted to do it right then.  No fucking around. I decline and get cuffed and put into the car with my girl. I leave my keys and dogs with my friends and that's it. Game over. We get to the jail and they book us but it's full. It's 6pm and they do not let people out after dark. They stick us into solitary holding cells. No blankie.  Crazy fuckers in other cells scream, bang on the door and cry.  This will be a good night.  

I get a migraine from the stress, noise, smell of the cell and also the milk. They notify us at midnight we can leave if we have a ride. My girl calls her dad and he is on his way. Be there in 15. Hour or more passes and we get out.  Walking to the parkinglot and we are greeted with her whole family.  They freak out and take me to my truck and keep her with them.  

I'm pretty upset at this point . Can't leave state. Can't own or use guns, mugshot is online for everyone to see.  Fuckin fantastic situation boys. I'm pretty unhappy about all of it tbh.

($280/month) It‚Äôs due on the 4th of each month, and I am usually able to have enough cash to pay it with some extra money for food, gas, drugs, etc. 

Last month I was late by 10 or 11 days so they got me with a $20 late fee, whatever, no big deal so I owed $300 instead of $280 this month, My thinking is so fucked up that I lie to myself saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just pay it with the money I get from the very last minute‚Äù at work and hope and pray that I‚Äôll get enough tip $ to be able to pay it. 

I make $13 and hour OFF the books plus tips, so it‚Äôs a good job for a 20 year old guy. However this time I said ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù I‚Äôm soooo sick with diarrhea, hot/cold sweats, painful cramps, runny nose, vomiting, restless legs, lack of quality sleep, depression through the roof, anxiety, crying my eyes out, etc. 

I‚Äôve been through withdraws more times than I can count but this time around they were absolutely horrible. I had close to enough money to pay it, I just needed to work 2 more shifts and I would have enough without being more than 10 days late. (Progressive allows for 10 days late before they stop your policy)

SO, I decided to spend the last of my money on heroin  instead of putting it aside for my insurance premium. I‚Äôm writing this now feeling tremendously good compared to this morning and early afternoon. HOWEVER, I‚Äôm not going to be able to pay it before the 10 day grace period and I‚Äôm concerned that Progressive will discontinue my policy. In all honestly I‚Äôm high as GIRAFFE  PUSSY right now and I don‚Äôt even care!  

I know this was NOT the right thing to do, I know I‚Äôm going to get sick tomorrow but I‚Äôm the king of procrastination and putting things aside for a different day. I‚Äôm so stupid for this, but I hope someone else can read this and learn from my mistakes, if you‚Äôre new to opiates. If you‚Äôve never been through withdrawals you‚Äôre in for a wake up call. They suck donkey dick, and personally, I‚Äôll do anything including risking my car insurance being cancelled so I can get high for one night. 

Anyway, I hope everyone else is having a better day than me, and staying safe! Happy Thursday guys and gals! ",1536270200.0

I have been calling pain clinics and have been told I still need a gp to follow me but they give lidocaine injections and I‚Äôm wondering if they are helpful and also how will I find a new dr for the oxy? 

As well I realize I could be managing my pain a bit better if I had less of a tolerance to oxy and cannabis and am looking for peer support around how to decrease my tolerance while still having control over my pain and living my life. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any support, that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm looking for is a community of peers.

I‚Äôm on hydro 5mg now, get 30 a month and my plan is to just let them know that while its nice to have them, I REALLY have to make them stretch! Like have to compromise with myself to be in pain at work or hanging with my family to save my recommended dose to take at night to actually get to sleep so I can take care of my shit the next day, and the cycle repeats. Im not expecting to walk in there and get a script of oxy 30s or something. I just want to know what to expect I guess... I‚Äôm also mid 20s with degenerative disks from a motorcycle accident, so not just seeking. 

Also, for the people who do go through PM and partake in other things (weed, or the occasional un perscribed opiate) how do you deal with the contracts/drug tests? ",1536257505.0

I had constant panic attacks and a drug induced fear of people. I'd assume everyone was better than me the moment I met them. It took dozens of tries, some forced, some genuine, to finally get a bit of time together. Today I feel normal. I can look people in the eye and hold a full conversation. When I was about 17 my mom said to me "" I wish I could say you just fell in with the wrong crowd, but you ARE the wrong crowd"". Today, she tells me she's proud of me. I've had the same home, job, and phone number for almost a year. This from a guy who once lived 9 different places in a year. Idk I just have been thinking of relapsing and kind of needed to make a gratitude list. I know the writing is shitty I was trying to avoid having a huge wall of text.

He popped for fentanyl, heroin,  methadone, coke, oxy, and God knows what else.

And his doctor didn't believe it! He didn't believe it because he didn't think my roommate would be walking on all that (note -- his original injury was a smashed ankle). 

The office called him and asked him to redo the test and they were sooooo apologetic. Of course when he redid it he came up clean for everything except what the doctor prescribed.

The dose would be liquid methadone 25mg.

Reasons Im considering waiting.

1. I have to work a double shift as a server in a fast paced fine dining type restaurant. I work blasted almost everyday just fine. My doses vary from 2 to 3pt of H or most recently its been 160mg of OC. RoA is IV

2. I did 30mg OC an hour ago. If I took methadone today it would add 25mg of that into the mix.

3. My boss and coworkers are chill but definitely have been noticing if I use a particularly heavy amount. Not on blast yet but definitely not wanting to in full zombie mode at all.

So I am prescribed these awesome little Valium drops. The ingredients are PG, PEG and diazepam. It also says purified water in one ingredient list I found. 

Now, I've just been banging these straight mostly but PG is thick and is very hard to push through a 27g needle. PG is water soluble so I figured I could dilute it down with some water to thin it out, so I added a ml to my 3 ml shot and immediately some cloudy white shit starts to form. After googling intensively I find out that you're not supposed to mix iv valium with other meds for this reason. Now my question is is there any other way to thin it out? Plus, Mine is an oral solution (no sugar/syrup) is there anything that could be more dangerous than shooting the vials? It seems to be the same ingredients as the vials anyway. Is it really the case that you can't add PG-benzo solutions to water? That's a real shame because I was looking forward to mixing some nice valium-morphine and valium-fentanyl shots. ",1536243097.0
