Feel like I'm gonna explode...,"I last did dope 6 days ago and have been taking kratom on and off ever since, with a hint of xanax that's unfortunately no longer accessible.  

Like a lot of us, I kind of fell into an opioid addiction without even knowing it.  ""Percs"" and ""vikes"" seemed pretty harmless in high school.  I've always been one to do my research before taking chemicals and preserving my mental capacities has always been important to me, so when I saw that opioids were generally non-neurotoxic in and of themselves I became interested.  Then of course when I first tried three 5mg percocets and felt that subtle yet unmistakeable warmth and euphoria, I knew that was something that I liked.  Then high school came around and I was relatively popular as an athlete, I went to parties and smoked weed with the ""cool kids"" so of course someone had percocets, lortabs, tramadol, etc. once in a while and I'd always pounce on the opportunity to have a blissful experience with what was quickly becoming my favorite class of drugs.  I didn't think much of it because I was never anywhere near withdrawals or ODing and I have always done pretty well in school, etc. which didn't change but slowly I began thinking about opioids more.  I started reaching out to weed dealers to see if they knew anyone who could find painkillers and usually didn't find much until one time senior year of HS I found this naive kid who had a ton of oxycodone to sell.  He had 30mg IRs and 80mg XRs but he thought the 30s were worthless because they were ""so much lower dose than the green ones"".  I agreed to take all of the 30s off of his hands and he was pretty happy and allowed me to count out how many were left in the pill bottle (LOL!) and take them.  I happily paid dollars per 30mg pill, of which the bottle contained close to 60 but I said only had half of that in it.  60x30mg roxies may not sound like a ton to some seasoned veterans of the game, but for me at the time I had hit a gold mine.  I took them every night for a couple weeks and for the first time I experienced mild opiate withdrawals.

Then I got to college and found this kid who was selling bars and fent pressed 30s.  I quickly got into the habit of alternating between the two, taking one of each per week, etc. - until I started feeling really off without the drugs.  I started getting anxious, having cravings, and some of the depressive and OCD tendencies I've always had became amplified exponentially.  I stopped taking bars and opis and felt better after a while but I always had opioids in the back of my mind.  Eventually this kid didn't have the fake roxies anymore so I ventured into the nearest big city, talked to some people, and ultimately got super lucky - finding this guy who supplied me with several numbers of d boys who would deliver.  I am on the east coast and my city has a pretty good ECP scene so after doing oxies for so long I didn't think too much of snorting some ECP.  In fact, I was pretty excited!  I've been on this sub for long enough that I've heard so many grievances against fentanyl vs real heroin so, given how much I enjoyed my shitty fent blues and oxycodone, I couldn't wait to try some pure ECP.  It didn't quite live up to expectations for the first couple of dealers, but it was unprecedentedly cheap, accessible, and definitely did the trick.  Needless to say, when I finally found a guy who consistently has that fire - I was hooked.

I only tried IVing a couple of times, very early on in my h use surprisingly, and luckily haven't been tempted to go back there since because I'm too paranoid about it.  Otherwise, I've decently kept my life together.  Nobody REALLY knows about my issues.  Of course my parents have found some suspicious things but I've always been able to talk my way out of it.  My friends kinda know I ""used to"" like oxies but think I'm clean and know nothing of my heroin use.  My girlfriend has seen me nod out multiple times but I've always been able to blame it on other things.  I've kept to a ""chipping"" regiment decently well, where I binge for a few days, wd for a few days and feel regretful/depressed/shitty, then start to feel better and after a week want to go cop again.  This has been going on for the last idk how long now and I'm just kinda like wtf now.  The ONLY thing that makes me happy is heroin and I'm this young.  I have so many amazing and hopeful things that I could be thinking about but all I can think about is getting that vinegary powder up my nose - I know that I can't go on like that.

I am getting ready to graduate from a very good university with honors and move on to one of the ""flashiest"" jobs of anyone I know, I have a loving family, a great girlfriend - and yet I feel like I'm going to explode. I feel like my general unhappiness is what drives me because I always think that if I can just get that next thing, maybe I'll be happy but as we all know those moments of happiness are very fleeting. Ultimately it all just leads to more guilt.

Why can't I just appreciate what I have? Why don't I have more energy to engage with my girlfriend? I miss my family so much, why am I ignoring their calls? What happened to all of my friends?

Self-medication has made it even worse. I'm sitting here trying to maintain this ultra-high standard I've held myself to for my entire life, allow my fucked up dopamine levels to normalize, but most of all just get out of bed in the morning without some substance to help me - all at the same time. I regret so much and feel like it is all my fault that I feel this way. If I had only spent more time with my family when I was younger instead of going out drinking, if I had only cultivated better friendships instead of trying to escape, the list goes on.

But despite all of the amazing people that love me, I can't talk to anyone about this. Nobody that I associate with really openly has mental health or substance issues and nobody would expect me to be that person. There have been signs of course, I've blacked out drinking one too many times in front of family and my girlfriend, but I've been able to play it off as ""too fratty"" and reckless rather than troublesome. I'm such a good liar, I have always had this thought in the back of my mind that I should've been an actor because of how easily I can deceive people. I've lied my way out of being ""found out"" so many times that it's become second nature and begun to bleed into other areas of my life, and I hate it. I want so badly to be the person I portray myself as. I WANT to be the happy, successful young man from the loving family, the loving boyfriend, sibling, and son that I know I am but somehow I find away to screw myself into stupid situations.

Anyway, I'm sitting here fighting what feels like a battle for my life to get ""back on track"" despite the fact that literally nobody else on this planet knows I'm having any problems.  I am sorry for this painfully long post but I have nobody in the world to share this with and needed to get it out.

Good luck everyone, I still believe things will get better.",1526258223.0

As the title says, I was on opiates (mainly heroin) for around 3 years. After meeting a wonderful, beautiful girl, I decided enough was enough and went to a doctor(outpatient) to start Suboxone maintanance. I think just taking subs for a few days to get off a multiple year habit is a bit naive, your likely to still want your DOC after, I mean it's only been a few days. So I did the opposite, and spent around 2 years going about this process, which included therapy, it was expensive but quite worth it now that I look back. I started at 8 mg (sub) a day in the beginning and worked my way down to just sections of a point, not a discernible amount by any means. Yes, going down was tough but i had Gabapentin in the beginning of the taper and both Gabapentin and Clonidine in the end. WHAT A COMBO FOR WITHDRAWAL, highly recommended. So, it's been 3 weeks since my very last Suboxone dose and I truly feel like myself again. I have all this energy that I haven't had in years. I feel sharp again, quick witted, and man my sex drive is through the fucking roof. While your on subs you feel like it's not really having any discernible effect on you, you feel... normal. BUT, once off them you realize that the suboxone was indeed dragging you down, keeping you a bit low, and severely emotionally distant. I'm full of love and emotion, so much so that I don't know what to do with it all. It's. Just. Great. I was really worried throughout this entire process that I'd never be the same person I was prior to my addiction, but 3 weeks in and I know that I'll be back. I'm not all the way there yet, but I couldn't feel better given the situation. 12 days ago I took a (required) UA with my doctor. There was no longer any suboxone in my system. I'm finally through this nightmare and our the other side to speak about it.

I was wondering if anyone had a different outlook on that decision, and didn't deeply regret it.

I find myself at this very crossroads right now; I have been using heroin for 5 years now (4 years smoking on the west coast, 1 year sniffing on the east coast), and i've reached a point where I can barely even get well sniffing. My nose is totally fucked, so my choice is pretty much get sober or switch to IV, and I know I'm not ready to get sober. I've been looking for tar, but haven't been able to find any in my small east coast city. I never even considered switching to IV when I was smoking tar, I found the fix satisfiying from day 1 to the end of the 4 years, but unfortunately nasal use just doesn't do it for me, and has a host of unpleasant complications. I am not looking for people to help me justify switching to IV, as I know its not a justifiable decision to make. Its practically suicide. But as we all know addiction defies logic.

So yea, irregardless of my situation, I was just wondering if there was anyone out there who didn't regret ""graduating"" to IV opiates.",1526249350.0

I know about 6 other users whom I smoke with and buy with. They all say that my reaction is very unusual and they all get concerned for me. The weird part is I always thought this was a normal side effect of heroin. Let me describe what happens. 

The first few times I tried smoking H, I was find. I didn't even think it tasted that bad. 

Then one day it all started tasting HORRIBLE and still does to this day. Very very strong sour rotten vinegar/BBQ. The taste would start to gag me, and one time I threw up cause of it. 

But ever since then, when I take the first hit of the day, I will IMMEDIATELY have to throw up, and I will throw up a lot, to the point of stomach acid. In a weird sick way, I loved the relief feeling once the puking was over, so it never stopped me from using. 

Sometimes (usually if ive already smoked that day) I won't puke at all, and I'll be fine. Then sometimes I'll be nodding out and I start to get this feeling, and I can recognize it every time now. I start to feel very very hot, and start sweating and I feel light headed and very disassociated, and it builds up for a few minutes until I begin violently puking until my stomach is empty, and then I'm perfectly fine, back to nodding out and enjoying my high. 

It sucks when I spend the last of my money on H, so I'm on an empty stomach and the hits make me violently dry heave, which is very painful. 

Does anybody know what's going on? Or if this is normal? 


Edit: the only reason this concerns me is because the pattern of vomiting is starting to cause me to lose a lot of weight and become malnourished. ",1526230894.0

Thankfully I’m alive, but I want to know if what I experienced was an overdose or am I trippen?","Before I begin, I don’t need anyone adding any negative comments because I already knew the risks I took before hand but I’m just trying to understand exactly what happened. 


Connect said he has “China White” and right off the bat I’m skeptical, especially since he’s charging much more. After trying the product, I’m under the impression that it’s powdered fentanyl because the intensity feels like its medical grade and I live on the west coast (Cali). First I smoked it on foil and it tasted exactly like the OG Oxy’s 80mg. After getting a feel for how potent this stuff is, I decided to try IVing it. 


On my 2nd shot of the day, I made sure to only try about half of the shot to see if it was too much and of course I thought it wasn’t. I only injected 75% of it and woke up on the floor with imprints on my skin from other objects on the floor. I was out for about 20 minutes when I finally came to. I’m not entirely sure if I overdosed but I woke up without any high and with some ld the dope leftover. I would like everyone’s opinion if I had a close call or if I am overthing it!


Since this stuff has a short half life, is potent af, tastes like oxy and more, it’s safe to assume it’s fentanyl. This person won’t admit that and says it’s China, as he sells it for 10 bucks a point. I’m used to paying 50 a G of some bomb black tar. I keep hearing that fentanyl is cheaper than heroin, if that’s the case then how much is he paying or picking this stuff up for ? ",1526212500.0

No sense in buying dope on pay day, the day before the job interview unless it can enhance my job interviewing abilities. Even then, I have my subs and they'll keep me more than well through the experience and task. If anything, I may need to taper down from the current 3mg to 0mg in preparation for a piss based drug test.

Last two times I did a drug test for a job, I smoked good weed the days prior and drank enough water to nearly piss clear. Once I drank an energy drink to add color back to the piss, I was in the clear for the urine test.

The most recent drug test was under different circumstances, let's just say the person who administered the test didn't know that it was a red flag to have clear urine. It was my own piss but it was too clear by professional standards.

If I don't get the job, I won't need to get a drug screening and even if I do get the job, I may not have to submit for a screening immediately. What do state and city angencies do, if you are offered work in a library, or do IT support in some random civil service agency... \*\*How many panels are on the drug test?\*\*

In short, I know a 5 panel test will not screen for buprenorphine, nor will a 10 panel. 11 panels and up on the other hand... will. Now of course if I was seeking a job in law enforcement, there would a be higher expectation of a more rigurous test.

In short, I don't thing there's any way to be certain.

Regardless, if I get the job I embark on a new chapter of my life. One which likely involves waking up at 5 fucking AM to commute but one which also allows me to command a pay rate that is multiples better than my current one. I could imaine it now... my uncle hounding me about geting a wife and me having every right to say fuck off. Maybe eventually accrue that ""fuck you"" money that John Goodman talks about... but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Basics, basics, basics..... My brother once called me to eat at a diner with him. It took a coupel of weeks to arrange it on a day when we both were free. I thought he was going to talk about Trek and Star Wars with me. I thought that I was going to be able to tell him about an amazing literay universe that I stumbled upon. I thought it was going to be a bonding experience, a long overdue one.

Instead, it was my brother telling me that I'll never finish college.. to not bother considering that further, telling me that I need to find a real job, that I should be more like him because he has a wife and she was a great help when mother passed on. Motherfucker, your broad \(with all due respect to present company of women\) is not a fucking shoulder to cry on.. she is not your crutch. Many unlucky men have discovered this through a rude awakening.

Anyway, he went on to say ""you need to look forward to a three hour commute."" What does he mean? He's strongly suggesting that I apply for a job in a neighboring state where public transportation options are available but a pain in an ass to say the least. Maybe if I had a car, but I really never wanted one too badly.

Bottom line, he went as far as suggesting an Aamazon job that looked like it was right up my alley.. except Amazon loves borrowing your life blood. Twelve hour shifts with the expectation you'll pick up over time as they need you to. The higher paying Amazon job did not look like a job which would enable me to have free time.... I do work on other projects, I do have aspirations that my other work will become more successful.

Rewind, the day I met up with my brother. It was a Sunday afternoon around 1PM. I had just spent the night taking key hits from the supply of dope that was supposed to be saved for Sunday. I still had something left to take the edge off in the morning before meeting my brother but by the time I was in the middle of eating my waffles I was getting the yawns. We all know, once the yawns start \-\- it's over. Well, not completely but it is the begining of the end.

So I'm falling into this psychologically vulnerable state and being pressed, ""what do you do, who do you hang out with on your free time?"" Do you think I'm going to mention, ""oh, I hang out with Clifford a lot, smoke pot, watch movies, jerk around on the internet... maybe work on a little code and blogging. Somtimes I put lots of time into writting at r/opi..."" I most certainly did not reference my time with Clifford. That mofo is a red flag and rightfully so.

He also went on to say that my obsession with my turtles was fucking weird. Alright, that's it.. fuck off. Those are my fucking brats and they're good kids, except when they're being asshole escape artists and even then that's at their own peril. It was a year later he did get word about my dope slinging and attempted to stage an intervention that failed because I cried foul about the informant and said shit like ""he literally does crack."" Went for broke, played my cards and reflected as I continued to use therafter.

I think I'll give this getting clean thing a chance even if I don't get the job.. then again I do imagine that, if I didn't get the job, I would spend some money on dope. Even then, I'll play it up. I can ensure that Cliff is not my double\-middle if I did decice to cop after the interview. Still, I can get subs.. subs work to keep me maintained and if I really need to be able to take subs while takign a drug test, my best hope and best bet is to get them leigimately from a real doctor. Then, even if a drug test screens for bupe, I'll be in the clear.

So one way this palys out, I'll see a doctor, get subs... tell Cliff I'm clean or use teh subs to get free pills from Cliff. No wait, no.... he'll know I'm sitting on an ""unlimited"" supply..... that'll just open me up to bullshit again. Otherwise, I keep takign un\-prescribed subs while hoping they don't come up in a pre\-employment drug screening and I continue to attempt my own self\-recovery plan.

\*\*Point is...\*\* If I get the though the interview, I'll have an easy track to a decent job that is not in the private sector. As the guy in Ghostbusters once said, ""in the private sector, they expect results.""

Now back back to  rambles.

I'm a MULTI-TIME world champion LOSER to the false fart.  

Vivid memories of the sharts that should have been that still linger in my mind:  (the farts that actually turned out to be sharts, I have been prevale during my years of being an addict.  The number of sharts opiate withdrawals have caused is completely ASSinine.  

Whenever I would feel the desire to release a freedom fart of happiness during detox, I would be greeted by the vengeful and cruel mistress known as **False Fart Prophet.** She only  shows up to hand out punishment.  The punishment is usually of the runny, warm, rankness, all going down your leg variety.  She would always say ""There has to be some kind of payment for the euphoria we provide.""

In my dreams there's a world full of only safe farts, and no more defication defeats.  But then the fairy tale ends, my eyes adjust to the light, then the rumble in my stomach brings me back to reality 

I wonder, is this finally a rumble from a faithful fart or another unwanted shart?
  
As you ponder your options, the lingering smells of past defeats are reminders of what's at stake...

About a month ago I relapsed and snorted a little over a point of heroin, felt subtle effects but thought mostly placebo and how shitty this dope was.

Well tonight I took 40 mg of oxycodone with 50 mg promethazine about 2 hours ago and smoked 1-2grams of weed. And I barely feel it. I just feel slight nausea and dry mouth but no where close to a nod (where I want to be!!)

I might take 80 mg tommorow but having a year off and two occasions where I used there is no way I can have any tolerance, maybe the slightest. 

And I remember when I first started using 15-20 mg of oxycodone got me nodding extremely hard. It was so blissful. Now I am taking 40 mg with no tolerance and not even feeling positive effects from the high other than light sedation. ",1526194670.0

He took around 25mg heroine iv (it was literally pharmaceutical heroine, so no way it was laced with anything like fentanyl). It was his first time of intravenous application and apparently was too much. He lost conciousness 5 minutes after application and stopped breathing. Didn't have naloxone, but had a bag valve mask so I managed to ventilate him for 10 minutes manually until paramedics and a doctor arrived and administered naloxone to which he immediately regained conciousness. The cops came too but fortunately in my country drugs are not that criminalised, so even if they chose to prosecute him, it will just be a fine and nothing that will appear on his record. 
We are now at the emergency room and he is concious and breathes sufficiently and spontaneously. 
Noe they are thinking about keeping him for 24 hours, but he has an important appointment tomorrow, so do you think it would be safe for him to leave in 2-3 hours against medical advice if his breathing stays sufficient?
I would be in the same appartment as him but not in the same room.
Thanks for any advice, would highlx appreciate it!
Sorry for any incoherences, it's 3am where I live, disn't sleep yet and am still a bit shook up about the whole thing, I couldn't breathe for him sufficiently the first 30-60 seconds, he started to turn blue and I really thought my best friend was dying there..

The town he lives in is sort of a low income area, it's not an area you really want to look at someone the wrong way in. Anyway, I went to cop there today and before I meet up with him I normally make a lap around the block. This is where I make my mistake. While doing my laps I saw two cops cars driving around. At one point I couldn't get past one of them and actually waved to him as he passed smiling. After passing once I then passed one of them again shortly after down the road. No big deal I guess. Maybe they think I live around the area and i'm just going home. So I finally meet up with my dude and we quickly do the exchange from the car on a neighborhood street, nothing to out in the open. We finish the exchange and I kid you not seconds after the same cop shows up around the corner. I'm at a stop sign so he waves me on to go in front of him (currently shitting my pants, I now have the goods on me) I turn and he follows me the same way. I pull up to the next stop sign, turn, and book it the hell out of there. After running into the same cop for a third time I honestly thought he would of stopped me asking why I have been driving around in circles. Then again i'm not a very shady looking person, but I'm sure they know white kids come to cop there. I am slightly afraid to go back. I wonder if I am now on their radar.",1526148355.0

I had written a couple significant paragraphs going into a thank you for all of those who have helped keep me alive and disease free through the various needle exchanges in the number of cities I have lived in within the United States. 

I have been a chronic pain paitient for the better part of last decade, so my insurance has covered the vast majority of my opiate habit. The only things I would have to pay for were things like LSD, E \(when I could find quality stuff, and for whatever reason it's always come from the gay scene through friends I worked with\), Ketamine, DMT but that is just about all that I've been into other than opiates, benzos and Adderall \(that I rarely take, strictly for safety reasons for long motorcycle or car trips\) which I was scripted for all three. My opiates were cut off and my benzos were dramatically reduced, but I still have my Adderall script as has happened to most chronic pain paitients in the United States. I got clean for almost a year through a damn near cold turkey method. And as I have heard others say, each and every time you go through that tramatic experience, a little \(or not so little\) part of your soul disappears. I will never do that again. After being so proud of myself for getting clean, I had to go through major oral surgery from a combination of not taking care of my teeth in general, and the damage the pills did to my teeth, I had to have major work done. This was incredibly extensive and painful and led back to using opiates, except this time I found heroin. And I was quite disappointed that it didn't even hold a candle to the Opana I was used to taking for years. 

Anyway, here is the question.....

I can no longer find veins on my feet, arms or hands. I know that I've seen a diagram on here before that identified the best places to inject, could someone link me to this? Or list some strategies or helping you veins come to the surface? Also could someone describe the proper technique for shooting in the neck. I'm probably leaving out some questions. Feel free to add anything I may have left out, or any criticisms of my methods. I am planning on taking Ibogaine within the next couple months with a Flood dose and then do booster dose whenever I feel the cravings coming on. I really want to losen the grip of the monkey on my back. Any advise would be appreciated. I am tired of getting high, aside from psychedelics which I see as beneficial to my mental health as long as I keep it's use within reason.

I DO NOT ADVISE ANY OF YOU TO DO ANYTHING I EVER POST. I HAVE BEEN FOOLISH FOR MOST OF MY LIFE. BEING FOOLISH IS NO EXCUSE.
DO NOT GET HIGH OR DRUNK AND DRIVE. DON'T BE THAT FUCKFACE.

This is the truth and these are my...
# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................


""She's falling out!"" I hear as I'm jolted awake. I couldn't process what the fuck was happening. My mind was too hazy, my tongue had cracks in it and I had only been asleep for three out of 120 hours. 

None of that mattered when a cold, blue and lifeless body was carried and set down less than a foot away. I jumped up, internally melting and immediately began shaking as I ask what happened.

""She's falling out, oh my God!"" A man who nearly fucked me over said.

Well, fuck. I could've guessed that. 

""She did the bag dude."" He said as I sprinted to get ice trays and water, dialing 911.

""911, what's your emergency"" 
Those dreaded fucking words. I hate them. I hate, hate calling police. This time I had no choice.

""This girl. I don't fucking know. She's dying. She did heroin. Other than that I have no fucking clue. Get the fuck here or she's gonna die."" I said as I ripped her shirt off and threw ice on her already cold body. 

More casual bullshit chitchat from the receiving end continues, damn near boring the girl to death before the dope that was far too strong could.

The dumbfuck she was doing it with, the man who nearly fucked me over AND helped kill that poor girl, said as I was on the phone with the police, ""Dude! Hide this shit in your fucking car or we're fucked!"" 

""Send help."" I shouted to my phone as it layed on the floor by the now purple, topless, lifeless body. Then I hung it up.

I told the man to give her CPR. I ran to wake up the owner of the house, my best friend and told him there wasn't time to explain. 

""Drugs! Now! Hurry the fuck up dude!"" 

He darted to I'm not sure how many parts of the house. 
It didn't take any more than 3 minutes and I was given a box full of methamphetamine, heroin, marijuana, pain killers, straws, baggies, scales. The whole kit.

I grabbed the box, wrapped it in my sweater and casually as fucking possible walked to my car and threw it all in the very back. Hidden under a tent and a bag of charcoal.

I get back to the house and Dumbass isn't giving her CPR, he's trying to do a shot by a dead girl. I wouldn't believe it had I not seen it.

""Oh my fucking God dude what the fuck? Get the fuck out of here or get the fuck away."" And he did. He disappeared into the bathroom as I beat the fuck out of that girl's chest.

Adrenaline isn't the word. The methamphetamine that I'd been doing wished it could be that strong. 

""Police Department!"" 
And there they were, hovering over me as I pound on a nearly naked dead woman.

""Thank Fuck."" I say and I'm instructed to go outside.

I was placed in handcuffs, for reasons I still don't know. I was treated less than a human for doing nothing wrong as the girl was taken away to the hospital.

""You know you fucked up. That girl could die. Paramedics gave her 4 doses of Narcan on your buddies floor..."" Officer WhoGivesAFuck says to me, a look of disgust in his eyes, ""dispatch heard someone on the phone while you were on it telling you to put stuff in a car, which one?""

""I have no idea what you're talking about."" I say, as I'm cuffed with 5 other people, besides my best friend, on his front lawn.

""Well, an officer is speaking to the home owner right now and if anything is in this house you're both being charged""

Fuck.

I began dry heaving. Hyperventilating. Practically zero sleep in 5 days paired with someone dead and now police will do that. I'm uncuffed.

""I need a drink."" I tell Officer IHopeYouFuckingDie.

""Tough shit kid."" He smirks as he says this.

I turn on the garden hose and start drinking. My tongue thanks me. My heart still wants to just fucking quit.

They laugh their asses off. Making flophouse and junkie jokes.

""Suck a fucking dick."" I say as I spray one cops leg after dropping the hose. On accident.

""You fucking..""

""All clear"" a cop says from inside the house, distracting Officer WhoGivesAFuck and IHopeYouFuckingDie.

Thank Christ. God, I know you're real. Thank you for looking out for us. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

They push me more on who said what on the phone, separating us all for a game of ""Whose A Bitch?"". 

I'm told how lucky we are because they can't search vehicles for whatever reason that I fucking am so goddamn glad for. We are ignored when asking if the girl is okay. They don't give a shit.

As quick as they arrived, they are gone. Warning us all that we will see them again because they'll be staying close, randomly.

I give the keys to my car directly to Dumbass and tell him to get his shit. He does and leaves in his own car. I am pretty sure he had a syringe up his ass at this point and I hope the cap is off. 

Fast forward less than an hour, my friends phone is ringing and ringing. 

The girl is alive. She wants a ride from the hospital.

""You know what the fuck you did?"" He screams. ""I ain't fucking picking you up. There's no goddamn needles in my fucking house and you fucking know that! I'm glad you're ok but honestly you can fuck yourself now.""

I feel bad for her and so does he. Our nerves are fucking shot.

Moral of the story:

If you do heroin. Fucking be safe. Her dealer told her to do less than half of what she normally does. This was China White. She didn't give a fuck and she nearly died and a shit storm nearly occurred.

Should I be CWE them if I am using them daily for 3-4 weeks? I usually eat 6-9 pills a day (they're the 10mg/325 acetametphine) Is it needed to CWE at this level? I usually pop 5 around 10am, then I pop 3 around 4pm, then 1 or 2 a couple hours before bed around 9pm..Never more than 5 at a time though..

And if i was to go big one day and take all 8/9 at a time- would I need to CWE? Or as long as i stay under 10 pills in 24hrs am I good? 

I have friends who will take 8-10 pills at once, and up to 16-20 a day. But I know that can't be good for the liver.

Thanks for any advice! trying to save my liver past the age of 27!

They put me on suboxone and have been tapering me off of it. Today I took my last dose, 1mg. Going 18+ hours without heroin (before I started on suboxone) was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, ever. Waking up at 3am because of the muscle pain and anxiety, and having to sit in my dark room for the next five hours until the rehab opened was so miserable. Like I physically cringe and shudder remembering how awful I felt. I could have found some extra h laying around my room or smoked some missed tar on my foils to make the pain go away, but I stuck it out! I did it! And now I’ve been clean off of heroin for 10 whole days!

The nurses at my rehab are so sweet and kind, I’m genuinely going to miss seeing them everyday. But I hope I never have to see them again (at least in the same context and setting). I still think about using heroin, for some reason I miss the secrets, the isolation, and the thrill of doing something “bad”. I miss my friends that I would smoke with and the general lifestyle. But I do not miss the stress and anxiety that I felt when I didn’t have enough or couldn’t get any before withdrawals kicked in. I don’t miss smoking so much I can’t stop throwing up and then dry heaving because nothing is left in my stomach. I don’t miss nodding out so bad I almost wreck my car. And I definitely don’t miss withdrawals. I don’t know if my pre-existing health conditions make withdrawals worse for me personally, but the thought of experiencing that ever again is possibly my biggest fear.

# My Druggie Confessionals

......................................................................................


""Hey, come here.."" She whispered to me, while we waited in her doctors office, ""do you feel ok?"" 

I replied to her that I did and asked why she was asking. She smiled and winked, saying, ""Do you wanna feel good? Like really, really good?"" 

Immediate erection.

My mind automatically went to Fuckyville. Population my best friend's mother and myself. Yeah, it's wrong. My best friend would've hated me, but my God I would rip this woman apart. It had been on my mind from the first time meeting her and now it's years past that. She was HOT.

""Hell yeah I do. Do you?"" I said, sightly nervous honestly, totally being a fucking dick and disregarding the fact that we both were, separately, unhappily married at the time. With a giggle she told me to wait until we got out of there. 

(Fast forward through the awkward erection hiding during a routine blood draw from her doctor...)

She disappears into her bathroom when we got back to her house. I had skipped school earlier that day to hustle money and on my way out she asked if she could hitch a ride, and I'd have gave her any.

""Come back here"" echoing from the bedroom.

Holy fuck. Yessssssssssssssss. 

Sorry bro. Sorry wife. Sorry best friend's husband. I'm sticking it to her and I only have that amount of fucks to give.

A needle.

Not what I was expecting. That was the first time I've ever seen one. 
A bottle of 8mg Dilaudid and my topless best friend's mother were #2 and #3 in my vision.

""Yeah, I don't know..."" I said, now peering at her massive titties. 

""It'll be ok."" She says as she gazes back at me from the mirror.

She was surprised that I knew how to do it all already. I hold of bevy of information that is useless to a lot of normal people.

Pill bottle, crush the Dilly in the lid, get a cotton, load syringe with water, crush it, squirt water on the powder, throw in cotton, draw from it.. ruin your life. Fuck tying off. My veins have been unraped thus far.

I just wanted to fuck. My life sucks enough.

""Promise me you won't say anything to X""  she said to me, nervously.

Yeah lady, I'm not gonna. I planned on seeing how deep the rabbit hole went and he wouldn't like that shit either.

""My veins are massive, nearly the size of those knockers"" I tried to add humor to the situation. Yeah, smooth dumbass. 

She laughed. I laughed, then cried inside.

Aaaaaaand thereeeee it issssss.

Ruuuuuuuuuuusssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Ho Lee Phuk.

There really is a fucking invisible blanket. Opiheads were right. 

Horrible, horrible choice. I didn't honestly know this until I finally decided to try to quit opiates a year later.

Withdrawals sent me to the hospital, my wife at the time had no idea why I was so sick. She still to this day doesn't know I would hang out with my best friend, his mom and a few of my other lackeys and snort so much powder that it rivaled a ski resort.

When I quit I spent two entire weeks passing out upon standing, unable to eat or drink nearly anything, and my side hurt so bad I would cry myself asleep.

The doctor told me I have Hep C as my blood test came back. I should be hospitalized because it's so swollen and my blood is so toxic. I went home.

I bawled. I had only used a needle one time. Apparently that shit doesn't matter. Karma came to collect. I hated that needle and I hated that woman. I hated myself.

I still tear up recalling all of this. My worst decision in my life.

I never went back to that needle and I never went back to that house. The last time I saw my friends mom was because I was a pallbearer at her funeral. She overdosed in that same bathroom a week after I was told I was sick.

I don't have the heart to tell him what I've did. We barely speak anymore and it's because I'm so embarrassed.

Don't. Do. This. Shit.

I'm still on opiates and any drug available for that matter. My wife from this story is my ex-wife. 
My best friend from the story is bouncing to and fro from a methamphetamine addiction. He had been before his mother passed. 

I've never touched a needle since and no one I know knows of any of this.

Edit: I didn't share a needle. She told me it was new. Obviously it wasn't. It was out of the packaging and she had everything set up already as she called my name. She gave me an old one she used apparently.

Don't do it new in the packaging or not. It's honestly overrated compared to what you're doing and possibly losing.",1526080456.0

So I recently moved to a new state and have been making good money at the job I'm at installing flooring. I have a really good friend who lives in the state I'm coming from. I have been mostly clean since I came up here except for the occasional sac of h,and recently broke up with my girlfriend who I am living with. I am moving out into a different plavs at the end of the month

At my work I have been given the opportunity to take on my own crew and make more money than before. So I go ahead and invite this friend up here to come live with me and get clean and even work with me. He has had no work experience and is 20 Years old. Also he has nothing going for him where he's at. Only gets high every day and says he wants to be clean. So I did what I thought was right and invite him up here to get him clean and I offered to pay for his rent for 2 or 3 weeks till he gets clean and feeling better, pay for the gas up here, feed him and make sure he's got a bed and shit, and whatever he may need. Even offered to get him suboxone for the withdrawls to make it easier.

Now to me that's a very rare offer. Someone saying I will help you get clean and get away from all the negative bullshit and people around you and help you out with future opportunities. He seems like he wants to but somethings maybe holding him back? He says oh I want to get clean but I feel like if that was true why wouldn't you say yes to this. It wouldn't be long term either maybe a year and a half until I move back to my old state.

What would you guys do? This is a really good friend of mine that I truly want to help out and get him back on track. I see a lot of potential in him that he is not using and the people around him give no fucks if he's not doing shit with his life. I get its a big change but the only way I actually got clean was getting away from everyone. ",1526079006.0

I’ve been using oxy for a year or so now, on and off. Probably 20 times in the past year. I usually take 30mg orally, highest dose I’ve had is 60mg.  I usually enjoy it, especially after a meth binge. When you haven’t slept in days, hardly eaten... Makes the oxy hit me like a tonne of bricks! 


Once every few times though, it’s extremely unpleasant. Despite being my normal 30mg dose I usually enjoy. 


Basically, when it doesn’t go to plan, I get no euphoria at all. The first sign of them taking effect is getting extremely hot, sweaty, shaky, and nauseous. This will last 5 mins until I vomit. Then I’ll feel miserable for a while, then I’ll again get hot, sweaty, shaky and nauseous. This cycle lasts a couple hours usually, followed by an overall shitty sedated opiate high lacking all the positive elements. Quick bout of nausea every hour or two. The whole time I’m left angrily wishing they’d wear off. 


Does anybody know what causes this to happen? 4/5 times I love it! And it’s the same dose so I don’t understand why 1 out of those 5 times is so different. I have some now that I want to take, but getting hyped for an opi buzz then feeling like trash sucks, so I want to know how to eliminate this possibility. ",1526077118.0

I also now use opiates for severe pain that I have in my back and shoulder. But what started me on my path down using basically anything to make me feel different started with benzos. So I'm sorry if this story upsets any of y'all who wanted to hear about my opiate addiction. But I'm sure many of you can relate to me in someway because doctor's truly are the real drug dealers nowadays.

But January of last year I was admitted into my local ER thinking I was dying. I couldn't feel my legs, arms, face, etc and my heart was literally beating so fast and hard that I was shaking from the beat if my heart. They thought I was bullshitting and just made me wait in the waiting room forever until my girlfriend told the nurse that she legit though I was dying like 3 separate times. They finally brought me back and saw my HR was 196 bpm so they instantly brought me to a room and had me IV'd in like no time. They pumped some shit into my body that stopped my heart and then would restart it but it didn't work so they wanted to do it again with no prevail. They we're giving injections of Ativan every 30 minutes on the dot and had me on all sorts if drips. Eventually when my heart rate got down to 140 without any spikes they moved me to the cardiac Care unit. Still getting Ativan every 30 minutes. Even while I was already asleep because I checked the hospital records and when I was sleeping they were ringing in Ativan injections to give to me. I'll tell you what I was taking a trip on the Van. But the next morning my heart rate was back to normal but they Dr. Wrote me a script for 270 1mg kpins to take 2-3 times a day to stay calm so my heart wouldn't freak out again. That's a lot of benzos to fucking prescribe someone and he didn't have it set as refills I had all of them in one big bottle but I was using them responsibly until my body started needing more. Eventually my doctor prescribed me 2mg kpins 2-3 times a day as needed. Then I told him I couldn't get anything done because I wanted to be in bed all day so he switch my script to 0.5 Ativan 2 times a day. And I'll talk you what I flew through that shit like it was candy. He said he'd try me on Xanax instead and started me off with 120 1mg footballs, then I told him my anxiety was awful whenever i didn't take one. So he bumped me up to 120 2mg bars.Eventually he finally sent me to see a real psychiatrist and she gave me 120 .5mg xanax which was a major drop in my dose and she was like well yeah your body is addicted to them and that's when it first hit me. Even if you think your taking shit for medical reasons you will convince yourself you're fine but I was taking 12mg of Xanax a day which no person should have to take. Fuck my hospital. And thank you for my psychiatrist who helped me detox and helps me take shit responsibly..",1526069499.0

To keep it (kinda) short, I had been going through withdrawals for a couple days and had gotten a text yesterday a little after noon that the dboi had some bupes, so he hooked me up with 5 for a fairly good price and of course I took a quarter of one to get those aches away.

Here’s where the story part comes, so I woke up this morning and looked at my stash and realized I did 2 8mg bupes last night, probably reason being I had been on a bar and a half before I got the bupes even in hand. 

QUESTIONS 
1: How long does buprenorphine stay active in your system?
2: Will I suffer bad withdrawals once they (bupes) wear off? (Don’t have a high tolerance to H, or buprenorphine either. Never have done heroin only oxys and hydros for years but HAVE done bupes before) 
3: Since these don’t have Naloxone will it be any different?

Many of you that complain of paranoia from sativa would probably enjoy an indica body high","I’ve seen a lot of posts talking about how weed isn’t the cure all that people claim....I agree.

However, one of the main arguments I see used is that it makes people paranoid or antsy.  I would guess 90% of this is what your smoking.  A nice indica strain/edible will really relax your body.  It obviously won’t breakthrough your pain like an oxy quite would...but it will definitely
Help with relief, sleep, and just relaxing. 

The problem really is since access to medical marijuana is still very limited in the US most people resort to street weed which in my experience is usually going to be a sativa or hybrid of some sort.

I’m an everyday smoker and I really notice a huge difference when I’m in medical states and am able to use my card to pick the strain I want.  You know what to expect and a lot of the indices provide an extremely relaxing body high. 

Either way I believe that medical marijuana will soon be readily available.  In the mean time I really hope doctors stop cutting people’s scripts just to put less opioids on the street...their only adding to this epidemic I have seen ravish my community/state and furthermore country.

That’s all I think about all day of everyday it’s to point where I am going to do it almost. I have only done this drug a handful of times. I don’t know where or who to get it from I’m South of city that has it and I am good at cold copping since I’m not afraid to go in the hood get what I want. I love K8 k4 and k2 I don’t like morphine or roxys I love to mix my methadone with Xanax (I know it will kill me but so won’t everything else ) but I haven’t been able to find them I just wish this craving of wanting to get high would leave I mean it’s all I can do to fight off the Urge.  I just Recently was introduced to eco heroin and I was on my mmt program when I tried it so it honestly did nothing for me. If I don’t get the urge to stop I’m afraid that I’m going to use and i probably won’t make it back from this run. I have the best wife and a super cool son that are my world I would lose them if I even got high just once she has had enough  and I don’t blame her plus I don’t want my son to see me or be raised in or around a father that’s either to sick to play or to fucked up to walk I was raised in a household like this where drugs and booze were a way of life sorry to ramble but if I didn’t tell someone it was going to kill me ,1526045373.0

Sort of slipped up a bit last night. Not exactly a relapse as such, more just me being a bit of a dickhead. I found an old, well, basically a small metal dish made specifically to cook shots that I got with some needle kits I ordered way back when I thought I wanted to shoot heroin (turned out I didn't, luckily, I'm way too much of a pussy lol). Anyway there was a light dusting of that tan brown powder you get here in the UK. Spent last night trying to smoke it. There was so little that I didn't really feel any effect, and I took my buprenorphine dose this morning with no ill effects so I'm not too concerned.

But that fucking smell. I can still smell it on me even though I've washed my hands. It reminds me of the short period of time when I was using heroin, when that smell was the only thing I could smell. It's hard to describe. I've heard people describe the brown heroin as vinegary and I can understand that I guess but I'd say it's more of a sickly sweet smell. Maybe it's not even the heroin but something else. I've quit smoking cigarettes too, and I guess you could compare it to that (not the smell but the sensation of association). But cigarettes smell awful to me now even if they do smell somewhat tempting, this heroin smell is just nice...

I’m on home confinement for bail on a felony case for drug distribution (xanax)

So my officer called to come in today to talk about some violations (she said my gps found me at the Liqour store and dominos pizza
And have been taking longer routes home from work) 

I also got a drug test, which was an instant one (never got an instant one before)
 but they are also sending it out for gc/ms (which is what they always do) 

So I’ve been drinking, taking the research chemicals etizolam and Clonazolam (benzos) 
And I’ve also been using heroin.  

It’s been a few days since I drank, so I think I’ll be good passing the ETG test. 
I’m very worried if this test will pick up the research chemicals. 

I’m also worried about the heroin, but I have a prescription for codeine so I might be able to get away with using that as a reason for their being morphine in my system. 
But If the heroin had any fentanyl in it then I have no excuse demon for that :( 

The only thing I failed for on the instant test was opiates.

I didn't want that either though . i'm not sure what I wanted. these last few days were the reward. did she get infected these past months ? i know junkie scum germs  can be hella contagious and devour friend groups. was the front really the antibiotic army that rose her faith in victory? all i know is she has been completely different with everyone since the front. seems ridiculous but she just needed some kindness. a restoration potion.  this game -these people- wear you down. i got more out of the front than her. i needed reminded too. the scratch off gift was nice -it didn't hit the gratitude in me. it should have. i just needed the right puzzle piece to combine it with. luckily i answered her call - i made the right choice. that stranger helped me and everyone around her. he had handed it to me with out looking up as we walked passed each other. he didn't wait for a thank you and mine was mumbled any how out of the surprise confusion. so i wish you all to bump in to a lottery ticket. for whoever may need it",1526023202.0

So, let's take a vote.  Up vote if you agree with me that we are NOT BAD PEOPLE and down vote if you disagree and think that we ARE BAD PEOPLE.  Remember that there are bad apples everywhere, so vote based on the general opiate population that you know and not a couple bad guys.  Thanks for your time, Metro.",1525998158.0

Here the only thing I can find is H, and I find it a bit scary.

Now, please correct me if im wrong, but to my knowledge the pills that exist are Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Percocet, Norco and Morphine. Whenever I try to google image one of these suckers I end up seeing a picture of what I thought was some other painkiller. What color should each pill usually be? What is usually written on it?

So, I guess my questions are:

* Is Percocet the same thing is Oxycodone? (i think oxy is the main ingredient in it?)
* Is Oxycodone the same as Oxycontin?
* Which one should would be my best choice if I were to indulge in such a risky (addiction-wise) substance?

Long time lurker who will occasionally chime in on posts.  I bought a beautiful apartment this past August and after gut remodeling it, my girlfriend and I finally moved in together.

Going from living with the guys for 7 years made this a bit of a culture shock and I haven't had much freedom to use and the like - which landed me on bupe maintenance (from which I skipped up a few times, but the purpose of the maintainance was to keep from going down hill while starting my new life with my last.)

ANYWAYS.  My girlfriend's coybtey made the world cup, and she will be traveling to Russia to see them play against Denmark - for a trip that will all in be about a week.  I was planning on taking a few vacation days away from my job to enjoy the feeling of having the apartment to myself, have a good ole fashion ""relapse"" (if you can even call it that given my use history), and just chill out and watch the world cup for a few days.

I have been working on my rainy day stash (mostly dope and some benzos at this point in time) but wanted to venture out to grab some of my old favorite pharms - along with some others I haven't tried, opportunisticially between now and world cup time so I have myself a good ole fashion smorgasbord to choose from once my week of freedom hits...

Quick note to the mods I AM NOT trying to source here, simply get the opinions of the folks around here for the goal state of my buffet.

For the week off I was hoping to include:

Items i've had or tried before:

- Some more dope (have 4 buns already) 
- 7-10 of the OP 80's for maintenance and perhaps mixing up with sodas
- 3-5 MS contin
- 10ish blues

Items I haven't tried or used before:

- 4-5 of these pandas I keep hearing so much about - even if I will have to pay the ass out for them
-5-7 dillies


About my tolerance:  currently on bupe maintaince (8-12 MG / day). Though in my experience if I do dope the next day after using subs it may take an extra bag or so to get going but it usually isn't a huge hinderence.  That said I plan to ween down in the days / week proceeding perhaps throwing some kratom in as needed.  Other than that I would typically do about a bun a day redosing throughout the day every couple hours (ish).  It is also important to note that I'll only use intranasally 

So my question to all of you is how what would you stock up on if you were me for this monumental occasion?  Is there anything for my stash that I haven't quite thought of that you may recommend?  Should I get more of one thing and less of another?  I can't imagine this happening again too many times before i put a ring on her finger so I need to make it count (though safety first). 

TLDR:  bored financial professional's gf is going to Russia world cup without me.  Need help with ideas on completing my opi buffet for my week off of freedom and debauchery.

So my old friend from the methadone clinic I knew for 2 years I hit up since that clinics doctors switched and left his clients fucked FYI. Tells me here$ a number to call. 

Doesn't tell me that like 25 people man the phone and that the number I'm callin is only one they use to get numbers down and then call back to get to you. And that they man the phone 24/7 all night. So basically a huge crew and I didn't think those even existed in central canada I've never met one.  I find usually dope here is like 200 a g for garbage and 300-350 a G for quality but hell I've had shit at 300-350 too. These charge 250 but I'm fine for that for delivery, quality and overweight as well as free bags the more you buy and refer people.  

Thought since no one responded no one would call back but by the way the run the rumber I get a call back in 10. Guys says he will be 45 minutes. And lo and behold hes here in 45 minutes. Yay delivery. Rolls up with a sandwich ziplock bag full of rolls and I just about had a heart attack lol. 

So I ask buddy for a variety bag since I do like good China white fent dope with legs ( reminded me of that certain vendor that does level 1 and x China white in potency and legs none of that hour shit). 

So I get some China white holy Clean strong and long lasting. Also get some amazing grey dope that could be minimally cut with fent but looks and feels raw and like high quality dnm purchases I've made. Also got some of the rawest definitely  straight white raw fire. Usually don't bang but had to bang this stuff.  

Also didn't realize but they do coke too so I grab a gram for 80. Holy Christmas batman this shit is amazing blow. Next time I pick up ( maybe today) I'll send a picture.

I'd assume this is common sense but the amount of people completely ignorant to this lethal combination is just ridiculous. Me and my dude pick up some caps, Midwest is flooded with fent so 9 times out of 10 we get fent caps with the rare exception that some real dope comes through and it's generally underwhelming because of the fent  we're used too. 

We were told it was real dope, I told him I guarantee it's fent, they were pure white 3/4  filled caps which are almost always fent. We stop by another buddys, he throws us both a couple bars. I immediately tell dumbass to save those bars for when you're in WD. These are potent you don't need to waste them this evening. He kind of blows me off but doesn't take any while he's with me. We leave, I drop him off and go home. Less than an hour later I'm getting a call from his frantic brother that he's unresponsive, not breathing. I tell him call 911 and put everything illegal away, thankfully he had already done both. 

They ended up narcaning him twice I guess and he came too, he said he took not one but two of the fucking bars when he got home after snorting more dope. The paramedics said he's lucky to be alive because if his brother hadn't happened to walk in and see what he was doing instead of just leaving like he'd planned dude would be a goner for sure  

So please, everyone, save the benzos for another time especially when using dope/fent. Please. It's not worth risking your life. I know in this particular incident  the user was very reckless but he had a decent tolerance to both fent and benzos and almost lost his life thinking he'd be okay.

I had heard about looking for roofing tar on CL on here so I looked it up in my area, found someone who was clearly selling black and sent them a text. Long story short they showed up right on time, I bought a ball and although it was a bit more pricey than I'm used to paying I was just so relieved to find something that I didn't care that much. Now I'm back home feeling much better and I just wanted to tell my story and say that if you're ever really in need, I would go for it. I think most people aren't out here trying to scam. Most are just trying to make some money and gain a potential customer.

I honestly don’t feel like these things help you thrive, merely survive. Idk if my health insurance just totally sucks or what, but the place my family medicine doctor told me to go to is just a revolving door facility of people coming in, pissing in cups, signing off on the results of their UA, and then talking to the suboxone nurse lady for like 20 minutes tops before getting a refill on the scrip and being on their merry way. And out of everyone I’ve seen in there, only 2 people looked like they were over 25. Everyone else has been my age or younger, and I can’t tell whether the people who work at this place are just like, already rendering us hopeless, or if a more dynamic form of treatment is too expensive, or if they have some bullshit quota of prescriptions to dole out, or like what. I just do not for the life of me know. It’s honestly v. upsetting. Doesn’t make me feel all that great about this supposed recovery deal. Super suspect about it all.

I was doing everything you could think of. I made so much money that i didnt even bat an eye to my use. I figured I would be able to maintain this life style of using dope all the time. But as time grew longer, my days filled with regret and despair for my use. I could have been saving money and investing every coin I made. Nothing felt right as I continued down this road. The constant paranoia of being sent to prison. The constant sadness of my wasted time as I spent my days nodding away. Spending so much of my time inside of locked bathrooms and bedrooms. I felt I had enough. I was using so much that I was beginning to lose my hair and it became raggedy. My anxiety has always been horrible, but never this horrible.


That's about the time I quit using every opioid you could find in the black market. The withdrawals were horrendous, but only lasted about a week and a half. I was still out of it every day and I had intense anxiety. So, i decided to buy 125 grams of kratom for $20 USD. I tried it once as a teenager and didn't care much for it. As soon as I took that first dose, I finally went back to being normal. I felt that blissfulness that wasnt too overpowering and allowed me to be tranquil. And if I needed to go in a stressful situation, I would take more than I usually would and feel that amazing opiate high.


My anxiety has finally been lifted. My tremors are so far gone from my life that I've finally become happy again. Simply knowing that this substance can cure my anxiety better just like any opiate did, I found the holy grail. I found the one thing in my life I could be proud to look forward to, and without the repercussions that dope would hold over me. I'm back to chipping the substance to whenever I need it. The withdrawals only make you tired and don't cause much anxiety either. There isnt that draw towards it that makes you scream for more of it like fentanyl and its cousins had. 


For any of you being taken over by opiates or opioids, trash it all and take kratom. It's made my life so much better and I can finally start achieving all that I wanted to. I've been with this community for years now and I want to help everyone else here, as well. Do it for yourself, because no one else will.


God bless, Kratom.",1525926124.0
8ibvz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8ibvz4/very_confused_about_withdrawals_help/,8,https://redd.it/8ibvz4,Jke55,Very confused about withdrawals help,"I'm extremely confused on heroin WD's and wondering if anyone else has heard of this or know anything about what's going on. 

So background is I've been using for 3 years daily with about 7 months of sobriety in there, longest being 5 months in a row. 

I know I'll get shit for this but I've only smoked dope, and at first I believed that was the reason why I never got sick, but when I got sober for 5 months I had planned with my buddy to do it together, it was both our first time cleaning up after using everyday for about a year and a half. 

So I let him stay at my place and I bought us 40 Xannies, 3 subs each, and I bought us a strip of acid for afterwards to straighten out our heads and move forward from dope. 

I get us a ball (3gs) and we enjoy our last night sitting in a hot tub bullshitting, and getting high.

Morning comes and I wake up to screaming coming from my living room, I laid there for a couple minutes trying to mentally prepare for it, but nothing. My buddy on the other hand was profusely sweating, threw up on my carpet, and when I tried giving him some xanax he became enraged accusing me of using. It became a huge argument and even though I honestly didn't use I couldn't convince him otherwise, I gave him 40 dollars and he went to use, I stayed with my plan and got sober. 

Fastforward 5months and I find out my buddy had started shooting up and died the first week he started shooting up. 

we still were hanging out all the time, he apologized for what happened, him still not understanding how I dodged the ""bullet"" when we both picked up from the same guy and I used more than him (was using a ball in 2 days compared to him using a half g or if his finances allowed him a full g every 2 days) 

Even though he was constantly using in front of me I had no desire to use, and we just hung out but after he died I picked it up again. 

My habit of out of hand quickly and started using the dark web to get fent, I thought for sure I was physically addicted, I would wake up with a sore lower back and had no energy to do anything except sleep or pickup and hold me till my next package arrived. 

I'm like a good 14 months into daily use and 10 of those months mainly using fent, I end up getting pulled over and they tell me they smell alcohol (complete lie) I pass the breathalyzer long story short they say I'm on drugs and find an old weed pipe. 

Its friday night and I'm sitting in jail unable to get out until Monday because my card is on me and no one can pay my bail. 

I pass out and wake up Saturday morning fearing the worst but surprisingly I feel better then when I wake up at home. I immediately noticed I didn't have any back pain and other then being a bit down due to sitting in jail for another couple days and maybe getting a dui, I realized wasn't sick at all, even the day after, nothing the whole time. 

I go to the arraignment on Monday and talked to the public defender, being told that from my drug test i had to take, the police painted a picture I was a junkie, but convinced the judge who wasn't going to release me, that if that was true wouldn't I have been sick? And that I came up positive due to prescribed pain medicine. 






TLDR:
Used daily for a year and a half with good friend, both only picked up from same guy, I used a ball every 2 days, compared to friend using a half g sometimes full g if he had the money every 2 days. 
We both only smoked, yet when we tried to quit and get sober, only he got deathly sick, sweating, throwing up/dry heaving. 

I quit for 5 months, relapse, and after 2 months of using start using mainly fent for 14 months daily only picking up dope if my packages were late or I didn't make them last long enough. I get arrested and sit in jail from Friday night to Monday, no withdrawals, nothing.

And yes, I do abuse it at times, I used to get high on them a lot more but stopped more recently. Until, that is, I went on a bit of a serious binge over the last few weeks, and now I'm on the maximum daily dosage (at least how it's prescribed) of 240mg to keep myself out of withdrawal.

I was talking to my therapist today and told her about this, as it has been worrying me somewhat, and she said I should consider talking to my doctor about it. I'm just worried that if I tell my doctor that I've become dependent on the meds they will assume I shouldn't take them any more, because of further addiction potential, and stop the prescription. Which is something I am very concerned about. When I'm not abusing them I do actually need them for pain relief, and I really don't want to have them taken away.

Has anyone here been in a similar situation before? What did you do? I live in the UK (is this allowed by rules? I don't know how specific I have to not be, sorry, I can edit this), where doctors are a lot more careful in general about prescribing narcotics, so that's why I'm really concerned.",1525902749.0

1). Remove pill coating - put in mouth and suck for 7-10 seconds then wipe the coating off with a paper towel 

2). Using a sharp ass knife or razor blade, half or quarter the pill

3). Place your pill bits on a generous piece of aluminum foil 

4). Turn your oven on broil and out the foil with your pill bits in the oven (preferably not top rack as this puts you in jeopardy of burning your gear). What you're looking for is a very dark brown color, that's how you know they're ready. Crisping the pills might take anywhere from 30 seconds - 5 minutes depending on the strength of your oven and how close they are to the heating elements.

5). Once you have sufficiently crisped your pills, fold the foil over and crush them flat with a rolling pin, spoon, whatever you can find. Now you should have some small plasticky lookin' wafers.

6). Find a large spoon/ladle. It can be hard to get an entire pill into a shot, so I often add about 2.5 cc's (2.5 syringe fulls) to my ladel, add my opana wafers, and then just bring it to a light boil and stir stir stir. Filter, suck, shoot!

P.S. There is almost always some pill material left over after your first shot. This is great, as it allows for sometimes up to 4 or 5 decent hits off of one pill. Opana is the crack of opiates. ",1525902727.0

I have been around the BTH game in the PNW for a couple years now and I have encountered killer stuff all the way down to shit that is completely fake. The main way I judge the quality before consumption is the strength of that gnarly vinegar smell. 

Generally, as far as looks go, the obsidian looking shiny stuff tends to be better than most. However, that isn't always the case. 

Yesterday I picked up a ball from my dgirl who always has fire. But this stuff was gooey as fuck! So gooey that I was wasting a lot at a time trying to throw it on foil until I put it in the freezer. Now this stuff is super good, but I haven't seen BTH get that viscous before. 

Is the viciousness due to the lack of cut, therefor it makes sense that it is a lot stronger than normal? And yes I understand that when this stuff gets hot it is gonna be a lot meltier, but this was above and beyond that.

I have been trapped in this stupid pattern for the last 4-6 months: I use for anywhere from 2-6 weeks, then get on sub for a few days to a week and a half, then stay sober for 2 weeks to a month, and then relapse rinse and repeat. I had one year clean from opiates in November and then relapsed, I have been trapped in this cycle ever since. 

      I have finally figured out how to make this induction period a little easier, these 24 hours (more like 12) used to just kill me; the anxiety involved in preparing and waiting for it, the self loathing because I know I've done this to myself, and just the empty feeling of starting from square one every few weeks/months is physically and mentally draining. Not to mention the physical/mental symptoms of withdrawal (acute and post). I am fairly prepared though: I have 1mg of Xanax, buying some edibles tonight, couple mgs of klonopin, 8 8mg sub pills, and a few other little WD aides. I basically knock myself out for the last 12 hours of the sub induction period, it makes this process about as painless as I have ever experienced it. There is no way to describe that pit in the bottom of your stomach when you wake up in the morning and immediately your first thought is that withdrawal is coming (or its already started), you aren't getting any dope, and you basically wont be leaving this bed or room for the next 12-16 hours. 

     Being on opiates I feel like a shark in the waters;  embrace everything head on, not afraid of anything, not worried about shit, like an apex predator. Getting off of them I feel like a little fish out of water, it feels like I have gone for the bait (dope) and got the hook stuck in my mouth. I have been reeled in and up to the shore/boat and now I am flopping around on the deck/ground: everything I do is uncomfortable, everything is scary (or at least induces massive anxiety), I have no energy, and I am usually just fighting to breathe and not give in to the temptation of using dope again because I know that is the only thing that will fix how I am feeling but ironically it will also plunge me deeper into this fucked up mess. I hope everyone out there is enjoying their high if you are still using, I only wish good things upon you: short waits, great quality, and enough quantity for a morning dose. If you are in recovery I hope that y'all are starting to settle into your bodies (not feeling like your skin is crawling), anxiety is manageable, each of life's mundane tasks cease to feel like climbing Mt Everest, and the anhedonia is starting to lift. If you are in more long term recovery then I hope that life is good and you are well on your way to becoming who you want to be!

Will I feel anything?","Happy Tuesday my wonderful r/opiates friends! I know the half life of Suboxone is fairly long... and I apologize in advance if this question has been addressed in the recent past (I’m sure it has but idk how long ago and google hasn’t helped). Oh also I have a fairly high opiate tolerance; been snorting 30mg pandas daily for about 3 years now and just recently switched to ECP about 4 months ago going through half g’s daily.

Nevertheless, this morning at 9AM I took an 8mg moon. I snorted half and dissolved the other half under my tongue. Right after the 2 lines I started sneezing about 40 times like I snorted a King Kong finger sized line of pollen. I feel as though most of what went up my nose came out in the hotel sink... 

So here are my questions for you insanely knowledgeable people. Does anyone half any idea how fast the absorption rate for suboxone is when snorted? And did the 4mg I snorted actually not work at all and only the sublingual 4mg I took actually got into my system and stuck to my receptors? Last question... Since I took the suboxone about 11 hours ago, Will I be wasting this half g of ECP if I snort it all over the course of tonight?

Flipped my shit.,"I was so embarrassed the other day because something happens completely unexpected. So sober for 3 months, had a gram a day habit before. I just got out of jail and wanted to party but really didn't have any intention of doing opiates. I buy a bottle of Henny and get a hotel room with my roommates. I'm not a heavy drinker especially not brown. I think I took maybe two shots of Henny and Coca cola. I end up deciding that I wanted to do some boy, so I got a point. (Roommates don't kno about me getting it) I decide to go take a shower to do it, so I load up. I think I ended up falling asleep standing up in the shower. I must have been in there for a long time because all of a sudden I heard loud continuous banging on the bathroom door,  my name being called. I open the door and my roommate reaches his hand in and grabs his shoes and closes the back. I blacked out at this point mentally but the bits and pieces that I do recall is everything was fine and they were going to get food across the street. It only literally been two minutes after they walked out the door, and something in my head snapped like a light switch. I all of a sudden get terrified. And I mean freaked out terrified and I swore there was somebody came into my room trying to kill me and threatened that if I didn't leave right then that we were all going to die. My whole world around me is blurry, slo-mo. (Found out my glasses came off later). Now I literally grab everything from the room that I think we need and not heavy and throw it in a plastic bag. Somehow I get my hands on a loaded .45 automatic. Lapse. Now I'm on the elevator. Lapse. Now I'm cleaning getting forced to clean up projectile vomit on the elevator. Lapse. Now I'm running up the highway with a pistol in my hand and the phone in my other hand crying to my roommates that we're all going to die. Lapse. They manage to find me and get me back to the room. lapse, sleep. When I woke up the next day I thought it was a bad dream. Until my roommate tells me that I'm a crazy fuck. According to them from the time they left the room to the time I was actually in the street waving a gun was less than 5 minutes. This has never happened before. The past 6 months I haven't even nodded out. Driving on that shit and everything perfectly fine. But I don't know dude I don't drink either. Does anybody know what might have happened?",1525815146.0

I'm lurking since a few months, but sometimes I want to answer somebody, so here's my story in short.

I get fent patches (50) since some emergency surgeries last year. Tried some drugs before, smoked weed since decades, but never tried opiates. When I was about 20 a friend once smoked heroin, and the special happiness from which he told me was a huge warning. I never touched it cause I knew I would like it too much.

There were times in hospital when I didn't want to live anymore, so I started thinking of ways to kill myself should I ever get in this situation again. Boom... heroin! And it's of course better to have something in the house said my brain, and I nearly bought something. But it would be too easy to try it, I have a ""port"", a subdermal steady access to a vein (sorry, I don't know the english word). So, no heroin in the house. Weed is ok too.

I don't know if I still have pain, but when I forget a new patch my mood gets worse every minute. I also have morphine tablets and oxy, sometimes I take an oxy, only 10mg, because I like the feeling. It's a lot warmer than the fent, this only makes me calm and more tired. But, Weed is ok too.

I really appreciate this sub and his members.

Everyone has said to purchase online (as opposed to head shops, like I have in the past) — without providing actual websites, can anyone advise what I should be looking to purchase? And any guidance on how best to dose? Is there any way to measure dosages without having to buy a scale (like, perhaps, with a scooper — one that you would find in a package of protein powder)?

I've been clean for around a month, until today. If you recall from my previous posts I mentioned that my mother said she had a stash of Percocet when my sister used up her script and was waiting for a refill. I wasn't able to find said stash.



Until today. I just flew back home last night. It was in her underwear drawer, the one place I refused to look, because eww, gross. While on the plane I actually assumed it was probably there because she knew I wouldn't look there.



Two pill bottles, one with maybe 13 5/325 Percocet and the other with probably 18 5/325 Vicodin. So I relapsed, I took 3 of the percs and 2 of the vics with 2 pint glasses of white grapefruit juice. Damn it felt nice, still feeling it a little now. Started reading ""House of Leaves""- weird fucking book, even harder to read when you're softly nodding in and out.



My tolerance surprised me, even after a month of sobriety I still felt like I probably could have taken twice as much in order to get where I really wanted to be. Of course I can't take any more, because it would be obvious that someone has been digging into her rainy day stash. I'm home for another 2 weeks, knowing that there are pills here that I can't take. 



It's a fucking bummer but it's probably for the best. She also just refilled her script for Ambien, so I snagged one of them because I'm bored. Damn I'm a shitty human being.

I had a friend tell me a couple of months ago who swears up and down, in the southern USA, that she was with her Lady but they were coming back pos for fent.

So I have been buying them from walmart. 

Lately though it seems they’re kind of tightening up on things. Last time I went to the one that always sells sharps to me they asked for my “insulin card”. I just claimed that I’ve shown it to several staff members at this location before, I come here often etc etc so the pharmacist sold it to me but said in the future I need to bring it every time. At another location the same thing happened but they didn’t sell it to me at all. (Side note: these two times were the only times I didn’t go in wearing business clothes from work, dress shirt, tie etc, and surprise surprise I got shit from the staff. Appearance really does matter). 

So two questions I guess:

-is Walmart cracking down on this lately? Where I am there is no state law prohibiting sale so idk why they are doing this. 
-what exactly is an insulin card and can I fabricate something like it? Is it just an insulin prescription? Anything I can do to be more convincing about buying them for legit medical reasons, maybe buy some test strips too? lol...

I also know that there is a form of insulin that is OTC in my state, so maybe if I buy that it will be my ticket to smooth sailing buying sharps?

The past two or three times I've copped off my usual guy, he's given me what looks and tastes like dope, but for some reason it just doesn't get me high at all. It definitely does stop all cravings and symptoms if I do a bag, yet I could literally sit down and rail an entire bomb and it just doesn't get me ""high"".

The bags are normal looking: white, waxy paper baggies, with a red stamp that reads ""POWER"" with a skyline directly above, and the *quantity* is decent. The H itself is normal looking.

I've told my guy now a few times that I do not want this brand, and to please give me the old stuff, but this stuff is apparently all he has right now, so I'm a bit peeved. 

Anybody have any idea what this stuff could be? It doesn't strike me as pure cut, especially since cravings stop after I do a bag. And it doesn't add up that it's just *mostly* cut, because I feel like doing a whole 5 or 6 bags would overcome that issue and I'd get loaded anyway. Could it be Suboxone or something?

Anyways long story short, I was on mmt for about 3 years up to 85mg at my highest and jumped cold turkey from 60mg and went through the longest withdrawl of my life, about a solid month until I got better. (That shit really gets into your bones) 

After that I was clean for about 3 years from everything except weed (which I really don't even consider a drug) and booze (my drinking did get a bit out of control there for a while) 

Naturally I started fuckin around with blues about 2 years ago; and the only on weekends turned into everyday and full blown addiction again very quickly. 

Fast forward a bit; I moved out of state back in February for many reasons; one of which for me (moved with my boyfriend who knows of my past struggles but doesn't know I've been using for the past year ; I'm a piece of shit obv) 

When we moved I came with 1 8mg sub pill, used it to taper than switched to kratom and was completely clean (except kratom) for about a month until naturally I found a new connect out here. 

Been goin hard af on the blues for the past month & a half or so. Just took my last 2 blues (4 total for today) and have decided that's it, I need to take a break for both monetary & tolerance reasons. 

Thankfully I have about 250g of kratom left & managed to cop 1 8mg sub strip. 

Now I've never used the sub strips, I've only used the pills in the past & railed them because I think it works much better that way (ba and what not) and also I'm an addict & love snorting (although I eat my blues because of the higher ba and not wanting to waste them) my question is , has anyone actually snorted a strip? Obv I've googled it and found a few things but would much rather hear about it first hand (experience /methods) from you fine folks :) 

TL;DR: need to take a break from the blues, has anyone snorted sub strips before ? And if so, how did you do it ? And do you think it's worth the effort ? Or should I just use sublingual ? ",1525719983.0

I've been addicted to heroin since I was 14, I'm 22 now. A ""friend"" got me into it and at the time I only knew about black tar heroin, I didn't know it came in a powder form. Anyways I started off smoking it and because it made me feel so incredible I never once questioned what it was. Deep  down I knew it was probably something I surely shouldn't do but I made sure to delude myself enough to not legitimately question it. 

The worst of these 22 years of my life was when my mom died 2 and a half years ago, it was a sudden death, I saw her body afterwards, and I blamed myself because I had a bad premonition but I didn't act on it. Everything went down hill from there, Loosing my mom destroyed me and I lost my job and girlfriend shortly after because I stopped caring about both of them. My dad is the only reason I'm alive. We're closer than ever now.

I got off heroin 20 days ago because I was spending about 300 dollars every 2 or 3 days, shooting up about 80 dollars worth at  a time or in short succession. This sub doctor I got in to see those 20 days ago put me on 24 mg of suboxone a day, because my opiate tolerance was so insanely high, I do not get any kind of high or buzz off of the subs, however I am slowly starting to notice a difference; they are beginning to give me an energy, uplift my mood a little bit, and even make me opiate-tired a little bit after my third dose each day.

Is this a sign my tolerance is lowering? Am I just on too much suboxone? I got my job back and I'm doing very well so a suboxone addiction is the last thing I need. My doctor plans to continue this amount for at least a few more months. Is that a bad idea judging by the effects I'm getting from subs now?

But it’s kind of useless and holds you back because it’s easy to get caught up in a vicious circle of guilt that prevents you from actually doing the work to get back on track. You’ve already apologized a billion times. Your family and friends make you feel more guilty because they don’t know how else to cope. Don’t take it personally but don’t let it bring you down lower. 

If you wanna feel less guilty than do  ACTIONS that will give you a good life and  those bad feelings will lift. 


I need to follow my own advice. But honestly? I’ve gotten  better at letting go. I got to the point where I reached the max of reeling like a POS junkie scum bag. I couldn’t have felt lower.

So at the moment I'm having to wait for the most recent dose to begin to wear off, grit my way through the oncoming sickness until I feel able to piss, and then take the next dose to feel fine again.

Things got bad and I just quit one day, went through the sweats and the illness and the depression...the worst is over and I thought at first I'd never want to turn back but the past few days the cravings crept back. Thinking about the rig and the blood and the rush ahhhhhh can't get it out of my head. Haven't gone to any clinics or therapists, always been a bit wary of that but i do NOT want to relapse so maybe some more seasoned sober people can weigh in. Logically I understand the downsides but this thing isn't logical anyway. Appreciate any advice",1525704740.0

We talked for a few minutes about where I was from and why I moved out here, then I hit them with the question.

I occasionally combine it with Alcohol (Wine, few glasses) or Lyrica (600mg-1g). 

Last night, I combined both and found the effects to be very pleasurable while still allowing me to be fully functional. 

I have in my possession various types of benzos. I have Diazepam, Nitrazepam, Temazepam, Flunitrazepam, Alprazolam, Lorazepam and Clonazepam. Before anyone asks, I am scripted two, have bought several and the rest have been freebies from online purchases.

So to my question; I have combined both Diazepam and Nitrazepam with Oxy (I am scripted these) in therapeutic amounts with obviously no problems. Now, I would like to get the full effect. I have zero benzo tolerance.

Which benzo would compliment Oxy the best and at what dosage to get the best combined effect.

I am fully aware of the risks involved. I would just like an idea from someone with experience of combining the two.

When I found a vein to use, I shot no problem at all, and it went right it. After I pulled the rig out I go to grab my bottle of neosporin, and almost instantly my foot began to insanely itchy. Almost like a violent type of itch, far worse than whenever I get itchy after doing a decent amount of dope. Though the itch (which again was insanely uncomfortably itchy) didn't last more than3 minutes I found it to be super odd because of my 5 years or so of getting high this has never happened.

I've tried looking it up on Google, but instead of an answer titles like ""Heroin makes you itchy!"", etc. Come up. I was wondering if anyone has had this happen to them, or know what the cause is? All I know for sure is that it is not from a miss, I know when I miss, and pull back for blood every 10cc. My buddy said it could be I hit an artery, but I didn't get the burning sensation and awful hive breakout that normally comes along with it.

i just feel so bored and dont know what to do with my evenings. its exam time so my days are studying, then hitting the gym-- leaving me with absolutely nothing to do afterwards -.-

i was feeling pretty good about getting totally clean initially, as i thought things could only get better. while i now feel normal physically, im reminded why i keep starting and stopping-- i feel a sense of emptiness when i have nothing to do with myself and opiates fixed that. I smoke weed every night now but it just makes me that much more stuck in my own head.

thinking about going back but limiting my usage... back in the day i used for almost a year with no serious physical dependancy by saving the H for dinner and having Aderall for breakfast.

to make matters worse, i fell deepest into my addiction the first year of university-- so i havent made much of a social circle here.

Edit: all you guys have given some sound advice-- i absolutely need to find a new hobby besides the gym... it needs to be low effort and a way to unwind in the evenings that doesnt expend much mental energy since this is exam time. im all ears for any recommendations",1525688473.0

I have never IV’d any drug however I would be open to the idea.

Finally after an hour of stabbing pain in my back I feel the pain move around from my back to my side and to my abdomen. Within a few minutes the pain has virtually vanished. 

It is the stone moving from the kidney through the urethra to the bladder that causes all the pain. Once in the bladder, for me a little didn't last longer and didn't require an ER visit. Hopefully this is over for tonight and I can sleep.

I've been sniffing dope since about 2014. It started out as a weekend thing and, well, you know? I'm up to about at least a gram a day.

I started off using in central Florida. It was one connect at the time and the guy that sold it was a really big dude. As in, he had about seven or eight trap houses, had people selling for him on the street. Typical ""drug kingpin"". Thankfully, I knew him personally so I never had to worry about getting ripped off, cut to fuck dope, worry about junkies from the trap, etc.

My friends who had been using for years before I did said this guy and one other guy had the best shit in all of central Florida. I had multiple friends who OD'ed. Some made it out okay. Some not. 

However, my friends who had OD'ed would bang probably a bag or two and wham! Hit the floor. The meantime, I'm sniffing like, eight bags almost every hour.

So what the hell? I'm not trying to OD or anything at all. Obviously.. but am I just lucky? Is my body chemistry designed for me to be able to use more? I'm a six foot six, one hundred, seventy five pound ginger kid. If that makes a difference.

My friends would look at me like I was some sort of a poppy God, heh.. I've been able to cop different dope from hundreds of different people all over the country and the same thing. I don't even feel anything from dope. All I use it for is so I don't get sick. And so I can be ""normal"" acting.

I'm currently up north in Jersey, right next to New York and the same thing up here. Everyone always told me Jersey and New York dope was ""king"". Coming from people who live up here. Believe it or not, I actually find that Florida's shit was absolute fire compare to the stuff I've been getting up here.

So tell me, someone with great opiate/opioid knowledge. How come I can down like, fifteen bags up my nose at one time and barely feel anything and multiple people I know think I'm insane? These are the same people who bang a bag or two and almost go blue and purple. And who have been using twice as long as me.

Shit even my dealers would think I was nuts. They told me about the ""less is better"" idea, but I've done that before thousands of times.

Any thoughts?",1525643805.0

I love my old man more than life, I would die for my kids , but this demon has a hold like no other, a hold and craving that I can shake. I'll probably kill myself soon, I'll probably fuck up the best relationship to the most amazing man I've ever met, and my kids will probably turn their backs on me for good but for today I'm gonna suck down my vodka like it's water and count the days till thursday.

I’ll try and make this as brief as I can. About a year ago I discovered that my wife had been using heroin and fentanyl for about a year. I knew something was going on but I was in denial and told myself she was just really stoned (she smokes a lot) until one night she got really sick and a friend simply said “that ain’t weed”. She finally admitted that she had been using almost daily for about a year. She said the only method she had been using was snorting powder. She said she was ready to stop and I said I would be supportive and do whatever I could to help. Anyway, that was nearly a year ago, but a few months ago I started seeing the old signs again. Nodding off, getting sick randomly, sinuses constantly fucked up, deleting texts, etc. I confronted her many times and she swore she wasn’t using again. So this week we were on vacation and she suddenly starts complaining about abdominal pains, we go to the ER, they blame endometriosis and shoot her up with morphine. I go with a nurse to fill out her paperwork, open her wallet to get her ID, empty baggies and a straw fall out. So here we are the next day. She’s admitted that she’s been using again for the past 3 months and that she ran out on our trip and was dope sick. I have literally no idea what to do. I feel like I’m killing her by supporting her. We flat out can’t afford to send her to a facility. We can’t even afford health insurance so that ER visit is already going to set me back several thousand that I don’t have. She says she wants to get clean. The ER gave her pills that she’s rationed out until we get home so she doesn’t get sick. Is kicking her out the best thing for her? If not, what’s the right way to help her? Her mom is an addict as well, and her dad doesn’t know about any of this. No one knows except for me and a couple of close friends. Should I tell her father? Or does that make things worse?

->Put 30mg on the foil, chased it the best as I could, a good big one hit. I can say I did a good job but at the end I burned it because of lack of practiqse. It didnt taste good at all but I believe It must be an adquired taste. It smells 100% like opium, and taste pretty much the same...

Well..., let me tell you I got a bit disapoint. Felt no rush at all and you could see me like waiting for it... but nothing :(. Bad quality I believe? I just felt relaxed and very dizzy. Didnt throw up, wait 20 mnts and took another hit. Didn´t feel the ""best feeling I could ever feel"", just relaxed. I felt way stronger high with good weed. After some hours went to sleep.

Now... let me tell you, and I am very very surprised by that, the next day I woke up, and after doing my daily routine, went home and tried again. To make it short:

-> Hit - no rush - dizzy - throwed up (was easy as fuck haha) and expected to feel the real high and relief after that but nope... - went bed because can´t handle the dizzy feel reason I dont like alcohol neither... a was there waiting for the feeling (no sure how to describe it) to go away.

After a while I stand up and threw the H down the Toilette. I have the doubt about H being such strong that a person who didnt ever did opiates cant even enjoy it..., or quality was just very bad.. even reviews are pretty positive...

I dont know and dont want to know. I threw the rest away and dont want to know anything anymore about opiates. I did fantasy a lot about how the feeling could be, I even crave it at times how stupid it sounds... Anyway I might get downvoted but thats fine, smoking Heroine is a very stupid decision to say less, but happy to know I just dont like it and I wont ever try to like it if I have to feel the same again.

What are your stories?,"Someone posted earlier asking about the strange feeling he is having in his legs and what that feeling might be and is it happenings because their last dose was 12 hours ago. Unreal to think a regular user could have gone so long without going through any WDs. I posted the following in the comments of that post but wanted to make my first post in this sub. I’m using my second account I exclusively created to lurk dope subreddits and try to find new connects which I am proud to say I successfully did. 

So here is my memory of my first time experiencing withdrawal, specifically the horrors that is restless leg syndrome. 

I remember my first time experiencing RLS from withdrawal and it is a big inside joke now in my relationship. I had RLS as a kid but it was mild and I could eventually fall asleep. That shit is nothing compared to the opiate WD induced variety. 

The first time I had this was the first time I was going to go more than 24 hours after starting to use and consistently using every day for at least two months. I was on a family trip with my boyfriend’s (who miraculously I am still with today) parents and other family friends. We stayed in a little bed and breakfast in NH and I was up all night in extreme agony trying to find any way to stop the feeling in my legs. I stretched them, my bf massaged them and helped me to move them in like a bicycle motion while I was on my back. I shook them continuously, rocked back and forth because moving the rest of my body sometimes helped for a second, walked around the tiny hotel room over and over probably making a shit ton of noise and a million other things but NOTHING helped for more than the shortest amount of time and in the smallest incriminates. The restlessness always came right back. After not sleeping for even one second that night, I had to go on a legit hike up a mountain and then went for a ride as a cramped-in passenger on a glider plane with my future mother in law. Look up a glider airplane and see how small these bad boys are and just the fact I was up in a plane with no engine with the pilot doing loops and shit to try to impress me while withdrawing would have been bad enough without the RLS. I also obviously had to pretend I was having the time of my life since this was a big deal for his parents to take his friends up in the plane. It was absolute torture but I think I pulled it off without being an obvious mess. Fake it til you make it was still relatively possible at this point. 

When we finally left we had to take a 2 hour car ride to the commuter rail station in MA and then an hour train back to our final destination. I didn’t get my fix until 9pm that Sunday and this all started Saturday afternoon. 

This symptom of WDs is the hands down worst one in my opinion. I would rather puke and shit at the same time (a symptom I am lucky enough not to get- no stomach issues except the sweet release of all the stuff that hasn’t come out in days/weeks) then lay in bed like I do for either an hour or ten minutes or thirty seconds then have to get up to walk around because I can’t stand being still without any relief anymore only to need to get back in the bed because walking around is the hardest most tiresome thing you’ve ever done. The feeling of being hot and cold at the same time and needed to be fully clothed and under the covers while also wanted to rip all my clothes off and throw the blankets of the bed does not help the situation at all but at least I feel like I can handle that part of it. 

Repeated this insane up and down, still then moving, shivering then sweating process all damn night or until whenever I could get my next fix.  RLS and the anxiety of knowing it would eventually start became such a regular part of my life that honestly it was one of the main reasons i kept using. I did all in my power to stop my damn legs from feeling like they want to vibrate and do an Irish jig until my calf muscles burnt out. Those muscles would hurt the next day even after I got right because they were on the move all damn night. 

RLS also ended up being the tell tale sign that I had crossed over from the “hey maybe this time the WDs won’t be that bad” into “holy fuck how can I get a bag as fast as fucking possible.” I’ve read on here people saying the yawning and watery eyes are when they know they are starting to get bad. Those symptoms meant to me that I had about 3-4 hours to fix the situation or I would be in agony all night. 

What makes it even worse is that whole first night I went through my first WDs, my boyfriend who I used with then and still am with both through long periods of being clean and dumb relapses such as the one we are in now, was comfortably dead asleep right next to me. That lucky asshole can just sleep through most of his symptoms. Then he wakes up at like 7 asking if I slept well and let’s me know he doesn’t feel good and can we see who is around. If he only knew! But he gets seriously gnarly stomach issues and I just never really have so I can feel good about not having diarrhea or puking I guess. Id trade my RLS for his shitting problems any day. No question. 

So anyone else have an interesting story about popping their WD cherry? 

This was all about 5 or so years ago btw 

tl;dr - my first time experiencing WD was on a mini trip with my BFs parents, had intense RLS, didn’t sleep a wink, hiked a mountain and flew in a glider. Spent  30+ hours like this until my next shot. 0/10 would not recommend. ",1525601726.0

I came clean to my girlfriend that I have been using again and she was completely supportive in the whole situation. She didn't hold anything against me and is just here sticking by my side through withdrawal; which is very rare for someone that is completely clean and has their life all together to be able to do.

This is the first time I've quit because I want to. Not because I'm forced in any way but because I want a better life and I want to be someone I am proud of. I want to be someone my girlfriend of 2 years can be proud of.

When I was in Florida, it was during the pill mill years, where I was prescribed literally every opiate except Opana. I have been in and out of rehab because of this shit over thirteen times and have overdosed about twenty times, most of which were flatline OD's. I haven't seen a pain management doctor since 2013, when I was being prescribed 240 8mg dilaudid pills, 180 100mg MS Contin pills, and 180 2mg Klonopin pills. From 2013-until early 2018, the only thing I took was kratom. About a kilo a month. I stayed clean for the most part, even though in 2016, I had some relapses on IV heroin, and would stay clean (kratom only) for about three months, and then relapse on dope. This went on until about a month ago when I had a major relapse on heroin because I discovered the main dope blocks near my new house, and almost lost my wife. When I ran out of money, and almost lost my job, I decided to get back on Suboxone. I quit the kratom after about five years of daily use (and my gastrointestinal system thanks me for it) and try my best not to use dope more than once or twice a month. Fast forward  to present time, now I'm living in a major city in the North East, and the main opiate options are heroin, fentanyl posing as heroin, and more heroin. I like having a job with insurance, a family that talks to me and a wife at home that is mostly happy with me, so I try to stick with my suboxone regiment. However, the suboxone doesn't do shit for my chronic pain. I have a Primary care doc who writes me the suboxone script but that is all he will write for. What I'm wondering, is if any of you have been in a similar spot where after years of use, you ended up back on suboxone but aren't getting the pain relief you need? I am considering trying to see a pain management doc, and if this was ten years ago, I wouldn't think twice about keeping quiet about the suboxone dr and then getting pain pill scripts from the pain management dr, but I'm pretty sure that insurance companies and pharmacies are all linked together with the new system that would make it nearly impossible to doctor shop. Do you think I could talk my doctor into switching me to Subutex, so I could ask for a referral to pain management and then ask them to keep the subutex for daily use and then get something for breakthrough pain? Is this even a possibility? I know this sort of regiment is possible on methadone, but I will never go back on methadone. I love how suboxone allows me to not be dopesick and function at work, but I'm still in pretty severe pain daily. I'm at a 6/10 from the time I wake up until the time I go to sleep, and it jumps to 8/10 after a rough day at work or just from overuse of my leg/ankle from walking too much. I really could use any advice that any of you might have because as much as I love being clean and sober for the most part and just using suboxone every day, I can't stand the actual physical pain.

I was at 4mg then broke my arm. My doctor upped my dose to 24mg in the hopes it would allow me to manage pain with out full blown agonists. Well something clicked and I pretty much got maliciously addicted to the suboxone and started taking six or more 8mg tabs a day. Needless to say my 28 day prescriptions where running out pretty early and I would frantically throw large sums of money in order to encourage anyone I could to sell me some of there precious supply.

It worked for a few months, well worked in a fucked up way for me. Finally I went through the script in two weeks and no one was around to spare anything. I didn’t tell my doctor or counselor, I still haven’t. 

I needed to get through. I have a job, I’m the bread winner for the family, I wasn’t (and still am not) thinking rationally. I had no connections. I magically managed to arrange an internet cold cop. I reached out through the most suspicious ways and some shining soul answered me. 

Very nervously I met up with this person. I had taken my last 6mg of suboxone that morning. I gave him my money and he gave me his dog. After a little wait he came back and gave me my item: snow white shiny powder, most likely fentanyl. 

I brought it home and did a small test bump. Then another, then another. Due to the bupeprenorphine still in my receptors I didn’t feel high, but I did feel relieved. Through the next couple days I continued to do it while the subs left my system. By day 3 is way undeniable, I was getting high from a full agonist opiate.

Does it sure feel good. Mostly the quality has been good and I have been in bliss. I know this can’t last, I know I need to stop. I managed to get some suboxone, I am just in such a honeymoon period. 

Now the shitty positive. While on such a high dose of suboxone I for the life of me was not having good regular bowel movements. Now early in the morning I get to wake up, have that wonderfully euphoric first fix and then take a nice large easy BM.

Sometimes I even end up doing them during the week and going to work buzzed.

For those of you who are unaware, Suboxone is a HUGE drug in jail/prison. 

I can only speak for Massachusetts (though, I'd hazard to guess it has reached all corners of the continent by now, what with the opioid epidemic spanning just as wide) when I tell you it's so widely used/abused-- crossing all racial, class, and criminal boundaries-- that on a given day, if you were to drug test the entire state prison population in MA, close to 70% of inmates would come back positive for bupe. This is not hyperbole, or exaggeration to stress the point; it is hard-earned knowledge from nearly a decade's experience. 

While the county jails have not been so greatly affected by this epidemic, upstate, where there are contact visits at 95% of the prisons, it is entirely possible to go years without ever running into trouble w/r/t procuring it-- should your financial means allow it, that is. 

Since 2011, when Reckitt Benckiser's patent for buprenorphine/naloxone pills expired, and the advent of film, the price inside, for Suboxone, has gone down considerably-- thanks entirely to the ease with which it can be smuggled into a facility via the visiting room. Previously, the more voluminous tablets, ever proving a burden and risk with respect to smuggling, would routinely yield a 2000% profit on their $10 street value; while the film, however, eventually settled at a much more reasonable $50. Once the Suboxone are introduced to the facility (usually 250-400 film per visit) and distributed to the plethora of dealers trying to cash in on a highly lucrative economy,  you can purchase Suboxone across a wide range of quantities, at a variety of prices. 

While buying ""singles"" for $50 each is quite common, it is far from your only option. You can buy in bulk and save money (5 for $200; 10 for $350; 40 for $1,000; 100 for $2,000; and even 1,000 for $17,500). Additionally, for the more industrious and business-savy addict, he can buy in bulk and turn a profit by selling part of his stash in what are known as ""pieces"" (2mg-- aka a quarter or a quaker-- for $20; 1mg-- aka an eighth-- for  $15, 0.5mg-- aka a sixteenth or a teena-- for $8; and, for desperate times, 0.25mg-- aka a thiry-second or tray-duece-- for $5). All in all, it's a distressing economy-- the whole thing. It costs so much money to maintain a habit -- more than likely your family are sending the dough via Western Union or the like to some female gang member who's willing to walk into prison with her lady-safe packed to the gills with a balloon of Subs-- that it just makes no sense. It's Suboxone! 

That honeymoon phase can't be stretched to cover 5, 10, 20 years. But boy, do we try! We try the seemingly more bioavailability- advantageous routes of administration (are there even?); we play close, acute attention to its effects and try to reason that we are high-- when, in fact, we are just not sick; we tell ourselves, It might be costing Grandma $250 a week, but God dammit, at least I'm jammed. It's horrible. 

Suboxone has a great role in recovery from opioid addiction-- in fact, I take it presently; however, when abused to the extent it is in prison, it has an adverse effect. Addicts who should be clean by virtue of incarceration, are now leaving prison opioid-addicted (if only partially)-- and having sought their drug, and handled their drug, and consumed their drug, with addict behaviors, ostensibly they are going to seek to meet those needs with an actual drug upon hitting the streets. 

While I managed to kick my 8mg a day habit prior to my release in 2017, I had never afforded myself the opportunity to divorce those addict behaviors and actually work on myself and my recovery. Within 28 days of my release (I took the Vivirtol injection 3 days prior to going home-- having had been 3 weeks Suboxone-free-- and assumed that would be my cure) I relapsed. It's been close to a year since I was released-- June 30th, 2017-- and I am three months clean. I take 8mg per day, and I work a recovery program. I don't credit Suboxone for my 90 days in recovery, but I am grateful to have it as a crutch. 

TL;DR: Massachusetts, along with most states, has terrible Suboxone epidemic in it's state prisons. I spent 8 years consumed by the drug in there. I left no better than when I went. Clean now.

I still have a hard time believing I've made it this far, the two months in jail definitely helped a lot. When I first got locked up I was 50 pounds underweight and had IV fluids for two days. 

Just wanted to let you guys know that I know exactly what it's like to not want to get clean, to see no point in life and feeling like if I can't get high life isn't worth living. It's been a long, slow process of getting to know myself again and re learn new habits. A lot of (in my opinion) assholes will say getting sober has been great and they have their life back etc but for me honestly it's been so difficult. This is the first time as an adult I have been functioning in society without drugs. It's frustrating and sometimes it feels like it's not worth it. 

Heroin was my solution, my distraction from this shitty world and hate for myself. I loved that sanctuary but looking back I didn't know what love was. Learning how to love myself again currently. Maybe after that I can learn to love life the way I see others loving it. 

It's a long ass road and it's been difficult so far, but I encourage you to at least try it before you make up your mind about being a forever junkie. I love this sub and have been lurking for years. Thanks for your time and letting me vent. ",1525534429.0

Sometimes I wish for it to just take me out already. This addiction has ruined all my relationships family and romantically continuously for the past few years and most of them can never be fixed. 

I am on day 3 of WD for the 1000th time and no matter what I do I just want to escape this reality. Opiates, alcohol, whatever to numb the world for just a few hours. I feel nothing but dysphoria and like I have half a fucking soul when I'm sober. I dont want to be like this. I envy normal people. I almost gave everything important left in my life up for just one more fix.

I broke down and asked for help instead. I have issues with asking fir help and thinking I can control my life but over time I know that isnt true no matter how strongly I feel I can. The exact thinking that got me into the beat of opiates, thinking I can control what 30 million people around the world struggle with. I know with the things that I have done that if I wasnt born in the USA I would be dead or killed for the things I have done, simple as that. But I am still here, Ive contracted Hep C from sharing needles, and yet my body is fighting it off on its own. Ive Overdosed waking up from death in the ambulance several times, yet always woke up, even the worst time where I need 3 doses of IV narcan to bring me back.

Real quick, I must apologize about my writing. I know I run on sentences and topics, I just type from my mind and thats about how fast Its going atm.

Continuing on,  if there is a God, then he must have something important for me to do, and thus everyone has some kinda potential to meet, no matter the path they take in life. 

The last love of my life used to joke that I am the luckiest person she knows, I dont know how right she is, maybe im being kept alive as punishment. To endure all of this mess. Whatever the reason, if I make it out, I have plenty of writing material for a decent book maybe haha

Now with that being said, If I go and refill my prescription of Xanax, or any prescription for that matter, will that show up on his computer next time I see him? Because i know this one doctor I saw before they asked me the last time
I took my prescriptions, and they logged it. Like whether I took it today, yesterday, this week, etc.

I know you can find them if you look but not quite what I am looking for here)?

So! I occasionally get dope off of my boyfriends brother. Now while we are all junkies and do some grimey shit sometimes, this kid is like that times ten. Anyway. I give him 50$ at 3:30 to go and grab five tickets (that’s what he calls stamp bags), and says I’ll be back in about an hour. Which is completely fine because it is a while away. I also give him money for gas and an extra ten to grab himself a bag as well. 

The hour passes and I text him to see what’s up. He’s at the place getting it but apparently (and please understand that I do not condone this type of language nor do I participate in it. However, I don’t say anything to defend it), “I’ve been here since 4:30 but you know how these fucking n-words take forever.” Whatever. The worst part? It doesn’t even end up happening because he had to be a super awesome dad (/s) and get home to get his daughter for the weekend. I get that. Fine. He then informs me “I can get different tickets as soon as I get back though.” Well first off, why in the fuck didn’t you do that in the first place?! Whatever. 

So FINALLY he says meet me at so and so street, so I make my way over. And who happens to be with him?! His toddler aged fucking daughter. Who knows me as Aunty brokenhalfjap. Terrific. The best part?! Instead of five bags I end up with three. Because apparently the kid he got them from charges a bag and he spent the ten I gave him, as well as the gas money, on god knows what and needed a bag but “you know I got you tomorrow.” 

I guess my question is .. what would you do in this situation?! He is my only connect for dope and as a middle class average looking white girl, who likes to wear dresses and look as nice as makeup allows me to, its hard to find a plug that’ll actually deal with me. Is this just part of the game? Or would you guys get out now before losing out on any other money? This isn’t the first time this has happened either. Thank you friends. ",1525479572.0

Drowsed in sleep savageries, 

with mouth wide-a-pout for a sultry kiss

A child and man paced side by side

Treading the skirts of eventide

But between the clasps of his hand and hers

Lay felt-not twenty withered years.

She turned with the route of her south dusk hair

And saw the sleeping gypsy their

She snatched and snapped in swift child's whim 

With keep it long as you live to him

And a smile like nymphs from their laving meres 

Trembled up from a bath of tears, 

And Joy like a mew'd sea rocked apart 

Tossed upon the wave of his troubled heart

--No flower, but twenty shrivell'd years

Was not such thing 'till this hour. 

Low to his heart, he said, "" the flower

Of sleep brings awakening to me, 

And of oblivion memory.

'O Child, I love, for I love and know!'

you give this withering flower of dreams.

So far none of these methods have worked... so now I am seriously considering this plan: walk into the bathroom immediately after getting Vivitrol, bust out a sterile syringe/sterile needle (same length needle that was used to give the shot), then stab myself right over the injection site and attempt to aspirate as much as possible.

I always keep delaying the stopping part because I’ve been through the heroin withdrawals and don’t want to go through that ever again. If it wasn’t for the being sick part I could quit no problem. I don’t want to get sick and have my family find out I’m back on opiates. I just did a 5 year stretch for a distribution charge and I’ve been home 9months. Here I am back on pills again. However I do work a full time job that I make 25 an hour at so I’m not out there robbing and stealing to get my pills. I do however always have to borrow money because my habit cost more than I make at my job. I also do some side work where I make a few hundred here and there but I’m still in the hole. I absolutely love the high and I work so much better when I’m on. I know everyone is gonna say go to classes or rehab but that’s not an option with my current situation.

Its a brand new tamper resistant oxycodone,"I have a bunch of the 18mg xtampza er capsule. So far I tried just straight cooking them and they dont seem to be water soulable. The powdery micro beads melt down to liquid that is a goldish color but floats to the edges and doesnt mix with boiling water. I tried dry frying them too. Melting them down alone to a puddle then rapodly squirting water but after the steam and bubbles clear again they seperate. Once you melt it down and let it cool the oily liquid hardens to a white waxy material. You cant crush the beads down either. They are basically powder and grinding it turns it into a sticky wax paste. Can't snort them because they dont dissolve. I left some in a spoonful of coca cola over night and can to find flat coke with the small beads turned to wax floating on top. I read in a bluelight thread that citric acid works but tried that and again, they become a sticky wax blob. I even got desperate and microwaved the powder hoping it woukd dry out and i could pulverise it ibto something to snort. No dice there either. It melts into a puddle then catches fire before the luid gets a chance to dry. I read that too was designed in response to people microwaving OP ocycontin and OP pandas to dry then grind with hose clamps. They spent 7 years developing this shit and it really covers all bases. We need to think outside the box or soon enough all pharm opis will be garbage and heroin will be the only option unless you can get hospital vials of liquid opiates.  

Is there no way to defeat the time release on this shit? I ate 180mg of them at once letting the powder soak in my mouth a while and felt not a damn thing. These are prescribed for moderate to severe pain and to be taken 3x a day. The person who gets them is getting them for cancer. They took her off of 30mg morphine ir 3x a day, 8mg dilaudid 4x a day or as needed, and 15mg roxi for breakthrough pain. All that daily for 20 months now she gets Xtampza 18mg 6x a day and tramadol 50mg as needed. She has never been suspected of abusing her meds and this is in a state known for elderly people and opiate prescriptions. He dr told her the dea has enacted new rules and new policies are in place to phase out what they deem ""abusable narcotics"" ao that not even generics will be passed by the FDA if they dont meet the new requirements. Those being they cannot mix with water and they cannot be broken down in any form to be used in an instint fashion.


Naturally I thought the dr was bullshitting but I personally know over 40 people who get hardcore narcotics most for pain management. And juat this past month they have one after another been reduced to getting 5 days supplies of dilaudid no matter who they are. The regular month script is written out but the FDA has a policy that is being implimented to where you must return to your pharmacist every 5 days for more of your pills. No longer will they fill the entire month supply at once. The policy change isnt in full effect ywt but many of the more notable doctors are already making the change ahead of time at the urge of their lawyers. In the likely event they get charged with unethical behavior due to overprescribing they can fall back on being early adopters of the new Trump lead policy.

The marketing for these Xtampza er's claim the formula allows you to absorb more oxy than regular instant release so the 18mg pill is supposed to equal 20mg instant release. The 36mg pill is supposed to equal 40mg instant release. How the fuck can they claim that in good faith when 10 of the 18mg pills did jack shit to me? I read all pharma companies are now testing this wax formula and planning to release all prescription opiates with this new formula so that orally is the absolute only route possible.

Control; what is the red Sea tide?

It comes hard, fast and... calm.

It's dies again; the red, dead tide. 

Swept away: a crimson, lunar sea

Bleeds heavily, then dies.

This is mine This is my calm

These my shallow lives

My lacerations by knife
 
Severing blossoms of white 

I cut deep for the life of me 

I cut deeper: this is all I find;

What is the red sea tide? 

It comes hard, fast and... 

Nothing.

Dies. The red, dead tide. 

These crimson seas bleed.

Into the sky

A skepard's sky

And die.

To Someone's delight 

It dies 

It's mine

It's mine.

8h1sip,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8h1sip/update_from_when_the_pharmacy_humiliated_me/,7,https://redd.it/8h1sip,PoisonKiss43,UPDATE from when the pharmacy humiliated me.,"If you missed my post about the pharmacy asking me to jump through some crazy/weird hoops, just check my post history. 


So since this incident where I went to get the Xtampza filled. I have had to the pharmacy 3 times. My plan was to use a mom and pop. I honestly just didn’t get around to doing it. I was going to try Publix because people in the pain management waiting room were talking about pharmacy issues and everyone who didn’t have any said “Publix, Publix,Publix”. Publix is like a Kroger, Stew Leonards (gosh I miss that place so much </3) etc.

So anyway I decided to just give it a shot. I got to the Walgreens and I drop off my 120 norco 10 RX. 31 days since the last fill. I have filled this rx here at this exact location for the past year with 0 problems. Different lady take it, takes my ID (I haven’t got the address changed) tells me “give us about an hour or so sweetie”..... no problem
I have shit to do anyway. When I pick it up give them my ID different person a younger male he says “can you confirm your address?” “I said it’s the one listed in your system I ordered a new ID”  he said “ ok no worries. He reminded me that my address on my scripts is still the old one to make sure I change it in my doctors system too. 

A few days later I drop off my adderall RX, its for 45 20mg IR. I’m like a week late, which is fine again no biggie. The lady there still not the one old bitch. Again they have no problem just explain I’m waiting for my new ID and that someone that worked there changed it before I had my new ID.

Then again a few days later I drop off my Xanax RX. Its for 0.5mg 30 of them. Last time I dropped it off was in 12/2017. They last me a long time, I had 2 refills believe but again they last, I usually take 0.25 anyway. As I go to drop it off....... guess who is there? The OLD BITCH! I had my phone ready with a picture of the online website where I paid to have the address changed and proof that it’s on the way. I hand her the RX and my current ID. My heart is fucking racing. She says “ok well let’s see when the last time you got this filled was”.... I’m thinking really bitch? You can keep that to yourself but whatever. I said “ I believe it was December”. She said “yep December, Good girl” and I was like “yep, they last a long time”. When I picked them up, different lady, no problem just told her ID was ordered. 

So I realize that not only did the pharmacist probably not even say that shit that she told me he did, but basically she’s just a jaded, crotchety, old bitch. I feel much better about it. ",1525461208.0

But before that, of course I loaded up the last of my gear so I could think clearly. My next thought was, ""How can I get $80 today?"" 

My paycheck doesn't come for another day, and decide to try my luck with Craigslist and a burner computer I use for DNM. I advertise it as a Dell Inspiron with Tails installed. A few hours later, I got an offer and met up with a Chinese man outside of a Starbucks conveniently close to the hood. (Starbucks in the hood, I know right?)

I call my usual man immediately after my sweaty fingers crumple up the twenty-dollar bills this man so graciously saved me with, but to no avail. His line's dead. I owe my other man most of what I have in my hand, and I don't want to deal with another spot. Another guy will be available in 30 minutes.

So I drive a little bit deeper into the scoring vicinity, and stand outside for a smoke. That's when would-be Junkie Jesus, carrying a bike frame in one arm, and a box of Newports in the other - asks me for a light. He asks if I'm from around here, to which I reply ""No, but my guy is."" He says, ""Who's your guy? I'm the guy around here."" I explain to him how I'm looking for food, and without hesitation he hops in the passenger side of my old Camry.

He has me drive around the block twice, says that it's all clear and to give him the money and he's going to run and grab some ""uncut shit"" from this house with boarded up windows and lawn chairs tossed around the front yard. I'm not keen on giving my money to strangers, so we reach an agreement where he'll keep his phone, cigarettes, and bike frame in the car while he goes to get it.

Sickness is starting.

He comes out twenty minutes later, and says ""Aight man, now we gotta head over to the lab and cut this shit. Copped 12 grams, one of those are yours."" Fuck me - just give me the uncut shit now and I'll worry about my safety later. 

So we head to the laboratory, across town to a community of equally distraught homes and lawn chairs. He runs inside for an hour, comes back out and says we're going to pick up from elsewhere. Fuck me, this is a second red flag.

Well now my dealer's calling me back, so I tell him I need my money back - no shit he spent it on his own crack, but he knows everyone around this area and that it won't be a problem.

I drive around for five hours, taxi cabbing this fifty year old man hitting some of the strongest crack I've had in my life. But I'm sick now, so we pull over to the motel where I get serious - I tell him I need shit or money now. He knocks on every door asking if anyone has food. What the fuck. I make him call his boy at the lab. He tells me, ""Ain't no traffic at the lab while they cookin' up, you crazy boy?"" I retaliate with ""Well how long, I've been waiting 6 hours?"" I'm informed they're cooking up kilos in there and it'll take a few hours.

Not so much later, we pull into a gas station so he can get an Arizona and I leave his ass. The things I'll do for a fix.

Over a period of 8 days I pretty much took them every 3.5-4 hours, even at night. Well 2 days ago I stopped taking them cold turkey because I wanted a break, didn’t think anything of it. But my entire body feels like all the joints and muscles deeply hurt, even in my fingers. I can’t sleep well, I wake up every other hour feeling like I need to stretch my legs. I’ve also been sweating a lot. I googled it and it sounds like these could be a withdrawal symptoms. I’m still able to live my life, I’m not bedridden or anything, but I don’t like it. Although this is minor compared to what many others are going through, it’s uncomfortable. To top it off, I’m in legit pain again, Motrin isn’t helping, I called my doctor and he said to take the Percocet as directed. I won’t be taking it as often, no way. 

So my questions are, can I take a Percocet here and there for pain? Or just stop altogether and suffer - in pain and mildly withdrawing? How the hell does this work? Like I need this medication right now but I don’t want to create further issues.

So, after five years of really, really abusing my veins with a combination of poor technique, UK heroin that requires citric acid to become injectable, cocaine & occasionally injecting straight alcohol into them, my veins are now well & truly fucked. I spend over an hour trying to hit a vein on my arms & hands, and when I do get blood the majority of the time the vein is so shallow that it slips right out again.

The veins in my feet are too shallow to hit, and I've never ever been able to hit my legs, which for some reason have no visible veins at all. The vast majority of the long-term junkies I know in person use their femoral vein, and though I really really envy the speed & ease with which they can shoot up, I also know how risky it is and don't want to join them.

Can anyone offer any suggestions for what I could do? Are there any non-visible veins that I could try to hit? Is it safer to go in the jugular vein than in the groin? I'm really desperate for some suggestions - it feels like I'm one missed hit away from just saying fuck it and grabbing some 2ml barrels and figuring out where this fucking femoral is. 

Also, I recently did 40 days with nothing but buprenorphine, so I was expecting that my veins would be somewhat better by now. Nope. The only change was 2 new veins appeared, and both of them were gone again after one use. This is infuriating.
