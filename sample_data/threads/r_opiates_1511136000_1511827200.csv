Question about Narcan..,"Good morning everyone, I have been wanting to post here about my questions but not entirely sure if anyone would know the answer and maybe I should also ask in r/methadone 

 I have been on methadone for years and at my clinic they have posts up all over the place about getting your free Narcan kit. I have lurked in this subreddit for forever and have seen just way to many post and comments about how you people wish you could afford or get your hands on Narcan and I know that there are a few people on here that are amazing and send packs of all sorts to ppl in need and for free and I think that's just amazing. Ok on to my question do you think or does anyone know if I can ask for Narcan multiple times. I don't use anymore so really the ppl that work in the clinic would wonder why I want more then one kit even if I spread out the times of when I ask for the next kit. I live in a city that has almost zero heroin use and it's mostly pills and I haven't heard to much about the pills here being laced with fent but also because of that I feel like asking for a few kits and sending them to those who really need it isn't a big deal here. I obviously don't want to tell the clinic my real reason but if I can get my hands of even just a few and mail them out it's better then none. Just wondering if anyone in Canada has asked for multiple kits and what did they say? I want to help if I can and I thought that might be a start. In Ontario kits are paid for. At least where I am it's free. I've been thinking about it a lot lately and I just want to help if I can. It should be free to everyone!

Thanks and if someone could direct me to where I can donate to the ppl on here that make kits for people, I'd love to donate to them too.",1511191124.0

But after some horrific experiences and that  I truly decided and told myself that I needed to quit was I finally able to conquer my demon. I don’t have any major advice for getting clean but I may be able to offer some words that can motivate some looking to get clean.

One of the best feelings I’ve ever felt (even over heroin) was when during my early days of getting clean that I realized “holy shit I haven’t thought about heroin in days”.

It used to be wake up -> think of heroin, get heroin -> then think of how ill get more heroin once I come down, repeat.

It’s such a fucking relief to no longer feel that cycle or daily thoughts anymore.

Another one of the most important things ever said to me was when I went to visit my good friend after not seeing him for months that his mother said that “I look like I’m doing much better.” That really fucking stuck with me because I never felt my use would be that noticeable to where someone would ever say that. But it was. And that small sentence meant the world to me after hearing and really set my mind on being off this shit forever.

figured I'd post this & see where it went. I don't know anyone else who messes with ops so I'm talking here.

for a about a year I've been pretty heavy into drugs. I've always been interested in them & smoked weed quite a bit since I was 17. I lost my mother when I was 17 in a car crash & just turned 22 on the 4th. 
around this time last year my great grandmother passed whom I was very close to and it hit me hard. I think the next week I randomly hit up a dude I knew and asked if he had any H. 
I had done more than my fair share of pills & (stupidly) was sure I wouldn't get addicted. after a few weeks of just buying points & loons, I was hooked. I did it every chance I got. sold some cool shit I regret blah blah blah you guys know how it goes.
i had tried coke a few times before & one night I wanted to get some after my first payday at my job I started as some sort of twisted celebration I guess?? long story short, I got arrested that night for possession of coke (1g).
I started my 3 year probation in February this year. I have quit doing H since all that happened last year but I'll still hit it if it's around for whatever reason I don't know.
in the past month I've got my first job I have ever actually been proud of. my first job learning a trade. however in the past month I've also been buying coke. like a gram every 3-4 days. (I definitely stretch it out.) it helps me at work & makes me more confident which is something I've always had a lot of trouble with.
I've never been one to admit I need to go to a therapist or whatever but I'm confused & was curious about a couple things. 

-I've never been a fan of uppers but I've grown very fond of the one mentioned above.

-I feel like I subconsciously switched dependency? I was happy to finally not be dependent on opiates.

-I am supposed to be taking drug tests for my probation. why can't I shake this hopeless feeling & make myself care more? I find myself pushing meetings back.

-why can't I be happy with the good life that I have? I've been asking this for too long. /:

I ask these things because I am finally in a good place in life apart from the problems mentioned & would love nothing more than to be as happy as I should be. DMs are cool too. thanks for reading this shit storm of a post. no negative comments please. I get enough. ",1511168039.0
7e7k5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e7k5s/questions_on_oxynaxolone_pills/,7,https://redd.it/7e7k5s,OstoFool,Questions on oxy/naxolone pills,"I'm from Australia and doctors are generally just prescribing Targin now. Brand names might differ from country to country, but they are extended release oxy/naloxone blends at a ratio of 2:1.

What we know: naloxone is added to prevent abuse and help relieve constipation. It does help with the latter, but you absolutely cannot take Targin with any other ROA other than oral to minimize the naloxone exposure. You can crush the pills up and parachute them for IR, however the maximum prescribed dose of 40/20 has been successful in limiting abuse. I'm prescribed 15/7.5 pills, and I can catch a quick high with potentiators (DXM and GF Juice) if I bomb 3 at once. 45/22.5 is the maximum dose I can take before the nax starts to pull the oxy away in noticeable amounts. Even though oral bioavailability is less than 2%.

What I can't figure out is the naloxone half life. Apparently it's only 30-80minutes, regardless of ROA, so hypothetically, I should be able to stack oxy doses two hours apart and get higher. I've even stretched this to 2.5 hours, but I swear additional pills only seem to sober me up due to naloxone concentration, when the original dose should have metabolized out of my system by that point.

These abuse-proof pills are getting rolled out in other countries apparently, so surely it's something that other users have had to experiment with. It's going to affect all pill users eventually.

So, for those that have been using oxy/nax blends...

What is the max dose of oral oxy/nax you can do at one time before getting diminishing returns from the naxolone?

How long between doses can you get high from without naloxone concentrations building up and killing it?

This is unlikely, but has anyone found a way to filter out the naloxone from pills, or found an enzyme that can motabilize it faster?

I'm convinced that high oral naloxone concentrations increase the half life of the drug considerably, because I can take another 40/20 parachuted two hours after a previous dose and I feel straighter than had I not taken it at all. And according to all literature, the original dose of naloxone should have passed by that point.

I gave it four hours yesterday between bombs and still felt very dimished returns. I'm wondering if it's just me and I don't metabolize naloxone as fast as others do, but it's killing my high in a big way. I absolutely cannot stack oxy doses and basically can't get high anymore.

I swear I could get higher off one 30mg IR oxy than a 50mg oxy/25mg nax bomb that I'm doing these days. Tolerance aside. The naloxone is not only capping my ceiling dose of oxy, but I find it reduces the effectiveness by at least 30%.

This is gonna affect all of you soon. Apparently the oxycontin manufacturer is going to roll it out globally to try and hold a monopoly on the ER oxy market since the patent is expiring soon.

It would be great if a redditor with some experience in pharmacology could comment on how to remove or at least metabolize the naxolone quicker.

Or provide some insight into possible extended oral half life of naloxone in high concentrations, because the pharmacology on it that's well published doesn't make sense. The half life is extending well beyong the 80 minutes!

Someone tell.me they are in the same boat. Apparently Targin are flooding the dark net too, because that's all doctors are prescribing in many countries.",1511167897.0

Sketchy as fuck. My ""friend"", Cliff convinced me to spend my last $190. That the following day his friend would deliver 30 subs + give him $85 that would go right back into my pocket. I've asked four times and I still don't remmeber why the guy was supposed to pay us $85. If the story was true, perhaps he was lying about the price of a bun to the guy.... Oh yeah and part of the deal would be that we would buy two buns of H for the sub connect's brother. The sub connect doesn't use dope anymore but his brother does.

&nbsp;

First on Thursday night the goal post kept getting moved forward until I was on my way home with the understanding that the subs would be delivered by 7:30am. Cliff texted me at 7:30 stating the guy was not called into work and would come around later. 

Later that afternoon Cliff says ""the sub connect left his house at 2pm."" After that no he alleged that he got no more message responses.

Around 5pm that day Cliff text me that he made a mistake. Upon arriving at his house he explains that, the sub connect's brother came by his house at 7:30 am to pick up the two buns. That the sub connect stopped answering his phone after 2pm and now the phone is off. 


&nbsp;

Great so now I'm out $190, and have no way to get my anxiously awaited subs. Oh wait, Cliff found $20 in his other pants. So he gives that to me, I go to find his sister but she's out so I can't get subs through her at that time.

The following morning, he calls my cell and house phone. Explains that the dboy is willing to credit a bun if we give him the $20. I fucking snap, like damn it all to hell. Fucking have some damn patience or something and wait.. splitting a bun between two people gets them well for a night and a day but a sub can last much longer especially the way I cut them up. 

Well, I gaveh im back the $20 because I'm a junkie and wouldn't mind one last hurrah of getitng high.. plus wishful thinking, maybe he's not lying about his friend with 30 subs and maybe that guy will miraculously show up. 


&nbsp;

So I snort some fent powder (the dboy literally said it was fent) mixed with what seemed like salt and I was quite faded that night and well for up to 16 hours after my last does. Even after that I didn't feel ill effects until the cold air started getting me and eating dominos pizza didn't help. My ""friend"" didn't rob me of half a bun as I thought he might. I was expecting him to say ""dboy only delivered half a bun... here's two bags."" So if he was truthful and honest about splitting a bun with me, maybe he wasn't lying about my $190 going towards subs?


Fuck, I'm making my own head spin. I think it's likely I was scammed... That's why I already made a doctor's appointment on my next pay day. I need to separate myself from this shit, I'm too easy to manipulate and take advantage of. I'm sick and tired of going to work dope sick. 


As for the money, without insurance I'll still come out ahead going to a psyciatric professional.

&nbsp;


**Long story short:**
tl;dr:

I managed to borrow $20 from another friend, bought two subs and provided some services the person who walked to the sub connect and who successfully procured subs. I thanked my ""friend's"" sister profusely and helped her patch a hole in her air mattress, and ran a long CAT5e cable so that her computer would no longer be plagued by wifi issues when streaming TV. 

When I indicated I was gonna give half a sub to her brother she detested the idea. ""Those are for you.."" she said in addition to platitudes about her brother being a lazy con artist which are somewhat true but who am I to judge?

I told my friend Cliff that I'd try to get the subs in the morning before work.. moved the goal post forward a bit as he often does to me.

**Question:**

Do I give Cliff half a sub tomorrow or say fuck him? I can technically part with half a sub based on my taper plan, but it never hurts to have extra. 

Sometimes he has helped me stay well but other times he has lied to me and left me in a vulnerable position such as going to work outright dopesick after counting on a lie from him.

So in my mind he's an okay guy and wouldn't do me wrong. Like he's given me fronts and shit.

Until one night I'm with him in his car and I forgot my prescription bottle of 38 Xanax bars inside it. I proceed to blow up his phone to no avail. At this point I'm fucking livid and ready to curbstomp this fucker. So I go home and sleep it off and wake up still ready to kick ass but I have nowhere to find him, even went to his house but there were no cars there.

Anyway, a good friend of mine from back in the day calls me today saying he hit a lick on S. Apparently my boy was buying some dab rigs from S but when S gets in the car he gets a Glock with a 50 round drum in his face and gets told to run his pockets. So he takes everything from him from his phone to his car and leaves him in Sacramento without any shoes on and tells him to walk home. As I'm hearing this I busted up laughing because I knew karma would get him back. 

Anyway, moral of the story is don't fuck people over because you don't know who they know.",1511149056.0

Everything is perfect!,"For a long time, my routine used to be one half gram shot shortly after I woke up, and that was my dope for the whole day until I went to sleep, woke up, rinsed and repeated. 
Lately, though, I’ve been doing very small shots (half a .1 to one .1) throughout the whole day so I can satisfy my needle fetish and collect more cottons. 
If you go through my post history and look at my most recent post before this one, you’ll see I had a shitty night tonight, on top of all the shitty bullshit-ass fucked up problems going on in my life lately. So tonight I said “Fuck it!” and loaded up about .6 to .7 in a single shot. I registered and blasted off. 
I haven’t gotten a rush or even gotten high off dope in probably a month or so because of my tolerance and the fact I don’t let myself buy more than a $20 half g each day, and that’s not enough to feel it even if I do the whole half g in one shot. 

And HOLY GODDAMN FUCKING SHIT, man...! That rush!!! 
I wasn’t expecting it to hit me so strong, but as soon as that rush hit me, it was so strong that I had trouble seeing straight and focusing my eyes. Goddamn have I missed a true, full-strength heroin high. This is why I fell in love with Mistress Heroin. 
I feel like I’m on top of the world, invincible, like everything is perfect. Now I’m just riding that beautiful, beautiful high and smoking a cigarette on my back porch with my husband. I’m not particularly physically affectionate, but I feel so fantastic that I asked him for a big bear hug and a bunch of kisses. (Which made my husband very happy. 😍😍😍) 

On a final note, I hope my whole r/opiates family is doing as great as I am tonight!
 Everyone who’s using, I hope your high is as amazing as mine. Remember to stay safe. You can always do more but you can never do less. Keep Narca around and make sure you’re with someone who knows how to administer it. 
Everyone who’s sober, or trying to stay sober, you can do it! Just take it one day at a time, sometimes even just minute to minute. Stay strong! 
And to everyone, stay safe and have a great night!!! Love you all! I feel like I belong here and (for the most part) everyone here is so accepting and positive and helpful. It really feels like a family here, albeit a fucked up, disfunctional, addict-ridden family. I love each and every member here and am glad to share a space with you all. Anyone who ever wants/needs to talk, about anything at all, is more than welcome to PM me anytime and I’ll listen and give advice with absolutely no judgement. I promise.

I made a post a few days ago describing my current situation in life. Well, things went from bad to worse. Three days ago my mother accused me of being ""stoned"" or snorting coke, when I was not even high. I had been around her high the day before, and she didn't say a word. She lashed out and attacked me, so I decided that there was no way I could go home. I called my grandmother, and she said I could stay with her. Well, when my mom found out I was with my grandmother, she lost her shit even more. She said that she would never talk to me, or my grandmother again. She said that I betrayed her. My father then proceeded to call my grandmother and bitch her out for taking me in. So now I have created some huge ass problem within my family. Holy shit. How could my father bring my grandmother into the problem like that? I feel terrible. Next, the only friend I had pulled some bullshit on me. We have been friends for years now, and he has suddenly declared that he's madly in love with me. He knows all of the bullshit I've been going through, and yet he decided to throw that on me. I feel yucky about it. The past week or so he made me feel like I owed him something, or like I was his property. He seems really delusional, and thinks that I'm secretly in love with him. I have to cut the friendship off now, because it's just sick and unhealthy. He is incapable of being someone I can chill with or talk to. When I say I'm alone, I really mean it.

I was cleaning trucker cum off of showers when suddenly this ragged older hippy lady confronts me as guests (we're trained to call them that. how lame.) often do. She was asking me if I knew anything about the credit card machine for the washing machines, a situation which arises more often than I'd like. I don't have time to deal with this shit.

 Well, this time I did for some reason. 
I call my manager back there to speak with her through the radio, and go about my business. As I'm folding piss, mucus, shit, vile fluid-stained towels, I overhear her talking about some top secret scheme the government has going against us. I keep at it, cleaning showers as usual. I've made up my own routine by now. The shortcut way, the efficient way, and probably not the most sanitary way is what I've adapted to using since time is always of the essence. If there are two guests waiting, I'm fucked otherwise. 
Well, she was once of the previous guests apparently. She stopped me again to tell me what a nice job I had done on cleaning the showers. They were ""beautiful"". 

Of course she saw everything that way. This woman was either on heavy amounts of drugs or just straight batshit insane. She went off on rants about ""the man"" basically, trying to shut us down with this shit jobs and prescription drugs, etc. (which I partially agree with, but that's a different matter). She went on to say how she was traveling with her friend who was a ""sensitive"". I asked what that is and she said he's someone who can actually sense events before they happen and such things. Apparently, they were traveling in a van together and stopped by my store because ""you guys always have clean showers"". She went on and on rambling about some wild shit about vibrations and feelings and sounds and various topics. Conspiracies mostly. Then she ended by telling me I'm a gem and capable of much more than cleaning showers. 

For a moment there I pondered over her statements to me, wondered if it was a sign, and thought seriously about getting my life together. Then I probably went home and took more xanax, bupe, and vaped dank. Such is (this) life. I'm so over and done with trying to bring an early end to myself. I have someone in my life who makes it worth living now. So, with her help I'm tapering one drug at a time until I'm off it all. Except some medical weed. If I have to jump in a van with hippies and live life on the road, then I will. Until next time, peace out opiate family.

A little background:

I am a victim of domestic violence, and for years now my partner has been pilfering my strips for his own abuse problems. Seeing as he pays for my treatment, every time I confront him about it, he threatens me with not paying anymore. I live in a rural area and there is only one seedy cash clinic nearby. Despite having 90/10 insurance, they won't even hear of taking it. 

I can usually work around this and mete out my doses out for the month but things just got out of hand with my partner's need to get high, and my refill isn't for another 10 days. My bottle is empty.

My usual dose is one 8/2mg strip 2x per day. Now, to my question: If I take a hefty dose of maeng da kratom, will that stop some of the withdrawal effects? I am calling my doctor tomorrow first thing, but for now this is my only option. 

I took the kratom on an empty stomach, along with 1 mg xanax (prescribed for panic disorder). According to the kratom bag, I took 6 grams.

7e3nce,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7e3nce/for_those_heavily_addicted_i_now_somewhat/,6,https://redd.it/7e3nce,Mr_J111,"For those heavily addicted, I now (somewhat) understand and fear I may end up going down that road.","For starters, I am dependent on Kratom (20g a day) for depression and knee pain. It does serve it's purpose for depression and body pain. Since it does have a binding affinity to the mu opioid receptors, technically, I guess I am already a (lightweight) mild opiate addict.

I suffer from PTSD and chronic anxiety (my ""excuse""). I am heavily addicted to benzo's (was a very heavy drinker but found benzos to be the lesser of 2 evils). I know that I would be in severe trouble if I was suddenly out of benzos...Anyway, to my point about which drugs do what for me.

Benzo's - My mind tends to race 1000 miles an hour. I over analyze every situation and expect the worst outcome. Wherever I go,  my mind is constantly scanning for potential danger and creating an exfil/ fight or flight plan if one of these scenario's do occur. Benzo's are not fun for me, they simply allow my mind to tell me ""woah, relax a bit bud, you don't have a bunch of people out to kill you"".


Psychedelics (particularly tryptamines) - Allow me to escape to another dimension and kindly explain to me what is wrong in my life. It will then tell me how I can go about fixing it and what it will accomplish.
 Purely educational for me and have been beneficial for giving me the courage to seek help and/or make the necessary changes in my life (which is still a massive work in progress).


Alcohol - I rarely ever drink now, but when I did, it was similar to benzos for me. Numb the pain and slow down life. I was never drunk, I drank steadily around the clock. Just enough to drown out the anxious feelings but enough to make me quite physically ill. I am convinced that had I not switched to benzo's, I would not have a liver. Sure I have had bouts of complete sobriety from everything for up to 4 months. It was honestly the worst 4 months of my life.


Stimulants - I am very fond of this class of drugs because they allow me to keep up with the pace of life and enjoy it (diagnosed adhd as well but suspect it is a co-morbid symptom of ptsd). I quite enjoy the often terrifying situations that come about and not only do I get a huge dopamine rush, but I also get shit done.


Weed - Allows me to relax a bit but I can't get anything done. I become creative and sex becomes much more enjoyable. I have only recently started smoking again (mostly indica) because it is a powerful tool that allows me to lower my benzo usage a great deal.


Opiates - I was always one to grab some percocets or oxy's when they were around. It was a nice way to spend the day kicking back and relaxing. It was very occasional and I never became addicted (unless Kratom counts).


Now the part that scares me.... About a week ago, I got some strong prescription opiates (I do not want to post exactly what atm) but it was enough for a weekend of nodding.


WOW! I was nodding for the first time and it was heavenly. For the first time in many years, I felt at peace, no worries about anything.
Sure, benzos help me slow down to a walking pace, but this.....This feeling allowed me to completely stop running or even walking. Instead I was able to just lay in the grass and relax without a care in the world.


I hit one state where everything seemed to be made of gold and my mattress was like lying on a heavenly cloud. I thought to myself ""this is it, this is the nod everyone talks about, it's quite possibly the most beautiful thing I've felt"". 


I continued dosing through Saturday and Sunday all day, it was absolute paradise. I did not have to worry about eating, work or doing anything. I even brought a big empty jug next to my bed to piss in because getting out of bed was work that was interfering with my nod.


That feeling; once it hit while smoking a cigarette and I could barely keep my head up: I can only describe as the brightest golden ray of sunshine warmly embracing me. Then, I knew it was time to go back to my cloud (bed) and not give a fuck about anything - Just enjoy the heavenly warmth of everything...Everything that is safe, beautiful and sacred around me. Music took on a whole new direction for me and was indescribably serine. I am now hooked on ""The Revivalists - Wish I knew ya"" because it was the most beautiful hymn to come from the heavens while in my golden state. Listening to it almost brings me back there.


As an addict, I already know how my addict brain works. It will do everything in it's power to have that feeling again and if I am not careful, I will be chasing the dragon everyday severely addicted to another substance. I know where that road leads and to become addicted to another substance will surely result in my demise.


After a week, my brain is somewhat trying to reason with me. It is telling me to go after that feeling again. It's the kind of feeling I want to have every 2 months when I have a weekend to do nothing. Sounds reasonable enough to me if I were to only use for a couple of days every 2 months right? Well...I guess I just fear my addict brain will take over. Those 2 days every 2 months will become 3 days every month eventually leading to every weekend and before I know it, the claws of addiction will once again have full control over me.


I can honestly say that I am not craving that feeling (well, maybe a bit) and can wait a few months to try again. Perhaps it's my addict brain trying to trick me. I guess I am not asking any questions, I am just posting my feelings. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, but hell. I can't wait for another couple of months to go by so I can have that feeling again.

TL;DR - I'm a poly substance addict (mostly benzo's and stims) and a recovering alcoholic with PTSD. I had my first taste of strong opiates and it was a better feeling than any drug I have EVER tried. Better than high quality coke, methamp, MDMA, ketamine, DMT, xanax, sex: It did not matter, nothing came close to that golden paradise of nodding.

I now understand.",1511127015.0

I have a big sack (250g) of Red Bali Kratom from Gaia Ethnobotanical. I also have a tiny bit of Gold MD but that's literally a gram worth. Can I mix the Gold MD with Red Bali?

&nbsp;

I'm fifteen hours from my last dose of dope. I feel surprisingly fine right now but expect to feel worse between tonight and tomorrow. I'm really surprised that I'm not being assailed by the cold chills but I expect that to occur eventually.

&nbsp;

**Should I wait until I start feeling stronger ill effects of opiate withdrawal before I start consuming Kratom?** I'm thinking of eating two grams straight at a time and no more than four or five grams in one sitting. I really hate the taste but I'm willing to get it down if it'll prevent me from feeling like total hell.

&nbsp;

Personally I'm more comfortable with 1-2mg doses of Suboxone but I'm willing to give Kratom another chance. I remember it worked one time for me before a work day. Another time I was using Kratom over the course of two days when I started getting intense stomach pains. It was suggested that I make tea out of it. The time I got the stomach pains, I was consuming Kratom inside of vegetable  gelatin capsules so I guess eating ten capsules in one sitting wasn't the best idea.  

&nbsp;

**P.S.- I'm more concerned about how many times per day to dose.** I just had a cup of hot chocolate mixed with Kratom. I used a tea infuser and compressed it after letting it steep in the hot chocolate.",1511123659.0

I took oxy a few times for my wisdom teeth surgery back a long time ago, and morphine for a broken collar bone in elementary school, but nothing since then, not even in college. The closest thing I'd say I do is kratom sometimes, but that's it. 

I am still very interested in opiates, addiction, and psychoactive substances in general. I've been reading through this sub for quite some time just lurking and have been pleasantly surprised by you guys. At first I expected just to see everyone talking about all their drugs, or what they were gonna take next (do see this some but no as much as I thought) but I saw kind of the opposite. 

You guys actually encourage each other to quit, and when someone posts here that theyre X days clean, you guys congratulate them and tell them to keep going. I'm not sure why I expected to see comments such as ""nah come back man. Heroin awaits!"" Or some shit like that, but I haven't seen that once. I guess it's because you all know better than anyone else how it feels, and I'm sure deep down everyone wants to quit or at least is thinking about it. I'm very surprised (pleasantly) that you guys are so supportive of each other and encourage to discontinue use! I figured the quitting opiates sub would be like that and that this one would be encouraging it. 

Not really too related to opiates overall, but just wanted to post this to let you guys know that from an outsiders point of view, I think this sub is great and encourages the right decisions! Keep it up guys. ",1511122371.0

Lost my baby, and it's all been downhill from there.","Two years ago I had a bad fight with my boyfriend that got physical, all my friends had just moved away to college and the only person I trusted was my cousin whos an addict. She brought her shit over and was prepping a shot for herself while we were talking and started pushing me to have some. I wasn't in my right mind because my boyfriend had been choking me the night before and I was trying to figure out what to do, but I did have experience with opiates. I used to take at least 25 Tylenol with codeine a night, and I figured if anything shooting one hydromorph would be safer than all the shit in the pills. So I let her talk me into it. I didn't like it much, didn't feel much either so really all it did was make me more curious. So I kept doing it.

A few weeks go by and I'm a full on addict, and hustling for my fix every day. Doing coke when I hung out with my cousin for fun, and fuck anything else I could get my hands on. I tried H a few times but I must have cooked the shit out of it or it was cut to shit because I never fell in love with it and was sure dillies were my DOC. After Christmas last year I got on methadone and I've been doing so well since then. I almost had all my carriesv(even though I still used the odd time it was just out of my system by sample day)

Then about a month ago I found out I was pregnant. I did all the right things. My boyfriend (same one as before) didn't want me to keep it, was pushing me to have an abortion. I knew if I did keep it I'd be doing it on my own, but my mind was made up. I'd decided I'd do it and I'd make it work because I already loved that little bean inside me more than I thought possible and it had only been a couple weeks.

Fast forward a few weeks and I just don't feel right, seems like my pregnancy symptoms have almost gone away and I'm getting worried. So I spend that day in the ER. They told me they couldn't come to a conclusion because I was only about 8 weeks but they couldn't find a heartbeat (although they said that could be positioning of the baby) but my HCG had also dropped by 8000 since the week before. I was told to return in a few days. I got home and six hours later I was stuck in the bathroom because I was bleeding so damn much, passing clots the size of my hand. I knew then for sure that I'd lost the baby. It was hard but I handled it alright, until 4 days later when I pulled my pants down to pee and there was a recognizable fetus sitting on the pad I was wearing. I just about lost it. In some ways it was good because I had my minute with the baby, in other ways it was really bad. Despite passing the fetus I continued bleeding for three weeks. All during this time I started using daily. At first for the pain, then to forget. 

Then at the three week mark I start having those big rushes of blood like I did that day I got home from the hospital with the big clots and everything except it was happening like every 15-20 minutes. I looked like a ghost. I couldn't even stand up anymore. There was something really wrong. So I was rushed to the hospital, they didn't even do an ultrasound they just looked at my blood work said I wouldn't make it through the night if they didn't do something and did an emergency d&c. This was kinda traumatic for me, and I got so angry at my body. The two things it's made to do are carry a child, and when it can't then get rid of all the products of conception. That's what my body is built for, but it couldn't do either of those things properly. I felt like less of a woman. I was so disappointed in myself, so angry at everything else too. 

I'd picked up heroin once before I went into the ER, a few days before and not much and I knew I'd get back on track, and I started to. But after being in the hospital and having the D&C I feel like I'm back to square one and have to come to terms with losing my baby all over again. All I've done since I've been home is use. I've picked up heroin multiple times, done more hydromorph than I can count. Today I even missed my methadone so I'd have an excuse to use more. So I went and spent $100 on heroin, and also picked up a hydro 12, and 4 8mg hydros. I know it'll all be gone by like maybe 2am at the latest but probably much earlier. I'm just really disappointed in myself. I'd come so far. But at the same time, I want to allow myself to grieve however I need to.

I thought I was going to get more support and the lack thereof in any kind of progress made me want to use more. So now I’m pretty much back to the basics: shitload of benzodiazepines, dope and a lil coke here and there.

So my question is: do you think we have to embrace our addiction fully in order to hope reaching sobriety?(basically getting rid of any guilt about using is what I mean)

It might seem counterintuitive but as I’ve never wanted so much to be sober I’m fucked up all the time and when i let go I seem to use way less...

The first injection was a 10mg morphine ampule pharmacy grade and the second times were oxycodone up to 75mg in one shot. Morphine felt like musles tensing up and the pins and needles sensation.

Dilaudid though felt similar to morphine but a lot more smoother and felt like just a sudden numbing and muscle's tensing and relaxing sensation. Mostly its a rush and after it basically there is nothing but still it is amazing and a much cleaner high than oxy. It feels natural. Being a metabolite of a hydrocodone it feels pretty much the same as hydrocodone to me. Oxycodone to me now is bad, too many side effects, in huge amounts shot up there is no rush but just a feeling of a come up and a slight numbing. Oxy feels dirtier too and like theres always a constant mental itch inside me.

Dillies feel more natural, cleaner, and I think are less mentally and physically addictive than oxy as well.

Do you wait until you're in the vein to pull the plunger back to see if you registered, or before you try to hit, do you leave a little air in the syringe near the tip so the blood just flows in and so you don't risk slipping out of the vein if it's tiny? (btw if there is a bubble in the syringe, you won't die lol... Old myth and it takes way more air than just a little bit to fuck you up). 

Do you always wash your injection site with alcohol pads or something of the sorts, prior to AND after injecting or do you choose to do one or the other, instead of both.. ?


Do you have a specific tie off or something of the likes that you constantly have on you? Or do you just use whatever the fuck you can (guilty as charged).

I always pull my tie off, off of my arm or from wherever before I pull the rig out of the vein I just shot into. I've heard it helps from letting blood pool up under the skin becayse of the pressure, but I'm not sure if it holds any value to it lol.

But yesterday he had us go somewhere completely different, and when we get off the interstate, I realise that we're really close to my hometown.

When we get to the spot we're supposed to wait at, my dad points out to me the road we're on. It's the actual fucking road that leads to our old house and everything. Memories start flooding in. I get lost in nostalgia.

Then my guy pulls through and says to follow him. We do, and end up doing the deal just a couple streets over from our old house. Un-fucking-believable. It felt so strange being on those streets again doing what we were doing. I never dreamed I would be back in that little city 15 years later scoring heroin. It was surreal. 

Anyway, after we do the deal, we go to the road that runs in front of the airport to sit and do our lines. We used to go there when I was a kid and sit on the hood or trunk of our car and watch the airplanes take off and land. Even spotted a UFO once hovering above the airport when I was about 9 years old.

So, we snort our lines and then decide to go and explore the old neighborhood and drive by our house, my old school, all the places I remember from my childhood. It was a nice little trip down memory lane for us. But it was also really bizarre to be there as an adult doing heroin right around the corner from my childhood home. My dad felt weird about it too because he used to take my mom to meet her crack dealer in the same area, so it was like some weird deja vu to him.

It was a good nostalgic experience overall, but also felt so fucking bizarre.",1511226669.0

Sweating, dilated pupils, achiness and trouble sleeping. 
I looked it up and there's no way that my symptoms lining up with W/D symptoms could be a coincidence. So tonight I took a 10 mg oxy, just to feel better.

Much better than subs in every way,"I'm done with oxy. Hate the feeling now. I only started it because it was hyped and my first experience with it in 2010 10mg produced and amazing euphoria. But overall hydrocodone has always been better.

Basically I snorted up to 240mg blues a day or IVD up to 3 blues In a shot.

IVing in the morning produces somewhat of a ""rush"" although it's very mild.

Subs are garbage.

But hydrocodone even a small amount takes away withdrawals and knock on wood I wake up the next day with no cravings for either.

Amazing that oxy and hydro are different by just a single oxygen atom that oxycodone has more yet the effects are vastly different. At least for me hydrocodone feels more ""natural"" and withdrawals are no where near as bad as oxy.

Hopefully this will keep me off blues forever. Done with oxy the high is garbage in retrospect anyway. Only liked it at first because I liked snorting things.

Now fuk opana too because it's a metabolite of oxycodone but I'm getting some metabolites of hydrocodone aka hydromorphone for Thanksgiving and gonna iv 3-4mg and have a great day.

It's odd even 40-50mg hydrocodone feels like 150-180mg oxycodone. Even 150mg tramadol a while back felt strong. New chemicals tend to always feel stronger for me because I'm not used to it. I'm tapering hydrocodone anywhere from 7-14 days with a few dilaudid shots in between 😇. Wish me luck.

But oxy, that I want done for sure no matter what..horrible drug that it makes me irritated, angry. Yell at friends or family sometimes and can't cum for shit. I can cum no problem even on 80mg hydrocodone and feel as high on that amount as 200mg oxy.

I have a 80mg Oxycodone daily habit. 5 - 8mg hydromorph's did the trick but I also ate 40mg of oxy along with it. 

Is there any advice you guys can give me for shorting rectally? What I did was crush up the pill and put it in the top of the oral syringe then put my finger on the bottom whole. I then put the plunger in untill the powder was compressed. Then I ""drew"" up a bit of water and flicked the oral synringe so it would mix, then I shot it into my asshole lol if that the correct way? It was my first time.

It's also worth noting that this is my first time actually getting faded/high off of hydromorphone. Every other time they sucked.

I made a massive effort this year to kick it for good and made it 6 months before a lapse and back on it around the end of July. I tried not to disappoint them and kept it a secret but I am useless at hiding it, they can see me high a mile away and I'm terrible at cleaning up paraphernalia etc.

Anyway, around September in an effort to make an effort - I was going for job interviews and somehow I managed to land an unbelievable job of a lifetime with incredible pay, amazing prospect and it is for one of the top 100 companies in the UK.

However, I was still using. A little in the morning to get through work unnoticed and a little in the evening to sleep.

They found out of course and I spent the last 2 weekends trying to go cold turkey and make it to work on Monday - failing every time. I have been forced to take a few days off work sick when unable to score - in the last 3 months of work, I've missed 10 days of work and my 'Bradford score' (score of how disruptive my taking sick time has been to the company) has surpassed the maximum allowed score of 100 and hit over 250!

I had to have a disciplinary meeting at work and I was asked if I'd been to the doctor (luckily I went to see if I could get help multiple times, so I have plenty of doctors attendance notes. The GPs and the Drug clinic have been FUCKING USELESS, to the point where I wrote a 15 page letter to my local Member of Parliament to complain about how hard it is to get help for drug issues if you aren't homeless and actually have a real job because the clinic is only open between 9-5pm weekdays. Useless for me. But the whole complaint about doctors, the government and drug help in the UK is in another monstrously long ranting post I made elsewhere!)

I'm now under review at work. I don't want to lose this job. (Rather amusingly, one of the questions my manager had to ask was 'Have I been drinking too much and do I have a problem, because I always seem to take Monday's off! I had to laugh.)

My mum came to me on my Birthday on Saturday and said - I can see you've been desperate to quit and put real effort into it, you haven't snuck off or stolen money, you've locked yourself in and been sick for days trying to kick it and just haven't had the time to complete the withdrawal. I don't want you to lose this job - it could be the ticket to the rest of your life if you can kick this awful habit. I agreed.

So, off her own back, she has offered to pay for as much dope as I need for the next month until I can get to Christmas, where I can book all the holiday I have coming to me at work and take 5 days, a weekend, Christmas and boxing day - a total of 11 days off. Which should easily be enough to kick it through the peak primary physical withdrawals enough to go to work afterwards unaided and just get better day by day from there. 

As long as I'm completely honest, don't take the piss (use too much) and make it another month until I have the time to quit properly, I'm supplied until then.

A totally fair deal if you ask me.

However, she insist I smoke it as she doesn't want me injecting. To be honest, I've run out of places that are easy to inject anyway so I had moved to boofing for the last week anyway. 

I've tried smoking it. It does stop withdrawals but there is NO hit, NO high and only seems to take the edge off. I still feel a bit hot and uncomfortable, but hey. It's better than nothing..

So.. Junkie Jesus rides in and saves the day for an entire month. I know I'll have to quit, but at least I don't have to panic every day knowing I need to get money, find a dealer and hide it from everyone.

This past weekend she drove me round 3 different dealers and we stocked up on hundred of quids worth of gear. It's all in my parents safe right now, I just need to ask for it when I need it.

I'd like to pin it, but if I miss or can't find a vein, it'll be a waste and I'll be forced to boof. If that doesn't work either, I'll be sick, so I do kinda have to stick to the plan and smoke it - they roughly know my schedule  of when I get sick (every 6-12 hours) so I can't ask for much more. If only I had veins left for this last month! Hey, maybe its a sign its time to kick this shit once and for good like I've been trying.",1511200594.0

The longest I’ve gone just laying in bed is 3 weeks and I feel like I’m well on my way to surpassing that now. 

I’m not using right now. Trying to not even drink. This seems to happen the hardest when I try to get sober. I like that I’m not using every day but it is obviously not a healthy trade off if the only thing I do when I’m not using is sleep and avoid the sun and people and the only time I’m energetic and productive is when I’m high.

Always seemed a bit risky to use anything other than oral drugs at work but it's just night and day the difference with morphine. So anyways I'm curious, what's your routine like with using and work and what do you to get your fix at work? ",1511339668.0

So I had over 8 months clean and sober and decided to relapse. Wasn’t going to get dope bc I’m on probation for another 3 months with urine tests often. I loved u4 tho before I got sober and honestly planned to chip, but we all know how that usually ends up. Anyways, got the u4 (4g of it) and waited til night time to use it. 

Drove to my local pharmacy to buy some saline nasal spray to help my sinus a little bit bc this shit is caustic. Decided to do a tiny bump of u4 in my car before going inside, to test the waters. I ended up doing 2 small little bumps without weighing anything out. I had taken bumps of it before but I was clean for 8 months prior and I had zero tolerance to opies at this point. I know this was stupid to do, but I thought I could handle it bc really they were tiny bumps, smaller than what I would do before wth other batches. This batch must have been way more potent.

I start feeling really good and begin to walk into the pharmacy to buy the saline. I quickly realized it was too much, it kept getting stronger and stronger as I go into the store and walk to the aisle with nasal sprays. I knew I took too much, I started to lose my balance and my vision started to go a bit blurry. 

I get to the cough/allergy aisle and look for the saline spray, but my vision got mor and more blurry and I couldn’t focus on anything and couldn’t see what I was looking for or read any text on any products. My balance got worse and worse to the point where I could no longer stand straight. From here my memory goes pretty cloudy.

I started swaying hard from side to side trying to stand straight. Bumped into the shelves behind/in front of me a few times. Ended up on my knees and knew I was fucked at this point and knew I had ODd.

Next thing I know there’s a bunch of paramedics around me calling my name. I was very confused and disoriented, it felt like I was dreaming. They loaded me onto a stretcher and started to take me out to the ambulance. I realized what was happening and was no longer confused, so I tried to get off the stretcher and tried to tell them that I refuse any treatment bc they said they were calling my mom and I’m on thin ice with her and I’m on probation so I didn’t want to be found out that I relapsed.

They said I was unconscious and not breathing for several minutes before they got to me. My heart rate was at 180bpm now and my mom showed up to the ambulance and they convince me to go to the hospital and get treated. I then spend a few hours in th ER and eventually go home, somehow thought of a lie to cover up using u4. Denied taking any drugs and even asked them to test me for proof (knowing u4 doesn’t show up on drug screens). 

Fucking shit...

My friend had found some old percocets he was prescribed in his moms cabinet, and i bought them all of him (he not into that). 

I tell my fiend friends and they’re all over me the whole day unti it’s 7th period and my friend and I decide to skip it the period. We escape the school and start walking to another friends house, who wasn’t there but he said he had some bud that we could take. 

He fucking lied to us and there was no bud and he said “his brother took it” (complete lie). Luckily I had some weed back home but it’s like a 45 minutes walk to there from where we were but we said fuck it and started walking. 

So he knew I had the percs on me (5 mg pills) and I had 4 of them. I thought I had 5 and I was planning on taking three and giving two to my friend, but after I took the three I noticed there was only one left so that confused me, but he didn’t really care so I just gave it to him. We popped em on the sidewalk and headed for my house.

I really started feeling it after about 35 minutes and I get the weed and we go back to his house to smoke. Laying down can enhance the opiate high immensely so I’m laying on the couch and I start to feel really good, much better than walking. We smoke and then lay back on the couch. Immediately after the hit, I felt super cloudy in my head and I couldn’t put any words together and could barely walk, and probably looked retarded in front of him cause he wasn’t as fucked up as me.

I lay on the couch and just pure euphoria hits me. Just simply staring at the window was pure bliss, one of the best highs I’ve ever had. Weed and oxycodone are a match made in heaven in my opinion. I was totally nodding hard and one second I was talking to him and the next I was asleep and he was like “dude are you okay” haha. 

Anyone else have experiences mixing opioids with weed good or bad?",1511329269.0

Been very busy lately and haven't been too active on here. Day 31 without heroin is wrapping up and day 32 begins in just a few hours. Today my thoughts seamlessly drifted into getting a point or two and just gettin high for the day. It'd feel great, I'd get to buy off my new friend, and I'm sure I have rigs hidden around here somewhere. Then tomorrow forget it ever happened. 

Then I thought myself, ""wait what the fuck am I doing. Bad recovering addict, bad recovering addict. No no."" It took a few tries to snap myself out of it. Heroin is a bad bitch, which I'm unfortunately into, but she has some hooks, that's for sure. Seems today those hooks gave me the room I needed to feel a little comfy and let my guard down then BOOM that bitch tryin to snag me again. Don't get me wrong, thoughts of using cross my mind all the time, as I expect so early in recovery. But I was seriously and genuinely considering it today and it was so easy to get caught up in it without noticing, seemed like any old smooth flowing thought process. Blended right in. 

It's fucking terrifying. You guys I seriously cannot let myself touch that shit again, and realistically the odds are completely stacked against me. Like fuck. I've been around it a good few times since this go at getting off the junk, had it offered, even stuck in my face. Everytime I was 100% on the nope nope nope boat, and told that person I'm not for it anymore don't ask again. Today seemed really different. I know I didn't do anything wrong, I didn't get high, but I see this as a red flag and something that stands out and I want to know what to do.",1511327777.0

I’ve used this sub a lot for info on opiates and dosages and whatnot and i would like to share my story for others to be wary/ compare stores. So pretty much my opiate usage started in January of this year. My dad had had severe back injuries and therefore accumulated thousands of Norco (hydro10/apap325). I started small, few at a time nothing crazy as to have my dad not notice but after a while, ran out and stopped for a while. One day upon searching i found a large large storage of pills my dad had hidden and went to town. I quickly ended up 24 pills a day for about 3 months until i ran out. As i was running out my parents discovered my usage and talked to me and since i was out of pills it was time to stop. Now there were still some left that i was going to use on occasion when home from college. This happened multiple times and went well taking around 10 pills and having it go alright. Well, last Friday night i had taken 10 norco 3 oxy snorted and 3 tramadol. Next thing i know I’m in the hospital apparently I had puked while knocked out, inhaled the puke, had cpr done on me, and ambulanced to the emergency room. 4 days later, i am still in th hospital recovering from my pneumonia. My time here has been alright but the psychiatrist lady had been pissing me off trying to tell me what i think and feel and not believeing me when i tell her I’m not severely depressed. I’m being sent to outpatient paychiatric help. This is completely unnecessary because 1. I had no intention to harm anyone or myself it was a complete accident 2. It was a 1 time dose and I’m not hooked at all. This is a long story but I’d just like to share with everyone here thanks !",1511317767.0

 Fuk blues. Overrated and expensive garbage with a weird mental high that ha me agitated and absolutely can't cum plus you can't really get a rush  from banging and also it's a lot more addictive and harder to get off than hydromorphone or hydrocodone.

Look at the news and the country. What are they mostly addicted to when it  comes to  opiates?

Number 1 is dope and number 2 is oxycodone and number 3 is probably hydrocodone but it's so far down from oxy and dope by miles. I don't know the hype of oxy. I started doing oxy because of the hype over norcos and you could snort it without apap and got terribly dependent and addicted.

I can safely say and knock on wood that hydrocodone and dilaudid don't make me crave the next day plus thr come down us so amazing. Oxycodone come down feels like shit and just overall very bad which is why people are so terribly hooked on it.

Im glad to be off it.

I still don't fully understand if, how and precisely why my ""friend"" Cliff screwed me out of $190 the night of pay day. At this point I'm just assuming he pulled some kind of shenanigans because it's in his nature as established by his track record.


&nbsp;

I'd like to take a moment to Chronicle the day this happened with a higher level of precision. I owed 15 blues to Cliff on Thursday's pay day so I pulled money from the ATM, and Cliff went to his guy to get 20 blues. He gets 15, I get 5. Some times he'll snort one blue but other times during this day he'll snort two at the same time as I've observed twice.


Later that evening, I'm on my way home from work and I answer my phone where he presents a proposition. For the days leading up to pay day and the week prior he kept mentioning how he has a friend who has a Suboxone script. This friend no longer uses dope but has a brother who does. The Sub connect would sell us a bunch of subs at a discount as long as we bought at least 20. 


&nbsp;


Being that I had $190 left after buying the blues and settling my debt from the days prior with Cliff I was planning on spending no more than $100 on subs. I didn't care about getting a bulk discount since even five subs would last me quite a while especially if I tapered down between this and next week. On the days leading up to pay day Cliff kept mentioning about his friend and the bulk discount and how it would be great to have all of these subs for the holidays. It's an easy sell because he knows I put importance on not being dopesick when visiting family on Christmas as an example.


**Sidenote** - Last Christmas I made a spreadsheet to ensure that I did not run out of dope when visiting my relative's house for a feast.

&nbsp;


Okay so that Thursday evening on pay day after already copping I put forth my last $190. I get 1/2 a bun and Cliff indicates that he bought two more buns to give to his sub connect who would in turn give those two buns to his brother. Come Friday afternoon he claims that the sub connect's brother came over at 7AM to pick up the 2 buns of dope (the sub connect was originally supposed to show up at that time) with the promise that the sub connect would show up later.

&nbsp;

By the time I showed up on Friday afternoon to get the bad news Cliff was laying in his bed as he does on days when he runs out of dope and is experiencing the early stages of withdrawal. So at first I thought maybe his BS story was true because he didn't have enough time to do two buns and get dope sick. 


Heck, even his text messages on Friday morning were in sync with the appointed times. It appeared as though he did stay up and wait for his friend to deliver the subs. 


* 6:30AM - ""he's coming"" 

* 7:30AM - ""he's coming shortly I'll alert you when he does.""

* 11:00AM - ""He'll be here before one, I lost it on the phone before. My mother was so scared because I SNAPPED at him and we ARE getting extra.""

* 12:30 PM - ""I'm waiting ofr him now I'll text you when it's here""

* 1:15 PM -- Upon me asking if the guy is enroute, response is: I hope so he said a few minutes after 1pm and I just asked as you texted me""

* 2:00 PM -- I ask again if he's coming, ""wiating for that answer""

* 2:02 PM - ""His last text he said he left his house""

* 2:27 PM - After more of my short inquiring, ""I have window open I'm just closing my eyes til he arrives. He's coming in when here dont' worry""

* 2:28 PM - ""I'm pouring sweat""

* 2:29 PM -- ""ok well I'll either have a bunch of subs or a bun if he don't show"" (at this point it's my understanding that Cliff is still hodling on to 2 buns of H as part of the trdade for the subs)

* 2:30 PM - ""He's shwoing I'd bet my bun on it ! Did you take your last bit of sub?"" (I had less than 1mg of sub left, I did take it and wasn't going to shate it anyway -- I shared 1mg of sub with cliff the other day an hour before his dboy delivered, had I not I woudl've had 2mg of sub!)

* 2:31 PM - ""I'll be texting you shortly watch""

* 3:15 PM -- I say I can't believe there's no update. Cliff responds, ""I'm waiting anxiously trust me""

* 3:17 PM -- I state that I'm giving it until 5pm then I'll come thru in person for an update. Cliff says, ""ok I'm praying and will text you before then""

* 3:28 PM -- I indicate that I'll arive after I take a shower. His response, ""text me before you come please""

* 4:29 PM - **""I fucked up dude. We have to decide what to do.""** In my mind, fuck... This.

Maybe I'm a smug asshole but my response to that was ""Well, admission is the first step. I'll be over soon I'm getting dressed."" Then finally I indicated I Was on my way.

&nbsp;

Upon my arrival Cliff says ""the sub connect's brother came at 7:30AM, picked up the dope."" He also indicated that the Sub connect stopped answering his phone at 2:30 PM. Now based on the text messages listed above, there is no indication that the sub connect's brother came to pick up the dope so it's hard to believe it as truth.

&nbsp;

There didn't seem to be enough time to do 15 blues + 2.5 buns. He only picked up the H Thursday evening on the same day he picked up 15 blues. Even if he burned through all 15 blues by 9PM It's difficult to believe.

Maybe a good part of the money went towards paying for thanksgiving dinner to get his mom off his back?


&nbsp;

I cant' be certain if I was lied to or not, but in the past Cliff said that he was in contact with a sub connect but when I went to speak to that sub connect they said ""no, he has not messged or called me at all about needing to get subs."" So that time I spent my money on dope for him and I with the understanding that he had money set aside for subs but he did not. Due to that instance of lying and others before it... even in this situation where It's really hard to figure at what point in time he engaged in foul play I feel inclined to exercise caution and to look out for myself.

&nbsp;

When Cliff gave me the bad news on Friday in person, he gave me $20. He calimed that he, ""found it in my other pocket.""


On saturday morning he asked for the money back to buy dope on credit that he'd share with me. I insisted on not doing that but I couldn't guarantee being able to get subs that day and since he already called the house phone I went ahead and gave the $20 back just to quiet him. Coincidentally, his dope guy delivered at the same time the sub connect asked me if I needed anything.


&nbsp;

Took the off work on Saturday then found a way to earn subs on Sunday. At that point I didn't share because I want to make sure I can get through a long week which includes Black Friday in retail. 


Sometimes I think he's allergic to subs. Today and yesterday he's asking if I had any luck in getting subs yet. I keep lying and giving postponements as he has done to me in the past. 


I don't get it.... but my best buess is he has no foresight and is selfish. Doesn't do the logical thing of getting subs for after a dope binge until it's too late. Suddenly he cares about getting subs whem all other options for getting dope are exhausted.


&nbsp;

It's bullshit like this that has me at wit's end, and is the reason why I scheduled an appointment to see a doctor to put this lifestyle behind me. I refuse to be conned out of my money before Christmas. I need to buy presents for family members and not have to lie through my teeth. I also need to invest in upgrades for my ride.


&nbsp;

I provided a detailed account of the messages from Friday morning and afternoon to see if there's anyone who thinks I was **not** scammed. I'm assuming I was based on history but if not for that I would've believed in his story and given a portion of any subs I obtained this week.",1511295266.0

I wanted to be sober for a trip to Iceland I was taking for a variety of reasons - I was going to be alone with my family for the first time in a year, I was going to be experiencing something I didn't want to forget, I didn't want the hassle of traveling with illegal shit - you get the point. 

But the day I got home I dosed. I fucking got home, brought my suitcase up the steps and went to the medicine cabinet. I stared at the pills for maybe 30 seconds wondering what the fuck I was doing. I poured a pill into my hand, stared a little longer and then tossed it back. 

Since then I've been on a binge, back to 90mg of roxy or more a day. Fuck it feels so good. God damn I hate how good it makes me feel, how nothing - *nothing* can make me feel that way. Nothing makes the anxiety and depression go away, nothing helps me sleep better. I hate this drug but mostly I hate how much I love it. I hate how much I feel like it ""helps"" me.

So now my plug is dry and I'm back on day 2 of sobriety. Fuck my life how can the w/d be worse after a 3 month binge than a full year of use? But it is. It's worse. 

Plug says I'll have 25 pills tomorrow, which will be day 3. I'm telling myself I'll try not to dose but the truth is I know I'm going to fucking eat them as soon as I have them in my hands. And then what?

I happened to be crossing the street to go to the liquor store that's right by my complex. I see a girl I recognize on the way back. Someone who I know is best friends with my old manager who I'm very close with. She and I start bitching about the ""new"" manager. Douche fuck stole some of my pills about a year ago. I tell her that and we're just having a lil bitchfest. So next day I'm walking and doing God knows what at my complex, I can't remember. I see my maintenance guy. He's probably the kindest person you'll ever meet. He has child that is special needs like mine so he and I talk a lot. We start talking about something and the neighbor comes up. He trips out because she had told him the story about the manager steal pills and my maintenance guy makes a joke that he'd ask to buy them.  We laugh and then start talking about how his brother just died and he's trying to figure out to get him cremated. I know someone people who know what to do. So I tell him I'm gonna look it up for him. An hour later I knock on the door to a unit he's remodeling and have all the  details he needs to have his brother cremated. Dude gives me a big hug and cries. Let me paint you a picture of this man. He's maybe about 5'10, thick grayish blond beard, bandana, rides a beautiful red bike not sure the maker, and he's friends with hells angels. But he will give you the shirt off his back or he'll shoot the shit with you, and he loves kids and his wife has authored a children's story. He also is a smart ass who sends his ex child support of $666 every month. I fucking adore this guy! I've known him for 4+ years. He asks me if he owes me anything  aka ""pills"". I tell him no, that I'm ok right now but if ever comes a time where I need to buy some maybe he can help.  This last week I needed to get some, sure enough my guy comes through and helps me out. Makes a joke not to tell anyone, I tell him you don't tell on me I won't snitch on you 😉 he catches my husband in passing a lil later and asks if we have any coffee. I walk my lil ass over there with steaming hot coffee and some creamer. He asks me again if he owes us anything. I tell him, ""no, We're friends and you don't owe us anything. I don't charge my friends. But keep me updated on the situation with your brother, because I care."" 
I kid you not, the next day he knocks on my door and hands me a signed copy of the book his wife wrote. I already absolutely love it!

I still had 2 in my dresser for cotton shots for a rainy day, and I was also planning on doing some speedballs during my few days off from everything during thanksgiving week though. So they've been there for a while. On monday I went on a 3 day road trip and got back yesterday to see that they've been completely cleared. So my mother went through my things whilst I was away. Now she hasn't brought anything up yet and she probably won't, but obviously I can't really asked what happened to them. If she does bring them up I'm gonna act like I forgot about that and haven't touched them since my last falling out. Which is mostly true btw, I haven't IV'ed since (not even cotton shots) and I did forget about them for like a week afterwards but after finding them again I decided I was going to keep them for cotton shots and an eventual speedball.


I was really looking forward to doing some speedballs though so I guess I'm gonna have to dig up Mr.kitties insulin needles from the little sharps container and use one of those.....oh well.


Happy thanksgiving y'all.

Suboxone has a habit of forming an extremely fast tolerance and the benefits do not last and you will constantly have to go up. This is what the doctor wants. I take my dose every 1-2 days as it has an extremely long half life and gets me by through withdrawl for at least up to 4 days.

Secondly less is more. If you want to feel good (not necessarily high) but GOOD stick within the range of 1-3mg as this allows more the antagonist effects to be more present allowing its positives to be felt much stronger and for some people like myself to get even anti depressant/anti anxiety properties out of this medication

Lastly do not let the doctor determine your schedule or sucker you in. Your recovery is up to you and the steps you take to get better are on your time depend on how YOU feel. Remember that majority of these doctors are pharma slaves and want to as i say ""pharmafuck"" you.

Downers have my heart. They make the anxiety go away. Realistically I can't snort heroin forever. I'm either going to die or ruin everything in the process. The sad thing is that that's not a dramatic statement. Money for rehab, my education is over, I'll get kicked out, no way to support myself, or worse go to jail. It's a never ending cycle. I can't cope sober. When I'm high it's the only time life is manageable. ",1511413609.0

It makes it always feel like I get 2 distinct rushes off of every dose: the first when I snort a few nice bumps of ECP, which is pretty high quality (I have a very low tolerance) and the second when I take a few nice bong rips an hour or so later. 


It's almost funny how amazing synergistic they are, usually when I smoke weed on dope, I basically just feel even higher on dope with a slight touch of that weed psychedelia, which is a really nice addition to heroin's otherwise not trippy euphoria. 


Actually the way I sometimes describe heroin to people is ""if you could isolate the euphoric component of weed, and amplify that while taking away the psychedelia, that would be heroin."" I've always felt weed euphoria, in it's purest sense, is very similar to opiate euphoria. Cannabinoids actually are opioid receptor positive allosteric modulators too so this isn't just something I'm making up. 


Anyway I have to have weed every single time I have dope, but then again I have to have weed all the time anyway. I'm a weed addict first and foremost. An opiate addict is something secondary to that and always has been for some reason.

My response:","You get into a serious medical emergency. You need surgery and won't be able to walk again for the rest of your life without excruciating pain. You're prescribed pain medication for several years and it helps. But after a few years you start to notice you keep upping your dosage. You have to take more and more in order to feel better. 

Sometimes you forget your pills at home and start to feel like you're catching the flu within 12 hours of not taking them. 

You go to your doctor and tell them the medicines not working anymore and that something needs to change. And then the doctor tells you that he can't give you anymore pain medication. The government is cracking down on overprescribing to prevent black market sales so they have to cut your prescription. 

You go home that night in a panic. You have a life. A job. A home. A family. Bills. How will you work without your pain meds to help you through your day? 

Within 24 hours you're experiencing the worst flu of your life. Your entire body is hot and cold at the same time. Your back and legs feel like they've been shattered apart with sledgehammers. You're vomiting constantly. You can't eat or drink for days. Your skin feels like it's crawling around your body.

Then one of your friends messages you. Hey I have something that will make you feel better, it's heroin. It's the same thing that's in pain medications it's just a stronger version. 

You, laying there in agony at 3 am after 4 days of not sleeping more than 25 minutes. Dehydrated and unable to eat a drop of food. 

""I'll feel better? I can go back to work? I won't lose my job? My pain will go away?"" 
You accept, and your friend shows up shortly afterwards. 

You try it. 

Suddenly within seconds. You're able to eat. You feel like you could sleep for days. You call your work to let them know you'll for sure be there in the morning. You crawl out of bed. The sun is shining. Your skin is warm. Nothing has ever made you feel so happy. So great in your entire life. 

You eat a big dinner with your family, kiss your wife good night. And then wake up again the next morning feeling the exact same way you did before. 

You told your work you'd be there. If you miss today you're certainly going to be fired. Your stomach in knots. Your back radiating pain harder than you've ever experienced in your life. 

You call your friend again. 

""I need more of that. That drug. It helped me. It made me feel better. I have to work today. If I don't I can't pay my bills everything will fall apart."" 

""Okay,"" he says. ""Be there in 15."" 

You count the minutes pass. Each second seems like a minute. Each minute an hour. Every second that passes you feel worse and worse. 

He gets there. You score. You take more heroin. You feel better. Your doctor won't give you more pain meds. Your body can't function without this drug. Heroin fixes this problem. You need it. You start being unable to afford it. Your wife finds a needle. She leaves with the kids. You go through detox. You relapse. Your wife divorces you. Your family disowns you. 

You just want to feel better. Heroin makes you feel better. 

You're homeless. Your wife and kids are gone. Your job is gone. Everything's gone except heroin. 

Your doctor prescribed you medications and got you hooked without you being fully educated then took it away from you. Your body cant function without that drug. You just wanted to feel better. You just wanted to not be sick. You just wanted to be normal. Now you've lost everything. Your entire life is gone. All you have is heroin.

We were sitting there, just talking, over a jack/coke sitting at the bar, killing time until it was time to throw the lines for them. He was one of my best friends in high school, we spent a lot of time that night reminiscing over those times. 
We get back to the boat, get our minds right & just continue to talk, laugh & bullshit around. Around 11, we jumped over to a different boat & done some of this random guy we just mets coke. After sitting there for a few hours, we decided it was time to part ways and get them out of the harbor. The last image I have of him is looking into his eyes & telling them to have a safe trip, tight lines. He said I love you bro, I'll call you when we come in to pack out. 

I never knew that 24 hours later, a 50 pound block, hanging 30 feet above the deck, was going to hit him in the head, killing him instantly. This is why it's called deadliest catch. While t.v. portrays it to be the PNW crab fishery, it's actually all east coast fisheries. Shrimp, ground fish & sea scallops are the top 3. Not only does the water want to kill you, the equipment we use does too. This is what you don't hear about. It's not all drugs, money & pretty scenes. While he died doing what he loved, it's still tragic that he did. Even though we understand there is a risk of us not coming back, we always figure it will be from our boat going down, not our equipment. 

To the many lines we did, the fish and shrimp we caught, the beers we drank, the laughs we shared, cheers brother, I love you. Rest in peace.

7eues4,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7eues4/5_years_since_we_lost_her/,1,https://redd.it/7eues4,Tee416,5 years since we lost her...,"This weekend marks 5 years since I lost my best friend  to an ""accidental morphine overdose "". I put it in quotation marks because 5 years later I still have a hard time believing she would  have taken that many morphine. She had  been on pain meds over half her life due to a horribly  painful genetic  disorder  she had, Ellers Danlos syndrome,  that made her connective tissue like bubble gum, instead of like a rubber band,  like it should have been. I lost count of how many times I had to pop her dislocated shoulder back in, or her finger (s). It was horribly  painful for her, and she was on opana for it. 
But yet she died from an overdose of her boyfriend's  morphine pills, what was termed ""30 times the therapeutic dose"" in her body. 
2 weeks after she died, her boyfriend moved her skanky babysitter in (the babysitter  was a minor when  my bestie died, the boyfriend  literally moved the whore in ON her 18th  birthday). I just can't let go of the feeling of how shady  and fucked  up it is that the only 2 people who know what really happened-the  boyfriend and the babysitter-hooked up right after she died. My bestie was on Opana for fuck sake, she would never  have wasted time taking his morphine.  I talked to her the night before she died , she asked if I knew anyone that would buy any, but she even said that she knew chances were slim anyone would. (This was at the peak of the pain pill influx,  before a lot of ppl switched to heroin).
I'll never forget waking up that Sunday to my phone ringing,  it was my besties sister,  so I silenced it and rolled back over. When she called back and left a message,  I got up to check it. 
The message said ""It's Jessica, please call me. Lindsy is dead"".
That's all I remember.  My mom said she heard me start screaming and I hit the floor. It was a nightmare,  a horribly  real nightmare.  
In the 6 days between when  she died and her funeral I took over 100 bars, just to keep myself moving and to try to not lose it completely.  
It's been 5years but it feels like it was yesterday.  She was my best friend,  I lost a piece of myself that day. I know she would be so pissed to see the addiction I ended up with, but after she died I went from selling pills, to eating them. 
I'm not sure why I shared this...I just miss her SO fucking much
 Been crying all day. I hate this week. Fuck Thanksgiving.  Think I'll go do a shot. 
Everyone call your best friend RIGHT NOW and tell them you love them, please. You might not get another chance. I wish I had one more chance to tell her. 
RIP Linds.....I Love and miss you",1511385870.0

7eu2th,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7eu2th/seriously_hydromorphone_dilaudid_feels_exactly/,7,https://redd.it/7eu2th,Daveslaine,Seriously hydromorphone (dilaudid) feels exactly like Hydrocodone (norcos),"Both have the same warm, content, natural high that feels like everything is just so peaceful and perfect. Not only that, but it's (knocks on wood to prevent jinxing himself) not even addictive IV compared to JUST ORAL OXY. And I'm not even talking about snorted oxy just oral.

Hydrocodone breaks down in the body to hydromorphone and even though you cannot IV pure hydrocodone you can IV it's metabolite.

Got a good night's sleep from like 12:30am to 1020am and woke up and slammed 8mg dilaudid and boy was the rush so amazing. The stronger your dose the stronger AND longer the rush.

Then the high is just like a cleaner version of hydrocodone with some of the slight itchiness and euphoria of morphine but not the dirtier High morphine has.

I guarantee in this forum everyone either defends to life either dope or oxycodone and some will say well oxymorphone is cooler but let's be honest, dilaudid and hydrocodone feel the same except hydromorphone can be IVd and has the best rush.

You know how everyone says they started with hydrocodone and can't really feel it anymore and that hydrocodone was the best High they had at first? Well try IV dilaudid for a few days and you'll get that same feeling back and more. 

Oxycodone has a high that is best snorting d and feels like a kind of stronger, noddier, but paradoxically speedy high that makes you unable to sleep and does give you energy and definitely takes pain away very good. You cannot cum on it at all. The high however is very mental and literally takes control and can even change your attitude or behavior. It's also amazingly addictive and cravings to do more is high. And the high is I wouldn't say dirty but doesn't feel clean either. It honestly is closer to heroin than hydrocodone.

But dilaudid is just like Hydrocodone with the BEST RUSH compared to any opiate including heroin and while the high lasts like 3-4 yours you have to do higher doses for more length.

I love waking up knowing I don't even have to do it anyway it's just not as mentally and psychologically addictive like oxycodone or heroin. Plus it got me off blues and much  better than the most garbage opiate ever, suboxone.

Anyway who else here love IV Dilaudid? Anyone else notice the similarity in feeling between hydrocodone and dilaudid? It's the same warm, natural, contentment body high which allows you to function in your mind as if you were sober plus even 16mg dilaudid give it 2-3 hours and I can still cum huge on my irlfriend without effort.

With oxycodone I didn't cum for weeks. Just fuking 30mg of it I could not cum for like 8 hours because it literally hijacks your brain control of your orgasm..

So, i wrote a... well, a depressing post a while ago and a lot of you kinda talked me through it and talked me out of it, and i wanted to say thanks

I know i come here sometimes to talk bad shit with you guys... I don't want to explain why i talk the bad shit, not unless someone PM's me because i honestly do not want to upset anyone.

You're all amazing people, high or sober... 

So, this is the emotional/Corny part, so stop reading unless you wanna see pure sappyness

I'm an amateur MMA fighter, and some people know of my struggle with chronic pain, and painkiller use (which im sure alot of people here are very well aware of). If there was a way that i could help everyone here, whether it's through free suboxone (i got a bunch incase i wish to stop my painkiller use, which i am unable to), or just someone to talk to.

My goal in life was to make it to the UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship), and i promised my (now dead, RIP Grandma) grandma that i would make her proud... If i make big money, then i want to make a way to give out free suboxone to those that need it (im very uneducated with opiates, so if i said anything misleading or wrong, feel free to correct or berate me.).

I've had so many friends die due to opiates (I live in melbourne, we have a problem with opiates), and it can sometimes hurt to come here and see people inject and stuff.. but i suppose life shouldn't revolve around what i want to see.

Also Setraline question insi,"So, went to the dr trying to get him to prescribe me some gabapentin for depression and anxiety because it helps massively. Makes me feel great, happy, talkative, mentally strong and positive.  I've been feeling depressed for about 7-8 years since i was 19-20 but have never done anything about it because i wasn't really sure if i was depressed or not. 

Like probably most on here that was the huge attraction to opiates because they take away the depression etc and leave me feeling happy and content. Anyway i so go in and explain my symptoms and ask about Gaba script, to which he became instantly defensive and dismissive. I explained i had a friend of who was given it by his Dr, along with some other things for his depression. He gave me a couple to try and it really helped! I thought i had found the solution. So I explain all this, but he was a total dickhead and really rude. tried to play it off like they don’t prescribe it for that when i know for a fact they do. Anyway he left me with a 2 week script for an anti depressant which i’m not sure about taking. He kept trying to rush me out of his office too when i wasn't done talking or asking questions.

After getting up and thanking and saying goodbye, he didn't respond and instead just slammed the door in my face. So i complained about him to the reception and had them make a note to never have me see that Dr again. 

Its sertraline he gave me FYI. I've always been unsure about SSRI's because you hear of people having crazy side effects and the fact that it takes months to come off once you are on because they have to do a very slow taper. Anyone have any experience with this?

Anyway, is there any advice on how to get myself a gaba script? Its like i'm being forced to go back to deep web to get what i need, when i should be able to get it from my doc when i describe the ways it helps massively.

Sorry for the long post, but i would appreciate any feedback or thoughts!

I found out weed wasn't bad, and that cigarettes short term weren't that bad, so I assumed the same went for heroin.","
I never learned the difference between soft and hard drugs. Educating children on this is so important. We often do what we're told not to do but maybe if we learned in detail the psychological effects and PAWS that opiate addiction can cause, it would be a deterrent. Because it's not like the movies (5 days of WD then you're Gucci) nope! 

My curiosity often trumps my fear. I feel like I was doomed. Granted my ex (who was an excellent chipper, part of the 1% as I like to call them) introduced me. (Heroin found me not the reverse, it's the only detail in my story that I'm sort of proud of that I always mention, it gets me a little sympathy, pathetic and twisted eh?) My naïveté was the reason I didn't ""just say no"". Education is so important. These stigmatized subjects such as drugs, mental health and sex are the ones we should discuss the most. How did you encounter heroin?

Also seriously what kind of piece of shit introduces someone to opiates just fuuuck. If you've done this you gotta at least regret it. 

At the end of the day it was my mistake my decision and I'm a stupid ass.  And sure I'm having a bit of a pity party and it was my fault blah blah but I think it's interesting to explore the reasons we make the decisions that we make. But we do not *start out* as a junkie.

 Most of the time we don't one day wake up and watch a movie with drug content and be like ""fuck yeah I wanna be like THAT"" Then put on a grungy outfit ( or like ghetto ass hood ensemble that comes with guns that you never use [but constantly threaten to use on people]and complimentary fake gangster accent)then proceed to blast nirvana (or rap whatever your personal preference may be) while driving through the hood, cop, laugh maniacally like we don't care about anything, then shoot up in a McDonald's parking lot. 🙄 if this is your story then I don't even know what to say. 

Short story: we have to educate our children about WHY drugs are bad and the huge difference between soft and hard drugs. I didn't have this luxury. No one starts off as a junkie no one is ""just a junkie"" or inherently bad. I don't know I'm stoned ",1511373924.0

I've done this before, so I'm not completely naive about the game, and I'm usually very cautious. 

I got an order from someone I've known for some time, who knows almost everyone I know who uses. He told me he had $40 and gas money (because when I deliver I charge for gas money). 

It took me some time to get to him because it was rush hour and I'm in a major city. He wasn't where he usually is, but a few miles further out. 

When I arrived, everything was normal. He hopped into the front passenger side of my car and told me where to take him (just inside the gate of an apartment complex). 

He started going through his pockets, looking for his cash. He pulled out a dollar and said, ""I have more,"" looked a bit more, pulled out an envelope with some change in it, and poured the change all over the center console in my car. Then he pulled out a large silver coin and said, ""This is about $30."" I looked at it, but I knew I couldn't take it. So after a minute or so, he says, ""I'm gonna need that 40."" I tell him I'm not keeping his coin, so I can't give him the piece. 

I put in a call to my plug, with him sitting in my car. I didn't want there to be any doubt that I had actually asked if they would take the coin. They told me if he wanted to go to a pawn shop and then buy the piece, that would be fine, but no way was I to take this coin as payment. I hung up the phone and told him what they told me. He didn't get out of my car, and I was just about to say, ""Okay, I need to go,"" when out came the knife. 

Before I had a chance to react, his arm was around my neck and there was a blade being held to my throat. He said, ""I'm gonna need that 40. I got you tomorrow. Is that okay?"" and I said, ""Yes...it's fine."" because what other option did I have? I handed him a cigarette pack with the piece in it, he got out of my car, and walked away. 

I was stunned. I didn't know what to do, other than to get out of there, so even though I was shaking and crying, I started to drive back toward my house. 

I know this dude uses reddit, and I know almost every junkie in town knows him. I'm just not sure how to get the word out that he is not some innocent kid who can be trusted or is deserving of sympathy. He's a fucking monster who will hurt you over a very small amount of drugs. 

Oh, and of course he never paid me the $40. So not only did he cause me emotional trauma and physical harm (a small knick to the neck from his knife blade), but he also fucked up my finances.

[Description](https://imgur.com/gallery/a19Yv)

So now I have this incredibly shitty disease called [empty nose syndrome](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729612000312)

I have ongoing incredible pain from breathing and this frightening and insidious feeling of suffocation. These feelings never go away and get worse when I exert myself. 

Opiates help me cope, so I take them now. Without this medication I probably would have killed myself earlier this year. The pain is unimaginable. 

I'm scared when I hear about placing new regulations on prescription pain killers, or when healthcare providers label people ""drug seeking"" or tell me ""opiates are the wrong medication"" for empty nose syndrome, even though there is no medication and no cure, and it's the only thing that helps. 

I feel like I have to constantly take fiber rich foods to avoid constipation too.

Anyway, I'm suffering pretty bad and I'm glad I have access to these drugs. The medical industry is just so corrupt and dangerous, I almost can't believe it. 

I'm glad I'm alive, but if I didn't have these medications I wouldn't want to be. Every breathe hurts and every activity that makes me breathe harder exponentially increases my pain. 

Anyway, thought I'd share some of my pain, and thank other forum participants for supporting people's access to pain medication. Thanks guys.",1511526598.0

I found myself buying a crafting blade last night with intentions of cutting. 

I don't know why I went back. I haven't had urges in years. Im not going to make it a problem though. I'm completely off my meds (antidepressant and mood stabilizer) and have been for about three weeks now. I think I'm starting to feel the effects of that, leading me to  this. I got into a fight with  someone I care about, love maybe. I was told I'd   my stuff back and then we wouldn't talk or see each other anymore. I panic. We apologize. We understand we're both half asleep. I take blame for freaking out. I wanted to talk about it but he falls asleep. 

I'm alone.

I rail my last four bags at once. Never done so many like that. I don't feel pain  now, it's been about ten minutes.

.
This is similar to registering your shot in a sick way. You watch the ident of pressure on your arm either stay the same (which indicates the actual blade side was not used) or fill and bead up with blood.

It just didn't hurt. Usually it stings as the skin tears, usually it hurts. That's dimorphine for you. That could be dangerous though. I had no way of knowing or feeling how feel deep I'm going

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish.

I'm finally going to get my life back, right? Ha, no! Turns out that stuff triggers horrific migraines. The doctor acted like I was speaking a foreign language when I tried to explain-- I didn't start having multi-day, 10/10, head's about to explode migraines like this till I started suboxone, so it seemed simple enough-- but I think he thought I just wanted to quit the program, and he encouraged me to keep doing the medicine. So I, stupidly, listened.

I finally had enough on the week of Halloween and cut myself off. I went through the w/d's at home with no support. But I was finally free of those awful migraines, though I still had chronic headaches every day. In my experience these would get better as my tolerance went down.

Cravings are still an issue though, so I decide to try an old friend: kratom. It tastes vile, but it's cheap and it doesn't give me awful headaches. So I buy a bag, thinking hey, two weeks off suboxone means I probably have the tolerance of an infant and can start at a low dose.

Imagine my surprise when I needed 9 grams just to get some slight relief!

So I took a week off, again. Now three weeks off suboxone, surely all will be well... Nope, I still need 9 grams of kratom just to feel a smidgen of a buzz.

I am frustrated and defeated. Three weeks of no opiates and I feel like I have nothing to show for it. Is this normal??? Do I just have a naturally high tolerance or something??

Is there any way to make this process move faster? I've tried agmatine in the past but I've never had much luck with it. ",1511478189.0

Once the plunger hit the bottom boom. A rush so strong like a full body orgasm to the point I was moaning loud and hard because the experience felt do good and just like an orgasm but 50 times better and longer.

It literally kept on lasting for 5 minutes just an intense amazing great rush. I was in the canyon parked on the rocks in privacy in my BMW M4 and 2 minutes in the rush I started driving and driving a fast and beautiful car fast (but safely) felt amazing. Plus I found 2 other sexy cars just racing like it was the track on the canyons, a BMW M2 and a Porsche Cayman GT4 I think and I turned around and followed them.

The music was in too and what a blissful experience. Better than any fucking thing and no cravings after for more like oxy. I feel just fine in the mind unlike oxy where it is a mental high as well and fuks u up and makes u crave more.

Dilaudid in my book is number #1. The high is so clean, the rush so amazingly strong and long and feels just like hydrocodone probably the most content, enlightened, euphoric opiate out of them all. Gives you a great mood lift that's natural and doesn't feel synthetic and speedy and fuks with your mind like oxy.

I first came here after combing various internet resources on what I could expect during my first experience with opiate withdrawal. Months later I found this place to be one of the more valuable resources. A lot of my access has been motivated by selfishness, err self-interest and desire to avoid any level of suffering. 


Beyond that, I've utilized this place as a place to vent while sharing stories for other people's amusement which revolved around me getting scammed or otherwise being disenfranchised by the game. Some of the content was enjoyed by readers but I'm sure a lot of it belongs in a blog. On occasion, I've seized the opportunity of a good mood and creativity to share the occasional Anime or Star Trek GIF and look forward to continuing to do so. 


&nbsp;


Before getting into this shit, I staunchly judged others for being grubby ""pill poppers"" and hated addicts with the highest level of prejudice. Nowadays I can empathize but even I've been driven to wit's end with my ""running partner."" In a way, it's good that I've had encountered a lot of negative experiences in procuring dope through my ""friend"" who is frequently my only middle. Perhaps if my experiences in using dope went better and it was all easier... I'd be more of an addict out of convenience. 


&nbsp;

I'm grateful that I've never IV'ed, am grateful for this place and the nicer people here and even appreciate some of the mean people. 


Last Christmas I was posting about using a spreadsheet to track my dope inventory so that I wouldn't be dopesick when visiting my relatives. This Christmas I hope to be in recovery with the aide of medical professional. I look forward to having money to buy gifts for everyone and look forward to no longer being vulnerable to schemes designed to poach what's left of my money. 


I'm grateful that I did not share the Suboxone that I procured this week with my lying ""friend"". Without it, I don't know if I would've been able to perform at work during the week leading up to black Friday. Theoretically I could've gotten through the worst of dope sickness and been adequately fine to work today but I'm glad that I didn't have to chance it and find out the hard way.


&nbsp;


Finally I'm grateful that I don't have to experience this cold weather in withdrawal on twelve hour work days in a retail setting.


Good luck to all, stay safe, stay well, or if not well.. stay strong.

Quick tidpoint, though I know you are not allowed to post locations, my brother & I live near a major city with an open market. My brother's blood test came back with ONLY FENTANYL recorded. Meaning all the ""dope"" bags he had been buying had NOTHING BUT FENT in it. 

Anyway, he went into detox. After around 24 hours he felt fairly sick, so they were ready to dose him with subutex. This is where I feel like the detox center screwed up. Instead of giving him a small dose like 2mg and dosing him every few hours they decided to give him 16mg! He instantly went into precipitated withdrawal. He was losing it in the detox center they took him to the hospital where the hospital gave him a meager .5mg Ativan (lol)....He went through absolute horror. The next day they gave him 14mg, another huge dose, he started feeling worst again. It got to the point where he couldn't take it any longer and left. I picked him up, scored, and he felt fine. Just think, the fent he is buying off the street had no problem beating the sub blocker. 

Is it possible that fentanyl is such a strong drug that subutex/suboxone doesn't touch it? I guess if he would have somehow had the courage to stick through it he would have eventually been able to start feeling better, but I don't know anyone who has the ability to stick through precipitated fentanyl withdrawal. Do you think any liability is on the detox center for giving him such a large Subutex dose to start with? ",1511624510.0

So I just got hold of a bunch of packets containing Suboxone 8 mg/2 mg sublingual film.
I pop some oxynorm and oxycontin maybe a couple times a month, about 35-40 mg's at the time. So I got basically zero opioid tolerance.
Now, I know Suboxone is some really serious stuff, and if your are not careful your going to basically throw up the next 36 hours (or so I was told).
My question is, how much should I take for a first times? Should I cut a small piece of the strip/paper and place it under my tongue? 
- and what will my high be like compared to oxy? All advice is welcomed, since my only experience with opioids is kodein, tramadol, oxy, morphine and contalgin.
So is it even something I should even consider trying?

Since then ive been in good relationships with women I found attractive and had a good sex life etc but it always ends with me hiding out in the washroom tellin my girl I got diareeha while im realling puttin somethin up my nose

So anyone else find theyre more turned on by opiates then people or get the same thing when using? It can be inconvenient but amusing at times I suppose esp when going under for surgery then waking up to a stack of towels covering your groin area and the nurses being super nice to you.

For the past two years I have been taking 4 Norco 10's a day. I had a doctor who recently retired and now I am being sent to a pain clinic.

I would like to stop taking the norco's and move to something extended release. This is great for me because I am a paraplegic with 5 vertabre spinal fusion and chronic pain surrounding my t9-t11. Being that I have tried every type of pain pill or IV (Dilaudid, Morpheine, Oxy, Opana, etc.) As a person who uses them correctly, I feel that I have information as to what works and what does not. For example, I could take 15mg or Morpheine and not have the same relief as 1mg Dilaudid. I can take 1 1/2 Norco and not have as much relief as a perc.  I am concerned that I will walk in and they will completely shit on my 2 years of prescriptions and sent me out with 3 7.5's a day. 

I wish I would get Oxycontin 2x a day for the amount that would be sufficient, but I dont know what that is.

Is a 20mg Oxycontin sustained 20mg in the bloodstream for an extended time, or is it like 5mg ever 4 hours. Is there a place to figure this out

Regardless, It seems like these places give you what they give you and fuck you if you dont like it. I went to them post injury and they sent me home with 2 5's a day. I had been taking 30mg MScontin 15mg Oxycodones breakthrough, granting it was still acute pain from trauma. It felt like such a slap in the face that I never went back.

So is there any literature or information I can look at on what extended pills actually do? What to say and not to say at the DR (Im used to just tell them what I know and saying ""I am not a doctor, I only know the things that helped in this specific time."" which probably isnt a good idea. Im 31 and dont want to ruin my liver with acetaminophen, and Im pretty tight on keeping my pills because if I dont have them, I dont get out of bed. ANd it has nothing to do with being dopesick, I physically hurt.

Recently I was given 2mg IV Dilaudid and I finally understand what all the fuss is about. That was the best feeling I have ever had next to sex with no pull out in a dime piece. My whole body felt different but it was for such a short amount of time, I just dont get that part. I don't have circles that could get heron or any other crazy shit, and I dont know the dark web so no thanks. Im just saying I can see how that could become a problem if you had a huge ass bottle of it. Only thing is Ive never shot up and my viens are so bad it couldnt if i tried. I am forced to get a picc line any time i stay in a hospital. My Doc messed up one day and gave me 4mg dillies IV before a 4 hour ambulance drive to a spine center... IT took 15 minutes and aparently I smoked my vape in it without giving a fuck. I was ruined for the next 36 hours.



Im rambling because the 1 mg dillaudid i am on is making me chatty. SO In summery

A person who takes 40mg Hydrocodone daily would benefit from what mg Oxycontin twice a day. Some asshole said 30 mg Oxys would eliminate the pain and allow me to stay in my wheelchair longer that 3 1/2 hr to 5 hrs depending.
I just want a life back. Its bee two years of this pill swallowing shit and I just wanna get back to work.",1511577923.0

Since browsing r/o (admittedly only found y'all a couple days ago, but I browsed the sub for several hours, until way past when I meant to go to sleep) I've come to realize that most users aren't pieces or trash, and are in fact humans, just like myself.

I find myself relating to a lot of the posts here about just wanting to get away from life, to escape reality if you will. I used to do the same thing via inhalents, weed, and self harm. Now I do it with alcohol occasionally (when I can afford it). 

I'm also seeing that a lot of y'all use out of necessity, and seeing this sub promote using safely is incredibly uplifting to be perfectly honest.

So thank you r/o for changing my opinion of a very large group of people, and making me realize that that's exactly what y'all are, *people*.

Have a great night r/o, and stay safe out there.

Grind OP on metal file. Spread evenly over aluminum foil. Hover foil over candle, piece by piece, until it baaaaaaaaarely turns light brown or golden. Do to all the OP shavings. Scrape it off. Abuse it.

*I've never seen that method ANYWHERE else, only on a comment reply to my small-time thread with less than 10 upvotes.*

With that being said, maybe some of you guys and gals know of good ways to abuse OP OxyContin. Below are the methods I know of:

* **chew like bubble gum for long ass time**
* **grind with dremel or metal file**
* **""Coca Cola method,"" or use acidic drink**
* **grind, candle melt, viola, magic**
* **microwave method, same as above but above doesn't burn the shit like microwaves and ovens**

Does anybody have any tried-and-true methods to abuse OP?

Even then, I was holy than thou about any type
of opiates until i was like 21. Everyone who found out i was doing opiates was absolutely shocked since I was such an asshole about it for so long.

Between going to prison, being a drug addict, being active in the hacker subculture known as Anonymous, connecting with my musical icons on Social Media (odd as it isn't being IRL friends with them, but it is still a connection nonetheless, it wouldn't take up much room in my book because it is only a small part of the whole Internet part of my life).

Anyways, I wrote out a chapter that was about what lead up to me getting kicked out of drug court, several of the relapses, a couple of the adventures. 

I guess I am looking for critique on my writing style. Is it something you could read a whole book of? What could it use more of? 

The chapter is about a 20min read according to Medium.

Thats what happened to my boy Mike. I lived because one of my four ""friends,"" the one still by my side now had the balls to touch the gross throwing up mess of a 14 or 15 year old. My boy Mike he didn't have that. He got kicked out an after party at his best friends house because of his heroin use,  mike was addicted to a nice fake xannax, cocaine combo and then eventually the ol speedball combo. The use was so short before it killed him I never got to ask why he swtiched from the xans to heroin, what kinda rigs he used, if he snorted. Such fucked up questions to want to ask, yet im still here . He just  went home, got just a little more high. Just a little more wont hurt. We've all been there. Somtimes that little bit extra before you pass out has you waking up in the middle of the night knowing you are going to throw up, and that if you hadnt gotten up to throw it up an a never gotten up again. And sometimes you dont wake up. You choke on your vomit until youre dead. Id imagine you know what's happening, distantly,fadingly, maybe wishing for it to end. That's what happend to him. My own fathter being a paramedic had to see the poor kid on his back white as a fucking ghost blank eyed, covered in his throw up, dead as fuck. His own father had to find him. Any day that could be my poor father. Had the find his own fucking son dead in his bssement. Nothing he can ever due to change it. Oh the guilt that man must feel. I'll never forget my father calling me at work""do you know mike blankname..."" It was like getting tackeld by an nfl player. Never knew somone that died before him, I was real young you know. Especially for what we where into. Never expecred the next thing he'd tell me was that the dude I had looked up to from age 14 and on was dead. Dead of the addiction I too had instilled into me, a kindergarten version of the endless banging fent dope that I call life now. This was bout two years ago by now, still think of the dude often. One of the nicest mother fuckers you ever met swear to fucking god. You dont meet people like him in this game, or fucking anywhere. Why the fuck did i derserve to be flipped over, simple thing really, all that needed to be done was somome flip him over. But it wasnt fucking done. And that's it. His friends made their decision to leave, or Mike left on his own I guess I'll never know. Regardless he's gone. And I'm not.  And I've realized that can eat me away like maggots  on roadkill over why It wasnt me. Or anyone else. But it won't. I understand that this Is just life, it must be coupled with death. Like men and women making a child, living and life create death. We don't all make it as far as others, but no matter how far you get it'll fucking get us all. So why so I live while Mike died? Because thats how it happened. No purpose for his death, no reason for my life to extrend past his other than that I was lucky that my buddy thought it wouldnt be smart to let me throw up on my back. The other three kids thought I'd be fine. I wouldn't be typing this post, and Mike would still be dead. And Ive got to fucking accept that shit like a man. Own that shit, or im going to be dead too. Letting the death and loss and pain be YOU kills you. We simply exist until our time comes, easiest way for me to cope.

7fmqkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fmqkx/interesting_conversation_with_pain_consultant/,8,https://redd.it/7fmqkx,CaptainEngage,Interesting conversation with pain consultant.,"So I went to the only pain management facility in my area around 2 1/2 years ago shortly after becoming a T10 paraplegic. Upon my visit, I had been subscribed MScontin 30Mg and 15 mg IR Oxy for pain. After visiting this clinic, I left with 3x 7.5 hydrocodone a day. My body was in so much pain and they didn't give a single shit. It was a terrible feeling because I had documented proof of what I was prescribed and was looking for a PMcenter that I could go to. I didn't go back.

After 2 years of getting 4x Hydrocodone 10s a day, My doctor was investigated by the DEA. I am not sure what came of it, but when I returned to the office for a final prescription by the replacement, they told me I was flagged by the DEA for the prescriptions he wrote me. Not for pain, but because Clonazepam is a benzo, and he wouldn't write Ambien but instead Restoril (Temazepam). It sorta pissed me off because I am not a doctor, and didn't even know restoril was a benzo.

While in the hospital, My hospital doctor called for a consult with the same pain clinic that gave me the 7.5s, She came into the room and asked my background. She asked what they could do for me and I said ""I have been getting 10mg Hydrocodone for 2 years at 4x a day and my doctor is no longer in practice so I felt it best to go ahead and build a relationship with the center."" She asked why he wasn't practicing and I explained the story as I did to you. She seems surprised that Hydrocodone was all that I took for pain and said she didn't forsee any issue with it.. Totally different then before. I told her that I have been taking Norco for two years and it is obvious that pain management is something I am going to most likely need for the rest of my life. I said that I was concerned about the amount of acetometaphin I will be consuming over the years because sure, 4 norcos a day isnt bad, but every day for 5 years is going to do serious work on my body. Without skipping a beat she said ""I think you are right. It takes a toll on your whole body, Would you consider trying Oxycodone 10 mg without tylenol."" So basically 10mg IR. We agreed that may be best at 4x a day since I have been having an issue with burning out early with the hydrocodone. I feel like I just won the lottery. I am not one to go insane with my pain pills because each one extra I take is one less I have at the end of the month, but with 10mg IR, this makes me happy for various reasons. Oxycodone effects me different and the buzz when I take 2 is more euphoric than energetic, but as they are IR, they can be broken down for a needle. Now, I dont use needles, but I go to the hospital for recurring UTI issues and various this and get admitted for multiple days, always with an IV. I don't have the skill or interest is using needles, but I damn sure will make some premade ""flushes"" for when I am there. Thats 4x a day I will get from them and have a hope because they give my daily meds while I am there. Im interested to see this play out.

In all honesty, If I do get the 10ir, I will use them like I do my hydrocodone. I dont go overboard, but if I find myself with more than my schedule, I do get a good buzz going. So feels like a win guys.",1511700992.0

Wednesday morning: wake up from previous opiate use (100+mg oxy for the past month). Call my dealer. Patiently wait 30 minutes for him to show up at my apartment (he's a decent guy I respect btw) and I buy the following: 1 morphine 60mg er, 2 OP 30s, 2 M box 30s. That was my final dose. I took that shit all afternoon while smoking weed. It was a great day. It lasted well into the night, and I fell asleep soundly at my parents house.

Thursday: take 2 mg of klonopin over the course of the day, don't nod off or anything at thanksgiving but I did take a nap on the couch with my dog after dinner. Could have passed it off as  normal but I unfortunately drop a gabapentin pill on the floor not a good look. By the end of the day, not feeling wd yet at all.

Friday: wake up, shit storm over the gabapentin pill. Parents very angry, also pissed I spent a lot of money last month. Lectures for hours. It was a miserable day, but only feeling slight wd. I'm out of benzos now and switch to gaba. Friday wds start to kick in hard. I get 3 hours of sleep.

Saturday: okay, now I'm feeling this. At this point I have squandered all my comfort drugs and I'm regretting it. It's bearable during the day, I even went out and about with my dad. But as the day goes on, it's getting more intense. Those er pills really delayed this shit. By the afternoon, I have to keep retreating to my bed room in between family interaction in order to recover. My mom screams at me but surprisingly calms down and helps me complete some applications. I manage to make it to the evening.

Saturday night to Sunday morning: this is the worst wd I've felt yet. I know some of you gram a day guys are gonna call me out, but give me some credit, I spent 1500 on drugs last month. I spent the entirety of last night, from 11pm to 7:00, shivering, sweating, having diarrhea, turning the heat on and off, getting up and down, running downstairs for a drink and an apple, and let me tell you, I was in absolute misery. Can't really describe it but the feeling all over my skin was intense. This was true peak wd. I managed an hour of sleep from 3:30 to 4:30 in which I had a nightmare about drugs. Well guys, I powered through this shit long enough. I caved and took exactly 1 lope pill, 2mgs. I am eagerly awaiting my paltry relief. Hopefully this will push me ""over the hump"" of wd. I find the most comfortable position to be sitting in my folding chair a bit hunched. I'll give an update on how I'm feeling later today. Hopefully I don't junk out and take 10 lope. Really hoping I don't do it. I am sick of prolonged misery. See u guys later!",1511699514.0
7fmbkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fmbkb/hows_this_for_a_jj_story/,18,https://redd.it/7fmbkb,Naloxander,How's this for a JJ story?,"So I just recently moved to a fairly big city that borders another country. I won't get into semantics because it's not important.  All you need to know is that I'm in the USA and I'm bordering Canada. 

So I pick up a couple bundles from this new plug I met (off CL of all places).  It was my second or third time copping and his stuff was pretty decent. Anyway, I pull over in an inconspicuous parking lot and do the deed... you all know how that goes. So after a few wax baggies are empty, and I'm feeling much happier, I light up a cig and I plug my home address into the GPS. At this point I'm downtown, and I live a few miles away in the burbs.  

I start driving and come across a rotary with many exits all close together.  I take the one I thought was correct, and my gps thought I took the correct one as well, so I continued on this road for around half a mile.  Then my heart drops as I see signs for the US border coming up.  I pull over at the duty free store before the checkpoints and ask the lady if there is anywhere to turn around without crossing the border.  She tells me I may be able to just swing the car around and hop on the freeway which is tantalizingly close to me.  I put my bundles in what I considered a good hiding spot and turn the car around.

I make it as far as the very entrance to the highway when I see not one, but three border patrol SUVs whip out behind me and pull me over. There are also agents running out of the checkpoint flagging me down. Immediately they tell me to turn the car off and get out. 

""What the hell do you think you're doing?!""
""Sir, I took a wrong turn and was just trying to get back to where I was coming from.""
""Well you went too far.""
""I'm just trying to get back to x, I'm not trying to cross the border.""
""Where were you coming from? Why were you there? What were you really doing? You're acting nervous. Come with me""

At this point the reality of the situation is staring to sink in, and as I'm being searched head to toe I realize my vehicle is getting the same treatment. So basically I tried to keep my cool and answer courtesly, but these guys and gals have a whole nother sense for sniffing out liars and smugglers.

After being searched and basically interrogated for around ten more minutes they told me to have a seat in this locked glass room.  As I sat there there I thought about how I was going to be spending the next decade or so in federal prison. I nearly came to terms with it then and there, because I figured I had no hope of getting away.  After all, these people are professionals at searching cars for illicit drugs.

Well another 20 minutes pass and the officer at the counter calls my name.  Time to face the music. 

""So we found out of state plates behind your back seat. Care to explain?""
""I just moved here from Boston and MA didn't want the plates back""
""Oh I see. Well here are your keys, you're all set.""

Oh my fucking God you guys, the elation I felt when I finally got back in my car and the nice border patrol lady pointed me in the correct direction to the highway back to safety... It was pure fucking bliss. Better than the two bags I did right before this incident occurred.

I got out of there fast and had to pull over once I got off the highway just to collect my nerves and go over what the fuck just happened to me. I was singing. I was laughing, hell I probably even cried.  I definitely went into my safe spot and did a few more bags to celebrate (and to ensure they didn't just confiscate them). Everything was there and I got away Scott free. This type of thing happens once in a lifetime so now I make DAMN sure I'm not on a one-way road to a vehicle narcotics search.

This story is 100% true and I count my blessings every day since this has happened.

TL;DR - made wrong turn in a new city after coping two bundles, ended up at border checkpoint and had my car/person searched. Made it away and am here to tell the tale.",1511694785.0

Usually at night after I take my last shots I'll lay out on the couch and watch some streamed TV. Lately, I've been getting pretty frustrated when I'm nodding and watching a intriguing show with a plot you need to pay attention to, having to rewind every few minutes to catch what I nodded through. It takes like three hours to watch a 45 min show lol. 


I would like some recommendations for shows that are good to watch even if some sections/scenes are missed. One idea I have is ""shitty""/""cheap"" comedy, like Family Guy, etc, where even if you miss some stuff most scenes still funny as hell with no context. Another type of show would be one where scenes aren't dependent on eachother so much, like COPS, skit shows, etc. 

I have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime TV, HBO and can probably access most other shows but would prefer those. What are you favorite shows for my dilemma and what would you recommend?!

Maintenance,"WAs just wondering if anyone has any personal experience with getting off opiates with tapering off then starting subs for a small time before they get off everything completely 

I don’t like taking subs, and I don’t want to be physically dependent on them. I mean the reason I’m retiring off opiates is so I’m not dependent on anything 

I’ve greatly lowered my dose to the point of doing only up to 8mg of hydromorphpne each day for the past couple of days. Before that my normal dose was a minimal of around 24mg or hydromorphone and 60mg or oxycodone  

Yesterday I did around 12mg over 24hour block, with the last dose being exactly 24houra ago and only doing 8mg max the previous 72hours. 

I know for a fact the WD won’t be as bad as normal. But was wondering a couple things 

I will be fine doing subs 24hours last if I slept for the past 8hours of that 24? 
I won’t go into PWDs ? Since I lowered my dosage so low 

Since I tapered off of my normal DOC and dose, doing subs for a week max def is  more then enough? 
Specially if I tapped off the subs within that week ?

Sorry for all the questions and the horrible Structured post 

But any and all insight would be awesome thanks ,!

7fl6dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fl6dg/suboxone_facts/,36,https://redd.it/7fl6dg,klove99,Suboxone Facts,"I'm posting this as it comes up a half dozen times every single day and I'm tired of typing up the same thing. So here's some facts about suboxone:

**1. Bioavailability** *ORAL (sublingual, aka ""dissolve under the tongue"") IS ONLY 30% BA*. That means when you are taking it under your tongue, you are ONLY getting 30% (or about 1/3) of the advertised dose. If you take 8mg by mouth, you are getting 2.4mg in your system. Sniffing is 50% BA. IV is 100%.

**2. The half-life** of suboxone is 36 hours. This means if you have 4mg active in your system right now, tomorrow the same time you will have 2/3 that, or 2.66667 (2 and 2/3). If you take the same amount every day, the dose active within your system is growing. Keep this in mind, you should every couple of days halve your dose to prevent getting to insane amounts it will be hard to ever get off. Here is a calculator you can use to know how much is in your system FROM A SINGLE DOSE. Remember to take into account BA: http://www.drugsdb.com/resources/drug-half-life-calculator/ It's more complicated to calculate multiple days of usage, you can do it one-offs like this:

.

**Math: How much is in my system after X time taking Y amount every day at same time**

.

If you dose every day same time (or if you dose twice a day, you can ""average it out"" to a single dose for less-complicated maths):

Take the amount you took day 1 and multiply it by the BA percentage (so for oral 8mg, this would be 8 * .3 = 2.66667) Let's call this A. Let's call B the amount calculated from the last day.

.

For day 1:



B = A * .6666667 + A

.

For the next day:

.

B(new) = B(previous) * .666667 + A

.

And repeat for each day. For an example of 4 days at 8mg oral,
 
.

A = 2.666667 ( this is 8 * .3 )

.

B(day 2) = 2.666667( pre-dose amount remaining)  * .6666667 + 2.666667

.

B(day2) = 4.44445 mg in your system after you dose on day 2.

.

B(day 3) = B(day2) * .666667 + A

B(day 3) = 4.44445 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 3) = 5.6296mg in your system after you dose.

.

B(day 4) = B(day 3) * .666667 + A

B(day 4) = 5.6296 * .666667 + 2.666667

B(day 4) = 6.41976

.

Make sense?

.

**Math: How long do I have to stop taking suboxone to get down to X amount left in my system?**

.


Then, to figure out ""how many days until I get it down to X level"", just repeat the equation without adding A, i.e. multiple the total by .6666667 for each day until you get below the number you are trying to reach.

So to see where we would be if we stopped taking after day 4 in the above example,

.

B(day 5) = B(day 4) * .666667

B(day 5) = 6.41976 * .666667

B(day 5) = 4.27984 mg at the time you would usually dose left in your system

.

B(day 6) = B(day 5) * .666667

B(day 6) = 4.27984 * .666667

B(day 6) = 2.85322mg left in your system on the usual dose time after  2 days of not dosing after 4 days of dosing 8mg orally.

.

**3. Receptors / Blocking Effects**: Here is a chart that shows how much saturation your receptors have (basically, at any point in time, this % of receptors are being blocked by suboxone) http://www.helpmegetoffdrugs.net/_images/receptor.png . 

Please remember that just because 50% is blocked does NOT mean ""do twice as much"" 


**4. What is ""precipitated withdrawal""** - That is when you force the drugs that are getting you high off the receptors because bupe is stronger than your DOC. This is true for everything except folks doing pure fentanyl or several fent analogs, as those are stronger than bupe and the situation gets more complicated here. I won't focus on that. See next number

**5. Inducing** - You should induce on subs SLOWLY. Take 1mg orally every half hour until you've built up a couple mg (don't try to do more than a few mg in a day, you'll regret it later). If you start to feel sick, hold off a couple hours for you to come down more. THere is a lot of science behind the slow induction, and you can even take a mg or 2 orally as you finish off the last of your bag in order to have an ""easier"" come-down.

.

**6. Naloxone** - ""Suboxone"" contains generally 1/4 the amount of naloxone as bupe. So 8mg bupe / 2mg naloxone. It's put there to be a deterrent against anything but oral. Doing oral, you'll barely get any naloxone; not an appreciable amount. Sniffing you'll get slightly more than oral, enough to make a difference, but not a big amount stil. IVing you will get the full dose of naloxone. Why is this important? Naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal with a vengance. If you plan on doing means other than oral, you will need to wait even longer than you would oral because the naloxone will throw you into precipitated withdrawal harder than the suboxone would. If you plan to IV, it is best to induce oral slowly on day 1, maybe into day 2 (of abstaining from other opiates) before starting to IV, in order to prevent the worst sickness of your life (precipitated withdrawal)

I think this covers it mostly. Maybe we can clean this up and get it stickied or side-barred or something, maybe I can just link folks here when they ask. Please voice your questions you'd like to get answered if I forgot to include anything here, thanks.

I tried to make the math as simple as possible with copious examples, but if you're still struggling tomorrow I plan on coding it up on a website you can visit and just plug the numbers, push button, get result.",1511677235.0

I always thought that if I put some clean time together, life would return to normal and everything would be alright. That day never came, apparently, if you suffer from trauma, even if it is seemingly benign, it will keep you coming back until you end up in prison or dead. 
Luckily for me, I just ended up in rehab. I was skeptical at first because I had done this song and dance once before, to no avail and I didn't feel that I was any more ready to quit this time than the last, although the circumstances I regularly found myself entrenched in, screamed otherwise. 
So I embraced those thirty days in a private residential treatment facility, nestled in the beautiful mountains of western Canada and accepted that this was the end. I dealt with the major skeleton I had been harboring in my closet and continued to learn coping strategies for the outside world. 
Aside from the 50lbs. I put on there, I now smile frequently, my skin is clear, but most of all, I am at peace with sobriety and myself.

I never really post, even though I've been a long time lurker of a lot of subreddits, especially opiates. Something really fucked up happened to me and it has a lot to do with me being on heroin, so I can't talk to many people that I personally know would understand me. I feel like you all would. 

A fee weeks ago, I was hanging out in my staircase with this guy I've known for a few years. Initially, I didn't like him but we have a lot of mutual friends and he lives in my neighborhood so we got to know each other and developed something like a friendship. Anyways, we were in my staircase at around 2am, he was smoking s blunt and I was railing lines of some China white. (He was one of the few people that know I used.) 
To make a long story shorter,  about a bundle in I ended up nodded out, and when I came to he was violating me. He had his dick out and he was rubbing it in my body I had no idea what the fuck to do. I got up and he kept following me and wouldn't stop  touching me until I finally decided to just leave into my apartment.

 I only told two of my close friends about this, because I was not only humiliated this ever happened I felt I would be blamed because I wasn't more vocal with my displeasure and because I was on dope. We all know the stigma that comes with this drug. 

One of the friends I trusted ended up having a big ass mouth and now everyone I know, knows what happened. The man made a post on facebook admitting it all, but he also added all of the details I did not want to get out. People are still taking his side and defending him. Whenever my friend tries to stick up for me, people say ""you should be more worried about her addiction. Not this."" ""Why is no one speaking about the fact that she was on heroin tho?"" ""Why didn't she just go to court?"" ""No one would believe a junkie anyways."" These are people's literal replies. I'm not one to care about strangers opinions but I still feel fucking sick. He admitted to violating me and still no one gives a shit, or they're actually mad at me and want to fight me and the friend that's sticking up for me. And all of this was spread around because someone else couldn't keep their mouth shut.

When I get too high, I just pass out on the couch. Yet it’s perfectly fine for my mom to drink 12 plus beers a night, but if my parents ever found out about my opiate problem, I would be completely disowned. Other than physical dependency, the only risks of opiates has to do with the fact that they are illegal and unregulated. Heroin is what is used to compare the dangers of pretty much every illegal drug, but imo alcohol is pretty much just as bad. Yet 99% of society would tell you alcohol is safe. It makes absolutely no sense to me. ",1511663477.0

The good news is that there is an over the counter medication that protects your liver from the damaging effects of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen depletes your livers glutathione, and when it runs out the liver starts to decay. There is a medication called NAC or N-Acetyl-Cysteine that replenishes your livers glutathione reserves. This also helps avoid hang overs. The stuff has a lot of other benefits, it has been shown to be beneficial to people suffering from obstructive lung diseases as well, and there doesn’t seem to be an upper limit to the amount you can take. I wouldn’t take the whole bottle, but you can take many with no problem. 

Do not take NAC and then think you’re immune to acetaminophen. But if you’re doing it anyways you might as well be as safe as possible. I have personally taken it and taken a huge amount of acetaminophen and I used to be a bad alcoholic. When I had my liver checked for a drug study I was told that my liver function was perfect. 

It only has a 10% oral BA so take at least 2000 mg or so. Anyways, this is the same stuff they will give you if you go the hospital for acetaminophen overdose IV. ",1511661946.0

7fjkph,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fjkph/looking_back/,29,https://redd.it/7fjkph,MaybeIFuckedUpThrway,Looking back,"So five years ago today I was deep in my addiction. I was using 3g of bth twice daily if I could help it, coke and meth on top of that. 

I had been doing sex work for awhile as well, and was making bank. Sucked a lot of cock, did a lot of fetish shit, had a lot of fun. I had showed up to Thanksgiving at my parents' house, looking like I did. And it was not a pretty sight. Nasty arms, was down to 120lbs (5'11"" and looked like a total disgusting mess, not model thin like I thought I was). I do not remember being there. I def was not showing up to my parents' house sober, so that would explain my blackout state. I heard stories how I told everyone I was seeing the ghost of my dead best friend everywhere- which was true.

So I bounced out of Thanksgiving pretty quick and went back to where I was staying. I had a mattress on the floor, but that was all there was. It was this dark little place filled with disgusting energy of shit and dope and horrible thoughts where I would imagine taking a nice big rig and slicing myself up and down my arms and waiting until I felt cold.

I hadn't been high in weeks. I was basically just chasing back being sick every day. I would wake up and have a shot laid out next to me for when I would inevitably wake up sick. 

Psychosis was coming and going regularly, I was getting texts and calls on my phone telling me there were people outside, told me I was plague riddled, spreading HIV and Hep C everywhere and someone had found out about it and sent men to kill me in order to cleanse humanity, ect. 

That was how I felt. Like a shit stain on humanity. Every time I would cop I would tell myself I would rather just be sick for a few days than do this shit again and I didn't.

So 5 years ago it was just me sitting in my shitty little place on my soiled ass mattress smoking cigarettes, shooting dope and smoking meth or crack, updating backpage ad and waiting for calls.

I have 5 years clean in a few days. I dunno if I want to tell that story here or not. I am just watching another junkie do his first detox as I am typing this right now. Plenty of valium for this dude right now. So he is sleeping and I am bored so hit me up.",1511659375.0

I know studies were being carried out. Ive never really been addicted to opiates for a long period. Longest was about 2 weeks of opium use. I tend to binge for a week or so and then quit for a few months. Ive always abused drugs in general though whether smoking weed or my long term benzo habit ive just tapered. Im mostly clean since tapering the benzos and not even smoking pot for the first time in 15 years. Opiates ive fucked about with but i knew that i was too susceptible to addiction(had a nasty k habit for a few years) to do with any frequency but opium, snorted h and even the subs i used for a quick taper(and the one left over i used for a buzz when bored) after a binge just work too well. Exactly as that video on how does h feel like, everything feels fine. This is an issue iv been struggling with for 10 years but since i quit benzos opis have been on my mind since im a downer type of guy.

Maybe its paws from years of benzo use, maybe years of poly drug abuse but im pretty sure my dopamine system is fucked. Even speed paste, which im not really a fan of, picks me up enough to get things done. Ive tried ssris and therapy which never really helped, pot is kind of hit and miss since im in the uk and not legal so the right strain isnt always easy to come by.

I even traded away my life saving in btc earlier this year(and the price has 3xd since then leaving me down about $1m) when i was stuck inside during my acute wd benzo phase(because boredom, possible psychotic break taking insane risk). I just crave a rush constantly its really starting to destroy me. May not be the best place to post since im not really an opiate abuser (its actually rare i use but god damn i can see the attraction) but im guessing a lot of people here are along the same lines as me.

Now he's in severe pain, barely able to function, and extremely sick. Just because of this ""epidemic.""

I feel like this is hurting the people who need the meds more than those who abuse it.
In my eyes, all this is going to cause is a decrease in prescription medication abuse, but an increase in heroin/street drug abuse.
I already know 3 people who made the switch to heroin because they got cut off of their prescription medications. I think this is a horrible sign and a horrible solution to a non-existent problem.

(rant),"Now... just a pre warning that im typing this on my phone just after thunder fucking scared the shit out of me. Fuck you melbourne... first you have a hot as fuck week and now its waking me up from a well needed sleep.

Okay so... ive been using opiates for 3 to 4 years now... mind you that i cannot tolerate more then 150mg of codeine before feeling sick... which is why i probably havent moved onto harder stuff... despite the fact that my sciatica aint getting better magically.

I hate it when people say stuff like ""opiates are a danger to everyone. Youre an abuser that only likes getting high"" etc... and i mean... yeah i hate taking opiates.. im sure deep down we all sort of do. Which is why im lucky that im not eating the heavy stuff. 

But this opioid crisis thats happenining basically everywhere.. i hate it. I sometimes wish it didnt exist because thanks to opioids ive lost 4 friends who were so close to me just because they thought they were functional users... they honestly werent since thwy didnt have a job and all they did all day was get high. Sleep. Get high again. Sleep. Sell their possessions to get high again. Sleep.... i didnt notice this until this year how bad they were... they were broke as shit and i offered them help. But then they turned on me and said ""youre just like us""...

Now... i dont know about anyone else but this hurt so much. This hurt more then any pain ive had in my short life (im not dead but i am only 23)

It took me 2 days of convincing to go to this sub... to understand what everyone goes through... and it hurts to come here sometimes because of the culture... people are looking forward to getting high... to play with death... 

I love this sub... not because i enjoy being here. But because it shows both sides of a long battle... youre all like a little family... but sometimes the images are too much and its heavy to see.

I hate opiates but its the only thing i can take for my back pain... i hate when people mention weed... because the last thing i need is to get hooked on another drug

And please dont tell me that weed isnt addictive because it is... it may not be as addictive as opiates but its still a habit forming thing and thats the last thing i need.

Please... i plead with all of you who are deep in this game... stay safe. I cant tell you to quit (and i know its hard to quit since meds like suboxone are expensive or something) and... well yeah just stay safe. I dont consider many of you my friend but were all family here. We dont want to lose anyone else. 

My friends that died due to opiates had a bright future. One was 2 weeks away from seeing his grandmother who was dying from cancer... now his grandmother has to... well... pass away without seeing her grand son.

Please... stay safe.

I beat myself up over this, I was so emotionally unstable it was scary. I kept thinking that if I'd been around him he'd be here still because I assumed it was an overdose like everyone else. Well, I recently was informed that he actually died from tumors and heart issues that he would have certainly never treated had he known. So, now that has been a huge weight off my shoulders that has allowed me to move on from beating myself up and wishing I could end it all as well. I'm aware he is in a better place so I'm content enough. I still miss him like crazy but that will never change. 

September 11th, my birthday my ever so loving mother attempted suicide. She has actually seen the steps I've been taking to get back on track and she has been trying as well. I think it finally hit her that she could genuinely lose her family if an overdose didn't take her so she finally found a reason to live. Which I am actually happy for her. She isn't clean by any means, and I've accepted she never will be due to chronic pain however she is trying and not the same person she was just mere months ago. 

I have finally stopped being ashamed and hiding from friends and family after my very public overdose and have started moving on. My brother that I actually like, not the one who robbed me while I laid there dying that night has started talking to me again and accepting me. Which alone makes getting up everyday easier. I start a new job next month, which is an extremely notoriously hard job to get in my city which I'm beyond excited for. So, I can finally start my new chapter in life. 

But the best part? I have money in my pocket and can keep money in my pocket. 

I'm planning on buying another house in the near future as well. So, goals goals goals. And maybe a pair of Yeezy's if everything goes well lol.

Mainly the point of this post is to let people know there is always hope. Ups and downs are a part of life, how you handle them is what defines you.

You know the one, with the nodding cashiers. They're around 40 year old women.

I'm 27. I quit about four weeks ago after a pretty short (3 months) but heavy binge. I basically went in to my psychiatrist to detox because I ran out of money and had no way of getting more drugs. I'm on subs now and actually feel pretty positive how things are coming along. I haven't had any cravings. I go to AA almost every day for my alcoholism problem which helps curb all my addictions (I also quit benzos with the alcohol last year after I was taking 10 pills a day and mixing with vodka before bed). But things seem good. I'm starting to make decent money again, and it going into a saving account instead of right up my nose. I'm not scared about this upcoming year. I got this.

But I was watching that video and immediately started to get anxious... my heart got that sinking feeling. I can be one of those women in 20 years, easily. I have no way of knowing. I know I should be thinking *'one day at a time'* but I'm fucking scared. My addiction can take me on another ride when I'm a grown adult, have a family, and actually have a lot to lose compared to now. I don't want to be nodding out as a middle aged woman with kids.

The day after I quit this time, my mother came into my room while I was sweating and sick on the bed. She told me I should 'write down what they should do just in case'. I asked what she meant. She meant I need to write my will, because she's not sure I'm going to outlive her. 

I'm not asking for advice or anything... just wanted to write out how I feel. Sometimes the far future is scarier than the next few years. This is a lifetime burden we have to carry.",1511634293.0

I thought that in order to get my tolerance back to normal and have great effects again i would have to stop opiates during like 3 or 4 weeks, why only a one week break  helped so much ? is it because i was only taking tramadol and it's a very weak opiate ?

I read online you could store urine for drug tests like this for a couple months and it would still be good. Anyways I went to take it out of the freezer just now and put it in the fridge to start thawing. Well when I did I smelled the urine and it smelled pretty stale that real strong pungent smell of old piss. Would this still be useable for my drug test or has it gone bad to the point where they will be able to tell besides the smell? I know the smell is a concern as well but thinking I might be able to pull that off but just wanted to see what your thoughts were on if they'll be able to tell with the test. Like the nurse will probably smell that it's stale as fuck but I'm hoping if I can somehow get past that part it'll at least pass there tests.

firstly, this chat is not affiliated with this subreddit or its moderators, and has its own moderators, rules, and etiquette. if you feel someone there has slighted you take it up with the moderators of tinychat, as it is completely unaffiliated with and not endorsed by this or any other subreddit.  
just a reminder and an announcement that a bunch of your fellow degenerate junkies, chippers, and tourists hang out in [our very own tinychat room](http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat) which has been an ongoing tradition for something like four years now. the location, for those who can't do links for whatever reason, is http://tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat.  

tinychat is an extremely buggy videochat client, but also the only one that fills its particular niche---that being, anyone who knows the room name may enter, and it has a youtube player. any technical difficulties may be addressed by the moderator, namely me. we like to hang out, listen to music, talk about random shit, and lately have even had our own resident sketch artist who draws random crap upon request. the primary purposes for the room's existence are companionship and harm reduction---it's nice to be able to shoot up with others around, even if you are technically alone in the non-digital sense, and have people keeping an eye on you. we're also glad to help with any problems you might be having, or questions you might need answered. we aim to be a welcoming, friendly space for the members of this subreddit to do what we do in good company without judgement. so stop by if you are bored, or just need to talk.  

if it appears like there is a moderator in the room but who is not speaking, just type a few sentences to summon them back. if you are on mobile it is not immediately apparent that there is anyone in the room. either click the button shaped like an outline of a person (i think) to see the list, or say hello to see if anyone responds.  


rules:  

1. pick a unique username. this is to protect other users so we know who is who, given the nature of the sort of activities we enjoy. 

2. no lurking. again, to protect the other users. if you come in the room be prepared to introduce yourself and participate for at least a few minutes so we know you're not up to any shenanigans. if you are lurking you will be warned and then given a generous ten minutes to announce yourself. if the time runs out, you will be kicked (not banned) until you are ready to come in and actually participate. if you are a known member whose identity can be confirmed, this rule is not applicable.  

3. no -isms or hate speech, even accidental. one warning will be issued, any continued insistence on such behavior will result in a ban. bans can be contested by pm'ing a moderator (me). this includes but is not limited to racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia. for example, if you are not black, use of the n-word, even with the -a ending, will not be tolerated. i don't care if your friend down the block lets you say it, it's not your lane. 

4. no auditory fuckery. due to peculiarities of the transmission of sound over a chat, certain echos and effects can be amplified to the point of being severely distressing. if it is determined that your end is causing an echo you will be asked to use headphones, or to mute your microphone when not speaking. deliberately making strange or unpleasant noises to annoy other chatters will not be tolerated, and your broadcast will be closed. (this only means that your video/audio feed will be terminated--you will still be allowed to type.)  

i know the rules seem like a lot but there's really only four of them, and only two that pertain to just behaving in a manner that isn't dickish. 
thanks, and hope to see you there! **don't use alone.**",1511768665.0

The problem is, recently I've noticed almost every time I boot once or twice after slamming the goodness, I get this itch all around the site where I inserted, and soon after pulling out I get these hive like warm bumps all over. I know I don't miss my vein, but it swells up like I do for about 10-15 minutes after I'm done and clean up, then goes away shortly after it appears (unlike when one misses their vein and it swells and hurts for the next couple of days). I was wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this before, if anyone has an explanation for this strange, uncomfortable side effect and if someone has a way of preventing this from happening.

I've been shooting just using distilled water and dope for a while. Recently though, I've been sprinkling just a little bit of non-iodised salt (because shooting iodine wouldn't be the best idea... and I don't buy iodised salt anyway), just a couple grains into the water while mixing, and let me say: **It has made all the difference!**

I don't feel any or very minor pain anymore (I used to be able to feel pain as the shot moved up the arm, for a couple inches until it became mixed with enough blood to not be noticable), the wounds seem to be a lot less and heal a lot better, I notice I don't get the ""taste"" anymore of dope when I shoot like I used to, and overall I just feel better. It also makes sense as your blood naturally contains electrolytes that you should mix in solution which also contains such, I had just never thought it important enough before to warrant actually doing.

So what do you guys think? Anyone else salting the water before shooting? Think you should give it a shot? Share your thoughts.",1511756163.0

If I stretch it, I can usually make it last about 9 days. Tried to chip a few times with very little success. Unfortunately I had a pretty big heroin habit in the past, so within about 2-3 days my tolerance goes through the roof. The last half of the 10 days are pretty much dissapointingly trying to chase the initial high. After the 10 days of bliss I am jolted into withdrawals that seem to be just as bad as heroin (probably mostly mental, but major or minor withdrawls fucking suckl). 

My question is how to get the most bang for the buck. What's the best way to enhance the high?

Also have Xanax and gabapentin. Sometimes I'll add in a little xan to the mix, but that usually results in passing out and not enjoying the high as much.

I went up to 3.5mg again had intense feelings of euphoria but much like the last times ive went up or down these euphoric feeling only lasts for a few days than poops out. its not even a great euphoria its better to describe it as a great anti anxiety/mood enhanced feeling.

Should i switch to Subutex, would that help create more euphoria?

7frfsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7frfsc/looking_back_pt_2/,13,https://redd.it/7frfsc,MaybeIFuckedUpThrway,Looking back pt 2,"So I posted this last night while bored, felt like posting again as I am bored (https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/7fjkph/looking_back).

So that was that. 5 years ago today I was stuck in a hole. Stuck so deep in a hole lacking any conversation where I was not being accused, bellittled, blamed, or conducting business for buying drugs or selling myself. Romanticizing killing myself nightly as a wonderful ascension away from all the zombies and insufferable reproducing masses of people desperately trying to make it seem as if any iota of what they did actually mattered on the grand scheme of things.

I had felt death many times before, felt this wonderful healing, terrifying place where I simply faded into the background. This beautiful form and void where nothing mattered and everything was entirely happy and inconsequential. 

So this is where things get odd and I start questioning the nature of my reality and still question it to this day, whether this was an incredibly vivid manifestation of my psychosis or whether I am now dead somewhere and this reality I am in now is far different from the one I originally was in. 

I had stolen a car and was staying in a motel quite literally called State Line motel, which was so shitty my door was not properly locked, so I decided while shooting dope I would prop my feel up against the door. 

So, of course, shooting dope, I have the needle in my arm and am juuuust pulling the plunger up to make sure I have a nice juicy vein. And then I hear banging on my door. 

""""Sherrif's department, open up!""

Unfortunately the banging on the door causes my unbraced legs to slip and fuck up my grip on the rig, and I see my skin tear open as the door is forced open by the officer. 

I don't really see anything much at this point. I remember a panic, I remember seeing blood pouring out of arm, and that it had this nice and warm sensation as covered my body. I tried to get the strength to cover up the wound and put pressure on it. I just felt warmth of my blood enveloping me as I slipped into this sunken place where moving became laborous, my eyes closed, and the last thing I remember is a cold settling into my body as a tiny ounce of my being tried to will me up and fight while my chest and head felt as if they were weighted with bricks. 

And then I woke up. 

I woke up in a place where I did not recognize, I was in bed, I was screaming at the top of my lungs. A person rushed at me with a flashlightas I grabbed for my arm, gripping it tightly and jumped up, only to fall on my side and smack my head into a nightstand. 

The person with the flashlight calmed me down and asked what had happened. I told her I must have had a nightmare, and not knowing where I was did not help much so I kept a lot to myself. 

I later find out I was in rehab. I do not remember how I got there. The story I was told was my brother had found me in the same motel I remember being in, I agreed to go to the hospital with him, screamed at the ER staff, was placed on a 72 hour hold, and then shanghaied away to rehab once my parents learned of my predicament. I had been there only one night. 

We were not allowed to use phones while detoxing (5 days), and everyone around me was a stranger so I kept to myself. I was convinced I had died and was in some sort of fucked up purgatory while Psychiatrists and docs put me on a regimen of lithium and asked me questions about my use and history.

I was having some pretty serious psychosis and demanded to the clinical director every five minutes that the cameras outside my window and in my bathroom be removed. I would constantly receive the same sorts of texts on my phone about people coming to kill me and all that- except I did not have a phone to receive texts on so that was another hallucination altogether. 

I was screaming about helicopters and Spec Ops teams trying to get in to the rehab in group, all while never hearing from anyone I had ever met before and being convinced I was dead. 

So we went to our first meeting. I hallucinated furry little creatures crawling up my legs and freaked out in the meeting and ran out to smoke and chill the fuck out. It was at this meeting where I first stood up and said I was an addict.

My pukey nasty greasy cold sweaty self twitching and shouting in a meeting stood up in front of a 150 ppl and said I was an addict. I don't know why the fuck I did it I just did. 

I swear to God every one of those people got up and hugged me. 

I used to sing to my tricks after we got done fucking. I would spoon them and humm gently in their ears, stroking their hair. They would almost always bawl their fucking eyes out. It kindof got me off. So as I stood there in my shitty self, getting hugged by 150 strangers, I started crying. 

I just wanted something. Anything. I had given up on the hope of connection with anyone after so long just me and dope that this disgusting outpouring of love and heart, it broke me. I just sat there in my chair shaking and crying and not knowing what the fuck that was.",1511745495.0

What's your version of dope? Ecp,tar, etc..

What's your ROA?

What's your dosage schedule? 

Lastly, how do you support it? 

I use tar, injected, morning, afternoon and night. About .2-.3 per shot. So usually 3 shots a day. 
I support my habit by working a full time job plus doing any side hustle I can. Selling weed/ other drugs. Buying selling items on Craigslist, returning bottles for deposit. Pretty much anything I can do for money I will. Landscape on the side in the summer. 
Now your turn. I just thought of this because I was thinking it's crazy that I've made it years doing this a day at a time. Then I thought about how crazy it is that so many people do this same shit. Same shitty agenda. Same shitty drug.

So I don't know if getting ripped off is par the course or if I just make people want to fuck me over. I've been using for ~5 years and when I was using pills I had no problems what so ever. I'd even get them in the original rx bottle usually. I eventually switch to H a year ago cause I ended up getting hooked (shocker) and it seemed a lot cheaper. I never bought more than a half gram and I thought I knew what a point looked like, so I assumed I was getting what I was paying for. I had several dealers too so it's not even like it was one person. Anyway, I bought a scale on someone's recommendation and have been weighing everything I've bought and without fail every half gram is .35-.45, usually on the lower end of the scale regardless of dealer. Like what the fuck? Is this just how it is? Why would every single fucking dealer consistently be short. Getting single points its only ever 80 mg or something. Yesterday I even tried cold copping at a known spot, got a point and scaled it... fucking .7... and the people going there are definitely seasoned junkies. I'm guessing they assume people aren't scaling up what they buy or maybe that's just how it is and everyone accepts it but goddamn does it suck. Maybe I just give off the impression I'm dumb and I won't ever notice, who knows. In either case, I don't know how to approach this. My town is definitely a sellers market and I'm sure if I called someone out on it, they'd just ignore me and carry on business as usual. I'm thinking I'm either going to go back to pills and just taper down until I can chip again or just use other avenues from here on out cause this is fucked. /rant",1511743719.0

Before I get the wrong ride lecture, I welcome it fully but my mind is pretty much made up. 
So
1. Will my Oxy tolerance transition over to H?
2. How much would get me “good”?
(My Dboy says it comes in caps, and it’s powder inside and it’s a tan color, he said one cap should have me good for the first time)
3. What exactly should I expect if I choose to do this?
(Will I get super high then get sick and come down a bit? Do you always throw up?)
4. Since I said I’m getting it in a cap and it’s tan powder inside, I want to sniff or smoke it, is it possible to smoke the powder? I like smoking oxy so I feel like this is what I want to do if I can, if not I’ll just sniff it.

So my main ended up in the hostpital about 4 days ago for unrelated-to-drugs health issues (he doesn't use). He's in his 50s.

He lives with a 40-something crackhead (occasional user). When she's not cracked out, she takes care of the house, cleans, makes sure everyone is fed....basically does mom stuff and everyone generally tolerates her because of this.

When he goes into the hospital,  shes tasked with selling his pills, mainly opana. Well, she isn't right mentally at all. super nervous, can't handle stress, etc. My issue is that she literally has to do nothing but sit there and hand them out. There are only 3 of us that buy anyway.

Well, she got *so* fucking irritated that she took all the pills to her friends and locked them up so that if anyone needs something, she has to go to his house, get the pills (just the number needed and no more!) and then come home and sell them,. effectively making it harder on herself and everyone else in the process.

Today, she blatantly rubbed the fact that we were hurting and that she was going to take her time getting the pills, in our faces. It was 4pm when she finally graced us with her presence, all the while getting texts from her laughing at me for needing something she had so badly.

So she said she had 7 opanas left and the only people, as I Said, that buy them are 3 of us and I know them all.

When she came back around 4,  she also said that there weren't any more left, that she sold 5 to these people that don't even do them.

She's completely lying. Shes been threatening to just stop selling to us altogether and pretending to be ""out""...a joke that wasn't received well. When she showed up at 4, she was tweaking out, jerky motions, sniffing, rubbing her nose, the works. So either she sold them for crack or shes full of shit.

**I start a fucking JOB tomorrow!!** I was counting on those fucking things.

So i got this crackhead that won't sell me the drugs she's been tasked with selling, probably because she sold them for crack, or because she just wants to be a cunt.

I've fucking so goddamn pissed off right now. I haven't been this furious in a long time. I think it's because she's such a little piece of crap that doesn't give two fucks about anyone else. 

One time, she made off with his last 3 opanas and went on a crack binge - came back swearing she didn't take them, and he **let** her come back to live!

Last night I was at work driving the company car and I hit a deer. No big deal, I’m not responsible, no injuries so I thought I’d just take the night off and start again. My boss gets to the accident and sees that the airbag deployed and says “looks like you’re taking a trip to the hospital”.

I immediately started to panic, the accident wasn’t caused by me using opiates, but if they’re in my system I lose my job. I immediately start doing some googling while we wait for the tow and see mixed answers on whether or not I’ll be tested in the hospital. While I’m looking my phone dies so I only see a few websites before I have to go to the hospital. My wrist and shin started to REALLY hurt by the time I get to the Dr but I don’t say a word because I know if I have an injury I’ll definitely get a drug test.

They overheard me telling my GF my wrist hurt from where the airbag deployed and start asking questions:

“From 1-10 how bad does it hurt”

Answer: 3. Reality: 6

“Can you move it?”

Yes

“Does it hurt to move it?”

Answer: No. Reality: Fuck yes. 

The nurse tells me they still want to do an X-ray and because my boss is there I can’t just say no.

They informed me that my training class will begin on December 4th but they asked me to come in tomorrow (Monday the 27th) for the paperwork portion of starting a new job. They also informed me that at some point I will need to pass a drug screen.

However, I do not know if that will be given to me tomorrow with a 24 hour time period to get it completed or if they will wait until the later in the week or even when the training class starts. My guess would be tomorrow they will give me a form that will require me to complete the drug screen within 24 hours. I have already informed the recruiter that I have another job that I have given notice for and will be leaving before the training class begins so if worse comes to worst I can try putting it off by saying I am too busy with work and need a couple extra days to clear it out of my system.

Now, my question is, if the drug screen is just a 5-panel test, will oxymorphone and xanax show up as positive on test. I'm fairly sure xanax won't even show up on 10-panel, but I could be wrong about that, but lucky for me that's not what I'm dealing with right now. I snorted oxymorphone and took xanax orally this morning (Saturday the 26th), so if I was to test tomorow or Tuesday I'd most likely fail. But I've heard from a few different sources that neither of those substances will show up on a 5-panel, but what has me worried is that oxymorphone has small amounts of morphine and if I happen to test positive for morphine I will fail the test and lose the job before I even begin.

Any answers and advice would be greatly appreciated! That is, unless it is just someone saying my best option would be to quit altogether. Obviously that's the best course of action and I wouldn't be here if it was that easy. 

Also, as an aside, if I was to start taking suboxone today and over the course of the next few days, how would that affect a 5-panel (or 10-panel test) test for that matter?

Edit: What the fuck is up with this sub? I just wanted to post and get a better idea about what to expect with my upcoming drug screen and right away had ppl calling me dumbass and telling me to shut the fuck up. You guys have a severely toxic community and I feel bad for anyone just looking for help.",1511724857.0

Serious shit post right here guys and gals. For anyone who think there life sucks, just take comfort in knowing someone else has it worse. Oh, and I forgot to mention my dad is dying of stage 4 lung cancer and doesn't want anything to do with me because of my drug use. And the rest of my family hates  me because of my addiction as well. I wasn't even invited to Thanksgiving this year. Fuck em I guess. This all happened about 2 and a half weeks ago, I just now am feeling better having detoxed off a gram of fire ecp (most likely fentanyl) and feel up to posting about it. 

  .            .So it all started about 2 and a half weeks ago when I was driving on the highway, high as the dude from the Red Bull jump, when all of a sudden BAM!!! Fucking slammed into the median and completely totaled the left side of my car. Somehow managed to pull over to the side of the road and called for a tow truck, all the while hoping and praying a cop doesn't show up to see this high as fuck junky sitting on the side of the road. Tow truck comes lickidy split and picks me pathetic ass up. Got seriously lucky I didn't get another DUI so I guess some good came out of this one. 

.          .Fast forward a few days later. My dealer Big Black picks me up from my place to give me a ride to work, and gives me literally the best dope I've ever had in my life on the way over there. I do a shot and am wrecked! I serve tables at a high in restaurant and need to be on my A game when I go in. Well, he pulls over and says, ""nigga you is fucked up. I think you should call off tonight you lookin real bad. You can't even keep your eyes open."" I reluctantly shrug off his suggestion saying I go in looking like this all the time and I'm cool, I can't call off anyway I need dope money son! So, I go in and work my shift thinking I'm cool, nobody knows about my drug use. So after doing a 4th shot in the bathroom stall at work I come out of the bathroom and my manager says he needs to have a word with me. He sits me down and proceeds to tell me he knows something is up.""Dude you come in here one day and your totally fine and then an hour later your running around the restaurant like a crackhead Energizer Bunny. Then an hour later your falling asleep while rolling silverware. What's up man is there something you want to tell me? If you need some time off to come off a medication I understand I'll help you out and grant you some unpaid leave, anything I can do to help?"" I break down crying like a little bitch and tell him I'm all fucked up on drugs (I never specify what I was on) and I need a week off from work to detox. He acts all cool with it and even gives me a bro hug ( you know like the handshake half hug) before he sends me home for the night. 

.          .So I call Big Black to come pick me up and tell him what happened. ""I told you nigga!"" Yea, I know Black, you are always right. Tell him I'm gonna be outta the game for a while and I won't be seeing him for some time. I get ahold of a couple subs and start my detox the next day. A day goes by, cool, I'm getting my life back everything will be ok. Then, a day later my manager calls me. Ooohhhhh shit this isn't going to be good. He tells me I'm too much of a liability to come back to work and they they have to let me go. That two fucked duck looking mother fucker!!! Take your bro hug back you piece of shit!!! So I just lost my job and I'm feeling sick as fuck even with the subs. I'm now broke and jobless with bills piling up.

 .           .I tell my girlfriend I have been using lately and just lost my job because of it. She dumps my ass right on the spot and tells me to get my shit together before i ever contact her again. Great, the love of my life doesn't want to be with a junky and I can't really blame her. We were together for almost 2 years and she has stuck by my side through many relapses but she told me last time if I fuck up again she is flat out done with me. So the love of my life is now gone!!! Im now carless, jobless, broke, and too sick to go out and look for another job. And without a car my options are extremely limited.

.          .My half sister has offered many a times to let me stay with her to help me get clean. I was just never ready to before this all happened. I  made a grand a week at this last job and wasn't ever really willing or wanting to quit using. She lives over an hour a way in bumfuck Egypt where I know I can't get any dope and there aren't any temptations. I guess it's really time  to quit for good. I call her up, tell her what happened, and before I know it shes at my apartment to pick me up to take me back to what is now ""home."" I call my landlord and tell him I lost my car and job and I will have to be moving out seeing how there was no way I could come up with rent money in time let alone keep my gas and electric on. Shit, I didn't even have money for food, fuck me! 

.           .So here I am about 2 weeks after all this has happened. I took Suboxone for a few days and then flushed the rest down the toilet just wanting to be done with all this shit. I took Kratom for a couple days after that and don't even know if it really helped because I still felt awful. I've only taken a little Kratom this past week and I feel fine as of today. Just super fucking depressed about the whole situation. Sorry for the wall of text. Hopefully somebody feels better about their life after reading this. Take care everyone.",1511723557.0

Edit: I am truly grateful for all the advice given so far. As for the unprotected sex thing I am in a steady relationship and my family already doesn't like him. I don't want to add to that. I really hate lying so I'm just awful at it. Mom can usually see right through it. But I just can't bring myself to tell her what I've done. I don't know what I'm going to say but she keeps asking. I'm going to have to say something soon,

Edit: For those who are wondering what pronoun to use, I'm a girl.

Edit: I am aware of rights to keep my medical info from my parents. However my mother is a great mom and me very much. She deserves to know.
