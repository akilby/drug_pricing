If so ELI5 why this is?,"I remember reading something somewhere similar only with weed. It was something like if you have more you will end up doing more instinctually instead of trying to save it. It always seems like when I try to be savvy by buying more at once that it never lasts as long as I had planned it to and I just end up doing more. For example, if I only have enough  for a dub for a day I would feel satisfied with that amount, but when I have enough for a gram to last a day that same amount would not satisfy me and I would do the whole thing in one day as well.I always kick myself when I run out of money and think about how I should have managed my dope better, but oh well as Cartman would say ""Its my dope I do what i want!""
I have found that this is not an isolated incident and I have talked to countless other people who have gone through the same dilemma, can anyone explain the science behind the thought process behind this behavior?

I've been lurking for a while. I know the majority of you are against the acid circle jerk, but here is my story anyway: 

So the other day, on Monday night, I took one hit of acid. I have no fucking idea how much I took.
At around seven in the evening, I took half of a tab. Then I went to a hibachi grill with my friends Abby and Dallon (changed) and saw a food/flame show and around eight took the other half.
My friends and I headed out to the falls in Joplin to chill and smoke while I tripped. I lied down in the gravel by the water and started to feel that the trip was coming on. I felt like I was melting in the gravel underneath me, and every sound I heard was beautiful. It started to get fucking intense, and then we left and went to another park in the town I actually live in.

We got to the park, and I felt another wave (presumably because I had taken the other half later) of the acid. Literally right as it started to hit me, I was walking under an arch and into a beautiful garden with a paved path around it. I paced around this garden for over an hour.

We left and headed back to Abby and Dallon's house, but since they wanted to go to bed I started to get a little freaked out, so I called my friend Anna and we left and went to a place called Cherry Corner, walked through the woods for a while and then found a clearing by a creek that was the most beautiful place I had ever seen, and going back to check it out sober, it still is. 
We were just chilling and talking for a while, but then something happened. I looked into the sky, and saw the stars and the branches and leaves of the trees above me, and then in just one second *everything* turned black and white, the leaves and branches turned into spikes and pins and needles, and I fell into a dark, dark place.
At this point, it was around 12:30ish, and I started to freak the fuck out. My whole body felt like I was covered in pins and needles, and I got extremely emotional and overwhelmed. I started to feel like I was going fucking **INSANE**, and proceeded to lose my shit.
Anna was trying to calm me down, but there was nothing to be done at all. I was not really registering what she was saying to me, and started to find patterns in the things she was saying and assumed she was being a patronizing bitch. I kept this up, and started to get even more freaked out. I started spewing honesty about what has been really going on with me for the past few months (I've been extremely depressed and I have shut off all of my friends) and started to cry. This cycle of her trying to calm me down, me assuming she was patronizing me/being pretentious/being mean, and then me getting deeper stuck in my own mind continued for three hours, even after we had left the woods. I then realized that I was projecting my own insecurities and fears onto everything she was saying, and realized how much of an asshole I have been lately. I have been so selfish and hateful toward the people that love me that I didn't even realize how much I have that I have taken for granted. My friends, my family, my mentors, they all care about me and love me immensely and I have shut off all of them and been a total *cunt*. 
After the trip started to calm down, it lasted well into the next day (it finally waned at around 9:00-- over 24 hours of trip). I realized so fucking much about myself and my life, and I am making a change.
Fuck self pity. I'm starting to work out. I'm getting a job. I'm going to be a good person. I'm going to love my friends more than they even love me. I'm going to stop littering. I'm gonna finish out my senior year. I'm gonna start college next year. I'm gonna **stop being a pussy**. I'm done with the old me, I'm going to be the best me I can possible be. I am taking a break from weed and I'm not using it as a crutch anymore.
After a trip into insanity, I appreciate normality so much more.
And I can finally say, for the first time in my entire life:

I am happy to be alive.

Like I moaned in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/52tz3i/damn_my_good_connecttrap_is_shut_down/d7nn130) there were no prospects. My main d-girl was out and the local alts are useless. Wasted £40 last night & barely felt shit.  

Then recalled a guy who was in the game in a minor way, kind of a friend, more a drug-hang-out. Used to trade his g/f's pain script for my valium regularly. He moved away after some bullshit trouble/animosity locally.  

Now, I'd ignored him since. One reason, he watered methadone before trading me. And generally he's a compulsive fantasist/bullshitter.  

I frankly told him that I'd sell him tablets but didn't want friendship. Ostensibly because I was in NA and had to cut all ties to users. Harsh thing to say but whatever; I didn't want him in my life.  

Until today. Met him in city and we got several batches of heroin & cocaine. Incredible sizes & quality. My dude middles but intro'd the coke guy, for going direct. H man too, but I have to spend a little more £s first.  

Went to pal's place (actually belonged to dying g-mother) for session. I gave him a half-g brown, plenty burns off the foil (& for his woman) and 2/3 points of good coke. I decided to re-up with the last of my ATM limit; we went out and got 3 brown/1 white. Once back, he asked to see the package I'd bagged up, then emptied only 2 brown/1 white on the counter. Now, I glanced at his hands but no sign, of course.

OK - I can't *prove* what happened, but like with the 'done I mentioned earlier, I just *knew* b/c I'm not ferkin stupid. He didn't even check the floor at his feet, in case it dropped. Which you would, right?  

Anyway, he phoned the dealer, who is pissed that a civilian finding the bag could jeopardise him somehow. Then we went out with flash-lights to look for it on the route. Which was sketchy as hell, searching by a busy road at night.  

Knowing it was a waste of time - *unless* ---  ""Man, if you find that bag I'll give you the last of my coke bag [enough for a shot].""  

Sure enough, his immediate craving for IV coke overcame tomorrow's stolen scag high. After a lot of fucking around, he turned a corner and 'found' my bag (not a plausible location, bag was in package by then.)  

Now he's full of self-praise and plaudits for his eagle-eyesight, ffs! Well, whatever...despite such fuckery I'm pleased with the day. Got high as a satellite and made new connects, unexpectedly. OK I had to pay him that coke hit but considering all the discounts compared to my regular d-girl...worth it.

Just got to stay alert with these types. Ultimately: if you sup with devils, use long spoons.  

TL/DR: Couldn't score, then got a fake-friend to plug me in to a new scene. But he stole a bag of H which I manipulated him into giving back. Or maybe I'm wrong and just completely burnt-out & paranoid. Whatever.",1473994975.0

I had just run into my long, lost roommate friend(story for another day) a few moments agO. 
Hes an occasional chipper,and I recently cut waaaay back; a few weeks ago, I went from doing 10/12 bags daily, to doing maybe 3 bags in a week. Anyway, someone a block or 2 behind us started yelling at us (yeeooo!!) we looked back, saw a rather large black girl, and both decided that weve never seen her before, so we kept it movin. 
She got progressively louder, ""YOO YOOO COME THRUU!!"" 
We decided to hook a left, circle the block and check her out again, maybe see what she wants. 
Once we could see her again, my buddy whips out his glasses, checks her out, and his face lights up. "" Thats my cousin!!"" 
We approach her. ""What, y'all dont know nobody??!""
""shit cuz, i aint have my glasses on. Plus,. U no how niggas be around here!"" We all start smiling before she whips out a ziplock bag and hands us 2 fat little blue wax bags.
""Well yall shoulda came back, i got samples! We 24/7, just knock on the green door with ya money ready"" while pointing over at nothing more than an abandoned building. 
Shifting her gaze to my homie's girl and her friend, who were waiting up a block ahead and serving as our look-outs, she continued. "".Give the extra two to ya friends up there""
We told her we would, and continued on to meet with our lady friends while agreeing to keep this (extra dope) between us. 

TL;DR
Got 2 free sample bags in a city where we just had a carfentanil scare, when a ton of ppl ODd on some kind of Fent analoug, and many died from unmarked free sample bags.  

They are the traditional blue wax bags without a stamp,with about a 0.1 of light-brown/tannish fluffy powder. 
Ive been taking 8mg sub almost daily for about 2 weeks now, and want to know how long you would wait after you last dose, and how much would u do just to get high from this mystery fucking dope they have these days. 

I always take every precaution, and have read the sidebar multiple times, but tips and suggestions are welcome. 
Thank you, my fellow dopiates.

Man this relationship has been a TRIP. When i met her in April, I wasn't getting high. I smoked weed but wasnt banging dope.. until I spent more time with her.


She was constantly SMASHED up on rum and klonopin. I'm talking from 8am til whenever she passed out midday and then continue drinking after her powernap. She'd talk about how she used to get fucked up on blues and coke and how much money she has now.


 Needless to say, by May, I was banging dope and by August I had two ODs and a stint or two in detox... and she didnt really know the scope of my addiction OR how much money Ive taken from her. I think now shes starting to catch on and our relationship is going to shit... but not just because of that. I dont know what else to say.

 I'm a scumbag and i love her, and I just want to change my life but I dont think she can help me with that. I want to pay her back at least some of what I've taken but I'm so embarrassed to tell her the extent of my betrayal. 

Dont get me wrong, ive practically turned her life around positively...I clean her place everyday. I drive her to her various doctor appts and everywhere else (because she's fucked up). I also make sure she eats well and takes her pills everyday.. but that doesnt justify me stealing from her. 

Ive gone 3 weeks, 1 week, and 10 days clean at different times since meeting her in April and constantly try to go CT for two or three days.. but I always fuck up, usually when I'm around her. Idk wtf to do. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. Love you guys.

My question is - obviously I'm not exactly feeling much from sniffing anymore at all. Is this due to tolerance, or is it because I've taken to shooting as well?

I try my best to spread good information out there. Many in my group depend on my opinion when it comes to drugs, how to do them, when and in what combination for desired effects but it's begun to lead into me being asked to shoot people up who've never shot before. At first I felt like I knew if i just let them experience it they would never try it themselves.

 I'm beginning to see these ""favors"" as mistakes. Have I done wrong by these people? 

A good friend of mine normally takes subs but he's also my ride to the city when I need it. He sniffs his dope and He's scared of needles so he never shot it. Recently i was told he's done doing dope but wanted to experience the rush many speak of. He's the kind of guy who when he says something he does it. So I kinda shrugged my shoulders and shot him up. He enjoyed it and we haven't been down since.

Another friend took me as their buddy for a trip to the city. They were looking for wet but it was too late and they all went in for the nite. Can you believe that?! I guess wet isn't popular anymore. So we drove around while I tell them what drugs we can acquire in the area - They decided on some coke. They offered me a bar and a smoke up for taking the trip and cold copping for them. We arrive home and they break out the white girl and offer me some. My needle fetish comes into play and I tell them I'm gonna boot it. They decide they should too for best effects. This is another person I'm sure would never do this on their own. I oblige.

However this morning I'm reflecting on these actions and want the communities input. Did i do these people a favor? Did I make a mistake? There are other people beginning to ask me to hit for them as well. There are always drugs in it for me.... but I'll feel guilty if i hear these people turning to the needle later since I gave them that experience first.",1473955774.0

One of the guys kinda looked like your typical down on his luck junkie . Unwashed ,bad hair old clothes etc . They quickly parted company and the guy went in the opposite direction and the dealer was going the same way as me . So I started walking fast and caught up with him and shouted for him to stop .As I got into normal talking range I ask him what he's selling and if it's kit .He says he is selling and I ask him what he's selling it in Tenner bags ,half grams ,teenths etc . He tells me he's just doing tenner bags but two of his are about 0.6/0.7g for your twenty quid . So i'm a little cautious and ask him if he's got one bag (don't want to be sold make-up or some shit) and he says thats cool but he doesn't have one on him and I'd need to follow him round to his flat which was two minutes away and I know the flats as a friend used to stay on the third floor they're council bedsits. Hes on the bottom floor and I follow him into the flat listening out for a TV or talking as I serious hope i'm not about to be robbed but the flat was empty and I sit down on his couch and he pulls a baggie out from his bread bin and starts making up a bag :) We has some general chit chat and he says he recognises my face and starts rattling off names of people I may know and I know most of them so this probably puts his mind at ease plus the fact I get my money out . He gives me his phone number and asked me not to come to the door as he doesn't want any traffic at his flat or to tell people he's dealing as he has all the customers he wants at the moment and I tell him thats no problem and my lips are sealed . I text him with my name so he's got my number and tell him I've got a contract phone so calling him is no problem .

  He tells me the dope is pretty strong and is really good on the foil  but I tell him I IV it and he tells me to be careful as its strong . I tell him I will while thinking yeah m8 thats what everyone says ! lol We do the exchange and he gets me out and walks me to the bus stop where my bus comes basically instantly .

 I get back home and get my stuff ready and open up the wrap which is a cigarette paper folded up and wrapped in cling film which is a common way people make up bags here . Put it on the cooker add some citric & water and put some heat to it and it cooks up fine and it's nice and dark . Draw up the shot using the built in micro filter in the syringe cap . Put on a tourniquet and register first try :) take of the tourniquet and push in the shot then 4/5 seconds later I can feel it surging through my lungs and up into my neck and the back of my head where I start getting pins and needles in my jaw and the top of my head . So I quickly go into my cupboard and take out my naloxon and -place it beside me just in case as this is a good hit the dude wasn't lying this stuff is fire !! :) I start drifting in and out of consciousness waking up every time witha fright as it feels like Im falling/vertigo . So I decide to go down the stairs and make myself a coffee and sit out the back where if I do OD I'll be found quickly . But i'm fine after about 15 minutes I go back up the stairs to enjoy my nodding . After about an hour or so I sober up a bit and stop nodding . I feel great and now have my OCD head on and start doing cleaning and hoovering then once I done that I decide to cut the grass out the back door . Then by the time i've done that its about dinner time and I reheat the lasagna thats in the fridge from yesterday . Finnish that and I download/torrent a couple of films from the site I used I watched Eye in the Sky and ARK which was quite good a time travel film made by netflix . 

Round about 8pm my new friend texts me asking if I was okay and what I thought about the dope which I thought was nice of him most dealers certainly don't give a fuck normally though there has been a number of deaths in my area the last couple of weeks 5 people have died though they were mostly mixing dope and fake valium that are really strong and certainly contain more than valium and more than 10mg or pre gabbas . I tell him his stuff is fire and its the best stuff Ive had in months as I never nod off with just dope and normally need a couple of valium to get a nod . He tells me to be careful but I tell him my shot was hours ago and Im fine now . 

 So I get up this morning and nip straight into town and give him a text asking if he has two bags and he quickly responds saying thats cool and to phone hi once I'm off the bus . Which I do and he meets me in two minutes gives me the bags and tells me not to do the two of them and I tell him I wont as I'll need to keep one for Sunday . Go to the bottom of the high street and I get the bus back up the road and have a hit once I'm home :) Not as good as yesterday :( dam you tolarance !! plus I had 20ml of methadone yesterday as well .

I don't know much about dosing at those levels, so I figured I could get some help from you guys to prevent me from irreversibly harming myself.

I have some questions and need some help,"What's up fellas. I was hoping I could get some answers about this new dope I've been picking up. I'm in Los Angeles and have been using for about 3 years. In that time the only dope I've grabbed, more or less, is BTH. It has came in different consistency, smells, and strength but for the most part it's all been pretty similar.

Now my guy hits me up telling me he's just got some ""China white"" that he snagged from a shipment that was on it's way to Chicago or some shit. He says it's super expensive and he would have to sell it point for point. His stuff recently has been pretty mediocre so I was excited to see what's up with this China shit.

So I open the sack and it's a really fine off-white powder. The only powder I've had in the past  was brownish and it would stick together and become harder if you breath on it or roll it around in the palm of your hand. But this stuff is completely different.

Whatever though, I was excited to throw some down and take some hits (I'm a smoker by the way [foil]) the first thing I notice is how it doesn't run down the foil at all like BTT does. It just burns up in one spot. The taste is very chemically almost like when you smoke meth off foil and you burn it too much. It hits me super quick, like within seconds, and the high is very nice. It must be strong shit I'm guessing. But the thing that is fucking horrible is how nauseous I feel about 10 minutes after hitting it. It's extremely awful and basically kills the high.

Having no experience on using the kind of dope, I was hoping you guys could give me some pointers. A friend suggested that I put down a drop of water first on the foil then putting the dope on and hitting it. This didn't seem like it did much different. 

Is there any particular way I should be smoking it? Should I even be smoking it or should I snort it? Any way to avoid the awful nausea that follows? I'd appreciate any and all comments so I can learn more about this stuff.

btw, I don't IV and don't plan to.

535rha,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/535rha/profound_miraculous_mental_improvement_of/,8,https://redd.it/535rha,whataboutudummy,"PROFOUND, Miraculous Mental Improvement of Withdrawal/PAWS From a Nutritional Supplement","I hate to be dramatic, but this is amazing. 

I have a long-term opiate addiction, and this past year I dabbled with alcohol and benzos and psych meds for the first time because my life finally fell apart after many years of ""using successfully"" (i.e. without running out of money or completely failing in my social/professional life).

I have been using sporadically after kicking dope a couple weeks ago. Most days I feel like crap, and I've been using every 48 hours or so, using small doses compared to my old habit, and this cycle is miserable, and nothing like my old life of just good old steady use.

Anyways, I've been feeling like garbage, which makes me want to use, which makes me feel like I'm in withdrawal almost all the time, never clean, and only high for 12 hours out of every 48.

Today I took *NICOTINAMIDE RIBOSIDE*. I took 125 mg in the morning, empty stomach thirty minutes before breakfast per the instructions (which said food was optional and to take upon waking), and then another 125 mg later in the day on an empty stomach. It was HPN Niagen off of Amazon. It's pricey, but it was *so fucking worth it you wouldn't believe it*. I want to note that I took this stuff one year ago, after being clean for a couple months following rehab and still feeling PAWS badly, and just not feeling like my real self, and it had similarly miraculous effects then. In fact, when I took it that time, my ""body was tingling"" (not in a scary way, and nothing like niacin which involves actual flushing) so intensely it was amazing. (Normal people don't have that strong of a reaction -- I think my addiction for 10 years had robbed me so immensely of this nutrient that I just felt it that much more. The smaller the damage to you, the less you'll feel it, I'd imagine, but that's not a reason to refrain from repairing what damage you do have.) (Edit: And, I also think that good feeling in my body is actually pretty much what normal, healthy, happy people feel normally. It was amazing to feel it return like that. I felt the same thing today, but toned down a ilttle, possibly because I only took 125 mg instead of 500 mg.)

Nicotinamide Riboside boosts NAD+ in the body. Taking NAD+ or NADH orally or sublingually directly does not boost NAD+ in the body according to my research. **The treatment of addiction by boosting NAD+ in the body has been known about since the 1960's when it was used successfully in South Africa. This treatment was done with IV NAD+, which does (not surprisingly) successfully boost NAD+ in the body, just as Nicotinamide Riboside (aka Niagen) does.** So, this isn't snake oil, it's not new, and it's becoming more popular (the IV treatment, at least). Honestly, I want to open a clinic myself if I can truly regain my health. I cannot think of a more worthwhile occupation than treating drug addiction in a way that is effective. (It didn't just make me feel better physically and sleep better, I'm thinking so much more clearly, and using heroin tonight felt very optional instead of imperative. I was able to sit on $40 that I would normally have spent immediately.)

After taking the Niagen at a dose of 125 mg, I could literally feel my body sort of tingle. I felt like I did when I was a teenager, before this whole mess, on a good day. I took a nap and actually felt rested, rather than just bolting upright -- fully awake -- whenit ended. Some of my semi-compulsive behaviors (e.g. drinking stupid amounts of coffee even when anxious) that I do when sober abated.

I am including a link here [https://www.thefix.com/nad-brain-restoration-addiction] that describes the use of the IV treatment with NAD+. I believe that the oral supplement they send people home with is Nicotinamide Riboside.

Again, I want to emphasize, I have taken a lot of vitamins in my life, and although I think some have value for addicts of opiates (and alcohol and benzos, etc.), there is not a single one that I would come on Reddit and describe as a miracle or that I can say with absolute certainty from my own experience has a profound, entirely helpful effect.

*This stuff is making me feel so much better and think so much more clearly that it is making quitting drugs and surviving seem possible. This is day 1 today, but I did this one other time and it worked then, too. Please do this for yourself if you have a long-standing addiction or feel like you are cognitively not doing well (mental disorders, old concussions, etc. -- these are all things that complicate addiction and can be helped by this substance). Further, it appears that it doesn't aggravate any mental disorders. I've personally dealt with all sorts of mental issues, and am currently dealing with anxiety as well as the opiate addiction, and it did nothing but help the anxiety, sadness, sleeplessness, etc., and I feel less paranoid, I was starting to get somewhat paranoid when sober, I think from just having so much stress...

OK, rant over. Check the link, do some more research, and please take the vitamin or get the IV treatment if that's available to you (but the vitamin works well orally and is cheaper!).

The only opiate I have ever done is opana 30s. I usually only buy one like once a month and do the whole thing in about a week or so (snorting).

My question is, am I going to go through withdrawal after tomorrow night?

That I was inside you?

You savored the feeling

Were in awe at how time flew.


We started off slow

Meeting every few days

Then you called on me frequently,

Begging to play.


We started off great,

You were upbeat and chipper.

But the more time we spent

That flame started to flicker.


We fought and broke up

More times than just one.

You would cry as you hit me,

You would vow we were done.


Then back you would come,

Begging, pleading for more.

I came to your rescue

As you writhed on the floor.


It was us verse the world,

Just like Bonnie and Clyde.

Your parents were floored.

Behind closed doors they cried.


They ask who to blame

for what you were caught in.

They demanded my name

And you said ""Oxycontin""


So apart we were ripped.

You felt scared and alone.

The ropes binding us: clipped.

Our secrets were blown.


You're on your own now,

But don't be confused.

Never forget,

Anyways I just needed to vent and share the situation I had to deal with today. 

I got a text from a strange number asking me to middle for him. Guess this guy was locked up with a good friend of mine and my friend gave him my number so when he got released I could middle for him since me and my friend have a couple mutral dboys.

Now I've been out of state for about a month so I haven't been copping from anyone lately but before my trip out of state I had done plenty of business and given this particular dboy thousands of my own dollars and probably thousands more middling for others. So today I meet up with my buddies jail friend and he wants a gram and he's even willing to throw me half a gram for doing this, awesome!

I call the dboy and let him know what's up need a G of boy. He starts asking questions like where have I been why haven't I hit him up and I explain I've been out of state for the past month but I'm back now and first mistake I made is letting him know I'm with someone/not alone. After his questions he asks me if I know where the trap is and I say the name of the neighborhood he was trapping at before I left and he says no he moved the trap spot, which is normal he basically moves the spot every few months and traps out of his customers apartments and houses in exchange for heroin or crack. He let's me know the main street his new trap is at and tells me to call him when I'm there and he'll tell me where to go. 

I get on the road he told me and I call him and ask where to go from there and he says 804. Now apparently my second mistake, I repeat 804 over the phone and he flips the fuck out, he asks me if I'm setting him up and why am I acting so funny, he says he doesn't believe me when I say I was out of town for a month. I apologize and try to remind him I'm not familiar with this new trap and I was just asking for clarification if that was a building number or apartment number. He tells me to call him when I'm outside and his dude will meet me outside there is no apartment number and then he hangs up. 

So I'm driving around these side streets there are multiple buildings on various streets in this neighborhood and we finally find the correct building without too much trouble and I call him back and let him know we are out back and give him the make and color of the car I'm in. He flips out again and says that isn't your car and starts flipping out and starts accusing me saying I'm trying to set him or I'm trying to rob him or something. He tells me the deal is off and he isn't fucking with me unless I'm alone and there's no one else in the car and hangs up on me. 

Now I'm not sure what has changed between now and a month ago but this dude has never been so paranoid or so much of an ass hole previously. In the past he would even ask me to bring him new customers, and I have so I never imagined me having someone else in the car with me outside his temporary trap would be an issue, especially when neither of us know the exact apartment number. 

Also it was a smack in the face for this mother fucker to accuse me of trying to set him up with LE. I'm not a snitch and even if I did get caught up in some legal trouble I would never fucking snitch on this dude knowing that he came here from Chicago and he wasn't alone there are 10 others that came here with him and they are all part of a drug ring which I imagine is much larger. I'd never rat regardless but if I was going to rat it definitely would not be on this guy.

As for trying to rob him, that's another ridiculous accusation because I know for a fact he has a door man who is strapped at all times.  The first time I was introduced the first thing I saw was his door man sitting there with a fucking semi auto on his lap as another of his goons patted me down for weapons before being directed down into the basement of this house. I'm not a pussy but the thought that I was getting setup and was about to be beaten and robbed for everything I had on me did cross my mind, but luckily it was a trusted friend who was introducing me which put my mind at ease, slightly. 

Now getting accused of being a rat and trying to set this dumb fuck up, and being accused of attempting to rob this ass hole was a huge waste of time and waste of gas, not to mention kind of embarrassing seeing as I had this guy who was cool as fuck to me, who's trying to split his dope with me 50/50, and I have to explain that we have to leave and explain exactly what happened. He was completely understanding and told me not to worry about it, shit happens, etc. 

At this point its late enough in the day and my other dboy is off work and can serve me no problem. His dope is cheaper and the best compared to anyone else I know anyways so I suppose it's a blessing in disguise for that to happen. We go to the other dboys house and I come out with 1.2 grams and before we part ways he hooks me up with .6 for my troubles and tells me he'll hit me up within a day or two. 

After being accused of being a rat and accused of trying to rob that paranoid asshole I need to find myself another secondary dboy because I sure as shit am not calling that fuck ever again. That shit was not only embarrassing but also pissed me off, plus it made me fucking paranoid. After I got off the phone with him the first time I wasn't so sure *I* wanted to continue with the deal at that point. For a split second I considered telling him we have to go somewhere else cause I was starting to think he's pissed off for me repeating his building number so what if when his dude comes out he pulls a gun and just takes the money, and maybe even shot us. It happens all the time, drug deals going south and someone getting hurt for no apparent reason.

Long time lurker here, never even had an account on Reddit. But I have a quick question. Preface- I don't have any kind of real tolerance at the moment, I have been off the tar coming up on two years- I was one year clean with Vivitrol on board and now have been using about 10grams of Kratom a day for about a year. I decided that using the DEA ban as a reason to quit sounds like a good plan. Got enough left for a slow taper till the 30th. But I was cleaning my room and just found half of an 8mg Suboxone strip from probably 2 years ago stuck to a piece of paper. Should I take it? Should I take half of it (2mg). Is it still potent? I know if I take it I probably won't be able to feel anything from the Kratom for at least 2 days, luckily I've got the next 2 days off so if I do take the whole 4mg today and get high (most likely I would since I've only been taking Kratom) then I can just chill the next couple days while I'm in mild Kratom withdrawal since the Sub will block the Kratom for probably two days....Thoughts?

I started my sub taper yesterday morning and took a little more this morning. Then things started going to shit really fast. I won't list all my grievances but life gave me a thorough mollywop. All within the space of three hours. At this point I said fuck it, I'm done being sober and responsible, I'm just going to keep running from my problems. I picked up some dope and started using. I knew I would need a lot to break through the sub in my system. I used about twice as much as I normally would and kinda sorta managed to break through. Right now I'm alternating between feeling stone cold sober and not being able to keep my eyes open. So now I'm just sitting here in the library feeling bad for myself. I'm not really sure where to go from here. Part of me wants to give up, to write this off as a failed experiment and continue walking down the path of the poppy. Another part of me says this is just a temporary mistake, that  I can get back on my taper tomorrow. But I hate subs. They make me emotionless and gray and boring and useless. Yet another (potentially insane?) part of me is weighing the pros and cons of forcing myself into PWD. There's no point to this post really, apart from self-pity and bitching. Suboxone is a miracle drug, but also fuck Suboxone. I'm depressed and confused and rambling so I'm gonna cut it off here.

Edit: since I still have some sub in my system, could I take more right now and not get PWDs?

This is a true life skill that will follow me forever.

""and other short stories"" :-O","Have you ever made a slight change to your routine? Done something that took a little extra time? Perhaps even saved you a second or two..  But, by doing so it has placed you a slightly different position in time & space - a position that may have altered your life significantly forever?

An example:  
  
I had left my house a half a second later that I would have done, I forgot to put the top back on a bottle in my fridge and when I picked it up, I spilt some. It took 10 seconds to wipe up the spillage - then I left.

   
Cars were letting each other out into the queue one after the other in a civilised manner. But because of my delay I was in a position in the traffic where the car that would have been mine was smashed into by a lorry at an intersection, killing the driver.. 

Well, today I decided to do something differently. Not anywhere nearly as dramatic as a lethal traffic accident, but it changed the outcome of my day for sure! 
  
  

So, without exception, I buy two bags of H. It's all I can afford and I need that much to get through until the next day until I can more money. If I don't but those two and spend one of them on crack instead - then I have slightly more fun for the day, but then I spend more time sick. (obviously!) 

   
But for some reason, I just decided that today I wanted to be greedy, fuck off my tomorrow self and actually enjoy myself. So I got one bag of dark and one bag of light (crack).

I headed to my every-day petrol station garage, it has an attached food court and toilets, nobody is ever goes there, toilet is large, well lit - pretty luxurious for my needs :) 

(Off topic: Every so often I have an amusing moment or a funny story relating to using dope, I'm collecting all the best stuff and I'd love to turn it into a script for a television show. (Heavy adult rating! Drama, death, crime, drugs, misery, euphoria, the underworld.. based on as many true stories as I can accumulate. Heaven knows I've got enough of them!)   

Lol.. I just got an idea for a real-estate agent showing a junkie round various bathrooms. 
""Sir, this one features gold faucets, filtered water, wipe-clean marble tiles, air purification and extraction, a very classy syringe dispenser, along with alcohol wipes and a variety of flat surfaces, it's also very well lit. Only $1/half hour"" 

""I'm sorry, this is a bit out of my price range of $1/half hour""   
  
  
""No problem sir.."" 

They leave to visit a place with broken toilet door, a strange yellow liquid covering the floor with odd floating pieces in it, weird blue lighting to prevent people seeing their veins, no toilet paper and a constantly running faucet that not only wouldn't switch off, but the water coming from it wasn't completely clear! 

  
""Well sir, this is only $0.02 cents/half hour"" ... 
  
""Perfect, now get the fuck out so I can do my hit!""
  
 

Um.. anyway.. so I'm in the stall, unload all of my gently paraphernalia (now there's story for another day. I am now EXCESSIVELY CAREFUL when preparing my drugs - I had to go to work on Tuesday, I somehow managed to pick up a bag at 9am before work - this is not only completely UNHEARD of, like a junkie fairy tale - ""You what?? A magic dealer came to meet you before 10am!! I don't believe a word of it!"" Anyway, I was fucking desperate for it. I was pouring sweat, felt like I was about to have an anxiety seizure! I'd had a shower when I woke up and I needed another one 20 minutes later! That shot would have allowed me to go to work -  not high, but damn well enough to make it. 
  
So, what happened.. I was in a rush, I leaned forward and the spoon balanced on my thigh  flipped over spilling my shot all over my jeans which soaked it up like a sponge. Now I have a little brown stain on my right leg on my shorts, I know what it is, but there's nothing I can do about it. It spread out and was dry almost immediately. I just stared, sack jawed at the stain, watching beads of sweat drip off my forehead and mix with it!   

  
Ultimate panic crept through me. I've got no time to go back for more. I've got no money for more. The dealer doesn't front.. ever. (Shit. I already had an argument a couple weeks previous for having the absolute audacity to ask for a front of £10 because I had walked all the way over from another town over an hour to see him, but forgot my wallet (yeah.. don't do that!) .. he was so angry that I even suggested it that he cut me off for two days and accusing me of being police! Paranoid fuck!)  

Um, no dope, sick, work.. late for work! 
Can you say ""s c r e w e d !"" 

But that's another story. Today will be much better. I prepared everything carefully and I decide to start with the crack. I so rarely use the stuff that I don't have a pipe, I just fashion all the tools I require from thick aluminium foil. I'm ure aficionados will be yelling at their screens, like I've cut an expensive cigar wrong or something, but it suits me, working well enough for my needs anyway. So, I break off a piece of rock, put it in my makeshift set up, roll it round with a flame, take a massive, slow, deep hit. I time it perfectly, as it all turns to smoke I suck in the last of it. Except, at the last second, a tiny liquid drop must have seeped through a small hole in the foil, hit the flame and suddenly everything suddenly catches fire!! 

  
I'm not bothered. It's fine. I've smoked all of it, I'm just peeved I have to deal with this blackened charred mess in my hands! The black smoke and smell is awful. Right then, I hear the door open and somebody walk up to the urinal right next to my stall and unzip. Still no worries, just a pedestrian. I can't hold my breath any longer, I let out a cloud of crack smoke - trying to catch as much as I can by breathing it out into a scrunched up tissue. I drop the foil and stamp out the fire. I think it's time I move on rather than wait any longer and do my dope hit next.

I start to bundle all my needles, spoons.. general shit all over the floor into my backpack. Then....

""Krrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrkkkkk Officer 10-6 this is control, possible As-b in progress at the corner of Lewes and Level. Please respond""..   
  
  
JESUS HOLY FUCK. There's a police officer less than 1ft on the other side of this flimsy divide and I've just let out a huge cloud of crack smoke which has just drifted over the cubicle along with a homemade pipe and smoking gear which caught on fire ad produced a ton of dirty black smoke and burnt crack residue which I stamped out and could probably be seen under the cubicle along with all my needles and other junkie junk.   

I CRAM EVERYTHING into my bag, casually open the door as a large cloud of white cracky smoke follows with an eddy current swirling in the air behind me. I don't make eye contact but I notice he is either undoing or doing up his zip ready to piss. I estimate either way I have about 10 seconds before he's put it all together and either gives chase or gets on the radio to his partner outside in the the car (hopefully still busy filling the patrol car with fuel) telling her to look out for a guy matching my description.

I casually stroll out of the toilet. Leave the shop at an increasingly fast pace and as soon as I taste fresh air, I FUCKING BOOK IT as fast as my coke enhanced heart and circulation will allow. (Actually,  not sure if that was a help or a hindrance, but I go for a good 3-4 minutes, ducking through alleyways , weird overgrown  paths up and down short staircases in places off the main road I never knew even existed!around a few office buildings, a couple of double back on myself.. into a few dead ends (idiot!) through an industrial park and back to a main road back to my house, where I cooked up everything I had left and enjoyed a giant well deserved snowball! The quite large crack crumbs hadn't bounced out of my pocket while I was running, which I was really pleased about, so I had myself a big reward when I got home safely! 

:)

Well.. that's the story. The twist is, that had I chosen two bags of H instead of one of white and the other dope (Which seriously, I never, ever do.. I always try and stay well until the next time I have to score it's only - if I have extra money, I will go for the pleasure of an occasional extra bag of white)   
 
But I would have been in the toilet cooking up on a spoon, creating smell, making noises, being obvious and it would have all been right next to a police officer who would definitely have either busted in the door in or waited until I walked out. 

 
Either way, crack saved my life today!",1474045071.0

I'm very strict on my usage, and I don't use more than once or twice a month.

I've tried Oxy 4 times, and all of them were great dissapointments. The pill was some sort of ER formula, and I've tried eating, crushing it up and swallowing it with a mouthful water, AND I've tried snorting it twice. I've always had weed ready, but still after a couple of jays the experince was just ""chill"", nothing more. No big euphoria, no nod, no heavy body load, just a general calmness. Even tried drinking shitloads of grapefruit beforehand, still nothing.

I've nodded quite a lot on tramadol, so why the fuck doesn't oxy work for me? The Oxys are 20mg Rebelton. Any suggestions? Maybe mixing with 5mg Diazepam/0,5 mg Klonopin? Also inb4 ""just try heroin xDDD""

tl;dr I can't catch a nod or even a decent high on oxys, what am I doing wrong?",1474182060.0

Turns out it was extremely similar to good heroin, and not potent enough to seem like fent.

Now i'm thinking about getting 5g's of this fent and 1lb of mannitol to make my own. I have access to a pharmaceutical V-mixer through my buddy that presses bars, so my mix would have no hot spots.

My question to you is, what do you think a good ratio for a gram would be? I'm thinking 2-300mg fent and 7-8 mannitol.

I haven't gone through bad withdrawal, but I crave being back on heroin so much... I hate being sober.

I have bad depression - I've been suicidal on and off for years, and regular meds don't do shit for me. I'm terrified of therapy, so that's not an option. Plus I'm super socially anxious, so I don't date and I can't keep friends. That's why I love heroin; it makes me social and even functional. I can even have fun, like when I was a kid. I can hang out with people and not sweat from nervousness. I can enjoy video games. Plus my self confidence goes way up.

I'm counting down the hours until I'm high again. But right now I just feel awful. I'm starting to crave cutting again, and that shit sucks. This is how I felt before I started using; now, though, I know what happiness feels like, and it makes being miserable so much worse.

So basically, the only thing that brings me out of my fog of sadness is an expensive drug that just hides my problems instead of fixing them. FML.",1474170749.0

I was given 15 50mg tramadol, 5 perc 5's, and 20 Tylenol 3's over the last week (hilariously they started with the percs first thinking i had kidney stones) and all that shit is gone as I'm at a 60mg oxycodone tolerance snorting give or take and about a half a 40mg Opana snorted. I tend to only use once or twice every week with most usage being when i can get 2 Opanas at once and they'll last me 4-5 days.

As y'all can guess though, that shit is expensive and I absolutely can not afford to buy shit almost daily just to ease the pain. I'm at the point where I start limping halfway through the day and am stuck in bed by 9PM in tears because everything hurts so much (where i can finally take a Flexeril to knock my ass out).

Does it happen with mota, white girl, crys? Do d-boys clearly take advantage of the fact that most of us will wait a ridiculous amount of time with little to no explanation? Yes.No.Yes. Clearly, there are exceptions to this but I am using a hyperbole to make a point. 


•Ways to avoid the dope wait:
  

*Dont rely on only one connect. If your one and only connect becomes aware of this,reserve a spot in the parking lot at your local Walmart and be prepared to update your Netflix queue to that show you've been hearing about, but haven't found the time to watch it.
Its always good to have a backup.

I've been on lamactil for 2 weeks now and it's not even a high dose. I'm only taking 25 mg a day so far. 

The strangest part about all this is when I take a Roxie not only do I not feel euphoria but all the typical symptoms I usually would have don't happen either. Like a cold nose, body itch, constipation, that little pressure you get in the back of your eyes when you know it's kicking in. It's like I might as well be taking sugar pills.

There's a fairly good chance that i'll end up un rehab before the end of the year and i have no idea what's waiting for me there.

I'd like to know how it goes, how long it lasts, what's a typical day in rehab, how often can i seen friends or family?

I've been using opioids for a few years and oxy for a year and a half. I do at least 60mg a day, but i need 100+ to really get high.

Now i'm in Europe, and i assume that rehabs over here are different than in the US.

Thanks for the help.",1474138322.0

I've read a few topics about various drugs being put in e-juice and then vaped with a e-cig. I know this is possible with opiates as I've read someone doing it with H aswell.

 I've currently got some #3 and would like to try out this method, but I'm wondering which e-cig I should get? 
Also looking for personal experiences with this, I'm assuming it wont work well for people with a huge tolerance, but for us light weights it might be a viable option?
I'm also wondering what amount I should put in the liquid, but I guess that is dependent on how much PG/VG is evaporated per puff so wouldn't be hard to find out by experimenting a little bit.

And at last, would leaving the H in a PG/VG solution turn it into morphine over time, or would it stay stable?

If anyone can think of anything else, I would love to hear it!

What e-cig should I get for vaping H?",1474133698.0

I'm a researcher studying the opiate system in the brain and as much as I know about the theory I don't know much about the human side of things. I was wondering if people would mind answering some questions about opiate use?

Edit 2: If you'd be more confortable pm'ing me instead of posting, go for it !

1.  How long have you been using? How did you start?
2.  How has your DOC changed throughout your use?/ How did your use evolve?
3. What does the high feel like at the beggining and later on?
4. Is quitting something you'd want to do? If so, why or why not? Have you tried quitting? What helped and what didnt? What do you think could get you to do it?
5. Have you used naltrexone/narcan/saboxone/bupe to quit? If so, how did it go? What did they do that helped and what do you wish they could do?
6. In lurking I've seen people saying they will use it to stave off w/d when they can't get opiates, could you elaborate on how that works for you?
7. Do your doctors tell you about saboxone and the other or did you hear about it somewhere else?
8. If you could tell anything to someone working on helping people with opiate users, what would it be?

Again, I want to reiterate that I won't be using this information anywhere and it is only so I can understand more. And since fair is fair, if anyone wants to ask me any questions go for it.

A week or so before this I had broke down crying while taking a shower due to discovering myself bleeding abnormally, once again for probably the 800'th time over the past 4 years. 
I was diagnosed with pelvic cervical cancer in February 2012, I staged up to 2b this past March. I would be lying if I didn't tell you this played a major driving factor in my addiction. I have no children, I've always had a dream to carry my own and the cancer isn't slowing down despite removal and exam every 3 months. 
Anyhow, my mom heard me crying (by this time my throat felt like it was closing up). She rushed in with an Ativan and held me in the bottom of the shower for what felt like the longest time. *All of these things are coming to a reality....and I'm sober for the first time in 8 long years trying to deal with it.* 

""Happy Birthday Momma,
Another trip around the sun, you're my sunshine. It brings tears to my eyes recalling recently when you came to comfort me in the bottom of the shower...it tears me up remembering myself screaming *Momma! Momma!*. I don't think I've ever needed you *more* than I do now. Not even as a child. *You* have played such a vital role in my continued sobriety. God truly must have known my desperate need for my mother these past months. *You* are a shining example of what lengths a loving mother will sacrifice for her babies.
You knelt with me in my broken state. You were there *with* me. Now, you are pushing me towards a second chance at life. *More* than any past birthdays, *this* day I can say I need you most in my life. I can see how you give all of yourself every single day for us. Thank you for being the anchor I so desperately need. I am so blessed to be given to *you*. God must have known my need for your love and comfort. 

You are the strong mother I want to someday be. 
Love you, Momma.""

All I could do was try and catch it with my hands which fail miserably as you can imagine ! lol Thankfully it wasn't too much about 3 or four mouthfuls worth and it was all just saliva which I must have swallowed when I was sleeping . So I had to clean that up with kitchen roll and cleaning spray . All the while my stomach was churning, a bit of a runny nose and of course a horrible taste in my mouth and a layer of sweat on me like the morning dew .

   After that I got my teeth brushed and a quick wash all over by this time it was about 8:45am and most dealers will be opening shop about now . So I get ready and quickly put on clothes hoping to get the 9:13 am bus . Ive got about £21.70 or thereabouts and its 2.20 for a single into town . So it's either get 1 bag and my bus fare home or a half gram or 2 bags and walk it back at this point I haven't decided but I make my way out the house and down to the bus stop get there and as soon as im there the bus comes . I get on and the bus is mobed and like a sauna . I have to sit in the disabled seat right down the front that faces everyone . Great ! hope my nose doesn't start going like a waterfall or get dry bolk as everyone on the bus will see me . But I'm fine and the bus doesn't make to many stops and we get into town quite quickly .
        Phone my new guy that I met the other day and he doesn't have... FUCK ! But he says he will have quite shortly and will give me a phone . But I can't wait so make the 10 minute journey fromnthe town centre to another dealer . Get there and give the buzzer a buzz and no answer... FUCK ! Two little girls are coming down the close as its a bank holiday and the schools are off and they let me in the close . Of course my dealer is on the top floor so I trudge my way up to the top . Theres a key in the lock so someone must be in and I give the door a chap and my dealers brother answers the door and tells me to come in . I ask if she's got and he tells me yeah what are you looking for  ? Tell him just a bag as I'm still in two mnds wither to walk or get the bus plus I've not had of them in a few days so don't know what the dope is like . Tell him I'm pretty rough and he tells me he was the same this morning tossing and turning all night in a layer of sweat as the nights have been really warm this week  well for Scotland that is ! lol 25/30 degrees C  . Tell him I can't stay which I normally do for half an hour or so as I'm rough and need to do this . Say to me no problem and to watch out for the cops when Im leaving . 

 Walk over to the multi storey car park about 5 minutes away which has a number of stair wells that no one uses as they are minging and you can use the nice shiny escalators instead . Sit on the second floor and cook up and get myself no problem :) and all the sickness almost all melts away . I think I have a little bit of a bug that I caught the other day and still hasn't fully cleared up but I'm feeling about 95% awesome ! Roll a smoke and just sit for 5 and I notice some IV crap lying about needle caps ,alcohol swabs/packets and citric packets and cookers . So I got to the top of the stairwell and start picking up all the crap and put it in my sin bin that I have with me in my bag . Takes 2 minutes and thankfully no actual syringes . Someone has wrote on the wall ""Exo Zombie Junkies Get a Life  ! "" Ive got a load of markers ,pens and stuff in my bag so add to the bottom of it "" And pick up all your crap ! There's no excuse ! As every chemist does an exchange ya useless cunts ! ""  Not sure what Exo Zombies are ? lol Think they are out of Call of Duty ??

  By this time about an hour has past since I phoned my new guy and decide fuck it I'll just walk the 2/3 miles back home . Give him a call and he says he's got now and asks where i am I tell him and says to phone him when im at the bottom of the town which is only 5 minutes away . Get there and give him a call and he says he will only be two minutes and about 2 minutes latter he turns up and I follow him into a close as the service buttons are still operational that let in the postman . Hand over my tenner well £9.60 and ask if its alright im short 40p and he says its cool . We leave the close and go on my way heading out of town on my 3 mile walk .

  I get about a mile out of town and im walking by a group of shops ,bookies ,buchers etc and hear someone shout my name from across the road at first I can't see who it is but soon spot a guy in a silver cars gesturing for me to come over . I recognise the guy as someone that lives up the street from me . Don't even know the guys name and ive only spoken to him once when he gave me a run home when I met him at a dealers . So I hop in the car and he asks if I could score for him as his people don't have and tell him no problem as I've just scored myself and he will definetly still have . I tell him we will need to go into the centre of town to meet him which is a cunt for parking and is a one way system which doesn't make it easier . I ask him how he managed to spot me as I was on the other side of the road and he says just by luck and he thought I might have just been coming back from scoring and tell him he is right on the money .He asks me what the guy does tenner bags ,half grams etc and tell him he just does bags . Hes says thats cool,and he's looking for two . So I text my guy saying I'm looking for two and he responds right back saying thats cool and to meet him in the same place and to phone when i'm there . We just about get there and I give him a phone .

   We manage to get a parking space just up from the meeting point thankfully but don't have one of those pre-paid cards for the parking but we are only going to be two minutes . He hands me the money and I tell him to hold on to my bag and to wait for me as my guy specifically told me not to give his number out or bring people with me and I tell him this and he says thats cool . So I get out the car and jog down to the meeting point and after about 30 seconds I spot him coming out the alley and walk over to him and I follow him into another close and he gives me the stuff and we part ways I jog back up to the car and there's a traffic warden standing by the car lol I open the door and at that the warden(scumbag) says you don't look like his mother and i shout to him ""I am his mother ya bam."" and jump in the car and off we go leaving him standing there and my neighbour is laughing his head off saying he told him he was just waiting for his mother and he'd be two minutes and he also had a disability badge for the car . He was laughing away repeating what I had said to the warden . Once he had stopped I gave him his bags and he gave me mine back and we headed home .

   On the journey, he asked me how I took it and told him by IV and he said he usually smoked it then asked if I had any spare citric and syringes . I told him I had loads in the house and he was more than welcome to have a packet though I told him if it was the same stuff as the other day it's pretty strong and to be carefully and he said he will . We get into our street and he confirms where I stay and we stop outside and tell him I'll be two seconds . Go inside and get him a packet and grab my naloxone as well and jump back out side give him the packet and ask if he wants me to sit with him for 10 minutes to make sure he's alright but he says his missus is in the house and she'll keep an eye out for him . I tell him thats no problem and to be careful . He says to give him a chap if i'm ever stuck for getting into town or if I need a sub and he'd be happy to help if he can and tell him that's much appreciated and I'll keep it in mind and with that he drives off up the street to his house . I go back inside and get my stuff ready and have another hit :) and that has been my day so far folks I Hope you've enjoyed the read and you've managed to get to this point . If so happy nods from Scotland and I hope your not in WD through lack of funds or worse you've got cash and no one has dope !  So lads and lassies have a good one !

I'm big on legalization for a number of reasons, but I see it as every single person, every single dollar that goes towards drug criminality, is a person and a dollar that's not spent on keeping me, you, and our families safe. Every time there's an act of violence, there's a vice cop of some sort that was not there to help prevent it. 

I wonder how these events help of hurt things out there. Probably neither, but if I had to run a police force, and suddenly bombs were going off, I'd gather vice guys (and gals) and divert some of their efforts. Let's focus more on this......and less on this. 

When crack came around, suddenly that devil weed wasn't so bad after all, hunh? And when people armed to the teeth start spraying dozens of people down, suddenly that whole area of people using substances doesn't feel like a good use of law enforcement and ""criminal justice"". 

The problems of deep addiction can be addressed in other ways but we need real commitment. The parents passed out in the car with the kid in the back can be addressed in other ways. The problems of unknown, fentanyl and other chemical adulterants, overdoses, disease, drug money related violence (nearly all the violence around drugs is about money, not drugs) , gangs, weapons, homelessness, wasted tax money, roadblocks to employment, etc, etc, can all be addressed in other ways. 

I remember seeing this funny protest sign years ago that was a comment about the sort of lazy Marijuana user that said ""Kindly please slowly continue decriminalizing marijuana!!""

In my 33 years of using marijuana, it is now sorta kind of legal. Wow. And that's great, very happy about this, although there are people being arrested for marijuana in the US every hour. 

What we need are bold, sweeping changes in how we deal with people and substances. A radical shift. And we all need to participate in this discussuon, with others, and shake off the ""shocking"" reactions people have to these proposals. Legalize heroin!?!?!! Angel dust?!?! Meth??!! 

""Yes. Absolutely. And let me tell you why. A, B, C, D, and furthermore, etc."". If you're a harder core user, junkie, well I understand you may not feel like the ideal salesperson to win a debate but you can. What specifically is holding you back from having a better life right now? Maybe come up with 3 things. I don't want to speak for anyone but I find, among harder core users, that the top things in the way are:

Past, low level arrests, maybe even warrants that need to be cleaned up. A wall of ""background check"" that severely hinders the ability to get work and other aspects of stability. 

Physical addiction that requires jumping through too many hoops to address it. A process that splits up couples, etc. A generally unwelcoming system that is system driven, not patient driven. 

An illicit market that increases risk of harm on many levels, from risk of purchase, financial drain, uknown product, unclean processes, and all the other issues that a black market creates. 

I'm not saying you have to be ""pro legalization"". But if we look at it as helping people, and propose real changes, we can have a positive impact.",1474289182.0

What can I do with these patches?","I have some crappy Aveva/Apotex brand Fentanyl patches and not sure what to do with them...

Supposedly heating pads used on Fentanyl patches will release the fentanyl from the patches faster than normal. Approximately how fast will the fentanyl be released using a heating pad? How long does it take to notice the effects of the fentanyl while doing this?

Anyways, these Aveva/Apotex patches are the kind that look like foil on the sticky side. They are the patches where the fent is ""in-adhesive"" (NOT matrix, NOT gel) and they do not work correctly no matter how they are used apparently. I don't generally ever try to get high or use meds other than how they are prescribed however these Apotex patches only last for 2 days MAXIMUM!!! I'm trying to figure out what I can do with these things after the 2 day. I'm assuming they still have fentanyl left in them but that because they are such a shitty brand the delivery mechanism is screwed up (A LOT of people say these things are completely worthless). Would using a heating pad help? Heck... if I use a heating pad on them right after they are put on what would happen? How fast would I notice the fentanyl?

What else can you do with these crappy patches? Because they are only lasting 2 days (or less), they won't last me until I get more so I'm just trying to figure if there's ANYTHING I can do with them. The other brands I've used (i.e Duragesic, Watson generics, etc) all lasted 3 days EASILY but Apotex is pure horse shit. I've been told to just compensate with breakthrough meds for the time being until I get more of a better brand but I REALLY want to avoid that if at all possible.

Are these things so outrageously worthless that they aren't even worth messing with or is there something I can try? There are a lot of reports that people who can get ULTRA-high by using 1/4th of a 50mcg/h patch of other brands orally (buccal/sublingual) can BARELY feel (if at all) using a FULL patch of this Apotex nonsense.

This is my first time back here since getting clean (I used to post a lot on a different account). Tugged at my heartstrings a bit, I miss reading some of you. Damn funny, helpful and honest (mostly...).

So I've been on subs for the past few months and today is my 5th day off- was prepared for literal hell. Thought I would post a little about how it's been so far with w/d as I was pleasantly surprised.

Two bundles a day landed me somewhere around 18mg of sub. Just a sheer mouthful of orange garbage. Slowly I weaned down while in the hospital and leveled off at a maintenance dose of 12mg.

At 3 months 'sobriety', I decided enough was enough and started clipping little pieces off of my strips. 

Over 20 days I reduced my dose to 1mg with minor side effects- moody, tired, depressed.

Then, 5 days ago, I just stopped taking it. I was terrified and psyched myself out a lot.

Day 1 - Totally manageable, although irritable.
Day 2 - Wiped out. Short tempered. Very seriously depressed and couldn't motivate myself to drink a glass of water. Slept terribly. 
Day 3 - Same as day 2, but started feeling better in the evening. Went to the gym and biked 10 miles.
Day 4 - Slept in, went on a very long walk with a friend. Definitely had some sweats and fatigue but totally manageable. Felt amazing in the evening- basically normal!
Day 5 - My motivation has taken a big hit, but it seems to be returning (I would NEVER have considered writing this two days ago) with very little soreness. Baseline depression.

All in all I thought I'd be crying and shitting myself. This is totally fine. 

Love you, r/opiates. There will always be a place in my heart (and a scar on my arm) for you. But I couldn't play the game anymore.


EDIT

Day 6 - Very mild stomach stuff. Biked 20 miles. I get tired much more quickly but am really upbeat, it's weird as fuck.",1474241217.0

Been getting these for a while and have talked to others in my area that have too. Wanted to post about it and see who else here has experience and what other opinions may be.


**Area**: a big city in the Northeast/New England 

**Appearance**: White stamp with an oriental icon and ""China Power"" stamped in red. Powder is very light brown, some small chunks that fall apart upon touch

**Size**: 8/10, pretty consistent with the occasional fatter bag mixed in

**High**: 8/10. Nice rush with longer legs than what I'm used to around here. The rush is strong but lacks the intense pins and needles, which I'm actually glad as some stamps in the area are so intense that it detracts from the experience. Its more of just a strong head and internal body rush/high. These stamps in particular leave me nodding way harder than any I've ever experienced - so much that its like a groggy feeling. This leads me to believe it is cut with a sedative (feels like the benadryl grogginess). I feel pretty indifferent towards this...I prefer a more natural feeling nod but I don't really mind it (as long as I don't really have anything to do). I sleep for like 12 hours if I get real loaded on these at night. If you hear of or see these around, definitely give 'em a try.

My question is, why the hell would a dealer all of a sudden sell me fake pills if I've been a loyal customer? Does he really think I won't know or find out? Especially if they ain't doing shit! I'm really trying to find a logical explaination here, any reason that it's not his fault. That he may not have known they were fake from the source he got it from or something? But I really want to confront him and tell him I ain't buying from him anymore if he's selling me fake pills. But he can deny deny deny if I have no evidence to support it. Any suggestions? 

UPDATE: So I took your guys advice and confronted the dealer. He apologized and sweared up and down that he thought they were real because he took some but it was in combination with other things.

I didn't have a ride and didn't feel like messing with the busses so I called a lyft. It's about a 10 min drive from my house to where I'm meeting my guy. Where we're heading to is a pretty sketchy neighborhood and it's known for drugs. The lyft driver asks me if I'm meeting someone here and I respond with ""yeah, I'm looking at a guys playstation I saw on Craigslist.""  We chat some more, this driver is a really nice guy. He's telling me to be careful when we get there. He also said that if I'm gonna be quick he would wait for me and the ride home would be cheaper than calling a new lyft. So i call my guy up and see where he's at. He's not where he said he was.. Typical. So I ask the driver to bring me a few blocks over and I'll find his house and be right back. OK. We stop, I get out and see my guy playing dice in the street right in front of the car. I ask him if we can go to his car and pretend like I'm looking at your playstation, ok sure. Well the nice ass lyft driver follows me to make sure I'm safe. I grab the bag off the seat and pretend to talk to him for a sec till he says I gotta go. So I get back in my lyft, and the driver asks where the playstation was. I made up some shit about it being a ps3 not a ps4. Then he dropped me off and that's it. Nothing cool or exciting. It was just super awkward and uncomfortable and I wanted to share. K. Thanks 
I just haven't been high in a long time and now I am and I'm rambling. 

TL:DR - Took lyft. Great guy
Got drugs. Very uncomfortable. Went home. Did drugs. ",1474221220.0

Considering they've relapsed every trip to rehab, and every personal attempt at quitting, which there's been multiple, I can see that they simply aren't ready to quit. 

The thing is while I will always support them when they seek it, they often don't. There's always a bridge between our communications regarding the topic and it's only ever touched upon when they want to make it known that they desire to stop. The majority of the time in between those long gaps is always the same struggles seen time and time again.

Currently my sibling is using in plain sight where they have chosen to make their spot of choice the house bathrooms. It's obvious when they use because they always turn on the fan to hide the sound and smell then proceed to nod off for a half hour or more. It's troubling because they've gotten to carefree doing this that they leave tar finger prints over surfaces, obliviously drop paraphernalia tools, have some very shady connects deliver right in front of our home, and most troubling of all have started to steal from the family once again. 

At their worst many years ago my sibling would pawn anything and everything to get their fix, irreplaceable heirlooms, laptops and other electronics, it was a real reality check as my family had only heard about junkies engaging in such activities then out of nowhere experienced it ourselves. My siblings thievery was addressed during that period and they mostly stopped. 

Recently however they became determined to get their hands on xanax, which they are reliant upon, by breaking into our parents room who both have supplies of it. Despite having a girlfriend who has a lucrative job and gives my sibling more money that they probably should, they are still for some reason insistent on stealing it. Our parents room now has a deadbolt on it to prevent access with a card to bypass the standard lock.

The other major quality of life issues my sibling has been determined on continuing is their refusal to provide me with peace and quiet during late hours. Unfortunately the relationship they have with their girlfriend is incredibly conflictual, I can almost always expect to hear them arguing over trivial matters both over the phone and when she comes to our home. While being unable to escape the verbal assault that pierces the wall separating our rooms is unbearable, having to experience it when she's in our home is hell. I can't grasp how someone could go into someone else's home and verbally spar with their partner at late hours, especially after being asked not to. My siblings mood fluctuates depending on how long it's been since they've used, sometimes it seems like they're both looking for a fight and get so emotionally involved in proving their point that they ignore the the fact that they are bothering my family. 

This specific issue has mostly affected me as my parents room is located far enough away that they usually can't hear their arguing but since they argue so often they've inevitably done it in various locations such as the bathroom which did require my parents to request that they stop. Despite my personal attempts at resolving this conflict it still continues. 

What kind of strategy am I going to have to adopt to at least improve my own quality of life as I patiently wait for my sibling to find it within themselves to finally break their habits? ",1474384664.0

Hes given me one last chance so Im gonna quit soon so that I have about 25 days to get clean. Thats not the issue. Basically I smoked weed in my car with my backpack of subs in it. Will the weed smoke cause the strips to9 have THC in them? I know this is a stupid question nd sounds like Im trolling but Im not. I swear, I have OCD and Im worried. I really am ready to clean out now Im worried that it will be all for not cus my strips will have thc in them. My strips were still in wrapper in the pill bottle inside my backpack so obvs I didnt blow smoke on them. Just wondering. Im prepared to be laughed at but just one person tell me Im freaking out for no reason.

Tax is only fair and I respect that, raping your so-called friend ain't cool. 

     Now I have a killer plug that I have amazing credit with so I get fronted on the regular if necessary. King raised Daves price to $100 a bun and he gets nothing til he paid the front back. Without my lick he couldn't afford shit. Guess who starts calling me to middle for him now AND wants to give me 1 stamp for the tax!?!?! I probably spent 8-10k through this dude for myself and friends during the time he was my middle. So literally 4-5k he made off me during that time. Now you want a favor...?  The shitty part is, I'm a nice guy and always help a dope sick brother in need when I can so I help him out when I probably shouldn't have, but I charged him 2 stamps per bun. Chalked it up to the game and I can sleep at night knowing I'm not a dirtbag to my boys (and girls). 

I know it's a long one, but I thought it was a decent story for how I scored my first plug when I got into this shit. 


I did press enter twice and made paragraphs I don't know why my shitty phone does this in multiple fonts and no paragraphs...!??!!

Tl;Dr - middle used to straight rob me, lied about a front and dboy caught him in lie by tracking me down, then former middle needed a middle man after getting cut off...I'm a nicer guy than he ever",1474337811.0

I'm a 26 year old guy who has been hooked on dope for about 4 years now. Been on methadone for a month and haven't touched heroin since August 15. Had a pretty wild experience I'd like to share though. 

About 6-7 months ago I was in pretty bad shape addiction-wise, and I went to what was hopefully the last treatment center I will ever have to be in. After that, which was the first treatment I ever completed (tried rehab about 5-6 times previously), I went south to Florida to live in a sober house. Got a good job cooking in a 5 star restaurant, and within a month I was out of the sober house on my own. Immediately started smoking weed and drinking.

Not too long after, I had a girl I liked down there that was using get me some dope and I sniffed it for a few weeks. Finally I got a hold of some rigs, which are hard to find considering you can't just walk into a pharmacy and buy them down there. From then on I was back in it. 

Now, my roommate was a great guy. Only smoked weed and drank occasionally and we became good friends. He let me move in under the condition I didn't relapse on hard drugs. Well, now I was shooting dope and coke under his nose. This went on for a little while... that is, until the inevitable happened.

I don't remember much from that night, or much after that up until I was finally fully aware of what was going on. Anyway, I went lout with the girl I liked one night for drinks, and when I got home me and my roommate played some video games before I went to bed around 3AM. The next day my roommate woke up around 6AM and saw the cat scratching at my door, which was odd. He knocked on my door and got no answer. When he opened the door, I was on the ground, blue and cold. He tried CPR, but according to him I was dead. He called the ambulance and they took me to the hospital. 

I was in a coma on a respirator for 8 days. I overdosed on heroin, was in kidney failure, liver failure, heart failure, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, had a stroke and had numerous other problems associated with it. The doctors said I had a 25% chance of living, and if I did survive, I would probably have severe brain damage. But, somehow by the grace of God, I survived. I was in the hospital for 17 days. I had to relearn how to walk. Needless to say, it was a scary experience, for me and my family and friends.

But that didn't stop me. I came back home to PA and within a week I was shooting dope again. My friends who were there all left, and most of them are still gone even though I am doing well now. I got back with my girlfriend of almost 6 years who I got into heroin with and let it ruin our relationship. She was doing really good on methadone and I was using behind her back until I couldn't hide it anymore. She gave me an ultimatum, quit or she's leaving me. So I got on methadone and it's been a godsend. We still smoke weed and occasionally some coke/crack but that's it. We are happy and doing well.

Well, enough of my rambling, it's nice to introduce myself to the community. I hope I can help some people with my experience. ",1474308192.0

so, here's the deal: i'm on 130mg/day of methadone. i go to the clinic 1x/week - i give them $82, they dose me, and give me 6 take homes. i usually sell some to off-set the cost, and can pretty easily take 90mg/day without any discomfort.

my boyfriend is on suboxone and only takes about a quarter of what he is prescribed - thus he has a lot of extra pills. i've been on suboxone before and it worked out pretty well - felt almost like being totally sober. but, i wanted to keep shooting dope, so i went on methadone.

at this point i haven't done dope in about 4 years. however - i started drinking about 2 years ago & have been drinking every day, so that’s another thing i’ll need to quit. also, i’ve been taking benzos every day pretty much forever, but i have an Rx that my Dr could call in to any pharmacy, so that shouldn’t be a problem. i’m also on gapabentin & wellbutrin, but, again, those are meds i could pick up from any pharmacy. plus, i could go without or titrate down to a minuscule dose if need be.

i want to hitchhike up to the protest camp as soon as possible, and am trying to figure out how to do that without being sick. obviously, i fucking hate being sick. i also fucking hate the cold, but i really want to do this thing. it’s about a 1,500 mile trip, i could probably get there in three days or less.

anyhow: guest-dosing does not seem like a viable option. so far, my plan is to go as low as i can on my methadone in the next 3-7 days, then stop taking it completely, & when i start feeling sick, switch to suboxone. then i can take my boyfriends stash (he’s totally lovingly supporting my plan, btw) as well as (hopefully) getting an Rx of my own - that way i'll have enough pills to get through at least a month, probably several (i have no idea how long i'll stay at the protest site, & there's a possibility that i'll travel further.)

my main question is: how many mg of methadone should i be taking right before i switch to suboxone, & what would be a good detox schedule? i've experienced having a habit so high that suboxone didn't do anything (i'm probably at that now.)

even more importantly:

do any of you have a better idea?

I've made an earlier post on /r/Entrepreneur relating to this subject before I knew of all the political decisions that the superintendent and board of my school was making. For a full idea of the topic at hand, I recommend briefly skimming this thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/53gqd0/im_17_and_want_to_create_a_nonprofit_or_something/

This went from me trying to be entrepreneurial and involved with the school to now actively opposing them in their horrible, life-risking choices now causing me to *take action* in attempt to fix this.

After writing and posting the thread on /r/Entrepreneur, the advice was absolutely amazing and feedback phenomenal, but a lot of issues arose the day after at school that I was not expecting at all regarding the heroin epidemic in my school. After speaking with the psychologists who run SADD in our school (my Business Club which I founded and run is partnered with them. WISE services also works with us too), they notified me behind closed doors  that (indirectly) due to the conservative nature of the town and the prestige of my school, they do NOT offer Narcan (opioid antagonist) and have NOT taught Narcan training to even the *nurses* if a child were to a child to overdose. To better understand my school, nurses aren't even allowed to carry and offer condoms if a child were in the the dire need to ask for one, like a band-aid. A simple thing like that is disapproved and fought against by the board. 

The school and town itself is extremely conservative and we have a very high reputation as one of the best high schools on Long island. They are preventing bringing Narcan into the school because they don't want to make it seem like it's an issue, even though heroin is an issue ALL over Nassau and Suffolk (counties of Long Island). I'm not asking for a task force dedicated to this in my school (which some actually do on LI), but just simply *Narcan*. If a child were to OD in our school, they'd need to call the police and then by the time the policeman got there with a Narcan kit the child would be dead. This is seen time and time again, and that's why most schools now on Long Island at the very LEAST carry Narcan, if not a TASK FORCE DEDICATED to this issue, which some schools around me have.

This, to me, is a major flaw in the administration to keep prestige and reputation over the risk of my peers and students' dying from a possible opioid OD. I want to contact the board of education and discuss the [NYSED guidelines and regulations](http://www.schoolhealthny.com/files/filesystem/guidance%20on%20opioid%20overdose%20prevention%20in%20the%20schools%20final.pdf) about opioids and attempt to reasonably get Narcan in my school. Basically, this document gives schools the full right to choose whether to carry Narcan or not. This makes it a ""district boards of education and school governing bodies"" issue that I would need to tackle, and if they are forceful about not changing the policies, then maybe I should go down and about with my more harsh approach.

Firstly, I've been thinking about contacting politicians - particularly Edward P. Mangano - who I believe would be very happy to reply to my issue regarding this (once I get officially released statistics and more information regarding this in my area).

Secondly, I want to contact an organization(s) focusing on this Long Island heroin epidemic that's trying hard to get Narcan out there (fyi - Narcan costs ~$20-$70 to save someone's life during an OD; a police recovery and hospitalization for an OD costs ~$30,000 of tax payers money). Once I have backing from politicians, organizations, and maybe even recovering heroin addicts on Long Island or family members who've lost their kids to OD, then I want to contact either Newsday, NY Times, or any newspaper that'll be interested in running the story on this (and they WILL run the story with the way I'd explain it + the backing of officials I would have + child political/social activism. I've gotten stories ran before so I know the deal with writers for papers, however on a smaller, more local paper - nothing HUGE like this *could* possibly be). By running the story, it will put pressure on my school to act now or suffer more exposure on the topic, even after being confronted.

Do you have advice regarding this? This indeed is political and social activism on a high school campus, but this sort of thing is usually done in college by leading students getting involved. I'm taking a very big step here in HIGH SCHOOL and I need to be prepared (which I plan to be). I will also get a more detailed account of exactly how we would deal with a hypothetical heroin OD at my school from the health officials and psychologists I've been working with and found this info from originally anyways.

Running an article on activism at my age in high school with me leading for a chance can do some very powerful things for my community. It shows young influence and also improving the future the community. Quite possibly,  some big names can get involved if done correctly. Leadership regarding innovating for social change goes a far, far way, and I am determined and care about this topic.

Anyways, thank you very much for your time reading. Any future responses will be deeply beneficial. :)",1474424896.0

I guess I'll just say this and let it be done – I still love you. I always will ,I think. Everyone I've been with since you has fallen apart because they aren't you, So, at least that is said.

I don't fault you. Not one bit, not for one second. I really do want you to know that. My failings aren't yours. I know you had a hard line on drug use… I guess I thought I could keep it hidden.

But did you really think I was paying all our bills with… What? I remember handing you $500 in used twenties and tens and telling you to get groceries. Where did you think all the cash was coming from?

I guess it doesn't matter now. A decade later… No – a decade plus. Jesus.

I wish you knew how I tried to protect from the worst of it. The days I spent in front of the toilet to only dose before you came home. The days I spent kicking heroin to appear sober to you. It doesn't matter now… Twelve, thirteen years on.

I hope you're happy… I call your new husband a discount version of me, but that's nor fair. He's not a junkie fuck up is he?

I guess you remember the fight, right? Me, drunk on wine and creme de menthe, you coming home to nothing… No dinner, dirty apartment. I don't remember who dropped the hammer first – me saying, “I. Don't Need. You.” or you calling me a “fat, loser, junkie.” At any rate… I did need you, Still do, I suppose, Still do. The night ended with me on the phone to my father, begging him to come rescue me… And ten days later I was gone….

Do you know what happened in those ten days? No, I don't suppose you do… Did you wonder how the rent was paid for the next four months? The cash left in the envelope on that stupid fucking kitchen island you bought at IKEA? 

A decade-plus – so much is in the past but I still dream about it… But sometimes I dream about you, and that makes the nightmares worth it.

I'm sorry. There's the heart of it. I have a decade of letters, mostly written once a month, that say that. The choices I made, the things I did… I did what I thought was best. It was the wrong choice. I guess I know that now, years along… I remember a time when I thought,. “If I do this… I'm lost,” and well, I did it. Time and time again. I still do.

I guess I'll get to the point, eh?

I'm sorry… For so, so much. But not for those ten lost days between Dad coming in and us leaving. Not that, never that. Those days, I suppose they define me still. I still run from them. I still run towards them.

I hope you're happy. Fulfilled. I hope you never think of me.

And I will never send this.

My entire left forearm immediately was covered in not hives but those raised bubbles from my skin, kinda like poison ivy, the typical raising you get from missing. The tip of my left index finger immediately went blood red. I have since kept my left arm raised above my heart and the swelling went down but not completely, my index finger is still blood red. The bumps have also gone down but not significantly. The pain has subsided but when i clench my left fist it still hurts like hell. I emptied the rest of the dope/crack mix into another rig and shot into my right arm, it went in smoothly but I felt no effects. Does anyone have any idea what happened?

53pkdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/53pkdw/subtleties_of_withdrawals/,2,https://redd.it/53pkdw,nodjersey,Subtleties of withdrawals,"Hey everyone,

I was just wondering if any of you experience subtle, yet noticeable, symptoms after a mild binge or in PAWS.  Middle and early August I was using a good amount of blues on and off trying to avoid regularity and daily use to the best of my ability. I stopped taking them and felt a little ""off"" for a while, lack of energy, irritability, cravings, etc. but nothing too intense or noticeable.  

A week ago today I gave into those cravings and picked up 3 buns, which I finished by Saturday evening.  Sunday my university had a big party and I drank and ended up having a good day, aside from some trouble sleeping Sunday night.  Yesterday I felt kinda shitty and didn't have much motivation and then I got a terrible sleep last night, tossing and turning until 5am despite smoking a good amount of weed.  Today I feel worse than yesterday, even less motivation, slightly uncomfortable, and mild diarrhea.

My question is: does this sound like typical withdrawals to everyone here?  I've been dabbling with opiates for a while now but have only experienced withdrawals on a few occasions and definitely am not familiar with them.  I feel shitty and would like either some reassurance that this is withdrawals and will pass or to be told that this isn't opiate related. 

Thanks guys and any input is appreciated. ",1474404746.0

(really long rant/story),"I see people on here talking about selling their shit to pawn shops and it breaks my heart to see people getting ripped off.

Pawn shops are the bottom of the barrel for selling ANYTHING. I've sold to a pawn shop only once, a long time ago, but occasionally I've brought stuff in to try and sell. All of the things I've read online about ""half of the lowest price they find online"" and things like that have been way high in my experience. Every time I've tried, it's more like 10-20%.

 For example I had a guitar that I got as a gift for my ex (she felt bad that she never used it so she let me keep it when we broke up, cool girl actually.), sold for about $250 new, used you could probably find it for about half that. here's the story

Entering withdrawal, getting the teary eyes and yawns but no restlessness and shits yet. So I called one of a few pawn shops that was open on a Sunday, told them about it, said no scratches, hardly been touched, just some fingerprint smudges, excellent condition (100% truth). Gave them model number etc. he told me over the phone ""as long as it's in the condition you describe we can give you around $100 for it"". hey that's reasonable.

so I drive over, bring it in, I guess he figured if I bothered to come in I was determined to sell it to them since not many places were open on a Sunday. So he tells me ""oooh you didn't tell me it was BLACK. yeah people really don't buy these in black, plus these smudges probably aren't gonna come off[WTF? they wipe off in two seconds], I dunno man. I feel bad that you drove out here, I'll give you $50 store credit or $40 cash"". I was so shocked I just stood there for a second, and then I'm like ""you...sure about that?"" and he just nods. ""and I've got so many guitars already"" he motions to the guitar rack where there's THREE guitars, two acoustic (mine was electric), realizes he's an idiot and says, ""...in the back"". I just grabbed it and walked out.

Tried the other two pawn shops waaay on the other side of town, one said 120, the other said 80, both offered less than half of what they told me over the phone. I guess sometimes its a good thing that when I'm sick I get really angry at stuff, so angry that I refused to sell to these pieces of shit even though I needed to get well.

So I went sick that night, once night came and everything was closed I was able to get some generic imodium and make it through the night. Well in the morning I took it to an actual music store, he looked at it and I felt so vindicated, he said ""we don't get many of these in this good of shape, you should probably sell this on ebay or craigslist, you could get really close to the price of brand new, if you did want to sell it to us I could only offer $140"". I had to stop myself from smiling and jumping up and down. I told him I really needed the money ASAP. He honestly looked like he felt guilty to ""only"" give me the 140.

Anyway, I remember these couple days well, I got a hell of a deal from my dude, he was getting out of the business and I got 2 grams of some really clean, fire dope for that 140. If I had bought the day before I would have gotten much less for the same cash. So while that night I was sick sucked a lot, it ended up being for the best.

Lately I have been reading that there has been many fakes coming out of Philly and I think I was lucky enough to receive some. I got about 20 a215s a few days ago, the girl that i usually get them from fronted me them which is the first thing that is weird about the situation. The pill is the same exact color as an a215 should be, nothing weird there, except the imprint on every single one of the pills is a bit worn off. That was the fiest sign. When i had questioned the girl about this and she had told me that she stockpiles the pills and sometimes moisture gets into the bottle and rubs off a little bit of the pill. I gave her the benefit of the doubt but I told her if that was the case no other part on the pill is like that only the imprint. The pill tastes like chalk it is absolutely disgusting to snort, the drip tastes like a mixture between flowers and cologne. When I had confronted her about that she had told me that the pills were sitting next to her boyfriend's bottle of cologne. Seems like she has an answer for everything doesn't it!? I just can't figure this out because I am getting high off of them. I mean not the type of high that I normally would get when I take these pills but I am not sick. I mean I am not getting incredibly fucked up And the rush I should be getting but I feel pretty decent. A215s are my favorite because out of all 30s this make me feel the most hyper and uppity. This batch of that makes me feel pretty dopey, I feel like I am nodding out from most of these pills. I have read a few forums that say that fakes have an incredible burn when you snort them and these don't burn it all. But I've had numbness in the back of my throat it's severe dry mouth from taking these. I have been blowing my nose a lot more and ass gross as this sound even my snots don't look right, it's almost like I am blowing the pill right back out of my nose and it's like a gluey substance. I am at a crossroads now because unfortunately I still owe this girl the money but I don't want to pay for something that is fake. I have confronted her at least three times now about my concerns and she just seems to brush it off and say ""well they are real"" If they are fakes what is in this pill that is getting me high or at least to a similar feeling of a real oxycodone!?",1474393940.0

Anybody seeing this will know. I just...need some sort of security I guess and I don't want all my dirty laundry aired out onto a drug forum. You know...other than my frequent drug and alcohol abuse. But I digress. 

I am married. I am working on a divorce which is supposed to be amicable, and I already have someone getting the forms ready for me. And because I'm ""insolvent"" or ""destitute"" or whatever fancy word you want to use for ""broke as shit"". I can get a divorce for essentially free.

So, basically, nobody wants this (my soon to be ex-husband) person around. They have burned every bridge, and his family sucks, he has no support system, his aunts won't answer, though they've never tried to help. My dad and I are pretty much the only one's who have been there to help him since he was 18/19. With his mom in between, the self-righteous, lying cunt bucket. But I digress. He is 26 now, with a birthday in a few months. I can't have him here. I left him for a reason, and I was *finally* starting to feel like myself, even though I still struggle from time to time with with good 'ole Henry myself. I do have a support system though. One, that he once had, but he doesn't have anymore. He was never supposed to stay here. You give a mouse a cookie and he wants a glass of milk, kind of shit. But my dad is more forgiving then I and let him stay the weekend, if he promised to get help and go to a program. My dad found free programs, that I'm sure aren't very fun, but they are there. He doesn't want to go. He wants to kill himself, because he says he has no one left. And truthfully, he kinda does right now, yeah. He fucked up. He always fucks up. He somehow managed to find a job yesterday that will pay him $15/hr under the table, in between going to the hospital for a ruptured eardrum yesterday, and getting high (because he's in pain, yeah yeah. I get it.) Fucker was always good at finding jobs. So he says he's going to work one day and then kill himself with the money. He says this with some sense of solace, though I don't think he wants to die. He obviously wants to survive or why would he bother getting antibiotics and a job? 

However, that's not the problem. The problem is the guy that hired him, apparently has a kid in the hospital and so he's probably not going to be there today. Which means, guess who is calling me? And I can't have him here another night, the emotional strain it puts on me and my father is too much, and we're both tired of getting taken advantage of. But there's always a reason for ""one more day"" or ""one more night"" and I don't know what to do. This isn't how this was supposed to go. His clothes are still here. His mess is still here (he is messy as fuck, and I'm not exactly neat, so it just wreaks havoc on everything, bc I get too depressed to clean it up.) I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave him on the street like this, but what can I do anymore? It's been 8 years. 8 years, and I was finally starting to feel like myself, I thought that maybe it could be okay between me and him, but its just not. It's all wrong. And he will see this and be upset. I love him, I always will, but it is a different kind of love. Maybe one that hurts more. A sad love. 

So I ask you r/opiates, what would you do? Would you let him back in for just ""one more day""? If I let him in now, he's not going to leave. He'll end up staying the night, and then who knows what the next catastrophe will be. Most likely a pick line and a defibrillator. But it can't be my problem anymore.

I read a post on here the other day about not quitting when you've run out of dope.  I've been keeping my withdrawals at bay the past week with oxycontin (oral), and managed with around 40 - 60mg per day  I've just restocked with enough heroin for around a week, and i'm 100% positive that I really don't want to carry on with this habit.   

I'm on roughly 0.25 - 0.5g a day, smoking only.

I'm starting to fall into the junkie lifestyle, only thinking about my next hit, trying to find money anyway possible, not eating, waking up in the night to use etc.

I used to enjoy using, and the feeling I got from heroin, but there's no enjoyment anymore and I really think i'm ready to be done with it.

I realise my habit isn't too bad compared to a lot of people on here, but i'd really like to nip it in the bud now.

I've tried cold turkey, but the withdrawals beat me every time.  The physical symptoms are bad enough (RLS, Nausea, Stomach cramps, sweats)   but it's the mental side that's making it impossible for me.    I already suffered with depression, anxiety, PTSD and BPD before using, and when I try to stop it's just unbearable.  The suicidal thoughts, intrusive thoughts etc make it impossible to stay clean.

I don't want to go through the local drug advisory service (I'm in the UK so I think that's the only way to get on subutex / suboxone / methadone) and i'm terrified that if I tell my GP that they'll take away my driving license (is that what happens in the UK?)  My mum is really sick and relies on me for lifts, and I live in the middle of nowhere so no transport anywhere. 

I can buy buprenorphine from the darknet and thought about trying the quick taper - 1mg every hour only when the withdrawal symptoms get too bad.   Has anyone had success with this?

If not, can anyone recommend how much buprenorphine to take for a 0.25g a day habit? Would 2mg be high enough or too high?

The other option is to try tapering down using codeine, but I tried that in the past and it didn't work out so well.  

Any advice, tips, support would be very much appreciated as I'm truly scared but ready to end this way of life.

But, instead aggressively going after the drug dealers who sold the dope that caused the overdose. 

If everything they say ends up happening, then cheers to the government for actually finally doing something!",1474545863.0

-

How long do you have to take it before you get withdrawals? I only take it about twice a week tops, before it was closer to 1800mg id take, but yesterday for example i took it staggered throughout the WHOLE day, totalling prob ~3,600mg..

-

I also take phenibut about once every 4 days. I think im really starting to play with fire.

-

Ive only been doing this for a month and a half (i first started getting gabapentin 6 months ago but only took it twice ever and was just hoarding all of them, so needless to say ive got quite a surplus.

-

Im not taking any of those ones i saved though; thats just my backup for opiod withdrawal

-

**Tl;dr-**
-

1) how many consecutive days of using gabapentin (1.5-4 gram) before you risk withdrawal

-

2) does phenibut & gabapentin rotation have cross tolerance and therefore compounding risk of dependency (and consequently less effects? Seems to be the case for phenibut, but that could also be because 1.5g phenibut 2x a week alone would cause the tolerance ive gotten, as phenibut alone is notorious for rapid tolerance and lesser effects)

Around 5 years ago a couple of my friends (Bren and Dave) started using heroin. As a friendship group where we had all used lots of different drugs, but never opiates - we were pretty negative about it and held a friend intervention where we asked them to stop. They had each other to back each other up at this meeting and they pretty much laughed it off and told us we didn't know what we were talking about. 

Over the next few years they continued to use and developed a dependency, we informed their parents hoping this would motivate them to change, but it didn't and a couple years ago Dave died.

Since then Bren has been on a subutex script and later a methadone script. We thought it was all good, but over the last few months we suspect that both Bren and his girlfriend who he lives with ( and who is quite young, 24) might be using again. We want to help them. But when we try and talk about it, they deny it strongly and get very angry and now I don't know what to believe. 

Here is what I know. 1) They have been signed off work with 'anxiety' they have been off work for about 6 months 2) They told each of their parents (falsely) that the they have no money and are receiving around 3.5k GBP a month (about 5k USD) from various sources, they do not buy expensive clothes, or other material goods.  2) Bren is reclusive, does not meet up with friends, is unreliable and distant from his family 3) His brother told me 'Bren keeps falling asleep at the table' ie nodding off 4) In the evening when visiting friends they often say that they have to leave around 10pm to meet friends... this is untrue. Bear in mind this is someone who used to be the life and soul of the party staying up late and always hanging out with friends. 5) Bren and his girlfriend will not let anyone visit their flat, even when friends and family are outside.

I think that all of this points to addiction... But they both flatly deny it and tell us we don't know what is going on. Am I going crazy? What is the next step we can take as a family/friend group to best help them? ",1474536675.0

53y1yx,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/53y1yx/getting_fucked/,21,https://redd.it/53y1yx,SlickStyle,Getting Fucked,"I know from the title you guys are probable thinking I went G4P. But this is something completely different. Now I live and an area of the NW US where dope is extremely expensive. The cheapest point I've gotten is about 20$ and I've been doing dope for almost 3 years. Most of the time I have paid 40$ for a point. That's pretty standard 40$ a point. I should've gotten fed up a long time ago but today is the day I'm finally fed up.

I posted on here a week or two ago about how my buddy I've known since high school burned 80$ from me. I've recently talked to him and he told me that night he got a DUI and that he would pay me back. I only have two connects and they are both middlemen (80$ burner being one of them who we'll call J from now on). I went through him for 2 more hook ups. One for two points (80$) and one for one point (40$). I know people are probably saying I'm an idiot but oh well what else do I do? The 2 point deal looked alright but the 1 point deal he literally gave me a sliver. I knew it didn't weigh but I was desperate so I took it. Get home throw it on my scale and it doesn't even register. Now my scale is kind of cheap so I text him about it. He asked how much it weighed out too and I told him it weighed to half a point thinking that it would be better than saying it didn't register. Well he never texts me back and so I'm like whatever chalk it up to the game. Call him today and he says he can get me the 80$ on Friday. 

So today I go through my other connect (who's an old friend and I truly believe would not fuck me over) and I wanted 4 points. So I give him my 160$ and he goes out to dudes house. 2 things happen:

1. He calls me about 45 minutes later with: ""so a little change of plans dude. The guy has my half g but he has to go re up to get your 4."" So at this point I'm freaking out a little and really fucking mad. My buddy (who we will call M from now on) had texted this dude and told him exactly what we wanted. Which means this dude said roll through knowing he would have to pick up to fulfill this order but neglected to tell M this because he wanted the business. Ok ok I get that. Cunt move but I get that. It took about 3 hours but he calls me and says he's on his way. I get excited as fuck. 

2. He gets back to my house and I throw that chunk on the scale and it weighs to .24. M throws his chunk on there and it weighs to about .2. M quickly tells me he did about half of his when he was at dudes house while he waited for him to re up. I've always been a little iffy about my scale and it honestly looked like 4 points so I shrug it off and get high. I already paid the money, I already got fucked, and I might as well get high. When you're paying 40$ a point even getting shorted a little bit is a huge fucking deal but I'm trying to convince myself it's just the scale and it looks like 4 but whatever. About 20 minutes ago I wanted to figure out if my scale was accurate and I thought of an idea. I looked up what the weight of a paper American dollar is which is about a gram. Tare out my scale and throw a dollar on there. Weighs to exactly a gram. I immiediately text M and tell him my scale was accurate and to see if that guy will make it right. My intuition has not been on point lately but I truly feel like M would not fuck me over. I've known him since high school and I lent him 40$ about 3 months ago (when I was clean and actually had money) and when I asked for it back he got it back to me immiediately. So I really do think this is on the dealer. M said he had problems with weight before with this guy and he made it back to him because the weight was under.

Now I start thinking about all the points that J has sold me and how weak they looked and how much I've gotten fucked. Then I think about the fact that J probably gets his points for 30$ and realizing that on top of that he has been pinching the shit that he's gotten me. So I'm gonna get my 80$ back that he owes me and tell him to fuck off and never call me ever again. I have known this guy since early high school. I always thought he was looking out for me and helping me out when he could. I now know that's not the truth. 

Recently figured out the dark net and will be doing all my purchases through there from now on:) I know you guys probably think I'm the dumbest fuck alive and I should've opened my eyes earlier, but I'm happy I'm at least making a move away from these greedy horrible dealers now. 

/end rant. 

TL;DR: I have been getting fucked over hard by one of my buddy's I've known since high school. Didn't want to believe it (I mean this dude would come over, drink beers with me, and just kick it. We were on good terms) so I shoved my head in the sand because that was one of the only connects I have. Recently figured out the DNM and finally confronted the fact that I'm getting screwed over constantly for probably a decent chunk of cash from my buddy (J). I'm a fucking idiot I know. I don't plan on getting anything of what I'm owed from these fucking people ripping me off besides the knowledge that I'm done buying on the street in my fucking state and I'm just going DNM from now on.

I was  happy to hear the other day that in 14 states CVS will allow the purchase of naloxone nasal spray without a prescription. While my home state was not one of those lucky few, South Carolina was, and I live a bout a 30 minutes drive from.the border. 

If I visit a SC CVS can I purchase narcan and bring it back home with me, or will they deny me the purchase since they will know I'll just take it somewhere I'm not allowed to have it?

Also, do I have to provide ID to get narcan? I'd rather not have the same pharmacy that gives me pain medication for my ulcerative colitis label me a junkie and cease giving it to me. I only get a small dose of demerol every month, but when I have a really bad episode or ate something that irritates my inflammation, I'd be forced to crying and shitting blood for hours without relief. I also have a script for adderall and a benzo that I do not abuse and take as prescribed, and I don't want my pharmacy to assume that my affinity for opioids makes me the type of person who would abuse anything I could get my hands on and deny me those meds too, especially when they help my mental condition so much.

And does anyone know how much a CVS sells them for? I don't want to use my insurance for two reasons. 1st is I don't want to be labeled a ""high risk customer"" by the company and have my rates jacked up, and secondly is because I'm young enough to still be on my parent's insurance, and since our insurance somehow notifies them of all medicines I take, I don't want them finding out I'm an opioid abuser

I've been using for 2 and a half years now, since I graduated high school, and have never had any major withdrawals, and until 3 weeks ago, no overdoses. I vastly underestimated the potency of the drug of the night, and while I was nodding pretty heavily I just sat there  and wished I had some narcan. I tried to go to bed but I didn't quite make it and I fell asleep on the floor with my neck in such an awkward position that I lost all of my ability to move my right arm. It's all better now thankfully but that was scary and I really want to get my hands on some narcan nose spray (I'm too afraid to IV myself). The mods seemed ok with sourcing naloxone on this subreddit, so if anyone knows of any other sources easier than going to South Carolina or if that idea will even work, I would appreciate the nudge in the right direction so I could get some.

If I was mistaken in what the mods told me and discussing narcan sources directly is not allowed, just ignore that part. I still am curious about the legality and requirements of getting narcan in South Carolina is.

Heartbroken,"Sorry in advance for the legnth of this post... It's a long story... I don't expect even half of you to read this novel but for those that do thank you so much!

I've been with my S/O for 5 years on and off, but mostly on. Our love has been the strongest and truest either of us has ever had, and we both want marriage and children in the future. We have never in the past dealt with any cheating problems, have always been ride or die and the best of friends too, going through some serious ups and downs together and watching eachother's careers grow.

As far as drugs go, about 3 years ago we both went to rehab for bad dope problems (when we met him I was totally sober and he would only drink lean once in awhile but I did have a history with opiates). After rehab, I stayed clean, he did not. Over the next two years his using was a constant argument between us, and he tried detoxing and getting clean more times than I can count, a lot of them with me trying to nurse him back to health with no avail, even over important holidays like Christmas... I slept every night knowing there was dope in the house and still didn't use. All I wanted was to help him get clean so he could be free and we could have a brighter future together. 

Well, after two years of staying strong for myself and for him, I got overwhelmed and lost it one day. I relapsed.

I slipped up for a month and then put myself through rehab to get back to sobriety. During that time I told my S/O that when I left rehab, if he was still using, I couldnt see him anymore until he got help, because being around him using was killing me and I loved him too much to watch him kill himself anymore. The day I left rehab I found out he was still using and left him. I found him a scholarship to a sober living house and outpatient rehab/counseling and told him the day he was ready to go for it, I was by his side but until then I had to stay away. I also offered to pay for medications he needed, including a vivatrol shots that he wanted.

A month went by, and he would text me telling me how bad he wanted to get clean, for himself, for us. He also told me that he had started doing speedballs (he had only done heroin alone before that).  I was devastated things were getting worse.. It was all talk no walk. 
During that time I heard through the grapevine that he found a new drug dealer, a woman.

Also during that time his best friend and mother started calling me, asking for my help because they were scared at how bad he was getting and didnt know what to do. I caved in after a month apart and went to his house to see if he was ok. I was so worried and also desperately missed my best friend and love of my life. 
We started spending time together again and I immediately felt something off when it came to his new dealer. He would go over to her house to use for hours at a time and also started helping her shoot up (she only smoked for years before that). They'd hang out doing speedballs together and it made me extremely uncomfortable. I asked him to stop using her and go to a different dealer (we both know several, dope is easy to find where we live). He said he would but I kept catching him going back to her. He swore it was just because she was close and cheap. I started to feel like they were too close and for the first time in 5 years worried he was cheating. I called her and threatened her (I admit not my best moment but I was desperate for us both to be sober and she was a lingering problem that wouldn't go away). 
After huge arguments about her happened over and over he finally told her he was getting clean and he wouldn't be around anymore. She responded by blowing up his phone and constantly calling him to ask for advice about her health. I saw this as a huge red flag. This was more than just a dealer, and if they weren't romantic then they were at the very least close friends at this point. I felt confused and hurt... I had begged him to make me feel more comfortable by disconnecting from her and buying dope from one of our other dealers, but in the end he never stopped going to her and wouldn't let me come with, claiming she felt threatened by me... She threatened me back, telling me she knew my address and I was again, devastated, because he didn't even stick up for me. He stuck up for her claiming if I wouldn't have started drama with her in the first place she wouldn't have threatened me. I felt beyond hurt... After five years I would've hoped he'd have my back..

I recently went away for work (I travel weekly for my job). When I got back his hair was braided and he told me about how a friend of a friend had done it. I told him it looked great. I see her calling him from another number (also weird and shady) and text her fuck off and leave him alone. She responded to me with ""ask him who braided his hair"". I was devastated. He immediately pulled the braids out and apologized over and over for lying. He said she had offered to braid his hair and he really wanted the braids for an event he went to (we both are in the entertainment industry). He said it was nothing and that I should stop freaking out, that he had never so much as flirted with this woman.

To this day I feel like something is off but he gets furious when I bring it up and I have no idea what happened or is happening. I have been out of the country for work for the last couple of weeks so for all I know they're together right now...

I've always trusted him but the drugs have changed him from the most honest guy I'd ever met to someone that lies so easily it scares me. 

The worst part? I asked her point blank on a text- ""have you and him been together?"" and her response was ""maybe"". He justifies this by saying I threatened her when I was trying to get her to leave him alone (I did- she has multiple children and I said she had no right being a mother- this was out of anger and I regret being so harsh- it was just gross to see her syringes next to her kids toys the one time I went over there). Ugh, I'm ashamed at myself for even having gotten to this place..

Right before I left out of town he asked me for help getting clean and I paid a lot of money to send him to another detox/sober living/rehab and he left and didn't finish the program when things got rough.. I had to hear from the rehab that he left because he never even bothered to call and tell me himself. Ugh... I hate what this addiction does to people, to relationships, to me..

I need some outside perspective because I  have felt too ashamed to talk to any of my friends about it. Do you guys/girls think he has something going on with his dealer?  Thank you for taking the time to read this, it took me being incredibly sad and hurt to write something like this online. I am ashamed and beside myself...

""*When high on opium the experience of emotions of pure joy and elation that came from having attained no actual achievement were so profound that they were stored in the memory like they were inspired by peak life event experiences so important that they were never to be forgotten. Just sitting on the couch playing a car racing game for instance, or watching music videos in the early morning darkness and fighting off sleep to drain from the experience just a few more moments of the heart's beaten jolts of pleasure were riveting memories artificially enhanced to the mind by the flow of endorphin-like chemicals. I think this is part of the drug's psychologically addictive nature because it creates these unnaturally fantastic scenarios out of what could be without the drug effects seen as from the purely doldrum and routine.*""

For me, at least, this perfectly describes one of the most powerful aspects of opiates, which ensnared me in addiction quickly. This can happen at any stage of the addiction but is especially prominent early on -- I remember the first week I smoked BTH years ago, how just nodding off to shitty reality television seemed like a transcendent experience both at the time and as stored in memory.

I guess this relates back to the whole ""chasing the dragon"" concept: you're always chasing some high in particular, it may have been the first time or the first time you shot up or it may be that one time last month or it may have been 5 years ago... but it's as if the experience of getting high is inextricably linked to nostalgia itself, it's a kind of attempted recreation of some past perceived glory. And it's so very hard to have the current experience live up to the greatness of the old one. But hey, if I just keep on doing it maybe next time I'll get as euphoric and high as I did that one time. So you keep chasing it, going around in circles. On and on.

And it's (obviously) a hard cycle to break, because typically the process of chasing that perfect high still results in you getting high all the time -- maybe not as high as The Best Time, but still nice and toasted. It's so very easy to just continue doing this, and to be content not doing much else in life. I remember an addict I used to know who said that the worst thing about opiates was that they made boredom acceptable and even desirable. At the time, as an early, on-off junkie who was fiending badly but without a connect, I just got irritated at him and brushed the comment off. Today, as a junkie who's been on subs for a few years and still treats them like any other opiate in terms of ""addict behavior""... I find I couldn't agree more with him. Nothing is more dangerous than embracing that boredom and inaction and complete apathy toward anything besides dope.",1474525057.0

We meet and I get in his car andi immediately notice his right eye is swollen as fuck.  I asked him what happened, and he said he got jumped by some ""white supremacist skinheads"" for his dope and money, but said that they ""didn't get shit"".  

So I tell him I'm getting a gram and I give him $140.  Dude doesn't have his scale on him, so he eyeballs it and hands it to me.  It look like probably 3/4 of a gram at best, and I tell him this.  He says to weigh it when I get home, and if it's under, he'll make it right.  So I do, and it's at .54.  I call him and he says he'll make it right when he makes it into town later.  I'm with my girl most of the evening, meaning I can't pick up.  We play phone tag for a few hours, and finally I get ahokd of him around 8:30 and he says he's already in for the night but that he tried to get ahold of me a few times.  I get off work at 2 tomorrow and we're supposed to meet up then.  
Dude is always on point aside from this time, and I do honestly do think he will make it right tomorrow.  Still, it's really frustrating to already be paying $140 for a fucking gram, and then to get shorted damn near half of that.  

For what its worth, its the best tar to come my wat in a LONG time.  I did a .2 shot around 2pm and I'm still nodding on and off and it's 11:15pm.  Working the market tomorrow morning and afternoon, which is easy money and I have a fat shot for the morning.  Sorry for the long post.

Hit some backs Sunday morning, got sick as fuck Monday then I got some Xanax bars to help take the edge off.  Well after I took one of those, reason kind of went out the window.  I didn't buy any more dope but I had saved a fuck ton of old cottons that I washed and I actually had enough to keep me well through Wednesday afternoon and still had more left.

Anyway, after I washed must have been 10-15 old cottons in one shot and actually got a pretty good buzz from it I came to my senses and realized I needed to be clean by the time I start work Monday so I flushed all the rest of my cottons.

So what do you think?  If I don't take anything (besides the xanax bars and lope I have to ease w/d's) should I be at least functional for work on Monday?

EDIT:  Coming off about a half gram a day BTH habit.  Quality is mediocre at best, I'm sure I would be using much less if I had decent #4 available.

EDIT 2:  I do have subs as a backup plan.  I've tried to get clean by using them before but failed.  I would take 8-16mg like 24-36 hours after my last dose and they didn't do shit all.

I eventually answer and it’s an old dope dealer. Fast forward to December 15 – running out of money (savings, checking regularly empty, but bills are still paid). I start getting dope sick worse than ever before. I lose my job in January because I couldn’t get to work. Call me a pussy, but I was dope sick as fuck and figured I could find a job, so I kept calling in, and eventually, the leash tightened to a noose and they canned me.

Fast forward to today – I’m still unemployed, savings is empty, and I’m trying desperately to get back on suboxone.   I have a family member whos been on it for years, and she gives me one strip every Friday. Some weeks I make it last, some weeks I don’t.  This week is one of those weeks. I took the last sliver of sub at about 6am today. I have about 5g of kratom left for the morning, and then I don’t know what I ‘m going to do.  The last shot of dope I did was Monday 2am. The withdrawal has been fairly tolerable with my slivers of sub and kratom, though still unpleasant.  (Up until 2 months ago, I was probably a 1g/day user – been getting far less since – out of money – so maybe doing .5 every 3 days).  I see why the withdrawals have been tolerable – I’ve vastly decreased my dose.

So why am I pissed off? I’m (relatively) clean.  I just keep fucking myself with thoughts of trying to get clean, then completely falling off the wagon and fucking up.  I said I am averaging half a g every 3 days. Well that’s completely average. Some days I get 7 days clean time, through no desire of my own, and then I go and keep resetting the cycle.  

I’ll be honest – I have a family – I love my kids and I love my wife. I want to get clean. I want to be the IT professional I was. I want to be able to buy my 7 year old a fucking Wii U again (that I pawned in the first place).

It’s late Wednesday night. I’ve burned every bridge I have dope wise, except one.  He owes me a g. He’s been stringing me along for 2 weeks, and I know I’m not going to get it unless I buy a second (my rationale is – he wont give it to me unless he gets something in return).  I am on 3 different waiting lists for sub, apparently the government upping sub patients to 275 didn’t help enough, around here at least.   I’m so tired of this game. I just want to feel normal again.  I am running out of resources and, I think more importantly, I am running out of will.  I have a beautiful and smart 7 year old boy, a gorgeous 7 month old girl, and a beautiful 29 year old wife.  I (thankfully) still have my house, power, water, internet. Oh, and my 2 kitties. I can’t forget them.

Fuck.  If you made it this far, I appreciate you. Even if you didn’t, I still appreciate you. I’ve frequented these forums for about a year, and posted a handful of times.  I’m just so down and lonely and depressed. I hug and kiss my children every night.  But I need more. I have forgotten how to live without dope. It’s a sad and painful realiziation that I am no longer the man that I want my son to look up to. And now I have a daughter. I need to get my shit together quick.

I just realized I didn’t go into the legal difficulties I am experiencing (started talking about my probation and never elaborated). I’ll get into later. That’s another fucked up story.  Peace out and happy nods. Thanks for listening.",1474519087.0

CWE Basics - 

Acetaminophen slightly dissolves into cold water at a measure of something like
14000mg per liter or 14mg per ml of water....not a lot physically.

Oxy dissolves super readily into water:
100 mg/ml

At a guess I use 50-100mg of water for a 7-10 percocet filtration....let's go high...

So 100ml water that I'm throwing 3250mg of APAP into (325x10) and 100mg of oxy into.

By the paper, 1ml of water is all I need to dissolve/absorb all of the oxy but we got a shitload of APAP, talc/corn starch whateverthefuckelse is in a percocet to deal with.

So at only 14mg per ml,  and using 100ml of water, only around 140mg of APAP *should* be in the final mixture after filtering.

BUT

....because we inherently distrust ourselves with shit like *not poisoning our livers* and are restless, disharmonious addicts, we're bound to fuck up somehow and end up with more than 140 in our final product so that being said, we want to remove even more APAP.

Chilling the water, even a little, makes water an even more inhospitable place for acetaminophen so right after I wet the filter, but before I pour the mix into said filter, I add a few ice chips to the pre-filtered solution and stir....the temp drops fast and the ice disappears within 15 seconds....THEN I pour it through the filter.


This wasn't supposed to be a how-to but outlining how I do it helps my next question somewhat.

Some people *warm* the water/apap solution to dissolve more apap into it and then flash chill/freeze in the freezer to cause the APAP to precipitate out....

WHY would you try to dissolve more apap into the water?!? Yeah, you're going to drop the temp later but why not just use cold fucking water to begin with?

Sorry for the long post but might I refer you to the reason:

So I prepped a shot, found a vein on my wrist (you can sorta see the red dot), tied off, registered, bla bla bla. There wasn't much pain during injection other than the usual pokey pain of hitting a sensitive area.

I definitely felt the rush so I don't think I missed but a couple minutes afterwards my hand started swelling up like from a histamine reaction. And the swelling grew bigger and bigger. Now it's slightly difficult to move the wrist because of the swelling. 

Did I sort of hit an artery? I know they're all close there but I'd think I feel it immediately, no? I've never hit an artery before but I've seen people hit them and that's sort what I'm worried about.

Could it be because I let go off the tourniquet only after I pushed the plunger? I really don't know how to keep it registered and untie (wish I had three hands). Whenever I can I don't use the tourniquet.

It seems like a regular histamine reaction which I've had before (been doing IV for about four years) but never this strong. So I didn't go to the hospital.

It's been about 15 minutes now and the swelling is still there but it hasn't gotten worse. So my plan is to alcohol swab it and chill and if it gets like way worse go to ER but otherwise to do nothing.

What do y'all think? I can get more pics.

On very very few occations I have had success at a Walmart and or a Kroger.    But it is always short lived.... They might sell me some once or twice then demand a insulin bottle or a script 

It blows my mind that phramacist takes the ""oath of a pharmacist"" which is just like the hipo oath a doctor takes.... But doesn't support harm reduction.  They will lie and say it is illegal to sell them .. But really it is up to the pharmacist if they sell them or  not.  And around here it's a ""fuck you junkie""

This may help!","I used to be prescribed 14x 50 mcg patches, 30mg of methadone a day, and 10mg of oxy daily. 

14x patches cause my docs do 28 day refills so your script never falls on a weekend. Obviously I was supposed to be changing them every 48 hours instead of every 72. Complained that with a very physical job, in the heat, and sweating, my patches never lasted  72 hours (which was true). Later I just started cutting them in  half (so 25mcg) and using them in my mouth. Usually the upper lip. In the VERY  beginning i could use that 25 mcg patch at night, and be fine through the night and until 2-3pm the next day. One half, administered in the car to the airport, got me through a 12hr flight to Ireland very happily. Usually flights kill me and I spent most of it literally holding myself out of the seat by my triceps. Not that time. BUT, within a few months I went from redosing 12hrs+ to every 8, and then every 4hrs. As others are saying, it has NO legs very, very quickly. People aren't wrong about it destroying tolerance fast, but in my experience, tolerance also drops fairly quickly. I'd blow  through those 14 patches in a 4-5 days and then be back to the methadone and perc. The first few days felt like you JUST barely are keeping out of withdrawal. After that though, the 30mg of 'done would keep me happy. I'd usually have use the the Percocet, in 50mg increments for 3-4 days before I could get another script, but in my experience, the methadone destroyed my tolerance FAR worse the Fentanyl. I was only prescribed the Fent when I wasn't getting enough relief from the methadone. The VA, in all their wisdom, thought somebody on 6 percocet a day and not getting relief throughout the day, should maintain that script and be prescribed methadone instead for round the clock relief. In hindsight I should be pissed that they didn't try 100 long half-life meds BEFORE every trying methadone. But I was young and dumb and didn't know any better. Fucking herp derp....

I did that cycle for almost a decade until I discovered Lyrica. I'm on the largest possible dose of Lyrica a day (600mg) a day and I absolutely abuse it (initially taking 10x that dosage daily and then running out in 5 days. That being said, even after those dosages, Lyrica, even though it was being abused, would not only keep me well, but happy and productive. I'm still prescribed opiates for breakthrough pain but only 30x 5mg IR oxy a month. The Lyrica does a fairly good job controlling my pain round the clock so I generally have those 30x oxy to abuse every month. So I have one good weekend abusing, then rely on the Lyrica the rest of the month. I rarely abuse the Lyrica anymore (sometimes taking 900-1,200mg a day) but for the most part, I stick to the 600mg a day. Don't get me wrong, I had a couple of rough (but not full blown withdrawals rough) months while using the Lyrica to get well. BUT, it could have been much, much worse. During that period I was also taking 1-4mg daily of Xanax, but I was very careful to limit it to 2-3 days a week. Basically only when I was taking the Lyrica as prescribed and needed a little bit more help.

So, after a couple months of that, I now have fun with my 30 oxy a month, use the Lyrica as prescribed, and maybe 1-2 or twice a week take .5mg-1mg of xanax just at night to help sleep. I realize that, due to the methadone, I'll probably be PAWS for a year+ but that's ok. The Lyrica (as prescribed) and occasional xanax will get me through it ok. 

So here's the deal with Lyrica. It's pregabalin, which is gabapentins big brother. Lyrica is heroin to gabapentins oxy. I've seen plenty of people of say that neither gaba or pregaba helped them in withdrawals. I don't want to tell people to abuse it, and one should start with the prescribed dose (be warned...it takes a very long time to kick in....long as in 1.5-2hrs) and work up. At first I had to take 5x more than they were prescribing to get any relief. But, on the other hand, I had a massive tolerance at fist and was started on gabapentin, not Lyrica. Within three months I was switched from gaba to pregaba. Tolerance builds very, very fast when abusing. In my experience though, at least with pregaba, if you're not abusing and feeling ok, a dose should sustain you for awhile. I've been chipping the oxy for a few days a month but mainly sustaining the Lyrica, at max dosage, and doing ok for 3 months now. With the occasional emergency xanax.

Lyrica saved my life and my relationships. Additionally, for you folks in legitimate pain, due to neurological injuries sustained during multiple tours in Iraq, Afghan, and N. Africa, the Lyrica has been a phenomenal pain killer for me as well. Be warned though, for muscular or skeletal pain it won't do much, if anything. But, for my fellow junkies, it can be the best crutch you'll ever find. Only experimented with Kratom a few times, and it did offer some relief, but not on the level with Lyrica. Same thing with lope, and i experimented with up to 60mg. Aside from preventing, me having to set up shop in my bathroom, lope was worthless for me.

Again, not advocating you go out and massively abuse these drugs, but I did, and it got me off of a massive, decade long habit. I know this is 'cliche, but every day does get minutely better.

Sometimes you know you'll have money in days time but that isn't soon enough.


This is a method to get cash that will work for nearly everyone in my experience. This is not ""free"" money and you will be putting yourself in debt and have to pay it back just as you would if you overdrafted an account.

Just go to any big store like target or Walmart and grab 200-300$ worth of random returnable shit (avoid electronics). At the register apply for a store credit card. Typically when you apply for one you will be approved on the spot and that purchase will go into your newly approved card. You are issued temporary card (a receipt wih your card number) to use while you wait for real plastic to come in mail but that doesn't matter.

Take your items you bought with your store card you just got approved for with the receipt from the purchase straight to the return counter. Normally returns are only given back in the tender in which you paid. If you paid with cash you get cash back, pay with credit and it can only go back onto your card.

However you always have the option to get instore credit aka merchandise card aka gift card. Gift cards are as good as cash to a junkie.

You should be able to take it from here but some suggestions include coinstar giftcard selling kiosks (google them), selling the card to pawn shops. Both of these will obvioisly result in less cash than the card value. If you're a shameless junkie you can always stalk the register lines and parking lot and offer to pay for people's items for cash, possibly at a small discount to make it worth their while.

Knowing this community I will definitely get some posts saying this is obvious or everyone knows this trick but I can guarantee you there are a ton of people that don't. No one I've shared this method with has known every piece. Most know how to get gift cards via shoplifting and no receipt return scams, less know they can cash out a credit card by purchasing shit with it and then returning for store credit, and less have thought to combine that with instant approval store credit cards.

I hope most of you learned at least something and that the knowledge comes in handy. To those pissed I'm publicly posting this method online.... to you I say: AYYYYYY

Edit: for those who play with cards and are interested in in-store, the CC to store credit trick is great for cashing out dumps. Best at big box home improvement stores like lows or Home Depot because those are the easiest and fastest merchandise cards to sell anonymously on Craigslist (obviously you don't wanna provide an ID to a pawnshop to sell store credit that obtained from an original transaction that was frauded). Contractors and construction companies buy these cards at 80% value of higher all day. Biggest cost for them next to labor is materials, and if they can save 20% on materials buy buying store credit from people like you that's more money in their pocket. They also have the means to buy 1000s at a time if you have a heavy hitting dump or are cashing one several at once. You will have anonymously turned a dump into cold hard cash in hand long before anyone gets a chance to reverse any of your damage ",1474600210.0

It makes sense having 2 days of moderate flu-like withdrawals after 4 weeks dosing 60-150mg per day,  the ratio of shitty days to good days pays off, but if a single day or weekend produces WDs, then the ratio is 1:1 and basically not worth it.

I'm a longtime lurker on this sub. Just to give some background, me and my friend are college students in our early 20s. We've been best friends for over 10 years, and in the past 3 years we've started experimenting with drugs. At first, we both got into smoking weed, but it took less than a year for us to move on to stronger psychedelics like shrooms and acid. Shortly thereafter, we started trying benzos and opiates/opioids.

Benzos didn't seem to do much for me, but opiates soon became my DOC. After a brief run with snorting heroin, I decided to control my habit. I would only do opiates once a month at the most. They would only be in the form of pills so the chances of me getting anything with fent would be reduced drastically. So far it's been a year and I've stuck to my plan.

My friend, who I'll call X from now on, only recently got into dope through another friend of ours who I'll call Y. X has been on it every time I've seen him for the past 3 weeks, although he doesn't know that I know. I've heard from his roommates that he's been hanging out with Y all the time, and they always leave their apartment for some undisclosed reason as soon as Y gets a text from who I assume to be his Dboy. X's roommates always notice him slipping away to the bathroom from where they can hear him snorting something. His pupils are perpetually pinned and he's been getting pissed off at small things that he never would have even noticed before.

Yesterday, I learned that all of my suspicions have been confirmed and that he's admitted his habit to one or two of his roommates. This isn't just a problem for his health. He has a pending felony drug charge for which he has to get drug tested to get it brought down to a misdemeanor. His last drug test will be a hair test, and they will find out that he's been doing opiates with absolute certainty. He hasn't been going to any of his classes because he's been content to spend all of his time watching Netflix, snorting dope, or playing Steam games on his laptop.

I'm concerned about him, but I have no idea how to confront him about this. His roommates are going to talk to him about it first, and some time after that so will I. I don't want to try to come at him offensively, because I know how I would feel if someone did that to me at the height of my addiction. What should I do guys? This dude has been my best friend for years, and I don't want to see him continue fucking his life up.",1474580507.0

Minus a few rant,"Soo i got laid off back in Feb and was using mostly subs as I couldn't afford my 10-15 a day roxy habit (i pay 15-20 ea).  Id chip here and there with blues, sometimes going on a 1-2 week run and even when i was on subs id still be miserable a lot of ot being stressed about bills and work.  I have been w/ my girl 5 years and she knew about the pills just not to the extent.  She hates all drugs (she tolerates weed, will smoke rarely).  I of course denied any use unless caught dead to rights and even still only give up what i really have to, half truths and whatnot.  
  
It got to the point she ended up leaving me bc i was miserable and within a few days went to my buddies dad whom i grew up with to ask for help getting a job.  Hes one of the guys who runs the show with our union.  He had two sons go thru the same thing so when he asked if i was clean i was honest for the first time and told him no.  He knew anyway..  Promised me a job if i went to the farm (what we call rehab).  In my line of work its not uncommon to have to go..
  In any case, i go do the full 30 and everything i lost came back pretty quick.  Ive never had to steal for my habit but pretty much live in a house of cards, where im behind on bills and just scraping by.  So i get out stay clean for 3 weeks and now having money in my pocket am dying to test my tolerance thinking i can chip and now that i know about WDs i wont get sucked in this time. Pfft i was getting super high off 3 blues throughout the day.  Long story short noone knows ive relapsed but have been on a run the last 3 months.  Work for my local has been super slow but without cashing in that favor from my friends dad i was offered a job.  3 weeks into it we all get laid off bc the engineers messed up their numbers.  
  So it brings me to now, where im out of work the last month and a half noone knows ive relapsed and im taking subs to get by but still getting roxies even though i dont have the money to do it.  Im getting further behind on my bills and trying to secure another job.  I was counting on a large check from a family member bc my sister and cousin got theirs early for stuff w their house and come to find out now that i wont be getting it until thanksgiving/xmas.  Ive never counted on money from anyone else but i feel like the rug got pulled out from under me having rationalized getting high saying i can fix everything when i get the check.  I feel super lonely because everyone was so happy i looked healthy and thinks im clean but im not and i feel like if i was honest im going to be a huge disappointment.  Ugh.
  So theres more to everything im just not as motivated to keep typing.  I remember getting clean in rehab sucking but not being impossible and also figured itd be easy now that i know it's possible to get clean, but it aint easy one bit lol.
I guess the point of this was all to vent a bit and just to say if you have any clean time together dont let your ego take over like mine did.  I remember speakers in rehab saying you cant ever use at all but especially your DOC again.  Not even one more time and i scoffed at that idea.  Maybe some people can but if there is one thing I learned its either all or nothing for me when using.  There is no chipping no middle ground.  Its either 200-300 a day or 0.  Hang in there everyone.

I advertise my services on CL and Grindr as a ""message specialist w/ full release"" and have been getting a fair amount of business. Well, I've got this one client that's really rich, and he said he was gonna refer me to his friend who is going through a REALLY stressful time right now. He has to try to function at a really high level everyday, doing these big talks and everything, so I'm like, ""Sure dude, hook me up!""

Well, this guy calls me up and on the phone he's like, ""Look, The_Dawkness, I can tell you, I have the best body. I have an amazing body, it's the best. It's so good you'll get tired of massaging it and go right to jerking me off."" I've heard this kind of talk out of dudes before, and usually they're full of shit, then he goes on to say some other shit. ""My dick, I can tell you, it's the biggest. It's HUGE. People all over the world call me to tell me how great, and big, my dick is. It's fabulous.""

So, I agree to the meetup, and a black Suburban pulls up in front of my place and these guys in suits and avaitors get out and put me in the back seat. They say I've got to wear a blindfold, ""this guy is really secretive"", and I agree.

We get to the place and they whisk me away to an elevator that feels like it takes forever to get wherever the fuck it's going and I'm just sitting there the whole time thinking about the fat fucking shot I'm gonna do when this is all over and I've successfully jerked this dude off and got my 350 bucks, and the elevator finally stops.

The turkeys in the suits take the blindfold off and I see this room with like, fucking gold trim everywhere. I feel like I'm in some Arab oil baron's penthouse suite, everything looks opulent and tacky, cringe-worthy even. Gaudy.

They lead me towards this room off the side of the ""foyer"" or whatever the fuck you'd call it, walking the whole way on an oriental rug that probably cost half a million dollars. 

I walk in and see this fucking orange blob with a towel around the midsection of it, and the chodes in the suits leave me there with this Tangerine Jabba the Hutt.

I walk in and there are TV screens on the ceiling and floor and they're playing sexually suggestive videos of a girl who he ended up saying was his daughter, which really freaked me out.

Well, I get down to business, because I'm not losing this $350 and when we get to the ""full release"" portion, the dude's got like, a little flaccid orange circus peanut that I can only really grab with my index finger and thumb and it takes like 5 seconds while he's yelling out some weird Eastern European type name and screaming the ""N word"" a lot which bothered me even more.

After I finished I left with no tip, but I got high at least.

That guy was a fucking weirdo. I hope he crashes and burns. But I have an appointment with him next week.

If you only use a short acting opioid like U4 once per week (6x 10mg doses through the day), or once per month (two days @ 60mg each), would my brain downregulate the opioids receptors and produce WDs? Or would I just experience an afterglow?
It makes sense having 2 days of moderate flu-like withdrawals after 4 weeks dosing 60-150mg per day, the ratio of shitty days to good days pays off, but if a single day or weekend produces WDs, then the ratio is 1:1 and basically not worth it.

Maybe,"I know that sounds ridiculous but it will probably make sense when I explain my situation. Ok so my background, I used to use a lot of various drugs with the exception being opiates. I sort of developed a cross tolerance to everything it seemed and nothing really seemed to get me high anymore (or at least not as high as I wanted to be). 

Anyways, ive been completely sober since february due to probation so my tolerance for everything is pretty much non existent. 2 days ago I got a script for 20 Tylenol 3#s from my doctor and went home. I called my brother who used to do a lot of opiates and I asked how much I should take. He said just 3 maybe 4. So I ended up taking 5 because I thought if anything it was just gonna get me a little high.

So at 5 pm I ate 1500mg apap and 150mg codeine. Im 18 years old, male, and only weigh 116 pounds.
At 5:40 I started feeling it so I went in my backyard and vaped some high quality cbd oil and smoked a cigarette. I started feeling pretty good, but also a little light headed. After the cigarette I decided to go get some ice cream. I go inside and start scooping some icecream. I notice that I keep feeling more and more light headed and it got so bad that I leaned over on my counter and just layed there. I thought to myself ""ok just hurry up and make it upstairs and you can lie down in your bed when you get up there"" so I grab my icecream and vape and try to leave the kitchen. As im doing that my dad is coming into the kitchen and he said ""is that dinner?"" I was using 100% of my willpower to make it upstairs before I died and all I could say was ""no, just ice cream"" then I started leaning against the wall and making this weird low grunting sound like ""unnngggggg"" the last thing I remember is my dad saying ""what the hell?""

Next thing I know I'm lying on my back in the kitchen and my dad is on the floor next to me. He keeps saying ""anon?! Are you ok?! What's wrong?!"" I could barely open my eyes and talking seemed impossible so I just layed there for like 2 minutes looking into my dad's sad, worried face. Eventually I said ""I...think I'm just sick. Please help me into your room."" He helped me get up and walk into his room and I layed down on his bed. he has his own blood pressure machine so he took my blood pressure and it was only 71 over 32. I was so high and lightheaded I couldn't really do anything so I just layed there for like 3 hours. I asked my dad what happened and he said that I fell on the ground and my face was completely pale and I was barely breathing. 

Yesterday I took the same dose that I took on Friday and felt fine. But when I smoked a cigarette I started feeling the same lightheaded feeling so maybe theres a corolation there.

Here's what happened.   I had been on Suboxone for about 2 yrs. Using it sublingual.  Then one day a few weeks ago I tried it iv.  I had 3 tiny little cut strips off an 8 my strip.  It probably amounted to 2 mgs altogether.  Nothing was felt really but I had a slight nod off and on that lasted a few hours.  Then today, oh my effing god, I scared myself.  Was going down a dirt road and iv'd 4mg in about 1/2 cc of water.   Let's say I used 1/2 full tuberculin syringe of water.  I dissolved the strip in water in spoon, mixed up with back of plunger till it was all just milky orange liquid and then sucked up liquid using no cotton.  I know, stupid right, I had no filter and was in a hurry someone might come through.  I shot it in my elbow and then wtf!!!  It hit hard and kept hitting for like 2 minutes.  It scared me it was so intense.  It was like a heroin rush only a cold rush.  My thighs, crotch and ass were cold and there was a slight ringing in ears.  It almost reminded me of a too big hit of crack where you kinda look around and freak out alittle bit.  Because I had never felt it before or read others similar experiences I got scared and kept exhaling and telling myself to keep it together and hope to god it starts getting less intense.  I was worried I was so high that people might see in the store I was heading to.  Its really hard to explain the feeling but now that I know what to expect and I'm not driving and paranoid about getting caught, I am going to try it again, this time with around 3 mg and with a cotton filter.  Will let you know how it goes.",1474796863.0

But the reason I'm asking is regarding methadone

-

I know some people religiously sell the 1 take home they get, every single week, and get away with it - despite being given GC/ms, and inevidabky I'm sure they've gotten tests the day after (Monday) - yet as we all know people do this every week and dont get kicked out

-

But here is MY situation. I'm at 110 MG's and get a months worth of take homes. I'm wondering, if I get bumped up to 120mg's - and just save the other 10 MG's for an emergency surplus... Could I run into any problems?

-

It seems that with methadone this would be more of a problem then other opiods due to how it builds up and accumulates much more in your system then other opiods due to its long half life.... And my clinic already has a number of years of test records on me for what my levels are at 110mg's

-

I am sure id be safe doing this if I only saved 5mg each day since I'd be taking a little more at least, but I really don't want to do that.

-

I know that detected levels can bounce around based on a number of factors including how much water you have drank, cardio exercise causing faster excretion etc... But I don't know if my idea is safe or not

-

Thanks!

-

P.s. - worth noting - I have heard of someone else who self-tapered down on methadone.. And they very slowly got from 100mg down to 50. When they got to 50 is when their clinic finally said something that they obviously weren't taking what they were given and they for kicked out

-

But the fact that it took all the way until they were only taking half of their dose, for an extended period of many, many months - gives me hope that my idea would work.",1474792199.0

I've used this guy before and only the last 2 pickups have caused this side effect. So, I know that it's something new that he has been using. And before someone says it.....I know that it's not fent. Even if I take a small bump....I'm sleeping in 2 hours.

I've broken a toe before and know that it's not that dangerous or can really cause damage, but very painful. What I came up with with my gf is basically:

I get high as shit on the last few bags I have left.


I get her to smash my big toe with a hammer.


I go into the hospital, they give me pain meds.


I get some kind of note saying they gave me meds for an injury.


I go in for probation, hopefully my PO buys the story. Has anyone else done something like this before? I'm dead broke, so I'm gonna be very sick if I don't come up with some money after I piss tomorrow. I'm gonna have my gf go out and turn a trick on backpage and I guess we'll split the money tomorrow. Needless to say I'm not feeling very good about myself.

Longtime lurker and non-user, here.  I am creating an infographic about fentanyl for a class I'm taking, so I'm hoping to get some perspectives from opiate users (either from ya'll who use fent or those of you who try to avoid it). From what I've read on here, some people are really worried about counterfeit pills because of it and others smoke fent patches (I think? Idk all the slang). 

Anyway, I'm looking at CDC data on the rise of fentanyl alongside the rise of drug OD deaths (they don't specify opiates) and I'm creating a map based on them to show where fent + ODs are happening. The goal is to provide awareness to non-users, as well as fight some stigma by adding your voices into it -- no matter what your voices are saying. 

I hope I get at least a few responses here! You can share as much or as little as you'd like. Are you afraid that you'll get something with fent? Have you been using it for awhile and not see what the big deal is? 

Including the state you're in would be helpful to add to the map, but I don't need that info if you don't want to share. 

Thanks to anyone who decides to share (if anyone does!).

**Non fiction 100%**

Do any of you read Nosleep? ive noticed its more like /r/writing or something about SomOne who is really just An auauthor, trying to make a suspenseful story or whatever. Just writing stories for entertainment. 

This is true. Real true. 

Im not telling you this as a cautionary tale, Im just telling you about how my life was saved in summer of 2011 by some girl who wanted to have sex with me. 
The girl that wanted to have sex with me? It my roommates girlfriend at the time. Yeah, I know. 



**Just let me tell you this story**



Allow me to set the scene for you a bit, I was (**am** still *technically*) married to this danish girl and I lived in Denmark with her for a couple years. i actually met her when i was in Vietnam while i was backpacking in SE asia..but how i met her is a story all in its own. I was 23-25 when I was with her. Looking back on it at 29 now, *fuck* I had it good. We had a bad ass 2 br apartment near Copenhagen city center. Her family was very well to do and moderately wealthy. They owned a vacation house in Sweden that we used to go for Christmas and during the summer to chill. Her sister lived in London and we visited London a few times while I was with her. She wasnt a drug addict, Complete psycho, or abusive. She was and still is beautiful. Thats why I married her when I was twenty-fucking-three, because she was the hottest thing I had laid eyes on and I had to make her mine. You wanna beautiful woman to start a family with and have a stable straight edge life? Well this was the PERFECT girl. 



I was too young. I was still tryin to get buckwild son. Little known fact- the heroin and cocaine scene in Denmark is absolutely fucking *phenomenal*. This was 4 years ago and I *still* have dreams sometimes where Im back in Denmark scoring smack and coke because being a junkie there was like paradise, and I was living in Seattle before Denmark. I thought the Seattle heroin scene was cool. There was a 24 hr open air market but after being there a year i discovered a heroin ""house"". It wasnt like one of clinics that you hear about in Scandinavia where they give you free dope, this was like an office with an intercom where they buzzed you in and you could buy and inject heroin there safely and chill and smoke cigarettes and weed on their couches. Any other drugs would get you kicked the Fuck out. If they caught you smoking crack in there or something, youre gone. And they may or may not let you back in the next time. You weren't allowed to use heroin that you didnt buy there either. The heroin they sold was white. If you didnt taste it first, youd think it was coke. Brown heroin is what they sold at the open air place I told you about. Anyway. This heroin house was like a pseudo-government-aggreement as far as I could tell. They gave you all clean works you needed to bang w and a bathroom w no lock so they could easily find you. Like I said tho, any other drugs would get you kicked out. Except weed. Little known fact about Denmark #2 -weed in Denmark is on point. Yes, ive been to Amsterdam and I admit, Amsterdam is a more beautiful city... Canals and shit. But christiania in Copenhagen is a wayyyyyy cooler atmosphere to smoke and chill than in Amsterdam. Plus, when I was in Amsterdam, its such a smokey tourist hot spot that they over charge for bullshit. Copenhagen hash, bud, heroin, coke... Im not kidding when I say best place ive been. Shit is on. Fucking. Point. 



**Guys, I'm leading to the actual story of getting my life saved but I'm on stims so we're just taking the long way k? **



Anyway. So instead of keeping my shit together in junkie paradise with a FUCKING downright gorgeous Scandinavian woman who I was married to, who I had permanent residency visa living with, I decided to leave. We got into a stupid ass fucking fight about I can't remember what. Wed been fighting for a while and I was unhappy and *rrrrrrrrrrreal* strung out on smack and coke and I just told her I was leaving. Like that. We were/are fuckin married and I just bounced. Because im a piece of shit junkie. She could be a raging bitch tho. Anda shit talker bc her fam was rich. Im not saying she was an angel. 



So I left Denmark over a stupid fight because life w her was just boring. I loved her but I was young and wasnt done yet. One of my best friends AMC, had moved to NYC from Seattle and had been asking, practically *begging* me to come to NYC and get a job and live there and shit. I could crash at his house in Brooklyn for free. Remember how I said that the last city I lived in before Copenhagen was Seattle? Well AMC was literally the first person i met outside of school in when I moved to Seattle, we clicked instantly. You know how there's just some people in life you meet and just *right away* youre totally cool with? Like you've been friends with forever already? Like no mAtter what you say or do they would never judge you? This was me and AMC. There's been *at least* 3 separate occasions where I showed up at AMCs house with *nothing* but the clothes on my back and my big green back pack. All strung out on dope with out a damn thing in the world and he always took me in. He was also the person that introduced me to shooting smack.

 

I met him when I was 19 and I was a kid from a small city that had moved to a big city. like I said, me and AMC instantly clicked. just some people you meet in life you immediately become best boys with almost over night. anyway, after work AMC invited me over to his apartment to chill. I didn't have shit else going on and I was trying to make new friends in a new city so why not? So I get there, and him and his buddies had some little green pills, you know what I'm talking about. they were chasing them on foil and then I watched him and his (our) other homie bang them. I had never seen anyone bang anything in my entire life. I'm originally from the Midwest, but I didn't grow up on a farm or some shit. Heroin was pretty much the only drug id never tried before I moved to seattle besides like PCP and shit like that. but seeinig somebody bang for the first time and watching their eyes roll into the back of their head as they leaned forward in what looked like the greatest pleasure man could desire. Like I said, I wasn't a fresh faced farm boy when I moved there, I think that's part of the reason me and AMC clicked. when i was in highschool i had dabbled in coke, meth, psychs was moving trees in weight and just up to no good when it came to everything.....except heroin. seeing someone shoot up for the first time was like a new world just opened up to me. i mean, back in the Midwest in highschool me and some friends would twirl the pipe all weekend but id never seen someone *bang*. anyway, i didn't shoot up that exact day. but after a couple times of going over there i gave in. i had to know what it was like. AMC was the first person that ever gave me a shot. AMC was the person that taught me how to shoot dope. AMC was the person that taught me how to cold cop in seattle wayyyyyyy back in the day, a fuckin decade ago 'youngins' (sorry). The first time i let AMC shoot me it was just morphine. But we all know how that goes. Few short weeks later we were out banging heroin together on broadway in seattle. AMC was my guide into the new world of injecting smack. You know that older junkie friend you have that's been doing heroin way longer than you that you call everytime you think you might have an abscess? or missed a shot here or there and what do i do? or is it safe to do smack and so and so? that guy? that was AMC to me. he was actually a couple months younger than me but he had a lot more exp shooting smack than i did. he showed me the ropes. and I'm not mad at him for it. i don't feel like he pressured me. i *wanted* to see what it was like and he showed me. and on top of that, AMC was one of the most genuine, heartfelt, generous, thoughtful, insanely funny people ive ever met and just a brother to me really. not just a ""drug buddy"". sometimes we would get mad at eachother over stupid drug shit but it was always temporary. he and i both knew that in a pinch, if one needed the other, we had eachothers back. AMC was my fucking boy. He is one of the best people i have ever known. 
 

I still remember some of the hard laughs we shared. the kind of laugh where you feel like youre going to have a 6 pack the next day because youre laughing so hard it makes your stomach muscles burn.



ok... sorry for the novel but heres where I'm going to tie it together. There is some kind of irony here but its hard to express. I also feel like theres a life lesson here but its obvious what that is and i already told you that this isn't some cautionary ""don't do drugs"" tale. This is how being a junky piece of shit saved my life.



So from Denmark i moved to Brooklyn to live w AMC and his roommates. there were 5 us of including me. One couple, one single girl, AMC, and myself. AMC had his own room but he was almost never home, he had a girl he was seeing in LES that he usually stayed with and i would just sleep in his bed. on the nights he was home i would just sleep on the couch in the living room. Well, being the great guy i am, and the good friend i am, and the respectful guest i am in someones home in fucking NYC ,while not paying a fucking CENT of rent for months...(anyone that's lived in NYC can tell you i had the homie-hookup). and guess what? i felt so comfortable and so at home that i started banging the roommates gf. NOT AMCs girl. fucking never EVER. the couple i told you about. the girl was a cute blonde girl that lived w her boyfriend in the apartment and at night when i would be sleeping on the couch she would sit and watch movies with me...the we started fucking. and it was good. really fucking good. but it was fucking bad. fuck, i shouldn't have done that. and her bf, my roommate, was a *fucking* cool guy. I'm just a piece of shit ok? ok. moving along.


So lets recap what a piece of shit i already am (just from what you now *know*). I just left a beautiful wife in Denmark with whom my life was pretty much perfect, who wanted to have kids w me, even caught me shooting smack and still tried to work it out w me. Gave her 10 day notice after our fight and flew to NYC. yea, we got into a fight about dishes or some shit (honestly cant remember, but it was *dumb*) and i basically said ""fuck this I'm out in 10 days"". in my opi rage and drug addled brain i just bought the ticket right when the fight started. i was already all strung out and i was chilling at the heroin house/office place when she texted me, which is one of the only places i felt at peace in Copenhagen after a while (btw, it was a *less* than 5 min walk from our apt. if i lit a smoke when i walked out the door, id be at the office/house before my smoke was done....junkie *paradise*)... One of my closest friends i have ever met has given me the extreme courtesy of letting me stay at his place FOR FREE, and somehow i cant abstain from fucking the one girl in the house who *isn't single*. when i left my wife there was no decision time or guilt period. i was in NYC banging smack and coke and kicking old school with one of my best boys i will ever know. slangin dick. mean while my poor wife still thinks I'm just ""having a phase"" or some shit and actually thinks I'm coming back to Denmark (spoiler= i never did). i never told her i was coming back. this was just her way of thinking. why would i leave such a perfect life w her? I'm a fucking loser piece of shit. that's why. 


so anyway, me and roommates girl friend were hooking up pretty regular after a while. boyfriend worked at a bar and didn't get home until like 5am so we would just fuck whenever we could. some nights when AMC wasn't home she would come into his room because she knew id be sleeping in there and she'd wake me up to fuck. other nights if i had fallen asleep on the couch and her bf wasn't home yet, she would come wake me up on the couch and we'd fuck. well, the night of the incident, this girls little sister happened to be visiting her from CT and the three of us went out drinking bc her bf was at work. id done a few bags, half a bun maybe, earlier in the day but at night i was just out drinking w them. we all went home pretty early. little sister passed out. i thought rooommates gf had passed out, so i didn't plan on getting any booty and i had two bars, school busses, that i took just to pass the fuck out.


I woke up in the hospital. I'm pretty sure it was in Brooklyn but i was fucking out of it and couldn't tell you. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life (ive had 2 more ODs since then but the first one is a real shocker), I never thought it would happen to me.. anyway, the roommates girlfriend i was banging? she woke up in the night before bf got off work and wanted some D. she went to the couch...didn't see me. went to AMCs bed...didn't see me. she notices that the bathroom light is on in the hall. she knocks...no answer. shes starting to get worried and thinks i just got drunk and passed out on the bathroom floor. she manages to get the door unlocked and when she sees me...i obviously wasn't conscious to hear it but it, no shit, her scream woke the whole building they said. From what I'm told, i was on the bathroom floor w my pants down like i was trying to take a piss and fell over. Blue face, Blue hands. Medics get called. Meanwhile AMC gets home just before dawn and realizes whats happening. I was told he was bawling like a baby on the stoop as the medics were trying to bring me back. i cant imagine what he was thinking, after all, he was the one that taught me how to do the shit, got me started, taught me how to cold cop, was basically my ""everything you need to know about shooting smack friend"" but more than anything he was a really, really, and i mean *really* fucking close friend to me...after enough narcan they put me in an ambulance and AMC, my boy, rode with me to the hospital and held my hand the whole way. I wasn't conscious at any point during the amberlamp ride. this is just what he told me. he held my hand as i pissed myself in the ambulance and went full exorcist in WD after all that narcan but still too much benzo in my system to ""wake up"". he stayed by my side at the hostpital until he had to go to work the next afternoon. when i got released from the hospital late the next afternoon (i was *out* for like 12 hours) i took a cab to AMCs work in LES, he paid my cab fair, gave me some fllip flops and a t shirt,( I ODd in my night clothes. it was summer in NYC, i was only wearing a pissed in swimsuit.) i think i ODd around 3am, it was dawn before i was in the ambulance.

 If that fucking girl didn't decide to get out of bed and get properly fucked, If she woulda just fell asleep, i wouldn't be here. No one would have fould me until AMC woulda got home. but even then, chances are he woulda been drunk and high as fuck and walked right past the bathroom (with me dying in it) and just passed out. Me being a piece of shit human being and banging this girl saved my life yall. I have no idea where the moral in all this story is in the story but there has to be one in there. 

And AMC? Even though hes the one that taught me to shoot heroin and cold cop and do the stuff that the people on this sub know how to do that your average civilian doesn't or wouldn't or couldn't because theyre too scared? he taught me that. he was my introduction to needles and heroin. And i don't hold it against him. i love him. i always will, I'm just glad i got to know the dude. He died of a heroin over dose about 2 years ago... Best worst friend ever. I love him. i still have dreams about him. even though we were junkies together he wasn't a junkie to me. he was a best friend. he was a (good) human being with family and emotions and a girl that loved him. as far as i know, he never jacked anyone or stole shit for his habit, that's more than i can say for 99% of junkies ive met. his first name is Andrew, if youre from seattle and your about 30 years old, theres a good chance you know who he is...was...

i know my grammar isn't proper and all that shit. but i cant be bothered to fix it right now. i just did a bunch of amps and really felt like typing this story out in full because i don't think i ever have. i know theres some kid of lesson in here for everyone but i cant figure it out, or figure out the right way to say it. it was therapeutic writing this. thanks to anyone that actually read the whole thing. if yall have any questions about shooting smack in Denmark or South east asia or..anything let me know. i didn't just make all this shit up. 


TL;DR reason i got saved from dying of OD was because my roommates gf (who i was banging) woke up and wanted to fuck so she came looking for me and found me in the bathroom. blue face. blue hands. no Bueno. 

TLDR:TLDR I'm a fucking piece of shit. carry on 




edit: no ones really asked me about this yet, but the dope scene in DK is where the fuck its at. Open air market that sells coke and dope that also has free rigs and works inside. Heroin ""offices/houses"" where you could buy dope and use it and chill as long as they were open 9-6 (just like a regular business). ive done dope on 5 continents and more countries than i can remember, but DK was the *best*. 4 years later and i *still* have dreams about copping in Copenhagen. Not only for the heroin and coke, but hash was sold openly at pretty much every park. and if you didn't want hash you could go to Christiania and buy all the weed you wanted...just like Amsterdam...but better (in my humble opinion)

54czaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/54czaj/a_very_scary_situation_a_lesson_learned_and_word/,12,https://redd.it/54czaj,Tool-gasm,"A very scary situation, a lesson learned and word the wise!","Hello friends, I wanted to share a quick story that happened to me recently.

Where I live tar is the only thing available. Usually I will turn it into powder and snort it, other times I will smoke it instead. On extremely rare occasions when I come across a friend with clean rigs, probably about 3 times a year, I will bang it.

A little over a month ago I was diagnosed with a skin infection called Cellulitis, a fairly common yet potentially fatal bacterial staph infection. It formed on the back of my neck, and after a week of antibiotics it went away. 

About 3 weeks later, I was hanging with a friend who has Crohn's disease which requires a monthly IM injection which she does herself. I decided I would bang a point since it had been so long. I take pride in my IV procedure and usually follow all the harm reduction steps; the operative word here is ""usually"", as I forgot to clean/sterilize the injection site this time around.

Some of you may already know where this is going. The next day I noticed what appeared to be the first stage of the Cellulitis infection. It was very mild so I didn't think too much about it. The day after that it was blatantly clear the infection had come back, only much worse and no longer isolated to my neck. Both of my feet were tremendously effected and had developed blisters on some of the toes. My neck was infected again as well, along with my scalp (all over, but thankfully not visible as I have long thick hair), my eyelids, a small spot on my arm and, most alarming, on my groin and FUCKING BALLS AND GOOCH.

To paint a picture, Cellulitis, at least in my case, was characterised by red, swollen, tingly, hot skin sometimes accompanied by strange painful blisters. My worst symptom, however, was a red line coming from the infection on my foot traveling up my ankle and onto my leg; the infection was RAPIDLY spreading and had potentially entered my blood stream. Personally, I drew the goddam line at the testicles.

The doctor was up front about how serious this looked, and would have admitted me to the ER if it wasn't for the fact that I had no fever, a very good sign and the only thing going for me. He gave me a strong shot of antibiotics, along with another oral regiment and told me to go to the ER immediately if it got any worse or I developed a fever.

What he said next scared the shit out of me; when he asked if I ever use IV drugs I knew I was in trouble. He had no reason to believe I used drugs at all, let alone by route of injection. My injection mark had almost completely healed and was never really visible to begin with (trust me, there were no signs); he straight up Gregory Housed me.

I said yes, I had 3 nights ago, and just like that my prognosis became even more bleak. Apparently, despite having cleared up the infection on my neck, the bacteria may have not been completely killed. When the needle punctured my skin it brought an unwanted guest along and as I plunged it's contents into my vein I inadvertently sent a deadly staph infection swimming through my body. 

This is what caused the infection to spread literally from head to toe. It was also stronger this time around as it had become more resistant to the antibiotics I was taking. My doctor said it was also likely the infection spread to my heart, or perhaps another internal organ. Luckily he was able to pull some strings at the hospital and got me an appointment with a cardiologist the next day. He also took a good amount of my blood and began doing cultures on them to further asess my situation.

I had an EKG done which thankfully showed no sign of bacterial vegetation. The blood cultures also brought good news, although there was indeed some complication that would have fucked me hard, potentially killing me, had it not been diagnosed and treated so quickly. That was about 2 weeks ago and last Friday was the final day of treatment. 

It was supposed to be, at least. Thursday night the infection came back for the THIRD time, only on my right foot. On many other parts of my body I could feel an imminent infection (I've gotten very used to the symptoms/progress) brewing. I went straight to the ER, pretty fucking scared and at the end of my ropes. For the first time in my 24 years alive I began to feel helpless regarding a medical issue and questioned whether or not I would actually get better, and it was all my fault. It's truly a terrifying experience and I've gained a lot of empathy towards those in similar situations.

The doctor at the ER gave me an even stronger injectable antibiotic and a different oral treatment. Although it wasn't what I wanted to hear, I was happy that, like my GP, he was straightforward about my situation. I was running out of antibiotics (there was only one option left if this proved innefective), the bacteria was becoming more and more resistant with every failed attempt and I would be in very serious trouble if this IM/oral antibiotic treatment didn't do the trick. The injection was a rediculously enormous dose of 900 mg (seemed to be about 8 oz of liquid, the nurse said he had never given or heard of someone getting a dose that high) and it literally took over two minutes to empty the syringe into my ass cheeks.

I'm relieved to say the third treatment was also the last. This was an incredibly frightening ride and could have been so easily prevented by simply sterilizing the injection site. I always knew safe IV procedure was important, however, I had never even considered it was designed to protect against a situation like this. I always assumed it was solely to prevent the actual puncture wound from becoming infected. I guess I learned the hard way!

Sorry for how long this story was, but I hope those of you who took the time to read it gain something from it. Harm reduction can seem like an inconvenience at times, but it's truly a small price to pay when you consider all the complications intravenous drug use can cause. As for me, I will be sticking to my preferred intranasal route from now on. Stay safe out there guys!!

Tl;dr - Sterilize/clean your injection sight, especially if you've been sick recently or around anyone who has. It can save your life.",1474764842.0

Does anyone have any experience with O-DSMT (O-Desmethyltramadol, primary active metabolite of tramadol, RC), particularly with combating withdrawals?

Never touched H, but I been using BF aka butyryl-fentanyl for the last ~ 6 months almost daily with one month clean time in the middle, dosage of a couple mgs a day sublingually. 
Physical withdrawals are little to none but I get real depressive and suicidal thoughts the next day which only dissappear after dosing.

So was wondering if this RC or anything similar could help me taper and at least lower my dose to some maintenance dosage. I dont wanna mess around with more fent analogs or U47700 because I will prob end up abusing them, same goes for oxy. ",1474761165.0

since then i have been clean but my old dope buddy was back so i stopp taking the methadone i had been on for 9 yrs for the most part (160mg) and we started buy toronto type dope. a mix of rock hard ecp, tar and a half of each that was almost like brown sugar.

the day he died he bought about A quarter gram. good for two to four shots, sometimes one if he wants to get blasted. i couldnt use because of my a tolerance of 160mg methadone even after 2 days of no use i shot a gram of the same dope he was nodding off of and didnt feel a thing.

i disgress, on the day he died he was with his mom at 5pm then went up to his room likely to do a shot of heroin to nod before bed because i suspect he did half ther heroin .25g when he grabbed it immediately and saved the other half for later. perhaps he had more.

at 5:07 his mom went stairs and his door to his room was open and she could see him at the computer on the chair slumped. (not sure forward or backward,) his eyes ears nose and mouth were bleeding, his stomach was distended to te point it looked like it was a balloon about to pop.

its assumed he died from a heroin overdose. he was also prescribed 2mg clonazepam. maybe he took more.

has anyone heard of these symptoms on an overdose case.

his family was muslim so they barried him within 48 hours so i assume no autopsy. drug/blood/w,e tests happeend im sure.

did the shot loosen a blood clot and it hit his brain?

did his heart/organ/organs just give out and go. 

his parents had narcan which i insist they should of tried but his dad declared he was dead so they didnt use it. he gave it to them and taught them just in case. sorry i am drunk and upset like i have been most nights since.

You see, I travel *a lot* for work and i am either out of the country or just in a far away place where ill be dry and have no access or very little access to drugs while im there. I'm a dive instructor when the season is right and usually work in bars or whatever when its not the right time of year. So at the end of every dive season I usually come back to my moms house out here in the middle of fuckin nowhere. I didn't grow up here so I don't have alot friends or connects that i can easily just pick stuff up from. When I'm out here at my moms, getting high is a fuckin *mission*.

I just got back from an 8 month trip in Australia and before I left for Australia i hid a couple nugs of weed here for myself when I got back from OZ. I know the trees weren't as fresh after 8 months, but just the feeling of knowing that when I finally made it back to the literal other side of the planet I would have some bud (old or no) to smoke on right when I showed up was so exciting. 

I just recently signed a 2 year contract to work on a yacht (not like Jay-Z kinda yacht, just a boat that customers live on and we drive em around for a week and take them diving, drop them off and pick up the next weeks customers). The place that ill be working is about as in the middle of nowhere as you can get in the pacific ocean and once I leave for that job there's a good chance I might not make it back to America for two years. 

So, I've decided I'm going to give myself a present for future. Instead of just leaving myself a little weed, ive started a little stock pile of goodies to play with that will be here waiting for me once I get back, whether its in 2 years or just 8 months. So far ive set aside 2 bars, 2 30 mg IR addys, and some weed (ill most likely smoke the weed and replace it w fresher stuff before I leave, but I am NOT touching the pills). I plan to add at least one suboxone strip (with no tolerance, those will *fuck* me *up*, esp w some xanax after not touching the shit for a couple years), maybe a roxy or two, more xanax when I get a better connect, and last but not least ...SPEEDBALL WORKS! The golden standard (to me) of the best feeling high in the world. I know what I have saved now isn't much at all but i have a couple months before I leave and I want to add to it. ALOT. 

Ive read how pills wont really expire if their kept in a cool dry place, but if I had the will and enough self control to save myself a little dope and coke to put in my ""welcome home stash"" you think it would still even be good after 2 years? Would it lose potency? 

I haven't shot smack in more than a month now (...yay..) and I kiiiiinda sorta have access to it right now (surprisingly, for my location) and i think I may actually have enough self control right now to go get a couple points and put it in my ""welcome home"" bag along w some coke and a couple rigs and just leave it as a gift for my future self. 

Im not an idiot (well, kinda but whatever) and I know after been clean for a year or two you can't just go back to the same amount you were doing before you quit. And its not like once I get to my moms I want to just immediately get strung out again. Although I love my mom and I love spending time with her, every time I make it back to her house after a long trip Im always kinda bummed. Ive just been in an exotic place scuba diving and getting tan and having sex with girls with foreign accents (I dont know why thats so sexy to me) and then I get back to my boring ass moms house, in her boring ass little redneck mountain town where I have no friends. *Ofcourse* it just makes me want to do drugs. And just the thought of having weed at the house excited me, if I can have an actual array of drugs waiting for me when I get home. Fuck that would be nice. 

If I can actually hold true and not break into my ""welcome back stash"" I will take a pic of the stash  w a time stamp or current news ppaper The day I leave and the day i get back. Even if its years before I get Back to my stash. 


TL:DR

Will heroin or coke go bad

(short vent) I'm starting to get sick of this life. Sick of feeling like an anxious, unhappy pile of shit until a few rips of disgusting unrefined black acid vapor bitch slaps my lungs and robs me of any potential bright future that may lie ahead. Even more so I hate all of the money I've poured down the drain, and the items I've sold. That's the worst in my opinion.

I've taken subs several times before after running out of black, and while they ease my withdrawals 100%, what's more impressive is that they knock off my cravings almost all the way every time, without even getting me high. I haven't tried methadone, but I'm definitely interested in it. 

I don't mind the nasty long lingering withdrawals of either of these drugs. With the replacement of these chemicals, I see a ton of benefits.. and tapered carefully I have been told by loved ones and friends the correct method to do so which is a piece of cake.

As I sit back with the empty bottle of tabs,
That's comforted me for a lonely 7 months and a half. 
Accepting all the things in life as fate,
Euphoria makes its way in and starts masking hate. 
This is the life I never meant to choose,
I've dug myself so far down, I can't see the truth. 
Just one more for the hurt doesn't constitute abuse. 
Off the pills without a plan,
Just sweat and tears and restless legs. 
Feeling like I'm on the brink of death, 
Don't relapse, kid, it starts again. 

And again and again, a vicious cycle it goes,
One trip to the pharmacy and the it resolves all those woes.

Just gonna give a short summary of my drug use, started with DHC and Codeine at 16, then tried everything from Benzos, other Opiates (H, oxy, Buprenorphine, Morphine, Fentanyl), Cocaine, Amphetamine, MDMA and some psychedelics. But apart from Opiates, I never liked something enough to take it regularly. I took Codeine/DHC from 16-18 1-3 times a week with regular 2-4 week pauses. Switches to Methadone with 18 because pharmacies wouldn't give out DHC OTC as easy as before and I didn't want to be recognized by them. 
In the last 2-3 years I took Methadone maybe 2 times a week in avarage, sometimes also 4 times, but also did pauses of 2 weeks every 2 months and 1 month a year. So still something but never as much as I used to. 
Now I start to worry about physical addiction, I have had a tolerance of 70mg for a normal high after this summer (kinda overdid it and had 2x2weeks where I consumed it every to days). 

After those excesses where I took it every two days, I was actually almost expecting some withdrawal, but when I paused 3 weeks recently there was none, after 7 days even the psychological craving wasn't really bad anymor.

Now, how long would I have to use Methadone on a daily base to get addicted? 
And how is it with consumption every 3 days - because of the long half life, there's always something in my system, how long would it take me to get physically addicted?

I broke my leg a couple years ago, and received a prescription for 5 mg OxyContin pills. While I was recovering, I took them often. However, since that time (3+ years ago) I haven't taken any opiates.

About 30 minutes ago I got the idea to try them out, just for fun. I don't have an addictive personality, and even if I did I don't have a steady supply or dealer. Anyways, I took one 5 mg pill (chewed it, in order to lose the coating). As of now, I don't feel much. I am typing just fine, no real euphoria, but my body does feel warm and fuzzy. For someone as novice as myself, how would you all recommend taking them and how much would you recommend taking? What should I expect to feel?

I have been on 2 mg of suboxone for 5 weeks, before that heroin on and off for the last few months (I keep detoxing and blowing it after a week- very depressing after years clean before these relapses, I couldn't be more disappointed in myself). I had to travel to Asia for 6 weeks in the middle of a relapse and couldn't handle the idea of withdrawing while traveling for work.

My question is, which detox/withdrawal is harder in your opinion, heroin or subs? I have never used subs for any length of time, only for a few days in rehab to help get me off of heroin. I'm wondering if when I get back switching to a shorter acting opiate would make my withdrawal easier? Again, i didn't go on subs by choice, but out of necessity. I know what to expect from heroin/oxy withdrawal but to be honest I'm scared of withdrawing off of subs.

To be completely honest, I'm not even totally sure as to what constitutes a ""shit post"". And yet I'm fairly confident that this is, in fact, quite the shit post. Having said that, I just need to get this off of my chest and I really don't have anywhere else to do so.
    I suppose I'll begin with a little background information, that makes sense, eh? Anyway, I've had a love affair with opiates for some 12 odd years at this point and I just first introduced Lady H into the mix in January of last year. During these last 12 years I completed one Intensive Out Patient Program (in, roughly, '08 or '09) and briefly sought One-On-One Counseling from a Psychologist for drug and alcohol abuse in March/April of last year.
    Having said all of that, I would like to turn the focus towards the time when life became completely unmanageable for me, approximately 5 or so months ago. While everything was falling apart and turning to shit around me, I was somehow able to drudge through life until I finally came clean to my friends and family about my losing battle with the disease of addiction on Sunday, August 28th. After researching my options for a day or two, I attended a Drug and Alcohol Assessment on Tuesday, August 30th and then checked into a Detox and Inpatient Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Facility on Thursday, September 1st (2016).
    When I entered said facility, I was using 20-30 bags a day (I've only ever snorted it, thus, thankfully never IVing) just to maintain wellness and had stolen several thousand dollars from my loving parents over the years. Luckily for me, the facility I chose to attend did a marvelous job of detoxing me through a 6 day Methadone taper, accompanied by various other comfort medications, ensuring I never got very sick throughout the process. I'm also very thankful that my days got easier, my brain came to possess more clarity, and my outlook became more positive as I marched on toward a life of recovery and sobriety. I then completed the 21 day program (plus 3 days of detox) on Saturday, September 24th with a clear head, clean body, and an extremely positive outlook. 
    Then I relapsed on Tuesday, September 27th (which was clearly fucking premeditated). Anyway, backing up a bit, I totaled my car before heading off to rehab and my friends and family have been keeping a very close eye on me. I should also add that I haven't worked at my job as a server in about a month (due to obvious reasons) and it's a two hour round trip for me every time I go to pick up. So, while I DO want to lead a clean and sober life, I really had to work to fucking relapse.
    When I decided to relapse yesterday, I had to work through quite a bit of planning and scheming and decided that if any little piece or detail fell through that I would abort the entire mission and forge ahead towards my recovery again. Now, in my defense I have been hellishly sick with a MAJO R head cold which has brought my positive outlook down considerably.
    My first obstacle to overcome was that of myself finding a way to get my hands on some cold, hard cash. Luckily, while I was in treatment, my beautiful, wonderful parents decided to pay off my maxed out credit card. In full. Thus, after doing a quick cash advance on an ATM, my first obstacle had been taken care of. Swell. 
    Now, here are where things get WAY more complicated. Since I do not currently have a vehicle, I would have to use one of my parents. However, my father's vehicle just so happened to go into the shop TODAY to get repaired from, you guessed it, damage I caused. So this means I have to use my mother's vehicle, which I am very much not allowed to use. I'm also not allowed to just leave the house and go wherever I want, whenever I want, nor for as long as I want. Basically, what this all boils down to, is that I have to essentially ""steal"" my mother's vehicle so that I can make the 2 hour round trip to go pick up in the city AFTER my parents have gone to bed.
    It's risky, but I figure that my mother will go to bed around 11:00 and my father shouldn't be too far behind, which will put me at my d-boy's place around midnight. Now, that's actually getting kinda late as my dude has kids, however I'm thinking he'll still be cool with it. Keep in mind though, that through all of this, I'm fucking pumping myself full of cold meds which have made me EXTRA antsy and on edge. Hooray.
    Okay, so, I get ahold of my d-boy and he says midnight is cool with him AND he informs that he actually JUST re-upped about 20 minutes ago, so I'm a very ""lucky"" boy. At this point everything is all set up and all I have to do is play the waiting game until my folks hit the sack. Easy enough, right? Of course fucking not.
    My mother goes to bed right on cue (well, maybe closer to 11:15 but it's whatever) and now I'm just waiting for my father to follow suit. Now it's 11:30 and he hasn't budged. No big deal, I'm sure he'll turn in soon enough, I'll just hit up my d-boy and let him know it'll be a little later. 11:45 comes and goes and nothing. Then midnight. Then 12:15. And then 12:30. In the mean time I'm all hyped up on cold meds and becoming aggravated as all tatted Hell. I also keep checking in with my dude just to make sure he hasn't fallen asleep or has decided to tell me to go fuck myself. On top of all of this I'm wrestling with the realization that, even though there's no dope in my hand yet, I've basically already relapsed and have let down everyone in my life who's been supporting me through this. Sigh. 
    Finally, at roughly 12:53, my father decides to shuffle himself into his bedroom and call it a night. Now, I know I need to wait a few minutes before I make any moves to lessen the chances that anyone will still be awake and hear me put the garage door up and coast down the driveway. However, I just can't freaking wait anymore and at m1:00 I'm out the door and on my way to fuck up everything I've worked for over the last month. 
    Of course life isn't done with the curve balls just yet and after I've made the cash advance(s) on my card, I'm no longer able to use if for the rest of the evening (or, morning rather) which means I'm unable to put any gas in my mother's vehicle for when she leaves for work in the A.M. Naturally her car is now on empty and I have absolutely 0 in cash on me. So, I have to sneak back up the driveway and then into my house, directly to my mother's purse for some gas money, then back outside and onto the road so that she's none the wiser in the morning and can make it to work without stopping for gas. 
    After all is said and done, it's 3:45 in the morning and I've pulled my ridiculous hijinks off. Now, of course I picked up enough dope for myself that I still have 3+ buns left for whenever. Now, I know I can't use it all over the next couple days, as that will just jack my tolerance right back up AND cause some physical dependency as well. And I'm sure as fuck not trying to be dope sick in addition to the already heinous plague of some sort that I'm battling. 
    I just went through explaining that to all of you guys so you can see just how much effort I've already fucking put into relapsing. I keep trying to tell myself that this has to be just w one time relapse and that I absolutely HAVE to jump right back into my recovery process. But of course I have those buns on me, which will just make it that much harder. 
    Although it may not seem like it, I really do want this. I want my life back. I don't want to continue to be controlled by this disease. I never want to have a night like I did last night EVER again. But so guess all I can do is try. 
    Anyway, if any of ya'll have any words of encouragement, I sure could use 'em . I have my appointment today to discuss the next step I'm to take in my recovery treatment. Whether it be Intensive Out Patient, regular Out Patient, or some form of One-On-One Counseling, I really need to hit the ground running from here on out. 
    Again, I would like to apologize for this crazy long ass shit post, I just had to get it all off of my chest. Thank you all, so, so, SO much for reading through my wack-ass ramblings. MUCH love$

And if you wouldn't mind, what's the equivalent amount in terms of DPH and/or doxylamine, doses I'm a bit more faimialr with?

Want to know how much fatigue would be setting in by the time you reach recreational doses of codeine.

And a second part, since I'm here. I used to like codeine, but I just can't get off on it anymore. I much prefer kratom and occasional poppy seed tea. I also dislike antihistamines. But my friend claims that the whole ""lean"" thing is legit, and the combo of the two drugs is really good.

I only weigh 180lbs, why is my baseline tolerance so high? Nowadays I keep my use pretty regular, and even though I'm very financially secure, I'm so damn tired of having to pay so much for opioids.

Opioids are the only drugs I use recreationally, but I have used others in the past. My benzo tolerance is normal, and my stimulant tolerance is only slightly higher than average.

Is anyone else in a similar spot? I've used cimetidine and  grapefruit juice and they've helped a little.

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what's wrong with me and how to fix it? Is there any way to upregulate mu opioid receptors? Can long term naltrexone use do the trick?

Precipitated WD (severe pain) after 2mg (although I followed directions about first dose), took another dose every thirty-sixty minutes at 2, 4, 8, 8, 8 mg strips (32 mg total in morning). Anxiety and pain returned after about 6 hours (I was uncomfortable but could handle it for 6 hours).  Four 4 mg doses taken 30 minutes apart (16 MG total in evening) have not made pain abate, and safe oral doses of diazepam and kpin haven't helped sufficiently with anxiety.

I know you're not a doctor, but if you've experienced severe pain and anxiety 16 hours after moving to subs, did it go away within 24-48 hours, or did it take longer? 

I've switched over to subs 3 times in the last year and was always able to dose to comfort level. I feel like more subs can't hurt me, more benzos are a bad idea.

So much pain that I would basically live in bed, rarely leaving home because I won't be able to sit/stand/walk around for more than 20-30 minutes without the pain being too bad to continue. Even sitting in the car on the way to the activity is unbearable. I know I am very dependant on them, I don't ever dillude myself into thinking that I'm not. If I don't take my pills I will feel like shit on top of my everyday pain. The reason I'm thinking about this is because I recently had a family member I'm close to tell me that I'm no better or different than a junky using H on street. It hurt my feelings because i work diligently at keeping my dose as low as it can be. Yea, it's not a low dose at all, but I've been on opiates for nearly 15 years, ever since I was 15. I had a short stint off them after one of my surgeries for a month while recuperating but once I went back to work there was no way to get through with the pain(fusion failed, only 50% fused). Idk, I maintain my life and bills, my husband works and makes enough for both of us. I recently started working again after 2 years off but I have a good job, I make a pretty decent amount of money, and I'm in the career that I wanted to be in and fought to get into. It's a very specialised field, is wish I could say what it is, but between that and other posts it may out me on here as there aren't THAT many people who do what I do. So what if I have to take pain pills every day? They make it so I can live a normal and fully functioning life. Without them I would be home bound, with them I can go out and work finally and live life to my fullest. Yes i will what seems to be forever bound to a calendar(for my doctors appointments every month)but who isn't? I wish this family member could understand what it's like to have pain that never goes away(without having chronic pain) so they could understand why a pain pill is so necessary and leave the judgement at the door. Yes, the chemicals are the same in the end but it also comes down to amount and reasons being taken. You can't boil it down to the fact that I'll be sick without opiates. Going out and recreationally using H is different in my eyes than therapeutically using oxycodone. Hell, I don't even take the Xanax script my doc offers me like every other month. I don't need another substance, I deal with my sleep issues and use a muscle relaxer, which basically makes my body feel heavy buy doesn't particularly help with sleep but at least it's not physically addictive.

I have been prescribed 1-2mg of Ativan daily for years but was just switched to 1-2mg of klonopin daily. I took 1 mg this morning at 8am, 2mg yesterday spread out throughout the day, and 1.5mg Monday. 

Then I found some 15mg oxycodones (no apap, straight oxy) in my room. I haven't taken any oxy in about 3 weeks, but when I do I usually take about 60 mg to achieve that feel. 

I never had any problem with waiting out the Ativan to be processed out of my system before taking an oxy, as I don't like the danger of mixing and the Ativan was out of the system by the end of the day anyway, but since the half life is much longer on the klonopin, I was wondering if it would be safe to take my usual dose of oxy this evening after taking the aforementioned doses of klonopin over the past couple days.

This was my first experience with an inpatient rehab and I did 28 days.  They wanted me to stay longer in long term, but my insurance would not pay for it.  Also I did not get to detox normally off subs, because I was in a psych ward on a 72 hour hold withdrawing from the heroin before I went in.  They gave me fentobarb my first two weeks of rehab for the benzos so I didn't have a seizure.

Anyways the purpose of this post is that this rehab tried pusing AA/NA (12 step program bullshit) that has failed for me in the past, and it is something that won't work for me now.   Some may say I have a shitty attitude or that I am a pussy, but I have severe chronic pain from ulcerative colitis, chronic pancreatitis, Diabetes, Hep C, and I also have persistent depressive disorder, anxiety, and ptsd.  I am not diagnosed with bi-polar but I think I possibly might have it as well.  I am 23 years old and have to live with ALL this shit daily.

The fact is I need to use drugs to get by in life.  For the longest time until I relapsed on H, I used prescribed oxycodone to help with my pain.  Since Pennslyvania just passed a law that just said your primary care physican isn't allowed to prescribe narcotics anymore, I would have to go to a pain clinic, and they would reject me because on my insurance it now says I'm a drug addict.  

Yesterday I was having an ulcerative colitis attack along with my knees hurting like shit, my doctor told me to go to the ER.  I go there, and they said they would only give me toradol or steriods.  I have had bad reactions to toradol in the past and it has done nothing for my pain and steriods are bad for my diabetes.  After trying to explain this, I just said fuck it, and left the hospital without any treatment.   

I WAS NOT DRUG-SEEKING, I EVEN HAD THEM CALL MY DOCTORS OFFICE AND CONFIRM HE TOLD ME TO COME OVER.

I talked to outpatient today, and they gave me a number for a methadone clinic 10 minutes driving distance which is well for me.  Until they set me up, I am gonna keep using drugs, maybe even heroin as I please.  The only reason I quit using in the first place was for my parents.

So my questions are:

- How good is methadone for a person like myself with chronic pain, and do you build a tolerance quickly.

- Do you get a good buzz off methadone?

- Can you get high off other opiates on methadone unlike suboxone (I have heard conflicting reports on this)

- Can I keep my license if I use the methadone?

- I am prescribed klonopin, 0.5 mg x 3 a day.  Will they let me use it with methadone?

- If some pot shows up on a drug test in a methadone clinic, do they kick you out? 

Mainly I am new to the matience programs and I know many of you have gone through this and I would like advice and answers for what I am awaiting next week.

In the mean time I am going to party and enjoy myself.  You may ask why am I even doing this?  Pretty much of 
A. I love my parents and don't want them to find me dead with a syringe in my arm.  They deserve better then that, and all I live for is them.
B. I am 23 and need to get my shit together to be successful.  I am educated and am about to finish community college.
C. Heroin is cut with carbofentaynol and it's killing everyone these days on the east coast.
D. Like I said, I need some sort of drug in my life to help me get through the fucking day.

Thank you for your time and I hope you have something to share.

Is this urgent or can it wait till I can get an appointment?","The night before last, my bf and I were up all night shooting speedballs. I did my last one at about 6am and ptfo'd by 6:30. I woke up at maybe 1pm feeling like complete shit - sweating profusely, fever, somewhat delirious, just all around sickly and extremely uncomfortable. This happened maybe 3 more times until I finally got up at about 7pm, most of the bad feelings having subsided except for general fatigue and a slight temperature. Since then, I've had an on-and-off fever and have been sleeping like crazy - slept from around 5pm to midnight last night, then 3am to 1pm, and another 2-3 hour nap today between the hours of 3pm and 6pm. All day today I've had an awful migraine and an on-and-off slight temperature. I can't be sure if these symptoms are related to the speedball night, but it would seem as if they are. I know it's stupid, but I really, really don't want to go to the ER. I've been once this year for septicemia... they treated me like absolute shit. Their philosophy for detoxing drug/alcohol addicts is ""what goes up must come down"" (genius), which is equal to no comfort meds whatsoever. The last time I was hospitalized they had me cold turkey on top of the septicemia, which was one of the most painful experiences of my life. I woke up on day 2 absolutely DRENCHED in the most foul, rank smelling sweat I have ever produced in my life - it seeped through all my clothes, soaked my bedding, even my hair was dripping with this sickly sweet, syrupy-sticky sweat. I produced a smell that only secretes from the pores of a body that's rotting from the inside out. Anyhow, right now my temperature is sitting at 100 even, I don't have any other symptoms other than a migraine I tamed with ibuprofen a couple of hours ago. What do you guys think? I'm really, really unsure of what to do. I'm thinking in the morning (about 3 hours) I will call the clinic and try to get an appointment (lost my medical access program card, though, and I'm not sure if they will take me w/out it), but I want opinions on if this sounds more urgent than that?

I quit dope and all hard drugs for 3 years. I ended up relapsing of course. I was hanging with my junkie scum ex, so I was using more than I would have if I was just me. One day he said he has a coke connect, so we go to meet this guy and it turns out he sells meth. Well, the good news is that with my semi heavy dope use I didn't develop a habit, but now I'm a mild meth addict. Meaning that I'm defiantly hooked, but I don't use everyday and don't spend money that I don't have on it. This whole time I've been doing meth I've barley touched dope at all. I've gotten some a few times so I could calm down on the meth. I was off all drugs for a few weeks, just picked up meth on Saturday, used a couple days and picked up more today, but I also picked up some dope, which I haven't touched in a while now. But holy shit, I did a goofball and now I'm feeling fine as fuck. I literally only used 1/3 of a stamp, so what I have is gonna last forever lol. I'm already hooked on meth and I don't need another addiction so I'm gonna stick with using it infrequently. I'm even cutting down on meth, no more 7 day binges and shit. My body can't take that shit anymore.

But yeah the whole point of this post was cause I'm curous as to how many opiate users use stims as well. So yeah who else is also into stims? And if so, what stims and how big of a habit do you have? I just think it's crazy how my doc switched from dope to meth, to the point where I don't even think about dope.

**the photo isn't mine but someone i know found all those bags scattered in the middle of a vacant lot one morning. when i saw him post the picture i was thinking ""ugh why couldn't that be me?!""**

i have a couple good stories. i have had bad luck (i.e. getting shorted, losing bags, straight up getting ripped off) but every once in a while i get lucky. 

**story #1 aka ""the time my bf found $600"":**  so this happened in the middle of winter last year when my bf and i were going through a particularly rough time. we had already spent our small portion of rent money on dope, were out of drugs, and were starting to get dope sick. naturally, we were freaking out trying to figure out what to do because we had already sold pretty much everything we could at that point. my boyfriend decided to ride his bike over to the dopeman to see if he would front him a couple bags. 

on his way there, he spotted what looked like a little change purse in the middle of the street. we lived in the hood and he was always finding things on his bike rides (phones, bags of weed, random shit) in the street so he stopped and picked it up. it was a small, plain wallet with literally nothing in it except for SIX HUNDRED FUCKING DOLLARS in fresh, new benjamins. 

because it was so much money and we lived in a poor area, he felt bad taking it all. he checked for any identification but there was nothing there. it was really early, like 5:30am so no one was around. he waited for a while to see if someone would come looking for it but no one ever did. 

finally, he came home and i saw that he had the biggest smile on his face. here, i thought the dope man fronted him a couple bags. to my surprise, he pulls out the $600 and tells me the story. i literally starting crying from happiness because we had been going through a period of absolutely horrible luck; couldn't find steady work, had very little money, and my bf had been mugged a few days prior waiting for a dude to show up with bags and took all our money but also beat my bf with a bat, etc. finding that money allowed us to finally get some dope, food, cigs, and pay our rent. we couldn't have found it at a better time and i still think about it sometimes and thank the universe for finally sending us some good luck.

**story #2 aka how i used to be able to get oxys & roxies ridiculously cheap:** so when i first started using, i was able to get oxy 30s for $10 and 80s for $25 because my girl friend just sold em to me. she would get all these different scripts from a sugar daddy and was more of an uppers/benzos person so she would sell me the painkillers for super cheap because we were friends. 80s usually cost anywhere between $50-$80 at the time in my area. i'll never forget how great those original oxy 80s were! i'd rather have a bunch of them over dope any day because they just made me feel the best. (i only snort, never shoot so that might have something to do with it.) 

after she stopped getting those scripts i found a dude who lived around the corner from me in the hood (older black dude, super nice and ALWAYS prompt which as y'all know is uncommon for dealers) who sold weed, roxies, and benzos. he had just started selling painkillers and didn't know anything about them so he assumed the bigger the pill, the more it should cost. for over a year, i didn't have to pay for roxies because he would sell me 15s for $5. i would buy a bunch and then sell them for $10-$15 (depending on the person) to support my habit. that was amazing but slowly he started raising the price over the years from $5 > $7 >$10 > $13 then finally $15 a pill almost 2 years ago which is when i finally switched to dope. man do i miss those great deals though! i never had money problems when i was doing them.

**story #3 aka the time my bf got 2 bundles for the price of one:** we used to have this really asshole dealer who was just generally a dick in every way. we went to him though because he had the best dope and you could call him 24/7. my bf was getting a bundle from him and naturally he told him to meet him someplace then didn't show up for an hour. my bf was annoyed but figured whatever at least he's here now. 

well when my bf was in the car with him, before they exchanged the money and the drugs, the dealer got out of the car to talk to someone. well my boyfriend turned around to see where he went and the dude had left an entire gallon sized ziplock bag filled with bundles out in the backseat of the car (like a fucking dumbass). so super quick my bf grabbed a bundle (he didn't wanna take more because the guy was a few feet away and he didn't know if he knew the full count). the dude came back, served him, and never mentioned the missing bundle.

**so do y'all have any awesome drug stories to share? too often we hear stories on here about things going wrong, i want to hear some where things ended up way better than expected.**",1475035667.0

Pleasantly suprised,"So this these people have bought a large looking shed, one you would see in a back yard or something, right across from a strip club with a big spray painted sign that says KRATOM. I've passed it many times and always wanted to stop in and see what its about.

The reason for their location is because its 1 mile past the border or Arkansas in Missouri. Kratom is already illegal in Arkansas. But anyway it was 9pm when I pulled up. I didnt know weather to go in or knock so I opted to knock. Dude opens the door and I walk in and ask what this place is about and what not. We get to the nitty gritty and I ask for the most potent strain as I have a high tolerance to opiates.

He says hold on let me get the owner, he walks out to the RV trailer posted up right by the makeshit kratom shed and they both come back. He tells me they have to sell it as incense but if i'm looking for the best burning (wink wink) I should go with G Indo.
So i bought a ounce for 20 bucks to test it out.

I got home and did the toss and swallow method, probably 4g and im not necessarily high per se, but it does have quite a nice euphoria and is moderately sedating. So yeah i bought some kratom from a shed.

Anyone have any tips, advice, or just want to join in on this kratom convo? I know jack shit about it. Oh and its powdered by the way.

The most worthwhile is the low dose naltrexone. It can really help you recover faster and is a good way to beat PAWS on an accelerated timeline. You can also take it in ULDN (ultra low dose) alongside your opiate of choice to help you lower tolerance, reduce the build up of dependency, and potentiate. I can get a compounding pharmacy to make it in the different dosages and put in a liquid solution so you just take a drop. I've found many people are wary of using it because they are afraid of messing up the dosages. It's also very overpriced on any sites online.

If it has to be removed I understand. I wrote up this first half over a year ago but never finished it, Do y'all think this is something I should finish? Has anyone else here used writing to get past something? And if you do read it please leave a comment and tell me what you think!

Back in January 2015 I had a blood clot ""kill"" me and I managed to come back to life. I want to write about this experience to help me get over it so hopefully it doesn't haunt me for years down the road. I feel like I am a decent writer but not a great writer so I just want to get some criticism as to how you think the writing started and if you think I should make any changes. so without anymore delay, here is what i have so far:

The day that changed my life. The day was Friday, January the 16th, 2015. It started like any other normal day, or so I thought. I was 23, still living at home with my mom, and working a minimum wage job delivering pizzas at Dominos. I was scheduled a little bit earlier that day than normal, but only by one hour. I got to work at 4 that afternoon and I was having pretty irregular chest pains but I decided to just ignore them because the last time I went to my doctor over these sort of pains I was told that is was just because of what I had ate the night before. At work we were rather slow for a Friday, I didn't get to take my first run until nearly an hour after I got to work, when on a normal day I would have had a delivery waiting on me the second that I walked in the door. That delivery was to a trailer park that was notorious for not tipping and although we are told to not smoke cigarettes on the way to a delivery but instead smoke them after you make the delivery and you are on the way back to the store, I decided I was going to smoke a cigarette on the way to this delivery anyways because I knew I wasn't going to get a tip. They only tell you to wait on smoking a cigarette so that way you don't smell like a fresh ash tray while you are dealing with the customer. Well my decision to smoke a cigarette before the run might have been one of the worst decisions that I have made in my entire life...

I got to the customers house and I felt the chest pains come back and start getting stronger and stronger as I was walking up to their door, and I was having a lot of trouble catching my breath, I remember getting very dizzy and light headed because of the trouble that I was having breathing. When I got back in my truck to drive back to the store, I lit back up the cigarette that I didn't finish and hit the road. As I pulled around back behind the store and parked my truck, I flicked my cigarette out the window into a muddy puddle while I started to get a little nervous about the pains that were coming back in my chest. I walked in the back door and started walking to the front of the store, only to stop short in the managers office because I needed to lean against his desk while I tried to catch my breath. I started to panic a little while I was in the office because for some reason I couldn't catch my breath no matter how hard I was breathing. I was inhaling and exhaling as hard as I possibly could in a desperate attempt to breathe.

I was getting extremely light headed while I leaned against the desk there, I had been leaning against the desk now for about 30 seconds and I was wondering how I could feel as though I was suffocating while I was standing there. This was not making any sense, and I was starting to get very weak from not getting any oxygen, I could barely stand up anymore and I could feel the world spinning around me, I started to develop tunnel vision and a black border was forming around my vision. While it felt like it was taking a very long time, my vision kept on getting smaller and smaller until I completely lost my ability to see, it felt like it took awhile for my vision to stop but in reality it only took about 5 seconds for that to happen. I was very weak, I could barely hold myself up, I was suffocating, choking, and gagging on nothing, but I could not breathe at all. I could feel my veins throbbing and I felt what I thought was one in my head explode which just made me panic even more at this point. I struggled to do so but I managed to throw myself at the door of my managers office and feel my way up to the front of the store where my manager and other co workers were in a desperate attempt to get them to see me before anything happened to me. I couldn't talk or yell at this point, and I was trying to, hard. I was crying by this point, and I mean I was sobbing, I am 23 years old, and I was suffocating to death.

I knew that I feared death, and that I was taking my last breath, I knew that this was the end of my life, I knew that I was about to die and there was nothing I could do to stop it. The only thing that I wanted to do was pull out my phone and call my mom, All that I wanted to do was tell her that I was sorry. I wanted to tell her that I was sorry for everything, I wanted to apologize for everything. But most importantly, I wanted to tell her that I loved her. That she was the most important person in the world to me, and that I wanted her to not worry about me because it was my time. It had only been 3 seconds of while I managed to head towards the front of the store that I thought about all of this. The only thing that I didn't understand though is what was actually going on. I felt my body start to get cold and I felt my limbs go limp, I could feel my heart slowing down, and I could see my lack of vision start to go white, almost like a light. I couldn't figure out what was going on, what I was feeling, until it hit me that I knew exactly what was going on. It was right then that I figured it out. I had actually figured it out, I realized that this was my dance with death. I finally knew what death was like, and know this, I managed to make myself calm down, I managed to make myself crack a smile as I finally took my last breath, I could feel my knees buckle and my body start to fall. For some reason I was no longer panicking, and I was at peace with what was happening. I fully embraced what was happening because I could feel my world end. I could feel myself dying.

Today my dude hands me a Subutex because their prescription got switched up. Anyway, I'm trying to figure out the best taper plan. At this point, I believe I'm taking around .63mg, give or take. 

I feel like Subutex is going to be harder to dose. I took the last of my Suboxone this morning and just took a bit of the Subutex (probably not even .25mg of it). My question is how hard is it going to be for me to taper even further and what's the best rule of thumb for tapering off of Subutex? I kind of want this 8mg to be the last for me. 

Also, if I were to start using oxys again how long should I wait after getting off of the subs? I know it's really stupid to even be talking about that, but I know how I am.

Anywho, I imagine many of you know about the impending kratom ban and the repercussions that has for recovering opiate addicts as well as people with chronic pain. Also the recent spike in overdoses due to carfentanil (also the kg shipments of carfentanil that were seized around the time the ODs started piling up) and that fucked up news story where the cops supposedly found some kid with his grandparents ODing in the front of the car (there are a lot of discrepancies in how they are related to the child, idk if it was bullshit or not) which has contributed to the supposed ""opiate epidemic"" that has been occurring in the United States. Now to the tinfoil, WHAT IF all of these news stories were supposed to be to strike fear into the simple laymen of America who dare not question their righteous government and let the Kratom ban slip by either ignored by or supported by the ignorant masses? Iirc kratom is also cited as an ""epidemic"" and having no benefits. What if all of these coincidental (not really the grandparents + kid story) things were a false flag of sorts to scare the masses into a frenzy to illegalize (is that a word?) another harmless plant? Also, big pharma would definitely be for taking out any competitors to their addictive medicines. 

Thank you for reading through my rant/tinfoil and let me know if formatting is trash because I'm on mobile.

54tm6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/54tm6p/info_how_to_make_uldn_and_oxytrex_dosages/,3,https://redd.it/54tm6p,CryYouWhineyBitch,Info: How to make ULDN and Oxytrex dosages,"So, I'm back to opioids and am trying a clean start with ultra low dose Naltrexone to see if addiction can be avoided. In the past, I have successful used ULDN to lower my tolerance, but my usage was too high to attempt to come all the way back. 

&nbsp;

I was up to 3 full jabs a day or nearly 40 bags of dope and was still unable to get high. I started ULDN and got my tolerance low enough to get high again. I started off with 5 mcg (micrograms, .005 mg) of ULDN. I was snorting and taking the ULDN orally. It didn't help, so I kicked it up to .1 mg every 4 hours. That was enough to let me get high again, but not to avoid withdrawals. I could no longer afford it. Even though I was buying g-packs of 160 bags, that was still $250 a day and I wanted to have nice things with my high paying job so I just went to the hospital. 

&nbsp;

Anyways, I was clean for 2 months up until a week ago. I'm now snorting dope and taking 100 mcg every 4 hours. So far, no real withdrawals in the morning. I'm on about 4 bags a day. I'm thinking of upping it after finding out more info about Oxytrex, a drug in testing that combines oxycodone and Naltrexone. Here are the rumored Oxytrex dosages in Oxycodone/Naltrexone:

&nbsp;

* 10mg/1.2mg
* 20mg/2.4mg
* 30mg/3.6mg
* 40mg/4.8mg
* 60mg/7.2mg
* 80mg/9.6mg

&nbsp;

This sounds more like just LDN. The original papers for the ULDN idea stated 5 mcg with each shot of dope though. I'm thinking that snorting or eating must require a higher dosage. Has anyone tried ULDN/LDN with snorting? Did it work and what was the dosage? 

&nbsp;

Anyways, here's to math to make ULDN:

&nbsp;

Pmg = Naltrexone pill in milligrams

Pmcg = Naltrexone in micrograms 

WL = Volume of water in liters

Wml = Volume of water bottle you're using in milliliters

Nml = Milligrams of Naltrexone per milliliter

Nd = Micrograms of Naltrexone in 1 drop

&nbsp;

Convert from Naltrexone milligrams to micrograms: 

Pmg x 1000 = Pmcg

&nbsp;

Convert liters of water to milliliters:

WL x 1000 = Wml

&nbsp:

Find amount of Naltrexone per milliliter when mixed: 

Pmcg ÷ Wml = Nml

&nbsp;

Find how many mcg of Naltrexone per drop of mixture:

Nml ÷ 20 = Nd

&nbsp; 

So, if you want to take 100 mcg of Naltrexone, simply do: 

100 ÷ Nd

&nbsp;

Now let's do a common example with a 50 mg Naltrexone and a 2 liter bottle of water: 

(50 x 1000) ÷ (2 x 1000 x 20) = 1.25 mcg Naltrexone per drop

&nbsp;

Here's something you just plug into Google:

N = Size of Naltrexone pill in milligrams 

L = Volume of water in liters

&nbsp;

Replace the variables worth your numbers and pop right into Google search:

&nbsp;

(P * 1000) / (L * 1000 * 20)

&nbsp;

So let's say it's a 50 mg Naltrexone and a half liter. Put this right in the Google search box: 

(50 * 1000) / (.5 * 1000 * 20)

&nbsp;

Google will return the micrograms power drop. 

&nbsp;

[Here's an example with 50mg/2L](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=(50+*+1000)+%2F+(2+*+1000+*+20)&l=1)

&nbsp;

**Instructions for oral**

* Get 1 pill of Naltrexone
* Get 1 bottle or container you know the volume of
* Get a clean sheet of paper
* Crush up the pill. Good, but doesn't need to be perfect
* Fold your paper in half to crease it
* Sweep crushed pill into paper 
* Bend paper so powder slides down the crease
* Dump it into the bottle
* Fill bottle with known amount of water
* Shake well, let sit, repeat a few times
* Dump a little in the cap
* Suck it into the a dropper 
* (optional) Fill small glass with a little water
* Drop one drop at a time into glass counting micrograms 
* Drink the glass of water

&nbsp;

**Mainlining**

Just drop the drops into your shot and shoot together

&nbsp;

Anyways, I'm upping my dose of ULDN. I'm gonna go for 100 mcg every 4 hours and see how that goes. If anyone has a better dosing idea, let me know.

I run/exercise a lot and I plan on pushing myself to work out this evening.  

I have 6mg of Xanax on hand and may try to get a little more.  My question is... For those that have tapered, what is the intensity of withdrawal?  I have detoxed off of suboxone before but never this way.  I want to make sure I will be ok to start my job on Monday.

To get to the main point of this post, I was watching some netflix earlier in order to procrastinate on a blog post I was supposed to be writing. I've been watching a lot of Bojack Horseman lately (**mild spoilers ahead**). It's a show with dark, wacky humor, and many of the episodes are designed to be very relevant to current events and issues. The main character in the show is an alcoholic, so obviously there's quite a bit of commentary on addiction, particularly alcoholism. None of this bothers me or gives me cravings. If anything, it makes me want to stay clean and avoid the lifestyle of addiction. Then out of nowhere they bring up heroin in the show. I don't want to be too specific for the sake of not being a spoiler, but the one episode I just watched triggered me really fucking hard. I'm sitting here smoking cig after cig, cause I'd rather pick up that habit again than dope. Fuck my neurotransmitters. I was gonna try to limit myself to 2 mg of sub today in order to shorten the duration of my taper but I'm probably gonna take a little more now.

Right now he says he is taking something to stop him taking opiates or any other drug. From what I gathered he was speaking of an opiate blocker but I am unsure and he could flat out be lying about what it is.

I have seen him take it and it disolves in water with a bit of a yellow look, the yellowishness of the water is very slight but makes me believe its a recreational.
I also can not find any possible medication it could be that dissolves. Whatever it is, he took it shortly before he decided to stop opiates so its either helping him deal with his addiction or its a drug replacement.

I've lost her, and she lost herself. Well, she has been lost for quite some time now. Opiates completely consumed her life to the point where she lost everything. Her house, her car, her education, any of course any money she came across wether belonging to her or not, the lack of trust of everyone around her including her family and myself. She was the most beautiful, thoughtful, smart, caring person I've ever met. Opiates altered her personality to the point of being I recognizable. I guess this is a ""shit post,"" as many call it, but I find it therapeutic to share the experience with people who are familiar with this lifestyle and the demons that are associated with it. She now hates me because I prevented her from scoring one last time before heading off to rehab. I won't put my life on hold for her, but if she is willing to allow me back into her life, I would consider myself lucky and would be as supportive as I could possibly be without putting my life at risk. She went voluntarily and seems to want to beat her addiction problem. Has anyone had any positive experiences with a loved one returning successfully and successfully ""restarted"" a positive relationship? I completely understand this is a life-long battle, likely with relapse(s), but I am willing to support her as long as she makes the effort. 

Thanks for any advice/input you may have. I've never experienced this before. ",1475124066.0

He was all I had man. I don't have many positive things in my life. He was pretty much it. He was the best dog I've ever had. & Ive had many over the years, but none I *really* cared about. I mean, yea, I cared about them, ofc I loved them and took care of them. But this dog was different. We understood each other on a level I never thought possible between two different species. We loved each other. He was the best friend I've ever had. Human or animal be damned.

He loved everyone and everything. Other dogs, cats, people, even peoples pet rats/rodents. He just wanted to be friends with everyone. Ive watched him defend people from my neighbors asshole mutt, and vice versa, protecting dogs from their own abusive owners. He was the coolest fucking dog to ever exist. He cared about others well-being, as crazy as that sounds. Ive seen him share his food with hungry animals. He could pick up on peoples emotions and comforted people when they were upset. I swear this little dog was a person reincarnated. His social skills were too damn intuitive. He was as sweet as sweet can be.

And thats the worst part imo. I live in a fairly rual area and I know it was the Coyotes that got him. And I know for damn sure that he was the one to approach them. I can see him in my mind, trotting up to them, wanting to be friends and play. He probably had his tail wagging right up until they decided to tear him limb from limb. Those fucking bastards. In the end, it was his kindness that did him in. A pretty good representation of how the world really works. Because thats the true nature of karma, isn't it? Good people get fucked. The bad people rise to the top and get what they want. And in the end we all end up in the same place. No rewards, no penalties for your behavior. Eternal darkness for all. There is no divine justice. Only nothingness.

I know this isn't the most appropriate place for this. Sorry about that. I just feel like this place is my home sometimes. And I felt like I needed to get this out.

**RIP Woogie.** You will be missed very, very dearly.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/ysxhM) is a pic of him if anyone cares. On top of being awesome and having a heart of gold he was adorable to boot. 

Fuck, god can be cruel. This dog was a fucking saint and my best fucking friend. Of course the universe had to take him away from me. Its taken everything else I have, I wonder why I thought it'd let me keep something as perfect as him. & on top of everything, I'm dope sick too. Wow, what a shitty day this is.

Anyway. Thanks for reading this if you did. Sorry for boring you if I did. I hope everyones day is going a little better than mine is.  Stay safe everyone

____________________________________________________________________________________________

**Edit:** Thank you everyone for the kind words. They mean more than you can imagine. This is why I love this board.


For everyone asking; Im gonna be okay. It hurts right now. & I don't think ill be getting another dog for a long time. It took me years and years to find a dog like him. He was only 2 years old, and he was mine for even less. I don't think another pet could ever match up even a little. He was truly one in a million. It just feels like it was too soon.

But ill be okay. Thanks again everyone. Love all of you

Do you find that a smaller dose could give you the same high as a much larger dose? Or that maybe your mood affected the high much more than we expect?,I've had 30mg doses that got me just as high as 70-80mg would days apart. Also when I was younger and norcos were a lot easier to find i would take sometimes up to 6-7 and somtimes not even feel a high at all because of shitty things happening to me while I was trying to come up and peak on my high(which I had paid good money for even back then). Like pill highs are so easy to predict (as almost most ROAs are if you know your body) but having shitty events or a fight with a girlfriend would almost always kill my high to completely nothing and I would be absolutely furious. Did this happen to any of you while dosing hydrocodone? Or oxycodone? I'm not talking about getting pissy after you come down. I find that normal for most people I've come across. Also hydrocodone highs always wave in and out where oxycodone is more consistent and steady. Here's what I have next to me now. Haven't dosed in about 24 hours so this should be good I'll be taking them before 830pm western.

I have a fun question. What are your favorite genres/artists to listen to while on opioids? I enjoy triphop, ambient, psybient when I'm feeling particularly chill. Things like Emancipator, Shpongle, Ott, etc. Occasionally some old school dancehall reggae (Beenie Man, Ky-Mani Marley, Damian Marley).

The reason I ask is for two reasons. For one, I'm just curious and interested because this subreddit has a ton of interesting people. Secondly, if all works out tomorrow and my friend comes around to 'help out' with my dental pain, I will likely be throwing down some mixes and I'm interested in checking out some new music I might acquire beforehand. 


TL;DR What is your favorite music to listen to on opiates? Need suggestions. Anything at all!

You used to say we grew up together, but I don't think that's true. I think you grew up fast and cruel. I think you preyed upon me with your words so sweet and your smell so intoxicating. Who was it that twisted you to the point of breaking? Is that when you dedicated your life to taking?

We dreamed together. Those Sundays when we'd get lost in our thoughts together was our church. You filled me with a single beam of silver sunlight, and told me that's all I needed to see. Remember the time we stayed in bed, you embracing me warmly, for two days? I think I will never be happier than I was right then. But now our bed is empty and I'm haunted by you. Was any of it real? The feelings I felt... Did you just simulate them? You did, didn't you? I don't think you felt any of it at all. In fact I doubt you can feel anything at all. Well a big round of applause for the beautiful bitch in the designer stamp bag, you've won. 

You broke me as you broke countless others before me, falling like stalks of corn before you. And as we bow to you in eternal reverence and shame, your thirst for more grows. I fell in love with a vampire, and your steely fangs pump my veins for all I'm worth. 

So I've walked with your bite marks. I've carried your weight, the lives we've ruined together. And I'm coming to realize... I am coming to realize that you made a monster of me, for I will always love you. And I think about you often, your icy touch fresh in my head.

Being able to dose when I feel sicker gives me a sense of control while I tapper, and the discomfort is not even half that of full-on WDs.

My experience with this drugs is terrifying. I hate the way it makes me feel and I've done too much before and it almost killed me. But I hate even feeling clammy. 

How would one ingest this for quickest effect and how would one ingest it for most efficient effect? I snorted the tiniest of lines of a white pill in the past and it almost killed me. Never seen these pink fuckers. Which tells me it packs a bigger punch in a smaller pill.

The literal and metaphorical cost isn't worth it to me anymore, so I flushed over a grand of heroin down the toilet last night at exactly midnight. Tapering  was out of the question for me, as there's no way I'd have kept to it. I would VERY much like to seek help. I was doing 100mg (measuered, not eyeballed) of #4 insufflated about 3-4 times a day. I don't know if that's considered a lot or a little, but it's a lot more than I started with.

I don't want to lose my Xanax and adderall script though. I haven't abused them, and I've been on them before recreational use was even a thought I'm my mind. If I had to I could live without adderall, but Xanax for anxiety attacks I absolutely cannot. 

While I could probably put up with how I feel currently for about a week, if it gets any worse I couldn't. Of I went and got treatment, no clinic could forcibly hold me inpatient could they? I have an exam and a homework due Monday.

More importantly, how would current and future medical treatment change for me? I was hospitalized for a ruptured 'sappendix and caught pneumonia shortly after, and I took my prescribed  medicine as instructed. Weeklong pain relief trumps a high that only lasts a few hours when the pain is that bad. I personally witnessed one situation where a patient who was stunned in a mugging and had a punctured lung was not only denied opioids to take home during recovery, he surgerybut also WHEN HE WAS IN THE DAMN HOSPITAL because he had traces of THC inbox system. HOLY SHIT A POT SMOKER YOU GUYS HOW TERRIBLE. Going through a  illness like my pneumonia that put me in the hospital or any situation where I'm recovering from a surgery will without prescribe opioids 10 years ago would be worse than withdrawal

Please answer quick guys I can't wait much longer

Update: Thanks for the support guys. I know that on internet forums  it's a phrase tossed around with no real feeling behind it and just for karma, what I'm about to say is legitimate: Everyone wishing me a speedy recovery means so much to me. My mom hates me and she doesn't even know about my current drug use. I've.been clean since July 2015 to her. She hates me because I don't believe in God. I'm not even a fedora tipper, I've never mocked or debated anyone let alone her about religion, in fact, if I could make myself believe in God I would. That sort of story brings so much more comfort than obllivion. Or knowing that if there was a god it'd more likely be some incomprehensible Lovecraftian nightmare living at a level of existence so higher than ours that they could make us goextimct without noticing like how our immune systems go on a bacterial genocide on a daily basis


Anyways to the real update: I asked a lot f people in the thread so I'll ask it up here too

**Can I keep my psych (go legally can't give it out anyways) separate from the doctor at a opioid replacement clinic?**

Also, yes I still feel like shit, but I took some xanax so I'm not crying anymore lol. Ive got enough clonazolam to last a year but there's no way I'm taking benzos regularly again. Opioid withdrawal is like getting the flu and having your wife leave you. Benzos is all that plus your on fire and your eyes are made of ants (yes that's a rick and Morty reference lol)

**Last update for the night**
Well I'm just going to have to call and see if opioid replacement therapy will brand me an addict and deny me painkillers in the emergency room or if I have to come off of the two  medications that actually help me but address abused by some. I swear to Christ I've never abused prescription drugs nor have I lied to a doctor or psychiatrist to get a medicine to abuse but to them I'm a worthless junkie. Even if they believed my true claim they still might take it away just because I'm a loathsome junkie to them and not even a human who used opioids only because they brought relief to otherwise endless state of depression, anxiety, and self hatred. I have and will never lie, steal, or take advantage of someone to cure my own misery. Just as I had no reason to live before opioids, I won't have one afterwards as well. It's not like some demon drug possessed a happy young lad and overwrote the line here had for his girl and his ambitions for the future. They just filled in the whole where my heart should have been. 

If I can't take my medications or receive relief from the ER the next time an organ inside me explodes and receive treatment to make me quit the one thing that's kept me alive since spring 2014 then I think I may have to just call it quits guys. Got a a gram of fent , some oakheart and coke, and  saved away with name on it. You've always been the realest, even though I've never physically met you, y'all have always given a shit.

They would just zone out while I read it out and told me what they thought I wanted to hear.. Anyway here it is.


Ahyooo lets roll that bowl and let the truth unfold. 
Smoldering glass..    
Cold nights untold.     
Rock shards that make your dick hard.    

Just dont start with all that ""A Class will cause scars and leave you in the dark without light and no path and at the end, a harsh past full of laughs but no advance"" because as far as im concerned, advance is subjective, and your opinion is selective in accordance with whos present.     

Im the one who gets it, and in my experience..    
My life is just a lesson woven with self expression, tangled in self oppression, fighting the acceptance and judgements with aggression and rebellion.   

I made life my steed and I ride it like a stallion. 
I wear that part of my life like a medallion and rep it everyday like im selling it.    
Your opinion is irrelevent.    
You cant compare to my emotional, physical and mental development.    
I've spent life in my element.    
Experience for the sake of experience because I'm talented. 

You've spent life caught up in the hype of whats ""right"".    
""In the fight we call life""    
Making sure every decision you make is right for your life.    
So you can have the right job and the right wife with the right house with the right dog.    
You dont know what its like to ""live life"".    
You live in strife while the pressure of ""right"" strikes you, binding you tight, making sure your inner light is exstiguished. Until your inner character is diminished.    
No longer left to linger and hinder the force who enforce such disorder. Theres more to explore out there than just your warped idea to adhere to the rules they put there, to make you dissappear into the distance.    
Fade into a statistic.    
Merely existing.    
Your freedom? A figment of a lack of an imprint you call being part of a system.    
So just listen because this could be over in an instant.    
Look past the fear and despair, truth appears in your eyes, now its about time that that line you've been towing, rips.    
So you can fall when you trip, experience the trip and the hit. Find the balance between not giving a shit and being on to it. In fact I'll leave you with this swift but not so slick little limerick.

If you sit on the fence of both sides and dont try to get down, because on either side snakes slither around.    
Then you know the truth will only be found, in the space where the snakes dont cover the ground.    
So look all around and you'll definitely see, the space where the snakes cannot be.    
And if you swing through the trees with you're own sway, you'll form your own path and make your own way.    
To the place in the shade where you'll live out your days. For all the right reasons in all the right ways.

Assuming that these drugs are being used IV do they equate to each other mg for mg?  Are they truly identical drugs with the only difference being the time release added to the capsule?

The Dilauded is very easy to process, provides a cleaner injection with no fillers and it leaves no waste residue after prep.  Is the Dilauded also stronger?  Is my desire to do Dilauded at a greater frequency then the Contin because it's a greater high I am chasing?

On top of this, the only person that I have ever loved only wants a superficial friendship with me after a failed love relationship and she was the one that would understand me and support me the best. 

I've been having this pain in my chest for the past three weeks and no other anti depressants work. I don't really understand why I'm doing this anymore and I don't even know how much longer I can handle this.

So, I have to reuse rigs (I know this is bad, but I haven't any other options until I get a package in the next day or so from another /r/opiates member who was kind enough to offer to send clean works.  Thank you again!), and my current stick has seen better days.  I sharpened with a striking pad (again, I don't recommend anybody do this, but for me, ""any port in a storm"").  I popped the point in, and before I even registered, I felt a sharp pain that was much more than I usually get.  The pain only stopped once I finally registered, and the rest of the injection went no problem.  Did I hit a nerve?  A tendon?  Or is it just the whole ""sticking myself with beyond used needles"" causing me problems.  I'm throwing out the stick and toughing it out until the package arrives but can somebody enlighten me?

Like you can keep using as long as you are safe, as you long as you don't overdoes or use dirty stuff. So lets say clean fentanyl nasal spray, my example because this is what I use, for life you are ok.

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/crosstown-clinic-heroin-addiction-1.3779768

In that article there even one of the top opiate doctors in the world says that a user can live a normal life for 100 years as long as they use clean opiates and do not overdose. What are your thoughts on this friends.

Ok second matter of the fact. So I am using fentanyl nasal spray every day and my tolerance has become a joke. I did the conversion and I am using something like a GRAM OF OXYCONTIN based on the fentanyl I'm using. 1 mg of feet = about 200-400 mg of oxy.

Ok so now for question number two, I just got 5 G74's in the mail (40mg opana) what should I do with these as I doubt they will get me high. Should I just completely rail one for fun and save the rest for a rainy day or when I'm in withdrawals? Or should I just use them and not really get high, feel like its a huge waste.

P.S.
You just are my fucking best friends always so kind, always so honest and helpful. I LOVE YOU PEOPLE LIKE I SERIOUSLY LOVE YOU.

Anyway, I have been using U4 for a bit now, 5-6 months, but nnow I will no longer have access to it due to it being emergency scheduled. 

Anyway, to get to my question... I started w/ opiates 2-3 years ago, and since the beginning of this year really got deeper into my habit. I went through 5g of U4 in my first 6 weeks, and then slowly progressed to a half gram every day at my worst.

I have done dope before, but it was tar and I was with a friend. However this time I have procured some #4 from a local friend and would like to know what a good starting amount is.

I own a scale, so I can weigh pretty accurately down to the couple of mgs.

I needed about 40-50mg per dose (at my worst) however now days my tolerance is probably at 25mg will get me high, 40mg will have me nodding.

Has anyone here had some experience with U4 so they can weigh in on dose equivalency?

I have tried switching to 80mg OP but find them not only weak, even chewed or ""melted"" in coke cola, but the energy that I get from roxi isnt there. Its more numbing and a ""sleepy"" kind of high.

Recently found old school crushable OC 120's for a fraction of what I pay for roxi and even OP formula, but I have never had a OC oxy before and was wondering if its more like the OP type of sleepy high or energetic like roxi...ive asked the question to other people and most just say oxy is oxy and its all the same, just different amounts due to the time release nature of the OP but I swear they just dont seem to do it for me nor do they even last much longer than roxi, maybe 2 hrs for roxi vs 3-4 for OP. So given that these OC are crushable and thus not time released, I am hoping they are similar to regular oxy IR.
