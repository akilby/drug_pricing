The stash was around 200 A215 30s, 150 A214 15s and about 200 C230 10s. When I bonded out of jail I immediately went to get my stash, took 4 30s and snorted another and went to see an attorney. I brought up the fact that these pills may exist to the attorney and he told me that the authorities were probably (obviously) watching my activity and that it would be very stupid if I had anything like that with me since I had been driven by a family member and would be putting them in risk. This being an extremely stressful and emotional time I panicked  at the thought of getting my family into trouble and flushed them all..... 

It has now been about 90 days that I've been mostly clean but with a prison sentence set to begin at the end of the month all I can think about is those fucking pills.

I moved to the South and was clean for about 2 months, until I found the holy 40mg pandas and decided I had to try it. 

Boyyy it was awesome, I’ve only done it about 4 times in the past month because it’s expensive down here for opana, like 100$ a 40mg. Well the panda kinda reignited my love for opiates and I decided I want to try H once and for all since my friend circle talks highly about it. Now when I was using Oxy, towards the end my girlfriend and I wanted to switch to H because of money, spending 600 a day for our habit is crazy. 

I had a good friend(before I moved) who was also a dboy, he would help me get pills occasionally when my plug was out, one day I asked if he could get me dope. He straight up said he’d rather not be the one to help me bc he didn’t want to further my addiction or take me down that road. That’s was about 4 months ago, 2 months before I decided to move 18 hours away. 

So after being down here for a bit and fucking with pandas I decided to ask a good friend to help me get some H. The prices are ridiculous being im from an east coast state bmore , I know the prices back home and they are double that down here, quite literally. I had purchased .2 thru my friend for 40$, should have been 20 back home lol. 

Well I get home, my girl decided she wanted to go first and I would wait a few minutes to make sure she was okay. We chopped up small bumps and she did one waited did one and waited, in about 10 minutes she says it’s def an opiate but it reminded her of Oxy as it was tame to her. Well I probably did about .13 and she did the other .07, we had .2 in all.

I did all mine within 20 minutes like she did, she looked visibly high an said it was good but not great. I on the other hand didn’t feel to much, I could feel the H wanting to get me high but I would start to get that opi feeling in my body and neck and it would just stop a few minutes in. Now she felt good for about 2 or 3 hours, we have the same tolerance(for all opiates we’ve done), but different body weight, her being 130 and me being 220. 

So I caught myself wondering why people get addicted to heroin if it’s just like pills or weaker, I couldn’t honestly say the H was better then Oxy, but I could say panda was better then both by far. 

Is the reason I didn’t get that high bc of tolerance? 
(Haven’t used in 2 weeks before this)
Maybe my body weight? 
Or maybe I just did so little it didn’t really affect me? 

Either way I am disappointed to say the least, I do want to give it another shot, but for the price and effect, I’m not sure if it’s worth it. This whole idea is crazy bc I was addicted to H before I even did it. I’d watch docs about it, have dreams I’m snorting H and getting a rush then waking up. I’ve wanted H for so long, that when I finally got it I was disappointed.

TLDR: Bought H for the first time, did over a .1 with weak tolerance , didn’t feel much(honestly), was disappointed how weak it felt, girlfriend was having good time on .07, told her I felt it was a waste bc I didn’t even get high",1521571919.0

I always like reading cold cop stories here so i figured you'd like this one of mine. Happened a few months ago

Now i don't cold cop. I've done it a few times but i have too much to lose for the risk

Was in a major city on business for the night but i don't live there and have to take public transit home. Last ride out is somewhere just before midnight. 

So the meeting lets out at about 8 and we're in a highly populated area but now I'm tossed and on my own. I'm usually too scared of getting arrested to ever try this but it isn't called liquid courage for nothing. I find a homeless guy nodding out on a sidewalk and offer him some of the cut if he can help me score some dope. He's a Latino guy around my age and happily obliges. We start walkin to his guy.

Bein drunk i violate rule 1 and give him the cash while he tells me to wait on a block. But i don't wait. I walk across the street following where he's going. After about 10 blocks i catch up w him thinking there's no reason to make me wait back there unless he's taking the money and running so i confront him. Get the $ back in my hand.  We end up in McDonalds after McDonalds talking to every fiend from the tall white hippie who looks like he'd scalp you for a dime to the fat old war vet with one and a half hands. 

He finds this chick and mumbles something to her and she asks me to follow her now. She's a long thin black woman with hoop earrings big enough to put a fist through. She's also a he. We take a silent awkward cab uptown and get out near this older black woman in a safety vest. She gives me a sample of something that feels like nothing to me and the tranny thinks that's funny as fuck. I follow both of em into a back alley where they smoke some rock (which they kindly offered me but i don't care for it and politely declined)

Finally we get to this crusty studio apt occupied by the sweetest old black couple as well as a dump trucks worth of garbage and a small tv. They were watching some history shit i think. I sit down with them my calves are burning now and my buzz wearing off. It's past 1145 at this point so i was def missing my ride home. Fuck. But i was in too deep to give up

The husband was chill. His voice was deep and hoarse and could prob do a mean screamin Jay Hawkins. They asked all about me, not bc i was any kinda threat but out of genuine curiosity. Lent me a smoke which i burned inside. Sat there for 2 hours till their guy picked up the phone and the husband walked me across the street while he went up to get what i came for. Two young runners stood outside the building yelling out to passersby and cars with open windows (we were in the projects at this point). My guy comes out and slips me bun while i throw him a 20. I had now thrown a good $100 at all the people who were trying to helpme that night. Took a cab home and was in bed by 4am. 

I know it's all a business and money can make you some friends, but pretty much all these people -- esp the old couple -- were generous as fuck and kind. Was an adventure I'll remember for a while

Coming from someone who has taken a few extra Oxys/hydros after a surgery on a few occasions and never really gotten into it I’d just like to hear about your first experience with heroin: what led you to take the drug in the first place, what it was like deciding to finally do it, who you were with/if others influenced you to partake, when did you begin to IV (if ever), etc. I’ve experimented with plenty of substances before and opiates were just never one of the ones I got into for whatever reason, so this isn’t coming from a judgmental perspective, simply from someone fascinated by the topic of drugs, addiction and opiates (heroin especially due to the particular stigmata associated with it) especially with all the attention they have gotten in the US media lately. 

Can’t wait to hear what you guys have to say, much love!",1521569303.0

Anyhow my inquiry was he's getting suspicious and threatened to kick me out of he catches me using again and this is after a few slip ups I've been caught for so big fucking deal man. Anyways I did like 11 norcos over the past five days and he's in the hospital with the flu so I can get detox to clean piss if he decides to piss test me my question is do you think I can get through this in the probable 5 days plus he's in the hospital. I'm also spending my days and nights there feeling like an anxious fat fuck  like that I am but I'm slightly withdrawing sleeping on a fucking couch. I have clonidine and gabapentin prescribed but I pissed through my one month supply in 25 days so i have one week left of 1800 mg a day, shitload of clonidine though but it's not helping the anxiety and rls. On the positive side I just got a crown put in my mouth that throbbing like a motherfucker bit the doctor told me I have a high pain tolerance so we'll see how this second appt goes he said he'll prescribe something for pain but I'm if it's norcos or ibuprofen 800; I take a gram of naproxen as well but I'm :) still throbbing. Sorry for the rant y'all I'm sober but tweaking if you feel me. 

Also if I say fuck it I can pull the granny trash patch kid and take the patch of my dad when they throw it away but that's a whole new low.

When I relapse, I generally go all in but manage to stop after a day or two. This time the Suboxone isn't helping my rls and I'm not sleeping well. Generally it helps 100% when I stuff back. I hate to admit but I havent been doing all that well on Suboxone and have relapsed, I believe, twice this year already and once at the end of last year. 

I'm wondering if the heroin is upping my tolerance and my normal dose is holding me. I don't think it is orwcipated because after I took it I didn't get more sick. 

My question is. Does this happen to you guys when you go back on Suboxone? Is there usually a couple crappy days before in feeling better or did I fuck up my tolerance even worse?

Now though, I have recently acquired a script of hydrocodone 10 mg for pain management of migraines.  I've been taking 10 mg every week or so for the actual pain, but have also been using around 10-15 mg's every 3-10 days (depending on my schedule).  

Of course I'm worried about getting addicted, but I've not really noticed any signs of addiction so far with my regiment.  The only real signal I've noticed is normally on the 4th or 5th day after not dosing, I may get a slight craving that's actually pretty easy to ignore if I want to.  So, for those more experienced, do some people just not get addicted as easily to opiates as others?  Am I just not giving it enough time (a week or so) between doses to actually notice withdrawal symptoms?  Or should I be good to stay on this schedule for the time being with little worry?  Thanks!

None of this information is relevant because you never know what people are going through internally, but this guy literally had the world in his hands. 

I don't want to seem like I'm all high and mighty or out for sympathy because truth be told i wasn't very close to him. I'm more or less worried about my personal friends who were close to him.  I guess I just feel the need to talk about it, because heroin has such a nasty image, but if you saw this guy you would NEVER know.  It hasn't come out yet whether the OD was an accident or if it was done intentionally. He just got out of rehab last Thursday and has been dealing with a serious break up so who knows.

I know this post is unstructured, I'm just blown away by the fact that this guy is gone.  My mom used to abuse pain medication; in high school I would stay with her on the weekends and I recall having to dig pills out of her mouth while she was asleep from the previous pills.

I did 40mg oxy a week ago if that makes any difference in tolerance whatsoever. Keep in mind that these doses are on the heavier side of what I can handle.

I just started Suboxone and I already relapsed, I stopped taking the medication for a few days so that I could use Vicodin.

I started up the Suboxone again but the cravings aren't going away. I am currently taking 8mg twice a day. I don't think suboxone is going to work for me and was thinking that in order to get past this I may have to be on methadone to combat the chemical addiction aspect.

The only problem is I don't know how to go about switching and think that it might be better to give the Suboxone a little more time or go back to my doctor and explain that 16mg a day isn't enough.

Based on the research I have done the methadone replacement therapy seems like a better fit for me personally since I would have some accountability since it requires that I go to the clinic/dr.office every day to get my medication. 

I have already found a private practice in NYC that is close to my intensive outpatient program and they take walk-ins.

The first time I got fentanyl was so scary. It was a tester bag my backup d-boy gave me with my normal pickup, he told me to let him know how the tester bag was. It was some stuff he had gotten off a new plug and he wanted to know how it was before he made the decision to buy an amount to sell or pass on it.
 My girlfriend was driving and I was in the passenger seat. I dumped out the bag on my phone and it resembled crystalesque brown sugar. Which is nothing like the stuff I normally get off my backup dboy which is your typical East Coast powder. I chopped it up and i snorted 2/3 of the bag and she snorted 1/3.
 Within five minutes I knew something was wrong... and another five minutes later everything hit me at once I was so high I thought I was overdosing. I couldn't feel myself breathe my ears were ringing I had tunnel vision I was super dizzy and my heart was pounding out of my chest and I was literally scared for my life and it's getting more and more intense every minute... All the while Im thinking we're going to crash because I assume that my girlfriend is as high as I am while driving...And then the next thing I know I was waking up in the passenger seat of my car parked in a parking lot with some guy knocking on the window and my girlfriend talking to him telling him everything is alright with me. Luckily it was some random fellow dopehead making sure we were okay and not a cop...luckily because she only did one third and I did two thirds it didn't hit her as hard as it did me, but after the whole ordeal she admitted to me that she was worried about her well-being during the episode as well. That was one of the scariest things thats ever happened to me. The shit was deff brown sugar and Fentanyl because the only thing I could taste was brown sugar no dope taste whatsoever.",1521672233.0

Like 3-4 hours ago to be more specific.  I decided I was gonna go cold cop from an area near where I used to live.  The first time I ever used I got it from a homeless guy in this area who asked to borrow my phone.  When I asked what he was getting, he told me and I said I wanted some.  

Anyways, not 3 minutes after getting off the highway into this area, I see a homeless guy with a sign, so I decide to stop and ask him if he know where I can get the hookup.  He told me he doesn't mess with it anymore but there are people around who do.  As we're talking a black dude drives past on the other side of the road.  ""Aye!"" He was tryna see if the homeless guy wanted to cop.  ""Hell yeah, this fast?"" , I thought as I whipped around.  I pull into the CVS the black guy did and ask if he can get any dope.  He had two other dudes in the whip with him.
""What's good bro.  You know where I can find some boy/down etc""
""Nah bro I got that hard""
""Ah fuck.  Can you get down?""
""You don't want none of this bruh?""
""Nah man, my parents were crack addicts when I was younger.  I know h isn't any better, but no reason to add another problem""
""Aight well much do you need?""
""A 40""
""Alright we'll pull over here to the side.  There's cameras and I don't like that shit""
Fair enough, I thought as I followed him past a couple different store fronts until we were on the side of a bank.  I get out and walk up to his window, leaving my car on and behind me.  He gives me his phone number and asks how long I'll wait.  As I'm saying I only have like half an hour until I gotta go, his friend in the back seat gets out of the car.  This didn't really strike me as odd, as much as it should have. 

""You wanna gimme the 40 and have me come back to u with it?""  
""Nah bro I don't let my money walk""  
While I'm still talking to the driver, dude from the backseat got into my car.  I didn't even notice until after he backed out of the parking spot and was already driving forward.  I sprinted full speed and managed to get my fingers wrapped around the door handle as he was driving.  I pull the door open and as soon as I'm looking at him in the face, he smiles and accelerates even more to where I can't do a thing but watch as my car drives away, guaranteeing my fucked situation.  

""Really!?  Did this really just fuckin happen?  FUCK!!! FUCK ME!  I wasn't even supposed to be on this side of town!  My parents are gonna fucking kill me!"" 

I turn around and the other car is gone already...  At this point I'm just super defeated and upset with my stupidity.  Not to mention worried about how my parents will react.  

So I call 911 and inform them my car was stolen.  They arrive, get my story, then are nice enough to Give me a ride down the road a bit to a place I know (after being searched and handcuffed but I didn't have anything on me so I didn't care).  The spot they drop me at is where I first copped dope (behind a bowling alley).  I call my dad and tell him the news.  

""Are you fucking kidding me!?  What are you doing out there anyways?  Visiting Ben?"" (Old friend I've gotten into a lotta trouble with.  Parents knew he was my weed dealer for a while, but he also served me xans and coke at times thru our friendship.  Never dope because he actually is a friend and felt bad)
""No dad, I was coming to meet up with a girl"" (lie but I wasn't there to see ben either and I'm not gonna say why I was there)
""And she coincidentally lives near one of the only places I don't want you to go?""
""Idk what to tell you dad.  I wasn't here to see Ben.""
""Well, your step mom will be there to pick you up.""

While waiting over at the bowling alley, I manage to buy one bag from somebody that looks the part.  They only had that one or I would've gotten more.  

My mom picks me up and we get home.  Almost right after, the cop calls and says we've found your car.  Can you come get it?  Uhhh, fuck yes!  The car was a g37 so it's a push to start.  I had the key still in my pocket when it was stolen, so as soon as he got out of the car or stopped it, he was fucked. He ended up locking himself out and leaving the car on the side of the road (while on I should  say)and as I type this my stepmom is driving me to go get it.  

It was a very shitty experience but I've learned a lot from it and nothing seriously bad happened.  Sorry if this story is kinda choppy and/or sloppy.  I'm on mobile.

So part of having to take a week off work my employer wanted me to take a drug test by today at 4pm.  I had five days to prepare. I have been weaning myself off opiates but could not have went cold turkey to use my own urine. 

A trusted friend of mine who lives across the country told me they had some synthetic urine and they would send it to me. It was supposed to arrive here today. I waited until 2pm and our mail never arrived. So I left to go find some of my own. I saw the mailman around the corner so hopped out and talked to them. They didn’t have my package unfortunately (but did have my roommates mail order Xanax, go figure). 

I ended up calling my mom, as she’s one of the few people left on my side. Told her I was chosen at work for a random drug test and I had just smoked marijuana last weekend and needed the funds for urine. She was cool with this and let me borrow money and use her microwave to heat it up in. I heated it up, attached the heating pad, threw it in my pants and went straight to the testing facilities. 

The woman that worked there was a no nonsense type woman.  I had to take off my jackets and that was it. She told me I had 4 minutes and not to flush. I poured the contents of my bottle into their cup. Noticed their cup read “temp=green” and took that as that little circle had to be green for them to accept it. After pouring my synthetic urine in there the circle was red. With maybe 3 minutes left I held my heating pad up to their cup and the circle went from red > green > blue FAST. I took the heating evidence leftover and put it in my pants, waited for that circle to turn green, and as soon as it did opened the door and handed it to the lady. She immediately looked at the temperature circle and accepted it. Signed my papers and walked out the door. 

I’m 98% certain I passed. Won’t find out until next week.  Now to move on to getting clean and cleaning up the rest of my life. I read all of your comments from the last post. Thank you for all the support and tough love. I needed it. 

I’ll probably post another update later this weekend or next week. Peace love & nods ya’ll.

Then, one day, someone maybe your sister, your brother, your friend, or maybe even your parents hand you a new mask and say 'Hey, try this on.'

Reluctant at first, you finally grab the mask and fit it over your face. Suddenly your perception changes and you don't know what it is, but you instantly fall in love. ""Damn this is cool! I could get used to this."" But no mind is payed to the first time wearing the mask.

One morning down the line, you wake up, go to the mirror, and realize the mask is tied to your face with a couple rogue stitches. Jumping back startled, you rip the mask off leaving a couple small gashes on your face. This scares you and you shove the mask in your closet to collect dust. But, as time passes, you start to dust it off and within no time, you're wearing the mask.

Now you've been very casually wearing this mask around pretty consistently. One morning you wake up, look in the mirror and your stomach drops. Stitches on over half the mask are now embedded in your face. You panic, struggle to rip the mask off, and succeed, leaving your face pained and bloody.

Be that as it may, even after the scars on your face heal, you continue to wear the mask. Soon, day in and day out. Then one morning you wake up, look in the mirror, and you can't see your own face anymore. 

You struggle and try to rip that mask off you first encountered years ago, but to your surprise, there are no stitches holding the mask to your face. Stepping back and realizing with horror, that it become a part of you, far past the point of separation. Unable to recognize your own face.

So you sit huddled in a corner, wondering if it will ever end. Wondering when it all became so complicated.",1521661504.0

I've been an opiate addict for, well, awhile. Started off with Hydros and Oxycodone when I was 15, ended up on Heroin approximately two years ago, and recently I crossed that bridge so many of us cross, and started IVing. I was on a clean streak of about 8 months when I got out of jail for my first ever offense and met the love of my life. Her name also starts with an H. So H and I were a dream team, and my God it hurts so fucking bad to even think about her, after everything that's happened.

So H and I met at a place we both worked at about a year ago. We hit it off, I mean we just clicked. I've been through my share of relationships, I'm not a fool. It was destiny that we met. Before long we were infatuated with one another, and dating, and a few months later living together. H had a previous drug problem as well. We just got each other.. man the fucking tears I just can't stop.. we began using together about once a week last August. Things were going great for the first and I mean FIRST time in my life, we had plenty of money, a nice place to live, good jobs, everything. However I should have known, the wild dreams and omens, where I would wake up in night terrors calling out H's name, to find her next to me, to comfort me. I woke up after sleeping from work at 7 p.m on November 9th to the worst disaster of my life.. I tried to wake H up to pick up her kids and she wouldn't respond.. I tried so hard and she wouldn't wake up.. my poor baby. I can still see myself weeping as the paramedics arrived, trying so hard to revive her.. the futility of it all. We'd done a little bit of a 30 of some dope that I had saved and I'd gone to bed, when I woke up the pack was lying next to the bed, and my sweetheart was gone.. just gone. I still can't process it.

I drive by her old house almost every time I pick up, it kills me inside. I want to join her so bad but I don't. Perhaps for my father who is the only person alive that loves me, perhaps for this story to get shared on Reddit. I don't know anymore, she was my purpose.. I've considered posting this story multiple times. I just didn't know what to say. Heather Lou, if you can read this somehow, know that I love you, more than anything.. I can't stop loving you and I can't stop crying, and I don't know if I can stop using. I know I need to for you baby, but I just want the pain to end. I just want to be with you again.",1521657329.0

Moved to a different part of the country, no health insurance to go to the dr, don't know anyone etc, so I have to rely solely on kratom. 

I have day's where my shoulder pain in unbearable, but there's nothing I can do about it. For milder pain days, a good dose of red kratom will usually take the edge of, but it's often not enough.

My substance abuse journey began at 13 with ecstasy, and culminated at 30 with a 600mg per day Oxy habit. 

It took my losing the majority of my friends and a (very) promising career in tech to sober up, but I'm 33 now and I've been clean for a little over a year.

At this point I'm not sure what to do... I don't have the $$$ to finance a professional degree (and tbh I'm kinda too old) and my career in tech is toast. I'm a salesman by trade and I'm not sure I can do that kind of work again without relapsing...

Any suggestions?",1521654212.0

I certainly enjoy opiates, but I am really asking in regard to MDMA. I hope that's fly

If you don't want the synopsis, why questions are:

How should I ensure my bowels are clear around 11PM at a festival? I have no experience with taking a laxative, so I don't want something that is too variable and might have me shitting my brains out in the middle of a show, and leave me clogged up by nighttime.

Do any of you have experience or advice for plugging at festivals?
Is is possible in a portapotty, or should I head back and do it at camp?
Should I prepare the syringe and find a way to cap it, or should I prepare it right before I plug?

___
So, I can't keep MDMA down and therefore cannot have a full roll. It's been a few years of trying different methods, fighting it with everything I have, taking smaller doses, taking supplements like zofran, but I have come to terms with the fact that I cannot ingest it without vomiting the MDMA back up and cutting off roll at the come up. It sucks.

So I think plugging is my only option, save for maybe injecting it. But if that were even possible I think that would be too quick and prone to redosing, which I why I don't snort it. I tried plugging for my last roll 6 months ago, but it failed because I still had feces up  there I couldn't pass (due to my crappy diet and infrequent shitting habits, both of which I have since changed so maybe that will be all that it takes). So that absorbed the MDMA was ineffective.

I am going to Bonnaroo (shouts out!) and will try it again, now that I have a high fiber diet and shit at least once a day. But when I shit I still usually feel like I don't pass it all, so I am looking for a way to make sure it isn't an issue. It could just be a matter of eating a lot of fiber in the afternoon so that I am clear by 11PM. So if anyone has any experience with clearing out there bowels, which I don't really, and how that might work at a festival, please share!

And generally, do any of you have experience or advice for plugging at festivals? Will I have to walk back and do it at my campsite, or could a do it in a portapotty with one leg hiked up? Should I bring the syringe and Molly and mix it inside the center of the festival, or pre-prepare it and find a way to cap the hole?",1521650906.0

Second the percocet doesn't ""back me up"" I go everyday, does that indicate that I might not have the diarrhea? And last I do have the DLPA to help with cravings, those I get a lot, I don't have a blood pressure problem, but I've read that coming off opiates can raise your pressure and that DLPA can also, I can't find just the DPA so I'm stuck with the DLPA. This is the only issue keeping me from stopping completely. How common is a raise in blood pressure with the DLPA? All together I have ativan, zofran (nausea and vomiting), b6, a multi vitamin, vitamin c, DLPA, prozac, seroquel  (which I've read your not supposed to mix with the DLPA so I might go a couple days without it) I'm going to be getting the L-tyrosine.

So needless to say I never really liked it. The last time I tried it was probably like 6 months ago. 

I looked around this sub a little and the general consensus seems to be that Tramadol sucks, but whatever, I have it and I’d like to try it. 

So with my relative lack of tolerance what would you recommend? Would 100mg do the trick do you think? I have some .5mg kpins to go along with it.

So my dboy is a fellow pill head like me who just helps me get 30s because we both like to do them but he's not a opiate dealer. He does have seriously dank live resin and the best bud around and usually always shrooms on deck so I go for that usually lol. Anyways I digress.

1:00 PM yesterday, I get a call on my day off from my dboy and he's basically in tears because he woke up to an eviction notice to the apartment he moved into about 7 months ago. The reason he had to move into that apartmemt is because both his parents sadly passed away within one month of eachother last year, leaving him to sell his childhood house. 

I tell him ima come over right away to kick it and just keep him company and help out start packing his apartment/set up his upcoming grow op. Get there between 1 30 and 2, walk in, and he's seriously bummed. But not to the point of giving up on life, just seriously bummed. We spent the next 7 to 8 hours bullshitting, trying to forget the news, smoking, and he went through a sprite bottle of lean and five 30s and a bar and a half to himself in that time. He was hurting bad so all I wanted to do was make sure I could just be a friend as he needed someone to vent to and also make sure he was safe.

At this point its around 10 PM, and I've been up for nearly 36 hours because I used meth and I hadn't in a long time and had dosed the day before. I wanted to start to head home so I agreed to help him with one last task of driving some marijuana clones to the grow op around 15 minutes from his house. But as you can probably imagine, the nods he was having at this point were heavy because of the lean oxy and Xanax and it slowed the process from 10pm till 12am start time. 

Oh also as we were driving his car to the grow spot, his car died. So he got evicted and his car died in the same day. Anyways, my point is it was a long ass motherfucking day, pretty sure dboy fell asleep on me while I'm waiting on him to show up for breakfast. Fucking oh well. 4 and a half 30s, gas money, gram of live resin, a quad of bud and 2 bars is definitely worth it ",1521629742.0

Reflecting on what I could have done. 

Now, I personally would like to share this story because I feel like no one else in the world understands. 

I have never done heroin, but do pills, but know nothing about heroin. My friend invited me to do heroin with him but I declined. I still went with him to pick it up and chill though. I was driving and he hops back in the car after seeing his dboy and holds up a bag of white crystals and says ""haha, China white motherfucker!"" BOOM. If I had known anything about heroin, I would have known it wasn't heroin and was in fact fentanyl. He doesn't want to wait until we got back to his house to bang it so he cooks it up in the car (stupid, I know, but we were in the middle of nowhere far from civilization). Before he shoots he jokes with me that if anything happens throw everything out and drive him to the hospital instead of calling 911 because we were so far out I'd get there faster (again, stupid). He shoots it and immediately has a reaction I have never seen from him or anyone. He moaned a bit and his head hit his chest. I laughed and was like ""haha come on buddy you a little fucked up?"" Then I hear it. The death gurgle. I say his name and then begin speeding and repeating his name louder and louder. I slapped him and hit him. I began sobbing. I felt for his pulse. Nothing. I go into autopilot and scream still while crying and speeding into town to the hospital. Literally as soon as I whip into the parking lot his head pops up and he starts screaming. He held himself and said ""that wasn't heroin"" over and over. He tried to get out of the car and fell on his face. I run over and put his head in my lap. I ask him what he wants me to do or what he wants to do and he just starts crying and sobers up and says ""no please don't go get them they'll label me a drug user for life it'll ruin me please"" so I get him back in the car and we head to his house (stupid) and he goes back to normal. So, turns out, what I had thrown out was a full prescription bottle of suboxone and that baggie of fent. He became angry and said I stole from him. I was to traumatized by what had just happen I couldn't understand his anger. I left and slammed the door. Later I text him and offered to pay to replace the suboxone. He came to my work (chill place) the next day to get the money and said after what happened he was getting sober again. We hugged and parted ways. I get off work and am in bed scrolling through Facebook when I see a post to his page, and RIP post. My heart fell out of my chest. He used that money for more fent. I feel responsible. I haven't gotten over it in almost the year that it's happened. He died alone in his basement. And I blame myself. If I had known more about drugs, if I had gotten him some kind of help, if my state sold narcan, fuck. ",1521602390.0

So i was visiting my parents in california for the summer and picked up what i thought was heroin (not the black tar stuff usually found in cali but the brown powder stuff you find around england, where i live.). i was smoking it off a foil alone when i start to have a lot of trouble breathing. i initially thought i was just nodding really hard but i could tell it was different from h because there was no euphoria, just straight to passing out.

i can barley breathe at this point and start hawking up really fat loogies. the loogies get bigger and bigger and start turning pink, and then to red until i realise that im coughing up straight blood.

my mom arrives home at this point and hears me coughing (apparantly, i actually dont remember anything after this), and according to her i was barley conscious, and mumbling incoherently, while coughing up a fuckton of blood.

ended up staying in the icu hooked up to an oxygen machine for the next few days, docs said if my mom found me ten min later i wouldve been a goner :/

this wasnt a traditional OD in the way that people usually die from opiates, but i think this shit mustve been cut with something my lungs really didnt agree with, apparently my alveoli were shredded and i was drowning in my blood. has anything like this ever happened to anyone?? ",1521593656.0

Immediately after doing one bag (I smoke it) I started to lose my vision and my hearing became extremely muffled. Everything in my line of sight sort of lightened out to whiteness and every sense I had was distorted it felt absolutely awful. It took about ten minutes but I slowly returned to somewhat normal and now I have a pounding headache with absolute fear about doing the rest of my stuff,

The supply of Oxy in my area has diminished quite a bit. About a month ago I found a connect who has Morphine 30s and 60s for a very solid price. 

Anyway, I’ve been plugging 120mg between morning and mid-afternoon and then a few additional smaller Mg plugs throughout the day, or another bigger Mg plug in the evening. Although the high doesn’t provide as much of a “euphoric rush” or uplifting feeling, I’ve grown to really enjoy. It’s very mellow and relaxing, more subtle but just as enjoyable for me. 

Not to mention lasts WAY longer, and the sickness comes way later for me. I can plug 120mg Morph at 10pm the night before and be good all day the next day until evening. Where as Oxy, if I sniffed 60mg at 10pm, I’d be feeling kinda shitty by noon the next day. Call me crazy, but for the price, duration of the high, and it keeping me well so much longer, I’m starting to enjoy Morphine almost as much, if not more than Oxycodone. 

(Please keep in mind I DO NOT use needles, and never will. Only plug my morph)

I love it. The thought that I have to be very sneaky and watch my back. It's always so great. Back when I used to do pills before I graduated to just snorting heroin at my desk, I would get my pills out, usually 2 or 3 oxys, sometimes vics if that's all I could find, to take orally and sometimes I'd take them out and I'd hear someone coming so I would push the pills behind the monitor where no one could see.

On multiple occasions, I forgot that I had placed the pills behind the computer, already being high, I just forgot I guess a couple times and would reach into my purse for more. Now, this was actually a blessing believe it or not... sounds more like a nightmare, I know.

But apparently the night clean up crew here are not junkies. Because on multiple Mondays (cleaning crew only comes Friday evenings) I would come into work in the morning and see, every so neatly placed on my drink coaster, whatever pills I left behind the monitor. I also would sometimes during the week, just happen to look behind the monitor, seeing the pills and being ecstatic because I forgot about them. 

Now; leaving those pills out taught me 2 things. 

1) BE MORE CAREFUL AND STOP PUTTING PILLS BEHIND YOUR MONITOR

and 2) no one here gives a shit what I actually do.... because one day someone was using my desk on a Monday morning after the cleaning crew had put my pills on my coaster... I came in and someone was at my desk. Surely she did not miss these two bright yellow vicodin. She welcomed me back from the weekend, and went back to her own seat without seeming strange or like she knew anything, but surely she had to have seen them, the coaster is about 5 inches from my computer mouse so when she looked to sit at my desk she has to have seen them right away and just, no one cares which is fine with me.

In the height of my addiction I was banging💉 10 roxy 30 mg's a day. Good times!! I'm a army combat veteran and opiates really helped my pain and helped me manage PTSD. Eventually I had to quit because I thought I had a problem. Looking back my problem was I couldn't afford my habit, It was too expensive!😬 I also felt a lot of guilt because of the stigma from society about opiates. I've been clean for three years. I chip maybe three times a year. And yes I consider that being clean. Idgaf if judgmental people disagree. Anyways, I've been getting a strong itch to use and I finally gave in today (hence this long post, lol). Before I called my old dboy, I went on a mission to buy pins. It took about four hours to find a pharmacy that would sell me pins. So frustrating!!  My heart really goes out to people who are are using frequently and don't have access to clean needles. The way we treat ""the least of thee"" is atrocious. Boo Florida!! No needle exchange and no sell pharmacy needle policy is so backwards. I guess the state thinks addicts and users shouldn't have the right to minimize their harm. What a public health nightmare!! Rant over. 😊 Does anyone know of needle exchange non profits in Florida?

I know that's not a huge habit, but it's still a habit. I used to cop smaller amounts (3 pills) and let myself run out between scores, then the break between each score got smaller and smaller, then I started copping larger amounts (5 pills, then 10). Most recently, I blasted through about 20 pills in about 14 days. I decided that was more than I wanted to be doing, and decided to let myself detox and take some time before using again. I took 1mg subs the first day, 1/2 mg subs the next, and then only kratom and small doses of loperamide for four days. I'm on my seventh day of no oxy, and I have zero physical withdrawal symptoms, but it's like suddenly all this shit is going wrong in my life. My relationship is shitty, my friendships are deteriorating, and my lease is almost up. I honestly don't know if it's actually gotten worse, or if I was just ignoring how bad it was before because I could get high instead. None of them know I use. What's worse is a couple days ago I committed to my biggest score yet (25 pills) that'll be in tonight, because I was told that was my only option until early next week and I couldn't wait that long. Now I'm questioning the role oxy is playing in my problems, and I'm not sure if I need to commit to staying clean to work through the issues in my life, or if I can work through them while I use. I'm not even sure that I can commit to not using if I have that score at home. Plenty of times I've told myself ""not today"" but it never works; if I have pills, it's almost like I can't not take them. What should I do?

Work is hard right now because I need to shit every 45 minutes.

Anyway, what’s a suitable amount of time to detox before you can consider to start over? Obviously 3 weeks of sobriety wasn’t enough. The weekend usage from there didn’t cause dependency, and I was completely healthy on the weekdays. It was the week long DHC binge that did it, but I wonder I detoxed for longer the addiction wouldn’t have come back so quick. Those 3 weeks lowered my tolerance to about half of what it was when I stopped, but after the binge it went way up to new heights.

86aoul,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/86aoul/a_preview_to_an_arduous_scenario_that_started_on/,14,https://redd.it/86aoul,sloan_fitch,A preview to an arduous scenario that started on a snowy morning,"It's 10AM on a weekday and I hear someone talking outside. Figured someone was shoveling with a friend until my phone chimed a message from Clifford.

&nbsp; 


Cliff's messages starting just after 9AM..

9:08 AM: Yo it's an emergency are you alive[.]

9:12 AM: I'm at your door and please answer dude[.]

9:15 AM: I see ur pops is home again 2day. I didn't call house or ring bell. I just want u to open up[.]

9:23 AM: I'm still by door plz open it. it aint nice out here.

9:36 AM: Can u open door. u gotta be up for work""[.]

9:46 AM: Are u alive man ?

&nbsp;

Next, my first response of the morning. Note, I was only cogniscent of the situation as of five minutes earlier. In fact, I didnt' realize he was outside my door sending messages for the entire hour prior to 10am until just. I didn't see the messages that were sent before 10AM until 16 hours later when I started writing this.

&nbsp;

**Me/Sloan, my first responses:**


10:13 AM: I'm sorry I passed out early had to be in work before 11am.


**BTW, it is around this time I first checked my front door surveillance camera to determine that Cliff was standing out there and confirmed that he was there for quite a few minutes prior. Just pacing in my driveway, standing on my doorstep, and periodically checking his phone.**

&nbsp;

Cliff goes on:


10:14 AM: I'm at ur door please answer. I been here 2 hours I know u didn't leave.



Me..
10:15 AM: I'll call you when I get there (work) what do u mean I didn't leave? 


Note, at this poing I'm just struggling to BS him that I'm not home but it's not wokring. I'm just flabbergasted that he's just been there and isn't going away. The night before I hung out at another friend's house. when I finally got home I didn't go to Cliff to hang out and talk. I didn't see the point because he wasn't doign me any favors, in fact he was a couple of days delayed in following through on getting subs..             


**But anyway** (yeah I know you're not supposed to start sentences with ""but""), before bed the night before I text real late and said ""I got work early tomorrow, I'm passing in a couple of minutes.""

Cliff asked me to pick up my phone, to talk for *just* 30 seocnds. I didn't answer. I figured he was gonna ask me to do something I didn't want to do. Then if I said no he would re-package the proposition since he couldn't take no for an answer.

Repackaging a proposition, how? You'll see in a moment. Basically whne I Say no, **he'll say anything** to get me to say yes. Sort of like that time last July when I had half a bun left and he had none. He texted me in that afternoon asking if  Ihad a bump, that he'd pay me back extra on monday... then I aske dabout he subs and he said he was checking. Then he said there was a good chance I could go pick the subs up, less likely that thgey'll get delivered.


That past time it was one of his imaginary friends with subs. Those imaginary friends used to prove indispensible to get me spending more.


&nbsp;

Anyway, Cliff didn't believe my lie when I said I was already on my way to work. 

Cliff continues:
10:16 AM: I'm at ur front door dude

10:19 AM Can u open door

&nbsp;

Me..
10:22 AM: What u mean I didn't leave yet? 
(still struggling to make him go away by convincing him I'm not home)



Cliff..
10:24 AM: Ur home. Can u answer door[?]


Me..
10:26 AM: I don't get why you're trying to get me to do sometihng this goddamn early. I want to be left alone this early.

(Honestly, it's a fucking cardinal rule not to ring my door bell or call me to physically do anything before 11AM with advaned notice and agreement)


10:26 AM: You wont even text me why


&nbsp;

Cliff goes on..

10:26 AM: Please just answer dude

10:27 AM: My phone is going to die !


(BTW my good pal Tim always used to use that one, when he was calling doctors to try to shop for blue he would tell the receptionsist that his phone was about to die so that they'd be more likely to answer his query or put a doctor on the phone. He did it a number of times when his phone was not low. I believe Cliff appleid this stratagy.)

&nbsp;

I, Sloan continues...

10:27 AM: Like maybe I wanna take a leaisurely shit.

(it is a crucial part of my mornign routine)

10:27 AM: And get back to you when I'm en route to work or something.

10:28 AM: And maybe I'm afraid to talk on the phone (last night) because I don't want to commit to anything early or by accident. (same applies now)


&nbsp;

Cliff, starts to give us some gold...

10:28 AM: I'm frozen just open plz


(oh, he's frozen.... I wonder who's idea it was to stand in my driveway for an entire fucking 90 minutes!)


10:35 AM: If u aint leauin open dooq plz

10:36 AM: U Cant anser door ? I'm so cold plz

(once again, who's fault is it that he's so cold?

&nbsp;

Then I elaborate why I ain't coming to th door because I fucking gave up on trying to convince him I'm not home; thus I go on to respond.


Me/Sloan....

10:48 AM: You're gonna sk me to do something before work, right? That's why you won't text me why you're waiting.

10:49 AM: No I wear. Just open.

&nbsp;


I tip-toed to my kitchen, walked past my front door and started making coffe. Spent a good ten minutes in my kitchen quietly preparing, watching my surveillance camera and drinking coffee.

Cliff probably thinks I'm committing some kind of betrayal by not wanting to help him buy dope. He may only suspect that I've taken my business elsewhere but it is evident to him that his days of getting my money are rapidly coming to an end. Just as last week, he owed me half a bun and was willing to credit me another full bun. I declined because I did not want to owe him anything a week later. Even if I were to just owe him a single bun, I know he wouldn't let me buy one bun for him and call it a day. Hell, I didn't owe him anything and he still came knocking.


&nbsp;

So last week as far as Cliff was concerned, that was my last hurrah. I even used that phrase in a sentence and it appeared to have landed on his deaf ears since he didn't acknowledge the statement. Nonetheless, I've said it a dozen different ways and he knew damn well that I wasn't buying dope with him this week. I had my reasons, some relating to certifications and career. Of course I have other rasons, but by screwing me over Cliff fucked with my money for certifications as well my own happiness.


&nbsp;


As stated in the [first part of this particular tale](https://redd.it/86aoul) in the greater Cliff saga, it all started on snowy morning. As evidenced by my front door surveillance camera, he loitered at my door for nearly two hours. For the first hour I was simply asleep. Then upon hearing a text message chime, I checked my phone and it was Cliff asking me to come to my door. I tried to pretend that I was not home, that I was at work.


I knew his emergency was simply that he wanted ask me to do something before I left for work. I thought he wanted me to physically do something like pick up his mom's script but it wasn't script day. Before I bothered to come to my door I texted ""ovbiously you want me to do somethig that I don't want to do before work."" Cliff denied and tried assuring me that this was not the case. 


&nbsp;

He kept texting and asking me to open my door. That it was cold outside. I still can't believe he used that statement, I didn't tell him to come to my house in the snow before I woke up. Eventually I let him in after my first cup off coffee.


I was clear that I did not appreciate his presence but I heard him out. He asked if I was buying dope this week. I told him and confirmed that nothing has changed since last week. That I was not planning on buying dope this week. He then tried convincing me saying ""just one last hurrah, please."" As I ate my breakfast I told him that his presence was giving me indigestion, that I didn't want to do it but after his annoying persistence I told him I would seriously consider it. Just to go and leave. That I would drop my debit card off on my way to work.

&nbsp;

Cliff confirmed that he placed hte order and I started having second thoughts. I didn't like how bugged me in the morning before work to get me to do something I didn't want to do. I told him that he should cancel the order, that he would cancel the order if he respected my wishes.


Cliff whinedd in text, ""Dude, don't do this to me please"", ""I have them already coming with order for 1pm.""

I was willing to just let this go, but had I known what plan Cliff had in store for me this would've gone differently. For some stupid reason I trsued that this would go just as it has in the past. As long as I Was clear in the begining of what I expected and wanted, nothing would go drastically wrong.

I was dead wrong. It is my own damn fault for allowing myself to be put into a position to be taken advantage of. This proved to be on the of the most blatant violations of my trust.


&nbsp;

The other caveat, since I had to leave for work (and secretly to see Tim for dope before work), I had to hand Cliff my debit card to take out an agreed upon amount. $200, he'd get 3 buns, 2 for him and 1 for me. Then come Tuesday he would pay me back. He assured me that he'll give me money on Tuesday but I know he wont have money because he has to sell the pills he's getting.


So in all liklihood he's not paying me back in cash but in pills. There's also a possibility that he won't pay me back in full. Which is good in away because I'll just tell Cliff that I'm not fixing the power cord for the MacBook I sold him. It would've kept working if he didn't do such a shitty job of taking care of his shit.


BTW I just spoke to him and he said that he's selling the pills right after he gets the script. So sure enough, he won't have the money right away because it'll take a while. I'm formulating some ideas.

&nbsp;

Speaking of the MacBook, he rarely pays his debts in full. I basically sold him an old MacBook for $200 or three buns of dope. After he gave me the first two buns of dope, I thought I'd never get the third one. Then his power cord malfunctioned because I provided a faulty one in case he didn't pay me back in full. Then suddenly Cliff cared about paying me third bun if I managed to fix the broken power cord.


After a few weeks he broke wore the repaired power cord, destroyed my special structural modifications through his carelessness. In recent weeks he wants it fixed and he keeps bragging that he paid the cost in full.


The one time Cliff paid his debt for something, he milks the bragging rights. It's quite hilarious, annoying and pathetic. 


&nbsp;

Bottom line. Cliff waited outside my door for nearly two hours in the snow. When I finally let him in he wouldn't leave until I vouched some kind of commitment. I only did it because he promised me that I'd get my money back on Tuesday even tohugh he probably was just saying whatever I wanted to hear. There was some truth to it but I know if I count on money this Tuesday I'll just be met with waiting. So it's best that I take my payment in script form and as soon as it's available. From there I can use, trade or flip it for cash.


If Cliff asks me to go to the ATM with his ATM crd during the week I might also take my money back that way but I'd imagine that Cliff wold come knocking on my door once he reailized it. If he was willing to persistently wait on a cold day when nothing was owed, just imagine how he would act if he felt like he was owed something.

&nbsp;


To this point, I only spoke about the $200 that he was authorized to take from the ATM toward dope. Two minutes after that transaction another $100 was taken out. I noticed it, texted him and he denied having an idea. I thought I mis-read it then I checked my bank records at work and realized it did happen.


Upon calling Cliff on the phone he denied it, I checked the details and told him that it did happen. I said, ""you are the last person to use my debit card, just tell me now if you accidentally took the extra money out or sometihng."" He had it last, it stands to be reasoned that nobody else took the $100. 


&nbsp;

Since Cliff denied that he was the one who performed the extra $100 transaction, I said ""this is bullshit and it's impossible for me to find out..."" I then asked Cliff to explain his solution, he suggested that the gas station could check the surveillance video and show it to me. I immediately called bullshit, the gas station has no obligation to show me footage. That just made no sense.


Then I texted Cliff and told him I spoke to the Gas Station corporate hotline and lied. I said that they told me ""a police report is required in order to pull surveillance footage."" I told Cliff that I would be going to the precinct to submit a police report after work. This of course helpted changed Cliff's tune.

&nbsp;

Then Cliff tried to blame his middle, Derrick, for taking it. So he said that Derrick was out shoveling snow for money and that he'd come by in alittle bit.


Cliff said he wanted to look into Derrick's eyes to see if he was lying on the phone about not taking my money.
Around 7PM Cliff claims he spoke to Derrick. That Derrick claimed he misintepreted Cliff's words. 


&nbsp;


When I got off work I spoke to Cliff and the shit he told me on the phone while at work evolved a bit. You see, he claims that him and Derrick went to the ATM together and that he left my card in the machine. Since Derrick thought Cliff wanted to spend $300, not $200, he took it upon himself to take out $100 more. Now, Cliff did nonly get 3 buns total as far as he told me... so he claimed Derrick didn't say it at the time but that when reminded he would be bringing the rest of the order of dope later that night.


Cliff promised me that he would make this right. That if Derrick didn't take care of it that night he would go to Derrick's house in the morning. Around 3AM I spoke to Derrick on the phone and confirmed that he was not in fact dropping anytihng off to Cliff.


&nbsp;

Sure enough, the next day Cliff said that Derrick was picking up an order now and would deliver it before I had to leave for work at 2pm. I really had work at 3pm which gained me an extra hour when the delivery didn't show up.



""I'm hoping by the time you get here I'll be able to hand u what is owed. I'm getting update now I HATE dboys."" Cliff never used the term dboy until I started using it and I got it from this subreddit. Before work he also said ""Derrick just called me he's on his way to go pick up.""

&nbsp;

When I told him I'm departing soon he said ""I need ur help come quicker"", I said no because I'm not gonna rush through my shower. I'm not dirty like him. Well, I didn't say the last part but seriously why would and why should I rush for someone who already fucked me over?



Subsequently he said he took care of it and that we're now good. So I go, oh ""dd the eagle land?"" 

Cliff sates, first, ""nah not yet I'll explain later"". Then after I'm at work, ""I'm just waitin for drop off, he got it"", in response to a request for a status update.

This was around 4pm. 

&nbsp;

Around 5pm I ask, ""so he's got it but stll not back"". Cliff confirms, ""Correct, I'm epxecting him very soon."" Closer to 6 I rant that it's still not there and he says again, ""he's en route to me.""


Around 7 I say, ""is he on the way back from China?"" Cliff responds, ""No he's with his scrap metal boss dirvin back probably trinhg to ake bread. By the time you get out of work I'll have ur shit.""



&nbsp;

Upon another grumpy status update Cliff says ""I'm literally waiting now dude."" Just continued assurances it'll be here by the time I get ot of work and confirmatio of when I leave work. 



90 minutes later I get an ETA of 30 minutes. More ocmplaints from me and Cliff says, ""I'm literally sittin here waitin. I'm going to take a walk jsut to see."" Bullshit, Cliff doesn't walk unless it's a sure thing.


&nbsp;


Finally he stops responding to my messages after work. My worst nightmares come true as a result of my coerced choice to help him out. I texted that I knew he's lying but that I don't care as long as I get my money back.


Cliff didn't acknowledge that he's a lying scumbag but he did say he was sleeping.


Via text, I just confirmed when he gets his script on Tuesday that I'm getting pills or or money. He says he's going to sell the pills instantly but I doubt it. I'm not going to not take pills when he has them and wait a day or two for money that never shows up. If Cliff has a choice of selling pills and ordering dinner or paying his debt.. his fat ass will order dinner.


&nbsp;

So maybe I'll use the pills, maybe I'll flip them but I'm more likely to get pills as opposed to cold hard cash. Maybe if I'm lucky I'll get some cash but I doubt I'll get more than $40, the majority of the debt will be paid in pills because Cliff uses his script as currency.


&nbsp;

If I decline the pills on Tuesday and demand money, there is a higher likliehood that I'll receive neither. 


This Tuesday I am waking up early in preparation to pick up Cliff's script. It will be pre-arranged the night before. If it isn't or if he doesn't answer my phone on Tuesay, I will do what he did to me this past week. I shall go to his house early and wait at his door, blow up his phone, and knock.


Hell, I have the key to his house since I sometimes walk his dog in emergencies. I'll grant myself entry as a last resort..


&nbsp;

So hopfully on Monday, I pick up his script, get some pills and later that day get money. I tihnk I'll take the entire debt in pill form. If he succeeds in selling pills, I'll just trade back my pills for cash. If he doesn't, then at least I'll have something.


Regardless of what happens this Tuesday, Cliff can and will be told to eat a bag of dicks. I'm only being cordial now to ensure that I can recoup at least some of my loss this coming week. 


&nbsp;

**I'm sorry that this post is a big step backwards.** It's like I didn't learn or listen to any of my past lessons. I just didn't think Cliff had the audacity to engage in this type of heist. I might pretend to want the pills really badly so that Cliff thinks I'm sitll in the game but my goal is simple. To recoup as much of my loss as possible by any means possible.


I suspect part of the reason he did this was because he knew this would probably be the last time I'm buying/loaning him dope and the last time I'm letting him use my card. Since it's the last time, there would be no consequence in violating my trust.


&nbsp;

I don't know if he screwed me because he could, he knew he could take advantage of the situation for the sake of his own benefit. Maybe he did it for that reason and to spite me after having to wait outside my houes for two hours. I'm sure inside his head he somehow justified his own actions.

&nbsp;


Seriously, I vow to never do aynthing for Cliff again. Once I recoup a portion or the entirety of my loss this Tuesday, I'm gonna use this incident as an example and excuse if and when Cliff begs for my asssistance in the future.


If he asks me for a favor, ""hell no buddy, I don't want to get fucked over again like you did to me two weeks ago."" Maybe I'll say, ""I'm not doing this, I don't appreciate what you did last week."" When he denies, and he will deny wrongdoing, I'll say, ""I'm not arguing semantics."" He knows he's full of shit and doesn't need me to explain it and I'm not giong to expend energy arguing such a self evident thesis.

It’s literally like the waiting room in that Eminem music video, I think it was „The Real Slim Shady“ back then. Some dude is kicking up a major fuss because he got kicked out of detox for smoking K2 or some other synthetic cannabinoid shit. Keep in mind he was on 130 fucking mgs, was checked into detox for abusing benzos by the MDone doc, and will now be given the boot without tapering down. On 130 fucking milligrams of MDone and with a sizeable benzo habit, all over shitty Spice. The police are called to subdue him since he’s barred out on wonky Chinese Xan presses. Some lady is missing several teeth and is actually storing € bills into her bra as opposed to her wallet. There’s exactly one person in the entire waiting room who isn’t sweating profusely. An obviously withdrawing mother is seated with her kid which heartbreakingly asks „Are these people sick like you mommy?“. The receptionist is enlightening a new patient as to the intricacies of stool samples. Never a dull moment here.
Blatant shitpost, but I just thought I oughtta tell you guys how MDone works here in Germany. This is a very US-centric subreddit but in the past people were very interested about the dope game over here. Thank God for socialized Yuropeen healthcare, this shit might literally save my life. 50mg of MDone doesn’t get me high per se, but I feel that opiate-induced contentness you feel after the initial rush from your shot has worn off.

so, we all have moments when thoughts enter our minds that aren't entirely rational from a normal human beings pov. But I hope you understand my train of thought. 




I'm out of coke and money, but would like to substitute for speedballs. My roommate has some speed in the fridge and since I don't know where to come by meth (not really a thing where I live) to do a goofball, I thought I'd try to shoot a liiiiil bit of speed with my next dope shot. 




Any experiences? It's possible I just won't do it as I don't really like speed (anymore tbh lol) when snorted or ingested. But knowing it's there just got me thinking. 





I'd be interested in how long the speed high would last when iv'd, how bad coming down from it is and how the rush compares to coke. All in combination with heroin, mixed in the same shot. 




Hope everyone is well out there!



Edit: just checked the fridge and it's gone, damn it. :( He must've taken it with him to party. But that means it should be there again tomorrow. His gf doesn't like drugs and she's with him.

This is the first time I have ever had tar. First of all I was told this was #4 Heroin that's it and that's all I know. 

When I got it, it reeked of vinegar through the bag and even the drawer its in reeks right now (have .45 left).

So yea I was just kinda hoping to see some old heads here and talk with this awesome community here at r/Opiates about the quality on this, does it look like GOOD tar to you or does this look like some cut to shit shit?

Again, I ask because I have only seen tar on here. The consistency of it is dry, shiny, and with some heat tiny particles will stick to the baggy a TINY bit (miniscule) but then it dries back up and it comes right out of the bag, its rocky but crushed.

Falling hard?,"So I've been using for about 2 1/2 years now, but have always stuck to one super bitch of a dgirl up until about November of last year. Then I was amazed to find a reliable, respectful guy with better prices AND higher quality ECP. He is extremely good looking and has a ripped bod to boot. (JACKPOT YAY ME)

Anyway, the usually all-but-certain question to be asked of any decent looking female junkie by a male dealer was asked of me. He wanted to know if I would ""spend some time'' with him for free product. Although this goes against every moral on that fucked up compass most of us have (or had, some time long ago), it didn't take long before I gave in. And to be fair, I would have wanted dat ass anyway ;)

I half expected the chivalry/respect to all but cease after that, but quite the opposite happened.. he is genuinely interested in my life and makes comments about various things showing that he actually cares about my future. For example, I just scored this amazing job I've wanted for years (graduated college 2 years ago), and he had a concerned talk with me about how I need to ""quit the shit"" ""because this is your future, [enter my name]"". Then last time we met up, he took me to his new office space that he and a friend are turning into a barber shop in the hip yet ghetto downtown area. He showed me the layout and when I tried to hand him the money for the dope, he put it back in my hand but threw me a g. I was shocked.

Later that night he even texted me the drawn out floor plans for the space he has rented for the business. I felt flattered that he wanted to show me something so important to him. So I guess my honest question is, is there any possibility this dboy is into me for more than sex or is he just a really really above average nice guy?? Bc truth be told, I'm starting to get those motherfuckin butterflies now whenever I see his name pop up on my phone and I know that is NOT normal!

Edit: I also would like to clarify I am highly doubtful I'm his only customer he's putting the moves on. I just feel like I'm seeing a different side to him than most would expect to see in this situation, like he's revealing more of himself and his personal life to me and vice versa. And I really do trust him on that level. I'm not expecting a marriage proposal or even a date proposal lol. It's just nice to have someone like him in my life, I guess.

And I usually don't do dope on Adderall, don't feel the urge. Before taking the Adderall I did 6 8mg dillies and did not get a single rush like I expected... My tolerance is MUCH higher now apparently because 8mg of dilly use to give me a godly rush man. Even 2mg I'd feel.. They were real Hydromorphone. It's the tolerance for sure. 

BUT....

This fuxking time I have been shooting like a point and a half to 2 points every 2 hours... I thought it'd last me at least 2 nights ya know... But once I get my hands on it I have a hard time not doing it till its gone.. Because my guess is this dope is fent not heroin what so ever. And my 1cc 100 unit syringe can't hold more than 2 points I think. Actually barely holds 2.. It's sooo dark when it's in the syringe I can't even tell when I register unless I got my flashlight shining on the syringe as I'm injecting. 

This was my last cop tho. I'm starting my formula to quit tomorrow. I hope it works, wish me the best.. 

I also got Super Mario Odyssey today but the Adderall kept me on runescape alllllllllll day and guess what.. I lost 15 MIL gambling in the game too... Was so upsetting.

but basically my buddy gave me a 100mg morpheine.
I have a decent tolerance to synthetic opiates like hydros and so forth.

I got the bright idea of plugging it, but kept messing up so I basically used the whole 100mg and insufflated about a tenth of that.

I thought it wasnt working for 15 minutes and now boom.
strangest opiate high I've ever felt, weighted, but euphoric nonetheless, almost energetic. I always brushed off the idea of plugging but when I knew oral ROA would be lame, I couldn't not miss the chance. I wasn't uncomfortable whatsoever.

totally different from my normal pleasures.

please keep in note before this I consumed 2mg alprazolam.

now is the question, I also purchased 2 10mg zolpidem from him, when or should I at all consume though additionally. I've never had them, but what are your opinions on their effects?",1521790883.0

I only took them maybe once a day and when I run out, im out, I never buy them off the street, im just out. This time I got my meds and took 70 mgs right off the bat. I had incredible energy but absolutely no high whatsoever. I have never taken suboxone or methadone or anything like that and no changes in medication since last month when I took them last and got a high. I did notice it seemed like it took more and the high just wasnt as good, like I was fighting for it. I have never taken more than 5 oxycontin er ( extended release but I break them down so they release right now ) and 5 oxycodone. I'm wondering if I need to wait longer than a month and go without or what could be causing this. In all the years of taking them this has never happened. It also has never given me the insane amount of energy. I just finished radiation for lung cancer and am always tired but the last two days I can't even explain the energy, like taking 5 adipex.

My question is, if I have some sort of back pain all day around would I be better off maybe trying an ER instead of IR? I thought they quit making OxyContin but someone here mentioned they still make it but I think only extended release. I have a few disc herniations, sciatica that runs down my leg and my s1 joint is to the point my hip doesn’t stay fully in place having to always go to the Chiropractor to stay in alignment. 

These hydros aren’t cutting it especially after coming off of bupe. They are barely keeping me out of withdrawal. Still have some rls pretty bad an I even got myself down to 2mg of bupe a day sometimes less. Is there any other type of ER med you guys recommend over an IR for pain? The only thing I don’t like about IR is sure you get a half decent buzz but a few hours later and my pain is back which ruins any sort of positive effects the opiate gave you. Do you think there’s any chance I could eventually work my way to an ER and IR for breakthrough pain? I hate to even mention the names of any painkiller to not see like a drug seeker. However, this was even my doctors opinion to quit the bupe without me bringing it up and he’s the most liberal type of doctor I’ve had, if you know what I mean. Should I just be straight up and be like how about roxicodone or is that pushing it? I just hate to keep paying my doctor for something that doesn’t work. It has been just over a year since I’ve had a full agonist opiate other than a couple 5mg hydro the last few days to try and make my withdrawal bareable. He says I can call in if they don’t work but I hate to see like a drug seeker and I thought maybe he’s testing me???

I want to be at the point I only need maybe 30-40 mg of oxycodone when in pain and get relief. Now that I’m older and been down the road of experimenting with H I really don’t find interest in chasing a high because Ik that will just lead me to running out of scripts early. I do not want to lose this doctor. Also is Dilaudid still given out or is it pretty rare? I remember a few years ago how well only 1-2 pills of those worked for pain (snorted btw) because oral for those is a no go. Do you think a doctor from Syria would possibly write for those if I brought it up or is oxycodone just as good for pain? I just want to find my perfect med and stick with it. I think it may hurt that I’m in my 20a btw. The doctor knows my pain is legit my father had to drive me to the doctors the other day because I pulled my back out again only from sweeping the garage floor and could barely get around. He could tell i was in some pain. Any recommendations for pain like this would be highly appreciated! Thanks in advance.",1521764770.0

But as I have stated is previous posts, I ve been getting pain medicine for about a month now. It started with going to the hospital who gave me 5/325 norcos. Then to my PCP who also gave me 5/325 norcos and a referral to a back and spine surgeon.  
This about 2 weeks since my hospital visit. I see the back doctor, they order an MRI and give me 30x 5mg oxycodone.  
Another week later, I go back to go over the MRI, they want another one contrast so i get another order for an MRI and another script, but 61x 5mg oxycodone.  
Another week, i go in and the main surgeon is in surgery that day, so i reschedule but get another 60x 5mg oxycodone and 20x 10mg oxycontin (OP). I tell my doctor i have to fly for a work meeting which she advised against, but i had no choice. I have to do what i can do to keep my health insurance and career. Well of course i blew.  
So i get back, of course already blew through my script. I call the doctor and she says they are about to close, early since it's friday. And i could either just take my empty bottles to urgent care and see if they can give me a 3 or 4 day script since i have an appt on tuesday. Or if i can make it until monday i can come in then but still have to go back in tuesday since the main surgeon who i need to see is not there on mondays (surgery days).  
Well I guess im going to go to urgent care tomorrow and ask for a script for sunday, monday and tuesday until i can get back to see the back/spine doctor.
  
My doctor seems amazing! She is so compassionate and caring. When i was on the phone with her friday telling her i ran out of my script, she sighed and said ""i hate to say it, but i told you so. I knew you were going to be in more pain because of that plane ride""  
  
Anyway, I go in tuesday and im assuming will finally set a date for surgery or see what other options i may have. I want to tell her that when i was on the plane and i took a few more than i was supposed (which ive already told her i did) i noticed how much of a difference it made.  
I want to ask her if I can possibly up the dose of the 5mg oxycodone maybe 10mg or 15mg since the 5mg is not acting as effectively any more.  
  
  
TL;DR I want to ask my doctor to up my prescription of 5mg oxycodone to 10mg 15mg oxycodone",1521928689.0

As I'm sure you all are familiar with, its fuckin hard to cum on opiates, so I'll often enjoy an orgasm before my first dose of the day.  However, if I have an orgasm before I take stimulants or opiates, I often find a marked decrease in the amount of euphoria I would expect from my dose.  And as a corollary, I find if its been days since I last had an orgasm, the high is usually more pronounced and lasts longer (especially with stimulants).  I realize that many factors go into this, but all things equal, I find isolating this variable does yield different results in my high. 

Now I know, it sounds like common sense - we all know orgasm is a chain reaction of a bunch of neurotransmitters all firing off, so if you use your stores of dopamine and serotonin on an orgasm, your brain will need time to get those back to normal levels, right? So I imagine if you take a drug immediately after, you won't have as much dopamine to work with as you would have prior to the orgasm. Since dopamine is primarily responsible for the euphoria of most drugs, I figure the decrease in euphoria is due to less dopamine available - at least, this is the basic idea behind my theory. But this is all conjecture on my part, I've never found anything scientific to base this on.

I have debated this for years in my head and from personal experience I think I have a fairly consistent answer, but I wanna hear from other people. Has anyone else found decreased euphoria from opiates (or other dopamine-inducing drugs - stims, etc) when taken shortly after orgasm? I have searched so much online for anything on this topic but can never find anything.",1521923589.0

--
Hi r/opiates, 

After I stopped using everyday a few years ago, I have been using heroin every now and then. I have done mostly painkillers, and have tried heroin maybe a handful of times my entire life. 

Two weeks ago, I picked some up for the first time after I moved cities. I bought a bun, paid $100, and after he left I realized the powder is completely white (I have only seen tan/brown ones). I did some research here and decided to be very, very careful as it had higher chance of being pent and I haven't used since last April.

I tried it for the first time last Thursday (9 days ago), sniffed starting from a rice sized bump into lines. I went through one stamp that night, feeling the euphoric rush at times as I did longer/bigger lines. But it seemed to last very short amount of time, maybe 10 minutes? 
It was also the first time I couldn't sleep after, and I had trouble falling asleep a few days after too. I just felt like complete shit after that night for days and ended up fainting two days after.

And last night I did it again (after a week), had a great time. Finished 1.5 stamps and were able to sleep after this time. 
But this morning, I woke up feeling sick, threw up, almost fainted, and feel a bit like a zombie. I cannot seem to be able to process anything in my brain. But the weirdest thing is though, I just noticed that I have crazy pinned pupils right now... I've never had pinned pupils that lasted 13-14 hours!! 

I honestly have never felt like this way after a night of using, but I am not sure if that is because I haven't for a while.. So I wanted to ask you guys, has any of these symptoms happen to you or did I just pick up something that is not heroin at all??



TLDR - White dope only providing very short duration of euphoric feeling (~10min) seems to be creating symptoms: difficulty sleeping for days after use, nausea the morning after, pinned pupil lasting 14 hours, unable to process things, and fainting. Anyone else have experience any of these symptoms before?",1521916627.0

Is it better to do big lines or spread out the lines? Sniff strongly or just enough to coat my nasal passage? I shouldn't be tasting the drip 10 seconds after my line, correct? 


I did 17 bags yesterday and didn't feel anything. I'm scared of needles so I really don't want to go down that path. I get bundles for $30 which is the lowest price I've ever had from a dealer so I've been going to this guy for the past 3 months.",1521916334.0

A wife. To do wholesome, do-gooder stuff like teaching children to read and think critically and act ethically.

Now, I am so afraid of being gaslighted and hit and cheated on, that I have not had sex with anyone who knows my full name or my address in 15 years... I think I am physically incapable of trusting anyone enough to put my name on there lease with anyone else 

It's just not an option.

So... What to do? Opiates. Because literally everything else I had an interest in doing it involved a partner... A close male friend or a female significant other. But having my closest friends and my only real significant other all lie to me about the most important thing to me has left me hopeless...

I want to travel -- with someone.

I want to start a business -- with someone.

I want to watch films and analyze them -- with someone.

I want to learn new skills -- with someone.

And as soon as i get sober, I'm so miserable that any potential friend would have to pick me up and get me moving... But I'm too old for that now, new friends don't just see me on the street and see what's up with me just based on my presence.

So... What the fuck? Life just sucks I guess. I felt happy on methadone, but it was poison to my physical body. I can't hold a job because when I'm sober I just move slow and think slow. I still don't have the balls for suicide. I just don't, and that's really frustrating to know, to know that I'm just at the mercy of biological imperatives at all times -- of my need for other human beings to just be near them for psychological reasons, because isolation affects me biochemically, for sex, for opiates since my brain was always fucked and I always felt miserable without them, and, finally, that I can't commit suicide because I have the survival instinct that is so strong...

I just feel like a worthless idiot. I should have been making better people than myself by now.",1521916268.0

(Journalist Inquiry),"Hi everyone. I’m a journalist who covers opioid stories for VICE News on HBO. This sub is a valued resource for me. I spend quite a bit of time on here looking for what’s not being covered by mainstream publications (and the answer is a lot). One thing that has jumped out at me, particularly when reading the fent warnings, is how the ubiquity of fentanyl has changed attitudes and behaviors for people who use.

I’m working on a segment focused in NYC and, based on my own reporting and insight from this sub, I’m struck by the way many (if not most) people take it as a given that their bags contain fentanyl. What’s also interesting is how attitudes to this new reality vary. Some seem to proceed more or less business as usual, despite the rise in ODs. But I’m also seeing more prevention strategies employed, like on-the-ready narcan, test doses, using with a buddy, etc. And I see more people trying to quit or get on MAT rather than take further risks with a bad batch.

So I’d like to put the question to this community - how have you adapted to the new normal? Has fentanyl’s rise changed how you use? I am working on a video piece, but I’d appreciate any insight even if off-the-record/background. And feel free to send me a note at seth.dalton@vice.com.",1521897876.0

What amount of Oxy in Mg would you all consider to be a small/medium/large/insane tolerance?

Right now, I can quite easily consume 100Mg~ daily without giving it much thought at all. Am I wasting my Oxy? 

For instance, last month I didn’t take any Oxy. This month, the last two weeks, I have consumed 56 40mg tabs and now onto my second pack. Is this wasteful? 

I’m just trying to gauge if I should slow things down a lil bit to get the most out of my product. I don’t have any issues with stock potentially running out. Nor will I loose my house/car/set of bagpipes to outstanding depts.

Just want to respect Oxy as I am aware it is a very precious and sought after commodity.

FYI, I am familiar with Oxy and pharmaceutical opiates/oids In general. Have indulged in varying degrees for many years so am aware of the potential pitfalls/benefits and am comfortable with my own limits/aware of my own body.

My first experience with them, I had tried to crush the little spheres inside and it simply didn't work. They don't crush insofar as they *smush*and just turn into a flat sheet of plastic/matrix shit.

When I ended up snorting it, it plastisized the inside of my nose and didn't drip **at all** and hours after I snorted it I was snorking plastic shit out of my nose.

I'll add that I didn't get much of a buzz for the amount I snorted.

Fast-forward to now. I took 2, 18 mg capsules and emptied the contents onto a small aluminum billet (2x3.5 inches) as it has a small 3mm lip so stuff doesn't spill out. Turns out this was a good idea.

I put the powder on the billet and put it in a toaster oven @ 350 degrees. Within a few minutes it didn't turn brown or anything, rather it melted exactly like wax would. It turns utterly clear like wax.

I didn't let it boil, instead I removed the billet with tongs and set it in the freezer on a slab of ice/frost. It immediately solidified **exactly** like wax would going from utterly clear to opaque in seconds. Once it was solidified it had features of very hard wax insofar as you could scrape it with your fingernail and remove bits easily with your nail but I was at a loss as to how this current form would be used intra-nasally. 

I reheated the waxy stuff and added a pinch of baking soda and mixed it up slightly and re-heated it once again.

About a minute later it had re-liquified but was more opaque when liquified vs being crystal clear before.

Again I set it in the freezer and it solidified but was whiter from the  baking soda this time.

Now when you scrape it with a knife, it actually scrapes up [powder.](https://imgur.com/a/czyBb)
I insufflated about half of the material and waited. The baking soda burned a little bit but on a positive note my nose ran like hell just like when I oven-method oxycontin OP's and snort them.

25 mins later I'm happily buzzed so I feel that although I wouldn't say I *defeated* the time release matrix (I didn't destroy it per se) I did, however, change it's form to something that my nose can use. I'm not snorking back chunks of anything whatsoever. Just liquid at this point which is a super plus in the pro column.

My nose *does* feel congested though although it might just be from the irritation from the baking soda. I'll update this post it I end up snorking back a massive blob of plastic or something.

So, yeah. Pretty nifty. :)

**UPDATE** - It *definitely* works better than trying to snort the Xtampza spheres in stock form. I'm absolutely as high as I expected to be on 20mg of oxy.

*Interesting note for chem nerds* - XTampza is Oxycodone proper. Not Oxycodone HCL. It's my understanding that this reason ties into why all Xtampza capsules are slightly less milligrams than their Oxycodone HCL counterparts. Meaning the 20mg equivalent is 18mg, the 10mg oxy equivalent is 9mg and the 40mg equivalent is 36mg.

I'm purely speculating but is it safe to assume that mixing with stomach acid or some other first pass metabolism action is what converts to the HCL version? Food for thought.

This little amount of oxy is enough to make my day good. On the bad days it helps makes things bearable, and on the good days it makes life feel content and happy. I'm not getting super high secretly and it’s not impacting my work or relationships, but I am self-medicating (with a very low dose)

I'm writing this here because I haven't talked to anyone in my life about this. I'd like to get some outside perspective. 
I know some people would label this as 'high-functioning addict' but I truly don't think I fit into this category. I don't ever take more than prescribed to me, struggle to control my dosage, or abuse drugs otherwise. 
The little amount I use everyday is mentally therapeutic, and at such a low dose, is it really abuse?
I feel as though I use it medicinally. It mentally supports me and gives me a little push, to enable me to find the happiness in myself on the days where I can't.
Does anyone else have this type of experience with low dose self medicating with opiates?",1521862252.0

Did good for a bit and screwed up. Told myself if that happens I will get rite back into treatment. I ended up having to wait a few days longer then I wanted to, waiting to pick up a car I had purchased so I can get back and forth to work.

I've called 6 places, no beds, long wait lists. So im going to do what I always do, show up at the ER say im addicted to heroin and suicidal (I do have 2 attempts on the books that both left me in the ICU on life support) and this garuntees me a bed. Only issue is you are stuck in the crisis unit, with MAYBE an ativan if you are lucky. Waking up dope sick in that tiny room with the bed nailed to the floor in the center of the room, blank white walls, is fucking terrifying.

WILL A HAND HELD METAL DETECTOR PICK UP ONE INSULIN SYRINGE?

I honestly can't remember if they want you're person or just the clothes you come in with.... My idea is double bag a small plastic cooker, my 2 bundles, and one syringe. Years ago I stayed in a dry homeless shelter and they would use a hand on us everyday, never had an issue sneaking in an insulin syringe. Any thoughts on this? It would suck to have to like be watched every time i go to the bathroom and then if I do shit out everything catch a possession charge rite?? If it does go off around my ass you think they'll know enough to suspect I've got something up there? Maybe when I see the triage nurse I will only mention feeling suicidal. That way they won't suspect paraphernalia on me if it goes off. Later in the crisis unit, a special worker comes to see you, I can let her know im hooked on dope and suicidal.

My question is what is the benefit of split dosing vs full dosing? Also if anyone has any experience on pregnancy and methadone and also babies born on methadone as I'm very concerned about this. Please no harsh judgement and attacks, like I said I HATE myself already for being on this, and tried and spoke to multiple specialists about coming off while pregnant and they all advised against it. Also , I am on this med for pain management not as a maintainance to stay of heroin or drug addiction. I unfortunetly moved to a state 7 months ago that refuses to prescribe subutex or any other med for chronic pain and just refers people to the methadone clinic. I had been on subutex for 2 plus years and done great on it and then moved across the country thinking is be able to establish care here and be able to continue on the same med and treatment plan, unfortunately that wasn't the case.

I was definitely unlucky.  

Six months the psychiatrist changed me from ativan tablets to the undiluted liquid.  He gave me two options: IM ativan or the drops.

I'm 30 and I've *never* been offered anything injectable (and I never expected to be). But, I already do testosterone shots biweekly and I've been doing them for 11 yrs.  I have soooo much scar tissue.

I turned him down and was prescribed the drops.

Well his PA was not made aware of this.  Bottle in tow, I meet with her.  My last fill was 2/15 and it was 3/15. She gets very hostile with me about the change.  She's bitching about how I didn't need it and how I was on pain meds... I've heard it all before.

I tell her when I met her I was on fentanyl patches and liquid morphine *AND* ativan.  She had no problem then filling for it.  

This time I'm only on liquid hydrocodone... Big difference yet now she's got an issue. Telling me I'm a year post op from my spinal fusion and shouldn't still need the opioids.....

Fucking hate people like this.  I'm the genetic lottery of shit ( my PM doc's words).  I've got many painful conditions and will probably be *medicated for life*.  

She tells  me she'll renew my script but I can't get it til the 23rd...

WTF lady can you not count?!

I try and explain but she's not listening.  I then ask about something for WDs.  She tells me no and good luck.

My pharmacist is furious.  They send  my wellbutrin... She tries to contact  them to no avail 

Now I'm in benzo WD.  

My anxiety is fucking insane.  I now cannot move without the spasticity fucking knocking me off my feet.  My muscle spasms I can't kick.  My autism and ADHD go haywire!!!.

I'm miserable.  I meet with my PM doc who is livid.  He's so mad about the irresponsibility of the psychiatrists office.  He tells me I could have died.  He prescribes me Clonidine patches along with the hydrocodone and gabapentin 

So my ativan will be ready Monday.  My patches need a prior authorization so I'm not on them.

I'm over most of the WDs.  Even though my other medical conditions are in full swing I have no fatigue anymore.  I can get and keep a hard on which I've not been able to on the ativan.

My issue... I dunno if I want to get back on the ativan anymore.  I like being able to get an erection and I like not being fatigued...but my other conditions are really bad without it.

I'm at a cross road...

Td;lr: I've been off my ativan for over a week now.  My other medical conditions are really bad because of it (anxiety, Autism, ADHD, spasticity, and muscle spasms ).. *BUT* I can get and keep my erections and I've really got *NO* fatigue.

Should I axe the ativan?",1521978318.0

He doesn't understand how fucked up that is and said if I got offered $1,000 for each of my two cats would I sell them and I said no never, I love my cats and they love me I've had them since birth if never get rid of them, then he said what about $5,000 to throw them off a cliff. And at that point I was like wtf is wrong with you, that's a whole new level of fucked up, no way in the fucking world for any amount of money would I ever do that. 
He thinks him selling his dog is not fucked  up at all, he doesn't see what's wrong with it. He also said he'd make sure the family is nice and he would be able to visit his dog like twice a MONTH which is his reason for it not being fucked up, and it's not like he's Giving it to a shelter or an abusive home 

Here's a strawpoll I've made I told him ask anyone else and they'll tell you selling the dog would be fucked up and he didn't believe me, not only am I going to be other peopled inputs, I hope to get peoples input from this sub who knows how it is to have no money and need quick cash to score and so you don't withdrawl.

I've literally been hospitalised before when I tried to end my opiate addiction and felt like shit emotionally, but from day one I felt happy as larry with the Modafinil, no depression or sweats or anxiety... nothing. Even though I was taking higher opiate doses for longer than ever.

Why is noone talking about this? My sex drive even came back within a couple of days and my girlfriend says my personality has done a complete 180, and she's happier than ever with me, we used to argue so much before. I'm exercising, enjoying socialising again...my mental sharpness I thought had been lost forever has returned... honestly my mind is blown. 

The only downside is that sleeping for 8 uninterrupted hours is obscenely difficult, although melatonin is helping with that. I also now have to face all the shit I was using opiates to hide from and bury for all those years, which is emotionally quite difficult at times.

I guess the difference in quality can be a factor in how much people use, but that's besides the point. I wanna know how much and how often you guys use.

For me, I'll use either a blue (plugged or snorted), 0.1g of tar(smoked or plugged), or 20-40mg of #4 (snorted) on days I use. Maybe 2-4 times a week depending on what I have. I'll treasure oxys until I'm out of tar and #4 but by then my tolerance is so high I have to wait a couple days to use again.",1521942578.0

I went to pick up 50 upj90s tues/wed and of course thought 1 little q wouldn't hurt and and a g of flake. Its my detox routine don't knock it too much. Had a few low days then and out of the blue picked up tranex which I love. Am a week without opis I think or so which is good even if Im a temporary worse freak.

Anyways I have plenty of stories of detoxing in chaos but I wont bore you.

You clutch everyone money and start the car. You take off down the street following the old white car and than it pulls over in a random neighborhood. He ask how much you want as you pull up next to window. You ask for 3 and he pulls out three balloons from a his mouth. You hand him the money and he hands you the magical powder. Than it’s over in a flash as you drive away to your safe spot. Everyone is happy now but also anxious.... will it be good? I hope it’s not shit....damn I hope I can find a vein!!!

You cut open the ballon and the room smells of strong vinegar and you begin to sweat. You break off a good chunk of blackness and hand the wrest to your friend. The chunk now lays on the cooker waiting for some hydration. You pump your needle full of water and spray it al over the tar and begin to cook it. It’s starting to bubble and stink up the room but you know soon the relief will come. Now your frantically chewing off a piece of cotton filter from your cigarettes do you placing your cooker. The car turns from the snow white to a dark brown. Then you take your rig and sucked up the golden nectar that awaits you. Now you check for bubbles in your rig and give it a couple taps to knock them to the top and you give it a little push on the plunger. You find a old sock that you always use to tie off on your arm and pump it so your vein pop out. Your ready now, it like that moment seconds before you ha e to take a shit and reach a toilet. You take the fresh rig and place it over the vein and push it into your arm... than bang pressure has built up in the rig and it’s almost like a spark of blood has filled it. This is it you say to yourself the money I have been waiting for hours. You slowly start to push the plunger down on the rig trying to to upset the balance. Slowly the stopper goes past all the small numbers and reaches the end. You rip the tie off from your red arm and lean back. Bam! You taste vinegar in the back of your throat and a hot hug embraces your body. Your tense muscles loosen up, the cold sweat is gone, no more pain just pure bliss.

For instance if you were to have the Monoamine oxidase A enzyme within your DNA then you’re far more likely to have a certain number of behavior characteristics naturally that wouldn’t be derived strictly from environmental factors; aggression, impulsiveness, reckless, mania. If you had any sort of blue clues about mental disorders and how they counteract with with serotonin and endorphins then you would understand the they are CATALYSTS for suicide, drug addiction, criminal activity, amongst other things....which COOO COOO CATCHOOO, it sounds like from that aspect that having a certain lack of natural medium chemistry within your brain...something you CANT control....can lead towards a ton of perceptions and behaviors that a “average” person wouldn’t have access to naturally....which is why your perception is heavily skewed and misconstrued and geared way more towards your obnoxious superiority complex...since you can’t accurately understand somebody else and it seems you have a very hard time removing your emotional responses in order to rationally step into a entire different mind...I guess it’s safe to say YOU DONT know anything about psychology or anything expertise wise within any sort of field.

I remember going there with my dad and best friend eagerly waiting for the park to open up. There was a massive crowd and people were sprinting there to avoid the 2 hour line - I remember my dad trying to keep up to me and my friend. We had to wait about 45 minutes, but it was totally worth it. I remember seeing all the other people being dropped from 20 stories up, the thriller screams, and their faces when they got off the ride. I couldn't wait and when it was finally our turn, I was nervous but extremely excited. 


It was my first time on a ride like this. After strapping in, we slowly made our way to the top. We were so high up, we could see everything: the parking lot, the water park, even how long the lines were on other rides. We stopped at the top and I was so excited for what was to happen next. 


The first time I dropped was the greatest feeling in the world. I was in free-fall, felt like I was floating - it was the first time I wasn't connected to our world, because I was experiencing a world without gravity for the first time. Then the brakes hit as we approached the bottom. My heart was pounding and I was so happy - that was the greatest feeling in the world. 


We didn't return to the Giant Drop that day due to the long lines, but after we left, all I could think about was how great it felt to be free-falling like that. The initial drop was by far the greatest part. I begged my dad to go back everyday for the next few weeks. Finally we returned and again had to race to the Giant Drop at opening to beat the lines. We were strapped back in, made our way to the top, and were dropped. 


Again, it was an amazing feeling free falling like that, but it wasn't quite the same as the first time. Words can't really explain what that initial drop felt like, when you go from weighing over 100 lbs to weighing nothing in a fraction of a second, but I absolutely loved it. That summer and the following years, I must have rode the Giant Drop 100 times and loved it every time, but it was never as good as the first time, maybe because I knew what to expect.


Many many years later as an adult, I was bored with the Giant Drop, it just didn't do what it did for me as a child. I heard about the Lex Luther Drop in California and went for a visit during vacation. Sure it was a little more expensive, but the tower was so much higher. Adult me felt like a child again riding up and then we dropped. My adrenaline was pumping and I screamed at the top of my lungs. I absolutely loved it, but again, I could never experience that initial drop like I did the first time. We rode it several times and it was a blast, but not quite the same.


I'm still convinced a higher drop would feel amazing and I could experience that initial drop like I did for the first time. I'm even willing to pay more for a higher tower. But what goes up must come down - the further you fall, the harder the brakes have to work and the greater toll on your body as you're brought to a stop. The stopping is worth it though because being that high is so good. 


In this case the brakes are like your kidneys and liver. They can only take so much and if you drop from high enough, your brakes won't be able to stop you completely and you'll come crashing into the ground. Even if you have a rough landing and make a trip to the ER, you still want to get to the top, find a higher tower because it's so much fun. 


You pay more and more to get higher and higher but you never experience that initial drop you've been craving so much. This goes until you get so high that your brakes can't stop you all the way. You come plummeting to the ground and end up 6 feet under, where you'll stay the rest of your life.

Yesterday we announced that craigslist-I-can't-use-the-search-function-or-google posts are no longer allowed. Those jeopardized the subreddit due to reddit's new content policy, and they were annoying as fuck. The item we will be addressing today is: **the hundreds of candy posts that aren't dope porn!**

Okay, we get it, we all love candy, and sour candy in particular, but there comes a point in time when no one wants to see your picture of your SPK's that don't even have a Norco in the picture. If you wanna throw some candy in there with your dope porn shots, be my guest, but we are no longer allowing your Instagram filtered pictures of generic sour belts that don't have drugs in the picture. 

We are trying to get this sub back to the days where the vast majority of content created dialogue, shared a story, promoted harm reduction, or just flat out made your mouth water from the awesomeness of the drugs you had! We understand that not every post is going to be amazing and there is still going to be a lot of stuff that gets asked a lot/reposted, but we don't need this sub filled with a bunch of crap that has nothing to do with opiates, doesn't create dialogue, or doesn't build the sense of community.

This subreddit is home to amazing people with amazing stories and knowledge to share. Seeing a dozen posts like these a day is starting to drive many of the long time users away who come here for the quality of the content. We are doing our best as moderators to curate the content without just removing everything, and it's not easy. I hope everyone understands why this decision was made and we are doing the things we are doing. If you guys have any feedback on this topic or others similar to it we would love to hear it.

And let's say sometime between 8-36 hours after my last dose, i decide to take a break and grab some H. Ignoring the fact that I should really be waiting longer, in a situation like this, should i be worried about precipitated withdrawal _at all_, or could I perhaps take a suboxone the next day, as little at 6-10 hours later. 

I know that 10 hours is probably plenty of time for some people to bounce into a decent COWS score, but the timing of my onsets tend to linger, so this would be a pretty short timeline for me. But what I'm wondering is, any high that I'm getting from the H (which I can actually get surprisingly high day of, maybe because I keep my sub doses on the low side) should really only be bound to the receptors that i have free since it's not knocking the suboxone off of any receptors. And since I have, in this scenario, taken, say 2mg of subuxone each of the three days before, my free receptors should beat low capacity. So, is it possible that taking a sub even as little as 4 hours afterward wouldn't even put me into PW, simply because that sub can only bind to a maximum amount of receptors, most of which are already bound by the previous suboxone that i took in the days leading up. maybe this doesn't make sense, and maybe they would just bind to other receptors anyway, but i'm curious nonetheless.

to preface my other question, i am a somewhat new H user in terms of comparison, but by no means am i even jokingly considered opiate naive. so my second question, unrelated to the first is, at what point in terms of hours, do i no longer have to worry about ""nodding out"" in a _negative_ way. i am prone to anxiety, so i worry about nodding out and something happening, despite the fact that i'm really not taking that much, generally. i even very, very often take benzos with my blues and subs and i don't worry at all about it because i have very high tolerances to both. but with H, i usually am too scared to do this, and often don't take any benzos even in the same day; although, on occasion, i will take one maybe 3-6 hours after my last dose, but this even scares me sometimes. 

i've kind of gotten off-topic now talking about the benzos, but anyway, i hope you all have some answers for me. i appreciate this community as i have often found great answers around here. thanks!",1522051552.0

It’s been about a month now that I basically lost all of my connections...which forced me to go through WD’s that would’ve been so much worse had I not had a good amount of gabapentin + lope on hand. It wasn’t until a little over a week after that I finally started to feel better and actually considered just quitting altogether, until earlier today that is. 

Okay, so...I get a text from one of my old plugs who practically cut me off because someone was being a snitch and he thought that someone might be me. Well, turns out he found said person then proceeded to apologize for what happened, claiming that he’s back at it and he’s already got a little somethin for me. HALLELUJAH. 
I’m a little conflicted though...while I was overjoyed in excitement, i simultaneously felt horrible that I was about to go right back to the one thing that I legitimately considered kicking just yesterday. 

With all that said if there’s any positive side to all of this, it’s that 1.) A month off gives for one hell of a tolerance break lol. 
And 2.) In all seriousness, I do want to kick this shit for good. Maybe not right at this very moment in time but it will happen and when it does happen, at least I know I CAN do it and it certainly isn’t as bad as I imagined it being in my mind.

One thing I don't understand is - does Serotonin Syndrome with tramadol occur only when taking high doses, if no other drugs are present?

I took 150 mg yesterday and 180 mg today. At one point today, I became very anxious which is not really normal for tramadol, and also felt slight tremors/tensed muscles, so I became scared of SS. However, it could be just as well possible that I got anxious and got tremors *because* I was scared when thinking about SS. I've also read that tramadol can cause anxiety because of its noradrenergic properties.

What do you guys think? Is it really possible that I'm at risk if I only took 150 and 180 mg respectively two days in a row, or I'm just hypochondriac and scaring myself? I'm kinda paranoid right now. I'm not epileptic or anything, and I don't take any medications, besides kratom which I took 3 days ago.

EDIT: I’ve decided to just post the questions. If you can answer them right in the comments, that’d be awesome. 

1. How did you begin your addiction to opioids?



2. How did you feel society looked at you while you were still dealing with addiction?



3. Did you ever ask for help and that attempt was unsuccessful? Why?



4. What was your rock bottom/turning point?



5. What do you think about the opioid crisis right now? Has it always been there but has just moved into the suburbs and now it’s an important issue?



6. How do you feel about prescription opioids being handed out as a first line of medication from hospitals/doctors?



7. How do you feel society looks at people in recovery?



8. How do you feel about drug courts instead of the traditional court system?



9. What kind of loopholes have you found, if any, within our health care system in regards to dealing with addiction/getting more pain pills/etc.?



10. Any suggestions on how to help the epidemic?



11. What are your thoughts on medication like Suboxone? Do they help or perpetuate the problem?



12. How long have you been clean? How have you grown personally since your addiction? If not clean, how long have you been addicted? Have you tried to seek out help? If not, why?

•Went to this dude twice before for Opana

•Told me to pick him up on his street, I did

•He told me to go to the store around the corner because his dude is the one that has it

•Got there and pulled in next to the car

•I gave him the money and he got out and got in the dudes car

•Then he takes off on me and the car dips out

I was pulled in and he was facing out, and chasing would have done nothing for me. Not going to waste more money in gas.

What’s the chances he’s gonna actually give me the drugs? Think it’ll be a bunk pack just to rub it in more? It just doesn’t sit right after he did that. Does he feel bad for running off? 

Edit: he is trying a little hard to get me to meet him
He says he’ll face time me the drugs and all his gear to show he’s serious. I asked if he could do the mailbox thing tonight and he said he can’t because I might take it “and say I never got it”.
