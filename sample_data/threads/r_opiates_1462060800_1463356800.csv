I got these **Compensan retard 200mg** pills, containing 200mg of Morphinhydrochlorid-Trihydrat, which equals roughly 150mg of pure Morphine from what I've read.

I was with a friend of mine and at early afternoon we both took a third of the powdered pill as a bomb, so 50mg each. 30 to 40 minutes later each of us took another bomb with 25mg. We both didn't notice anything throughout the afternoon. 
I myself have no experience with Opiates, my friend however has a few with weaker Opiates, but no real tolerance according to him.
I was thinking we haven't noticed any effects simply because the bio-availability is so bad for oral consumption and the dose too low.

In the same evening of that day I did some 2C-B with a different friend of mine who came over and we had a fun time, but in the morning I woke up feeling sick, I had a headache and I had this weird feeling that I'd have to throw up any moment and laid in bed all day. I assumed this was because of the 2C-B, I did a pretty high dose.

So, 2 days ago I wanted to give the Morphine another try, and since I assumed the dose was simply too low, **I now took half a pill as a bomb, and then half an hour later the other half as a bomb as well, which should equal 150mg of Morphine in total. I maybe felt a bit relaxed, but mainly drained out of power, but that's it**. I couldn't sleep at all that night (kind of contradictory) and had the same feeling of sickness I had the other day and even had to throw up in the morning when I got out of bed. So I spent another day in bed.

Now there is two things in my mind, one being, that I apparently shouldn't take Morphine again, because it makes me feel sick. My friend didn't feel bad after I took it with him the first time. But the other thing is, **why did I only *barely* feel the Morphine? Was the dose for oral consumption still too low?** 
I read many swearing on plugging Morphine, mainly because the bio-availability is much higher I guess. So I question myself 1) **if the Morphine is responsible for making me feel sick, would plugging it avoid that?** and 2) **if I barely felt a whole pill orally, how much would I need to plug?**",1462110267.0

I received a script when I was discharged from the hospital of ~40 2mg dilaudid tablets. I have micron filters and clean works and am an IV H user anyway so obviously I've been banging them. 

I will admit that the rush is amazing, the best I've ever experienced. Almost every time I nearly have to moan from the sensation. It's quite different even from good H in my opinion. 

But I still hate this drug. For me, there is literally no high after the rush. It is a 15-30s high and then it's over, all I get after that is maybe 4hrs of no withdrawal. So I take a shot before bed then wake up 6hrs later or so already starting to feel some withdrawal effect. It is kind of like opiate crack and I really don't enjoy it. I vastly prefer the more sustained, noddy high of good dope to this bullshit. 

Thoughts? A lot of people online seem to really enjoy the dills but I really wish I could trade the rest of mine for some solid gear. I just have to hold out until Monday evening with these and even that kind of annoys me because of how up and down it is.",1462102495.0

Which is really high as far as I am concerned. It is also a class B felony and I go to court in a few weeks. fucking punk police man he's like 'turn around you're not being arrested..' then BAM slams the cuffs on me.

This week, I have had so much shit happen. A week and a half ago I lost my hotel room I was sharing with my buddy Rocket, this fucking scuntbag Tiff, and Rocket gets my phone stolen because he's ancient and getting Alzheimer's, even though I specifically ask him not to take my phone out of the room. Then, the next day, our hotel room gets broken into by some fuckin tweakers (Tiff's shit got jacked, and I'm glad.), and so the god damn nonsensical management kicks US out. Then, when I went with my boy R and the cunt as she is now dubbed, go to go back to the abandoned house we were staying at before moving to the hotel, there's no room for me basically because the self appointed head house hoe is a bag whore and I don't have the money to support her habit. So I stay with a trick for a few days, and then I come back down here, buy a new phone, and run into the cunt, who says she's down to split a room. Now mind you I've known the cunt for 2 years and we've mostly been cool, and never stolen from each other. On the bus ride to the hotel it was jam packed, and someone pickpockets my phone. Me and a guy friend go to the room, and dude says not to worry about rent he's got it because I'm so tired I'm basically falling asleep standing up. I fall asleep for a few weekends hours and wake up to the manager pounding on the door. we didn't have all the rent and my supposed friend never showed up. I had to call my mom and ask her to Western Union me some money, which made me feel so guilty. I hate asking my parents for money. I had to have her wire it to the cunt since I have no ID. And like I said I thought we were chill, she even left all her shit (except phone and wallet), then the fuckin bitch decides junkies gotta junk and never shows back up. I highly doubt she got arrested, call it a gut feeling. So I'm slowly clucking her shit. 


Warning following content is NSFW

So I know dudes talk about how chicks fuck dboys for dope right. Well... What if a chick got asked by her dealer to fuck him in the ass with a strap on? File it under r/thathappened. . haha


Then I got raped by a trick earlier. He had enough money for what I charge for head, and wants sex, I refuse and go to leave, he says he'll do the bj after all yada yada. So I get to work, well dude starts trying to take my pants off, I say no, he says yes and holds me down and rips my pants off and pins me. I ripped his shirt and chain but my knife wasn't in arms reach and I thought about pepper spraying his ass after but decided it wasn't a good idea in an enclosed vehicle. So basically I had to fucking take it and if I ever see that piece of fuckin shit I'll kill him somehow. I can't go to the cops because I have warrants plus he didn't ... ""Violate"" me hard enough except for a couple of fingerprint bruises where he held my arms down. Ughhh.

Then I went and kept working afterwards because I don't feel like sleeping outside and getting my shit stolen again so I needed to make hotel rent. Good news is I made $200 bucks in an hour so I've got a new phone and some new clothes and rent.


This life I live... Smfh. Definitely not worth the bullshit.


Hope y'all had a better week than me. I should be netting $400 in the next couple days, and I found a new Xan connect, and with any luck I'll be outta here completely in the next week or so.

Now I always experience sleep paralysis but last night scared me like no other because I had experienced what felt like a mix of sleep paralysis and an inability to breathe. It's hard to explain but I was semi conscious in my sleep, I could feel myself struggling to breathe and there was this sharp pain around my heart. I woke up and it literally felt as if I had to catch my breath, like I wasn't breathing and the sleep paralysis wasn't letting me wake up to be able to breathe. 


I ended up waking up and feeling conscious but the left side of my chest was very tight with pressure and there was a sharp pain. It was scary, I was scared to pass out again but I was too damn sleepy to stay awake and I didn't wanna stop breathing again. I'm fine now but this morning the pain was there subtly and if I breathed a certain way the pressure in my heart came back.

So, I'm across the pond UK side from the majority of users on these boards, so I don't know how much difference there is. Are there any safety recommendations? Do I need to mix with anything, like how UK gear requires heating and citric acid to break down before IV. Obviously the strength varies from batch to batch and especially not knowing what the UK brands are. Do I need to mix it with anything to get full effects or to potentiate?

I understand that its an acquired taste - people speak of feeling sick the first time.. yet people go back for more. So I do understand that it can be highly addictive to some people, but I believe I'm strong... I've got a strong constitution! At the moment, I'm only addicted to Heroin so I can easily handle dabbling in this. If I do decide I like it, I can buy a large bag and just chip....  no worries. I even promise myself to use only half a bag in one sitting.

Is it true about developing a tolerance quickly? I read a user here talk about his experience going back to what the dealer SAID was strong, but after the EXTREME sour mix that have hit the streets, going back to regular feels like nothing now.

Anyway, I've hit the streets looking to pick up and I've only been able to find Ha'xx'bo (edited to obscure the source) TANGFASTIC. But I recon. I can handle much stronger stuff. (Apologies for source discussion)

I understand the dangers of strong flavours. For example..   is it anything like capsaicin? I have a friend who reacts hilariously to ""spice"". So we always spike his food and watch him turn bright red and POUR sweat. We are naughty!

So... Seriously, what brands am I seeking out in the UK? Haribo sounds too mainstream to get a decent fix. Supermarket chains seem to be useless. I need proper little corner store dealer selling loose candy by weight.

It's 4am on the east coast where I am located near a major city. I work a part time job during the week but am usually out this late every night during my female friend who is a ""girl of the night"". She compensates me very well as we both have a substantial habit, and I drive her all over to theses people's houses and during the night make at twice to trips to shady areas of the city.

Well tonight we had it planned out earlier in the day that she had 2 dates lined up, I was going to drive her and it would be a normal night. The night before she was able to access her dad's car so I did not drive her. So, I'm thinking we r going out around midnight and all would be done by right around the current time at the latest. At 11pm when u last talk to her she is waiting to hear an exact time nut we have planned that I pick her up at midnight but I tell her to make sure and call me incase I fall asleep. I wake up and glance over at the clock to realize that it is 2am and that she has to have gone out without me, no way she risked not.habong anything for tmro waiting this long. I also see 0 texts from her which really had me frustrated.

So I hit her up not expecting a response really but saying that I know she went out and that it's fucked up because she knows that I rely on her and I go out and get 3 hours of sleep so many nights, etc. She hits me back and says ""Yeah, I woke up late and had to run but I got you when I get back."" (There was a 2 hour nod IRL right here, so gonna sum this up and get ready for work)

Anyhow, she has me meet her right up the street from her house and throws me 4, just like she had the night before AND it's the Kill Bill that had me gooonnnneeee the night before. All in all a great night. I didn't have to go out and not get much sleep but still was rewarded as if I did.

What would be your priorities? Where would you go? Who would you want with you? What's your end goal?

Personally I'd start a convoy and head south towards the coast and then somehow someway steal myself a boat and take all my survivors to an island like Cuba or maybe Hawaii or any island large enough to support life because the nice thing about islands is once you kill off all the zombies you don't have to worry about more showing up, well not counting when the people you brought die. Plus with an island you'd be less likely to have to deal with psychopaths, I'm sure some would make their way there but not as many as the mainland.

The first few months were a dream. Then he told me he was a heroin addict. Lots of stuff happened in between, but basically he blocked me completely out of his life for a month. After multiple attempts to contact him (and feeling like a pathetic loser for caring), he finally responded and we ended up getting back together. 
For the past 4 months he's been clean. He says I saved his life, and I believe that. I own a house, he moved in with me and was helping me fix up the place. Everything was great. A couple weeks ago I noticed he was getting high again (and more importantly, lying to me, stealing from me, and making me feel guilty when I called him out). We talked about it, and although I was really upset and depressed, I thought we were going to get through it. I want to desperately. But then he packed up and left while I was sleeping and hasn't talked to me since. Blocked me and all of our friends on Facebook. 
Should I give up on him? I feel like we were made for each other, and I know he feels the same way. But he left me, twice, without giving me any say in what was going on. I feel completely helpless, but I saved him one time and maybe I can again. I'm willing to live with a recovering addict. I just wish I could trust him not to abandon me. 

Update: You guys are awesome. Thank you for your input. It means a lot to me. He has since emailed me with an apology and somewhat of an explanation (although I'll never be able to wrap my head around how he could block me out of his life at the drop of a hat).

I was sitting out front of the zip trip anxious as shit. It's been 3 weeks since I moved here, and it's been 3 weeks since my last shot of dope. The moment my addict mind has been obsessing about during this 3 weeks is about to happen. 

""I bet that's the mother fucker  right there"" I guessed correctly to myself as a street looking kid about my age came walking around the back of the zip trip, coming around the corner and toward me. ""Hey man."" - ""Sup man, I'm DownNotOutTho"". Fist bump, fuck yeah. I just met my new dope connect.

We bullshit a few, get a ride back toward my place and I get a half g of some sweet looking dark ass tar. Looks almost as good as the shit back home. Too bad it's double the price here.

Fast forward a bit and I'm back in my motel bathroom with a shot prepped and ready to go. Oh, joyous moment. Too bad it was short lived. The bathroom was steamy so I quickly threw a couple kleenex over top of my dope bag. No need to put it somewhere actually safe, right? Wrong.

After a little more prep, I'm staring at the needle in my arm. A small warm explosion of dark blood just sucked into the syringe and mixed together beautifully, like 2 space nebulas floating around contrasting eachother. 

Push the plunger down, aaaaand, there. I just walked back into the gates of heaven. 3 weeks of woes and suffering is instantly melted away into the dark oblivion of black tar heroin. If I keep walking I will fall off heaven into hell.

Numbed and slowed down, I start gathering my things and cleaning up. Put my kit back together and put it away, etc. There are a couple Kleenexes sitting in the counter. I grab them and throw them into the toilet and flush, ensuring I leave no trash behind.

About 2 hours later, what happened hits me like a wall of fucking nails. ""My dope isn't in my pocket .. And it's not in my kit.. Where could it...? Oh fuck. OH, MY FUCK."" Surely it can't be, right? No fucking ADDICT would be careless enough to somehow FLUSH their expensive drugs down the toilet, right???

I'm a person who has a disease that results in chronic severe pain. I've never used opiates in any recreational before or gotten them from anyone other than a doctor.
I was scanning the web last week and found a pharmacy with a phone number, tried to call it, nobody answered, figured whatever.

Two days ago, callback from that number, a guy leaves a message explicitly asking if I want any oxycodone or vicodin etc. I didn't respond, and this afternoon again, he calls. I answer, he's just super up front about what he's selling and how to get it, tells me where he is and that he's served hundreds of customers (could totally have been lying). I told him I hadn't decided what to get and he asked when he could expect my call. Says he doesn't work alter than 3, his local time, in order to get packages sent out.

TL;DR Online pharmacy called me back, super open about what they sell, even leaving a message explicitly offering oxycodone or vicodin on my phone.

Third time was 2 weeks later and that was from fenty dope, again at my friends place who has narcan. 

Fourth time in my parents house and I was being an idiot and measured my dose out in a rush. 

I don't know if this is normal for anyone, but shit this doesn't ever happen to me usually, let alone this often. I'm just frustrated at this point becasue I seems like a bad luck curse. What the hell is wrong with me? Also, god bless narcan but I hate that shit. Using a throwaway becasue I need to vent, but fuck even my dope friends would judge me for being so dumb.",1462288291.0

I've been on and off of them long before I started using opiates, and they've helped me in the past. I've been thinking about going on them for a while while I get off of my pod tea habit, seem to flip between take them and not take them daily. Currently I've decided not to take them and try to change my life in positive ways, you know, exercise, eating right, mindfulness, in an attempt to affect my outlook for the better. I am however, pretty terrible at this, but I will try once more at least. I worry sometimes about the intense states of despair I find myself in during withdrawal, but I don't think I'm really at risk of suicide. Of course I've heard of how quickly thinking about it can turn to action, so I'm a little apprehensive, but I think I can manage without killing myself at least, even if it doesn't always feel like it.

I need to be on my game tomorrow as best as possible because I have an exam the next evening that I've done jack shit for, so I'll need to cram like crazy and go to work as well where we're all under a massive time crunch to get shit done for a paper to resubmit for publishing.  My connect says she's good to meet sometime tomorrow, but there's a good chance it won't be until late at night.  For tomorrow, I have:

100 mg adderall

a big box of loperamide

more than enough xanax

about ~.7 g ketamine

and plenty of DXM

What would be the best combo if it turns out I have to wait until midnight to reup?  I start getting sick after about 6-8 hours and am basically 100% useless after that point.  Worst case scenario, I get the shit at midnight and have to pull an all-nighter, but I'd rather not since my sleep schedule is already supremely fucked.  And yes, I've read the full wd survival guide in detail, but just want input on best combo of what I have available.

Also possibly relevant: the class is some blowoff graduation requirement I'm fulfilling through a gender studies class, so I need to skim like four to five weeks of readings and identify main themes in short essays and match passages to authors, so it isn't like the typical STEM class studying I'm used to and rather just 100% memorization - hence the emphasis on adderall, which I have not tolerance to at the moment and very little to any of the others besides dope.

But there's a species called Papaver rhoeas - the ""red poppy"" - which is grown for ornamental purposes and used for wartime remembrance. These poppies do not produce opiate alkaloids and grow like weeds. The Papaver somniferum that I have seen are usually blue, white, purple, or some variation thereof. There are other differences between P. rhoeas and P. somniferum, but the color is the most obvious one. EDIT: also, after the petals fall off, P. somniferum are fat and round, but P. rhoeas are longer and more narrow. Those fat little opium balls are making me horny just thinking about them.

But my question is this: are there red P. somniferum/opium poppies? Or even yellow or orange, like the ""California poppy"" (different genus, IIRC)? Or, when people post pictures of beautiful fields of red flowers, would they be sadly mistaken upon trying to get high off them?

Related story: in high school I discovered that poppies grew all over my town like weeds, so I went around collecting them at night and tried every which way to get high on them. I even found a field of them that I harvested ""opium latex"" from. Turns out all of them where P. rhoeas. All I got was a wicked headache and a little gastrointestinal upset from all the nasty plant matter. Also, it tasted like ass. Not as bad as kratom, but still...ass.

Related story 2: in high school, after I realized that poppies can grow like weeds and that P. rhoeas doesn't get you high - AND after realizing that poppy seed tea works and that grocery store poppy seeds are opium poppies - I put two and two together and spent one glorious spring and summer as ""Johnny Poppyseed"". I replaced all the deceptive, disgusting P. rhoeas growing around like weeds with P. somniferum, which ALSO grew like weeds. I got ripped off my tits for a couple months and spent an entire summer wasted 24/7 on my own home-grown (or town-grown, as it were) opium. God that was glorious.

Talking to some friends back home and googling up finding a dealer alternatives led me to a piqued interest in what they call poppy seed tea. 

I'm incredibly skeptical of anything legal, nothing has done anything for me (kratom, kava, etc.), ever. Not of the opiate variety anyway, salvia done right is serious and I'm sure there are others. If it wasn't coming from my boy I used to get high with and whose opinion I trusted there's no chance I would have even given it a shot.

I checked through some posts here and elsewhere, picked a vendor that looked legit and ordered up 2 pounds of the little fuckers. I used the apparently consensus method of funneling into a 2 liter bottle, adding some lemon juice and enough water to cover the seeds. Shook the shit out of it for 5 minutes then unscrewed the cap a little bit and squeezed that shit into a solo cup.

The brown skim milk lookin shit just about filled the solo cup. It doesn't taste good. The very first little sip I took i thought for a second that it wasn't awful. It was, awful. I just put it down, drank it all real quick. Almost puked towards the end but it got down. 

20 minutes later, holy shit. Shit is no joke. I'm completely blown away at how strong this is and shits got legss. I drank it like 6 hours ago and am still feelin real nice. I honestly prefer this to a couple ms 80s, which is kinda what it reminds me of, just better. It's definitely a heavier high than dope, oxy or hydro, but still very good.

Just figured I'd share. Find a good vendor and order some up. It's incredibly easy to do, outside of the actual drinking part but it's worth sucking it up and getting down those 16 ounces or so.

Just think, as us junkies constantly struggle to live something that vaguely resembles a normal life, paying bills, minding our families, fighting to fit in with the constant hum and drum of the mindless office drones life is happening all around us. The drugs we do don't define who we are, they don't own us, man. They're just the buttercream icing on our fucking birthday cake.  
    

Nobody is special like that, not in their own right, not better, not worse, we're all bags of rotting meat destined for that long dirt nap, and if anyone thinks they're an exception to one of lifes ultimate truths, they're dead wrong. What happens between now and then is irrelevant. How you get there? That's between you and God...not your neighbor, nor Johnny law, and certainly not some judgemental nobs on the internet. Morality can be an iffy thing, but who is anyone to decide what is right or wrong for you...and, you know what I mean, we're talking about a little dope or some pipe weed, not murder or fucking your best friends wife, or even worse, your sister!   
    

While Jack and Sally in accounting are up there doing whatever the fuck it is they do with their calculators we're down here toiling away like Santa's secret elvises to feed that God damned monkey on our backs. Us junkies are a lot of things, but lazy is not one of them. Whether or not mainstream society agrees with us or not we're here to stay, there's a method to our madness. In the grand sea of chaos and  piles of human shit, here we are, seeking out our own path.  
    

I don't know where I'm going with this, all I'm really trying to say...is what fuckin' difference does it make. I mean, really, life isn't that hard. Hell,  you can try to live by the ten commandments, the golden rule,  honor among thieves, way of the samurai...whatever, just don't take life so serious. Keep it simple honor your family, and try not to be a piece of shit, and if you do decide to start fucking up, keep the casualties and innocent bystanders to a minimum, don't involve other people in your shitfest.

He has been out of jail for about 2 weeks and has moved to Atlanta and is at a place called Sober Living America. Almost immediately, I saw and heard of things that were very alarming. Namely that after being there for less than a week, my brother is leading groups and classes and his girlfriend is the ""intake director"". Both of them were heavy heroin users only months ago (even less in the girlfriend's case) and now they are in charge of helping / teaching others when they can't even help themselves?

It also seems like they send the attractive women that are staying there into the jails to ""recruit"" (lure) inmates with drug problems into their facility after they are released. However, it doesn't seem like the people who stay there are getting any actual help... They are just being given a false sense of accomplishment thru phony titles and positions and are crammed into dingy apartments paying $750/month for next to nothing. 

I've done some of my own research on this company and have found multiple reports of sexual assaults, theft by employees and drugs being easily available to those who are having sex with the higher ups.

After the no children for the general man law was enacted the commoners turned to opiates to keep their sex drives down. Everyone knows the punishment for breaking the new law, bring someone into this world and you must leave. There is no more room. We all must make sacrifices.

When the ocean started swallowing the land little by little we all panicked. Now we know it's just how things are going to be, houses being built up in the new cities are no longer made from lumber and built to last. The new dwellings are resemble the slums of the old days. We all know this city too will soon be swallowed.

The heat is unbearable, but it provides wonderful conditions for the poppy. All through the Sun belt, from Arizona and well into Texas, the Red Blooms signify our collective misery. When I took my last flight, which was actually one of the last operating flight for us commoners, it provided a beautiful sight. I thought maybe things would be better out west but it's all the same everywhere. Fortunately the New government knew our misery and subsidized the poppy so that we could comfortably adjust to this new life. 

All through the world the stories are heart breaking. The news have stopped reported on the mass migrations and genocides.

I was beaten down and accepting of death. I chose to go to rehab voluntarily because I figured that I could get off the streets for the time being, I wouldn't have to focus all my time and money on drugs, and my family wouldn't have to grieve because I would have overdosed by the end of the week that I went in. So, I stepped up and got into treatment and stayed for 32 days, I contemplated leaving so many fucking times but I didn't. I don't know what stopped me from leaving. 

But now since I've been out, I've been obsessing hard about using again and putting a needle in my arm. I don't have a car and the few times that I have gotten money, I don't have the opportunity to pick up. I don't have any of my gear because they took it away when I went inside. 

I don't know what I'm trying to say. I guess that I know that I have an issue but has anyone gotten clean and then been able to chip successfully? I'm worried about relapsing but I'm also not... because I feel like I can handle things better this time around. Which is a horrible mindset to have. I'm stuck between wanting to stay clean and just wanting one more shot. I've been having horrible dreams and fantasies about using.

Just spent 30 days in an amazing inpatient rehab and now in a recovery house and IOP. I'm doing great and loving being free of the chains of addiction. It's great to wake up and not have to worry about being sick or finding my next bundle (or 5). And I love being able to laugh again. And orgasm. And eat 3 meals a day. And many more things.

Anyway, for those that know me, I didn't stop posting bc I'm dead, I'm just gettin busy livin. Hopefully I'm still singin the same tune a month from now and so on.

Love y'all and see you TCers soon ;)

EDIT: Also, did vivitrol this time. No side effects. Not sure where all the hate comes from.

Anyway, my mom and my girlfriend are drinkers. My gf is not as heavy of a drinker/pot smoker anymore bc of all the talks we've had but she would do it under the excuse of partying. It was pretty obvious to me it wasn't just for partying though. She was also prescribed first Prozac, and then switched to lexapro. That shit was awful, it amplified her thoughts of suicide and she gained a lot of weight which added to her sadness. 

My mom drinks cosmos every night and takes Prozac. Her marriage with my dad has been really chaotic over the past couple years and that's when she started the drinking and Prozac. She justifies the drinking with the classic ""I only drink at night, never during the day"" bs. 

Both my mom and gf gave me a lot of shit for using heroin. My gf left me until I got clean and my mom wouldn't talk to me until I got clean. Like I said, I obviously shouldn't use heroin. But I was just wondering if anyone else has experience with hypocrisy like that. I think SSRIs are dangerous and there's really no evidence that it works and it has awful side effects.

I have to say, I have been *much* sicker with the flu, than I ever was with opiate withdrawal. 

But the difference lies in the possessiveness of lady H. When we are addicts, we are enslaved to the drug. It is our #1 top priority, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. (it was for me anyways)

When we try to kick the habit, we become physically ill. (Albeit cruel & unusual punishment for taking a step in the right direction) Now the illness itself is uncomfortable at best, & miserable at worst. Yet, we still manage to function pretty well, all things considered. Therefor, it is not the physical symptoms that are incapacitating us.

The problem is, that lady H is a very possessive, & jealous lover. Even when we are broken up, she is out to make your life miserable. She still wants to be your #1 priority. ""till death do us part"" kind of shit. 

If I had a cold, I would be able to distract/occupy myself enough to be indifferent to my cold. In full blown opiate withdrawal, I am lucky to get  an hour of sleep without her constantly on the front of my mind. She just won't GET OUT OF MY HEAD!

That all, is what I think makes opiate withdrawal unique.

I'm presently on 46mg Methadone and I've got 2 privileges so I get 2 take homes on Friday (but I still have to dose that day in front of the pharmacist.).

It's actually just 1 question but in 3 parts.

1. Do I do as usual and buy a 0.25g bag of the bestest dope I've ever done. Would I even feel it on 46mg Methadone? I know on 60mg of Methadone I felt the rush but not the high that followed :(

2. SHould I do as usual and instead buy 50mg of pretty darn pure of Fentanyl HCL?

3. My question to you guys is should I get some 0.25g of that bestest dope and on Friday drink like half my dose of 46mg (they allow me to do that), and then start using the dope when I can't stand it and keep my 2 take homes for after the binge?

Just trying to get the what's best for my money without too much suffering as I don't have a lot of money right now so I need to make what I'll get go as far or rather get me as high as it can...

Also, any ideas on how to potentiate IV heroin? I've got a bunch of Hydroxyzine and a bunch of Neurontin (Gabapentin)?

I'm basically worried the 46mg Methadone that keeps me almost sane right now might ruin my pleasure week-end. And the reason I'm saying ""keeps me almost sane is I've tapered 14mg in a week so I'm in the throw of some mild/not so mild withdrawals already...

Last night I was cruising around with my friend bumpin' some white, and we're listening to the radio, and land on the station where Nikki Sixx has his own show (the 6th sense with Nikki Sixx)

He brings up the fact that you can buy narcan otc in some states (he didn't even call it narcan he just said ""opiate cure"" or something like that.) He then proceeds to be completely amazed that you can, in his words, ""be strung out on drugs, and walk in and buy this cure"", THEN he goes on to say how completely amazed he is that you can just buy this thing that will end your addiction. He literally thinks that narcan will cure your addiction instantly. Why speak about something publicly when you have no idea what in the fuck you're talking about?

It upset me to hear him spew out misinformation, who knows how many normies will hear that and disregard investing in it to save a loved one who overdoses, because they don't know that it will save them. Plus it might give them even more reason to hate on us, because if we can just buy that and cure our addiction, why don't we? Because we're junkie scum? It just upset me on several levels.

In short it doesnt look good, I realised I'd have to put in 150% to pull out of a nose dive, had a few strategies in mind etc. Then my partner of 8 years, and mother of my child told me shes leaving me. 

She is taking my daughtet, whom I love more than life itself.

I have completely broken down. I dont know what to do. Even getting high feels completely pointless. Saw a doctor and have been put on valium for the endless panic attack that is now my life, and referred to a psych to start the long overdue process of getting my head together. I had a moment of clarity to come clean about my use to my partner, my mum, and my doctor. I am getting a referral to begin the arduous process of inpatient detox. Looks like friday / saturday intake at this rate, so im on a self imposed rapid taper until then. Picking up lope tomorrow to help until I begin. I should mention my DOC is ""only"" PST, but im at around 2 years daily, and im up to ~150 to 250mg of morphine a day. I know its going to hurt. The furthest iv been is about 30 hours between doses and I cave because im weak.

I know my relationship with the woman I love is over, iv spent a quarter of my life with her and I dont know where to begin without her. We may resolve things in time, but id pay that about 5% odds. 
Sorry for the ramble, I just need to get this down. She thinks im having an affair. When in fact the secrecy that has lead to this accusation is solely because of me hiding my use. I feel so pathetic. 

She is so angry that iv been lying to her all this time, but I had to come clean to start the healing process from the bottom, with all my cards on the table. But now, because i told the truth, she doesnt want me to see my daughter and I think this will get messy.

I cant believe its come to this. Im scared to drive my car because every tree, every bridge I think about how quickly I could just go back to sleep.

I have an addiction myself, one that is tearing me apart on the inside. I just can't stop. I think that maybe i am not strong enough, maybe i am just a pussy and cant deal with it, that my life is so rough having an addiction, and than i come here and see how hard life can really be.

I recently(as in, earlier today) interviewed for a pharmacy technician position at a local chain pharmacy, and if I get the job, I know I will be required to take a drug test. I have been a daily opiate user for roughly 6 months but recently decided to call it quits. I usually take 5-7.5mg OxyContin each day before work, and have 5 days a week for the past 6ish months. The last time I used OxyContin was last Friday, I took 30mg as sort of a last ""hurrah"". Since then I have taken 5-10mg of methadone twice(Sunday and today) to help with very slight feelings of WD. I do not plan on using Oxy or any opiate anymore, i'm trying to get clean for myself, not just the test. However my question is, how long will these drugs stay in my system? I have read a lot online, but I know that amount used, frequency of use, weight, metabolism, etc. all contribute to that. For reference, I am 4'9"", 130lbs, long-term daily user, with a slow metabolism.

Basically, i'm wondering roughly how long it should take for these drugs to clear out of my system? Also, are some tips/supplements to take to help speed up the process of getting clean? I also plan on purchasing a few at-home drug tests for peace of mind before the test, what brand/type should I use optimally? Any advice is greatly appreciated, I have never had to take a drug test for my current job and have no experience with any of this.",1462331072.0

I had my first H of this year after going on a long, intentional break.  I only used about a gram of #3 smoked and it took me about a week to go through it, never binging hardcore.  I've been through some pretty bad WDs before, but this of course is nothing.  No RLS, no vomiting, only slightly loose bowels, not even any cold sweats.  But the symptom that most bothers me is the anhedonia.  *Nothing* is fun.  Nothing can keep my attention.  Even something that I normally enjoy and can just use to numb the mind (a good movie) I just can't stand.  The attention span isn't there, and my mind always leads back to how I'm uncomfortable and depressed.  I'm not complaining at all - again, I know I got off LIGHT here.  

My first question is, other than the usual WD helpers like loperamide, do you guys use anything to help lift your spirits?  Increase your attention span or ability to get things done?  (inb4 ""weed!"" - that only makes my attention span worse and adds a little anxiety to the mix).  Especially chippers - does anything help you out of the immediate post-opiate blues?

So here is where the title comes in.  I've got a fair amount of LSD.  I have never used it before but have used shrooms, lots of salvia, peyote (from the church!) and MXE.  I've also been reading about the mood enhancing effects of MICROdosing LSD (10-20ug) and wondered if this would help me get through the next few tough days now that my Golden Brown has left for a while again.  Any opiate users experienced with LSD?  Or more to the point, with microdosing it?  I am highly considering experimenting, but I have a few fears.

* Since it's my first time with LSD, taking it while in a low mental space may make for a bad experience, even if it is a tiny dose without visuals.
* *If* it is a bad experience, I don't want it to negatively ""color"" my future experience when I really do trip (regular dose, like 110ug or more)
* I want some relief from this wet blanket of ennui. I do not want to worsen it.
* My research indicates that LSD and opiates are a physically safe combo, but I don't want to fuck myself up.  

So, a Tl;dr.... might it be helpful to MICROdose LSD to ease very mild WD symptoms or is this stupid?  If it's the latter, try not to be *too harsh*... I'm not feelin' good!  ",1462315068.0

then sometime in late 2014 i snorted some opana for the first time and was blown away, never had i experienced something as pleasant as this. ever since then i've pretty much snorted opana every day since then and i can't function without them. i usually snort at least 7.5 mgs twice a day otherwise the withdrawals will start kicking in. i lost my job not too long ago so it's been rough trying to get money for it because a 15 mg moon here goes for fucking $60, which i know is highway fucking robbery, but thats how it is here.

anyway i guess the point of this is i really want to fucking quit but i can't even go a damn day without some opana without experiencing withdrawals. my friend gave me 2 suboxone strips to try and help but i didn't feel them at all, which is strange because i took subs before i was addicted to OPs and got really fucked up but now when i tried to take them as intended i didnt feel a thing, same thing with methadone. 

i just really don't know what i'm going to do at this point. i've thought about going to the methadone clinics but i currently have no job or health insurance. i know i can get a job easily but there's just no way i'll be able to work while i'm sober.

so i guess what do you guys recommend to help with WDs? my friend linked me to some poppy seeds that i can use to make tea with that will supposedly work wonders. i've thought about going back to hydros/oxys since i never experienced WDs on them but of course my tolerance has sky rocketed since then. i used to take 20/30 mg of some tabs and feel good but now i would probably have to take 70-100 mg to even feel anything and at that point i would be spending way more money on tabs than on the OPs.

sorry for the long post, just want to get off my chest what i think about every single day. i absolutely don't want to continue this lifestyle but it feels like everything i try just doesn't work. i tried going cold turkey a few days ago and i honestly felt like i was going to go into shock... ugh. i could seriously shoot myself for getting addicted to this shit :/",1462314660.0

I mean, I knew he used as well as he knows I use, (it's always been our little sibling secret) but I guess I never realized how bad he was getting. I fault myself for not teaching him to CWE, but he is so stubborn he wouldn't have listened anyway. So his kidneys started failing, then he started vomiting blood, and that's when I took him to the ER. They admitted him right away and about an hour later he aspirated on his own vomit, and now he has pneumonia and lung damage.

2. Consistency- blue breaks easy and seems to go into powder where as the green clean breaks into 2 maybe 3 pieces
3. Sheen- green has a sheen that can be seen from an angle, blue doesn't seem to have that sheen.

I would also like to know if it's worth the price in terms of quality: euphoria, legs, etc.  Is #4 that much better?  If I go through a gram of pretty decent quality #3 in 5 days smoking (I'm fairly good at keeping my tolly low), will good quality #4 keep me as high on a gram for a whole week?  Longer?  

How does smoking #3 compare to snorting #4 in terms of legs?  I get a nice rush chasing that dragon and then a few hours of that lovely warm chill-out you all know.  Can I expect the same putting #4 up my nose?  I'm sure it depends on quality, but just assuming the quality is top shelf or between mid and top shelf, is it a pretty even comparison?

Honestly, I want everyone to tell me how much better #4 is so that I feel better about spending more money because I'm impatient.  I'd love to hear #4 is well worth 3x the price I usually pay for the same amount of #3, but I want honest answers.  Should I just wait another two weeks and stick with my cost effective habit or should I venture out into the HCL realm?",1462299542.0

I've been on methadone for 2 months now as part of an opioid replacement therapy program. 
I've been stable at 90 milligrams/day for 5 weeks. 
I decided to make the switch to Suboxone upon the advice of my doctor for 2 reasons:

1. Methadone has me feeling exhausted all the time. Prior to starting methadone I was working out at the gym 5-6 times per week. Now I struggle to make it 3-4 times and even then my workouts are not great. It makes me sleep a stupid amount of time, I still feel tired after sleeping 9-10 hours. If I don't set an alarm, I can easily sleep 12-14 hours.

2. Methadone is notoriously hard to get off. Most people on this program stay on it for years (or the rest of their lives).


I wish I would've chosen Suboxone when I began the program but at the time I wasn't quite ready to give up my habit. 
The main reasons I began the program were to appease my girlfriend and to stop blowing money on dope everyday.
However, I am now in a place to give my all to recovery.


Game Plan:

Starting today (Tuesday), my doctor will decrease my dose by 10 milligrams/day to reach a target dose of 40 milligrams/day for Saturday and Sunday. 

I will take my last methadone dose on Sunday at 11AM.

Monday will be my biggest challenge as I battle withdrawals. 
I'm hoping to take some Xanax, smoke some weed, and sleep most of the day.

Next Tuesday at 9AM I will go to the clinic and begin dosing Suboxone. 
I will be dosed several times that day until I am stable.


I've acquired 15 x 4mg Dilaudid (hydromorphone) to take some of the edge off being on a low methadone dose on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. 
I will not take any after 9PM on Sunday night to avoid precipitated withdrawals.


I've taken next Monday to Wednesday off work and cleared my weekend of most obligations.
However, I'm obligated to go to a friend's birthday party on Saturday, though it may end up being just a quick visit depending on how I am feeling. 
I'm hoping the Dilaudids will help in this situation.


Have any of you been through this before? Any advice for me? How can I make the best use of my Dilaudids?

**EDIT:** Thanks for all of the responses. Most of them were quite discouraging. However, if I want to switch from methadone to Suboxone, I have to follow my doctor's plan. I don't really have any choice other than backing out and staying on methadone. I guess it's in fate's hands now, hopefully luck is on my side. Maybe I'm in the small percentile of people who do not experience PWDs... I will give an update next Tuesday or Wednesday detailing my experience for the curious and anyone who comes across this post in the future. In the mean time, please send me your positive vibes!

**EDIT 2:** I talked to the pharmacist about my concerns. He said that he has never seen a problem with someone on 40 mg/day of methadone transitioning to Suboxone. However, as many of you pointed out, I will not truly be at 40 mg/day due to the rapid-taper. Last night (and this morning), I could already feel the results of my reduction from 90 mg/day to 80 mg/day; I was very edgy and didn't sleep much. Based on this, the pharmacist said that I likely have a much higher than normal metabolism since it is quite unusual to feel the effects of the reduction that quickly, which may end up being my saving grace. He indicated that my doctor probably took this into account when coming up with my game plan, as he would've observed the consequences of my higher metabolism during induction. The pharmacist said that if I'm really worried, I can skip my Sunday dose (or reduce it to 20 mg) though an additional day without methadone after such a rapid-taper may be pretty rough. I am aiming to do cardio every day up until Tuesday to keep my metabolism high. As well, I am going to talk to my doctor tomorrow about potentially skipping my Sunday dose. The pharmacist also said that the clinic will administer the [COWS checklist](http://www.naabt.org/documents/cows_induction_flow_sheet.pdf) before dosing me with Suboxone, which should help prevent PWDs.

**EDIT 3:** When I received my methadone dose today, I actually felt mild euphoria, which I haven't felt since stabilizing. In prior experience (with other opiates), I've found that the high felt much better if I was in withdrawal when dosed. Hopefully this is another indication of a high metabolism.

**EDIT 4:** I talked to the nurse who will be dosing me with Suboxone about my concerns. She agreed that it would be a good idea for me to skip my Sunday dose if I am up to it. Therefore, I am going to save most of the Dilaudid for Sunday and skip my methadone dose. As well I am going to take my Saturday dose as early as possible.

**EDIT 5:** After a difficult week I have finally made my switch to Suboxone! Fortunately, I avoided PWDs, which may be due to taking the extra day off methadone, I guess we will never know. My induction consisted of 3 doses of 4 mg, I am feeling pretty decent at 12 mg but may be increased to 14 mg or 16 mg tomorrow. Thanks for the warnings and support, much appreciated. 

On a side note, I don't know how I would've done this without the Dilaudid and Xanax. It's quite unfortunate that I had to acquire these myself, rather than being prescribed by the doctor. I suppose it makes sense though as I'm sure some of you (or my past self) wouldn't have been able to resist using all of it at once.

**EDIT 6:** I was increased to 16 mg on the second day as 12 mg did not take me all the way out of withdrawal. Increased again to 20 mg on the third day as 16 mg started to wear off in the late evening. 

Getting used to Suboxone has been much tougher than I anticipated. I thought that once I was through my abstinence period and onto Suboxone I would be stable. However, even with the Suboxone, kicking methadone is proving to be quite a roller coaster. I'd originally only booked off Monday through Wednesday from work, luckily I was able to extend it to the end of the week without much trouble. I can't imagine having to go to work in my current state.

Suboxone takes away the physical withdrawals but does nothing for my psychological cravings, since starting it I've been experiencing stronger cravings than I've felt in months. I suppose that is because I was still getting a high from the methadone, though it felt insignificant compared to my opioid(s) of choice. I definitely would've caved if not for the fact that its not possible to get high while on Suboxone. Now I understand why methadone is so much harder than Suboxone for people to quit. I always thought it was because methadone caused severe and lengthy physical withdrawals compared to Suboxone but now I realize its because methadone is still a full agonist and as such still provides opioid ""benefits"", though not as strongly as others, which Suboxone is lacking as buprenorphine is only a partial agonist. I can't imagine doing a long taper on methadone, I would definitely relapse, I guess that's why a large percentage of people on methadone stay on it for a long period of time or never quit. Going on methadone is just swapping your opioid(s) of choice for a cheaper one from a more reliable dealer (the pharmacy). It's definitely better than being an all out junkie, but if your goal is to completely clean, with no dependence on anything, I'd stay away from methadone. 

Another difficulty with the switch has been sleeping. I should've anticipated this since one of the main reasons I made the switch was because methadone was making me feel exhausted all the time. Now I am having the opposite problem. Even though I was so tired last night I had to force myself to try to go to sleep and even then I could only sleep a couple of hours. I guess I'm just used to passing out (and staying out) from the methadone, hopefully my sleep cycle returns to normal soon.

**EDIT 7:** Tomorrow will be one week on Suboxone. After a bumpy start I'm finally feeling normal, cravings become duller each day and I'm able to sleep (as long as I'm actually tired that is, like normal folks I suppose). I have so much more energy than when on methadone, my workouts seem to be improving and, yesterday, I worked on my house all day and had the most productive day I've had in months. I'm playing my first hockey game since the switch tonight, I'm betting I'll have my best game of the season. This switch has definitely been worthwhile!

**EDIT 8:** As of yesterday, I've been on Suboxone for two weeks. The two weekends during this time have been the most productive since I started on methadone, maybe even since my relapse. I've been getting to tasks that have been outstanding for months and months, my house has never been so clean! Tapering down has been easy, I don't feel it like I felt when decreasing methadone. I started at 20 mg/day, I'm already down to 12 mg/day, and will decrease again to 8 mg/day next week. If anyone is thinking about making the switch, it is painful but so worth it!",1462297010.0

A few months (I honestly don't remember 100%)ago I posted here about my dad using. Now, if you check my post history, you'll know I'm not stranger to drugs. Even opiates to an extent. I just wish he would at least get clean long enough to get a job and a stable environment where he can use and be safe, etc... but he's just, lazy and unmotivated. He says dope makes him more motivated but all it does is make him sit and nod off. I know he's using because track marks, pinned pupils, nodding off any and every where and I've seen needles, burned spoons and things commonly used to shoot. I'm worried about him and I've seen him spend 4 hours in the bathroom with the sink faucet running and then he gets out and can hardly hold himself up, he can't walk right and he's barely breathing. 

Right after I made the first post a while ago he quit and I watched for a month as he went through hell in WDs and he fought through it and I couldn't have been more proud. He kicked it for a while but not even 2 weeks later he was using everyday, multiple times a day and I can't watch him do this anymore. 

Should I give up or what? My anxiety is at an all time high because he's almost ODd so many times and he will come home from getting his dope and have marks and scratches and shit all over him. Like, 2 weeks ago he came home and told me he got pistol whipped and there is a scar on his forehead go prove it. I just don't know what to do :/",1462296934.0

I'm hoping that since I take less than my prescribed amount (45-90 mgs- it varies from month to month-prescribed 120 mg per day) that it might be a little easier. I know in the end I don't want to be on these meds but I really can't make it through most days without them and the days I feel like I can I'm scared to not take it. Can anyone speak from experience to their withdrawl going from a relatively small amount to clean?

I found this [chart](https://www.atrainceu.com/course-module/1473366-70_opioids-their-use-and-abuse-module) showing what opiates hit what receptors. It shows that Bupe is a Mu Agonist, and a Kappa Antagonist. Can someone clarify for me: does that mean that by activating the Mu receptor, it keeps you from being sick, and by blocking the kappa receptor, it prevents you from getting high on other opiates? Or is the blocking ability a result of high affinity for the Mu receptor? People usually just say it ""fills the receptors"" but they don't specify which receptors result in its blocking ability. According to that paragraph above the chart, the Kappa receptor rarely leads to dependence, yet that is the receptor bupe is an antagonist for; any insight into that?  


Secondly, if you were looking for an opiate to switch to, in order to keep you straight while you let the long half life of bupe run its course, which would be the ideal opiate to use, given the varying receptor activities? Based on that chart, it looks like Codeine would be the best, as it has the weakest effect across all receptors. If there was a receptor that hit only Kappa and Delta, that but not Mu, it seems like that would be ideal, but I dont see one on that chart. The other two partial mixed agonists above Buprenorphine look interesting, but as i've never heard of them before, i'd imagine they're hard to get.

I was 17 when I got into pills hardcore but first started playing with them at 15.
I first did heroin when I was 16- started doing it daily at 19. Started shooting a year ago when I was 20- going on 21. 

It may seem silly but I'm really curious to know what age groups this sub consists of. Also it would be interesting to know how old everyone was when they started doing it and when they got addicted. Feel free to add your story of how you got hooked, or just your ages if you want, up to you. 
Hope to get a bunch of comments!

Please help.,"I am hoping this community can do me a favor and help me understand this whole addiction thing a little bit better. 

My boyfriend is a recovering heroin addict's who is on Suboxone. He has recently admitted that sometimes he skips his Suboxone dose so that he can get high on heroin. I am not OK with this and he has told me that he is willing to stop with the heroin - as I do believe he wants to stop.

The only problem is that he is an addict and I understand addiction well enough to know that it is a powerful disease and addicts are prone to lie and cheat the system. He tells me that because of the Suboxone he cannot get high for up to 24 hours before or after taking one. If he has used Suboxone night before and then takes a pill 12 hours later in the morning it will cause precipitated withdrawal and make him very sick. 

Even if he hasn't used before he takes the Suboxone, he pretty much cannot use heroin for the next 24 hours because the Suboxone blocks heroin for at least the next 12 hours but it has a blocking the fact that lasts more like up to 36 hours.b so if I see him his 8mg of Suboxone, is it safe to assume that he is probably not able to use heroin on top of that?",1462397209.0

Has anyone ever heard that the only way for an undercover to make an arrest for the sale is if they visibly witness the deal go down? Like if they're waiting in a car down the road and then make the bust after a CI does the deal, it wouldn't hold up in court?

Also in my town in New York, the cops will never arrest you or raid your house after the CI makes a buy. They will just put out a warrant for your arrest and then wait for you to get pulled over. But not sure how they get your full name, DOB, and other info to actually write the warrant. Obviously a CI wouldn't have that kind of info on you unless they were super close to you. How the hell do they get that info?

In my town, the county judge was the DA for 10 years prior. So he has no problem handing out 3-9 years on low level drug charges. It's a fucking joke.

So I *do* know opiates are metabolized in 3 steps, containing two phases. 

* There's ""first pass"" metabolism in the liver, which breaks down a big chunk of an opiate by simply filtering it away. 

* Phase I Modification, where I understand Cytochrome P450 plays a big role, especially in regards to CYP2D6 (Codeine) and CYP34A( morphine). This can infamously be blocked by grapefruit juice, which will live forever in our Potentiation Hall of Fame. 

* Phase II Conjugation metabolism is where enzymes catalyze morphine or codeine into essentially bonding with glucuronides or sulf-o-somethings. Ultimately after this they 99% get pissed out of the body because even though they are slightly lipophiliac, they are highly hydrophiliac. But here is where I kinda start to lose it and I don't understand. 

So there are a few drugs and naturally occurring compounds out there that both inhibit and induce Phase II metabolism. My question is, would we want this? For example, I'd think if we inhibited conjugation, that means more (pure example) Morphine in the body longer, as opposed to it getting turned into Morphine-3-glucuronide faster and eventually sent to the bladder by the kidneys, out of circulation...

 Yet when I read stuff like: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeine#Pharmacokinetics
""Doctor Tebbet speculates that Codeine-6-Glucuronide is responsible for most of Codeine's analgesic effects"" (second line down from top). So I'm confused over whether or not we do or don't want to encourage conjugation. 

To make things more confusing, I've been told that Morphine, Codeine, and Tramadol all have their own different sets of ways you do or don't want to push their buttons (potentiate) in both Phase I *and* Phase II and now I'm totally lost. 

Can someone smarter than myself at chemistry please help explain this to me?

I've noticed that he keeps going up into the boiler room lately.  There is NO reason for him to go up there - absolutely none.

So I have an extensive history of opiate use as well as runs on suboxone. I'm currently on 4 mg of suboxone daily and have been for about 6 months. A couple weeks ago I started feeling that old familiar itch that only a shot can scratch, so I started halving my sub dose then skipped it altogether for a day and got some dope last Thursday. It was okay, but I didn't feel the full high, plus I had to drive way far to obtain a rig and didn't feel like it so I snorted it. Friday I got a rig and more dope, figuring by then I could feel a full high, but all it did was give me a rush so strong I thought for sure I was going down then a ton of nausea and a massive headache. I spent most of Friday and Saturday feeling that way (I did the rest of it of course because hey, why not) and it pretty much sucked. I was debating getting some more on Sunday since it had been about 18 hours since my last shot but found out I have to drop on Friday so I decided against it and went back on my subs once I started to feel sick. It's Wednesday now and I still feel like shit. Achey, irritable, headache, shaky.

Recently I was given a clean bill of health (yay!!) but I'm in a little bit of financial trouble so I sold the last of my script to be able to live and to help my house.

What this means, is that I put myself into a fairly heavy duty withdrawal. Day one was OK, day two which was yesterday was really bad. I couldn't stop pacing my house, I couldn't stop crying. The stomach issues weren't that bad because I took about six tablets of lope. In the afternoon when I couldn't handle it anymore I went to my pharmacy and I picked up a bottle of 8 mg codeine and caffein pills with acetaminophen. I came home and did a CWE, drank it and felt a little bit better but that put me into a spiral where I thought I would totally reset everything and I started to have a bad anxiety attack.

It got so bad I went to the hospital where they gave me two 1 mg tablets of Ativan.

I know they say that the third day is always the worst, but will those 20 CWE pills completely reset me?

4i4hey,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4i4hey/cognitive_dissonance_on_suboxone/,16,https://redd.it/4i4hey,tweekytrap,Cognitive Dissonance on Suboxone,"For the first time in my history as a junkie, I've given opiate replacement a shot.  After using 1.5ish grams of tar a day, I was put on 16mg of suboxone (8mg 2/day). No withdrawal, no weeks-long detox inpatient, no more expensive heroin! Yay!

Nope.

At first, I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't find the dose to kill me, but after my second shot at that, I let that temptation pass.  After the first week, things started to get...funky..?  Initially, it was difficulty in concentration, random loss of visual focus, but then things went down hill pretty quickly.  I started sleepwalking, I've been plagued by night terrors that wake me up every couple hours or leave me in a paralytic delirium until my consciousness adjusts to the idea that breathing just isn't a thing it controls anymore.  During the day, after I take a dose, my thoughts eschew and sometimes I catch myself having been lost in, ""thought."" while I've been mindlessly muttering nonsense to myself. Normal human interactions have taken on a strange character and I'm not sure that's because weed's legal in my state or things are getting weird somewhere in my skull.  

My ability to chose proper wording in a sentence is sometimes occasionally halted completely.  I'll get stuck, as if the thought I'd intended to put to lip was gone from my mind.  It's there, tip of the tongue, but unable to materialize.  Sometimes my vision gets so blurry I can barely see all but a few inches from my face while a migraine set in.  It doesn't seem like this is a common side effect, but I'm always curious what people describe in medical trials as, ""confusion.""  Fuck if I know, maybe they're actually tripping balls and there's only so many possible boxes to check.

I've reduced my dose to 2mg daily and have been at this dose for a couple weeks.  All in all, I've been in the program for a couple months and all this month I've been between 6mg-2mg/day (total).  I took 8mg last night to see if anything happened. No-go, I wasn't even lightly stoned, no change in the, ""weird"" feeling, but today was a total clusterfuck of confusion.  I was taking to my doctor (general doc) about an upcoming surgery and couldn't get the words out, this is now actively affecting my functioning.  I read for pleasure and I can barely get through a paragraph without going back and re-reading it. My sleepwalking is getting so bad, I've hidden a laptop, a phone and two books from myself. I've sleep-walked before, not like this. It's kind of frightening that I'm doing things without my knowledge.

If you've felt this way before or any of these symptoms resound for you, let me know what worked for you.  I want to keep with the program, I've known it to work for so many people, but I just can't handle this anymore.  I need my mind and senses back.. I need to stop sleepwalking before I sell the farm out from under me.  I've never had a feel like this before, maybe the closest sensation is sleep deprivation, but I can't.... I just can't handle this anymore, I'm fucking losing it.. 

TL;DR:  Has anyone felt disorientation or delirium from suboxone before?  What worked for you to abate the symptoms? ",1462529733.0

It further highlights the world that I inhabit though. The only decent person in the whole of todays' ordeal was a dealer. What's going on? Wacky Wednesday, Opposite Monday?
  
  


And so begins a typical day. I get the sleep I can, but I'm woken not by an alarm or the sunlight streaming through the windows or the birds chirping. It's the beginning of the sickness. I'm beginning to overheat. My face is getting greasy and I've got to perfom all of the pleasantries with the people I live with before leaving the house and scoring, which, thankfully, I've cut down enough so that I get around 24 hours until the next sickness. So the routine is always the same.
  
  

I call my regular girl. For the first time in 3 days she picks up. 'Yo. I AINT GOT NUTHIN'. Are you going to town yourself? I ask. 'Yeah. I'll call you when I do'.
  
  

She uses herself and she supports that by selling. But if she can't get larger amounts then she has to hit the town and buy individual bags for herself. I've spent virtually every single day for more than 2 years getting up and going to her. She drives, but never delivers, never lets me know when she's near or coming past my area. No service, no compassion.
  

  

She knows (and I've said it outright) that I'll go back to her as soon as she's holding again but she won't hook me up with someone else when she's got nothing to sell. I wish I could get rid of her but finding new numbers has been a complete failure this year - except for this week, for some reason. (I posted a couple days ago about a new number, but as you'll read on to discover, its virtually useless)
  
  

So, she claims she's going to town and will call me. Oh, she'll go to town and score alright. Just not for me. She won't call. She never does. 

[ I'm actually typing this up at 9pm after the day is over and surprise.. she didn't call 
But I know she's at home, cosy in bed, filled with a warm glow she got for herself while her customers all melt into their own sweaty desperation, depression and pain.]
  
  

She keeps me ill until she's in stock again, she won't even take my money to get me a single shot when she's going herself. I know not to expect a call back and I know I get one call a day. if I call again within 5 hours to check, I'll get screamed at down the phone for 'CONSTANTLY CALLING.' 
  

  

Even after all the time I spent fixing her computers, unlocking her stolen phones, returning stolen items to places she is too well known at to get stolen item refunds... all trying to build up favours and some sort of basic relationship in order to be able to ask for a little help (that doesn't even cost her) when I'm desperate. It's all been for nothing. She hasn't even even ticked me a single shot - even if I can pay within a couple of hours, not even days. Its all for nothing. She's a selfish bitch that sells to get hers and won't hook me up with one else when she's out.
  
  

So, she's not selling today. Thats 3 days with a shortage at my end of town. I posted 2 days ago where I met someone who was struggling and did the old classic - do for me and I'll do for you. She gave me her guys number but he won't serve me unless she's with me. 
  

  

Half is better than nothing. I have a daily budget (not set by me! I have a small daily food allowance that sweeps into my account at midnight, suffice to say it doesn't go on food).

Half.. well.. I wiped the sweat from my brow. It's going to have to do. I called. Her phone didn't even go to voicemail - disconnected number? I called and changed my outgoing number to 'hidden' and then from an entirely different number. Paranoid me just checking I haven't upset her and been blocked, or perhaps she thought I was police...
  

  

Sadly, because I clean my teeth (most days that is, if I haven't nodded into a sink) and I shower every day and try not to dress like a street bum - I find scoring in rougher areas can be difficult. I'm accused literally of being 'too posh' to do gear. I have to employ my best rehearsed rudeboi accent most of the time. 
  

  


Nope.. Number disconnected. She was a real nice girl too, we shared some war stories while waiting. I'm worried she's oaky, but gotta move on.
  

  


So I got the bus straight to the centre of the roughest part of the city. The homeless began to appear on every other street, then to every street and finally to entire shop fronts with people sitting outside begging. The bus stopped. I got off and immediately walked into a real-life deal going down right at the stop. So, I brazenly cut right in and just asked.
  

  


The guy buying and the guy selling both turn round and in unison shout.. ""Fuck off!"" 
""You a fed mothafucka!"" says the guy selling (the one not sweating with jeans and a tracksuit full of holes. Definitely the seller)
  

  


I protest, but he takes a run and shoves me over hard before they both turn around and head to an alley. I pick myself up off the floor and take a walk. I come up to a bench and take a seat. The panic slowly sets in, I begin to assess my options and decide Lope is my best bet short term. As I'm about to stand and head to the nearest pharmacy the seller-guy comes back from the alley and heads toward me 'yo whatcha want?'.  He produces a standard wrapped shot in his hand, I gave him the money. 
  

  


Anyone care to guess where this is going ?
  

  


I don't care we are in public, scammers count on that to give them time to flee, so I immediately open it and gaze down upon my newly purchased cigerette filter wrapped in plastic. 
  

  


There. All my money for the day. No. NO!! I can't have that. I run around, down the alley and find him finishing up the original deal with the earlier buyer. 'A Fucking Stinger!!' I scream. Give me my fucking money you fucking asshole!!' Without warning, backup comes out of nowhere. Possibly a nearby car. Two other taller dudes looking ready to bring the smackdown. The other buyer clocks what I said and rips open one of his bags and he's been had too. We look at each other and begin advancing but get blocked by this mob, some shoving starts - a fist flies, some off balance moves. I have my laptop bag over my shoulder (where I hide my works) and weigh up the losing of the laptop, gaining a black eye and some cracked ribs against the loss of a single bag. It's a tight decision because I know how I'm about to feel in an hour.
  

  


Through the rabble, a car screeches away. The other guys disperse and me and this other idiot are left standing there clueless.
  

  


I get talking to this guy about what the hell we're going to do about the momentarily impending sickness. We arrive at a solution. He has iPods to sell (I don't bother to ask, since it's obvious) and I have photo ID and a pawn shop card. He hands over the goods and I dash over the road and drop them into the pawn shop then return to our park bench. I explain that they have to charge the iPods and check them, and we'll get enough money for 3 bags but it's gonna be an hours wait. 
  

  


While I was haggling prices for the merchandise in the shop, he had decided to open all the fake bags and discovered that he hadn't been burned 100% - he was actually sold 3 bags of ultra strong crack and 2 empty bags of not-heroin?
  

  


Yeah, I'm as confused as you all are right now. So the fucker did sell drugs, just not the ones we wanted and only half ripped this dude off?

At this point I'm thinking - right now, what have I got to lose? 
  

  


""He used my phone and called his regular guy - ""Yo, 10 minutes bruv"" I'm thinking to myself, but the shop said an hour. Do you know you dealer is slow and you're phoning ahead or are you just a crack fiend maniac with no concept of telling people the right time? 
  

  


I asked to be a fly on the wall in a dealers place in a post I made 3 days ago because of the insane time keeping of that day (or complete lack thereof). Well, be careful what you wish for. Me getting myself well hangs in the balance of many things going right. The iPods working, getting the money for them and not seeing a dust trail over the hills and far away in place of this of this lunatic.
  

  


Are you sure they work? I calmly ask.
  

  


That did it..  He launches into a full-on diatribe about his word being his bond / saying what he means and meaning what he says. If he says they work, then rest assured, they fucking work. That's the end of it. He adds at the end that he is insulted I should even ask such a thing and question him as a man of his word.
  

  


I can't wait to get rid of this guy. I've got to get rid of him quick-sharp. He's a goddamn walking liability. After his 'trustworthy man of his word 'speech he pulled out a pipe and literally loaded and began smoking it in plain view of everyone on the busy street, I tried leaning away from him but we just sat there, looking bait in a cloud of crack smoke.  Then his paranoia kicked in. Leaping up and stepping to random people passing and starting fights because they were in his space and looking at him funny. 
  

  



My spider sense was full on spasming, but having not committed to anything yet, and with the last remnants of my own money firmly in my pocket, perhaps I could think of a way of not getting screwed over in the time waiting for the iPods to be checked.
  

  


As he sat back down an equally cracked up no-teeth guy showed up and I'm introduced to his flat mate. Yo, Boo, meet a new 'great friend' of mine.. he's helping us rustle up some money and for helping out 'we're gonna give him a shot'.  ""NO FUCKING WAY!"" shouted Boo.. he sounded drunk and like a deep voiced child that hasn't learned to speak quite completely yet. I pondered.. Crack damage? At that moment a shouting match broke out about giving me one bag and not giving me one bag.. COME WITH ME, he shouted, grabbing his shoulder and leading him off out of hearing range.
  

  


They came back. ""I've explained the situation. It's cool now""
'Yeah' said Boo. ""He's explained it, you're helping us out.""
Yeah. 100% . The streets is tough bruv and I like to think we're friends and we gotta help each other out. 
  

  


Could he lay it on any thicker? There was more creamy lie topping than there was actual truth cake in any of this. 

I was about to mention the fact that he wasn't totally ripped off, when he suddenly remembered himself and cut me off. 
  

  


""YO. Blood. Cuz.. yo..."" Boo was daydreaming... WHAT?? ""Yo. You know that money you gave me for your shots, we all got screwed over, we got nothing. Fucking stingers mate. That's how I met this guy who's gonna help us.""
  

  


Let me get this straight. You live with your friend here, you've lost his money, stolen what drugs you did get. You can't even be straight with him! Add another tick to the reputable, stand up gentleman column!
  

  


His dealer calls my phone, I answer and deliberately get my name in thinking it might be handy later.. ""Hello, yeah, h'es here.. hold on"" I pass it to my new best friend. He grabs it ""Yo. It's SKETCH. Talk to me. Yeah. I've just left. I'll be there in 10 minutes'"" He hands the phone back and I realise I've literally watched him lie to absolutely everyone he's knows in all the short time I've known him.. I wonder why I'm so special and different!
  

  


He turned to me. I can see you is ill init bruv and we gonna help you out. You help us out, we will sort you out. Don't yoooooou worry'.

I worried. Profusely.

  

  

Boo wandered off, looking for cigarette butts on the sidewalk. 
I realised I didn't know the guys name, so I asked. 
""Sketch, bruv"" He said, deadly serious without the merest hint of irony ""People call me Sketch"" 
  

  


""Oh - and my mate here wants to rip you off, but I told him no. We ain't having that. It's you and me cuz. All the way. You'll get your fill.""
  

  


I tried to remember where I'd heard a bigger load of bullshit. Then I remembered - at 3am about a year earlier, when the exact same thing happened. Fortunately, I only lost £5 that time. Why people ripping you off feel the need to reassure you until the VERY end right before they vanish into thin air. I'd be far more trustworthy if they didn't say anything. Organise the deal, then don't mention it again. Maybe it's guilt. But from my experience with H, you just feel less and less as time goes on. Until screwing over everyone from your family, partner, children is just a regular job to get what you need. I've done my best to avoid that.. but still lost a partner, my family and probably kids.. if I had any.
  

  


I went over the last time this did happen. I remember how ill I was, just how desperate it all was and how the promise of a fix cut through the lies I knew I was hearing. The merest possibility of help was enough to allow me to fall for it. 'Yeah, it's awful when people screw you over, it's the worst thing imaginable. You're ill, you're so close t o getting some, then you get burnt. Well, that ain't happening here. I'll sort you out, don't worry'
  

  


God DAMN was I super sick... I'd been been trying to score ALL day and it was 3am before I got this final handful of hope.
  

  


Anyway - all this madness is taking place at a bench near a bus stop.  Boo returned from his fag-butt expedition and Sketch launched into another one about sorting me out. I get the impression Boo ain't the full ticket. His comprehension is either really, really slow or he is really stupid. Or perhaps both. Having heard all this shit about me getting a bag before, I turn my back to them and notice I can watch them in the reflection of the nearby bus stop shelter and in one of the windows I can see him frantically winking and shaking his head, gesturing his head toward me all the while speaking at me as he reassures me over and over again.
  

  


In the end, the Gods rolled the dice for me. The ipods turned out to be broken. Anyone see that coming? I was glad. I knew he was screwing me and ready to run at the first sniff of cash. This guy is a walking liability, scarily unhinged and probably never once finished a sentence without a lie in it to anyone, anywhere.. ever. I'm amazed we haven't been arrested multiple times in the hour I've known him,
  

  


Right. I'm gonna try and find some money myself. They didn't hear me. Useless to them they were already walking off to beg for some more money on the street without saying a word to me. They crossed the road and Sketch picked up a large piece of cardboard that I noticed he had dropped when he went off to score the first time with the first dealer. He turned the board over and it had written on it ""NEED JUST £18 FOR A SHELTER TONIGHT. HOMELESS. PLEASE HELP. GOD BLESS"". Three lies in one sentence. A record!
  

  


I immediately called his dealer. ""Yo. Sketch has lost all the money and is screwing people over. I use my name again. Is it alright if I just buy from you direct and cut out the bullshit"" 
  

  


In 30 minutes I rustle up some money.. somehow. I meet the guy, Score. NEW CONNECT and its not bad!",1462482485.0

Throwaway obviously. I recently OD'd for the first time in my life and I'm looking for some answers, maybe something similar has happened to you.


Last Sunday I had 5 bags on me when I woke up, after doing my standard 6 or so the day before. I've been getting from the same dude since December and never had a problem. Around 2 pm I did 2, didn't really effect me, I'm used to doing at least 4 at once, but it chilled me out and made sure I wasn't feeling bad. Watched some NBA, nbd. Around 7 I decided to take a ""shower"" so I could do the remaining 3(live in gf doesn't know) and chill out the rest of the night and get a good night's sleep. The gf asked if she could use the bathroom while I was in the shower, I told her sure, just wait until I'm finished going, I'll text you once I hop in. So I rail the 3 bags(as I've done 100s of times, usually much more), put the empty bags in my wallet, and send the text that the coast is clear for her to come in. 

That's the last thing I remember. The next thing I know I come to surrounded by paramedics and cops, and a very upset and furious beyond belief gf. Apparently I took a full shower, went into our bedroom and got pants on, and passed out. She luckily was calling me for dinner and went upstairs when I didn't answer, and found me half falling off the bed, face completely blue. Luckily, she dialed 911 immediately and since she had been suspecting drug use for a while, went into my wallet and flushed the bags. I was revived with no long term damage and no charges.

Now, I'm scared straight currently, but has this ever happened to anyone else? I have a decent tolerance, had known what I was getting for a while now, did 2 from the same batch and was fine, and never used IV as a ROA. Is it possible this was just an allergic reaction? I did not have to be narcanned to be revived, so I guess there's no way to tell that for sure.

so i took my last shot about 20 hours ago and went into withdrawal later that night using clonidine, clonopin and tramadol 24 hour slow release with milk thistle to potentate it.

im going to wait for probably the 40 hour mark to go back on subs but i want to go on as low a dose as possible like 2 mg cause i read somewhere that low doses are really all that are needed and that these days people are put on doses that are way to high and unnessary. 

i want to begin tapering subs again as soon as i stabilize and get off opiates for good. this switch to heroin got ugly and i started injecting all my doses and feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing.

so what im asking here is from people who know about low doses of subs being all thats necessary is how do i induct back on subs aiming at a low dose like 2 mg or so.

note that tramadol and subs do not interact so taking tramadol does not cause precipitated withdrawal with subs

thanks

Edit: previous to this relapse I was on subs for more then half a year",1462623204.0

I’m writing this without a special purpose, I just stumbled into /r/opiates recently and liked the community very much. Probably I’m just writing because I’m in mild withdrawal and very sad at the moment.

I always liked drugs, I’m in my early-mid twenties and always had problems with any substance. In the beginning it was mainly amphetamines, I didn’t even like weed so much not to mention opiates or any other medication. Over the years I abused speed in various forms, after that I was really really heavy into smoking weed (which I’m nowadays also but not that bad) and during the last 4-5 years I got in touch with prescription meds benzos etc. Every few months I did a binge with my meds of choice, mainly opiates because benzos do not affect me for whatever reason and definitely also went through withdrawal every now and then. I don’t have to point out all the miserable situation where I had to work although I was sick as fuck.
Few years and some inconvenient events later, which reach from problems with my father (who left the country), my best friend who committed suicide or my now ex-girlfriend and friends which went on and don’t have that much time like earlier. Sure I also did school but rather bad and now I’m in the end of an apprenticeship, in a company in which I can work after I’m finished. I’m even writing my final exams from Monday to Wednesday in the following week. 

That’s when my problems turn to really bad: I recently did a binge with a few meds as always when I had the fabulous idea to try dope (for the second time) but after I did my first few doses I knew this time I was hooked. I could never handle drugs and always abused everything to the limit in the shortest timespan and this time I knew this wasn’t for once. 

So now I’m sitting here, physical withdrawals are pretty okay, but emotionally I’d like to cry or kill myself as I realized I have no one left despite being a cool guy some years ago, however I’m really good in my work. Biggest problem is that I wasted my time smoking dope instead of spending it on learning and now I have a habit which I don’t want to quit this time. In this condition I convince myself that I’m not able to learn/concentrate. I know it’s an easy task to stop now but I was in this situation so often and this time I simply cannot resist. The very bad thing is that I didn’t start to do dope only because it was fun. I mainly started to erase my sad emotions over what happened the last years. I was not able to score any more dope which was very bad luck and now I’m sitting here and I just remembered that there is some residue on my used tin foils and the pole I was using to inhale the smoke which I’m going to scratch out now.

Maybe this was just an introduction to me as you will see me often in the future because on /r/opiates and reddit in general I do not feel so alone. Excuse me for the long text, I tried to keep it short.

4i9noo,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4i9noo/interesting_concept_i_read_about_opioids_for/,37,https://redd.it/4i9noo,OpiatedMinds,Interesting concept I read about opioids for depression.,"From this website: http://derekwmeyer.blogspot.com/2010/10/oxymorphone-hydromorphones-sibling.html

> Along with buprenorphine, oxymorphone has been specifically mentioned as a possible symptomatic treatment with severe depression which has not responded well to SSRI's SNRI's or stimulants. Opioids had been historically used for this purpose and are highly effective in attenuating severe depressive symptoms, much more so than today's aggressively prescribed & toxic monoaminergic antidepressants, which may be little more effective than placebo. Opioids exhibit direct action on mesolimbic dopamine transmission and profoundly alter the brain's emotional interpretation of suffering. Interestingly, research is continuously discovering connections between serotonergic transmission and the triggering of endogenous opioid transmission. Regardless of science however, the mere symptomatic treatment of mood disorders with opioids is not accepted by todays establishments, as after all, the motive behind prohibition is based heavily on social control and morality, far more than it is science. Our government is greatly concerned with protecting us from ourselves and maintaining control over individual brain chemistry and behavior, and is not open to reason.

This makes solid sense to me. The medical community recognizes opioids as a way to treat physical pain. Well, we all know it does a decent job of eliminating psychological suffering.

I've seen posts about this before, someone posting along the lines of ""I took percocet, and it lifts my mood and eliminates depression, why isn't this prescribed as an antidepressant?""

Well of course the responses come in like ""yeah, but it will be less effective over time, and make the problem worse""

I think that could be analogous to chronic pain. Opioids over time become less effective as tolerance builds. For chronic pain opioids aren't exactly ideal (I know sometimes they are legitimately used for chronic pain, but other treatments should be utilized instead if possible).

Opioids are absolutely fantastic for treating acute pain however, and maybe that should be considered as analogous to severe depression. 

An opioid used long term for depression obviously wouldn't be ideal, and may cause more harm than good. But for someone suicidal, with a severe case of depression, opioids could be used for a short time period to get it under control or keep it at bay, as other treatments are initiated and explored.

It would be the coolest, baddest-ass doctor to have the big brass balls to use opioids off-label for severe unremitting depression, and it obviously would have to be done with great care, and for the shortest amount of time possible.

And sadly that doctor would be ridiculed and shit-talked, when they would be thinking outside the box on a genius level. I wonder if that could be done without catching career damaging flack, say if all other treatments, medical and cognitive therapy etc, were tried and found ineffective. 

I mean fuck the risk of addiction, if it were sure to save someone from taking their own life, it would be well justified in my opinion.

Here is an idea of the use pattern but I think that the physical withdrawals may have already set in in this scenario.

In the last two weeks my buddy has gone through about 3 grams of powdered Heroin (ECP) in the Midwest. He originally was getting high off of just one ""dose"" (.05) snorted but now he says it takes 3 or 4 doses if sniffed and more like .01 for a decent shot. He seems to think the quality is pretty good/comparable to what he was using a few years back. The first gram he pretty much exclusively sniffed but the last 2gs he has been banging the Heroin. 

He is freaking out that he is gonna get sick if he doesn't get more and like a damn fool thought that he could get a G and ""just use casually"". Obviously that has failed and literally the last 2 weeks he has been getting High at least once a day if not more, basically getting another G every 5 days. I told him his plan was shit and that there is no way he was gonna go back to chipping/recreational use after being an everyday IV user for over 2 years! He didn't listen and instead of just stopping he just keeps getting more dope. 

Is his concern warranted? Will he have horrible withdrawals at this point? I imagine even if he is truly physically hooked the withdrawal will pass pretty quickly after only 2 weeks of use!",1462584842.0

He was experiencing [dyspnea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyspnea) so was placed on hydromorphone. The dosage progression has been:

 - 0.5mg orally every 6 hours
 - 0.25mg subcutaneously every 6 hours (equivalent, but faster)
 - 0.25mg subcutaneously every 4 hours (50% increase)
 - 0.50mg subcutaneously every 4 hours (100% increase)

The time between changes has consistently been around 1 week.

The latest increase seems to have brought a definite...fuzziness...to his mental state. It's not dramatic, for short periods a stranger might not even notice, but I know him well and it is noticeable and tangible and, I think it's fair to say, affecting his decision making.

My question is....given this progression, is there a way to guesstimate how many more dose doublings before we really lose him to dreamyland? I know there is no way to be exact, I'm just trying to get a sense if we're one increase away, or 3-4 increases away, that kind of thing. 

There are some significant family planning issues that need to be resolved, and knowing with even a little confidence that time is short would help bring focus to that.

Personally I haven't bought locally in years, and can't imagine buying anything but on the DNM.  For one, the quality is the absolute best of the best. It's impossible to get such quality locally, even if the local dealer got their gear on the DNM, they would absolutely either step on it 5 times over, or inflate the price like a motherfucker, and I don't blame them, as the 'Frank Lucas' mentality of selling uncut gear is unheard of these days. If you are in it to make money, it would be foolish to sell such pure gear especially when you know you can step on it and double/triple their profits.

For two, no worrying about face to face deals. What beats getting your gear delivered to your door? Especially when you're dope sick, there is nothing better to wake up (if you can get any sleep to begin with) to a batch of heroin in your mailbox.

And for three, the prices (at least here) are either cheaper or on par with local prices. That right there is a no brainer, why get some stepped on local shit for X price, when I can get top quality pure raw for the same price.


So to those who haven't used DNM, why don't you start!? What is holding you back? Just curious to know!

My dboy is also a good friend of mine. He's also the reason I jumped from a nasty pill habit to heroin as he convinced me that I'd be able to save money as compared to pills, which is true in part.

A while back he made a bad deal with some cash of mine. He now owes me about 7-8 grams. He lives day to day and isn't big time so I agreed to let him pay me over time with half g here or there.

Lately he hasn't been wanting to give me the stuff he owes me. I basically have to beg when I run out and he'll only help me if I'm truly sick. How would you all approach this? Keep in mind aside from an unreliable backu plug a few towns away, he's basically my only connect.

Next question is, when we first started this whole thing the prices were ok but not great. He said they would get better if I got more at a time so I obliged. Problem is, he never seems to be able to tell me how much I'll get and gives me options as to whether I want quality junk or good but not fire, each having the appropriate prices. He doesn't really honor what I request and just gets me whatever he wants to buy. It seems he does this to get himself what he wants and so he can use my money to get better deals, but then over charges me in the end. He also makes me give him cash up front because I usually buy more than he Keeps on hand. When it comes time to pick up, he takes forever and then seems to not want to give me whatever amount we agreed to before (which lately hasn't been a very good deal to begin with considering the amount being picked up).

Finally, this last time I picked up my bag had solid sugar crystals floating around in it. He got offended when I told him about it and now is acting like I'm a huge inconvenience for expecting the quality and weight we agreed to initially. 

Overall I just don't know what to do. We've been friends much longer than this so part of me wants to believe he's just getting jerked around and is doing the best he can. The other part of me believes he's trying to make me his meal ticket and is just taking advantage of me.

A Half gram (absolutely amazing quality) would last me MAYBE 48 hours snorting. About a month ago I shot up, and ever since I've stretched my H out much much better. A half G will last me a week, doing two .035 shots a day. I can't believe a point lasts me a day and change now. 

I don't use (at least in the last 2 years) to nod off, I use just enough to feel 'normal' with slight euphoria. My question is, will this soon increase my tolerance so much that like 6 months from now I'll be back on the Half G in under 48 hours, only now I'll need to shoot it as opposed to snorting?

Ideally I should quit, obvious right? But if I'm going to keep using, is it wise to shoot rather then snort? Or in other words, is it worth it to shoot a little over half a point a day, rather then snorting 3 points of the same gear a day?

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who replied! I've decided I'm going to go back to snorting. While the needle seems great now, everyone seems to agree I'll be right back up to doing 3 points a day, only this time I'll need to shoot it.

4i5t3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4i5t3o/wish_me_luck/,27,https://redd.it/4i5t3o,jones-singh,Wish me luck,"So I have recently been seeing a woman who has been wonderful.  We have known each other for about a year - usually just picking up together - and just recently became involved.  I have absolutely no support system, as no one else knows I use, and she has been an angel to me.  I have helped her out of many binds, and she has always returned the favor as best she can.  

Lately, both of us have been losing our minds because of the addiction we've been battling.  We both have a little tiny bit of sub right now, and are hoping to get some more, and the past couple weeks we have been talking about how this insidious addiction has been eating away at our lives... Our souls, our finances, and our will to keep living when it gets really bad.  We both HATE the suboxone stabilization process.  For both her and for me, it is a day or two of a whirlwind of emotions - mainly depression and anxiety - and we've been terrified of it.  We both spent more money than we should have all week, but finally both committed to starting our subs yesterday.  And so far, it's working.

Yesterday she and I felt awful.  I called off yesterday and she quit one of her jobs (she had already put in her notice anyway) and came over for a few hours so we could cuddle and get some rest.  She gave me half a Val 10 for the anxiety, and it helped so much.  She went to her other job after cuddling with me, then got off work there and we spent the rest of the night holding each other and reassuring each other, coming up with our solid taper plan, and eventually falling asleep.  It was beautiful.  Went with her this morning to get a few more Valiums to aid us through the next couple days, and we will be staying on Suboxone only for only as long as absolutely necessary.  We will begin our tapering plan very quickly.

I know this is sort of a pointless post, and I know that two addicts getting together usually results in codependence and amplified addict behavior, but we both REALLY want this.  We need this.  We've spent countless hours confiding in each other, crying together, and finally working up the courage to take the plunge to Suboxone.  Today I'm feeling fantastic.  Dosed 2mg initially yesterday, another 1mg a few hours later, and then another 1 in the middle of the night when WDs seemed to be coming back (could have been psychosomatic or just the fact that I'm not 100% stabilized yet.)  I haven't dosed since then, and it was around 4am.  Took half a Valium 10 this morning and I've been feeling like myself again.  Not seeking a high from the benzos by any means - just feeling NORMAL.  Which is fantastic.  I know this is only day two, but I have an optimistic outlook.  She and I can beat this.  We support each other completely, encourage each other to CALL EACH OTHER IMMEDIATELY if one of us has an INKLING of picking up, and I feel true honesty and trust between us.  I expect a little bit of warnings by any commenters here, and that's cool.  I just wanted to share that this is the happiest I have felt in a long, long time WITHOUT dope.  I think once this taper happens and completes, she and I might have a shot at a fulfilling life (or separate lives if we don't last,) and it makes me so hopeful.  

Thanks for listening, bropes.  I just needed to get that out there.  I am so happy I could cry right now.  Finally over that initial induction hump.  Not so much to be scared of anymore as long as we stick to our plan.

EDIT: All this being said, I'm FULLY aware that this is just a momentary snapshot of my frame of mind.  I don't expect judgement here from anyone if she and/or I slip - because we all know how likely it is - but it'd be a little embarassing, I have to admit.  She and I have talked about this a lot: if it's going to be one of us slipping, it'll be both, and that's the reason she and I are absolutely committed to being 100% honest about our cravings.  We both know the fire we are playing with by being two addicts trying to do this together.  However, I want to give it a try.  It's my only lifeline and hers as well, unless we want to involve our families, and I just don't want to put our families through that.  ",1462551367.0

I do have a few questions though, really for those who have gone through it.

     Being the intrepid explorer that I am, I could not resist catching a buzz from history. I took two and went back to working to await the results.  Will the hydrocodone still be active? After the typical waiting period of approximately 30 minutes, I start to notice the all too familiar feeling of coming up. Ah, that's nice! I think the opiate component has lost some of it's potency, but it still more or less gets the job done. I continue my search but to no avail.

4icneb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/4icneb/poppy_seed_opium/,17,https://redd.it/4icneb,wisdom_man,Poppy seed opium?,"*Disclaimer, I'm pretty high rn so I ended up rambling and leaving a lot of untied ends. TLDR has all of the questions I actually care about*

I use poppy seed tea once in a while (like once a month), so I know the process. Can you make a solid, smokable ""opium"" out of it? I googled and found some conflicting information so I thought I'd post here. 

**Process**

My intuition tells me all you'd need to do to make PSO is:

* make the tea. Get it to the point where you would normally drink/mix it (like strain out the seeds, etc)

* let all the liquid evaporate away (maybe strain it once in a while). Not sure how long that would take

* once all the liquid is evaporated boom look at that you have a smokable product.

However, I also saw an instructional post involving alcohol (ethanol? Isopropyl? Idk) and something like that, and I'm just kinda confused. 

**ROA's**

I'm assuming this poppy seed opium would be orally active, as it's just dehydrated PST. But could you sniff it and get an effect? I wonder what the bioavailability of each ROA would be

The main reason to make PSO would be to smoke it. But how would you go about smoking it? Would you take a freebase pipe and vaporize it, or roll it like a joint and burn it? I know ""opium pipes"" are an established thing, but idk if those would work for this kind of opium, or even where I would get an opium pipe.

If smoked, could this filter through water? Could I smoke/dab this out of my bong like I would weed/shatter? I doubt this would work, because I believe most/all opiates are water soluble, so the water ""filter"" would shlcherp up all the fun stuff. But I'm not a scientist so I'll just let Reddit tell me what to do 

I would probably never want to do any ROA's ""harder"" than smoke the PSO, but could you IV or plug it too? How would you go about IVing it, same as H? TBH I don't even know how to IV a non-liquid street drug (I've seen breaking bad and pulp fiction, but still) and there's no reason for me to learn.

I wonder what the bioavailability of each ROA would end up being. 

Wow that ended up being super rambly, I'm sorry. Just drank my highest dose of PST (200g of good seeds, but no lemon juice. Also no tolerance) and I'm feeling damn good right now


**TL:DR** 1. How could you make poppy seed opium (PSO) out of poppy seeds? Could you just make poppy seed tea and let the water evaporate out completely? 2. How exactly would you smoke PSO? Freebase pipe and vaporize it, or roll/pack and burn it? 3. If you could just pack a bowl of PSO when you smoke it, could you filter it through water like in a weed bong? ",1462670200.0

So if these Sevredol have similar pain relief as cocadomal, I will make the switch to Sevredol for the sake of my liver).

Ps. I'm kind of a noob with opiates (more of a benzo guy), I only really know about codeine. Is there a ""street"" name for these Sevredol's? Like cocodamol are ""kpak"" for example (where I'm from anyway).

Edit: I just found this [Opiate dose comparison](http://www.wales.nhs.uk/sites3/documents/814/OpiateConversionDoses%5BFinal%5DNov2010.pdf) chart, and it states ""30mg codeine = 4.5mg morphine"". So 20mg Sevredol is equivalent to roughly 120mg codeine. Does that sound about right?",1462642494.0

This story ended up being so long I broke it into three parts, then analyzed the speedball synergy, then added a TL;DR of the story.

>**Part ONE: Intro and Coming Up**

A few weeks ago I got a 5lb bag of poppy seeds to make tea with. I've never been an opiate guy, but that's mainly due to the price, and these seeds were cheap. I made and tried poppy seed tea (PST) several times before last night, each time increasing the dose. Previously, the most I have had was 150g of seeds. I haven't dosed opiates in around a month (I limit myself to one use a month) so I have no tolerance, but I've noticed I have a pretty high natural tolerance. 

Last night I made tea with 200g of seeds. I didn't think it was that big of a jump in dosage, but apparently it was. I mixed all of the tea into a bottle of gatorade (probably 4:1 gatorade to PST) and drank it over the course of around an hour. I forgot to add lemon juice (or anything similar) to the mix. I finished at **8pm, so I'll call that T=0**. 

**T-0:45** around fifteen minutes into sipping the PST I dosed around 30mg DPH and 30mg DXM (both oral syrups). I heard the antihistamine will help with the itching, and the DXM would potentiate a bit. 

**T+0:20** I could start to feel a buzz coming on. I knew the comeup was going to be long and drawn out since I took so long to drink the tea. I felt relaxed and comfy, and a little bit of a head high. 

**T+1:30** By now the effects were very obvious. I wasn't exactly nodding yet, but I was very relaxed, my eyes felt droopy, and my motor skills and reaction time felt quite a bit slower. 

**T+2:30** At this point I was convinced I was ""peaking"". Very little ability for fine motor control (texting was a bitch), I felt really sleepy, I couldn't walk straight to save my life. The body high was not incredibly pronounced, but I just physically felt relaxed, and a bit couch-locked. During the past hour, I had picked up my guitar and at one point was just unable to play as I didn't have the motor skills to do so. The head high was also mild, kinda like a subtle and pleasant lightheadedness. 

Texting a friend, I described my state as ""a really awesome cross between being drunk and having an edible"" and ""you know how a cat can sit anywhere and find a way to be comfortable right there? That's how I feel right now""

**T+2:45** I debated on going to sleep or not, as I was waiting for a friend to visit but wasn't getting any more replies (turns out she fell asleep hah). I went outside and smoke two cigs, and they felt okay. Before I smoked, I didn't realize how mentally hazy I felt (I'd compare the 'haze' to drunkness, but a bit more subtle), but the nicotine helped clear away a bit of that haze. 

**T+3:00** I decided my friend was not coming over, and got ready for bed. Brushed my teeth, took my normal nightly supplements (magnesium, zinc, 3mg melatonin, multivitimin, and 1g of L-arginine). Over the last 45 minutes I had also started to become a bit itchy, so I also dosed 50mg doxylamine succinate (another antihistimine sleep aid). 

>**Part TWO: Trippy Shit and Bad Decisions**

At this point I layed down in bed and began to watch tv to go to sleep, but I noticed nausea creeping up on me. I was dreading the nausea, because my previous experience with PST I puked for basically an hour straight. I ate three or four tums, and half of a sandwich-roll (just the bread) and drank a bit of water. After a few minutes the nausea subsided. 

**T+3:30** I had been nodding in and out during the whole episode of Rick and Morty, but I decided I really had to get to sleep (had to be up early for work the next day). I turn the tv off. 

Over the next hour or so, I kept nodding in and out, in a weird lucid way. Like I wasn't exactly asleep, but I was having vivid dreams. I was aware of what time it was throughout this experience, but I could hear conversations and if I closed my eyes see people like a dream. I also don't remember specifically what I was ""dreaming"" about, but I know I was lucid enough to hear my roommates come home and know what time it was. I'm a bit of an acid-head, and this honestly felt very trippy to me. 

**T+4:30** At this point, I somehow convinced myself I was mostly down from the PST. I was still very stumbly walking around and very slow to type, but I needed an excuse to use something else to help me fall asleep. 

I had already tried melatonin and antihistimines, so I **sublingually dosed a 1mg etizolam pellet**. At the time, I knew it was a bad idea, but I also knew I had to get some sleep because I had a full day of work and there was only five hours left before my alarm was to go off. *I know mixing downers (especially opiates, especially when you're naive with dosage) is a terrible idea and people shouldn't do that*. I have a bit of a tolerance to etizolam, but I wasn't willing to dose any higher than that with the PST. 

I turned the TV back on as I waited for the effects of the etizolam to kick in. I'd like to note, this entire time I was trying to sleep, I felt *very* sleepy, and just like couldn't really sleep. I felt like I was in a weird limbo of consciousness, not awake but not asleep. Is that what nodding really is? 

**T+5:15** The trippy sensation still continued for several hours. Rick and Morty were dancing in fractals in my mind. This was not at all what I expected to experience when I dosed. At this point, the etizolam made me feel even more sleepy, so I turn the tv back off and try to to sleep. 

**T+5:15-9:00** I continue to nod in and out in that weird, triplike state. My headspace wasn't too similar to an acid trip, but it was still going crazy with the visuals and my dreams were incredibly trippy. I still never *really* feel like I'm asleep through this time

**T+9:00** I lean up from a nod and notice it's 5am, my alarms are going to be going off in half an hour. I think I woke up a bit more because the etizolam was no longer active. I drank some water, and went back to the nod. Since I was so tired and high, it didn't even occur to me that I probably wouldn't sober up before work at 7. 

**T+9:00-9:30** Once I laid back down I finally felt like I fell asleep. I know I still dreamed vividly during this short sleep, but it felt normal, not like trippy or whatever. I slept very well for this short amount of time. 

**T+9:30** My alarms go off and I fully wake up. I realize that if anything I'm higher than I was when I tried to go to sleep. I **orally dose 200mg of caffeine** (one caffeine pill) and **orally dose 40mg vyvanse** (that I am actually legally prescribed haha) and get into the bathroom. I keep nodding off whenever I'm still, sitting on the toilet, standing in the shower, basically everywhere. 

**T+10:00** I get out of the shower and am immediately nauseous. I eat some tums and nibble on that dinner roll, but nothing helped. I ended up puking a TON into the toilet. Not sure if the caffeine made it into my system, but I'm assuming the vyvanse did not get into my system. 

**T+10:10** My nausea has almost completely subsided. I ate a couple more tums, finished that roll, and **orally dosed 80mg vyvanse**. I was still nodding every time I sat down, I was scared to death to drive to work but don't have any sick time and need the money. I was hoping the vyvanse would keep me functional. I have a moderate amphetamine tolerance, 80mg is usually a ""functional high"" and above 100mg is usually pretty tweaky for me when otherwise sober. 

**T+10:30** I get my shit together, brush my teeth, and leave for work. I was hoping to get out around 10-15 minutes earlier, as it normally takes me 30 minutes to drive to work and I wasn't sure how slow I would need to take it on the road. I had the A/C blasting in my face to keep me up, and I had a fire playlist blaring that I sang along to to keep myself awake. I only listened to bangers I knew the words of so I could sing myself awake. 

This drive was rough and reckless. I don't think I was ""obviously high"" to any possible onlookers, but I had to drive my normal 10mph above to get to work on time. I was feeling a really strange mix of ashamed and terrified and also super relaxed and cozy. Along the way I stopped at dunkin donuts and got myself a breakfast sandwich. 

**T+11:00** Got to work just on time. I'm pretty new to [orange big box home improvement store] and still have training videos to watch, so my manager lets me sit in the training room and watch videos and eat breakfast for a while. I don't think I was walking weird, but I also went on a hard run the day before (earlier in the day from when I drank the PST) so I might have looked weird anyways. I didn't have any trouble talking to my manager, I just came across as half-awake (and that was my earliest shift at that store yet, so not unexpected)

**T+11:30** Watching videos and eating breakfast did nothing to sober me up. I decided to **orally dose another 80mg vyvanse** to hopefully become a functional retail slave. I was nodding out pretty badly during most of those videos, but didn't get that weird trippy effect again. 

>**Part THREE: Speedball (Drugs While on the Clock)**

**T+12:30-15:00** Finished up my last training video, and coincidentally felt the vyvanse coming up. I was feeling more and more functional. I put on my orange apron, and head out onto the floor to help out customers. I felt very confident, but the synergy was super interesting. 

I was totally okay helping customers out and doing my job, the highs were complementing each other in a way that made me very functional. I felt the 'urge' to hyperfocus, but if I focused on/stared at something too long I could feel my eyes get droopy and I'd feel like I'm about to nod. But yeah I was very talkative and polite, and overally just had a really tweaky mentally, very similar to how I would normally feel on just 80mg vyvanse. But physically I felt super relaxed, and not even the shittiest customers got me down, and I had no trouble lifting or pulling any large item (either drug would probably show similar results independently though). 

**T+15:00** I got out of work and into my car. The vyvanse has definitely been more forward since I came all the way up, but I can still feel the PST effects subtly. Was bumping atlanta trap on the way to my other job (package store) and geeking out at the beat. But I also almost nodded out at a stop light. This drive felt much more safe, with the vyvanse I did not feel like my driving was compromised at all. 

**T+15:30** Got to the liquor store (my other job), the owner was there, and I felt 100% normal talking to her. Well, I felt like I normally would on a 'functional high' level of vyvanse. 

**T+17:00** Starting to come down from vyvanse and can still feel PST effects a bit. Getting more lethargic, mouth is getting a bit dry (I am pretty dehydrated). The second long nods are getting slightly more intense and frequent. But I'm still like, alive. I still have energy, I'm not just a sack of potatos. Good thing I staggered the vyvanse dosing. 

**T+18:15** Energy is starting to fade hard. I'm getting tired, my legs are sore from standing all day (and that run yesterday. Actually a little surprised I'm not more sore), and I'm getting pretty hungry. 

This is when more trippy shit started happening again. If I focus my vision on something, my peripheral vision is pretty hazy but it seems almost like trippy visuals in the haze. I close my eyes and don't see any CEV's, but I see faint OEV's (like patterned squiggles and colors and fractals that aren't there) subtly in my peripheral vision. That's only something I notice when I'm not really focusing mentally on anything. If I'm helping a customer or typing this or whatever the visuals aren't present. 

**T+18:45** Visuals thing is still the same kinda concept but has gotten a little more frequent. I'mna blame it on lack of sleep, and **orally dose 40mg vyvanse** to keep myself sane. I didn't wanna waste this much medication today but I also do enjoy being sane so. 

**T+19:40** The store has been crazy busy. The local University's graduation is today so everybody is coming in to buy drinks. All I've been doing the last hour and a half is writing this and ringing people out. The visuals died down when the vyvanse came up. That was a good amount of vyvanse to dose, because I don't feel like I'm tweaking, I just kinda feel normal. I feel a *little* hungry, but the vyvanse is probably suppressing my appetite quite a bit. 

I think the effects of the PST are mostly gone by now. I think I was slowly coming down from the PST around [T+15:00] or a tad earlier, and just gradually got opiate-sober by around Are OEV's a normal effect of poppy seed tea? I haven't heard of that one before. Overall this was a much more intense and a much trippier experience than I was expecting, and nothing blew up in my face so I'll call it a win. 

**T+23:00** Feeling pretty normal, just tired. When I was supposed to close my package store at 5 (T+21:00) I started talking to this guy about school and drugs and shit, and we ended up talking for over an hour. A goddamn hour without me even noticing. I'm sure I did most of the talking, which means the vyvanse is still at least a little active in my system. 

Just drove home, and when I pulled into the driveway I just sat and relaxed for a minute, and it almost felt like I was going to nod again. But it was different. I would have nodded for sure if the PST was still active, so now I'm sure it's not. Now I'll just have to deal with going to sleep tonight with all this amphetamine in my system. 

**T+27:45** I am dead tired. It took a few more hours for me to really stop tweaking. I just realized I haven't eaten today since breakfast and the only water I've had was to wash down pills. Is this rock bottom? Only one way to find out

___________________________________________________________

**OVERALL** I thought the synergy was pretty interesting. I felt very talkative and emotionally energized, but it took conscious effort to not nod off even on the vyvanse. I kept hyperfocusing on whatever and then nodding off while looking at it. If it wasn't for responsibilities, this would have been a very euphoric, comfortable, functional high. However, hopefully I will never ever do it again, this speedball was only out of necessity. If I use poppy seed tea again, I'll make sure to have the whole next day blocked out for it

_____________________________________________________________________

**TL;DR**

I tried a moderately high dose of poppy seed tea without realizing how long the duration really was. Dosed at 8pm, and enjoyed my evening. Went to bed, didn't exactly sleep but had a weird psychedelic-like experience. Woke up higher than I've ever been. Nodded off in the shower. Had to drive a half hour to work, ended up speedballing with my vyvanse to stay functional. Forgot to eat or drink water literally all day, but I finished the day like a champ. Or however close to a champ one could be coming out of that situation. ",1462795691.0

I have been an addict for about 20 years.  Everything I do I get addicted to.  At 20 I was addicted to steroids and working out.  Everything I ever do I do to the extreme; I ""juiced"" until I grew a breast and my prostate was swollen to the point I needed to urinate 400 times a day, I stopped the steroids. I started playing the guitar at 21 I played for 16 hours a day for years.  I didn't get out of my housecoat, I smoked hash all day, I woke up and practiced scales until I passed out with my guitar.  I never had a balanced life.  When I went to work as a Pipefitter I worked every hour I could, I studied my trade compulsively.  I worked like a man possessed and I climbed the ladder in my profession.  Life was good, I partied hard, drinking every night, I was clearing over 5000$ a week working, I started using cocaine and Oxycodone, this allowed me to function with next to no sleep.  I was an extremely high function addict, I was using an ounce a week of coke and at least 640mg of Oxycodone daily at work.  I never had a bad day or any sadness for over 10 years.  Every day was the best day ever.  I progressed to using heroin, fentanyl and crack.  I changed over to crack as my sinus would not allow me to snort drugs anymore.  I still worked hard and was able to function like this for years.  I drove exotic cars, I traveled, I was a good dad.  Eventually every cent I had was going to drugs, I wasn't taking care of business like I should, I missed some work days, crashed some vehicles, slipped on my child support, so stopped working and went on Suboxone.  I moved home with my mother at 41 to get clean.  I am almost 44 now, I am still at home with my mom.  I haven't had a real happy day In years.  I dabble in drugs sometimes to get a break from the depression but I go months and months at a time taking no opiates.  I haven't did cocaine in years.  I have tried several antidepressants and I'm currently trying noratrypline  for the last month (pardon my spelling) and growth hormone I got from a good source to try and kick start my system again.  I haven't been interested in girls in years even though according to my blood work my testosterone levels are ok.  So for around 3 years my drug use has been limited yet I never get better.  I won't kill myself because I love my mom and it would devastate her.  I haven't talked to my daughter in well over a year (she is 14) as I am so ashamed at myself.  I don't want her to see me like I am, such a loser, a deadbeat that hasn't payed child support in years.  We were very very close but she started being very angry with me because I was failing to follow through on promises I'd make to her.  She sent me angry emails that I just stopped opening, I don't answer the phone because I can't cope with any stress.  I have a son with another woman, he is 18, I see him a few times a month.  I tell him I am so depressed I can't see him much or talk to him just because I am so sad.  I talked to him about my addiction and he is understanding, he just wants me to get better.  I don't answer the phone when he calls but he still comes by a few times a month to see me.  I tell him I love him but I'm just fucked up and I don't like company, it's nothing personal.  He's probably getting sick of me never getting better.  
  Does anybody have any experience with this type of depression?  I was a happy guy, I come from a loving mother and a good family.  There is no reason for me to be a hopeless addict that I can figure out.  It's been years since I did a lot of drugs yet still every day I wake up I just want to die.  The small amount of drugs I do sometimes after months and months of being clean just give me a break from the misery I feel everyday.  It helps me remember life and happiness.  Is there a type of antidepressant that any of you out there have tried that made you feel better?  Years and years of doing next to no drugs and I just want to die everyday.  My drug use was very very heavy but surely I can heal?  Is it possible I damaged myself to the point I can never be happy again, I can never function again?  Is methadone the only way I can feel normal?  I was still sad everyday taking suboxone.  I am scared that if I take methadone my brain will never heal and I will never know what it is like to just wake up and be normal without taking a drug.  Can anybody suggest an antidepressant that might work?  I know this post is a bit of a ramble and it's hard to diagnose something from this limited information on me.  What should I do?  What can I try?  It's been years.  Can anyone or anything help me?  Did anyone else experience this after years of addiction and get better?  Thanks for listening.  All the best.

I spent Friday thru today carefully and strategically dosing as far between as I could so as not to be sick.

When this starts happening I can litterly pinch my flaccid dick and cume. And it's not just once but like 15-20 times. Full blown orgasm, the first three or four I bust a nutt then the rest are just normal hard core orgasms but dry. It's weird cause normally when I'm fucking its a bust once and im done for Atleast an hour but when I'm withdrawing my flaccid dick is just cumeing and cumeing its fuckin bizarre but these orgasms are some of the strongest I have ever had. 

You would think it would be cool but it kinda sucks.

Police show up, a tow truck is hooked to my car, the owner of the car I fucked up is here, and walking over comes my dealer dude. I tell him sorry and hand him my money. Never to be heard from again. First time and last time I ever let my money walk.

I left my job, I wrecked my car, my boyfriend and I move back in with his parents. Military family. They agreed to provide a roof in exchange for random searches and drug tests. We agree. We have to.

I'm not ready to stop. And it's not even about chasing that high anymore. It's the ritual, the process, the steps, the anxiety, the relief. I haven't hit bottom yet.

I'm on day three of withdrawals. I can't move. All I want is one more shot. But I scavenged my recently used rigs for a tiny taste yesterday so I know there's nothing left. A watered down piss color of a shot I managed to inject.

It's mother's day and I haven't seen my 2 year old daughter. I'm a city over with no transportation. And all I want is to feel better.",1462764746.0

He is slicing through money, lying comfortably, and life has started to fall apart.  Every time he is caught, he admits a little more.  
He is 32, living at home, just lost a great job, and claims to have just used pills occasionally.  I think that he is using daily.  Hooked.  Question---any opinions on how hard we should push him towards admitting the severity of the addiction?  I think he is trying to manage everything and soften the losses.  If we sat with him, and pointed out the many lies, asked him to show us his texts, and called him out on inconsistencies.....there would be a stack of things against him.  His parents don't want to kick him out, but he is using and says people in rehab told him that opiate blockers don't work, so he won't take them.  They are going to take over his finances, manage his meds, but they have a question of how far to push the rest of the issues.  
Any advice?

I did this approximately 3 days ago. 4 at the latest, but pretty positive it was 3 days ago. Since the water wasnt boiled or technically sterile before hand, is there any chance that this water stored in the hypodermic needle grew any sort of bacteria or anything?

My new dentist is very modern. I get nitrous now which I never had before this year, and it makes the 90 minute deep cleaning easier. This is not a ""scaling"" but they do go under the gum.

I am also on the final phase (the easy one) of an implant, they just will put it on.

Back when I had the major work for the prep (not the extraction but after), the drilling into jaw bone, I did call the day after to say I was still in pain, on max ibuprofen and Tylenol, and they pushed back saying give it another day. So they did not provide anything nor did I push it.

I really want something after the Novocain wears off for the deep cleaning.  Jaw pain causes migraines (I see a neurologist for that) and I have to stay off that cycle.

I really want to ask my dentist after my 2+ hour appt. for some pain medicine, but I know it's just bad form. I can call the next day, but I think they will tell me to hold off, since the pain improves after that.

I have never gotten pain meds from this dentist?

Anyone have any guesses as to what the doctor will say? I guess worst case, I don't get another script and I'm screwed. Best case, since it was so easy the first time, she tells me to keep trying and hands me another prescription. I really do want to stop, and clearly need to add some sort of therapy or meetings to my plan, rather than just the Bunavail alone.

I tried to quit opiates last week. I've been a heroin addict for a year or so, and then I got on methadone for 2 and a half months. Started at 30mg, for the last month or so was at 100mg a day. 

I got through 5 full days of withdrawal before I went back to using, did fentanyl for 2 days. Now I've done heroin for 2 days. My tolerance is, of course, way down, though not for long. I need to work for the next three days, so I'm intending to keep using heroin for 2 more days. Then I will have 4 days free. I'm going to go back into withdrawal.

I got clean in October and, with the exception of one slip in November, have stayed clean since then. I feel like I got out of the game at a good time as fent is everywhere and the pill game sounds beyond fucked lately. I don't have anything beyond anecdotal evidence to base this on, so I could be wrong. 

These past 6 months have been really great, and I've definitely gotten my life back together. I hardly have cravings for opiates, but I really want to smoke weed. I haven't smoked weed in about as long either. I'd really like to, but part of me is worried it may just restart the whole cycle again. 

I'm curious what people's experiences have been with some time away from opiates and then smoking weed. Did it cause any cravings for the good stuff? Were you able to just enjoy being baked? I realize everyone's different, but I'd like to get some first hand experience from people here.

Before any of you start yelling about the water soluble silicates in the pills and the dangers of ""Ritalin Lung"", I do an ethyl alcohol extraction that removes everything dangerous and leaves about 90-95% of the methyphendiate from the pills.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had ordered some tianeptine on Friday and got it today, I have been wanting to try some kind of almost-ball with the Ritalin but have always run through it before I got any opiods. Well this time the timing worked out. I ordered 5 grams of the tianeptine and shoot between 100-250 mgs per shot which results in a solid rush and the greatness that is opiate warmth.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When shooting Ritalin solo the results are a moderately cocaine-like rush then normal amphetamine speediness and alertness. Well these drugs must be synergistic because the sum was greater than the total of the parts in this instance. With normal speedballs I prefer to shoot the cocaine and the heroin separately because when shot together I feel like the rush of both drugs is slightly diminished.    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the tianeptine is so harsh on the veins I opted to shoot the drugs together.......which was the right move. I got the tianeptiune rush first, (which is odd as usually the stimulant side of balls presents itself first) and it was just as strong as usual. Then after almost a full minute I got the methylpendiate rush which defiantly felt more coke-like than usual, it also lasted longer than usual(which is great because the normal Ritalin rush already lasts like 5x as long as the cocaine rush).   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/10 for what it is especially since I get my Ritalin for $0 from Medicaid and the tianeptine is <$5/g. Will repeat once I come down and will update.

And a little background: I'm a 23 year old male and I've been on and off IV heroin since I was 18. I basically binge use for several months at a time, it takes over and fucks up my life, and I swear off of it forever. I've been clean for longish periods of time, including a 3 year stretch when I did the whole NA thing. This time around I was clean since September (and I deleted my Reddit account, I was a frequent poster on Opiates) without NA. I was a daily user of Kratom though, love that stuff. I'd see people rave about it on this sub all the time and i wrote it off that it was probably stupid/weak/placebo but I was totally wrong. Anyway, stupid me decided to buy and shoot some dilaudids a girl from work offered me a month ago, I tried to find more but couldn't, but I knew where to get heroin easily. So that's what I did, reluctantly. I've been shooting it for maybe two weeks now, and apparently I'm horrible at hiding it from people, my family and gf caught on pretty much immediately so I'm gonna have to stop. I'll use the rest of my stuff today and then use a subutex to come off of it. 

As you might know, the brain is divided into two hemispheres, the right brain and the left brain. Again, this is simplified, it is generally believed that the left hemisphere (which actually controls the RIGHT side of your body) is used for logic, solving math problems, language, memory, etc. The right hemisphere is used for creativity, spatial abilities, facial recognition, processing music, etc. I like to think of it in terms of your left brain is the very straight-laced, intelligent, business-man uncle of your family and your right brain as the free-spirited hippie-dippie uncle. 

The brain is obviously incredibly complex and it's amazing at its ability for efficiency. Honestly it blows me away thinking about it. It's like a naturally formed organic super-computer. Let me get to the point. I've been writing a song this morning that I'm super excited about, and I'm also high on heroin. In my experience, heroin enhances my creativity a lot and some of the best stuff I've written was made when I was high. It's actually a trigger for me, when I'm clean and I haven't written any new material that I'm proud of in a while I start wondering if I can just use heroin as a tool for songwriting, but it's just a fantasy bc I don't have the self control to just use it sparingly for only that purpose. 

Do you think opiates make your right brain/creative side more dominate? Like, make it easier to tap in to? Both parts of your brain has its pros and cons, you need both just as equally. But when I'm writing a song, like actually in the process, I feel like I need to turn off the logic portion of my brain bc I'll over-analyze what I'm doing or become self-conscience and doubt whatever I'm writing. But i need to turn that logic back on later to edit or proofread. 

I have other evidence that opiates make me more right brain dominate. I feel like I think with way less logic when I'm high and think with my emotions. And that has been awful at times. When I'm mad, my anger is intensified when I'm high and I can't work through it logically like I can when I'm sober. I'm normally a very mellow laid-back dude and I don't get angry easily. But heroin changes that instantly and I hate who I become. 

Anybody else agree or have a similar experience with opiates? Do you feel like opiates make your emotional/creative side more dominate than your logical problem-solving half? ",1462978075.0

I've taken opiates every day for the past 130 days with the exception of a couple of days off just to confirm that i am indeed not physically dependant.  I've seen a lot of posts from people who have used ultra low dose naltrexone (ULDN) with opiates to enhance analgesia/euphoria but virtually none on LDN with opiates. 

 Let me just clarify, i have a chronic pain condition and started using opiates first as pain killers then i abused them a lot because life can really suck with chronic illness.  I was very much physically dependant on opiates from about June last year until December and i abused them daily, be it some blend of tramadol, Poppy Seed Tea (PST), Codeine, Morphine or Oxy. I had a fairly high tolerance, though obviously tiny compared to some here.  Anyhow i had read that LDN could be a really fantastic drug for people with chronic pain conditions/auto immune diseases and i was pretty keen to try and get my life back on track.  

So i asked my GP for an LDN script and was told that i couldn't take LDN in conjunction with my Tramadol/oxy/morphine scripts but that he would prescribe me 50mg Naltrexone tablets off label if i weaned myself off all the hard opiates.  I then did a very rapid lope taper and was almost completely clean within 8 days and went back and got the 50mg Naltrexone. I made up a 1mg/1ml solution and started at 1mg of naltrexone.  I had taken my last dose of lope (for the record it's completely painless coming off opiates with a lope taper and i was able to get through with virtually no withdrawal symptoms at all.) a day ago and was a little eager given how long lope's half-life is as within 30 minutes of taking the 1mg of Naltrexone i felt some very minor withdrawal symptoms indicating opiates weren't quite out of  my blood.  Anywho i took some benzos and went to sleep and worked myself up to 4mg of LDN within a week or so.

The LDN worked wonders for my depression and i felt a 7 year cloud lift within the next week however the LDN did nothing for my pain.  Everything i've read has indicated that LDN and daily opiate use didn't go together however i still had a decent amount of tramadol and morphine so after 2 weeks of being on LDN i took some of both and got high all day which was fine.  Then come night time i took my 4.5mg of LDN and went to bed and was fine.  Obviously since i wasn't physically dependant on opiates the LDN was fine and didn't kick me into withdrawals.  Then the next day and every day since i have taken enough morphine or PST to keep a fair helping of pain at bay, and each night i take 4.5mg of LDN which clears out my receptors and i never become physically dependant.  The only reaction i get from the LDN is that my pain obviously comes back pretty quickly as my receptors are cleared out by the antagonist.  I can however still use as much as i want the next day and get all of the positive opiate effects. 

 These days i mostly just use PST for the pain as i've found it to be a far superior painkiller to the Morphine Sulfate i am prescribed.  I get high occasionally though it's a rarity these days as i'm fairly happy so it's mostly just analgesia i am after.   Still i think the LDN, apart from being an awesome mood enhancer is amazing and i'm so stumped that no one else seems to be doing this.  The physical withdrawals that i'm sure many here are familiar with is a major major drawback to opiate use, be it for the use of chronic pain relief or just as a drug to abuse.  I haven't felt withdrawals (except for that first night) since December and i've used almost every day this year.  I went 3 days without very recently just to prove my theory correct and my normal pain is the only symptom i felt. Anyhow this ended up far longer than i intended.  Hopefully this might help some of you if you want to have your cake and eat it too.

Steal from grandma and feeling guilty as fuck after? This life is hard. It's lonely and can be brutal and ugly. But I want to send you good vibes and lots of love.

There isn't enough positivity in this world and I want to be a positive part of this sub. I see so many people on here hurting one another and it can drown out all the good I see on here too. So I wanted to spread some good vibes. I'm not even high. Big hugs. Wish you all the best .

The majority of answers to this revolved around production cost, availability of resources, and difficulty to make when compared to heroin or full synthetic analogs. Overall none of these answers are true.

So, today I'll be teaching you how easy it is to make ~600mg of pure dihydromorphinone (aka hydromorphone or ""Dilaudid"") for less than $0.50/mg. For reference your typical 8mg Dilaudid will go for $10-75 on the streets depending on your area. I typically see them for $25-35.

I do not recommend trying this at home, this is all theoretical, but any fairly knowledgeable amateur chemist with the slightest determination wouldn't have trouble with it. I will not include specific pH or temperature values; I will only outline the process. Like the darknet I don't want this to be easy enough for anyone to do it, you'll need to use your brain and do some additional research. The main reason for posting this is to disprove the myth that our favorite pharmaceutical opiates are impossible to synthesize.

Below is a list of everything you'll need.

* **Morphine HCl - 1 gram**

**Cost to source: ~$100**

You can make this yourself fairly easily with pods or poppy seeds.I've found good quality unwashed seeds yield roughly 100mg/lb. You'll need 10lbs. I wouldn't buy more than four at a time. Iirc there is a brand popular with tea users that sells 10lb bags on Amazon, just do some research.


* **Palladium Black - 100mg**

**Cost to source: ~$10-20**

You can buy this from a lot of places on the internet for around $100/g. Many US places won't ship it to you unless you're a school/university/company but China sure doesn't give a fuck.

* **HCl (Hydrochloric Acid)**

You can buy this shit at Home Depot, use your head.

* **NaOH (Lye)**

You can buy this shit at Home Depot too, use your head.


Aside from the stuff listed above you'll need some glassware (or anything really), a stable/adjustable heat source, and coffee filters (a large leur lock with a filter makes everything easier though). Oh yeah, and an accurate milligram scale. Transfer pipettes too probably, you get the gist figure out what you're going to use to do each step ahead of time.

The process is insanely simple and to be honest the hardest part about it is getting the Morphine HCl out of the poppy seed wash.

* **Step 1**

Dissolve 1g Morphine HCl in slightly acidic HCl solution and add 100mg Palladium Black.

* **Step 2**

Reflux for three hours. I won't tell you the temperature range but it's easy to find and the hint is that it's between 60-90°C.

* **Step 3**

Filter palladium out and basify solution with NaOH.

* **Step 4**

Siphon off precipitated base solution and recrystallize with alcohol.


Congratulations, you now have roughly 600mg of pure Dilaudid powder. Now let's hope some darknet entrepreneurs see this and hop on it, just don't forget to share the love with the community.

**EDIT:** Forgot to include: The real reason people don't sell powder like this is because the majority of DNM suppliers don't actually make their shit. They buy it in bulk elsewhere (in the case of RC's, whatever China is making) and mark it up. The majority of them don't want to take the risk setting up UGL to synthesize highly regulated chemicals when they can make insane profits marking grey area RC's from $1/g to $40/g.",1462933679.0

If its the wrong, i would appreciate if u could direct me in the right direction.

So this is the story.

About two years ago, i got punched in the face during a soccer match. From this i got a Whiplash injury, concussion, broken front teeth.
Today, the concussion is gone, the teeth is fixed but i still have a ""chronic"" whiplash and problem with anxiety/depression cause of that.
I use antidepressants with doctors orders, and currently no pain relief medication.

I've tried (as pain reliefers):

Theralen
*Ibuprofen (Makes my stomach hurt, i have IBS)
*Lyrica
*Naproxen
*Paroflex
*Paracetamol
*Atarax

All of this above, have not worked for me or gave me to much bieffects.
Today, i have such a pain in my neck, stiffness in neck, right arm pain, right hand pain. Nerves is damaged in my neck that leads to that the right side of my body is not as strong as it used to be. My depression and anxiety (that is caused of the whiplash injury) is under controll. Sure i have my ups and downs, but so does every human being. My front teeth is today also fixed and under controll. BUT, the punch to the head also caused a brain damage. A name that doctors call it is ""cognivtive brain damge"". It makes it harder for me to deal with stress, read, write, follow instructions, be in high sound areas, surroundings overall and think like before. It's hard to explain but it feels like something is broken in my brain even thou it is not.

According to my doctor, theres no more drugs to test that can ease the pain which i know is not true. My question is, can anyone of u suggest what could help against my pain?

**I copied this from a earlier post i did in /r/drugs. They said that opiates probably will help. But im asking you guys, should u recommend it from a medical purpose? Such as tramadol etc. (i know many of u may have been suffering from addiction, and for that i am sorry.) 
Other then that, i would also like to ask, WHY did you get addicted to this? Do u come from a drug abuse before or was opiates the first and REAL drug that you both physically and mentaly got stuck with?**

I split from work right at 5 and hop on the highway to go cop (about a 30-40 min commute). I'm cruising along, no problems telling the dgirl I'll be there as soon as I can. I hit the half-way mark and everything is going fine, until it wasn't.

My car randomly starts making hellish growl (loud noise) and I'm suddenly start hearing a scraping sound. I keep cruising for about a minute not understanding what happened. I turn down the radio and confirm the scraping is coming from my car.

I throw on my hazard lights and pull to the side of the highway. I get out of the car in-between semis and cars speeding by me, seemingly ignoring the car on the side of the road. I walk over to the passenger side and lay on the wet ground and see my muffler has snapped in half and is laying on the pavement in the middle of my car. ""Fuck me"". 

Not thinking I grab the muffler, ""shit!"". It's hot as fuck. I get back in my car and grab some gloves I had bought just a few days prior. I check the muffler and it is sturdy on both ends of the car, just snapped in the middle. I unsuccessfully look for a bungie cord or anything sturdy that would help and find nothing. 

I call my only friend that is in the area and ask him if he has bungie cord, which he does, but he's not home...""fuck"". Running out of options and the dgirl blowing up my phone wondering where I am, I decide to un-lace my shoe lace and just use that. I know its not a long term fix, because the exhaust will probably burn right through the thin string, but I crawl back under the car and tie it up with my shoe lace.

The muffler is no longer dragging, so I figure I'm already half way and I don't want to be sick, so ill limp the car the rest of the way and hope for the best.

I get back on the highway, with my car now loud as hell, praying I don't get pulled over for the noise and praying the string doesn't snap or burn. I call the dgirl and tell her I was stuck in traffic but I was almost there.

By the grace of god no cops noticed the noise and the string held. I copped and got the hell home. Went inside, ""got well"" and hung my muffler back up using a bungie cord and a coat hanger. All in all, it wasn't a terrible day, I was able to cop and am now back home with a car that is louder than normal, but hopefully the muffler will hold until I can afford to get it fixed.

I hope you all have more luck today than I have had. Sorry for the novel, I just needed to vent. Happy nods.",1462925498.0

I felt myself flying forward in slow motion. I flip through the air and see the car explode and roll several times before things return to normal speeds and the last thing I realize is the car is really really far away. Cue Bright white light, Followed by darkness.

This part has been relayed to me by the EMT's that got me to the hospital, when they came back to visit me. I apparently put up quite the fight in the ambulance, it took them half the ride over to get an IV in me and strap me down. Pain fueled rage coursed through my body and I was not having any of what was happening. 
Then I snap back to reality and the sudden awareness of my state took hold.

Oh my god. Im in ambulance. ""What HAPPENED TO ME ARE THOSE MY LEGS! JESUS CHRIST MY BONES ARE OUTSIDE OF ME!! WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ONLY FOUND MOST OF MY KNEE"" God the pain, I begged them to knock me out at that point. I have never experienced anything like it. I just managed to squeak out I was on 12mgs of suboxone for 12 months and they cranked up my morphine dose. A warm blanket and I saw another Injection go in and I was out. 

After the Trauma surgeon fought for hours to save my life I was transferred to the ICU. My body was destroyed. Over 30 broken bones and 6 major surgeries were needed. The doctors there saved my life. They put me back together, god bless their hearts. 2 weeks and 9 days of which were spent intabated. When I finally came around I was choking on a breathing tube and all of my family was crying. Damn. After being the black sheep and kicked out and dragged back for rehab, and still not sober I didnt expect to see anyone.

I look down and see my body. An external stabilizer on my right leg. Feet covered in stitches. My right arm in a cast. God so much was broken, I couldnt move an inch. Now here's the part of the story I was in heaven for. My doctors reviewed my tox screen and suboxone history and decided 50mcgs of fentanyl every 3 hours was needed, a patch along with ativan shots whenever I asked. for almost an entire month I was so high I felt no pain. I felt nothing but bliss. All responsibilities, down to eating food and taking a piss were alleviated. the nurse would come in I would try to hit on her, she'd giggle (at me presumably trying, in my physical state) and she would crack open my fent ampule. She would glow like an angel and the rush would creep through my body and then flood like a tidal wave. 

I was alive. I was high. I forgot about crack entirely, and my focus returned to opiates. Tune in next time for pt. 3. The heartbreaking finale/up to present day.",1462921247.0

So I snort 5 bags a day on average, once or twice went up to a whole bundle. Usually take weeks on, weeks off, whatever, I'm not fooling anyone, it's fine.

When I use, I use all day. When I use all day, my days tend to follow a very similar pattern:

7:30AM: Shower, do a bag, exercise. Feeling energetic and capable.

10:00AM: Arrive at work. Craving cigarettes, still have plenty of energy and the high has leveled off. May do some tiny bumps to maintain.

1PM: I've probably done 2-3 bags at this point, but maybe less. Starting to feel 'stupid' and my conversational skills ebb. Perhaps losing energy. Still high.

3PM: Oh, here's the opiate rage. Smoking more cigarettes, probably growling ""come ON"" to myself as I sit in traffic. Yesterday I got mad while buying cigs at a vape store because they wouldn't shut up about pastry flavored smoke. 

5:30PM: Huge crash in energy. Totally numbed out in the same way I feel after an Adderall binge. Yesterday I met with an old business partner and she spent the whole time congratulating me on a huge recent success / venture. Best I could manage was a half smile and ""yeah it's pretty cool..."" It's an effort to talk. Going to the bathroom to snort half a bag will bring back some energy. Some. Have done about 4 at this point.

7PM: If I'm not home, I should be. Can at best mumble, people comment that I look very tired. As soon as I hit the bed, I'm out.

10:00PM: Wake up with plenty of energy. Eat something, shower and pass out. If im stupid, I do a line of dope but that's wasteful.


Wow what a dumb long winded way to ask the question: When doing dope all day, how do I prevent myself from transforming into an enraged emotionless narcoleptic? Nothing? Because that's just what heroin does?

I'm hoping this won't get me a lecture, as it has on other forums. Yes, I know how bad Heroin is, I know it's a slippery slope. You don't need to tell me... However, a question I do want to ask is - how the hell do I take this stuff? I'm not talking ROA but just taking it seems a task in its self for a newbie like myself.


I have ""0.1g/100mg"" of Heroin, of course that's assuming it's pure which... I'm not a druglord, so, let's just for the sake of arguing it's not.
Now, my plan is to do TINY bumps. I'm talking the size of a pinpoint until I get where I want to be. But, and here's my question, how long do I wait between bumps? How do I know when it's safe to try a bit more? Am I being too careful doing pinpoint bumps?

I'm not entirely naive to Opiates, I have a tolerance to 80mg-120mg morphine, 700mg+ codeine, 50mg-70mg Oxy. I'm not sure how that will help giving that I don't know it's purity, but it might be of use to someone.


Or would smoking be better for a naive person? The only two things I've smoked would be weed and cigarettes (2 packs a day usually), but I'm very experienced with coke, have done speed and crushed pills - so I feel snorting would be better for me personally, and easier to calculate for myself but perhaps not.",1463059532.0

The past few days I've been having these weird episodes (it's NOT nodding). It's almost like I'm blacking out or I'm having a dream but I'm awake. I'm talking,  up moving around and somewhat aware of what's happening. They're brief, seeming to last about 10 seconds to a few minutes, and I always snap back to reality and wonder WTF I'm doing. Some times I'll have trouble recalling what I did between the 5 minutes after banging and ""waking up"" though.

Last night for example; I repeatedly had conversations with my roommate only to turn to say something else to them and realize they're in bed sound asleep. Just as they had been for awhile. I caught myself in their room too, striking up a conversation with them as if they were awake. I was also having conversations with people that aren't even at the house. I had another incident in the kitchen where I snapped to, making myself a sandwich that I don't recall starting.

Another one from a few nights ago. I had just copped and done my usual routine where I mix the whole half G up at once and draw up what I'm going to do now. In the process. I'll sit my spoon in the floorboard so it doesn't get knocked over/spilled.

So I do my shot and start drawing up the remainder in another rig for later and... poof I snap back to being fully alert and conscious so to speak. I thought I was gone for a couple of minutes when in reality 30 minutes had elapsed. Without even thinking about it I start to head home only to get a half mile down the road to realize I had left the spoon in the floorboard with quite a bit still in it. It's no longer where I last put it so I start searching the car, knowing it had certainly spilled.

I couldn't find the spoon yet but I did manage to find the rig I had started loading before I mentally departed. It wasn't much, but I figured at least it wasn't a total loss. After a few more minutes searching the car I get my cigs out of my pocket and discover the spoon in there as well (naturally there's nothing left in the spoon). I don't remember much of anything between doing the shot and waking up. I must have been on autopilot though as I managed, regretfully, to put everything up.",1463059133.0

I've been in a rough place since November of 2015, when my father at 55 was diagnosed with Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I'm in my late 20s and although I have a secure and well-paying job, I am in a position where I am supporting my family as my dad took early retirement and my mom stays at home to support him. My sister is a NEET and does not work as well.

My dad has been prescribed an overabundance of oral hydromorphone and he uses it strictly for pain management. I caved in and started taking the pills recreationally twice or three times a week. It's always been in the 3-4mg range, but recently it has been 6 mg of the hydromorphone contin. 

It's been about 5 months now of recreational, 2-3x/week use and I have had enough. I'm disgusted with myself for doing what I have and can't even stand the sight of the pills anymore.

The last time I took the pills was 4 days ago, 6mg hydromorphone contin. Now I do have anxiety/depression because of my Dad's situation, and there may have been a slight elevation in those symptoms but I'm not too worried about that. I've been having cramping in my stomach/GI area, a chronic dull pain that has lasted 3 days now with some bloating. Constipation is not as bad as I am passing stool.

I'm wondering if this is a normal withdrawal symptom from going cold turkey. I imagine withdrawing from larger doses is a nightmare and this may seem tame in comparison but I want to kick this habit NOW and never look back.

Anyone with similar experiences with the GI issues? Thanks again.",1463055166.0

I don't know how many of y'all have seen this article yet, but it's a good read. & I think it's a damn good idea. It's basically somewhere safe someone can go when they're under the influence of whatever drug they're on. If you need medical help, you can get it. If you just want to mellow out and enjoy your high, well you can do that too. 

I think we need more places like this. I bet it would help save a *lot* of lives. Especially in the homeless communities, where they don't really have anywhere to go...

Hi Everyone, 

I am 31. It started when I was 25, taking a yellow perc just about every day. That went on for a long time, with my dose gradually increasing to reach where I want to be, at a max of about 8 per day. For the last year, I have switched over to snorting dope. At the start, 1 bag a day would get me blasted, even make me throw up. My tolerance obviously increased, and now I need about 7 bags a day just to maintain myself. I am sick of it. The worrying about not having any has consumed my life. I really really want to quit but the thought of going through WD is holding me back. I have had one night in the last year where I didn't have anything for the whole day and that night was the worst night of my life. The sweating. The Legs moving about uncontrollably. Everything about it was horrible. I know what I am doing now is unsustainable, so I really want to quit before I lose the love of my life, my live in GF. I have managed to hide it from her this whole time, but lately the drugs are affecting our relationship in really bad ways. I don't want to have sex. When we do, I never finish, so she thinks she is doing something wrong. I am running out of money. If I don't quit soon I am screwed. I guess my question is, what is my best route for recovery?? I do not have health insurance and am pretty low on funds, so any costly programs are out of the question. I am in NYC, so I am hoping in this big city someone out there has gone through something similar and succeeded. All help/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

Making an intranasal solution, how many units of liquid is a ""dose"" ? how much liquid is too much to snort?","So basically, I made an opioid solution to consume intranasally. It was this: 2.5~mg of buprenorphine, 40 units (.4ml) of bottled water that I added a very minute amount of table salt to increase its salinity, and boiled. I mixed in the powdered bupe to the saline solution once cooled. Stirred for only a few minutes max (wish I had patience to let sit longer. though I am unsure if that would help with solubility or not), then sucked it up into a 1cc insulin syringe (28g 1/2"" but I broke off the needle) through a piece of compacted cotton.
I was left with 40 units of clear orange liquid. I used an 8mg generic tablet of Suboxone. 

I had a liquid solution of suboxone the other day which I shot up into my nose from a needle-less insulin syringe and it worked surprisingly well compared to the other routes of administration.

Regardless, worked pretty damn well this time, as well. My question though, is how much liquid is too much, or more so:
How much liquid can sit on the surface of your mucus membrane? How much is *too much* ? when is the volume of liquid high enough that it will just run off and down into the throat?

I know this is *highly* subjective, depending on the size of their nose cavity, how hard they snort, method, etc. I'd just like a general idea, or even personal comments based on other's experience.

I say it cause of this: last time I had hardly any drip. This time, I had 40 units, and I snorted 15 units in one nostril, 15 in the other (leaving a remaining 10 units in rig). I tiled my head back the second time, which I actually felt CAUSED it to drip more down my throat. I stuck the syringe up past my nose hairs and breathed in while spraying. I think i couldve breathed in softer, as well.

Anyways, I feel it well (for the dose) , but I definitely tasted/felt some of that liquid drip down my throat pretty DAMN quickly after I snorted. Luckily, I just kinda drew that liquid into my mouth and stored it under my tongue for sublingual :P lol literally you can feel/taste it dripping into your throat, and your nose connects above you tonsils so you can just ""suck"" that ""drip"" into your mouth for sublingual. and its not drip as is in snot, its literally the saline/sub mix that I just shot/snorted too far and past the mucus membrane. Or the volume of liquid was too high and it was basically forced to run down my throat because the mucus membranes were already at full capacity.


I was contemplating using *more* water, for a more dilute solution, and just slowly consuming it. Id think the more dilute it is, the less chance of waste, as *long* as you dont take all of that liquid at once. Instead, snorting/spraying just a small amount at a time, and waiting til it absorbs.

The reason I decided *against* a more dilute solution is because bioavailability also depends on concentration. So a less-dilute (or highly concentrated) solution would have a higher BA, and would hit me quicker. So I went for a higher concentration versus lower, right under 3mg for 40 units (2/5 of a 1cc insulin syringe) so the amount that *would* absorb would have a higher concentration of bupe and thus hit me quicker, and better.

My plan was to just snort a small amount at a time, so it wouldnt drip. The first nostril I felt a slight burn, etc. when I went to do the 15 units in my other nostril, I tipped my head back more and snorted a little harder. after putting my head upright was when I could taste it dripping only a bit down my throat. Not too much at all, though. Although the amount of liquid was *also* small. I wouldve sprayed less, but I honestly couldnt even feel it as I was spraying it up there, so I didnt think I sprayed as much as I did. (though I wasnt planning on spraying much less than 15 units originally anyway, as its such a small amount)

so, how much liquid do you think is efficient to put up your nose at a time? What would possibly be the ideal volume to snort at a time, to let sit and absorb? How long should you wait in between intranasal doses?

Im thinking between 0.5-1.00 unit a nostril, And then give it at least 5 minutes, prolly 5-20 minutes, before attempting to spray anymore liquid up your nostrils if you intend to dose higher.

Also, I've read that alcohol (of the ethanol variety) is a vasodilator and people have mixed it into intranasal sprays before. It also increases the absorption rate into the body as well as bupe's solubility in water. Anyone ever make a nasal spray with bupe and mixed a bit of 40%+ ethanol in it?
Im especially interested because of the vasodilator properties which would aid in quicker absorption through the mucus membranes. Ive used vodka for sublingual before and it does work, as has been proven numerous times to increase SL BA.
obviously, it'll burn a bit. Im not talking about a lot here, though, maybe mixing like half of a unit of 45% vodka into another 3-4 units of saline/water. Anyone here ever try that or have any opinions or reports on it? I *have* read about ethanol being added to intranasal solutions, would just love to hear some personal reports on the experience and if it'll be worth it. Im almost outta subs and as much as I enjoy the moodlift I am absolutely doing this to make what I have last longer and to taper more efficiently.

I had a question about markings on the 30 mg oxycodone ALG 265 pills- I was hoping if anyone had any they could take a look at theirs and see if they match mine.

If you hold the pill upright so the ALG (and the 265 under it) is straight and perfectly centered, and look on the back...is the break line a straight line? The pills I have have a break line that is more diagonal (one looks like this ' / ', and the other is the same but points in the opposite direction like this ‘ \ '). I'm not too familiar with this brand, but with other brands the break line usually lines up with the pills (so—just using this pill’s markings for an example-- if you broke it in half one half would have the 'ALG', the other half would have the '265'). It didn't seem normal to me that if these pills were legit made in a factory, that I would have two of the same brand pills with lines pointing in the opposite direction.

I hope this makes sense- it's a bit hard to explain! If anyone has this brand and wouldn’t mind checking it out for me and letting me know what the normal break line is (i.e.; horizontal, vertical, or diagonal like mine), I would truly appreciate it! Thanks in advance!",1463021049.0

Truely from the bottom of my heart.,"Apologies, in the sincerest possible way, I am very sorry fellow reddit opiate addicts. Last night and most of today I was being a complete and utter shithead. I was pissy and took it out on the community... and that's not fair to you guys. 

To me, at least, there is no worse feeling than having plenty of dope in my kit, clean equipment, AND the privacy to calmly cook up a shot and do it at your own pace, and low and behold you just can NOT get a register, you stick yourself 30 times, and an hour later you say fuck it and give up. 

Also, myself personally, I just don't have it in me to try to salvage a shot that is full of blood which over the past hour of, increasingly angry attempts, has turned basically black I just chalk it up to a loss and pitch it.

So, over the course of all of yesterday from 9am to the shitty sleep I got and into all of today up to about 20 minutes ago, I wasted about a gram and a half of dope and then this morning the 7 super fat cottons I'd been saving up from anytime I have a larger stash and don't squeeze every last drop out of them lol

Since I first began IV use (approximately 4 months or so again, so I'm still pretty noobish at it) I've tried 29 gauge, 1/2"", with a 1ml barrel; 31 gauge, 5/16"", 1/2ml, 29 gauge, 1/2"", 1/2ml and just couldn't find one that worked well.... especially since my veins suck to begin with even before I began this habit... I've had nurses tell me my veins are shit all my life lol. The rigs would either be too long and I'd have trouble getting in there without going thru it, or they'd be too small and would get clogged or be too flimsy and my veins would roll away from it, and I noticed that for me at least, 1/2cc barrels just suck for whatever reason even tho I only use 40 units water. 

So today I went and got some dope and some fresh rigs and tried 30 gauge, 5/16"" needle and a 1ml barrel. I believe I found my ponyboy lol they don't have 29g in the shorter needle, which I think would be even better but I think this will work fine.... the little bit more beef to the needle over the 31 made it puncture much better and not clog, as I still had to stick myself 3 times, the shorter needle made it so it didn't go thru my vien, and the bigger barrel seemed to have more of a vacuum to it and as soon as a registered I knew instantly. 20 min prior to starting this post, I had the best, most clean hit I've been able to give myself to date. I am now zen lol. 

So in summary, once again, my sincerest apologies to the few of you I was being a complete assbag towards. I'm sure some of you have been there, especially while sick... which like I said it was 100x worse cause not only was I sickly, but I was also throwing the megalixer in the trash, time and time again. I'm sorry. 

TL;DR: I'm an asshole. I am sorry. I love/hate heroin. 

P.S. you guys are a very supportive community. I rarely see judgement towards people for their use or the fucked up shit some may do to aquire a fix. You all also are supportive towards people quitting. Very kind group or people who understand and don't berate those who slip up. You just tell them to get back on the horse. Thank you for reading and have a great night. I think I'ma stay off reddit for a few days while my daughter visits starting tomorrow. See you folks when I see you.

What happened in the final just made me laugh out so loud, even during withdrawals which is pretty rare. He gets brought into some kind of rehab and the Doctor there gives him a 'wonder' medicine which makes all the pain and suffering during cocaine withdrawal go away. Now it comes.

I mixed the crushed powder in maybe 300ml of water, let it sit in the freezer until ice cold. Then the fridge.

After this I used 2 soaked breathing masks (you know the basic ones you see people in China wearing a lot) with a folded tissue in between to filter twice.

There was a lot of sludge left in the filter the first time, none the second time...but the end result was slightly cloudy.

Did I do something wrong or is it most likely filler. I drank it slowly over 20 minutes as I am basically opiate naive and at no point did any sediment form in the glass.

I used cyclizine and some quinine tonic water for potentiation.

Is a bit of cloudiness normal and is my makeshift filter good enough? I don't have access to coffee filters.

I used to use ibuprofen/codeine but the coating is a thick white so it's difficult to tell what the final product actually looks like.

I've relapsed slightly here or there. But I got clean from a gram a day dope habit (really good ECP IV) by going onto 3 subs a day. even that high of an anount the transition was hard. I've gotten myself down to 2 a day but I generally need those 2 a day I take one in the morning and one at night and by the time I take those only 12 hours apart im sick as a dog. 

But my parents still think that I am using because I often nod throughout the day. My parents at the same time of me saying I needed to get off dope wanted me to quit my xanax and Adderall scripts I was taking 60mg of Adderall a day and 2mg of xanax a day. I've been basically tapering all 3 because just trying to dead stop made me go crazy for a little and I was like manic for a few weeks so my parents understand I need to go slow. 

But the otter day I was nodding out on mothers day and then my mom finds coke in my room. She's an idiot and doesn't know what any drugs are she's found dope packets and didn't know what they were and threw them away. Generally she can tell something is a drug but has no idea what drugs look like. So the coke was just left over from me trying to sell back when I still did drugs I bought an quarter and it was my last gram I didn't want to flush and waste the money so I hide it. 

So like always whenever I nod and she thinks I'm high she goes threw my room tearing it apart the next time I leave the house. Now she thinks I'm using drugs again. Which I do still do cocaine occasionly and the night before that had done a few bumps out drinking with friends. 

But idk how to explain to my mom. I want to be honest but i don't want to be like yeah I sell coke. (It's not a constant thing it's just to get rid of personal stash from when I was using heavily. Wasn't uncommon to use a gram of coke along with my gram of dope I was doing daily) 

but she keeps seeing me nodding out and now even at work im doing it. Is it from the subs? Is it from the fact I quit a high amount of Adderall. I never really thought I had adhd in fact I really lied because I would often fall asleep in school and was just always tired. It's been common all my life to sleep like 10 hours a night. Idk what to do. It's weird tho on opiates they often would wake me up much more than now without them. Some days I come into work and I nod from like the morning until lunch time.

I've been lurking around here for along now. I see all these amazing post of people being clean for months hell years even. They need a round of applause, because the first few weeks are hell literally. I've been fighting with the opiate gods for a long time now.

So now we start with me, good ole me, I'm 25 have a decent job working at a receiving dock been there 4 years but more on that later. When I was 10 I lost my only older brother in a car accident he was 23. So my mom went pretty much into full depression for a few years, and was prescribed xanax. Curious little me wanted to see what they were so I took a few, wow middle school couldn't have been better, if i would of remembered it. Well I start going to a friends house and man his mom got all kinds of shit bars, methadone wafers, whatever. We were 13 years old doing this shit wait until his mom would nod out and bam so were we 20 minutes later. That didn't last to long before him and his parents had to move out of state. So here I am going to high school still smoking weed but tried to stay away from the pills as much as I could. Well then my senior year I was T boned and fractured a vertebrae. So the doc say here have these Norco 10s and that's when it all started... 

After I graduated school I just went to work in factories because who knows what they want to do when they are an 18 year old drug addict lol. So you know the drill anyone and everyone at shitty factories have something. Well I would buy this dude boxes and trade for op 40, or just buy them, he didn't take them you probably know why. Well those lasted awhile until the dude quit and moved away for work. So I go a month or 2 sober then one of my good friends hits me up says he's got meth. Well I've really never been a big fan of the stuff, but I go get all geeked out anyway lol. So were messing around with that for a few months and shit really started to hit the fan. I lost my job, couldn't make. my truck payment, yea don't do meth lol.

So I get the job I'm at now and everything's cool I'm clean working 3rd shift as a temp working my ass of trying to stay focused. Well I get full time day shift and yes life is looking good. But this job does a number on the lower back, moving barstock stacking pallets and climbing up and down off a forklift whew lol. Anyway I meet this other dude he's a hell of a dude can get op 40, 60, dones whatever. Has been steady for years now which is good and bad I suppose ;) 

I really think its time for me to clean up I've had my fun. I'm just really glad i stuck to pills and not dope mostly because its shit around here. Anyway I've rambled on for awhile now. I think I'm going to try going to sub route.

STOP TEXTING YOUR DAMN DEALER. When dealer (or you) gets busted, LEO gets a warrant to search their phone. Then the crime lab compiles the texts, pics, & websites visited into a sophisticated software program that's easily printable for introduction in court. At the state level, aside from controlled call with a CI or child victim, I've never had LEO actually record the convo (although the cops in my major metro area are notoriously incompetent and corrupt). The most they do is collect the times of the calls and which cell tower the call pinged off..At the Fed level, they'll audio record everything, video tape whatever they can, and try to get everyone including your own mama to testify against you. Basically, if the Fed's bring a case, you're going to spend some time in club Fed. Last I checked, there's a 96% conviction rate up there. At the state level, I'd say I get about half my cases dismissed outright bc of shitty, half-assed police work--in addition to the fact that I'm fucking awesome. 


Of course, all the above info could be wrong now that state and local police have access to ""stingrays."" Google that shit... very Orwellian.

I'm extremely curious, though... Does eating while high lessen the high at all? I IV heroin. I try to use on an empty stomach but typically I use at night after having not eaten all day, and sometimes I'm really hungry and cave and eat. Or I'll hold off eating until I do my shot, but dope makes me sooo hungry and I'll cave and eat and then worry that the food is going to lessen the effects. 

So does eating before use actually lessen the effects of opiates? Should you use on an empty stomach, when IV'ing? Does it matter at all? What about eating once you're already high- does it take away any of the effects of the drug?

It might seem weird that I can't answer this myself but it's super hard for me to tell when it comes to things like this, and it's so easy for me to talk myself into feeling placebo effects. Ie: did a shot 20 minutes ago. Now eating a slice of pizza and pissed at myself for eating.

On the bright side! I've lost a good bit of weight recently and continue to slowly shed it off!

Start with the sub.


Stretch it over five days, starting with a larger piece and incramentally decreasing size till I am done with it. 


Wait 32 hours and switch to the methadones.


Start with a full pill.


On the second pill I'd split it in half, one half per day.


The third pill I'd split it in thirds, one third a day.


The fourth I'd split it in fourths, one fourth a day.



For the remainder of the withdrawls I would compensate with lope.

Up until now the only opiates I've been using are percocets and hydromorphones. Most of the time I snort it for the high and the most I've done is somewhere between 20-30mg.

The other day my guy says that he has no perc's but he has Opana 30mg ER's (the concave pink/brown ones with an E imprinted on one side and a 30 imprinted on the other). I was skeptical at first but I was told that they were the holy grail of opiates so I went ahead and bought them.

Fast forward to this morning I discover that these are impossible to crush without a dremel or a ped-egg so I gave up on trying to get it to a fine powder and just took it orally. After about an hour to an hour and a half later I begin feeling nauseous so I go to the bathroom and puke. I do this about 2 more times to the point where there is no longer any food in my stomach.

Usually after puking this much i usually deem it safe enough to consume food/drinks again so I drink some water because I feel dehydrated. Unfortunately I was wrong about the fact that I could drink so I puke again, and nothing but clear water comes out. For the rest of this ""high"" I avoid drinking and eating and i dry heave regularly roughly every 30 minutes.

Looking back I probably took too much for my first time using an Opana and I still have several left so I was wondering if there are any other methods other than using a power tool or a ped-egg to make it into a fine powder.

I've been stuck on bupe ever since I traded it for oxy. With every drug test I take I am always in fear that it will be on the test. I work in healthcare, so if anyone was to be tested for all things under the sun pre-job, it would be me. most places nowadays are call you for an interview TOMORROW, and DTing right there on the spot. Not much time to clean up. 

But today I took my...4th...health care related nursing drug screen. My first was in nursing school. Passed.  Second was pre employment for my first nursing job. Passed. 3rd was an HPP Comp 1 specifically designed to test for prescriptions of abuse to catch nurses who are diverting. (I wasn't diverting. Passed.) And then today was my 4th....knew within 5 minutes that I had passed.

So I guess in the past I've had a hard time finding concrete info on whether suboxone shows in a professional job's pre employ screen. Mixed bag of responses, and very few of them to boot. So whenever this gets archived hopefully I can help someone in need, or if I'm lucky, someone already on the forum.

The TL;DR is: Will Suboxone test pos for opiates? NO. Never ever ever. Will Suboxone in and of itself be detected? Probably not, unless you're going to work for NASA or a company with a lot of money to throw away on bupe-specific 12-15panel tests.",1463073013.0

So, I have been in a methadone program for only about 1 week - since last Monday, so really 6 full days.  I started at 30mg then 10mg more the first day.  Then 50mg Tuesday. 55mg on Wednesday, then 60mg on Thursday which is where I want to stay because it felt like a good dose.  I am not getting sick, nor am I ""getting a high"" off of the dose.  I felt like I was at a good place.

Well, this morning I get up as per usual.  I get dressed, go to the clinic, dose my 60mg - same as yesterday.  Well, me and the SO are driving to (his) work and I start feeling gassy.  Which is kinda normal, because my stomach is always ""most active"" in the mornings. Especially since I had been drinking a DD coffee. I start to feel a headache and take 2 ibuprofen in the car.   I walk him in, he clocks in, and we say Goodbye.  I get home and start to really feel naseous and I couldn't help it.  I just puked up basically everything I had eaten the night before.

Now..........my question.  I dosed at exactly 6:33am and puked at around 7:15am - is that enough time so that the methadone has worked its way into my system?  Should I call the clinic and ask for advice?  I have my take home dose for Sunday (tomorrow) but I really don't want to double dose if I don't have to. Especially if I get sick again.


Has this ever happened to anyone before?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also, just as an FYI - I don't think I have a stomach virus or anything because right after puking I feel totally fine! I'm wondering if it was the combo of ibuprofen and coffee in an otherwise empty stomach? 

I just hope I'm okay! WD's suck and I really want to stick with this treatment program.  I want to be well and ""normal"" again one day! Thanks in advance for all the answers and responses!",1463225243.0

I feel like if I don't try it I'll always be curious which would increase my risk of relapse and I'm planning to stay sober after rehab. 

I have 3 years of mild recreational opiate experience, but the last 6 months I fell into everyday use of mostly Oxy and Trams and I'm now physically addicted. I am experienced with Codeine, Tramadol, Buprenorphine and Oxy.

I'm of the OC now (switched to Bupe and Tram) but on a day off I eat/snort about the equivalent of 160mg Oxy.

------------------------

So to my question. I will be sniffing, do you think that heroin will affect me alot more than other opiates? What is a good dosage? (Ofc I will be working my way up dosage wise) I'm planning on getting 1g of brown Heroin, how long would that last me aprox.? ",1463224449.0

Before I started on the codeine, I was a total mess.  Since I started  I have a great new job, I have found someone I hope to be my life partner, my digestion actually works, and I could sleep which is merciful.  I haven't made any dodgy new friends because I get the prescription from the doctor.

My partner went on vacation so I thought it would be a great time to try to give up my dependency while she could not see me form a sluglike pool of my former self.

This is day seven now and I am not convinced.  My arthritis pain has returned.

I also have some symptoms which are withdrawal related.  I have been sneezing a lot; constant diarrhea; and I have killer headache.  I cannot sleep.  Mood is very low too.

The problem is I had all those symptoms chronically before I ever started on opiates years ago.  Having a stable prescription really seems to have patched me up.

I am worried that my life and work will suffer from having quit.  This seems really backwards given the mainstreams consensus that opiates are bad for you.  Would really appreciate your thoughts.",1463219867.0

It's now about 3am, I am the absolute sickest I have ever been in 5 years. The kid can't get himself to throw up so now he doesn't have the bags and nobody else is around at this time.

It's now 4 a.m. and I go to this kid's house and of course the guy isn't answering Kama we wait a few and then I say fuck it and go home.

Today was a good day, even though it started out with a weak tone. 

Thus dboy had owed me a 40 bag for two days now with the excuse that he ran out the other night and told me he'd have more the next day. Well two days of the next day go by and he finally tells me to come on down like I'm on the fucking price is right and I just picked the lowest price without going over. So I get in my gilape and make the 30 minute drive to dopeville in my usual happy demeanor that we all get when we know we're about to be feeling good. 

I finally arrived at the happy yet sad part of town and proceed to ring him up. That optimism turns into anger when the asshole operator responds with an instant fuck you ""the person you've reached..."" without any rings. 

Fuck this asshole instantly comes out of my mouth as I proceed to call him another 10 times and it finally actually rings. When this happens you return to the previous optimism and that pre-dope neurotransmitter activation returns to previous levels. However it will still be another 30 calls of ringing without any answer over the following 45 minutes which felt like hours. 

I find a spot on the road where he's been for the past week. I Park near what I believe to be his house and keep my eyes locked on his spot hoping to catch him serving someone else so I can get his attention and prove he's been ignoring me over anyone else. 

I wait and wait and finally say fuck my life, this is pathetic and proceed to start my car and hope I can get someone to flag me down for a sample in the land of drugs and litter. After not even five minutes of that bullshit he finally calls. ""Fuck me"" I said. ""Thank Bob I didn't get on the freeway"". I rush my ass back to his street and finally get my sweet sweet drugs that I really don't need. 

After I see him he apologizes for the wait and I say ""no problem man, it's all good"" when I am really thinking.  ""Fuck you for making me wait for this delicious narcotic you fucki asshole"". 

I run back home and not even two hours in by and I am contacted by another dope boy I had not heard from in over a year. He explains that he just got out of felon detention and wanted to give me a tester. ""Fuck yes, I'll be there in 20"" I said. Not another 15 minutes goes by and another relic from the past gets on the line and said he's also got one for me! 

Of course these guys are close to each other since they all seem to be in the same low income neighborhood which is where all the good hard drugs are to be had. 

Between the two I ended up with nearly a gram of dope. The first guy gave me a legit half g and told me to let him know how it is. The second guy gave me like p25. This has not happened in a long time and I don't think I've ever had two guys give me free shit within an hour of each other. 

Now it's lot an 80 gram ground score thay the other dude from Europe got, but damn if I'm not dancing in the street without a scare in the world. 

The first sample turned out to be fucki fire, like an 8/10 and I'm very judgemental when it comes to my x/10 scale. I never give anything a 10/10 unless it's absolutely pure pharmaceutical grade heroin so 8/10 is insanely good. The second shit is mediocre and might be cut with fent but I'm not complaining. 


So I had a happy day for the first time in a long time. I hope everyone else is having as much of a wonderfully intoxicated say as I did. And tomorrow is going to be even better because I picked up a couple Benzedrex inhalers and plan on eating thay nasty cotton and writing a ton of new material so hopefully I'll have some new fiction to share with everyone.

Man did I freeze like no other.. Let alone I just moved in with him in Dec. And I was clean for 7 months before I picked up, and I have recently told him about my passed use. Then today a lot of stuff was going on at home, I just got off a 12 hr night shift 8pm-8am and couldn't stay home when I got home because landlord was coming and I couldn't be seen here cause I'm not mentioned in the renting thing. But I forgot to mention I didn't sleep the day before work also didn't come home right when it was okay to come back home, and a little time goes by talking normal... Then walks into garage and walks back in the house and say that, then says ""I can see it in your eyes"" and before he caught me he said awhile back I don't ever want drugs in the house, or I'm kicking you out. So being that he popped the question, or whatever I'm like hella scared I'm about to be on the road again (isn't my first time, but its terrible) so I'm like frozen don't know what to say, and then I just completely opened up, and he is more then willing to help me out to get sober without going to rehab.

Out of nowhere he says ""We want you to stay healthy so we can keep feeding you bro"".  
""Come again?"".  
""I just got my pretrial leg band off. Beat a trafficking charge. We're working hard for you cats man"".  
""Well,congratulations"".  
""Whats your thing? It's the boy isn't it? You gotta be careful man, there's a lot of
garbage going around here. What's it called? Fentanyl? My people don't mess with that"". 
The encounter was bizarre and interesting enough be it this guy telling the truth or not because if not, I've never met a mentally unstable person who's delusion was that they are a drug trafficker.  
In response to him being proud his people didn't mess with fent, I wanted to say ""So you want a cookie, but anyways.  
The conversation went on a bit longer.
I was confused the whole time.   
At the end he said ""Man your a good dude, tall and you got them curls too. Looking good""
I thought   
""Why thanks, I agree!"".    
I do feel my height and curls are part of my feature package and I try to embrace my qualities even when I feel like garbage.     
""We could get pussy together man"".  
Doubtful man, your just on a lot of cocaine. I don't think we fancy the same women, but thanks"".   
""You want a beer man? Lemme buy you a beer. I wanna give back to you guys when I can. I appreciate you"".   
I grabbed a Busch Ice and we checked out. In line he scolded me about my hand and checked out my veins. Huh.
I guess he felt free to tell the cashier about my hand. He was an ""OG"" so I guess that was supposed to make me feel at ease. Whatever though 
He walked outside with me and well, I did ask him for drugs which he replied  
""Do I look like a dope dealer? I'm a trafficker"".  
This was kind of funny because he absolutely looked like a drug dealer.    
After a few more words of wisdom and a lot more ""Thanks man. Stay safe. I appreciate you""s
He handed me my beer saying ""I would have bought you more beer man"". 
Then we bid each other and went our separate ways.    
It was an odd conversation, but hey,free beer!",1463193393.0

So today my sister got paid today, and I knew this so last night it was impossible to sleep last night; I was suffering from Christmas Eve syndrome. So I eventually do sleep and Im up at 9am. My sister and I leave the house to go to the hospital. If anybody has read my recent posts youll be aware that my mother is very very sick. So my sister, my aunt, and I are all in and out of mom's room, having the difficult conversation of end of life care and wishes. Unbeknownst to us, the hospital's chaplain has mom on his schedule this morning. So he comes in and asks if we would like any spiritual help. I say nothing, as its not my place, and my aunt begrudgingly allows him to say a couple of prayers for my mother's sake. She seemed to like the prayers, actually, so no issue with me. After all was said and done he went around the room and, with his thumb, draws a cross on each of our foreheads while reciting a few lines. I dont know what that is called, but again, besides the point. 


So its time to leave and I have to drop my sister off at work. I do so, get her debit card, and I am off to my boy. I asked her if I could borrow some money to go on a date. She gives me permission and I take $60 out for 15 bags. I finally get to the spot and my boy throws me two buns (20 bags) instead of the 15! I knew this right away but of course I text him about it only when Im well on my way home. He said he knows and to not worry about. Junkie Jesus was certainly smiling down on me. 


So, I am at a Dunkin Donuts. I go inside their personal bathroom (yes! privacy for the win) and take out 4 bags to shoot up. I think, hmm... and go for a 5th bag. Big mistake on my part, and I fucking know better. I feel the most amazing rush that is strong, but not knocking me on my ass. I put everything away and go to the counter and order two donuts. Then Im on the floor laying on my back attempting to get up. The employees are telling me to relax and I hear them on the phone with 911. I tell them not to worry, that I am fine, and they eventually believe me... but the 911 call was already made. I had my bags and rig in my loose hoodie pocket and my phone in my much tighter pants pocket. I get out the door and into my car and start to drive off when one of the women from the store runs out to give me my PHONE back. I thank her and start sweating as I check my hoodie pocket. The dope and rig are still there, somehow. She tells me ""It looked like you werel having a seizure!"". I think hm, strange. I thank her again and continue to drive away when an officer of the law steps up to the side of my car. I see his face through a rainy window just as I finish rolling it up. 


I put the car in park and roll the window down again. I am dying on the inside. This is it. I am fucked beyond repair. For one, the dope and rig are tight inside my left hoodie pocket, so any attempt to take it out would be seen. And even if I could secretly take it off my person, I had no feasible way of putting it in a good hiding spot in case they were to search the car. And they probably will, because:


I had just gotten my license taken away for a DUI (alcohol). I want to cry at this point. The officer is very nice. Asks if I feel okay and what happened. I told him that I had a dizzy spell and must have fainted. I told him I was very stressed about my mother being in ICU. I mention that that is where I am off to, and that it is in a town 45 minutes away. He tells me to drive safe... and that was that. I drove off. I am sitting in a parking lot about 10 minutes away from the hospital now. Visiting hours are closed from 6p to 8p, so I have time to waste at am shopping outlet, and more importantly to digest what the fuck just happened and to share it with all of you. 


So, yeah. /u/oh_no_five_oh just how lucky was I? I have not ever heard of a cop so disinterested in at LEAST checking things out. Not to mention the fact that I was still technically in town, though the very very outer edge of it. And for anybody that picks up in that city, watch out for the red lettered stamp ""FedEx"", 5 bags clearly put me on my ass when it honestly shouldnt have given my tolerance.

So I've been struggling with chronic pain for years, I'm somewhere around the 20's recently diagnosed with Chronic pain due to Fibromyalgia, My Fibro was trauma induced and I'm begging to believe it is MS due to mobility issues, Anyways I finally got health insurance and desperately need to see a doctor and be put on pain meds (hopefully) But my problems is that I've been forced to self-medicate in order to be able to work (can hardly walk, leg pain/weakness) among other things. So I have been using Poppy Seed Tea, and various pills from friends (morph and oxys) and kratom. The problem is I have no car and have to walk to go anywhere, and in order to be able to function without agonizing pain and mobility issues, I have to use... Getting to the main point, I really need to get to a doctor (primary) but in my past experience at E.R.s (before I was insured) they would always get pee from me and sometimes blood and I'm pretty sure they check for opiates because prior to being diagnosed I went to the E.R. quite a lot as I was suffering, and also I once went into the E.R. and told them I felt like I was withdrawing from Tramadol (not prescribed to me) I always thought my pain was from withdrawals until I stopped takin opiate's for a few months and realized I had an actual pain problem. So I'm sure Doctors are going to be weary of all those things. I'm really concerned, I don't know what to do should I just goto my primary Doc (havent met them yet) and tell them the truth? I'm afraid of them being unwilling to perscribe narcotics to me because of what happened in the e.r. and self-medication. I really fear not being allowed to be perscribed pain medicine as it is the only thing that helps. The pain and mobility and transportation makes it damn near impossible to go there without some from or opiate in my system and waiting 3 days for the ops to clear is too much to bear. I'm aware of Methadone and Bupe but I'd much rather try just pills before trying those, but then again pills seem to work less and less and I have to take mmore and more. But based on the circumstances should I just be honest tell them the truth and opt for bupe or meth? I can't hold a job or realtionships, and I'm on the verge of being kicked out due to not being able to work anymore. I also really need to see a doctor because I literally feel like I'm dying and think its something more devious the Fibro and now my tolerance is skyhigh from all the poppy seed tea and oxys. So if I withdraw it's going to be worse. Sorry for the autobiography, please tell me which route I should go.. Should I tell the truth? Should I lie? Should I just opt for Meth or Bupe due to my tolerance? I need to get my life back... I really do appreciate all advice and input even the negative, Sorry for the slop post I'm a wreck.

I recently got myself some U47700 mostly out of curiosity. I've done it twice in the last month, and while it's fun with a great rush, it's not really my cup of tea for a few reasons: it gives me mild respiratory depression even at moderate doses; the high doesn't last that long, even when eaten; it is so potent and takes so little that dosing can be frustrating, I've been considering cutting it with baking soda just to make dosing easier (I am highly sensitive to drugs, see #2 below). It feels more like a party drug, whereas what I'm looking for is less of a strong/fun rush, but more of a chill and even high for the evening/night.

I'm not really interested in H, because of my high sensitivity to drugs I'm afraid that even small doses will be crazy strong (~2x as strong as U47700 iirc), and also because of its notorious addictiveness/horrible withdrawals. In the past I've been lucky with finding cheap hydrocodone, and could just sit on them and take 1/2 when I wanted to feel good, but the only pills I've seen lately have been stupidly expensive so I'm looking for alternatives. 

**TL;DR is there something out there that is longer lasting than U47700 with less of a respiratory depression effect? Mostly just looking something for special occasions and getting over rough hangovers.**

PS some questions/relevant things of note here:

1. On the note of respiratory depression, I get this even at moderate doses, where I feel like sometimes my body just 'forgets' to breathe occasionally and I have to do it manually. I'm not suffocating or even close, but I can get winded easily and feel like I have a hard time getting deep breaths. It's frustrating and mildly disconcerting. Is this kind of respiratory depression is normal with all strong opiates, or is just particularly bad with U47700?

2. I am really sensitive to most drugs. It usually takes me 1/4 to 1/2 of the dose that it takes most people to do the trick, almost across the board. For example, 2.5 mg of Adderall provides 12+ hours of rocket fuel to me and can even be kinda tweaky at times. I have been smoking weed almost daily for about a decade, and can still get fuckin ripped on two or three hits; a gram will last me like 2 weeks if I'm just smoking by myself. The only exception is alcohol, and that's probably just because I drink a fair bit.

3. Opiate highs are a rare treat for me, usually only for special occasions or alleviating brutal hangovers. I am not and have never been addicted, or had serious withdrawals, despite ample opportunities. I am the kind of person who can hang on to oxy or hydrocodone for months without even thinking about it. I consider myself extremely fortunate and lucky to be like this, as I have friends who have extremely addictive brains and have seen them go through some real shit with the same stuff (ironically, I'm totally addicted to weed and have a really hard time quitting, lol).

The first few days were okay, but now I'm starting to lose that determination and its getting to me. I thought after a week the symptoms would calm down, but they're still full force.

The worst symptom for me is the physical anxiety and the RLS, I absolutely CANNOT sit still for more than 5 minutes and it fucking sucks. I'm also just super fatigued, feel cold all the time, have chills/hot flashes and sweating depending on the temperature, can never fucking get comfortable, diarrhea and vomiting, and I just feel really lifeless. I know this is all normal but I went into the taper and first few days of w/d feeling really determined but now all that has faded away.

How much longer should this last?? I really just want this god damn physical, chest tightening anxiety and restless limbs to go away. It's the absolute worse. I can deal with the other symptoms. I just wish this didn't last so long. Back on heroin after 4-5 days I'd be mostly good, mainly just super fatigued and drained the rest of the week. But this just drags on and on.

Edit 2 ********** found a place that will take me despite the methadone. Got my dose lowered to 30 mgs (I had brought it back up to 40mg from 30 mg last week, lol... so now right back down to 30mg), tomorrow I'm getting my last dose letter and heading straight to the detox. So I'll see you guys once I'm out. Take care of yourselves. ❤️


-------------



Blindsided. Showed up at home this morning at 8 am after getting dosed at clinic and morning errands. Saw car in driveway, thought nothing of it... Tried to go in back door to avoid who might be inside since I hadn't done my makeup yet not had my morning cig and coffee... Back is locked. Go back to front door... Enter... Aaaaaaand ... Random dude in a suit in my living room, with my family, sitting in a circle 

They read from papers how much I'm hurting them and how much it hurts them to see me hurting. Etc. It went on for two hours.

I don't want to go to the program- being forced to do it today, though- so the intervention guy helps my parents think of horrible consequences for me if I refuse. Ultimately I agree.

So in three hours I'll be heading off on the 45 min ride to a detox to get off heroin, methadone and benzos.


Best case scenario, it actually somehow works. Though in my experience, being forced into treatment when you're not ready is kinda dumb

Worst case, I wasted my time there but am now off methadone for the first time in over 3 years so I can actually feel heroin and get high without a damn blocker only letting me feel 10-15% of the high. That's pretty sweet. 

^ that above might even be solid proof that I'm not ready to quit... Psyched to detox off the methadone so that my dope will bring me higher and last longer.. Fuck yeah 

Hid a few hundred bucks so I can cop right when I'm out... Just in case.

I thought I was gonna lose my job...  They've been having issues at work lately and this is literally last second, no 2 weeks notice... My boss was so surprisingly supportive and says I can come back in a few weeks and just jump right back into work as if I were never gone. I thought she'd fire me but she was amazing and so accommodating. I told her this was inpatient for mental health only since I've been suicidal and having frequent panic attacks... Which is true... But didn't mention the drugs.

If I'd known this dude would be waiting in my living room this morning, I'd have saved some dope from last night to do. Instead I took 4mgs of Ativan. Typing this is kinda hard and confusing since I'm crying and the Ativan isn't helping.

The intake people I spoke to won't let me pack shit. Ugh. This is gonna be a rough, tough detox. Cold turkey off methadone? Not looking forward to it. Who thinks interventions are a good idea? Forcing people who aren't ready to quit or don't wanna quit never seems to work. But this guy in my living room, this is his job and every day he helps families in the area surprise and gang up on an addict and force them into treatment... Or pay the consequences. Ugh. 

So, im not dead or in jail or anything like that... Im forced into detox and rehab, woohoo




EDIT************
Was rejected by detox anyways. So after all that bull. Telling my job a bunch of crazy shit. Etc. I was rejected due to being on methadone. Will elaborate later but come the FUCK on. This has been the day from hell. I need to get high so so badly right now I'm losing my mind

My tolerance has mostly increased over the last year or so, and is big enough that I need roughy 8-12mg subs to tide me over. Yet the other day I skipped my dose, and when the WDs from subs started I took just a couple grams of kratom, and it stopped the WDs DEAD in their tracks- I slept through the entire night and didn't even wake up in sweats (possibly the craziest part). I even still felt a slight mood boost- maybe a tiny bit of warmth.

Kratom effects are pretty mild, but they ALWAYS seem present, no matter how high my tolerance. It's also relatively easy to stop compared to pretty much any other opiate as long as you stick to plain leaf.

My question is.. what do doctors think about this? Has anyone asked about kratom with their sub doctor or methadone clinic? Is there anywhere in the world where kratom is prescribed for detox/tapering/maintenance? I think suboxone is a godsend, but if I could get the same effects with a couple tablespoons of kratom why would I ever want to go down that route, when subs are so incredibly potent and unpleasant to withdraw from? Not to mention how cheap kratom is.

I know the legal status of this is mostly going in the opposite direction, but I really hope it becomes an option for treatment some time in the future.",1463319834.0

My California opioid journey, particularly the final stage of active using in which I solely used heroin, did not ruin my life but in fact had quite the opposite effect.
After having an incredibly bad withdrawal experience, I made sure that I was always stocked up with extra since there was no way that I ever wanted to experience that pain ever again. Therefore, for the last couple months of active using the prospect of withdrawal was nonexistent. I feel that heroin helped me get my life together by stabilizing me. It helped me start participating and showing up for the responsibilities and people in my life. It helped me consistently attend lectures and classes at my university. It helped me get college papers and assignments complete, to an excellent standard.
The reason I chose to go on Suboxone maintenance (which I had planned out essentially from the begin of my addiction which started with hydrocodone) was because I'd reached the point where the only way I could get high was through using the IV route of administration. I am hopeless at finding a vein, and also, I feel like at this point in my life, particularly with the current safety issues caused by drug prohibition, I do not want to be physically and psychologically addicted to intravenous heroin use.
I want to be clear that I am in no way promoting heroin use, or the use of any opioid; I am merely sharing my personal experience with opioids and how they affected my life, especially as my journey is contrary to the classic model of addiction. Of course opioid addiction can (and usually does) ruin people’s lives as well as the lives of those around them. I am trying to show that the ruining of one’s life is not a necessary aspect of opioid addiction, unlike many other commonly used drugs, e.g. cocaine, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, ketamine, etc.",1463296742.0

As soon as I met that sweet lady H I was swept off my feet, it was some love at first sight shit for me honestly. I guess there has always been something a little off with me, if that makes sense? I mean, I can function at a social level but deep inside I guess there's always been this pitch black emptiness. Heroin filled that for me like nothing ever has. No lover/person, no other drug, no accomplishment has ever brought me the peace and joy that black tar heroin did.
I guess that's the point of it all, isn't it? We don't live this way for nothing.
Anyway, heroin wrecked my life. Eh, I would say it wrecked my life at wicked fast speeds. I was hooked, it became my family and my job and my entire existence. I knew I would probably die, but that's how much at peace I was with myself. Too at peace I suppose. So I went to rehab for a couple months. I grew up in a super twisted home so I chose a rehab that focused on trauma. I healed alot, I definitely did. Going to treatment changed me as a person, I can hold a job now and act like a decent person most of the time. 
But always every night this crazy shit happens to me. I lay down and my other half is asleep and the thoughts creep in. I feel like I'm cheating on him or something, because to me heroin was a lover and I'm fantasizing about that lover quite a bit alone at night. Kinda weird. I've planned and canceled and planned my relapse again and again. I will play this game for a bit I'm sure but the result seems inevitable. Doesn't matter because today I didn't get high... but I have noticed in the absence of my opiate queen I have become an alcoholic instead. I'm okay with this for now.
Anyways, I guess the point I wanted to make with all of this rambling is how nuts it is that heroin could still have such a dark, relentless hold on my soul even after a significant amount of time. I think about it all the time, I just wish I knew how to get her off my mind. 
How is it that a drug could fuck us up like this? So irrevocably?...

I haven't slept in 2 days and I had work tonight. So I got to work and I had one line left and it was pretty big so I decided to do it after I got dressed. I really don't remember much after that except going to have a sip of my drink and then all of a sudden needing to throw up so I ran in the bathroom. Next thing I know my big boss is there along with a cop and 2 EMTs, I was in absolute fucking panic mode. I thought the would/had gone through my stuff looking for whatever they could find. I am pretty sure I was conscious because if they gave me narcan I would be sick right now right?

. I literally have no idea what happened between those two times but apparently I was slamming phones around and not making any sense. 


So next thing I know I'm sitting in my  office by myself and then the cop comes in with my boss. He starts doing with his million questions, I'm sitting there on the verge of a panic attack bawling my eyes out because I was so embarrassed, even though I don't know though I don't know what I did bad enough for them to call 911. Back in the day, there were rumors about me had been spread about Adderall so I had told the owner of the company that I had a prescription to save my ass. My brilliant self tells them that I lost my health insurance so I stop taking it so it's making my head a little wishy-washy.


So now the EMTs are checking my pulse and stuff and telling me that I really really really should go to the hospital. Very funny because that's the last place I would go. 

So they all take some info from me trying to get me to go to the hospital again and I keep telling them no, so eventually they leave. This just now leaves me and my boss. He keeps asking me what I'm on and telling me I'm on something but I keep trying and telling him that it's just the two days of no sleeping. I'm pretty sure I cleaned up my mess when I was done, so hopefully there isn't any proof out there or I will be totally fucked. 


So now my boss is telling me that I'm not going to be able to finish my shift (what a tragedy) and that I can't drive home so I have to find a ride. I live 40 minutes away.

I've been taking it everyday, but only at 4mg, doc wanted me to slowly increase so actually started me on 2.4mg. But I'm not sure 4mg is enough. Is there anyway to know? Does anyone have experience of what its like to be on too low a bupe dose during replacement.

At the moment, a couple hours before the dose of the day, my anxiety goes up, I get stomach cramps, sweating. Nothing terribly major though. But at 4mg it does nothing at all for cravings which sucks, is bupe supposed to stop craving? Basically is it worth pushing the doc to increase my dose, and how should I go about that, just be perfectly straight with him?

My saliva seemed to do the trick.,"I normally don't post about drugs online anymore, but I unfortunately have spiraled a bit back into pills recently. I got a hold of an OC40 (oxycontin) a while back and tried to chew it. It had been a long time, and it was then that I discovered this new time release polyethylene glycol situation. 



I've been unfortunately abusing IR's for the last month.. about 30-45 mg a day (but just chewing and eating on an empty tummy), so I have a bit of a tolerance again. Today, instead, I got an OC40 again. I researched the crap out of this, but decided I didn't have it in me to go through a huge ordeal to defeat the time release. 



I'd read that people were having luck with breaking it down with their saliva, and also with acidic situations. So, I drank a glass of orange juice (doubt this helped as this is not what people meant by using soda or orange juice, but it couldn't hurt and is yummy), used a razor blade to cut the pill into tiny chunks, and have been simply rolling it around in my mouth for the last hour and a half. 



It has been VERY effective. I'm no chemist, but I know that I'm certainly feeling that 'slow onset rush' as I call it and I know that I'm feeling very much more than if I'd just swallowed it and that it is kicking in faster. I also know this is not a placebo effect; I spent a long time thinking hard about it and making sure of this before I posted.




I just wanted to throw this out there for you guys. I was wondering if just letting it break down in my mouth would break the time release at all, because it seemed too easy to be effective, and I had only read about it in about 3 posts out of the dozens I scrolled through. But, it seems that simple seeming solutions are easily ignored when they seem too good to be true. I've lost count of how many people have brushed off my repeated suggestion to try Imodium to help with WD's because they could not possibly believe that Imodium helped me fantastically since it was a simple over the counter medication. They refused to even try, even though it couldn't hurt, and even when I was offering them the Imodium for free. Imodium does me wonders, and I know everybody's biology is different, but the simple sounding solutions tend to bring out the stubbornness in people and this understandably very human and common in a lot of us in all aspects of life.




I'm much past the young dumb trait of wanting to talk about the drugs I've ingested just to talk about it, so this really is a post aimed at helping people stay away from dangerous solvents and such, and I'm using a throwaway just for this post. People are attempting to use dangerous chemicals to try to break these down so I'm really hoping to steer somebody away from that and into a safer direction (obligatory ""abusing drugs of any kind is not safe in itself"") and to remind us all that sometimes the solutions that sound too good to be true actually do work. But, this is my own personal experience and I know everybody's biology is different.




Also, just some side-pondering here- is polyethylene glycol even safe? Have they ironically added a very unhealthy ingredient? I don't know chemistry like I said, but it just seems unsafe and strange to use in a medication.. I'm almost wondering if they're making these pills more harmful by trying to make them unable to be abused.

I have been addicted to pills for over 8 years, it progressed from the usual 2 or 3 every day or so, stealing them from my wife and family members, I figured I can manage this, but I was mistaken addiction took over my life.

Addiction had a hold of my life, I was no longer in control of my life, while I thought I was, I was doing things just to get pills that can now end me in jail for a long time, on that note my future is still uncertain, I am out on bond awaiting charges, which is extremely scary, since I could lose the family I love, my children, my wife, mom and brother. All because of these stupid pills, I do not need you any more.

The pain that I endured in the 36 hours in jail was much worse than any withdrawal that I have experienced, yesterday I went through all my staches and [dumped them at the unused prescription bin](http://i.imgur.com/4EfIYtA.jpg) (No, I would not have given this to anyone, so don't comment about it), I did this to get rid of any memories that take me back to using, along with this I got rid of all my opiate related books and anything that glorifies drug usage.


It was a realization since I had to go through memories on what I did to get those pills, I counted 50 empty prescription bottles,  this is when it hit me what have I done with my life, almost flushed it down the toilet, why because I want to get high, it was because I was no longer in control, the dragon had taken over me.

A big shout out to Mom /u/traceyh415  for always being there no matter what and to /u/hello-titties for reaching out and please if you are in the Wasatch Front pick up a Narcan Kit from http://www.utahnaloxone.org/ whether you are using or not it is always safe to have, I'm sure there are others that I am missing, but I will be unsubscribing from /r/opiates since for me it is a trigger.

I have a plan to handle the WD, consists of nausea pills, lope, cold medicine and my standard depression medicine (diazepam, celexa) as well as I have an appointment with an addition specialist, this is so when I go to court it looks good, so that the charges that I have will not be as severe, but I still need an attorney which I cannot afford, I have set up a GoFund me, if you wish to help please message me and I will send you the link.

I also plan to go to Narcotics Anonymous, which it is scary since I may be doing this alone, I have my wife, I haven't talked to her about going, but I'm sure that she will come with.

Thank you /r/opiates for the advice on PST, WDs and the laughs we shared, thank you for all of you that have helped me in some way or another, but it is time to say.
