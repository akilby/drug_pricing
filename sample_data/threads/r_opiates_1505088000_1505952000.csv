I've got a huge habit.  If I don't binge at all I can keep it around $600-800/wk.  If binging (speedballs) it gets out of control

I've somehow up to this point held down a really good job for the last 8 or so years, but for a variety of reasons Ive become pretty depressed, unable to get out of bed, etc.  Working from home.  This past year has been really bad.

I see a psychiatrist who had me on meds and such, and was more or less truthful w/ him about my use (downplayed it quite a bit, he says I need to goto rehab but w/ my job I can't swing it.)

I've been off my meds for awhile which is obviously a big part of it, but I'm fearing that I'm going to lose my job -- or at least it's definitely heading in that direction. 

Anyways my question is: has anyone used their work insurance to goto rehab or similar?  Does having stuff like that on your insurance fuck you over for stuff in the future?

I've gone to methadone clinics in the past, but made sure to pay out of pocket.  Same deal when I've had an abscess or shit like that.

Methadone made me sweat like a pig and suboxone gives me terrible headaches, otherwise I'd be willing to go that route again.  Was thinking might try methadone again since winter is coming up, if only to get my tolerance down.

tl;dr anyone have experiences w/ rehab using their work insurance, particularly if you were some kind of professional w/ a career (as opposed to a job).  Outpatient vs inpatient, did it help, any affect on your job?",1505126079.0
6zeg6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/6zeg6p/clean_12_days_dont_really_wanna_go_back/,39,https://redd.it/6zeg6p,frothyflaps,Clean 12 days? Don't really wanna go back.,"So I've posted on here on and off from a multitude of different accounts I've since deleted. I think the last I'd posted before I made this account was how I had gotten through morphine w/d thinking it was just the flu, and that I was done for good. I see how well that worked though. 

Basically after like almost two months clean off opiates, in mid July? I had a full script of oxy 30's waved in my face for dirt fucking cheap, trying to get me back into the game again, and obviously I bit. 60 oxy 30's for next to nothing relative to how much I would have paid normally. Then after those disappeared I ended up back smoking dope daily, due to how astronomically cheap I was getting this super potent stuff that was hard, but would turn into tar with moisture (gunpowder?) from this newer connect I met.

Towards the end of this run of usage, a user who was on vacation in my area PM'd me asking for me to help him get a plug for clear and dope for however long he was here. Of course I helped a brother out, and he offered to buy me a g just for hooking him up with a guy, and I accepted, as he insisted that he help me out as well. I went through that 1.1ish, in under one full day, that scared the shit out of me, so I deleted my plugs contacts, and blocked the number.

After this I was on maybe day 2, maybe day 3 of withdrawal, just taking like 16mg immodium every 20-24 hours, so I could actually get up, and move around/sleep kinda. I felt pretty fantastic for someone in the middle of dopesickness, and was ready to take on all the lethargy post withdrawal. Yet of course a friend came over the following day, and lo and behold, he has a fucking treasure trove of poppy pods, stems, and actual opium. He had owed me money from me lending him a quite hefty amount of cash earlier this year (I knew he would make good of it) and since no one knew I was detoxing he left them with me. I'm sure all of the junkies on these forums know damn well how impossible that would be to turn down when you practically have a flu, with how bad your sickness is feeling.

I spent a week, going through all the tea, I made, and smoking all the opium he had left me. It was wonderful while it lasted, but alas, not worth it at all. The withdrawals came back, but worse, and not made better by the fact a two year relationship was ended during them, and I felt like absolute death, for maybe five days. Here I am now though day 12, or 13? Finally feeling happy again, my energy is coming back, and I feel the anhedonia ever so slightly receding, and I can feel the tiniest bit of pleasure from simple tasks, or distracting myself with Dark Souls. Maybe I'll relapse in the future, but as things are standing, it's really not worth it. Not worth the hours of my life spent to buy a substance for $50 that is gone in a day, not worth the depression, dread, and sickness of running out. Fuck me, I don't know how I've been doing this shit for as long as I have, even if the time frame is miniscule compared to some addicts I know. I've wasted damn near two years of my life being a slave to fucking pills, some powder, and a goddamn cartel. I'm out of the woods for now in terms of withdrawal, however I can feel the draw of opiates every minute of every day. I intend to try my best to stay clean though.

All of this might sound a little stupid for only eleven days, and it was probably very rambly, and written very awfully, but I just really needed to get that all off my chest. I have no one to talk to about this shit.

Forgive me if you feel this is not posted in the proper place. Or just stop reading, hit the back arrow, and go back to whatever you were doing.



I'm pretty much good to go as far as not banging drugs anymore. I've had lots of clean time, lots of relapses, and lots of failures to learn from. Believe me, or don't. It doesn't matter because at this point I feel like I'm only struggling hard with one last puzzle piece: balance. Which is why I'm here asking the following question.


It doesn't matter what it is. If I like something, I jump in head first and try not to drown. Something that should be healthy or normal doesn't usually seem to pan out that way with me. I seem to thrive in chaos, pressure, sickness, and torture. I am still somewhat self destructive, even if its not nearly as bad as shooting drugs.


If I read a book, one would probably think ""cool, good job, just don't use drugs."" But what if I don't put the book down? What if I ignore things like laundry, being to work on time, eating/sleeping properly, healing and creating relationships, taking the trash bin to the road so it doesn't pile up another week, or just general life responsibilities simply because I don't want to stop reading? What if I can hardly go 5 minutes without checking my phone? What if I drink coffee until I vomit and shit myself, but then drink more? What if I play guitar until my fingers turn to pulp only then to beat on it with my nubs? 


I can bring a book with me and keep reading as I drag the trash out. I'm not stupid. Those were just examples that were grossly exaggerated to provide an idea. The idea that I have trouble with regulation.


How do I learn to balance pleasure and responsibility? How do I motivate myself to stop mentally masturbating and be more responsible, even if it isn't destroying me nearly as fast as the needle was?


Does this make any sense to anyone else? 


PS- love you guys. I have pretty much just lurked for a long while now. But I swear on God's saggy tits that junkies are some of the most interesting people that I've met.

In case that link has problems type the following into the navigation bar. www.tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat


*disclaimer: the room linked above has nothing to do with this subreddit or its mod team. they do not have any hand in the operations thereof, and do not endorse it in any way shape or form. any opinions expressed by and any actions taken by the moderators and/or of this tinychat room are the responsibility solely of the tinychat moderators. be careful to whom you give out any personal information that you might not want to be known, and if you have any disagreement with a user or moderator in that room, it can and will be handled only on tinychat, as the tinychat room is utterly unaffiliated with this subreddit and its moderators.*

The reasons we are trying to form this as a nightly thing again are these, which were the original reasons for a group of this sort when it was formed years ago. Many of us, myself included, lost sight of the original purpose of the group (which again has nothing to do with this subreddit or its moderators) and allowed it to become a popularity war and a largely unmitigated hotbed of drama, which will not be permitted to happen again as we've all seen what the end result of that is. This is not an official room for anything or any group of people---it is open to any and everyone. The only rules are:   
1. no hate speech including but not limited to racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and any sort of personal attacks.  
 2.nothing that could be construed as sexual harassment, no nudity (as per the terms of service of the chat host, tinychat), no distribution of illegal digital materials or solicitation or provision of any goods or services likewise prohibited by tinychat, the federal government, and your state/province or should such be the case, country's government, interpol, and any other relevant organizations that may have legal jurisdiction.   
3. No harassment of other members either digital or ""analog"" so to speak. If you are found to be harassing, stalking, or otherwise distressing another chatter, you will be spoken to by the moderators of the chatroom (not of this or any other subreddit unless one is explicitly formed to deal with the concerns of the chatroom which at this time has NOT been done) to determine whether such behavior can be stopped voluntarily without further action being taken, that being a ban from the community of our (unaffiliated with this subreddit) chatroom. 



The first primary mission is harm reduction. If you're partying alone, don't. The ultimate price is usually collected upon when playing alone. The moderators of this chat will always come hang out with anyone should they need another person around for any sort of reason whatsoever. Additionally, if you have any questions about something pertaining to harm reduction, the moderators of the chat are educated in harm reduction issues and disease prevention, and /u/everything_is_still has training in first aid. 

The other no less important mission of the room is to provide companionship to those in need. This life can be lonely. We seek to provide a place where one might find friends to discuss ones interests with openly in a way that may not be available in day to day life, talk about music or video games or anything else you like with others in a welcoming and comfortable (since you're sitting in your own home/squat/whatever your flavor, most likely) space where you can be certain you won't be judged for those things that are so heavily stigmatized by mainstream society.  

Expository language aside, we are here to have fun. So definitely do that. ;)

I know this all sounds serious, but I wanted to remind everyone why we are here and what we will be providing. Please feel free to join. /u/everything_is_still will be online every night at least by 11:30pm, sometimes earlier unless otherwise mentioned. Other moderator schedules to be announced here. And do recall once again that this chat has nothing to do with this subreddit, has different rules, and that disputes may be handled in a different matter than they are on this subreddit and that the moderators of this subreddit have no interest in what happens in the chatroom and do not want to be bothered with it any more than they would want to hear about the lady who cut you off in the checkout line in the supermarket, which has the same degree of relevance. Thanks to the mods of this subreddit, however, for allowing us to promote our community here. [Thanks and hope to see you in tinychat](http://www.tinychat.com/ropiatesubchat).

edit: if you are not interested in the room or in these posts, please be respectful and do not downvote them because of personal feelings about the poster or anything else. if you have an issue that requires addressing, please pm one of the moderators and they will be glad to assist you.

The other guy I was going to recently is SO nice, always asks about my daughter, doesn't make me wait, has helped me out and just overall is a cool guy. My other one tho, complete fucking asshole.

The first day he was back around after the brief period of selling just white cut that was complete shit, he was acting all nice and friendly and was immediately pulling up as I was. Fast forward and now he's gone total douche. Like today, for example, went to hang with family a little for my birthday. His phone went off yesterday, an hour after he told me to call him when on way (I live 10 away from the spots). It came back on today as I was heading the 30 mins away to fam. Again, he told me call when omw. I stayed a couple of hours and then made the call that I was heading down to him. He said to call when I'm ""on certain road that's close) and because of yesterday, I had to ask, ""you'll definitely be around in 30 minutes?""

""Yo I can't tell the future *my name* just call me when your close."" You can't tell the future? What the fuck. How about you tell me if you're going to ditch when I'm about to pull up? Or that I should rush, or literally anything other than that when I'm saying I'm on my way.

He did serve me but seriously what the fuck. I'm so sick or bein treated line scum or a fucking savage by him, I've been nothing but good business for 4 years; and for someone to claim loyalty is everything then you shit down my throat when I'm trying to continue to give him money.

I always try to cop on my lunch break at work, which is a brief couple hour window of when I'm even allowed to take it. I'll call around 11 am, already gritting my teeth through the morning because I've been too broke to afford to stay well past a single day at a time. He'll say he's getting dressed, and that'll take another 2 hours (I can only guess he's either a super hero fighting crime, fucking with me, or sleeps all afternoon), then he'll finally tell me to come on down and I'll jump out like it's my turn on the Price is Right.. only to wait at the spot for at least 30 more minutes. Which makes me late, every fucking time. I'm so sick of his shit and I know I seriously already need to quit for good but it's pushing me to the point of telling him every little thing that I'm mad about and never calling again. I'm a nice person to him and have no idea why out of nowhere he started acting like this.. since the beginning of the year.",1505084198.0

Anyways, I want to hear some funny opiate (or any drug) stories to cheer me up.

I'll start:

I had just left one of my guys house from getting Roxy 5s, just recently got off dope so my tolerance was low, but now low enough. I ate 14 of them and then crushed up 4 more to snort as I'm driving home. It's a ton of powder so I pull off into this apartment complex to actually snort them.

I pull in, park, give my surroundings a quick peak and go to work cutting out lines. I had only been looking down for a few seconds when I hear a noise, look up and see a lady about to open my door and I panic. I'm fucked. I have a ton of pills on me, and just because they are only 5s doesn't mean shit to the cops. I'm ready for this lady to start yelling and screaming at me for getting high in front of her house, call the cops, etc., but that's not what happened.

She opened my drivers side door, turned around and sat on my lap (sending the powder everywhere). This all happened in a split second so I didn't have time to react until she was actually on my lap. The second she touched my lap she turns and looks at me, screams and jumps out of the car yelling "" oh my god I'm so sorry, I thought this was my car, omg I'm so sorry"" etc.

That's right. I was sitting there in the parking lot at night with my lights on and my engine running and this bitch was so wasted she just hopped in to the first white car she saw (hers was two cars down). 

I was so freaked out I didn't say a word and just bailed as soon as she was out of my car, but the craziness of what just happened registered about 5 minutes later as she shock wore off. 


Anyways, let me hear some funny shit! ",1505064916.0

The fact that the maid left it doesn't mean she did a poor job cleaning, it means she's a good person and doesn't take people's stashes when they leave the room! I'd stay at this place in a heartbeat if they left drugs in your room when you check in and the maids can be trusted with your stash!

Then they go on to complain because they weren't made to feel special for being pissy about finding drugs.. I just don't get some people. Dude - you're in a public place! It's not the fault of the hotel, it's the whacked out idiots who stayed there before you! 

Also, why the hell are you offended that you were asked if they were your drugs? Was it accompanied by a wink and a nod towards the back office? 


So.. there are MANY more reviews of other hotels with this ""complaint"".  I'm clearly staying in the wrong places! 
Does anyone else find some of the negative reviews on places absolutely fascinating? I rarely have a reason to complain, but it seems some people literally elevate bitching about fuck all to an artform.

I went to rehab about four or five months ago because of an attempted suicide and my family found out about my drug use. Ever since my family found out they no longer give me money in exchange for working for them or getting good grades(started off at $200 an A, $150 a B and $50 a C), and they were my only source of income I've never had a job (I've been applying everywhere since I got out of rehab no one has responded) and I dropped out of school. Currently I have to steal/sell my family's stuff to get a quick buck and get high about 3-4 days out of the week. But that's not enough and I still get sick and spend most of my time off H thinking about ways and means to get more H. Should I try a lot harder and wait longer to get a real job? or should I start dealing? I am a little shorter and skinnier than most guys my age which is why I've never dealt before, in fear of being an easy target to mug.

I've finally been given my script for bupreopmorphine after years of battling heroin addiction, 2 years really.

I asked the doctor about being thrown into withdrawls if I dose too early, but he took his quite lightly.

he said generally Heroin has a half life of around 9 hours , and that after that I'm good to dose - he also said make sure that I can feel withdrawl symptoms before dosing, that's a good iNdicafion fhat im dose.

this time I had been tapering with dihydrocodeine after running out of Heroin, and my last dose was 7am - I was at the doctors by 9:30 and he said that because the DHC half life is 4 hours , so he sakd air til lunch time (12pm) before dosing.

then outside was junkie who was on subs telling me to wait as long as possibly could before dosing.

can anyone help me out with thee queries?

** is 6mg a decent dose to stop cold turkey kicking my ass? I can ask for it to be increased if I don't feel
better. **

I'd personally hate to be on anythjng over 16mg because jve heard sub withdrawal from a high dose just mirrors heroin detox so I want my dose low as poss while still working.

**is subutex a strong opiate? because a drug that is dose once a day that apparently works this well makes me a bit apprehensive, not even oxy would work this well, I'd have to redose even after taking 40mg oral.**

how would this drug feel to a non user with zero tolerance, would they veg high like they were on codeine or something?

it sounds like it has absolutely no recreational value while occupying the opiate receptors, and that's how the blocking aspect works. 

however, j have heard of junkies who have injected subutex, and nobody IVs a drug if it doesn't have recreational value.",1505212865.0

The question I posted is obviously is not a type of question you can find an answer to on a medical website. The quickest way to find out a legitimate answer to this type of question is through the website or application we call Reddit. instead of wasting my time on countless other other forums where you often never recieve a response to your post and oftentimes when you do get a response, it is full of negative, condescending, belittling, and just purely immature responses. After years of looking online, I have come to the conclusion that Reddit is hands down the best overall place form to inquire, assist, and just communicate about whatever it is that you feel the news to communicate. Majority of topics have their own subreddits and no matter what time of day it is, you are almost always able to get a fairly quick response to your post just depending on how many active redditors are in that subreddit.

To me the worst by product of opiate dependence is how much it impacts my normal bodily process. Shitting, pissing, eating, sex and sleeping normally have become impossible for me. Perhaps it's more predominant for me than for other but I can't remember the last time pissing took less than 25 minutes and didn't lead to me being sweaty and nearly herniated. The best solution I've found is leaning forward at like 45 degrees. I don't know why but it makes it easier. Shitting is even worse but I'll spare yall the details.

Sometimes, I just feel it in my torso but other times my whole body will jolt so hard my arms will even fly up in the air a little. Other times I can just feel it in my legs. 

It's starting to worry me a little because it's happening more and more often. The only way I can explain it is, I've seen people with Tourettes suffer from a hard tick. That's what my tremor looks like. They started a little more than a week ago. I had them once every few days at first. Now, I have 4 - 5 ""tremors"" every time I get high.

My brother passed away a few months ago from a heroin/cocaine overdose.  After his death I started to struggle with alcohol and it was starting to ruin my life.  I tried to cold turkey it but that didn't work for me so I did some research.  I learned of a drug called Naltrexone that could potentially reduce my desire to drink.  Basically I take a 50mg tablet an hour before I drink and my drinking problem completely disappeared with my first dose.  I still take the pill an hour before I drink every time I drink tho.

Fast forward to me talking to a friend of mine who is a doctor.  He was telling me that Naltrexone is also used as an implant under the skin for heroin addicts.  They can continue to use if they choose but it reduces the desire to use.  He also told me it has close to 100% cure rate in the clinical trials.

The reasons we are trying to form this as a nightly thing again are these, which were the original reasons for a group of this sort when it was formed years ago. Many of us, myself included, lost sight of the original purpose of the group (which again has nothing to do with this subreddit or its moderators) and allowed it to become a popularity war and a largely unmitigated hotbed of drama, which will not be permitted to happen again as we've all seen what the end result of that is. This is not an official room for anything or any group of people---it is open to any and everyone. The only rules are:
1. no hate speech including but not limited to racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, and any sort of personal attacks.
2.nothing that could be construed as sexual harassment, no nudity (as per the terms of service of the chat host, tinychat), no distribution of illegal digital materials or solicitation or provision of any goods or services likewise prohibited by tinychat, the federal government, and your state/province or should such be the case, country's government, interpol, and any other relevant organizations that may have legal jurisdiction.
3. No harassment of other members either digital or ""analog"" so to speak. If you are found to be harassing, stalking, or otherwise distressing another chatter, you will be spoken to by the moderators of the chatroom (not of this or any other subreddit unless one is explicitly formed to deal with the concerns of the chatroom which at this time has NOT been done) to determine whether such behavior can be stopped voluntarily without further action being taken, that being a ban from the community of our (unaffiliated with this subreddit) chatroom.

The first primary mission is harm reduction. If you're partying alone, don't. The ultimate price is usually collected upon when playing alone. The moderators of this chat will always come hang out with anyone should they need another person around for any sort of reason whatsoever. Additionally, if you have any questions about something pertaining to harm reduction, the moderators of the chat are educated in harm reduction issues and disease prevention, and /u/everything_is_still

has training in first aid.

The other no less important mission of the room is to provide companionship to those in need. This life can be lonely. We seek to provide a place where one might find friends to discuss ones interests with openly in a way that may not be available in day to day life, talk about music or video games or anything else you like with others in a welcoming and comfortable (since you're sitting in your own home/squat/whatever your flavor, most likely) space where you can be certain you won't be judged for those things that are so heavily stigmatized by mainstream society.

Expository language aside, we are here to have fun. So definitely do that. ;)

I know this all sounds serious, but I wanted to remind everyone why we are here and what we will be providing. Please feel free to join. /u/everything_is_still
will be online every night at least by 11:30pm, sometimes earlier unless otherwise mentioned. Other moderator schedules to be announced here. And do recall once again that this chat has nothing to do with this subreddit, has different rules, and that disputes may be handled in a different matter than they are on this subreddit and that the moderators of this subreddit have no interest in what happens in the chatroom and do not want to be bothered with it any more than they would want to hear about the lady who cut you off in the checkout line in the supermarket, which has the same degree of relevance. Thanks to the mods of this subreddit, however, for allowing us to promote our community here. Thanks and hope to see you in tinychat

So question.... My friend has recently been using meth to keep himself awake while smoking BTH. He truthfully doesn't even enjoy meth, and gives him absolutely zero euphoria, but prevents him for constantly nodding off and just being lazy af. Sometimes the even after taking meth and bth one I'm after another he still gets some anxiety. Nothing to crazy, but enough to make him uncomfortable. So he will sometimes pop a Valium or two into the mix. Not a high dosage, maybe only 10 - 20mg.of Valium. My friend is a daily user of smoking BTH daily and has been using benzos off and on and off for years and has a rather high tolerance. He used to meth regularly for years, but only started using it daily again about a month ago. Can using these three occasionally maybe in combination maybe once or twice a week put him in any serious danger that he should really be concerned about? Or as long as he keeps his dosage to a minimum, should he be alright? If he was taking 4+ Valiums or 2mg bars, etc, that would be a whole other story... All thoughts and opinions are appreciated thank you! Also any other reoxmkedjsrion to help with he anxiety he gets besides taking benzos or any other recommendations what to do to besides meth to stop nodding and being so lazy? TIA! ",1505180080.0

I told him I'd brb was just gonna get a drink and use the ladies room. I ended up staying in the same bathroom stall until the bar closed (4 hours I think,) and didn't come out until 3 bouncers opened the door and found me basically I'm a puddle of my own blood. Blood everywhere. The walls, the toilet, the floor, my hands. They kept screaming at me in shock. Drenched in sweat. I calmly said ""would you please walk outside the bathroom for 2 minutes while
I wash my hands so I can preserve the smallest amount of dignity i have left?"" They said no. So o washed my hands and began to tell them how doing it in a public space makes me a lot less likely to die from OD. Then I told them it's an illness and to stop laughing because what to them was a minor inconvenience  (because they closed 10 minutes ago) was to me the most humiliating thing I've ever been through. I just *had* to hit that vein. 

oh yeah remember that old friend? I made up the most hyperbolic ridiculous lie I  could think of. I told him I went to score weed with these people I'd met outside the bar while I  was smoking and that they essentially took me super far away and wouldn't let me leave their apartment. He believed me because his other choice was to believe I was crazy and I clearly wasn't. I'm also a great liar because I'm an addict. It's all good we're still friends. Also if you're reading this now buddy...oh wait mutually assured destruction I LOVE THIS SUB. 

I'm never going back to that bar. I am bright red just thinking about this. Please tell me it's ok. Tell me I'm not a terrible excuse for a human. And also  Tell me your story. ",1505177552.0

Is it possible to try without it fucking up your life / constantly thinking about it?,"I haven't tried any opiates, and my life is pretty good. I have a loving mother and girlfriend, friends and a pretty nice upper-middle class life. Currently studying at university.

I do amphetamines and benzos maybe weekly or bi-weekly, and have done that for a year with few issues. If I go without it, and have nothing to do, then sure, I'll think about how great it would be if I had some. But as long as I'm occupied and have something to do that keeps me motivated, I could go several weeks without doing any drugs and barely think about it at all.

So there's some backstory. I know the general piece of advice is just to never touch opiates, but I've been thinking about it. My life is pretty good, so I wouldn't be using them to ""escape"". Everything else I do is just for fun. I've never suffered withdrawals from anything. Mostly because when I've been very intoxicated on something, I dont feel like doing more the next few days at least.

Think I'm done with this shit.,"Just got off work and have been straight all week, so I wanted to score for the weekend. Called my guy up and he tells me to dial his new number. I write it down, call it, and this normie answers the phone so I'm like WTF? I ring the old number back and tell him what happened and he just flips his shit! Says ""If you can't even call the right number than just fuck off."" and hangs up... I text him back saying I'm sorry and it was just one digit off, and then he start pretending like he doesn't know me and shit. I tell him straight up ""Should I not call anymore then?"", and he's just like ""yup"". Now, I got no decent plug except a bunch of middle-men who rip me off really bad, so at this point I think this is it for me. Sick of chipping because my body is so opiate tolerant (on treatment) that even a few days of using makes me moderately WD. This whole thing is fucked and I shouldn't even be messing around since I'm on treatment and have responded really well with it. Sooo I think I'm seriously done with this game, but just wanted to shit post and get this off my chest.  
P.S. Don't take good plugs for granted, I just got paid and have a bunch of money but no hookup. Usually it's the other way around for people, but I always find myself in this predicament. Maybe it's fate trying to tell me I'm not cut out for this shit. Peace out. ",1505316481.0

""Picked up some fentanyl one day, accidentally. I don't go out to get Fent, I go for boy. Well, we get home and my boyfriend is already fucking wasted. He IVS - I DONT. 
I snort a decent size line and can feel it real good. I remember he was sleeping at this point, and I for some reason thought busting out a fat line would be a good idea. 

I snorted that shit up, and then.......and then I think it was 45 minutes later I faintly hear my love yelling my name, and then again but louder, and one last time, loudly. 
I look up at him and say WHATWHAT??.....I felt as if I woke up, but as I was frantically asking him what? I realised that I was not laying, I was crouched down, and butt ass naked. My bfs claims to have watched me sit, crouched - butt ass naked in the corner of the room and talking/mumbling to my self. 

Um what? 
I don't just do things like that. 
That just doesn't happen.
But it did. And I want to know why?
Because I've never seen anyone else have a blackout episode like that or even similar in creepiness. So what gives. Am I just a fucking closet psychopath? What the fuck?""

It would warn about the increased potency in recent cases. Advising the poster to start with far less than before quitting. Not to be alone, etc...

It would announce that it is a bot unless forbidden to do so by terms of the site. stating that it was written by people who have seen, or experienced loss of loved ones due to the common causes of death mentioned.

Arrived 15-20 minutes later.

&nbsp;

Upon arrival, we discuss future meeting times and concerns are expressed about this person's punctuality.

The dude get's mad offended which I expected. He goes on to say, ""my granma taught me that you gotta be on time, if you gotta be somewhere at 4, you're there and ready at 3:55.""

Dude literally describes what a punctual person does as though he practices what he preaches. He was late before, but he claimed the icrecream man sabotaged his milk shake to give him the shits. Kept going on about it too. Of course my friend and I didn't try to argue, just nodded in agreement.

&nbsp;

I'm already prepared to adapt but I do look forward to the next meeting to see if he's on time or if it's shenanigans. This dude isn't really trying to pull shit, I honestly think his perception of time is skewed in such a way that he doesn't realize he sucks at being on time. 

&nbsp;

**UPDATE**

I had to meet this dude a second time in the early AM after going to the ATM. The desired plan was to have me go t his house at a precise time but he didn't want to do that because it would look suspicious at 4AM. The plan put forth by the new dboy was to have him come to my friend's house at particular time. Last night (four hours earlier) he swore that he'd be on time. When I expressed concern about him being on time he got mad offended and shit. So anyway, fast forward to 4:10 AM, he's texting that he's leaving in five minutes tops. At one point 20 minuets later he says ""I left my house two minutes ago, I'll be there in three minutes"" and then after repeating two mintue etas he finally calls me. ""I need a favor"", said the dboy. ""I'm already doing a favor waiting"", I exclaimed. So he alaborates, ""it would save a lot of time if you could just come around the block now."" My friend hears this while I'm the phone and is like, ""wtf, for teh love of god?!"" The dboy goes, ""is clifford complaining?"" 

Like Deniro to Billy Bats, ""well you did specifically say you wanted to come meet us and then nearly an hour later you're asking to do things the way we wanted to do them in the first place to avoid waiting."" Anyway, I get to the dboy and after waiting two minutes outside he comes out to smoke a cig and make the swap. At this point he doesn't want me rushing out because it would look suspicious, but I'm like ""dude I have work in three hours, I wanted to be sleeping by now."" My friend is calling and texting and dboy is like, ""why can't he calm down."" I'm permitted to explain my friend's point of view, although the dboy doesn't want to acknowledge any fault for the extra time consumed.

Dboy goes on to explain that he had to go pick up from a stash spot, but like.. he swore he'd be at my friend's house at 4:10. Like literally said, ""this is my biz-niss. I'm always on time for biz-niss because it's about that bread bruh."" If he had to make an extra stop, it stands to be reasoned that he should've gone there 20 minutes earlier to make it for the scheduled arrival. 

&nbsp;

Anyway we are still grateful for the quality. It sure beats the time we received fake dope that smelled like pepper and coffee. The dude was honest about what he got us. My friend pretended that he had someone else available to deliver for the same competitive price which heaped to keep this guy as close to on time as he was.

I remember the ‚ÄúJust So No Campaign‚Äù

We wore costumes, were told fables-
‚ÄúKids if they‚Äôve got poppers keep your hands off of the table!‚Äù

to never drink the spiked Kool-Aid, never toss about a pharmacist‚Äôs deadly hand grenade

Too bad, the shine evolved to sweaty, glassy skin (that the devil told me was beautiful)
as I tied the tourniquet again, bruising my once supple island skin.

The late love of my life once stressed to me the true meaning of the word promise-
that it is binding, irrevocable, finite, and thrown around too easily.

She tied her red hair behind her head, looked at me and fiercely said,
‚ÄúWhen you make a promise, you sign an intangible contract, and like all contracts, should you break your promises, there are consequences (and chaos) that will ensue.‚Äù

I broke many promises to her, to all of you, and I‚Äôm sorry about that. 
She broke one too, but that‚Äôs over now, finite, Goodnight Babygirl, irrevocable, just like you said.

While her case is closed, I am drowning in clauses-
fallout of the many, many contracts I have deemed void amidst my tangled trapeze act.
Swing once, the Earth, dry herbs can‚Äôt hurt
Swing twice solidified chemicals (legally fed to the disturbed)
Swing a third or a fourth time and my grip slips, palms are turning red‚Ä¶
‚ÄúNever again little friend they all said-‚Äú  oh how I loved the thrill, but even fools knew
silly amateurs lacked the skill to distinguish Lion Tamers
from the animals themselves.

Please excuse my switch in metaphor, legal talk to circus chalk,
Elephants and peanuts, sticky candy, popcorn.
Spectators galore gathered ‚Äòround my adolescence 
to watch the shooting star turn into a crackwhore-

‚ÄúYOU WERE MEANT FOR SOMETHING MORE-‚Äú
‚ÄúWE FOUND YOU PASSED OUT ON THE FLOOR‚Ä¶.
‚ÄúWHEN THE POLICE BROKE DOWN THE DOOR,
THE REDS AND BLUES WERE NOTHING LIKE THE CIRCUS.‚Äù

Staying at gf house wake up from a nice state roughly 7am. Within an hour I can feel it build. This time it didn't stop at mild. Immediately wake up gf. She states I was yelling at shadows to go away. Do not recall that. At this point, my mind is collapsing. being buried alive. Knowing I will die. That i will never escape. The mind is naturally hopeful I believe, but as soon as these thoughts begin I remember where I am and i know I will be locked away until my last breath. Probably in an asylum. She drives me an hour to my folks house. My head is out the car window like a dog for the trip. Upon arrival symptoms subside slowly. Folks find out I've lapsed back into addiction. On and off usage of a homemade beverage. 2-3 times happening again but far less severe. Only thing that ever seemed to work in the moment was taking a walk.

therefore plugging would not technically increase the feeling of dihydrocodeine, but it may allow more to be converted into dihydromorphine with rectal bioavailability being higher


Thats the way that i understand it



**TL;DR** What are your experiences with Oral vs Rectal Dihydrocodeine? I have a lotof this stuff that i have saved over the years . I also have codeine. I don't plan on doing any -now- but down the line maybe i would boof some DHC if it is -really- better?",1505281521.0

It's either that or won't burn at all. Do y'all think maybe I'm not using big enough pieces? I broke .2 in half and put it on there. Or is it just very cut dope causing this?

It was around the end of August, I wondered why I hadn't heard from Matt in a while, went to his fb and there were the RIP posts. He died of a carfentanil-cocaine overdose. He was 23, and a beautiful human being. I miss him a lot. http://edmontonjournal.com/news/politics/david-staples-family-opens-up-about-sons-opioid-overdose-death-in-effort-to-spur-more-action

I met Matt at the ARC (detox), he was the sickest one in our dorm. He barely even moved for days, he just laid on his bed and occasionally came to eat. After 3 days, he began to spring to life, and the young man I had such a great honor and pleasure of meeting was Matt W. We talked of music and future dreams and goals, how we were gonna collaborate once he had completed his program at Shunda Creek. 

I remember beatboxing for him while he spit some of his old written stuff, it was fire. The last thing he said to me before I left ARC was ""just make sure you stay clean"". I didn't, and the very day I went back into detox for the last time, was the the day he died. Fuck I miss you so much buddy. I'll write some for you. 
xOoX

March 28 2017 was also the last day I saw Darcy alive.

Two or three days after I found out about Matt, I was talking to another friend of mine who's currently in the hospital and he told me Darcy was dead.
Darcy was so incredibly sweet, so generous even when we had just met. He disappeared after doing a huge shot this one day when it was snowing like fuck and his gf and I were just there like where tf did he go? lol. She was like ""I hope he's not face down in a snow pile"" so her and I lace up our kicks and head out into the snow storm. 

We go all the way to where he should have been and back without seeing him. At this point we're really like wtf, so his gf gets their car and by the time she pulls it up to the front of the apartment building to pick me up, guess who appears, with a pizza. LOL. We were just tripping tf out and he's like, y'all want pizza? lol, fuck I miss that. He also had a temper and had no problem saying fuck you go fuck yourself, and I love him for that too. A little googling and sure enough, there he was, on a page for obituaries..

I was pretty depressed for a little bit after that and I'm sort of still processing it but, it's getting easier.

Matt W - March 28 2017

I've been clean for technically (let me be BPG <_<) two weeks. I slipped for one bag last Monday. Anyways, due to this bitch ass storm I had to evacuate with family...and since then I have been meticulously planning my relapse or ""slip"". 

I did what I did to save my self and my mind.  I left my keys at my sisters place hours away and since the area I live in was hit by the storm I won't be getting those keys anytime soon. My whole family thinks I did it because I always ""do"" ditzy/stupid shit. This was completely on purpose. I had to sabotage myself. I know I was going to cop. I had to break the cycle.  I can't feel anything and I don't care about anyone/anything as clearly stated by the guy I'm currently seeing. 

The only time I felt anything besides complete emptiness was today while charging my phone in the car. I cried so hard and cursed myself for becoming addicted. I always had control in my life and I was very keen on keeping things organized and handling things on time. I've let heroin ruin this. I had to do this stupid act just so I could at least feel like I'm in control of things. 

On a side note(for those who are clean & sober): When did you start to feel again after coming clean off opiates? 

I unfortunately was never too emotional before opiates but opiates made me FEEL something for once. They made me feel like I can actually be a person for once.  Now it's back to them Jim Carey feels lol. 

Anyways hope y'all are safe and sound and have power because I'm using the last of my rationed battery life for today to type this out. Never taking power for granted again.

With every dollar I earned I stopped it on the dopeman or something else related. Few shoplifting tickets and missing their dates later I had a warrant. Started banging daily,hardly showering, smoking fucking LOTS of meth, and living with a gay old meth addict(he said I could tell his story as well,it's fucking nanners,lads).

No withdrawals, no sleepless nights, minimal to no PAWS. 

My life sucked on heroin, but the suffering was more bearable and I actually woke up everyday with excitement knowing I could lean on my BTH crutches. Ever since getting clean I've been doing all the right things; went to college, ate extremely healthy, exercised daily, meditated and engaged in other self-improving modalities.

To this day though, 4 years (almost) later and I still can't shake the fact that I am missing a part of me. Like a severed limb with phantom pains. I don't miss heroin because of heroin itself and all the highest highs it can bring, I miss heroin because it gave me a reason to live in the midst of my insufferable existence. 


This time I'm ready to do it right. I'm taking the time to order thousands of dollars worth of supplements and pharmaceuticals to keep my tolerance at a manageable level. One of them being ibogaine TA/hydrochloride.


I can't contain my excitement. I am sick of feeling guilty; I'm sick of staying clean because it makes others happy while I suffer greatly. Nobody understands how much I *don't* value my life. Sick of wearing a mask day in and day out trying to act like life is palatable without heroin.

So, love her to death and needing to appease her, I dropped everything; Minus some withdrawal meds.... vyvanse, etizolam, clonozolam and under .5 mg suboxone a day. At this point, I can get by without any sub at all with only slight discomfort. I get the shot Friday morning; been on it before, no biggie. 
BUT I  want to do dope once more but I can't do any until Thursday morning. Think I'll be hurting bad if I go through with injection the next day?

I need press experts to check these out. I'm unsure of these but they allegedly came from a script. Everything about them is flawless. No red flags visually or with taste etc. The red flags that concern me are: Orally they no effect. If snorted they will put you on your ass. Sometimes you can snort 2 or 3 and get very zooted. Sometimes you'll snort 1 and completely pass out with no euphoria.

 Has zero legs. Very intense high, more chatty and happy than euphoric. Here's the worst part: insane bad bad withdrawal within hours of last dose. A fellow user swears they're a fent anologue. The dealer who is a good guy swears they're a legit script. Dealer may not know because he only eats perc 10's. You can't even find a picture on the web of a press that even comes close to resembling these as far as quality goes. I'm very experienced with all types of 30's and these are just different. Again the withdrawal is epic and feels life threatening. 

What do ya'll think? Are pharm fresh M's like this compared to A's and K's?

I've read about people on suboxone hitting PWD even after waiting 40 hours and sppl on subutex only waiting 12 hours and being absolutely fine.

**Im personally on subutex and my doctor brushed so lightly over the time waited -- my last dose was at 7;30am and jf was dihydrocodeine, and he said in fine to dose at 12-1pm.**

I'm extremely confused by my well educated doctors advice, and what i read online - people online seriously talk about it so seriously and beg people to wait like 36 hours in intense withdrawal.

It started out like a normal morning, I wake up at 7:15am and grab some coffee as one of my roommates always gets up at 6am. We have a bad habit of doing all of our black the night before, which leaves us with nothing for the morning. After my coffee and morning Newport, I started to check my phones text messages to see if anyone of the people I middle for need any black. As of 11am I have two people that need a total of 2.5grams. I made a gram of black for myself but not any money. Then at 2pm, another two guys hit me up and want 4 grams of black and half of coca. I made $120 off this after one guy tipped me $40 for my help. My plug throws me a half and a dub for free as I'm bringing him money. Meanwhile, two guys have been texting me wanting a hookup but can't make it to town until 7:45pm. Normally, that would be too late as my guy closes at 8pm but my plug agreed to deliver to me. It's a 25 minute drive for him to deliver. This last order is for 9 grams, 7 to one guy and 2 to another. I made $160 off this plus a gram and the plug gave me another half for my business. 

When I woke up Wednesday morning, I had $0.00 in my wallet and no black. By the end of the day, I have $240 in my wallet and a ball of black! Today was a good come up. I didn't have to lie, cheat, steal, or rip anyone off in the process, which I won't do in the first place. So I'm sitting here at 5am smoking a tray of some fine BTH.

He shared his passions, his fucking wants with life, his love for his wife and son. I was rooting for him. He struggled in the past. But now he's at a homeless shelter and gave it all up. I get it, us addicts do dumb shit. But I can't take the way I feel. The drugs kept me so numb to the pain. This is fucking me up. I wanna beat his ass, I wanna make sure he's okay, I wanna be there for him while he has no one at this shelter 100's of miles from home.  I don't like these fucking real emotions I'm feeling but I know it's bound to happen again in the future. I guess this is a fact of the world we live in. Some of our friends go back to addiction. Some just die and leave completely. But it was so much easier dealing with this with drugs. I just hope that fucker is okay. Damnit.

Being able to laugh about it and not take it seriously for a second to help take your mind off it can help sometimes but none of these things are anything you should be proud of.)

If you were in a situation where you were applying for a job as a professional junkie, what would you put on your personal resume? I'm talking about all the stereotypical junkie lifestyle things that we're supposed to be ashamed of like number of times arrested, amount of money spent on your addiction, relationships ruined because your addiction, number of times overdosed, skills gained that help you be a better junkie, length of time spent homeless, number of years experience being an addict, etc. I call em anti-achievements. 

For me it would be 5 year heroin addict, smoker

I been to jail once because of my addiction, 10 days for paraphernalia/theft 3 aka shoplifting

I lost my fiance of 3 and a half years and future mother to my kids because we were both addicts and she moved away to get clean and stayed there

I wasted a $20,000 college fund that was set up for me when I was born in under 6 months, spending probably close to if not over a total of $100,000 total in my 5 years of addiction so far

I got evicted from my first apartment with my name on it half way into the lease because I spent all my savings

I lost my future very very nice career with the military just a few days before I was supposed to sign the paperwork to officially join because the d.a. didn't prosecute my case until a year later after it happened and so I didn't even know I was supposed to be at court in a week until my recruiter told me as he was doing my final background check and told me I could no longer join because of the drug charge

I've never been on the streets homeless but I spent 6 months living and small time dealing out of my car

I got good at manipulating people out of necessity to keep up my habit when I couldn't get money myself.

Me and my ex developed a little bonney and clyde situation running around our town and the surrounding towns doing return scams from all the different stores before they all found out what was happening to them and changed their return policies. Anyone that did return scams a few years ago knows what I'm talking about, opportunity for huge profits was always possible (Home depot, Lowes, Nordstrom, etc.)

I thought it was something I did, but now I'm finding out that it's more heavy than I even realized. 

He's been on opiates since he had a motorcycle accident about a year before the fight we had, and I never considered that this could be an issue since it was to manage pain. I didn't know he kept taking them afterward, I had no clue that he had a dependency since the accident. 

Fast forward 5 years, he's lost his work, got kicked out of his home, is now living on my moms couch, and I found out today that my dad caught him robbing his house for money and gas. I guess he's been doing it for a long time but was finally caught. My dad said he had a nice bruise on his arm between tattoos, and he thinks he's switched from pills to needles. 

My issue is this: id really like to be a part of his life and I'm afraid that he's not going to let me in - not because he doesn't love me but because he doesn't want me to be a part of this life of his. I want him to know I love him no matter what but I'm not sure how to get back into his life, especially knowing he's an addict who probably feels very private about his life and choices right now. 

What can I do to get around the walls and be a part of his life? I want to be there for him, especially now that I know he could use my support more than ever.

I made a few threads through the detox bitching about kratom not working but we did it. Got jobs and things seemed great at first.

Fuck crystal meth.

We were lethargic from the detox and had alot on our plates so we started buying a ten dollar bag of crystal to split and sniff before work. We would shoot almost a .5 each rarely when doing dope to spice things up but i never imagined it would steal the love of my life.

While the small amount didnt effect us bad at first my gf started to believe she was soooooo depressed and needed it and when i tried to set some limits on the use she started lying to me and hiding it from me driving a huge wedge between us.

4 months after kicking a gram a day IV dope habit and countless ""were breaking up"" fights we had a big blowup, i left and she slept with an 18 year old (were 28). I grabbed a backpack full of clothes and went back to new orleans, alone with no where to go, no phone, and only 14 dollars to my name.

I was so pissed and driven 3 days later i had my old job back, worked the whole weekend, found a place to stay, and gotten laid. I got locked out of where i was staying for 3 hours at 3am on the third day so i went to the casino to see how long i could drink on ten dollars in the slot machine and immediately hit the jackpot for 800. Im not gonna lie i cried. Because all the good that has happened to me when i was expecting to be sleeping on the streets for weeks until i got a paycheck or two shows me its over.

Had she not slept with that kid id have taken here back. We havent spoke once in almost two weeks but shes still in AL in a trailer doing meth with this 24yo girl who just had her children removed. And i guess banging barely legal black dudes (i had no idea that was her thing)

6 years down the drain. We had good intentions but a little meth destroyed us.

I hear shes on FB dropping hints she wants me back and im sure once things stop working in AL she will be at my doorstep but i cant do it anymore.

Papaver... latin for poppy or a corruption of piper meaning pepper and aver meaning africa?

Origins said to be from mediterranean, himilayas, afghan, se asia. Well, oldest seeds yet found were possibly in isreal, 9000 yrs old. Just next to africa. And almost everywhere man has gone and the plant can grow, ancient seeds have been found. This leads me to believe the theory of african origin which parallels origin of homo sapiens. 

It is supposed to be hard to find any wild somniferum. North africa has wild opium. 

There is a plant genus called combretum. Several species of which have been called ""opium antidote"". With such a large geographic distribution as that genus has, i wondered if the most effective species for our purposes might come from the same place as somniferum species of poppy (or opium). the two most likely candidates I could find for opium antidote were (combretum) sundaicum and micranthum. Sundaicum is from se asia and micranthum is from africa. Sundaicum was mentioned to be cytotoxic in many papers, and promoted by groups who hate opium where micranthum was not apparently cytotoxic to anything but cancer cells and tumors. Relieves fever and a whole list of symptoms which resemble w/d symptoms. Allegedly got its name as it was used by Chinese to kick opium smoking habits which are allegedly among the hardest of all to break. 

Has a load of great properties and can be gotten for a low price. Henriettes herbal lists instructions for use. 

I am excited to try it. 

Kratom did not do the trick for me and I even went to its origin to get it fresh. Met many people there who had used it successfully but I guess I was different. 

Saw 4 or 5 posts on combretum within reddit but all about a nasty sounding variety and not one on micranthum. Ordering it this week. Will report personal account of usage once it arrives. ",1505331993.0

So about a month ago, I call my weed plug of 4 or 5 years and let him know I need to pickup. He abruptly informs me that he's exited the game. With no warning. Now, me a friend, and my dad, have used this guy weekly for years, so several people are out in the cold here.

I franticly  contact everyone I think that could be of help, and thankfully, a friend from work can help out. I pick her up, we go to the city, I'm introduced to new dude, I pickup my ounce, pay the man, and head.

Next week.  I get ahold of the middle who introduced me and asked if I could get dudes number from her. After some hassle  (aparently, they used to fuck) I get the number and go back to the city to cop a qp to help some folks out and get my ounce for like $20.  Everything's beautiful.

Fast forward. Call dude, pick up, repeat. Then, today, as I go to pick up my 3 ounces, I mention to dude that if he ever has anything else, let me know. I fucks with it. (I had a hunch this might work, as 1st time I went down there, someone came over sounding kind of angry,  and dude handed him some cash.  Turns out he accidentally sold the guy fake percocets. Blank presses. And was actually giving dude his money back and apologizing! I've been waxed for prop pills before, but I never got my money back and an apology).

He asks me what I mean, I let him know that I fuck with boy and girl (local terms for dope and coke respectively) and that my wife likes meth. He opens a little box that has a baggie with 3 small gel caps of brown and a baggie of hard. Let's me know the ""hard is supreme"" and that the dope isn't great, but has next to no fentanyl in it, which is damn near impossible to come by where I am. Fucking overdose capital of the world. Like, they're opening a DEA office local as a pilot program for a nationwide plan. It's bad. I've lost a dozen close friends and family Last 2 years. It sucks. Fuck fent; anyways, I tell him I prefer soft, but am interested in the dope. The man throws me a point, says no charge, and I'm on my way.

Driving home, couldn't have been happier. Since I've been back north, I've lost all my connects and was getting middled HARD on everything to the point of just saying fuck it and relying on poppy straw and piecing together smoke from different sources to get by. Looks like things are changing. I've copped damn near a pound from my man this month and now I find out he keeps dope and hard on deck and can get damn near everything except pills with some notice. Says he doesn't trust selling pills right now because he can't be sure they aren't presses or bunk. And that's a good thing. My man's a pro it would appear. Grinding is his full time job. Not a side hustle.

Side note, I feel like this may have happened because I gave a homeless dude on the side of the road on the way to the city a $20 and a joint. My man was SICK af and very appreciative. (Growing up, I had an uncle that was a hobo. Like rode the rails to Alaska and shit to build the pipeline. Every year or so we'd have to go down to a shelter or a greyhound spot and pick him up. He'd be all beat up and emaciated. One time lost a foot passing out in a car up north to frostbite. Anyways, I've always had a soft spot for the homeless and junkies and regularly give them bills larger than singles and bits of weed if I've got it on me to spare.  Wife didn't like it at first, but she's learned to live with it. A guy could have worse flaws than being a junkie and over generous with panhandlers (I'm aware I'm getting waxed a lot and still don't care. I'd want someone to do it for me were the tables turned.)

TL;DR: new weed plug hooked it up with a tester of some dope. And let me know he keeps it on deck. HORRAY.",1505323227.0

Well since then I have tried about everything out there.  Weed, mushrooms, pcp, coke, crack, lsd, morphine, percs.  Well you get the picture.   
 
   Most recently I was injured (5 years) and was placed on ocy 15's 4x a day. I have survived like that most of this time (had to supplement a few times).  About 8 months ago a bud of mine introduced me to ppt, and that has been my goto when i run out of my oxy (which is happening earlier and earlier lately). 
 
   Recently the pain has been getting worse and I am using more and more oxy and PPT.  BTW poppies are fucking expensive as hell!  So in comes the dnm and .5 gram of black.  
 
   Here is the question.  I have a pretty good tolerance for opiates but the only thing I have never done (if you read my long list you would know) is H.  Never tried it in any form, no boofing, no plugging, no slamming etc.  So how much of this .5 gram do I do?  Do I inject? In the rectum? or monkey water it?

70916g,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/70916g/addiction_anxiety/,4,https://redd.it/70916g,PontiffTheGreat,Addiction Anxiety,"**This sounds absurd but it's what I'm feeling :(**

I have posted here before seeking opinions regarding my recent opiate consumption: 280mg oxycodone & 3g codeine~. Last week I started developing a fear (having read a lot about opiate addiction and anecdotes online) of becoming addicted and/or having my mind plagued by thoughts of opiates. I ceased my use of opiates this week as advised and am not planning (or even really wanting) to use further.

**I am still getting the occasional craving/""oh here's a reason why I could get high""-type thought but the potential consequences and seeing these mechanisms of potential addiction at work puts me off very quickly.** These cravings/urges/automatic thoughts are what started scaring the **SHIT** out of me. It all felt innocent and I found myself going from using a couple of days in a row to a semi full-on binge over about 2 weeks with two days using to each day sober.

Essentially I guess the underlying fear is that my newly found appreciation of life after my mental health crisis has been tarnished by my use of opiates; that I may now remain plagued with cravings/general rumination. 

**I really, really fundamentally and rationally do NOT want to use and I don't intend to, nonetheless these automatic cravings/thoughts that pop up are justifying a whole host of irrational judgements/conclusions/anxiety about my state of mind/substance abuse status which while I am aware is likely somewhat catastrophized and unrealistic, still feels very real.**

I am aware that all things change and given my mental health progress I haven't worked myself up into a panic, I have been practicing mindfulness, willingness and exposure through meditation to good effect. Nonetheless my baseline anxiety levels are rather high and I have a sort of opiate shadow/weight of anxious culpability all the time.

Also, I've mixed both of the above with alcohol before, just not together. If I did take both, would I still be able to get a drink or two in?

So guess what guys I did some research and I found out heroin is FUCKING AMAZING.

My extensive research involved the following:

* Ruined friendships and family relationships
* Demolition derby with my life
* Lost countless number of jobs
* Lost like 5 years of my life 
* Lost the love of my life (she was clean, I lied to her and she caught me and cut me off after a 4 year relationship & had plans to get engaged)
* Gained a bunch of street cred
* Street cred soon turned out to be BAD street cred when I thought it was a good thing
* Gave away my cat that I LOVED because I chose getting high over keeping my cat (couldn't afford food, wasn't around enough or alive enough to tend to and care for my cat properly so I did the right thing in the grand scheme of things
* Friend turned to heroin, didn't tend to cat, cat dies
* Got a whole bunch of these awesome friends that would pick me up at any time I wanted them to as long as I had a bunch of money to spend and / or drugs previously
* Got arrested with ~500 Xanax bars while nodded out, thanks heroin
* Went to rehab hoping to lower my prison sentence on the Xanax charge
* Stayed clean for like 6 to 9 months can't recall exactly but I'd say leaning more towards 9 months.
* Relapsed at 9months saying ""I'll only do it this one time now I won't go back to it ever again because I now have the ""skills"" and ""coping mechanisms"" the $40,000 rehab taught me.
* Got arrested again, this time had a bunch of heroin and crack on me. Cops let me walk, my friend; the driver, was my closest friend at the time but he ratted on me and after looking at my own personal memorabilia copy of the police report he went on to say I was his drug dealer and everything in the car was mine, he flopped on me in a heart beat.
* Charges pile up now, two counts of intent to distribute narcotics, I went through another treatment (AKA rehab for those who haven't got that far with this game yet).

**Closer to present time**

* Treatment costed like 50 grand, insurance paid most of it but I am still paying it off, I am currently clean of heroin since about May 2017.
* I moved 10 hours away from my home state where I had lived my whole life
* I left all of my friends and family behind, all for my recovery
* Court system decides that my Xanax charge is no longer being dropped because I got re-arrested even though the Xanax charge happened over a year ago.
* Even though I have an awesome full time job, going to school full time majoring in Computer Science, bought myself a nice 2004 Chrysler Sebring in a beautiful state far away from heroin / home state 
* Even though I'm doing everything right, doing as I was told and taught by treatment facilities therapists family friends reddit friends/fam/etc the court system does not care about you or your health or your addictions or problems because I have been forced to travel 10 hours back and forth every 4-6 weeks now due to this bullshit of a court case.
* My second arrest was for only 7 grams of cannabis in a state where that is a simple ticket-- but somehow I am being tried for intent to distribute; filthy cops lied and typed up 77.0g instead of 7.00g and I found the error had investigators go weigh out the product prove it ---

**Only to find out today that**

I am fucked any way, because the amount did not determine much at all -- the prosecutor will not budge and says I'm doing time whether I like it or not. (Who likes doing time? Lol?).

They are trying me with possession of narcotics for 7 grams of shatter. No scale no packaging materials etc. Wasn't even my car. 

Heroin caused that to happen, if I didn't have heroin in my life then the whole second arrest wouldn't have occurred.

Now after coming back to my home town for the second time-- the cravings that were NON EXISTENT have come back full fledge randomly while here in my home town and guess what? There is nothing, there is no one that will be able to stop you when you are going to use. I just bought three bags and got high.

I just got high..now it's back on an airplane back to where I need to be with my job school new life only to realize that I will be brought back to this exact spot in roughly 6 weeks only to most likely relapse again.

I'm stuck in a relapse cycle because the court system keeps bringing me back into the heroin infested state and I forsee getting arrested again and relapsing again and again until this whole charge is over with.

I guess I just wanted to speak openly with someone about all of this, and what a better place to do it than my home? r/Opiates I love every single one of you, you will all live long and prosper and I have faith in every single one of you. This is not a preaching post by any means, I apologize if it appears that way fellow opiate lovers (hate or love??).

Last time I tested the Dr let me know that there was a positive for methadone in my urine.... Which was absolutely crazy because I've never taken methadone in my life.

Anyway, she said that it was just a urine screen and wasn't sent for confirmation testing (the more detailed testing called gc/ms, I'm assuming?)
Anyway, so today I gave another urine sample in order to clear things up.

My question is: what could have caused a false positive for methadone? I also take kratom on days when my pain isn't bad enough to warrant a percocet pill, so could that have caused a false methadone positive? If so, will the gc/ms testing be able to verify that it was kratom and not methadone?  (kratom is completely legal where I am, by the way)

Here's a list of what was in my system that day I gave the sample that came back with the false positive for methadone:

Pyridium
Oxycodone/acetometaphine
Kratom 

I know I didn't take any methadone, nor have I ever taken methadone, but I'm still scared because I would hate to lose my pain contract for something I didn't do. Anyway, I'm a bit of a control freak and the fact that I'm waiting around for a test done by a lab tech I don't know in order to prove my innocence is driving me nuts.

Sorry this is long and probably disorganized, but I appreciate any input that anyone can give to help at least ease my mind. ",1505443418.0

I'm just trying to think who is less likely to catch me using, and if I were caught using, who is less likely to kick me the fuck out? ..... Thx lol. 

(Pls don't be like ""don't plan ur living situation around using"" cause I'm suuuuper easy to live with, tiny footprint, keep to myself, very friendly so the only problem I could foresee is being caught using since everyone thinks I have months of clean time. Most ppl gonna  say it's obvious I should live with my buddy seeing as he's such an ideal friend but, who knows, maybe my parent is reformed and has calmed down with age, maybe my seemingly perfect friend has skeletons for daaaaaaays.

I took pills for a few years prior to that. Im so fucking tired of struggling every day. Waking up sick. Working to supply a drug I don't even like. Borrowing money from everyone i know. The list goes on. Anyways, point being in serious about getting well. I've been trying to taper the last week or so. I've had a couple of splurge days I guess you could say. Prior to attempted taper I was doing about .5 a day, more if i could get it. On the days in the last week that I did more than i intended it was about .3 (.2 of it at once that night). That was last night. I've done about a quarter of a .1 so far today. I got my hands on about 10 strips. How long would you wait before taking the strip? I figure ill start with a quarter and see what happens. I've basically been mildly withdrawing for like a week so im not sure what im looking at exactly in the short term future. I feel shitty but have deff felt way worse and not too long ago. But also I've done like, basically no stuff today and feel mildly shitty. Im rambling. Sorry.


Tldr: I feel kinda shitty and dropped from .5 a day to a quarter of a .1 today. Can I take this strip?",1505434597.0

I tend not to mess around with opiates, but I admit that I do go through phases of being a heavy drinker.

Today I ran out of Roxy's I had for a leg injury, and they've started me on 5/325mg Norcos instead. One pill every eight hours. I know some people take a lot more at once.

I'm wondering - I've had only one Norcos (four hours ago) so far. Think I'm safe to drink a growler of beer (~5 beers)?",1505434184.0

And then I had some extra cash and picked up some more. Not a lot though. I was just gonna chip off it for a few days then my wife and I had a fight and she's throwing around divorce. Shot the rest of my stash last night and then picked up a gram this morning. D boy took forever and I was starting to withdrawal.

During that time I decided I was gonna come clean and tell my wife.

She says I never open up to her and she feels like she doesn't even know me. I want her to know me and u want to be with her. But I'm afraid that when I tell her she'll leave anyways. I guess we'll see what happens.

I'm going to try to ween myself off with this gram I got after binging a but tonight. I'm scared but I'm also tired of feeling alone. I want to live a normal life. I want to get clean. But I also want to get high so bad.

Since then I've gotten married and had two kids. My youngest is 8 months old. I completed nursing school and I work in a hospital; I love my job. I've never misused my license or diverted or anything like that.

Over the years I've had a couple prescriptions for oxycodone after car accidents that I've binged on. Literally like 4-5 prescriptions in 12 years. I do have chronic pain issues but have always managed them with NSAIDS. 

Fast-forward to my pregnancy last year. I was in two car accidents, one minor, one pretty bad. No NSAIDS in pregnancy. My OB gave me oxycodone. Somewhat liberally. I was judicial with it because of my pregnancy. But once I gave birth I was diagnosed with a blood clot and am on warfarin therapy. Again, chronic pain with poor pain management choices. More oxycodone. Now just binging, no reason not to. 

I'm thinking about the oxycodone all the time now. I want it all the time and I am terrified of it, because I know it will rob me of everything I've worked my ass off for. 

The only time I really can honestly say I don't want it is when I'm smelling my baby's neck. Something about him and his baby smell reminds me how fucking serious this could get. The thought of my preschooler daughter maybe someday understanding that I was high makes me feel tons of shame too. They deserve so much better than me. I just feel fucking broken. 

I need to stop this. I think I need to rat myself out to my OB. I need to get off this warfarin so I can manage my pain in a way that has always worked for me. 

I've just felt really isolated and alone with this secret for the last year. Typing it out has given me some clarity if nothing else. 

I'm totally out of oxycodone and would have to ask for more to get it. Maybe I can just...not ask for more?",1505415307.0

Now I know something's wrong (obviously) Go to hospital, they  run tests and can't figure out what's wrong. I get admitted 9/24/15. I won't leave the hospital until 11/2/15. The first 2 weeks are a blur really. In between excruciating headaches, every joint in my body aching, feverish to the point my bed was shaking, felt I couldn't breathe at times so I was given oxygen. Throwing up even though I haven't eaten in over 2 weeks. They inserted a PICC line one night. Was getting anti biotics and morphine every 4 hours.  Once the right anti biotic  was found I gradually got better over the next 3-4 weeks. Still felt AWFUL but at least the fevers were subsiding.  It got so bad I was delirious. Talking to things and saying things that made no sense then I guess I'd stare off into space for long periods of time (so I'm told) To make a long ass story just long. BE CAREFUL. This can kill you. I was lucky I didn't need open heart surgery and it was caught in time. Doc said I would've died if I waited longer. Scary shit my friends. Just my story.

Apparently he got some dope earlier that is hard as a rock and is wanting to know the safest way to crush it up without it flying everywhere. I don't have any experience with rock hard shit like that. (He said he will only snort it. Won't smoke it or shoot it, so those options are out.

So I suggested he put some of the little pieces in a plastic, but still sturdy, straw. Then fold the straw in half with the rocks at the crease, hold both ends closed and then chew/bite on the straw until the rocks inside are all crushed up into powder. Straighten out the straw holding one side shut, put the open side of the straw in your nose and blast off. 

That's how I've always done it. Pretty much no matter what I was snorting. 

Anyone have any other advice for him? Best way to crush up hard ""rocks"" etc?

Therefore I was wondering what I could do with these 40mg ER pills? I want to get a similar effect to what I had when I ate the Oxynorms, and obviously 40mg is too much for me to handle with no experience prior to this. 

Can I cut these up into 4/8 smaller pieces and try from there? Will this effect be similar to what I got from the OXN?

I'm going to write a wall of text about how it all started for me, and maybe give regular updates for those who are interested in having a read.

I've been an addict for around 5-6 years. I have severe clinical depression and anxiety like most people on this subreddit, so when I ran out of weed I started looking online for ""highs at home"" and did a little bit of reading on poppy seed tea. At any supermarket where I live, they sell 250g jars of poppy seeds and when I started using they were virtually unwashed so they were fantastic and very, very cheap. I'd get paid and spend all my money on jars of seeds and quickly became interested in other opiates. In my country you can get a box of 40 tablets containing 15mg of codeine and 500mg of paracetamol, so I started researching how to extract the codeine and came across cold water extractions and that's where everything went downhill... but at the time, it changed my life for what I thought was for the best.

Every single day I would go to the four pharmacies that were in my location and pick up a box of the tablets mentioned before which contained a total of 600mg per box. And every 5 days I woukd go back and pick up more boxes. Sometimes I'd go into town and pick up more boxes from all the pharmacies located around that area.

I just started with 200mg one day and a few days later I'd do another 200mg. But eventually it got to the point where I was doing 200mg every day. My tolerance got greater, so I'd up my dose 100mg at a time. Soon I was doing 600mg a day. One day I had no money and no codeine and felt very strange, it was as if I had the flu, I spent hours on the toilet with crippling stomach cramps, while sweating, being too hot and so cold I was shaking. It had occured to me that I was in withdrawals and I had become addicted, like every other addict said they'd never be. I came to the realization that it was too late and I should keep going because it feels good, and I thought being an addict was super cool for some reason.

When I finally got paid, I went on trips picking up boxes of codeine at every possible pharmacy I could. But 600mg wasn't doing it for me anymore, so I did two boxes, 1.2g of codeine a day... until my girlfriend came to visit from overseas. I stored all the empty boxes instead of throwing them away, I got defensive, lied and said I was selling them to a friend, but she wasn't stupid enough to believe me. I got mad and started blaming it on her, that she was the reason I was using, which was wrong. I did it because I enjoyed it, and I thought it was too late for me to quit. She persuaded me to stop using codeine and only have poppy seed tea because she thought that wasn't as bad and not as expensive, but I knew that there were more opiods in tea than there were in the tablets and that if I was to get high, of need a lot of 250g seeds to get high. A few years later I'm using 2kg+ of seeds every single day, I loved it and so did she because I had so much energy, I was happy and affectionate which I never was before. I would do codeine only when they were out of seeds.

One day, I bought my seeds, went home, made the tea and was waiting for it to kick in, but it never did because they started washing their seeds. I was so angry and upset, so I went to my pharmacy to pick up another box. Like I used to do, I went to another pharmacy to pick up another box, but I was informed that all pharmacies keep a record of what you buy, so I couldn't get more than one box a day, this became a problem. I would get friends and family to buy them for as often as I could, saying I had a back problem, and that worked for quite a while until I moved out and quit my job because it was too far to travel, the real reason was that I had no money to get codeine and couldn't work while withdrawing.

I'd score oxy 80's and oxycodone as often as I could, but I never could get a sturdy supply, so I got flatmates and my girlfriend to buy codeine for me for the last year or so. I could never find heroin, but I tried so many times. I know now that if I had found a source, I would have died by now because I would keep trying to get higher and higher, as I'm sure all you guys know all about.

This last month I've finally gotten tired of always being sick and never being able to get high anymore. I only do 600mg-1200mg of codeine a day or seeds if my farmers market has the unwashed ones in stock, which is NOTHING in comparison to a lot of you guys doing grams if heroin at a time, but for me, what I do is way too much to get clean without help. I've tried quitting cold turkey, I've tried using every method I've seen on the internet, but I can never get past the 3rd day before cravings kick in and I'm doing 1200mg of codeine again. So I decided to finally go around quitting in a way that would be more realistic for me.

I'd been thinking about telling a doctor, or doing some research and finding a specialist, but I never did. I'm pretty much only deciding to quit now because I came across the opportunity by chance almost. I was at my weekly appointment at my job search centre, was high and spoke a little too much, saying that I had other reasons why I couldn't get a job, I told the guy in charge of helping me look for a job that I was an addict, he asked what I was using and he set me up with a counselor. I had my appointment with her and she set me up with a doctor that I could speak to... And it went amazingly well, she got me in contact with the opiod treatment centre that I'm visiting in two days. I'm going in suboxone/subutex (not sure which just yet) and am going to wean off over a few months/years.

I'm really excited to finally have assistance with withdrawing and getting clean. I know buprenorphine is more addictive, but I'm certain it's going to help me as long as I do what the doctor says. I know it's going to take work, effort, willpower and a lot of maintenance, but I know I can do this now that I have medical help and a great support system. But I'm also completely terrified of failing... So many people get on now but go back to using... I don't want that to happen to me. The saying is that you can only truly quit if you actually WANT to quit... I'm so certain I want to quit. I'm so tired of doing this to everyone around me. I'm so tired of being poor all the time. But most importantly, I'm so tired of being so dependant on opiates to even get out of bed. I'm certain I can quit, but I'm so scared that maybe deep in my subconciousness that I don't want to quit and that if I get clean, I'll be too tempted and I'll use again... But I guess that's years from now.

If you got through that boring novel about my life story and are reading this, thank you for reading. I've wanted to share this with someone since only 3 people who aren't doctors that know about this situation. 

Please share your thoughts/experiences in quitting and/or how your experiences with buprenorphine went, I'd love to see what I have in store.

I've been reading this sub for quite a while but this is my first time making an account and posting.

To make a long story short, I've been in chronic pain for a little over 8 years now, and I'm currently receiving Hydrocodone 10-325mg (Norco) and Oxycodone 10mg (with instructions to take 1-2 every 4-6hrs for both medications) to deal with pain not covered with my Oxycontin. From my understanding this is a little unusual, and I'm currently in a bind: my medication and dosage hasn't changed in several years (4+), and it's getting to the point where if I take both at the same time (20mg hydrocodone & 20mg oxycodone) for severe pain it's not cutting it anymore. To keep up with the increased pain I've been having lately, I started bumping up my dosage to 30mg of each medication. Ultimately doing this is just going to cause me to run out early so I need to find a solution quick.

To my knowledge Hydrocodone only comes up to 10mg IR, and I know that Oxycodone goes up to 30mg IR, but since I've been taking both medications at the same time I'm not sure what a good ""next step"" would be. I have a doctors appointment coming up at the end of this month, but I'm at a loss in terms of what my game plan is. From what I've found online most conversations are only talking about dosage adjustments with one medication, or one IR medication and one ER medication. I'm already taking 6x Hydrocodone 10-325mg and 6x Oxycodone 10mg a day, so increasing the quantity isn't a good option, right?

Since I almost always take the Hydrocodone and the Oxycodone together I'm not sure if the Hydrocodone is still working well enough to keep taking it or move on. Likewise, I assume the Hydrocodone acts symbiotically with the Oxycodone so that 20mg of each would work better than just 30mg of Oxycodone. 

Would anyone care to weigh in on my options or give some advice? I'd really appreciate it!",1505547159.0

Thoughts appreciated.,"**REPOST for further responses. Id like some more thoughts on this line of thinking. Much appreciated.This may sound absurd but it's what I'm feeling :(**

I have posted here before seeking opinions regarding my recent opiate consumption: 280mg oxycodone & 3g codeine~. Last week I started developing a fear (having read a lot about opiate addiction and anecdotes online) of becoming addicted and/or having my mind plagued by thoughts of opiates. I ceased my use of opiates this week as advised and am not planning (or even really wanting) to use further.

**I am still getting the occasional craving/""oh here's a reason why I could get high""-type thought but the potential consequences and seeing these mechanisms of potential addiction at work puts me off very quickly.** These cravings/urges/automatic thoughts are what started scaring the **SHIT** out of me. It all felt innocent and I found myself going from using a couple of days in a row to a semi full-on binge over about 2 weeks with two days using to each day sober.

Essentially I guess the underlying fear is that my newly found appreciation of life after my mental health crisis has been tarnished by my use of opiates; that I may now remain plagued with cravings/general rumination. 

**I really, really fundamentally and rationally do NOT want to use and I don't intend to, nonetheless these automatic cravings/thoughts that pop up are justifying a whole host of irrational judgements/conclusions/anxiety about my state of mind/substance abuse status which while I am aware is likely somewhat catastrophized and unrealistic, still feels very real.**

I am aware that all things change and given my mental health progress I haven't worked myself up into a panic, I have been practicing mindfulness, willingness and exposure through meditation to good effect. Nonetheless my baseline anxiety levels are rather high and I have a sort of opiate shadow/weight of anxious culpability all the time. This begs to be interpreted that I may have seriously messed up and/or am doomed.

Your thoughts are appreciated as while I have a lot of experience managing irrational anxiety this feels like something I absolutely **DID** do and **CHOSE** to do it. Forget potentially contracting a deadly illness due to chance I **CHOSE** to take these drugs and feel utterly terrible about it.",1505534798.0

so, recently my sister did some house sitting for a wealthy family over the course of one week. a few days ago she got paid for it and they paid her via check. now since it's 2017 she was able to cash the check via her phone just by taking a picture of it. as a result, the check is still in our house and i have access to it as she carelessly threw it on the floor of her bedroom lol. i'm really broke rn don't get paid from my job for another week and need money for dope bad or i'll be sick. so my question is, do you guys think it's a good idea to double deposit the check and get the easy cash? ($150) or will i get in trouble for fraud or something? i've already looked it up and it definitely is possible to deposit it and get the money i just don't know if i'll get caught bc being in the same family my sister and i bank through the same bank and i know that ups the chances. i also don't want the check to be removed from my account after i've already spent the money if the person she got it from notices. i guess that's the only risk. but then again it's only 150 and they are wealthy old people. what do you think? would you do it? if there's a better sub this should be moved to let me know but i figured my fellow junkies would have insight on something like this lol.

TLDR: i have a check made out to my sister for $150 that she deposited via smart phone and wonder if i should take the risk of double depositing it for dope money

I took it off today around noon and I have my Suboxone appointment in the morning to get back on it. Since Fentanyl works transdermally, does it take longer for your body to remove it? Am I safe to take the Suboxone 24 hours after taking the patch off, or should I wait longer? I just couldn't handle the precipitated withdrawals if they were to happen. Does anyone here have experience with switching straight from removing a patch to Suboxone 24 hours later or did you need to wait even longer than the suggested 24 hours?

I came back to my parents house to three cop cars and a bunch of fucking uniforms in the kitchen and my probation officer. My parents had called them. They show me the baggy and I tried to lie at first but they knew it was mine so I told them it was mine. What's fucking retarded is the told me it tested positive for coke, but it's ECP. Cops are fucking stupid. So my po tested me and I failed for THC and Opiods. But not coke. 

I'm still shook up about the incident. I was on unsupervised probation but now I'm gonna have to be seeing my po again. I may have to go to a compliance hearing and see a drug therapist/do another IOP program. I'm amazed that I didn't get a new charge, that I'm not locked up right now, that I still have my computer and my car. This is the wake up call. For now at least. I love opiates but I'm gonna have to take a hiatus. From everything. Get my mind right, get off probation, finally graduate high school. Of course my junkie self knows that I still have a gram of #3 coming in the mail and I want so badly to get it but I'm going to have a friend who is a non-user hold it for me so I'll have something to celebrate as soon as I get off papers completely, which is also when I'll be starting my business with my best friend and leaving my parents house. I don't know if this was divine intervention or JJ or bad luck that I got caught to good luck that nothing severe happened. I'm so confused and angry and relieved all at the same time. I'm gonna stay clean until I'm 100% off probation. Fuck the law. Fuck probation. Fuck cops. Fuck court. December 6th is the end of this shit.

I read 5-7 days for acute withdrawals.

I have a ton of oxy. My goal is to get through withdrawals, and then use only on Saturday mornings and Wednesday night occasionally.

So last night I took my dose. Today I am on kpins, gaba, and some Kratom. Xanax for sleep. I will use this for the next 8 days and then stop.

I'd like to use Sat AM, the 23rd. I want to at least TRY to chip. Got it, I'll likely fail. But my fav time to use opiates is Saturday morning, 7am. Cut a piece of coffee cake, drink a cup of coffee, and let the warmth come on, then lay down and listen to my fav podcasts. That will get me through the week I think. We will see. I get the risk of chipping. I have 150 oxy I am going to have the will power to resist while I withdraw. It's a good sign if I can avoid them during wd.

So back to the question. If I use ZERO opiates for 8 days, am I clear of wd, so using one dose won't set me back to square one? Plan for first four weeks is one dose a week, sat am.

So day one trying to quit wasn't too bad. I woke up, had a  little anxiety throughout the day, overthinking things, and felt little sluggish hardly no sleep. Day 2 much more of the same, but then that night is when the damn Beast hits me!!!! RESTLESS LEGS. I tried and tried fight it, but gave in around 2:30 and took 2 tramadol.

No power for almost 7 days, no water, a tree fell through my back room and another limb smashed the hood of one of my cars.

We've been living out of our other car, in the driveway and using solar yard lights in the house for lighting (genius idea btw). Being powerless and living out of a car for a week is expensive as fuck. All of our food eventually went bad and you couldn't find ice in town *anywhere*....nor bread or batteries. Ran out of drugs on day 1 and somehow sucked it up all week long.

One thing that really stuck with me was how generous everyone in town has been. On day 1 after the hurricane, I got a flat tire checking out the damage. Someone helped me change it and get back on the road. The next day I ran out of gas looking for more  gas (all the stations were powerless or out of gas.) A stranger with stockpiles of fuel in sealed buckets poured 5 gallons of gas into my tank and wouldn't take any money from me for it.

Really inspiring. 

It's been a week from hell and although we're utterly and hopelessly broke and I'm in the throws of withdrawal, I'm somehow hopeful about the future. That somehow everything will work out. 

I hope everyone else in the path has their power back on and didn't lose anything, especially any lives.

Hang in there everyone.

She informs me we have to eat dinner with her mom (gf & gf family are Vietnamese, I'm white btw) who wants to have dinner w/ her three kids for the first time since house suffered minor flooding in the hurricane...

Normally not a problem, but I had dosed 80 fkn gel caps DXM about 30 minutes before this phone call and wasn't feeling anything yet when we had to start getting ready..

My gf uses drugs but for some reason I decide to hide that I had taken the gel caps.

*Also, the other day I decided to randomly learn more about my girl's culture while she was at work (I was on a fucking ton of Valium) and ended up reading about the Vietnam War for a really long time, especially interested in a series of Vietnam War conspiracies...*

So we are on the way there and I am in that state of the DXM high where all you can think about is *do they know I'm high??* and my girl look so alien-like to me...

When we get to the house my girl is asking me if I'm OK, I play it off and a few minutes later we are at the dinner table..

Now being the only white person there and peaking on my DXM trip I manage to turn a harmless conversation about Korean BBQ into a very heated conversation about the Vietnam War conspiracies

 I didn't even have my info correct whatsoever- had the president wrong, I mentioned Europe, and I mentioned missing American POW's who I claimed were still in Vietnamese prison (many who would be in there 100's-110's if alive today).

I also tried showed her family a conspiracy video and got distracted by the most recent video I had watched on YouTube and decided to show them that instead...

the video is of a girl named Lanvy playing a Stevie Wonder guitar cover (make matters worse, she is a young Asian FML) 

Her traditional Vietnamese mother and her sister and sister in law got extremely offended (the mother and sister in law stormed away from the table)

About two minutes later the DXM made me sick and I sprinted into the kitchen and threw up in the mom's kitchen sink (LOL)

I was asked to leave & ended up getting a ride home from a friend & gf is staying with her mom texting me how fkn stupid I am

That went on for years. Stopped hanging out with the dude for a couple of years because I was the victim of a hustle on one too many occasions. The type of scenario where you drop your wallet, get it back without the money and are told ""it was probably my scumbag drug addict sister"" when it was obviously most likely him. That wasn't even the last straw. The last straw a few years back was when he kept telling about his pill connect being able to get $300 ounces of weed for $200. I eventually took him up on this offer and got nothing in return but text message lies and unanswered phone calls. 

In retrospect I understand the reasons for such scumbaggery since it was back when he was doing blues and H wasn't even considered an option. Doesn't make it right, but I can appreciate the reason for the choice. Back then he had an annoying girlfriend and this was his only option to avoid being dope sick that weekend. 

&nbsp;

A couple of years later events resulted in hanging with him again. He was adequately apologetic, still smoked if I was rolling it and cooled meals that I was able to eat. Maybe a year and a half or two after I started hanging with him that's when he offered me a bump of some pill. It was a while before I experienced any form of withdrawal symptoms but I can sort of understand why people conduct a hustle and or scheme when they have no money for more opoids.


&nbsp;

Things have been fairly even since. His own brother gets annoyed and avoids walking into stores with him because he's the type to toss things onto the counter every single time you're being rung up. ""I'll get you back later"" sometimes gets uttered. Every single fucking time, a donut, a kit-kat, etc. 

&nbsp;

Fast forward to last week. I'm at my weed guy's house hanging out. Already got credit out on an 8th when my friend calls and tells me of the night's plans. Someone is coming over with H for us to sample the night before pay day. My friend said the H guy would throw me a couple if I rolled up. I said ""I think I a have a blunt's worth in my grinder.. I'd have to run home and heck it's like an 80% chance."" So my friend is like ""can you get another bag on credit? even a 20?"" I'm like I only get 8ths, he only sells those and that's it. I stress that I want to get the money a week before my next pay day. I don't want to be stuck paying double to the weed guy on my pay day.

So I'm reassured that it'll be fine even though I know better than to trust this person to pay me back actual cash. He'll sooner break off a few bags of H then give back hard cash once it's in his hands. Always making some other deal to avoid handing back cash. On rare occasions if he has been paid that day and it's been strictly agreed upon up front, I can get change back.

&nbsp;

Ever since I got hard into opiates, I've cut back my weed consumption and purchasing. It got to a point where I stopped bringing weed to my friend's house when doing H or opioids. Not running out of weed has been really good for nights when I'm in WD or simply don't have opiates. Even when I have subs, I enjoy weed before bed or TV time. 

So most recently I get a bag of weed, I leave it at his house and every time I'm over I can roll it and smoke it with him. Now that the weed bag is empty, my friend has his last cash in the ATM. Gets more H as expected and now instead of getting my $40 I was given the option to get some subs. Well, I should have just enough to get me to pay day if I conserve but it wouldn't hurt to stock up on those. 

Point is, I'm not surprised. I'll be eating the cost of the weed he asked me to get on credit. I'm most certainly not sharing my reserve bluntsworth of weed that I a have at home. My weed guy isn't gonna bust my kneecaps between now and wednesday and he knows I always get him. 

&nbsp;

In all fairness, the friend who got me to get the weed on credit hooked me up with H this week when he got his big paycheck to get me through and helped me get some subs tho I actually payed for those. This pay day I should have some subs left. I might just buy my friend a couple of buns to get him back for what he got me during the past week and not get myself anything or not get a lot since it's pointless anyway. If I wasn't getting my friend some H because he helped me out last week, sure I'd have enough for a few days fun. However, getting for both of us.... that'll just clean out my pay check completely -- again. Fuck that, I need to buy parts for my ride and get a fucking haircut.

Especially the haircut, like I'll do that straight out of the starting gate. I've waited too long for that. I may even schedule the hair appointment ahead of time asap. If I didn't get a haircut, my friend woldn't care if I spend it on more dope if it benefited him. 

Also the sub connect is low so today would be the last day we can get more so that does actually work in my favor even. I'm not annoyed that my friend didn't pay me back directly for the weed to pay my bud guy but this is also a reminder of why I'll avoid this situation in the future. If I smoke him up it'll be from my supply, even if on credit it'll never be his credit which is secured by me anyway. Might as well cut the bullshit where possible.

&nbsp;

As always, stay safe, smoke weed if you want to get high but are not already addicted to opioids.",1505596980.0

70jbuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/70jbuf/shakespearean_dope_tragedy/,4,https://redd.it/70jbuf,SantasGooch,Shakespearean Dope Tragedy,"My last post I made to this sub I was lamenting my soon-to-be homeless ass. Luckily, I have spent only one night on the street due to the kindness of friends and fellow users. I've even been able to stay somewhat high, though it's usually been speed and not my drug of choice, your friendly neighborhood heroin. This is just for context and an update for all those who replied to that post. I really appreciate your kind words and I wish that in the last week I had taken more steps to getting my shit together than I have, but junkies gonna junk. That being said, the party is soon-to-be over and I'm likely checking into a halfway house and praying my ass off that things get better in the next few 24 hours.

Okay, now that that's out of the way...

I wake up this morning on a nice comfortable bedroom floor. I roll over from one achy side to the other and grope around in the semi-darkness of the room. Somewhere next to me tucked in the loose plunger cap of a rig is a little less than a half gram of heroin. How this fell into my lap is a story in and of itself, but basically I got it for 'middling'. Also in the room is a folded up coupon with a couple points of meth inside. Figuring that I'm not going to be able to fall back asleep on this oh-so-comfortable floor, I decide to get up and do a little baby goofball to start the day.

Into the bathroom I go. I eyeball a small amount of the meth and dump it into another plunger cap I've been using as an impromptu cooker (note: there doesn't have to be any actual cooking or heat used to mix a shot of tar and meth). Then I go to grab the tar from its cap, but of course it is sticky, dense, and a little on the hard side and I can't shake it out on the counter or just stab it with a rig and pull it out. So I resort to a set of nail clippers. 

Now at this point in the story I'd like to say I at least washed those clippers off in water and wiped them dry, because this isn't my permanent residence and who knows what kind of microfauna from others' toenails has accumulated on them over time. But in true junkie fashion the thought didn't even occur to me until just now and without any forethought I used the scraper attachment to yank the dope out of its cap. 

Yank might be too strong of a word but I was definitely not as gentle as I needed to be. Like a total dumbass, I was holding the little cap in the air just about level with my chest. It seems I momentarily forgot about the existence of gravity. For a second the chunk of dope balanced precariously on the edge of the scraper, and then it was pulled back towards the Earth. 

This particular part of planet Earth turned out to be a sink without any sort of drain stopper. 

Time slowed down as I watched my beautiful glossy chunk of euphoria tumble down the side of the sink into inevitable disappearance and disintegration. 

Truly, a dope tragedy for the ages.

The silver lining? I don't have a physical dependence right now thanks to over a week of abstinence (from heroin, not gonna lie I've been doing a fair amount of meth). The dope more or less fell into my lap yesterday. I hadn't sought it out but when asked if I could help someone procure some I couldn't say no. I had half a mind to sell it for some cash anyways. And I still have the meth. So I did what any true poly-drug addicted redditor would do, I made sure to bang that shit so I could write this shitpost.

I was shocked when I found out the equivalent would be something like 8 hydro 10s per day given how high I *don't* feel when using as directed.  

However, I do like to mix opiates with my drug of choice (weed) and was experimenting with how to catch a high off these.  Keep in mind, these are the gel pouches that can't be cut up into pieces.  If I'm reading the dosing and amounts correctly, only about 2/3rd's of the fent is released in the 72 hour dosing period, so I felt reasonably sure that there isn't too much left once removed to be recklessly dangerous but also enough that I'm not wasting my time.  

Not a fan of putting the used patch in my mouth as it seems sort of imprecise (almost overdid it the first time I tried) and it's frankly unappetizing since it's been stuck to my body for three days.  Definitely works though.  

Next, I tried carefully opening the pouch and putting a small dab of the gel on a q-tip.  Quickly swiped along my gumline and then put it under my tongue, trying not to swallow.  I like this method for taking orally - nice little rush without overdoing it.  

The final thing I tried was probably something I should have researched first, but I've been successfully mixing it with concentrate and smoking it on my (cannabis) dab rig.  Again, I started with a very small little dab of the gel on a wide-mouth dab tool and then scooped up some concentrate on the end.  I'm not sure I can explain the technique without pics, but I've been able to make it bubble and vape very slowly rather than disappearing in a splattering flash like my first few attempts, yielding really satisfying results.  

Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  They're first and foremost medicine for me, so I'm not looking to harvest unopened patches or anything.  Besides, I don't want to have a gap as I've already felt the surprisingly rough withdrawals that would happen if I do.

p.s. - I also like to rest my coffee mug against the patch when applied if I need a little bump in delivery.  Helps in the morning when I'm really stiff.  The heat (shirt in between) really moves things along.",1505595078.0

I'm tired of taking subs every day just to feel okay. How is this different from the dope shooting habit? Okay obviously I know it's different. I'm stable, sure. Who cares about being stable when you could be happy? I was happy every day as a junky. I was either high or contemplating the next high, which was euphoric in its own way (even if cold, shivering, pacing and shitting all day).

It's funny, it sounds like I want to relapse, but I really don't even want to. Too much fucking effort man. If normal life takes effort than a real fucking heroin/opana (which is even more expensive) habit takes that effort tenfold. All the hustling, wasting your valuable time waiting on someone with a fucking pill or dope or coke or whatever. Nodding, waking up sick, people and schemes falling through so you have to go to bed sick too, crying, kicking and tossing and turning. Waking up again feeling like shit and lying, stealing and/or cheating to get another fix if you have to. Going to work dopesick or missing days and getting bitched out and hated by your coworkers and managers for being a piece of shit without that pill in you or at least a bunch of benzos to not think about it for awhile. Wanting to die every day. Praying that God takes you before your time just because you've become so selfish you'd honestly take that over trying, once again, to turn things around. 

Listen to all those around you. ""Get a job, go to church or meetings, meet a nice person to share your life with, go to college, further your career, buy a house and a dog and picket fence, grow a garden, stop thinking about drugs so much, buy a boat and take up fishing."", etc. 

Nah, I can't do that. I never have. It sounds so damn boring, doesn't it? Maybe the best hope for me is to find some sort of middle ground. Maybe just stick to substances that most of society doesn't consider ""drugs"", like weed, alcohol and coffee. ...but then you gotta always have psychedelics ya know. Shit goes back to our native ancestors drinking ayahusca or peyote or whatever the fuck these shaman ass niggas could conjure up. Then... if those are okay, what's a little opium in the pipe now and then? It's only chipping right, and no one else has to know. We can even grow poppies in the back corner of our garden where no one else has to see! It's a perfect plan. The perfect drug.

I went into semi bad withdrawal for 4 days and now I am proud to say the worst is over and I don't have any physical withdrawal symptoms anymore. It really caught me by surprise that I got sick, but hey, I learned my lesson and won't do opioids again. I had myself under control and the cravings weren't even strong. But I got sick after two days none the less. Now I just feel slightly depressed and anxiety and got some barely noticable RLS left. That's just the PAWS I assume. Should be gone in a few days.

 I am just really glad I didn't get more when I got sick and instead just went through with it. Even though it was only two days of using the withdrawal is hell and you know how weak your mind gets when you're sick.

I don't know where I am heading with this post. I am just really glad I didn't fall into addiction again. There is some very slight craving, but not much at all. I won't order again now that I know that even dosing one time makes me sick. Really caught me by surprise.

Barely out of my neighborhood I get called by someone on the sidewalk. Ahh shit, had to turn around. 

&nbsp;

It was the new dboy. A few days ago his phone was off when a friend and I were looking for subs. He got back to us the day after saying that he was sick because he misplaced his dope. I believe him because I remember I once watched him spend a half hour trying to pull subs out of the inner wall of his shoes. One of the things he asked me on the sidewalk was whether I was able to get my hands on subs.

&nbsp;

Yeah I got the subs I needed, I tell him. He then goes on to explain to me how to take the subs. He says I gotta start with a higher amount then take less. Specifically, he was adamant about not taking too small of a dose on day one. 

Now correct me if I'm wrong, but **is it not best to take the smallest possible dose that works to get you well and to keep you well?**

&nbsp;

I expressed my opinion which I act on to be fact when taking subs. He then responds, ""I know you're made smart but **I've been doing this for twelve years.**"" This dude talks a lot and I somehow managed to only lose three minutes from my journey. If I had more time, I would've debated further but I'm certain he would not budge.

They are convinced that doctor/patient confidentiality and HIPAA means that this can not exist unless the patient authorizes it. They think that lying to a new doctor about past opioid prescriptions may be a good idea because they haven't ""authorized"" their past doctor to give out information on their history of controlled substances. Apparently they also don't realize that health care providers are allowed to discuss patient care with other health care providers, and don't need specific consent... but that's a whole other issue. 

They are completely wrong.

I was pretty sure 99% of the people over the age of about 16, living in the US, were aware of this. Am I wrong about that? Is there an entire society of uninformed people who really thinks that their history with controlled substances is not available to law enforcement and other care providers?

My parents are wanting me to go to rehab, and my doctor is urging me to get my use under control because he will no longer write anymore early refills for me. I've required one for the past two months and he's basically told me to suck it up and stick to what he scripts me. Which, I have no problem with. As a result I have been on a taper and am finally comfy at 37.5mgs of oxycodone. I will however need to bring that down to 30mgs in the next 5 days. I think it's very realistic and doable.

While all of this has been going on we've been looking into everything from rehabs, dual diagnosis centers to pain clinics. The rehabs and dual diagnosis places denied me based on the severity of my medical condition. Those places felt they would not be able to help me. It was both devastating and relieving to hear that. 

Anyway, there was this one program that took me two months to hear back from, and lots of paperwork had to be sent it. I got a call the other day that they're gonna take on my case! I'm SO EXCITED. It's not a detox or a rehab at all. It's a pain clinic that's 8hrs away from me. 

My appointment is in 2moths from now. They're doing a full day evaluation session. I arrive at 8am to coordinate paperwork and get information together with the receptionist. Then at 8:30 I meet with the Pain Specialist/Doctor for 75 minutes. They do a full intake and evaluation of my situation. That is followed up b 75 minutes of physical therapy consult and session and finallly ends with a 90 minute session with the pain psychologist. 

After that I go to lunch for an hour and come back to meet with the entire team for 30-45minutes to discuss what they think and any recommendations they may have for me regarding my situation. 

My trip is going to be open ended because they could have me stay for their inpatient program where they adjust medications, monitor your mental health, and stabilize you if you need it. It's all personalized for me specially and I'm so excited that they think they can help me after reviewing my medical records.

I plan to be as honest as possible too. For instance, I will admit to overtaking my script and that I have a tendency to abuse my medications to avoid going to the emergency room when I probably should just go to the emergency room. I probably wont mention snorting my medication but like I said I'll talk about how I've been doubling it up and just struggling. I also plan to be honest about my diet and what I've found works for my GI System and what does not work for it. 

So yah. They already told me they wont write me any narcotic scripts the first visit, which I'm 100% okay with since I can't accept it anyway because of my local pain specialist. 

Anywhoozles, I'm excited about it and had to share!",1505697901.0

Oxymorphone refill info appreciated,"Simple question I think - I'm soon going to be prescribed 30x 20mg oxymorphone, with the dose supposed to be 1 to 2 daily. Also will have 180x 15mg oxycodone (doc offered 90x 30s but I said I would rather dose them myself in 15mg increments).  The oxycodone as of now was not mentioned any refills which is wat I expected.
 My doctor mentioned that he would give me a refill so if I needed I could pick up the remaining 30x oxymorphone to make the 60 permonth. This is a new doc and not sure how this would work since my scripts have all changed recently. 

So how do you whom have had experience with this work? I'm sure it varies by state, but would he give me two separate scripts for the same month of each 30x 20mg oxymorphone? Or would he issue one and it specifies 1 refill. Just curious because I've usually gotten separate but have wondered if they simply do a refill if I bring the first bottle in and have it refilled. Main reason why is i travel quite a bit and if I'm out of town but I have my bottle with me that says 1 refill can I get it filled? I have a feeling the answer is a big fat NO but I figured I'd ask.

Please put the drug, (and for street drugs) the quality, the amount per day you use on average, and the route of administration. You could also include details like how many times per day you use, and how high you get each time.


I know it's hard to judge the quality of street heroin, I personally use this system to approximate the purity: 10% = poor 20% = fair 30% = good 40% = great +50% = excellent. Feel free to tell me if you think I'm off here.


I myself used to have a tolerance of 8mg suboxone a day, so I couldn't really get high on regular heroin. Now my tolerance is nil. Which is great because I got myself a little 20 sack of heroin today and I get to enjoy the full strength of the effect. Anybody else still managing to use opiates without getting a tolerance (considering how difficult this can be)?

I've popped my fair share of percs up to 20-40mgs. That was many years ago. I'm no stranger to opiates but my tolerance is certainly nonexistent. 

Got myself a perc 10 which is a complete rarity in my parts. Won't be seeing them (or at least real ones) again anytime soon, so I wanna make the most of it. 

I've heard that both benzos and coke compliment oxy/opioids very, very well. Xanax and coke are two drugs that not only do I have them currently, I also have a much high tolerance to. I was thinking either take my perc with a nice line of coke, or the other option being taking maybe 0.5-1mg xan. Keep in mind my xan/coke tolerance is  decent.

What would you guys do in my position? Which drug compliments oxy better? Also, if I were to go the xanax route - if I dose around 7-730pm am I gonna be so rocked that I won't wake up for work tomorrow? 

And before you guys say don't do it, etc etc. I know opiates are a slippery slope, I know many people who have gone down that road. Fortunately for me I don't think I'll be running into any percs any time soon and I already got this pill so at this point I just want to enjoy it and get the most out of it.  

Thanks guys!

TL;DR - No opiate tolerance but got myself a perc 10. Should I take it with a decent line of coke or 0.5-1mg xan for the best affects? Have decent tolerance to coke and xan. 

Edit: Went with a decent sized line of coke. Took away a bit from the oxy, but it was still pretty damn euphoric. When I first a perc 10 at 16yrs old I nearly nodded out, I'm expecting similar affects when the coke wears off.",1505685884.0

Thats another thing, I'm super self conscious about my sweating while at work. I feel gross and ugly when I sweat. This generates over to feeling gross altogether even while not sweating.  It's like some kind of OCD-like behavior.

So, I'm currently prescribed a lower dose of remeron for sleep, along with gabapentin for anxiety. The gabapentin works, but it tends to sometimes give me a fidgety energy. I want a benzo to actually make me comfortable in my own skin and calm, but my doctor told me prescribing a benzo with suboxone is not allowed. Great.

I picked up, used 1.5X the amount normally - waiting for it- nothing.  Great.  Refusing to IV again, I just doubled up on my dose.

This is based on first hand knowledge going to Mexico multiple times monthly into Tijuana and trips into Cancun and the like. 

The only medication of any value you'll get at are a pharmacy is soma, codeine, Ritalin, valium, and xanax. All are legitimate pills and will be either bottled or in blister packs. Legally you are supposed to have a prescription for them, which if they ask they'll direct you a few doors down and you get one for $10. They also have animal pharmacies where you'll find your steroids, HGH, and most importantly ketamine.  

They don't sell any type of opiates at the pharmacy besides some codeine products. They will try to sell you percodan as percocet, it's just worthless worthless NSAIDS. You can't bring back any medication that is scheduled without a valid US prescription. 

Border towns like in Tijuana there is a huge black market for pills, you can get any pharmaceutical you want. Ironically enough they are all brought in from the States. People who get their prescription through Medi-Cal or the VA will go south and sell their prescription for cash or trade it for their DOC. 

In terms of finding the pills, just walking in an area with a large amount of pharmacies will have people asking if you want whatever pill they are selling. Same rules apply down south, don't let your money walk. Worse case scenario is asking a taxi driver, you'll just pay a tax for the product.

I've been clean a week but I realize that stopping opiate use forever is a weak and absurd option based on lack of self control. If opiates can be used no more than once or twice a week with a low and capped maximum dosage and a safe roa than there's hardly a threat.

Here's a list I've created for the next time I hop on some opiates.

Checklist for proper opiate use to ensure no more withdrawal or addiction and dependence

1. Go at least 1 month without opiates 
2. Only take twice a week 
3. Only take on weekends 
4. No more than 40mg hydrocodone only (50 MAX)
5. Only take during a window between earliest starting at 945am and latest dose at 1230pm
6. The last dose should be before 1230pm and the last chance to get all the 50mg through the day 
7. No oxycodone or other substances except hydrocodone
8. No insufflating or any other ROA except oral (no blues)
9. Give pills to Robert (a family member in my house) and make sure he dispenses the required amount when needed during weekends and at the right time only (he won't use my pills)
10. During travel in airport only hydrocodone use and can be used on any day and any time before 6pm otherwise no using after 6pm. 
11. when travelling to another city (the further the city the more I can use) it is permitted to use any day even on weekdays and until 4pm but no later than 4pm and no more than 3 days of continued use and no more than 50mg max. After 3 days of continued use I must stop and only use on weekends and only twice per weekend.
12. Must use the gym and run a cardio session on the days used
13. Should use naltrexone 3 days after using in doses up to 10mg to reverse tolerance and dependence for the following weekend. So if Sunday was the last dose, take naltrexone Wednesday and Thursday for a Friday dose.

I think with these guidelines I can go back to safe use once again. What do you guys think?",1505776551.0

He's also a close relative of grand pappy Morphine and cousin Heroin, but he's the black sheep of the family... Back in the day, pappy Morphine was really popular soldier, but he got into a bunch of trouble in his middle age. He had a daughter, whom he named Dia or Heroin.  

Dia ended up becoming world famous. Traveling the world, becoming one of the greatest artists this world has ever seen. She has collaborated with many rock stars and even some rappers. You can hear her in a lot of music. But in thd 1970's she became a pariah. Everyone loved her, except for the government. They went so far as to arrest anyone that met her or hung out with her regularly. Now she is an underground legend and more popular than ever.  

Dia at one point had a test tube baby in the 1930's with Codeine. No one really knew about her baby for a couple of decades, but by the 1950's he tried to make his debut in a two piece group aptly named ""Oxycodone and Acetaminophen"". Sometimes he would make appearances by himself, but largely he played as a two piece group with not only Ace, but also Oxy-Ibu, Oxy-Aspirin.   

But in the 1990's, Oxy was growing restless. He wanted to be as famous and popular as his mother. So in the early 1990's he hired the talent agency Purdue. What he got was a complete revamping of his image AND all the attention was finally on him alone. He alone would bring the Opiate family the attention and greatness that they deserved. He would become their icon and their protagonist.  

Meanwhile, Codeine was growing tired of being seen as a weak useless bum. He wasn't very popular amongst people, sure he had many friends. He didn't want to be famous, just well liked by most and beloved by a few. Most importantly, he wanted to feel useful. So he tool some steroids and enhanced his looks and performance skills. He became known as Hydrocodone. At first he wasn't too popular, but he got what he wanted. He was beloved by few, and was useful for a lot of people. He wasn't aware of what was right around the corner, a change was a coming, something that would be the beginning of a great life.  
----_-----
Part Two:  

Part Two  
Hydrocodone, or Hydro, as codeine has began to be known as, finally started to become respected among peers in his community. Not only was he popular amongst his peers, but he also felt needed. Anytime someone had an issue, Doctors recommended that their patients use Hydro to deal with the pain they were experiencing. Soon, Hydro was no longer a black sheep, but a full fledged member of the Opiate family, ever so popular at the family reunions. He was enjoying a success that not many in his family had known for a very long time. 


While geeked out of his mind, Hydro had sex with an unidentified coke whore for a week straight. 9 months later, sometime in the 1980's Hydro came home to find a basket on his front porch. Inside was a baby. Since he didn't know who the mother was, he named the baby Hydro, Hydromorphone. In school everyone started calling him Dilaudid. It's still not known how this name came to be, but it stuck and today many people know him as Dilly.   


Unbeknownst to the family, Oxy was devising a plan of his own to usurp not only Hydro, but also Dia as the most popular member of the family. Up until 1995, Oxy was relied upon for offering a quick fix, but he wasn't very popular, for the image he had was one of reckless partying and just being a hooligan. But hiring Purdue to handle his image would soon prove to be the greatest move in showbiz history. He would become the King of Pharmacueticals.  


""OC tha Don"" aka OxyContin broke out onto the scene in 1995. At first things were slow and not many people knew that OC tha Don, was indeed the don. But one day, OC told the secret to one of his fans. ""Okay bro, if you crush me, you will see that I am better than my sister. She is a fucking cunt bro, I am far more fun. Just crush me up and snort me""...  


Soon Purdue upped the stakes and started promoting Oxy even more. Under his new moniker of OxyContin, they even got the government involved to push his new brand even further. Dia had known a short period as being safer and less raucous than her father Morphine, her party girl/rockstar persona lasted far longer. Oxy however was known as the good son, who wouldn't go down the same path as his mother. But oftentimes, behavior is a learned trait. No matter how much of an angel people appear to be, they always have a dark side. But for now, OC tha Don smiled, for now he was the star boy in the pain game. Even the government said he was safer than his mother, they put their stamp of approval on his new persona as OxyContin.  


Meanwhile the Hydro family, Father Hydro and new son Dillie were still enjoying the rise of Hydro's newest venture ""Vicodin and the Norco's"", making a slew of record's with Oxy's former band mate's (Ace, Ibu and Aspirin) he found great success. The whole Opiate family really were becoming a more successful, earlier version of the Kardashian's, but they had actual talent. Unfortunately, Dillie wasn't able to find anyone that wanted to make music with him. He released a ton of albums by himself ""2's"", ""4's"", and his most popular album that still sell's really well today, ""Mallinkrodt 8's"". But it would be years before people came to find out how valuable his record ""8's"" were.  

Part Three
Oxy soon exploded. The governments approval of his OxyContin brand lead to an explosion in how often he was referred. Everyone was getting to know him. Soon even his smaller albums were being bought by people with everything from sprained ankles to broken toes. People started going to the equivalent of the city's corner store or bodega, the ""pill mill"". For a good 15 years Oxy was the King of Pharmaceutical Pop. He made the label heads at Purdue billions, he was the most popular artist ever.  


Meanwhile, the Opiate family enjoyed a great boost to what was soon becoming a burgeoning empire. Even far before pappy Morphine, the family had a long history in ancient time's with maw Opium and her children Laudanum and Tinctures. The family always wanted boys, but pappy Morphine would be the first boy in the long line of girl's in a family. When maw Opium finally had her boy Morphine, that was the day that the family finally felt great happiness. In a Chinese family (maw Opium came from a long line of Chinese Dynasty) the first born boy is always coveted above all else. Paw Morphine would become the standard that the rest of the Opium children would be compared to. For a time his daughter was the standard until the whole world turned against her in the 1930's, but that is a story for another day.  


Oxy was a lot like his paw paw and less like his mother Dia, for she could be draining and the joy that was found with her company could be short lived. Oxy was far more energizing than anyone in his family. He was born to be a rockstar and his mother knew it. She taught him everything she knew, which of course she learned from her father, but try as she may, she did not want to be like her father. For he became a pariah, sadly the apple does not fall far from the tree. The public saw her to be worse than her father, seen as a total scourge to society, a complete and utter pariah in every sense of the word she became. She wanted Oxy to have the life that she would never have. Sure, she was popular, but she would never know the life of success that her father had, she had to resort to working with nefarious members of the criminal underworld. Never did she want her son to have to deal with that life, but no matter how hard people try, they will eventually have to deal with that life at one point or another, especially if they come upon riches the likes of which the common man can only dream of. The criminal underworld has a way of latching on to whatever is most lucrative.  


Soon the underworld learned they could set up their own legitimate distribution networks to peddle the whole family. Legitimate doctors were soon pushing the whole family en masse to the public as fast as they could buy. The pill mill era was born.

I have a suboxone doctor, Dr Alpha. He prescribes me 30x 8mg/2mg Suboxone with 1 refill every two months. 

I went to a new doctor, Dr Beta, with the intention of switching to her but we didn't jibe well unfortunately. This doctor wanted to take me off my benzo which would greatly reduce my quality of life. 

She prescribed me 14x 8mg/2mg Suboxone (a two week supply). But I still had a one week left until my refill from Dr Alpha plus the refill. (I told her I ran out of my Suboxone about 7 days early because I've been taking too much. I feel it doesn't work as well as it used to. I've been on 8mg per day for about 5 years now. I feel like it wears off at about 16 hours and I wake up feeling kind of sick. But this is all beside the point.) 

The pharmacy filled the prescription from Dr Beta successfully. My insurance paid for it and it was ready to pick up. However I found some Suboxone on the black market to tide me over until refill day, which is today. 

This morning I went to the pharmacy and told the pharmacist I didn't want the Suboxone that Dr Beta prescribed because I wasn't going back to her and I just wanted the refill from Dr Alpha, which is what I got. The pharmacist cancelled the prescription from Dr Beta. 

I want to know: Will Dr Alpha see that I got this prescription from Dr Beta when he looks up my file in the prescription database?

 I am fairly confident I can explain to Dr Alpha that I wanted to try a new Doctor but decided to stay with him for whatever reason. However i would much rather not have to explain anything to him. 

I'm in New York City if it matters. 

Does anyone know if a cancelled C3 prescription that was never picked up will show up in your prescription database file??

       I've been teaching myself a little python recently for the purpose of making Twitter bots.
 I've done some cool ones so far, and Ive just started a new project. 

The Early Warning Bot 
Croud Sourced Fentanyl Contamination Locator 

      I am making a bot that scans the posts in this forum for associated keywords (eg: fentanyl, and warning).  Then searching the positive posts titles and text against a US states, cities and counties library. The bot will then post a warning of misrepresented fentanyl, and the combined matches of the location check. 

      This forum is probably in many cases the earliest warning of contamination, especially in the case of nonfatal experiences that did not require hospitalization. We are all on the front lines, a hot shot is a real possibility we all risk, every time one of us picks up dope. Our combined risk could potentially prevent someoned death. 

      I started this project recently after being unable to save a friend who was ODing on fent, Narcan was useless, and cpr wasn't enough to save her. A warning might save someone else from the same fate; and it's a good distraction for my mind.

Recently moved overseas to a NO tolerance country. You have 2 beers at dinner and you are an alcoholic. It's lame and I have an addiction problem. I'm what I would consider a binger. I save up my money and buy a large dose, only to be out in a few days and the withdrawals are easy. 
 Now being somewhere new puts me in a little a little situation. I know no connects at all. I literally sit on a bench or walk around profiling everyone I pass.  Prescribed narcotics are rarely given, especially if you are from America. Guess our rap isn't that good haha. 
So I thing about getting high constantly, wishing I would get some mystery disease or kicked by a horse, now that I am working in the equestrian line of work. Both have happened and I finally had a doc give me oxy er.... sigh. Enough to get me high once. So I turn to the lovely internet. I do my research and find in the next country over, they are very open to drugs, but it is illegal. They even have a little bit of the city sectioned off for marijuana consumption. so I decide this is the best place to start. 
I make up a shit story. I'm a closet user and even being married for 3 years, my husband is clueless. That story is for another ttime. I drive 50 km to the closest city and jump on a train. Drive the train over the boarder, and I'm in the land of a little bit freer! 
I take of walking to ""marijuana town"" to start getting info. Now in this little town, you don't even mention hard drugs. You are literally shunned. I have a few drinks and start using my gift of gab. After a few people leave me hanging, I dusky get a few details. I must go to the ""bad part of town"". Everyone advises me it isn't safe and I assure them this isn't my first rodeo. I was blessed to live in Juarez for  a year and had little quarrels other than a few things being stole.
Now a little side story. I'm not your typical drug user. I'm highly educated and well spoken. Curiosity got the best of me 5 years ago, which I don't regret, but helped fill my depressive needs at the time.... and still does. I've lost a lot and have gotten so lost in my lies, that I openly accepted getting the fuck outta dodge. I'm very cute, yeah yeah yeah. White, blond, blue eyes, in my 30's female. I know the game and started on crystal when I was 15. Done it all since then. I make ""friends""very easy and drugs have taken me many places.
So back to where I was going...i know that they have a drug consumption room in this city. It is located in the bad part of town. I get the name and take of aha. Grab some beers for the walk. I finally get to my destination, but am weary. I don't have anything, and the police station is across the street. Fun characters out front. I don't fit in.  I scan my location sms begin profiling. I walk around the block and pass a food bank with a rough crowd out front. I walk by a few times, taking sips of my beer and take a smoke. Do a little pep talking and proceed. 
I walk through the stony corridor and find myself in an open layout with picnic tables around, easily 100 eyes on me. Mostly men ranging around 40. I breath in and, as expected, the heckling begins.  I look for the most crowded, heckling table and make my way over, sitting down as if me and these guys go way back. 
I'm immediately greeted in English with, ""what are you looking for?"" My language on so many levels .I say 3gs, boom batta Bing in my hand, and I figure I might as well finish my beer. No waiting game necessary.  I start making conversation, and to no surprise, buy some powder and make friends. One guy suggests going to the dcr to smoke.i say I will accompany, only to get gear. 
I walk into this very modern building to be greeted by friendly staff. Behind them is rooms made of class, occupied by those smoking rock and dope. Me and my new friend reserve a room. I give them a fake name and wait in amazement at what is going on. People of all colours, mostly on the lower economic end, freely smoking and getting high in these rooms.  People passed out in corners or going on rants like it's nbd. the staff and users are not phased, and continue about their business. 
Soon I find myself in a room with my new buddy, rocking up our stash, and off to smoking and this shit was tits! I normally don't like uppers, but this hit the spot. People coming in and out of our cubicle to smoke and borrow little things. Everyone knows one another. We crack open beers and continue to bullshit until ourhour is up. 
My friend says lets go, but I remind him I only came for gear.  He says well get some. I say I need to go to the injection room. He says don't bother and points to two large tubs sitting on a table in the hallway.  I walk over, passing junkies sleeping quietly on state of the art furniture and others gathered around the coffee pot, trying to act like I've done this plenty of times before. 
I look into the bins and hello! Rigs and everything a dope user could ask for, minus the drugs. All for my taking. I ask a worker if its okay to take a few.  Take as much as you need they say.  Thank you jj. No more raiding doctors offices or using old rigs. I fill my bag like the glutton I am, with no one stopping me. Everything was just my size!!!
I leave, very pleased with my score for the day. New friends, easy hook, and a place to do it.  Since then I've been back every 3 weeks on the dot. People now recognize me and come to me. I've made friends and we all get together to smoke and rant over beers and rock. I don't fit in visually, but for those few hours I get to live out as my alter ego and get the next few days to melt my brain. It works for the time being. I enjoy that the access isn't as easy, being it takes 3 hours there and back, but it's almost like Cheers. There when I need it. 
Sorry for the bad grammar.  Happy highs

FUCKING HOLY RAMBLY POST
TLDR; chilling high like any other night when a cute whittle black kitten was crying at me. I obviously drop everything I'm doing to find it, to feed it, and possibly bring it in to safety if it will allow me. Upon trying to help we discovered the kitten was dragging both back legs as though it had been hit by a car. We brought it inside until we figure out what to do with it, might keep it, might take it to a vets office for them to help and adopt out. However I keep feeling as though this cat was in my yard squawking at me for a reason in a possibly vein attempt to convince myself bringing another cat into my family is acceptable.

MORNINGEDIT: After spending the night with her and getting a feel for her mannerisms I have grown even fonder of the little cutie pie. We have decided to keep her as of now, she will be going to the vet later this week to see if there is even anything they can really do for her other than the age old 'time heals all wounds' spiel. She trusts us and is allowing us to help her while she kicks back and sleeps for the time being once we realised she trusted us is when we came to the conclusion we were going to keep her. Of course this could change at any moment if any of my current assholes try to hurt her or something else unfavourable happens. I'm taking on helping this baby recover at the worst time of my life emotionally because I am still absolutely certain this kitten came to me for a reason and she has already cheered me up. Already helping each other! 

This place is animal loving just as much as it is drug loving it seems so I feel like sharing my story with y'all about how a girl named Berry made a new friend name Casper. 

We all know I already have a zoo of animals, kittens out the ass and two dogs so I'm well trained in the art of animal companionship. 

Last night my mother had heard little cries coming from just outside our fence and swore there was a kitten. I didn't see it, but I didn't judge her for leaving a little trail of food for this supposed kitten. 

Boom flash forward to tonight I'm on my front porch all alone trying to wind down from the shitstorm that was my day when I kept hearing a loud cat meowing. I started looking around frantically because I knew for a fact that cry did not belong to any of my cats, so I was excited to see the kitten my mom had seen the night before. I didn't have to look far, sitting at the very bottom step of my front porch was the littlest all black kitten with the mightiest cry I'd ever heard. Of course I tried to reach down and pet it but it was to scared for all that noise. I ran in and told my mom the kitten was back as I hurried through the house gathering up a bowl and food. Once I got back outside the kitten was gone, but I wasn't giving up that easy after I'd seen how little it was. I'd say 6-8 weeks old. 

I managed to get it to talk back to me enough for me to pinpoint it's location inside one of my front bushes. Get over there and probably just as soon as I did the little bugger dashed to the heavily bushy/tree area beside my garage. Okay, fine I will stop chasing you little cutiepie as I don't want to scare you off again like last night apparently. I calmly place a pile of food down on my patio next to the kittens hiding spot hoping if anything it would at least eat and I could chalk it up as doing a good deed tonight. 

But, then I noticed something else about the kitten who had crept out to eat but ran back into hiding just as soon as my mom came out and startled it. My new little yard fritter was injured, and my urge to help skyrocketed. I pointed it out to my mother that the little baby seemed to have been dragging it's back leg as though it had been hit by a car. Which worried me and only made me want to catch the baby even more just to make sure she was okay. 

It is a female, and we are calling it Casper so that should make this storytelling a little easier. 

I walked back inside to get a water bowl and do other human stuffs while my mom stayed outside keeping watch if Casper decided to grace us with her presence again. She did of course, she was engaging in a lovely game of cat and mouse at this point. However it was my mother's turn to inform that little Casper is indeed hurt like I suspected but dragging both back legs behind her and only using her front ones as if she was hit by a car or possibly paralyzed and that's why such a little baby is wondering around such dangerous territory alone. 

Knowing now she is hurt, and quite possibly bad we changed our hunting methods. I wondered back inside to tend to my actual for sure animals at this point while my mother decided to lay outside beside the pile of food and water while trying to coax Casper out the whole time. About 10 minutes later my mom is on my front porch holding the even smaller than realised precious kitten in a delicate manner as to not worsen her injuries.  

In a quick fluid motion we snuck her past both of my dogs without them catching wind, nor did my other kitties except one who saw the luring of the kitten happen from the safety of her window perch. At first she wanted to see but quickly gave up interest. We hustled her into the bathroom which is the only room in the house not occupied by any other animals as I certainly don't want them mingling until I get the all clear about diseases from a vet. However, I wasn't going to leave a seemingly badly injured kitten to fend for herself outside another night when I can help her. 

We got her all cosy with a bed, food, water, and even a little toy in her new castle for the time being. Once we got her inside y'all I expected a frantic wild child. Not even close, this cat has stole my heart with her love. Despite her injuries and struggle of getting around this little kitty hasn't stopped purring or loving on us since we set her down in the safety of our house. 

I am not sure what we are going to do with her at this moment in time, we both want to keep her obviously but I am worried about her injuries first. We caught her pretty late so I won't know anything until later today. Probably much later today unfortunately. But I have sent out the word to friends who work at vets to see if any of their vets have room and be willing to take on another rescue in need. Our shelters here are always over their cat limit so I hope one of my friends can help. 

If not, I guess I go out into the country and dump her on the side of the road. She should be ight, right?! 
/s

Like I mentioned we would like to keep her, I think she is a good omen with all the shit I've been dealing with lately only to be greeted by a sweet little angel? An injured one at that who is full of nothing but love? Almost as if she was placed in my yard to show me even through great challenges and hardships one isn't required to lose their loving spirit. I'm not religious whatsoever, I do however believe everything does happen for a reason and this kitten screaming at me tonight is no exception.

Obviously if we decide to keep her it will be an uphill battle and not always pretty. However, I keep telling myself she picked us maybe we should do right by her and pick her?! 

Like I said, we'll know more later and figure it all out then. If I do decide to keep her she will be going to the vet to get checked out don't worry about that part I won't just 'adopt' her and make her rot on my bathroom floor until she magically heals. She deserves the best chance at life and if upon research I find out I am capable of giving her what she needs now and possibly in the future it is safe to say then I am a mommy again! What's one more, right? Famous last words. 

I will be doing what is needed of to figure out her best path in life, recovering peacefully at home with her new mommy, and siblings or healing in a cage hoping one day to find a loving family. 

It's not set in stone, and I'm just a fuck up druggie, but for right now all I know is I have a new member of my family who needs a little extra attention and goes by the name Casper. üòÅüòÅüòÅ

She is safe right now, and that is my main concern for now. 

If you read this far what do you guys think I should do? Keep in mind absolutely none of my animals now are mistreated or neglected in any way shape or form and even get to visit the vet when needed. They also eat before I eat but with how much litter they go through I'm going to start reconsidering that motto. üòáüòáüòÅüòÅ

Okay. I need to go find more boy to come down, even though I'm riding that 'there's a wittle baby kitty beside me' wave too. This week a new kitten, maybe next week a new puppy? 

TELL ME HOW STUPID I AM REDDIT. I'M A FUCK UP WHO SHOULD ONLY HAVE A GOLDFISH. 

Okay yeah, gonna enjoy being high a bit more while I cuddle with Casper and snap endless pictures of her.

She was obviously a heroin addict and was apparently experiencing some pretty intense withdrawals. She was sitting on the curb and rocking back and forth while sobbing. As I approached her, we made eye contact. She must have thought that I was someone who would lecture her about the dangers of heroin addiction, most likely due to my being dressed in business professional attire. When I asked how she was doing, she didn't reply. I then asked ""are you sick""? ""Yeah"", she replied. ""Looking to get well?"" I asked in a low voice. That question quickly piqued her interest, as her eyes lit up and her head popped up. She shook her head in a yes motion rigorously. ""Here's $30 bucks, go get well"" I say to her, handing her the cash. She gives me the look one would give the Lord Jesus Christ himself upon arriving at the gates of heaven. I give her a wink and walk off quickly due to my bus arriving. Funny thing is, I've never even done dope (or any other hard drugs) a day in my life. I simply read about how shitty withdrawals are from the people on r/opiates and thought of how I had the power to change that for someone. Though I sometimes feel morally opposed to enabling someone's addiction (especially with all the Carfentanyl floating around in my city), I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment knowing that I would make someone from this awesome community proud.

Now that I got that out of the way. I haven't taken any opiates in months and I was able to take the whole Oxycontin 40 mg pill with no problems ,except for an upset stomach.I took it the way it was intended ,I actually take them for pain ,I have spinal stenosis,a bulging disk and sciatica ,not to get high.I can't get any opiates prescribed too me any more because of all of the junky motherfuckers out there doing them to get high and the government scared the doctors into not prescribing them anymore. I do not recommend you snort it or shoot it ,if you are doing that,then you are addicted and need some serious help.
I am writing this because there are people out there that maybe have an OC 40 and may be frightened into taking the whole thing.I am here to say ,you can take the whole thing ,if you take it as prescribed.Now ,if you are still too frightened to take it ,then give it away or throw it away , or if you can ,barter with someone and see if you can maybe get two 20 mg ones and take one of them instead. If you do decide to take the whole thing ,you should be fine. I know everyone is different as far as body weight and height and metabolism might affect it differently.I am 150 lbs ,5 ft 8 in tall   with a fast metabolism and I am ok. Besides the upset stomach I am just a bit itchy and my eyes are pinned ,that is normal for taking opiates.Now if you do not have a tolerance for opiates ,or even if you do, and you take it some other way ,such as snorting it or injecting then there is a possibility you can die ,because then it is all released at once.If you want my advice take the Oxy  the way it is prescribed ,why play with your life.

Dont get me wrong - i LOVE the high from oxy, it is without a doubt the most euphoric opiate i have tried. But the tolerance problem and the high price for the drug makes it not worth it. Another thing that bothers me with oxy is that after i dose i'll get the euphoria that lasts anywhere from 45 min to 1,5 hour. But about 3 - 3,5 hour after my dose i'm leaved in a condition where i feel bored with everything. I also have a disease/condition called ""hyperthyrodism"" that includes a metabolism that is way too high and therefor drugs also leaves my body very fast. So that could be a explanation.
Does anybody know what the half life of oxy is for a ""normal"" person?
Can anyone relate to these things i experience?

First a little back story: I'm not a hardcore opiate user by any means, but if I come up on some painkillers I'll take em. I'm aware of the slippery slope this is for a lot of people. I guess I'm one of the lucky few, I've been able to maintain this casual relationship in my 15ish years of using drugs.
So here's the question. I picked up some of those little pink 10mg oxycodone and I've noticed about 30 mins after I swallow one, I get like a feeling of fullness/ringing in my ears which is very similar to the ""bell ringer"" you get after a great big busto from the crack pipe. It's not something I'm particularly worried about, just never experienced it before and wondered if anyone knows what it is and if there's a name for it.

I realize it is hard to tell from pics but it'd be appreciated if anyone could provide insight. 

https://imgur.com/a/ZrymB

They look real to me (but I've never had the 48 12s before). They break up the same way other 30s break up. The drip also tastes on. There are two reasons I think they might be fake though: 

1.) twice in the past few days (out of probably 10 doses), I've nodded off when taking my usual oxy dose. I rarely ever nod on oxy. Instead I usually get an energetic buzz off of oxy. 

2.) yesterday, I was able to poop about 20 mins after dosing. I usually am so constipated on oxy that I don't poop when I am high. 

P.S. how come I can't zoom in and get the same level of detail as other posters? I have an iPhone8 which makes me think it is not a hardware issue. 

Thanks
