ae0r69,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/ae0r69/a_home/,7,https://redd.it/ae0r69,Waiting_on_a_Corner,A Home.,"""Well I'm from California I moved here about 6 months ago in January"" I said clearly. I sat upright with my chest puffed to seem confidant in the small entry area of The Best Pest Control. Travis the owner sat across from me in his office chair asking me questions on my background as part of my interview to be a ""The Best Pest Control Technician"". I already knew I had the position, small mom and pop business like this need to replace someone fast when they leave otherwise work backs up and they go under. But I had another advantage, I was raised Mormon and went to church most sundays. Travis was a good Mormon father and hired the office manager Tayler from his old congregation. The Mormon connection, as cheesy as it is, came through for me. After Travis decided I must be a good person, I am a Mormon after all, we shook hands and I started Monday.


This was how I came to meet and live with Adin. Adin was the office assistant, he did anything he was told by Travis and Taylor. I had seen him at church a couple times, clean cut, well styled hair, he looked like a good young man. Though looks were deceiving Adin enjoyed getting high, partying, and drinking, he wore the mask. His secret reflected mine, I also dabbled in debauchery. I had been a regular at the Bullpin, pounding four dollar pints of Red Oak between turns playing pool with Jacob and Lucas, every Thursday for 4 months now. Most Saturdays when I told my parents that I was out with my Mormon friends I was at parties. I had friends at work from the ""ghetto"" city next to ours where I stuck out from everyone with my California style. Flip flops, jeans, a tank top, and perfectly styled hair, that was my statement every summer night since I had moved. But in the ""ghetto"" crowd I was the only white guy at parties, drinking Reds, and finding the stoners and druggies. Hoping to trade decent beer for a hit or two of whatever they had. I tested Adin casually by mentioning getting drunk and stoned at a party. He wasn't fazed, and spoke about getting stoned out of earshot of everyone else. Soon Adin, Lucas, and I were all partying.

This was exactly the opposite of the intentions I had when I first landed across the nation from all my old problems. I moved here with a tentative verbal agreement with my parents. The agreement was I got to live there for one year, paying 200 dollars a month, if I stayed clean of drugs and went to church every Sunday. As simple as that. I was already past every minute withdrawal from the alcohol and smoking an ounce a week, when I stepped off the plane. So why was I on the roof of a beer garden downtown ""sobering up"" with Lucas? I pondered this briefly, staring at a vile wheat IPA Lucas picked that sat in front of me. Lucas had bummed a single cigarette from some girls on the street, lifting it from him was a bit of a dick move, 'eh,we're best friends'. Lucas was droning on about how drunk he was, trying to think of how to get us back to his parents. He scheemed as I lit the cigarette and pulled in a lungfull of tar, nicotine, and sweet MAOI's. Mmmmmmmm...... That's why people do this, I hit it again and handed it to him. He accepts it, not even noticing I stole it, I shrug and chug down half of my disgusting drink. 

""Fuck, we're fucked"" Lucas exhaled.

""Dude I was already fucked, I have to move in a month"" I said monotone and hopeless. ""My parents said I could stay till January, then I'm on my own for good"" I pounded the last of the beer and took the cigarette back.

Lucas looked at me shocked I hadn't mentioned this to him earlier. Though quickly his face changed to mischief. Mischief and fun were what Lucas was best at, always pushing shots, double strength drinks, always trying to make every night amazing. Slowly he took back the last of the cigarette and said ""You know Adin has been looking to move out, plus he's the office manager now...""


On Saturday Adin wanted some weed and I had a dealer, from my Algebra 102 class. Allen was chill, he sold weed so he and his girlfriend could smoke for free and that's all he wanted. He was nice and even had Brooke and I over for a movie night once. He wasn't looking for new clients but we were algebra friends, so I bought Adin along. We bought a quarter and they seemed to get along. It was a smooth transaction, in the car Adin packed his orange spoon and I divided the bag. We smoked on our way to take Adin back to his dad's truck. Adin looked at me as we turned on to the freeway ""we should be roommates"" he said. I laughed as I hit the bowl steering with my knee ""sure"" I said. It started as a stoned joke but after one mostly sober talk, 2 apartment visits, and some paperwork, Adin and I were roommates. 

We uses his dad's truck to get beds and move our four boxes of stuff. My mom found us four couches on Facebook and lamps came from Goodwill. It was bare bones bachelor living. Travis loaned us his projector and we proped it up on my longboard, it was gigantic on the wall. Adin supplied an XBOX and my grandma stocked our kitchen with cups and plates. We had heat, light, beds, and drugs. Lucas and his girlfriend set up the Wi-Fi while we were gone,  electromagnetic radiation broadcast out ""BrosB4Hoes"" from the living room, classy... 

We loved it, we had total freedom and we used it liberally. We threw a Spartan party the very first night we were there, Everclear lemonade flowed and weed smoke bellowed from the back porch with a loveseat on it. What would become my core group of friends sat there playing Red, Purple, Black. To my left was Lucas and his loving girlfriend Mira, as Kelsey. I had known Kelsey for a long time through church, and Brooke liked her. Adin and his new office assistant Val sat across from me, and leaning on me was my girlfriend Brooke. We laughed, got very drunk, and had a blast. In the end Val and Adin slept in his room and Brooke and I went in mine. From then on everyone came over just to blow off steam, it was a home and haven for us and our friends. We never had a dull night in our house.

 Brooke was 18 she was young and impressionable but, she had a will of iron and made things happen. I needed this because I had never had such adult responsibilities and was intimidated. That was not why we were together though., she cast a beautiful spell 
over me, we loved each other intensely, we had fought for it and won, we were invincible. I drowned into her beauty, 5'4"", Blonde shoulderblade length hair curled framing her fair round face, sea blue eyes, perfect Nordic beauty. An hour later she lay on my chest, I always synchronized my breathing to hers. She melted into blissfull sleep, carefully I reached to my right and hoped I had a roach on the table. My fingers found a
 crutch, paydirt, I put it in my mouth with my right hand and the grab a lighter. I look at it, about a centimeter of weed is visible.

'good enough'

I lit it expertly while stroking Brookes back to keep her asleep. Three hits later I taste paper and I chrush out the crutch on the nightstand. Rolling to the left I faced Brooke our legs intertwine. I tried to study her face, memorizing every curve and dimple. For the last week whenever I closed my eyes for bed I saw a silhouette of a girl. I had wracked my brain time and again but nobody I knew could match the silhouette, and it most definitely wasn't Brooke. I close my eyes and there she was again like the ghost of Christmas future. She sat staring at me, waiting for the minutes on her lilac mermaid timer to reach zero. I am paralyzed as the figure walks to me, she slowly strokes my face, ""turn before the cannons"" she whispered and smirked.

I was released as my eyes snapped open to the same curves I was memorizing were staring back at my shocked face. I gingerly got out of bed sweating and went to the very top shelf in the bathroom, quietly I pulled out a small bag of Xanax bars and broke half off. Expertly put the rest back, not hidden, just placed where Brooke couldn't see. I slid back to Brookes side and curled up to her.

 I don't remember closing my eyes again that night.",1546992281.0

We experimented and I bought a box from him once.

Then later, I figured out how to use the DNM's and I began using drugs such as LSD, MDMA and ketamine. Later I bought my first oxy, and later some morphine and DHC.

I never thought it an opiate high was amazing like say MDMA. Many of the times I got high on opiates I didn't enjoy it because of uncomfortable side effects. However, I've always had this weird obsession with opiates.

One day, I bought heroin. Fucking heroin. I'd never thought I would, but I did. Luckily, I didn't smoke it properly and just wasted it so I didn't experience a high that could lead to addiction.

But, I still want to try it again. I know opiates could fuck up my life if I continue, but I have a huge urge to do it again. Or at least, some opiate.",1546988756.0

Yesterday I woke up with what I thought was the flu. I used some BTH and felt better, but my stomach is still giving me trouble and I’m still getting a lot of physical pain, aches and chills.

Now if I was in withdrawals, wouldn’t these symptoms go away almost immediately? While my symptoms have gone down I think it’s more just from being high I’m not noticing being sick. Any sure way to tell? I mean usually I can go about 4-5 days of smoking BTH without getting any hint of withdrawal, even then it’s a small episode and goes away within a couple hours.

Sorry if it sounds like a noob question, I’ve never gone through full blown withdrawals so I don’t know what it feels like. I usually just get dizzy, hot, and really anxious for a couple hours. Thanks for anyone who has any input lol",1546987104.0

Long story included.,"Ive been going to the same sub doctor for almost years now.  They are super cool as well as nice and genuinely care about the patients. Not only that but they only hire recovering addicts who have 2+ years clean. For over a year throughout my fiances pregnancy I stayed totally clean except for smoking a bit of bud. 

i had made the decision to quit my serving job at dennys and go back to car sales(which I consider my career and also love), but any of you who have ever been in car sales knows its drug infested. I did awesone for about 6 months. Kept to myself, had a daily routine of morning meditation, working out, and planning my day. 

Then we got a new salesman. He was around my age, had a false sense of self confidence and was great at talking to customers. His whole demeanor screamed adderall. This fucked came in and outsold me the first month. God my pride and my ego was destroyed. Here I am sober and on top of my game and Mr.Douche just comes in and takes over.

So I start to get a little bit closer to him and kind of hint about drug use and he pulls out this zip lock bag filled to the top with yellow schoolbusses(Xanax 2mg) and the pink circular pills(adderall, I forget what mg 30 I think?). Before I could even say no he had pulled a few of each out and handed them to me and down the hatch some went, and so the relapse began.

For a while it was great. Gave 0 fucks what I said to customers, had no filter, seemed to always say what they wanted to hear, and master manipulation which is what car sales is about for most people. I was unstoppable. Selling one a day at least which in this business would net you 8-10k a month at the right dealership. I was putting money back and life was good at the time.

Then came my downfall. One day out nowhere I scrolled through my contacts and ran across the all familiar (John R) in my phone. Which is what my dboy was always saved under. I clicked on his name, typed out that ever so familiar text ""you good?"" and stared at it for about a minute. Sent... Now I feel like its important to mention here my complete lack of self control when it comes to H. I cannot conserve, I can't say no, I can't limit myself, and I don't know when to quit.

Within a month I went from salesman of the month to salesman of the bathroom 4-5 times throughout the day. I stopped my healthy morning routines and replaced them with morning shots. I stopped caring about my appearance. I stopped coming home with flowers, steak dinners and presents for my baby girl and started coming home with 8 balls, tv dinners, and track marks.

Life quickly fell apart again. This has all happened several times before. Seems to be a routine for me. It falls apart quicker and quicker each time. I blew through my savings in 2 months, had a gram + a day habit and a terrible attitude and depression that carried on from the moment I opened my eyes in the morning to the time I closed them at night.

I had previously worked my way up to monthly take homes at my doctor which was awesome so I only had to clean up for about 3 days a month to clean my system out for my appt and drug test. Well I pissed dirty and the look on my docs face when I walked into his office and he looked at my results. It was almost like a father being disappointed in a son. I lost my monthly and got brought back down to weekly. I lost their respect and also their trust.

That brings me to today. 5 months later. I lost my job, my car blew up on me, I am broke most of the time, ive got a crippling daily habit, and life is just all around shit right now. I am about to go piss dirty again for like the 20th time in a row. I'm surprised they still let me come but they haven't given up on me yet. Not to mention that its an all day affair because I have to take 3 different busses, an uber, and be at the doc for about 3 hours. Then make the trip back home.

Sorry for the long post. I just wanted to give you all something to read for those of you who are bored or like reading stories about people failing in life lol. I have a ton of funny/crazy stories about my car sales jobs over the last 5 years if anyone would be interested in reading about them. Let me know. Hope everyone is well today and either nodding or staying strong in sobriety. I respect all of you. Much love.

First time user of Xanax and Oxycodone.,"Ok guys. I had a wild night and things went out of control quickly. I had my girlfriends house all by myself because she was out with her family. I had absolutely nothing to do and just randomly searched her bathroom cabinet. I found some xanax and other pills and I thought I could try it out.

I already knew what Xanax was but I also found some Oxycodone and I was interested in trying and just having a good time. I took 1mg of Xanax and I didn't really like the effects to much. Didn't get me high or anything so after 3 hours I took 25mg of Oxycodone 12 hour release. I then snorted 10mg after 2 hours. It felt really great and I just sat in my bed trying to masturbate and it I noticed that it was impossible to have an orgasm. I then had trouble being awake and I drifted off in and out of consciousness (Nodding?) I also noticed that it became a little harder to breath, but I was still able to breath somewhat fine, it was just a bit slower.

I decided to drink 2 cups of coffee and playing some video games until I was able to breath better and go to sleep without worrying about not breathing in my sleep. After a couple of hours I felt more awake but still very tired and went to bed. Woke up 9 hours later completely fine. I remember everything so I didn't have a black out.

I know this was incredibly stupid off me I have no tolerance for both of these drugs and I guess that the 1mg xanax really messed my logical thinking. I now wonder if this was an overdose? And are you supposed to go in and out of consciousness when taking Oxy? Did I do any damage to my brain?

My mother had died after being ill for a long time, leaving behind an abundance of untouched morphine and oxycodone (not to mention a grieving wreck of a daughter). 

Early Monday morning I underwent invasive surgery (double jaw + 3 wisdom teeth removed) which left me in profuse pain. I’ve since been loaded up on oxycodone, tramadol, and morphine. I assumed my tolerance would be back to nothing by now but that is not the case. I’ve needed an obscene amount just to touch the pain, to the point where my doctor said most people would be well and truly unconscious on the amount I was given. 

At first the pain was too overbearing to even notice the effects of the drugs, but now it’s under control and I can really appreciate the high. I’ve been in such a good mood all day despite the ordeal I just went through- chatting and laughing with the nurses (I’m usually an anxious introverted worry wart) and having great dialogue with my family and friends. The one and only downside is that my face is itching like mad but I can’t gain relief from scratching due to numbness. It’s a lot more infuriating than it sounds. 

I’m heading home in the morning and they won’t be discharging me with any opiates, unless you count panadeine forte (lol). 
It was fun while it lasted I guess. I don’t have the money or resources to continue with opiates anymore, nor the desire for my life to head back in that direction. But god was this a reminder of what I lost when I quit them. The pull is strong. 

Stay safe everyone.

Probably a shit post. Apologies in advance.,"I'm coming up on 2 years since I last used. I've been on methadone (tried subs and just wasn't for me) during that time and stabilized at a pretty high dose and have been titrating down since. I'm around 50mg now.

Normally I'm the one on this sub cheering everyone on in their recovery and telling them how great they're doing and that the bad times will pass and just hang in there. But, I can't seem to convince myself of that.

A couple of months ago I had to get blood drawn for some tests and I think that triggered my needle fixation in my brain because ever since then I can't stop thinking about using. I dream about it every single night and nothing feels right anymore. I tried for 2 years to get my life back to 'normal' but the sad truth is it will never go back since I, like many of you, only ever felt normal when I was using.

I know it's stupid, I know the chances are slim to none, I know exactly what I would tell someone else if they were asking this question, but has anyone ever planned out a short relapse and then continued on in their recovery?

I just want some relief from this cliché monkey on my back. I was thinking of using for a week and then hopping back on the wagon. It would fuck up my reputation with my doc and I would lose a take-home or two but I just don't know how else to shake this feeling. I miss the sweet nothingness so much. I miss the magic numbing of emotional pain so much. Fentanyl was my best friend for so long and heroin was a pretty decent runner up. Anyway. Watchy'all think? Pretty fucking stupid, right? Or has anyone managed this successfully before?

Sorry for the novel-length post. Hope everyone else is safe and well and having a great 2019.

&#x200B;

I remember the first time I smoked weed on opiates I had some codeine phosphate 60mg and went to a KFC drivethrough to get a boneless banquet and took 300mg as I was waiting. I rolled a phat 1g blunt while waiting aswell. So when I get home I feel it somewhat but I have never gotten why people loved the effects of opiates with some use in the past. Then I smoke this joint and very quickly it seems to intensify the codeine 10 fold and vice versa. Then I get upstairs put some trippy music on and am am scared to close my eyes because my breathing feels manual and I dont wanna just die right there and then because I read people stop breathing on overdoses because well theyre overdosing. I eventually give in and shut my eyes and am amazed by the pshychedlic closed eye visuals but at this point I am nodding to the max. Honestly opiates are no fun without weed for me. After that experience that combo was the only thing I could think about for a month till I did it again, like I dont know why I waited so long for something that felt so good. Anyone else feel same or just me

I've been on 200-300mg of oxy a day for the past couple months or so. The plan is to finish what I have tonight, tomorrow I'll begin trying to find some comfort in the few different strains of Kratom I've picked up, small doses of loperamide, muscle relaxers (Flexeril) if I need it and Xanax (for sleep), plus the usual household medicines. Then when I wake up the following day on Wednesday I'll assess how I am and potentially wait till a little later in the morning/early afternoon before I begin trying to induct onto Suboxone with small doses first, to hopefully avoid precipitated withdrawal. And from there I'll try to keep my use of subs to 10 days or so to avoid dependency on it and try to rapidly taper off them, and use Kratom for any issues coming off it.

&#x200B;

The worst part is sitting here feeling completely fine, knowing what I'll be feeling tomorrow is anything but. I can just only hope my plan will work decently and make it a lot more comfortable. I'm just lucky I'll be able to take a few days off work without any issue.

when we *nicely* asked for the rest of the payment he claimed he couldn’t do it right now because he was “broke”. that’s been the story for the past week; he’s too broke to pay us cash, he can’t afford to front us, he can’t afford to throw us .4 to split to pay us for babysitting, etc. We’ve been struggling to stay well without resorting to stealing or panhandling or something. 

tonight we came through to get my bf a point (im having to go on suboxone for a few days because we cant afford to keep both of us well) and this motherfucker wouldn’t even look at us. he took the 20, weighed out the piece, handed it back, and wouldn’t answer any of our “how are you?” “how’s the new puppy?” type questions. didn’t say bye back to us or anything. oh, also he has FOUR new Louis Vuitton collars for his new dog and multiple gucci boxes everywhere. but he can’t pay us back? his loyal customers who fund his fucking lifestyle?

Ive only done it with 3 of those 5. 1 is a guy that turned me on to it, 2 is a chick that ive known for more than 10 years and was pretty fucking close. The 3rd is a girl i didnt know done it but found out from my long time chick friend because they was friends and she spilled the beans to me lol. Well all up until about a week ago, ive helped my long time chick friend out ALOT with many late talks about us hating who we have become and how we spent christmas together because noone else wanted us there. 
     So about a week ago she calls me crying her eyes out telling me how she fucked up so bad and got caught doing some thing sooooo fucked up. She talks about how she is never going to use Again. So i say well starting tomorrow im rigbt there with ya. We we will help each other. I would start today with you but you called as im pulling off from our guy lol. So tells me awesome okay we can do this. I tell her i know we can. 
     So next day comes around and I tried to call her and text her and I get no reply. I start freaking out. I was beginning to think she done killed herself because she was so upset do day before about what she had done. Second day goes around still no answer. And I start beginning to think what the fuck. Third day goes around still nothing, fourth day still nothing, 5th day still nothing, and today being the 6th day, she finally messaged back and says I can't be in contact with you because you have caved twice in the past six days where I haven't. I can't talk to you no more because you talked to them still and you still use.
     She begins telling me all this other different stuff about how she can be associated with me no more. And that she can't talk to me and this and that. And that hurts me. Because I love this girl so much. She means the world to me as a friend and if it were to be more than that that would make my day. Hell that would make my life to be honest. She literally broke my heart by telling me that. Because when she wasn't texting back I needed someone, anyone at all just to talk to but she was one of the last people to actually still be my friend. Because when I came out and told everyone I was in heroin addict trying to get help, I lost everyone. Everyone ran. No one talk to me anymore. Like I was some type of disease that they couldn't be in contact with. Now I'm kind of lost for words and don't know what to do considering the last person that never judge me and that was always there for me when she wasn't busy with our kid or family she was there...

I've been shooting ecp for the past month, almost every day, and each time I get high, around 3 hours after I shoot, I vomit. Sometimes I'll vomit right after I dose, but that's only when I snort it. Weird as fuck right? 

And I'm not talking about a little puke, I'm taking full on projectile vomiting over and over, then being okay for another hour or so. I've never had this happen before. I've shot fentanyl before consistently and never had this problem. I've been doing oxycodone for years and have only puked when I mixed it with hydros, Xanax, and Ativan all at once.

But lately, each time I get high, no matter if it's just dope, a speedball, a goofball, or snorted, I vomit a few hours after dosing. I know it's more common to vomit right after you push the plunger, but I'm fine then. I also know it's more common to puke when you're opiate naive, but I am definitely not.

The government certainly isn't. There is a reason these drugs are illegal, and it's because people can't be trusted with them. We are a danger to ourselves, and possibly those around us if you're the reckless type.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I understand where you are coming from. This absolutely shouldn't be a criminal matter, but sometimes tough love has it's place.  
  
What the United States, and for that matter, the world, is experiencing, is a Health Crisis, and it should be treated as such.  
  
I offer you sincere honesty, and transparency. Try to look at things from another perspective. Instead of a drug addict feeling victimized, look from the eyes of your victims, your families that care about you. Look at it from the eyes of the parents finding their children, their babies, their sons and daughters, laying dead on the floor. Children, living with parents that neglect, steal from, and abuse them.  
  
Imagine the parents are the government our country has voted into a position of power, with the help of medical professionals, and people that care about harm reduction at their dispense.  
  
I'm speaking of an ideal situation, but humans aren't perfect. We trip, we fall. Lord knows we fuck up.   
  
But I have faith, that one day, we're going to get it right. There are people in our community striving to enact change. To make a difference in this world, but it can be overwhelming. They can't do it alone. They need your help.   
  
I challenge each and every one of you to tell me why I am wrong for this opinion. The fact is, most of Reddit looks at this community as a bunch of filthy drug addicts. To them, you're a bunch of thieving scumbags. We are a minority. But maybe, just maybe if they came here and saw more people trying to make a difference. Than maybe we can slightly shift that opinion.  
  
I would like to have an educated discussion about this. Some of you are incredibly intelligent.   
  
I also fully expect some of you are going to resort to name calling and imply that I'm a filthy communist and a puppet installed by our fascist government. And that's OK. You're entitled to that opinion. You're just wrong

Pulled through cotton it is very translucent (instead of being cloudy). It very likely had fentanyl cut into it, based on what I've read and the apparent strength, but it also definitely had heroin as well, based on the smell (and appearance). (I've noticed smell is the best indicator. It's hard to smell small amounts, like my 4 stamps for $20 that would normally be 25 bucks, but as soon as it hits water, it reeks of vinegar within a few inches of it.)

Anyways, I missed my shot, 4 stamp bags. Almost completely missed it. Normally, when something goes wrong, I still feel some rush because I obviously didn't miss the whole thing, but this time I must have missed the whole thing or almost the whole thing, I was trying to let the tourniquet off before I started pushing instead of right after pushing, which is stupid because I've been doing this forever and my go-to, gnarly twisted vein probably actually prefers the tourniquet being on at this point. So anyways I tried calling to turn it off and I must have just lost the vein and not got much of anything in there.. I got a nasty, itchy, raised white area raised and red and white Etc but it wasn't horrible because I knew that it would go away quickly and they wouldn't have an abscess or anyting because this stuff isn't that nasty.

Anyways...high still came on, it just took a couple minutes and a lot of rubbing. I felt really high still, but I got to enjoy the come up. Very nice.

They refuse to allow the supply of pharmaceutical grade heroin that could be precisely and consistently dosed.

**Where there is a demand, there will be a supply.** Our governments continue to gift this lucrative and highly profitable illicit drug market to violent criminals and organized crime. 

The 50 billion dollars the US government spends on this ""War on drugs"" each and every year is a lot more than 50 billion because for every dollar they directly spend, many more must be subsequent spent attempting to clean up the mess it makes. The profits and taxes from regulated heroin could **help to pay down** national debt. With an end to the war, they might well be able to **actually pay down** the debt as the spin-off and indirect economic benefits would be far reaching and enormous.

Some 50% of people in US prisons are there for simple drug possession. Just one of the many reasons (all reasons are inappropriate) they won't change the prohibitionist drug laws is because private prisons are big business, yet the savings from ending the ""War on Drugs"" would easily allow them to continue to pay these companies for running prisons that would be empty if the war was to be ended.

It's also racist and remains so. These laws first came to be **not based on the harm from the drugs, but rather who was perceived to be using them.** The first drug prohibition laws in California and Nevada, driven by racist fears of Chinese transforming white women into opium-addicted sex slaves. The first cocaine prohibition laws, similarly prompted by racist fears of black men sniffing that white powder and forgetting their proper place in Southern society. And the first marijuana prohibition laws, all about fears of Mexican migrants in the West and the Southwest. 

Today, many years later, these prohibitionist drug laws remain what is also clearly a war against people who don't have light colored skin: If you are apprehended in possession of illicit drugs, you have either a 90% chance of going to prison or a 10% one which can be directly correlated to the shade of your skin color, outrageous!

This senseless and wasteful “War on Drugs” is not only very wrong (on so many levels) but also the most epic failure and inappropriate legislative policy of all time and has caused totally unnecessary immense loss of life and inexcusable human suffering which will no doubt be viewed in the future much like human slavery and the Salem witch trials are today.",1546891161.0

Sup guys. I've been an opiate user and lover for the past 5 years or so of my life, particularly the last 2 1/2 or so. I started getting real heavy into painkillers after a bad breakup and got addicted to taking 1-4 of the little blue 30mg oxys every day for about a year. That whole year was pure bliss and I loved every minute of it... Mainly cuz my tolerance hadnt ever been completely shot yet and those blues always got me feeling warm, fuzzy, and hella happy/optimistic about life. 

Well... After that year my plug got cut off and I had the choice of continuing on with the blues for $35-$40 a piece (was getting em for $10 prior to that) which obviously would have made me broke fast, or switch to H which my good homie claimed was the cheaper route and got you wayyyy higher. I knew I had already done China white a few times before and I really enjoyed that, especially mixing it with the blues. But I was never too big of a fan of tar, which was what my homie was recommending. I remember always telling him ""dude I'm not addicted to H like you are, I'm addicted to painkillers""... But I figured if my only option to continue using opiates was to start with tar then fuck it I might as well (worst choice ever btw). 

So I started off with making my tar into ""cheese"" so it went from tar to a snortable powder, a RoA I was already fond of so I took a liking to this method, and sometimes doing ""monkey water"" where you melt the tar down in water then shoot it up your nose. I began liking it more and more and eventually I started smoking it, since my homie claimed it got you way higher, and also would be better for me since putting it in my nose always clogged my nose and was semi painful to do anyways... So I started smoking it and my habit got worse and worse and so much more expensive then I could have ever imagined. It actually made me go broke for the first time in my life...  (Was smoking around 1-1.5g a day)

So Ive been dealing with this addiction to H for about the past year and a half and have quit and relapsed like 5 times in that period. I always relapse cuz I think I'll be able to handle it again ""only on weekends"" or ""just for a few days"" but I always fall right back into the cycle.... 

So my question to you guys is, if I was to quit for months this time, and perhaps come back to opiates with just weak painkillers on occasion, maybe once a week or every other week if even, do you think I would be able to handle it? Or fall right back into the cycle in time? Have any of y'all had success with this type of thing? I don't wanna go back to H, but I would like to be able to enjoy a painkiller from time to time, just like I do with any other drug. 

TLDR: used to love painkillers but my habit progressed to H, I've quit 5 different times already but always relapse and start again. Id like to quit for months and perhaps come back using only weak painkillers on occasion, no more H whatsoever. Have any of y'all had success with this kind of thing before? ",1546881988.0

That got me thinking about when that happened to me.

So my girlfriend at the time got in a bit of trouble and had to go to a year long rehab a few states over. And at the time I thought she was the one haha, I was 19 and o was I wrong but that’s another story. I was upset so my usage went up. I lived in a party house , so about a month later, I met this girl . She was a solid 8. Big ass,nice c cup boobs, pretty face, and about 120 pounds. 

We clicked that night and ended up sleeping together. We fucked for hours without me cumming. But I was able to blame it on the booze, I don’t think she minded anyway lol. Opiates are great for first sexual impressions. So the next day we hung out. One thing led to another and we fucked with the same result. This time we where both “sober”. After a while we stoped. I could tell she was bothered. So I told her that I was in my own head and felt bad that I was cheating. She knew I had a gf and that we where together for a couple years. So she bought it. I did feel bad but I was young, dumb, high, and horny lol. 

A few days later she comes over and we have sex. About 40 minutes in she gets up quick and goes in the bathroom. I knew what that was all about. She’s comes out a few minutes later and gets dressed. I ask her what’s wrong and she’s like “ I really like you a lot, i don’t think you’re attracted to me. I’ve never not made a guy cum”. Now, I could tell her I’m a heroin addict, which might scare her off. And honestly the sex was really good. Or lie my ass off. 

I choose the latter. I told her the first 2 times was a fluke and I was almost about cum. So a couple hours later we fuck again. At about the 20 min part. I faked cumming haha o how the roles reversed. She was all like did you cum in me? I was like yeah I told you it wasn’t you. She wasn’t as happy as I thought she would be. She told me she was going to go home shower, get ready and come back. 

When she came back she seem super happy. A couple hours later she started puking excorist style. All over my bed, door, floor. It was vomiting at biblical proportions lol. So I clean her up and everywhere else. She is aslo erupting from the hole down under. I feel pretty bad for her. I ask her what she thinks she has. Well apparently projectile vomiting and explosive shits are possible side effects of plan b hahaha. She told me she wasn’t on the pill and she didn’t want to get pregnant. And she didn’t tell me she wasn’t on the pill because she didn’t think I’d fuck her. I never told her I faked it lol. 

I ended up breaking up with my gf for her. We didn’t last, she cheated on me, big surprise lol. She broke up with about a week before my ex got out. And we got back together. I have super crazy stories about that gf if anyone cares to hear those stories ",1546881711.0

I have work at noon today so I was kinda dreading that until I decided to take some subs.

The only other time I had suboxone was last April in rehab and I wasn't using enough back then to really need any. Took 4mg and threw up for 24 hours pretty much because they way overshot the necessary dose if any lol. However, last night all my symptoms went away and are gone. I feel a just a little high but I will be able to function way better.

Two quick questions:

My withdrawls were pretty mild in the grand scheme of things, bout a 12 on the COWS scale. After this sub wears off will I be hurting very much at all anymore? 

Also, I have a dentist appt Friday and they are sedating me because I hate the dentist but the mixture I heard him say was fent and midazolam along with something else. Will the bupe or naloxone interfere?

I have a week left of my meds and it never fails when I get down to that low of an amount that I start freaking out and worrying about all the possible what ifs of not getting my meds this month. Anyway, I will be taking the same amount of meds I always do, but I will start having stomach issues, more pain, less effect from the meds, and just feel on the verge of withdrawal. I know it's all in my head. I know that psychologically I have some how manifested the symptoms due to my anxieties. Does this happen to anyone else when they are near running out?

I was just wondering if any of you who use prescription opioids such as oxycodone have experienced flank or kidney pain. I’ve been prescribed oxycodone IR and ER for several years, and I’ve been experiencing chronic pain around my left flank, and sometimes the right side too. Not severe, but definitely uncomfortable. Feels dull/achy and sort of like there’s pressure in the area. But when I take a few weeks or months off of the meds, the pain goes away. Within two weeks of starting back up the pain returns. 
I don’t use any formulations containing APAP. 

Have any of you experienced this, or know of any issues that can arise involving your kidneys after long time use of prescription opioids? I have a PM appointment in a few weeks and plan to bring it up, I just want to ask around a little in the mean time.

Funds are low right now, and thus, I only had $20, which is the bare minimum to see my dude and cop a Half bun (5 bags of ECP). I get to the spot, talk to him on the phone, and let him know I need a Half.

After an unusually long wait (30 mins....he’s pretty good with time and I’m typically out of there within 10 mins), he pulls up and comes to the passenger side window of the car I’m in. As per usual, he asks how much money I got. I’m not sure why he always does this, as that part of the transaction had already been discussed two separate times with him before meeting up. But whatever, I tell him $20, he reaches into his pocket and gives me my shit.

We pull out right away and as we’re a couple blocks down the street, I retrieve the goods from my pocket and that’s when I realize he actually gave me a Full bun (10 bags).

Now, I realize this isn’t too big of a deal...just a $20 mistake on his part. But I’m still not sure as to the proper etiquette for this. I always come correct with him, and on the rare occasion that I’m short a few bucks, I tell him beforehand and he’s always cool with it. I don’t spend buku bucks with him, but I do see him every day and spend about $100/day with him on average, between my personal shit and those I middle for.

2: I’ve heard of people snorting it and I like snorting, the pills are M 4 and white if that would be a factor in if you can. So is that viable and not stupid to do? Ik some pills have some abuse proof tactics or stuff that make it not worth it so just figured I’d ask y’all before I do. 

3: How does it compare to Hydrocodone Oxy and morphine in terms of euphoria sedation etc? 

4: Would $6 for 4mg be fair? 

5: Does it tend to have more or less of certain side effects? Like nausea itchiness etc, I’ve found hydrocodone to make me feel more those ways than Oxycodone even at their equivalent dosages is why I ask. 

I am currently and planning to do more intensive research as always but I always like to have a discussion and find it to be most beneficial to get anecdotes or maybe somebody with good sources etc. love getting informed through both ways and highly appreciate the help.

&#x200B;

I need some insight from you fine people. Typically I only stick to oxys when it comes to daily use. However, for the past week straight I have been trying to cut down my oxy use because I can no longer afford to spend $300 a day on 10 30s... I had the brilliant idea to try and combat my cravings to do more oxy by using cocaine all day long with my oxys. The past week, I managed to cut my oxy intake down from a 300mg daily habit to I believe 150mg at most in one day. The other days I managed to only use around 90mg on average. Now, the problem is I told myself I would stop using cocaine after 2 days of consecutive use, but it's now been 7 days in a row and I am starting to get worried. When I jump off the oxy's completely, I am well aware that I will have to go through withdrawal from them. However, will a week straight of cocaine use ranging from .5 to 1g a day cause withdrawal symptoms from coke as well? I've also been taking 1-2mg of xanax a night the past 3 nights in order to fall asleep. I know this combination is dangerous and you all will probably think i'm a dumbass, but god damn doing coke and blues at the same time is fucking amazing. 

&#x200B;

Pretty much I'm just wondering how long it usually takes someone to begin to withdrawal from coke? at first I thought it would be similar to people who just began using oxy/dope daily where it takes like 1-2 months of consecutive daily use, but I have very little information on coke withdrawals and how long consecutive daily use would cause someone to withdrawal.

I just want to tell you my story guys and will understand how Wika is wonderful.

We've been together for a year now. Yay ! But before we were a couple i was addicted to xanax. I was popping 12 to 20 xans a day. Wika, was the closest friend i ever had and I've known her for almost 10 years. When we began dating I was addicted to Xanax and she knew it but didn't think much of it until the first dinner she organized. She invited her friends over to introduce me. Everything was going fine until i was so high on ketamine and xanax that i broke a frame on her wall while walking like a drunk. That ended the night and all of her friends saw me as a fucked up druggie. Wika was mad at me for acting like a foul and she was right. I completely ruined that night and she was so happy to introduce me but i fuck it up.

I made everything to make her angry at me while i was on xanax and she always forgave me because everything i said i would stop i did not. Then i started texting with my ex while i was high only when on xanax. I nearly lost Wika because of my bad behavior. I'm so sorry I'm still asking myself why are you still with me. I decided to stop xanax for good and i completely stop all contacts with my ex because its wrong and because i love my Wika more than anything. I wont be able to live without her. She's my goddess and i want to spend of my life with her.

&#x200B;

A couple weeks ago we found a way to get Hydromorphone and Midazolam vials. So we began injecting. I already have a problem with both opiates and benzo in my past but how can i say no when i see Wika shooting up. She's the one who do the dirty work and obtain those vials. The addict in me feel like im not getting enough of it. She has the control of all of these vials mostly because i cant stop abusing Midazolam. I stole some vials a couple of time in the back of my girl because of my selfishness and she found out. I said i would never do it again but i did. Im so sorry, i know you could never trust me anymore. Thats why i decided to write this. To show you how sincere i am with my promise. I know it will take time for you to trust me again. I can show you that im able to respect my promise.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything. Its not easy for me to control myself with all that drugs near me but i can do it. I don't want to break you heart anymore. I know heard that alot of time but like i said i will control myself. I wont do anything on your back anymore because i will loose you and thats my biggest fear. Wika you're so good to me. Too good. You're the best thing that ever happen to me and i dont want to loose that.

&#x200B;

Since we've been shooting Hydromorphone regularly its been hard on our couple. We get mad at each other so easily and i feel that our relationship is fragile but i would do anything possible to please you like before. Opiates are really great together. I love our morning shots and our night shoot. The ones at your break. I dont want this to end i mean our relationship. Not because of drugs.

&#x200B;

Wika i love you more than anything in the world. Thank you for bringing me to BC last summer even if we had a rough ending in WDs for a week.

Here is the kicker. I grew up playing hockey almost from the day I could walk. I grew up despising basketball a sport I despise to this day. I suck at basketball I can’t make a basket to save my life I don’t understand the rules and the rules I do understand I absolutely hate cause they seem to make the game cater to pussies as absolutely 0 contact is allowed and well in hockey it’s the absolute opposite.

Anyways apparently in my fantasy tho I’m Stephen curry and  am sinking baskets at an incredible rate. Here’s the kicker tho. My aunt heard me in the other room and knowing I was alone was a tad bit confused about my enthusiasm/slurring of this basketball lecture so when she came to my room I had to think fast..,so I grabbed my phone and pretended i was on a call and had it on speaker. Highly doubt she bought it but needless to say it was fkn hilarious",1546833376.0

The thing that sucks about using opiates for a long time is that you remember that feeling of warmth and positivity. That pure happiness and optimistic outlook. I never had physical dependance on them but what kept me going back was the need to feel something. Feeling normal just sucks. Nothing compares and it just feels like something is missing all the time.

A Safe Place...Kinda...," Edit for this sub: This is another one of my Blockbuster related stories but, since it has to do with drugs I thought ya'll would appreciate it as well.

Ya'll, keep asking for them so heres another one.

During the summer, and somewhat during the school year, parent would usually either drop their kids of or have them come to the store to wait on them. We thought it drove sales and as long as we didn't have to watch their every move we didn't give a shit.

Of course, these kids would get older and therefore, get into more shit...

So, one day on one of my many smoke breaks which I took on the left corner of the store as you were going out, the familiar and undeniable smell of weed flows by me. There were a few cars parked on the side of the building so I figured it was one of those. As I kept smelling it (and I'm not talking about some skunk shit either. The kids in this neighborhood came from upper-middle class homes so of course they had good smoke) I decided to see just where it was coming from. I didn't have to go far to see one of the regulars kids going ""Oh, shit the long haired guys seen us! Hide the shit! Spray the car!"" So, I creep up to the car and allow a wicked smile to crawl across my face. ""So, Max, what you doing buddy?""

Max, being about 16 or 17, I think, wasn't to knowledgeable about the ways of the world. He didn't know that a long haired white guy probably smoked weed. Knowing this I proceeded to fuck with him hard.

Max: Nothing, man. Just deciding what we want to get.

Me: Fuck, it smells like good weed out here! You guys smell that?

Max: Must be one of the other cars. (He says this while pot smoke continues to bellow out of his car window, mind you.)

Me: Ok, could you guys do me a favor?

Max: Yea, whats up?

Me: Quit bullshitting and pass that shit!

Well, he in fact did pass that shit, and from then on I had an understanding. Here were a list of rules that I gave Max and his friends.

&#x200B;

1. I don't know shit.
2. Only weed is to be smoked out here. If I see you out here snorting coke or shooting heroin I am telling your parents. (Also, for any of you out here wondering if I ever gave these kids pills FUCK TO THE NO!!! I sure as fuck wasn't about to get that started.)
3. Don't bother other customers with it.

I told them that as long as they kept it cool and followed those rules I didn't give a shit. They could smoke in blockbuster parking lot any time they wanted.

Now for those of you who are about to give me shit let me explain something. I didn't want these kids getting a fucking drug charge or worse over something as benign as pot. This way back before even Colorado thought about legalizing it so, the charges were steeper than they are now.",1546809771.0

Have you ever met, or dealt with, a plug that had literally no business being a plug? I mean you seen some of the shit they did and you wonder how they haven't been caught?

Let me tell you about one of mine.

This stupid bitch was like sixty something and dumber than a bag of hammers. First of all, they would always have at least 5 to 6 cars in their driveway. This might be something you could do occasionally but, damn near everyday doesn't make you look like a plug at all. Then, after you found a place to park and went inside it looked like a goddamn waiting room. You would sit in here living room/kitchen and wait for her to call you up stairs. Of course, the conversations going on down there were about what the came here to get. So, if anyone happened to record ANYTHING they could very well hang the whole room. (Someone did this and I am getting to that keep reading)

But letting this shit go on wasn't even the stupidest. This mother fucker was basically a pharmacy. She made bank but, then she would give said ""bank"" to her ""boyfriend over seas who had all this money but, needed her to send him money for a plane ticket home"" or ""Nigerian princes"" What's more, she had one son that weighed every bit of 800lbs and had never seen his own dick let alone a vagina. So, a friend of a friend sets him up with this bitch that has two mean ass kids. Heres the thing with that. All she cared about was money and/or drugs. So, guess what she would threaten to do if he wouldn't give her any money or said ""Kick rocks"" cause he was tired of her shit? Start recording people, people who thought they were to ""Acquire said goods"" and had no baring on anything going on over there. I mean, I saw this stupid bitch sitting across from the drive way recording people. All of this so she would have something to hold over the sons head if he ever tried to get rid of her. Oh, but she wasn't done yet... Her two dumb ass kids were telling the school system what was going on over there. This place was raided at least two times that I can remember hearing about.

But, wait there's more...

She gets her ex-con cousin to move in with her who is required to have random visits from his parole officer. This cousin of hers was also still balls deep into his own game. So now you have all this shit going on among the plugging! And, no, it really didn't stop people from coming over there. Business might have dropped a little, but people still kept going over there. I myself quit going over there when I heard about people being pulled over as the left her street.

Not to mention after awhile the stupid bitch started playing favorites. This happened a lot with other plugs I know. When I first got into this I always thought it was whoever had the money. Just tell you how stupid she was with this: my grand mother passed away a few years ago and left be a decent chunk of change. I call up this dumb ass plug and say ""I got 3 grand and I want whatever you got"" (Also, she had known me for a few years at this point so it wasn't like she had known me a month and I was trying to buy her out) And the dumb mother fucker comes back with ""I got other people to sell too"" and wouldn't sell me shit. What had happened she was selling everything to these well off mother fuckers who were paying 10 per back when the standard was 6. 

Safe to say I got away from this doofy bitch before anything really bad happened....",1546794334.0

He's a cool guy and knows we like to experiment now and then with drugs, especially psychs and ketamine, but we never touch opiates/oids unless they're straight out of a pharmacy... considering this damn fentanyl monster that assholes brought around ruining the possibility to safely enjoy so many substances we enjoy :( 

A few years ago he gave us a a few scripts of oxy 30's and we snorted through all of those over the course of a year or so. This time though, there's something about this hydromorphone molecule that is especially euphoric - the 2 of us each snorted about 40 (so about 80 of the initially 90 we were gifted) over the course of the last few days while eating a lot of LSD and fucking like animals all over the house.

Anyways, we decided instead of keeping the last 9 and a half 2mg Dillys we had left, we'd just finish them off so they wouldn't be on our mind and then take a nice year (or several year) break from opiates again. 

We did some research to avoid a freak accident and grabbed one of her dads unused insulin syringes that he has all over the place, as well as the other prep materials recommended.

This is the first and only time we're ever tried shooting something (except I want some IV LSD or DMT when I'm on my deathbed!)
She went first and still wasn't feeling anything by the time she was giving me my (2x2mg) 4 mg shot and I didn't feel anything for a few minutes either.

Then all of a sudden.... BAMMMM OOOOh AHHHH WOW! It hit us like a train! Now i know why so many people struggle with addiction especially when needles get involved. Starting to come down but can still barely keep one eye open enough to see what I'm doing trying to type lol. 

I am never going to Iv anything else again (unless it's in a hospital or something for legitimate medical reason(s)), although as you might imagine I'm very glad I finally killed my curiousity regarding IV administration of a drug and have no desire to repeat this experience, mainly because it feels WAY TOO GOOD...

Backstory: IV opiate user for 6-7years, ruined everything. Broken engagement, lost a 6 figure job at age 22, over doses, lost loved ones, homelessness, jail time, felony record... Ect.

I make parole in October after killing out a calendar. Decide im done with it. Moved home and got into a suboxone clinic. Been doing exceptionally well considering where I was. Had a slip up for a week or so when I found some insanely cheap Dilaudid. Started seeing myself slip up again and got back on track.

So with a past like myself, and all that follows, finding love or any meaningful personal relationships can be a chore. The thoughts of how do I tell them about my past? My record? Things that should be someone's knowledge if they're going to dive into a relationship. 

I go to Tinder trying to just throw myself out there. I start talking to this girl and we flirt and talk on the phone text back and forth then I meet up with her last night.  She's insanely beautiful, smart, funny, nice body, good job. The whole package. We go out for a few drinks and dinner and start to talk. She asks if I'm happy to be in this new state vs where I just came from. I say yeah, I had to leave. It was just far to toxic for me. 

She responds with how where she moved from was toxic for her too. I ask her why and she flat out says well my drug of choice was dilaudid... Holy fucking shit!??! 

She has a similar past, record, everything I was nervous about she has been through the same thing. She has been clean for 5 years and off suboxone for 2. She comes back to my place and we hit it off. Have plans to go to her place tonight. 

To wrap it up I just want to thank Junkie Cupid for aligning the stars and allowing me to be myself and enjoy the company of someone who understands first hand an opioid addiction. Don't want to fall head over heels to soon but damn.

Update: She stood me up today. No calls, texts or anything. Had a night planned out to take her to dinner and go mini golfing. Wish I hadn't taken my subs earlier. Wanting some H real bad. Fuck it.",1546790686.0

i have 200mg of what is apparently #4 heroin (my dealer got it off the deep web), it’s mostly a very pale pink (almost off white) with some darker pink spots in it. haven’t used opiates in months so probably don’t have a very high tolerance, my usual oxy dose was 30-60mg, highest dose i ever took was 80 and i was drinking/on xans/acid as well (stupid i know but oh well) 

was planning on trying it out with a friend sometime next week but obviously don’t want anything fucked to happen to either of us. friend has history with painkillers but has also never tried heroin, i don’t think he’s done opiates in a fair while either. 

ps: don’t need anyone to preach to me abt not doing heroin, etc etc, where i live it is very, very rare so i know i overpaid for it and i probably won’t ever buy more. tyvm 💖",1546754456.0

Some similar to what Im going to say, but so different. I am in my mid thirties, for the most part healthy, lift approx 5xs week, mom of two. I was prescribed tramadol from my doctor approx 9.5/10 years ago. Was prescribed 50mg, take 1/2 tabs every 4/6 hours as needed all those years. So, i took my full 8 pills daily. About 5 years into it, i lost my insurance. Tried to stop my meds, it was pure hell. Already knew i was dependant at that point. I couldnt take wd's and ended up doing private pay to keep seeing my doc. So, still no insurance & he retired a year ago. So, since last January, i basically have had one reliable place to get tramadol, but not as many i was used to. Plus, omg, i hate buying them after i used to pay $10 for my month supply. Im a normal person, not a partier, but i cant kick these. I forced tapered myself from 8 pills day to 4. Well, now day 3, no meds. I cant handle it..ppl dont realize how hard trams are to come off, cause they work on your serotonin & you are basically having the effects of opiate & antidepressant wd simultaneously. Mine has been almost all antidepressant discontinuation problems. I cant sleep. I will fall asleep about 5am, sleep 3 hours, and im exhausted..the rls and pains in my legs, now its my entire body..my arms and fingers even tingle. I have no energy.  Im trying to get a grip. Everyone who knows me, knows. Im not ashamed. I was legally prescribed this and never abused it. I think ppl think im crazy. Its hell. This isn't even all my issues from it. Im just exhausted and thought instead of searching threads, maybe I'd write one. If anyone has any advice. Anything, feel free. I want to say, i dont think like an addict. I like how i feel on my meds, but i dont feel high. If i get my meds, i never take more than ive tapered to. I dont wan my body get used to any higher dose. Someone gave me 2 percs. I didnt really want them, but i break in half and it almost takes the edge off. That stronger medicene does nothing for my body compared to the ""weak"" tramadol.

Well I have some idea.

Background - exactly 6 months run. All pills either M30 or OP80. Snorted and swallowed. Very high usage no lower than 160mg per day and as high as 560mg in 24 hours, probably averaging 400mg per day.

Last week just op80s, swallowed, (mostly) not crushed. 3 in 24 hours for a few days, 2 for a few days, 1 for 2 days, today is Day 1 completely off (36 hours since last dose) and I feel withdrawals about a 1.5/10 level. Took kratom twice today.

I suspect the OP80s are really equal to about a 30mg dose. Yes, I know it contains 80mg, but it doesn’t all hit u at once so maybe it works on softening down the fall to the bottom.

To say the least, I’m absolutely, completely, entirely, fucking shocked.

Any thoughts?",1546726076.0

I am, thank God, but since my absence, and even sporadic posting before that, this sub has gained SO many new members, and a lot of you probably don't recognize my username. That's OK, it's fine. That's not what this is about.

I had no idea people would ask me to tell more about that lol. So, I will try to post a new story in this sub detailing my twenty years in this game. Thats right from the time I was 14 and hit by a truck till now (Well really I have just laid off alot I am not totally sober by any means) I have had my eyes if nothing else in the game. So, to start let me give ya'll a few bits of knowledge I have gotten from my tenure with pills.

First of all if you're just getting into this, get out now. If this were, say, ten years ago I would say ""Have fun."" But, given that the economy has inflated as it often does,  what use to be 5 dollars per is now going up as high as 10. Not to mention that most people can only see one doctor at a time any more and even in the drug game there is supply and demand. Its just basic economy.

Also, stop snorting the damn things and get more for your money. When you snort a OC or a RC all you're doing is getting that high for about an hour. If you would chew it up and A) that high would hit you in about ten minutes and B) that high would last you between 6 to 8 hours. Why the fuck would you pay 25 dollars for one tiny pill for an hour of euphoria?

And Lastly, H is not a good substitute. Why it does the same thing do you have any idea of how much your're getting or how strong the dose is? No. Not to mention all the shit that goes with using needles and all that. I know you can eat it, but if I am not mistaken don't it also put you to sleep? I use my high to get shit done not sleep all day. ",1546723546.0

I had to take a 10-panel non-DOT drug test for a new job.  I was stressing *hard* about it because I take about 60-70 mg of Vicodin per day and have for years, and don't currently have a prescription for it.  (Ironically, I need the health insurance from a new job in order to maybe see about getting a prescription...). I only had 3 days in which to take the test, so not enough time to quit.

I read just about every single thread on here and the weed subs about synthetic urine, and got some Quick Fix 6.2 from the manufacturer.  Didn't want to trust that getting it elsewhere was the real product.

Every thread I read emphasized practicing walking around with it wherever you plan to store it, and I completely agree with that.  I spent a good 60-90 minutes trying different places, etc.  I had gotten the 3 oz bottle, and found that that was too large to put anywhere discreetly, so I transferred it into a smaller travel bottle.  The problem with that was that there's a temperature strip on the original bottle and I was kind of stressed that it would end up being the wrong temp.

Anyhow, once I got it appropriately heated and tucked, I went to the clinic and filled out the paperwork and had to wait about 10 minutes.  Sitting in a waiting room trying to look natural and comfortable with a travel bottle and a heatpack in one's panties is a challenge.

The woman took me into an office and verified my ID and all that, asked me if I had anything in my pockets and showed me to the bathroom.  She put blue tablets in the toilet to turn the water, told me I had **90 seconds** and left.

I dumped the travel bottle into the sample cup while peeing in the toilet for real, and used a few drops around the rim of the cup because I had read that some lab techs will actually smell it (!!!).

After I came out, she took it and transferred it into a special cup, sealed it and then plugged it into some machine, had me sign a few things and I left.

The next week or so, I was really stressed out every time my phone rang, thinking it was going to be the MRO (medical review officer, who has to call you if there's an issue), but I never heard from them.  After 10 days, I emailed HR at the potential job and they told me that everything was good to go!

I would definitely try to quit and be clean next time, but this is a great option.  The only thing is that if your paperwork says ""X panel test **with confirmation**"", synthetic isn't an option, because the confirmation part is further testing to make sure it's human urine.

Anyhow, this is hella long, but I'm hoping that my experience helps someone else.",1546722430.0

Just know that you could go to several Doctors at once and as long as you used a different pharmacy for each script you were fine.

  
  Now what I will dedicate this post to is telling you just how much of a role pain pills played in the scheme of things. As I said before people often gave me pills for free movies. Now lets do the math. A woman once gave me 10 lortab tens for two movies. So, for roughly 8 dollars worth of movies I was given fifty dollars worth of pills. 

  
  But, wait there's more... 

  
  I wasn't the only person there taking them. 

  
  Enter Jason my store manager. Back in the day, high school and thereafter, we experimented with everything. From pot to katamine (not sure how you spell it but, it was a cat tranquilizer that you snorted, also called special K). After being hit by a truck at the age of 14 in 1998 I was given pain pills hand over fist and was even one of the first test subjects of Oxycontin. (Long before anyone figured out you had to crash them) So, naturally, being unaware of what the could do in long term I shared with him. 

  
  And, then I created a monster... 

  
  Folks, do you know what doesn't mix well with power? Anything, really but, pain pills sure as hell don't. I taught him how to play the doctor shopping game and the musical pharmacy game. He was already an asshole but, now he was an asshole over 9000. When he didn't have his fix he was the asshole from outer space. 

  
  And he didn't start small like the every other addict on earth. He wouldn't take one or two. Oh no. By my early twenties I was up to taking 7 per dose. So, trying to win a pissing contest that no one ever actually started he started taking 14 right off the bat. I mean as soon as he got a doctor of his own he was eating this things by the literal handfuls. 

  
  Now while being high as hell on the things, especially at a young age, you felt like you could do anything. There was nothing like taking a dose on a Friday and Saturday night and being able to run the length of the store for the customer to get a move they wanted. Also, even though I didn't need the pills for this, I had this little trick I would do with those long yellow locks in the side of the DVD and game cases. Where I would pull it out of the bottom of the case and flip it up in the air. That trick alone people came to see. Not to mention all the rewards I could sell on those nights. 

  
  Then, there was what it felt like when you didn't have anything and was left cold after a three or four day bender. You muscles cramped. You had the shits from hell. There were plenty of times I was paid seven dollars an hour to take a shit. Literally. You didn't feel like dealing with people let alone pissy people who were trying to get out of a late fee or a “restocking fee” (also known as bullshit). ",1546720268.0

Anyway, it was just like the movie, instead of people eating the different candies, they were eating different pills. The golden tickets were hidden in peoples prescription bottles when they picked up from the pharmacy or in a dboys dope baggies. Instead of the chocolate river it was hydromorphone solution.

Please read if you have a moment.,"Hey everyone. R/opiates and opiates helped me immensely through some of the toughest past few months I’ve ever experienced. With that said, I’m thankful to a habit of 100+mg Oxy/Day for allowing me to realize what I value.

This isn’t just about me, rather, the story of an addict under a substance’s mercy. I felt the need to make this because of a couple factors. From increased appreciation of living and the ability to work hard, to more energy and discipline, I’m finally getting my life back where I need it to be.

In reading this post, I hope such short words inspire that “I” to next be “you” if you make the jump. This life, no matter how difficult, is about more than where we are. Our intentions, emotions, and actions are what mold our being, not the end result.

If I can do this I’m confident that you can too. Let’s do it together.  Please use the period of detoxing as a positive place to gain clarity on what you care to do and who you care to become. Yes, it’s cliche, but it’s true to say that difficulty breeds  growth. If any of you want to reach out, I’ll happily make time. We’re all in this together after all.

Now that I have been paying again, I can’t enjoy it. The price of this stuff alone makes me want to quit.. 

I am self employed. On a bad month I make 5k, an average month I make 8100, and a great month I make 10ish. 

If you had income like this and a savings of ~ 13k, rent paid, and 8/900$ in your pocket.. would you feel guilty spending 3-400$ on a weeks worth of opana?

Sorry if this is a weird question. I know money is a touchy subject but I have become so damn greedy I can’t even enjoy my high.. I think the money is finally more addicting haha.. curious how everyone here justifies the $$ we all spend on this to themselves?

I mean if the bills are paid, rents paid, the savings are 5 digits, and I got 8/900$ in my pocket, and I’m under 30 and single(28 years old), should it be that big of a deal to drop 3-400$ a week? I mean I’m online asking strangers haha.. it’s driving me mad. I would probably chase a dropped quarter at this point haha

Sometimes when i think about all I’ve spent I wanna pull my hair out even though I’m not broke. How do you guys roll with it? I got spoiled by not having to buy my stuff for a half year or so and can’t adjust.. it’s tripping me out. EDIT: I also hate that I’m wasting money. Every time I snort one of these I think of how I could have given the $ to a homeless shelter or someone in need.. I want to help people, it’s my thing, and I could help so much more than I do if I could cut this spending! I just hate not having anything to show for it. 

Opiates do make my life quality so much better though. The times I’ve quit I always ended up planning my suicide about 15-21 days clean ( I was crazy and attempted suicide twice before I ever touched drugs... they saved my life sorta and made me able to function enough to start a successful business) and then say fuck it and go back because.. I’d rather be alive on opiates then dead. 
 ..I have some lifelong illness’ that arent curable and cause insane amounts of pain and makes it very hard to sleep (I sleep 2-5hr a night since 2015) and so hard to socialize with people. Opiates save me from the loneliness and pain. But they’re so fucking expensive. And after I’m on them 24/7 I have to take breaks because they loose that magic and I feel numb and not like a real person. I’ll loose interest in a lot. It’s such a double edge soward- they save me but they also dull me. And the fucking cost!!!

During all of his cardiac events, they use 2 types of syringes.

Temporary account for obvious reasons. My wife recently slipped on ice and completely shattered her ankle while tearing all of her ligaments. The doctors gave her an oxycodone prescription @ 10mg every 4 hours for 5 days. They also gave us a naloxone kit free of charge which made me worry about the dosage. I haven’t slept in 48 hours (since the fall) and would love to get some sleep without worrying about her, so I figured it’d be best to ask you guys about the dosage and whether or not the kit was overkill.

1) Is she at risk of developing a physical dependency at that dosage for the length listed above?

2) Was the naloxone kit overkill or is she actually in danger of OD-ing at that dosage?

No previous narcotic use//healthy otherwise.

Thanks guys!",1546648585.0

Wouldn’t this leave a lot of room for patients to be using other opiates outside of what’s prescribed to them?

A little background, I used oxy for about 5 years. Typical story, went from a blue every Sunday to about 210+ mg a day. Recently stopped, didn't use for about 5-6 weeks then ""relapsed"" (I don't count it a relapse because I never intended on ""quitting"", just didn't want to have to use everyday). And chipping is actually going well, had a 3 day binge before new years but haven't used since the 31st. Things are good.

HOWEVER, I will be the first one to acknowledge that I just genuinely enjoy being high in general. Opiates are and always will be my ride or die, but I just hate being sober. Anyway, before I get sidetracked I tripped on DXM last night. I used to do it all the time before I found good drugs lol and figured I'd get fucked up for a night.

I post this here because I know some of yall have been there, but fuck guys/gals, I have spent so much fucking money on this shit. I have (pretty much) destroyed my ex's life, and I feel like I may have destroyed my current girls life too. I had done a calculation of how much I spent, TWO YEARS AGO, and it came up to nearly 55-60k. I don't even want to know what it's at now. But fuck I could have bought a new car in cash AND put a fat ass down payment on a house. It's weird how certain drugs put things in perspective like this, but idk I'm just in a weird place right now. Overall I have an amazing outlook for the future, but fuuuuuuuuuuck do I feel some tremendous guilt. 

Sorry to vent. I'm more of a lurker than a poster but I still consider everyone of you family. Everyone one of you would be exponentially more understanding than my real family would be toward me. Shit, I haven't talked to either parents in almost 3 months now. If anyone wants to talk, PM me.

aclsdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/aclsdn/post_appendectomy_questions/,7,https://redd.it/aclsdn,Dane-o-myt,Post Appendectomy Questions!,"Hey every!

So Wednesday morning during work I started to get an ache in my abdomen. Got worse and worse until I had to leave work (which I never do, that was the second time I've EVER taken sick time at a job). Went home, grabbed a bug out bag, and went to urgent Care. After some poking and prodding, a blood test, and a CT scan, I was told to drive over to a different hospital to get my appendix removed.

Surgery (laparoscopic) from 9pm-9:50pm. Woke up from anesthesia at 10:30-11pm. Was home by 1am. I'm going back to work at my physically demanding job, but will be on light duty for the whole week. 

I am a user of kratom, but I have never used a traditional opiate before, so I have some questions.

When I woke up they were asking me about my pain level. I said I was a 2-3 sore, so they gave me some IV fentanyl. They asked me about my pain level after it was administered, and I said the same thing. Dosage unknown. Didn't really notice any difference.

Once I was fully awake, they monitored my vitals for a while and asked if I wanted some pain meds. Well DUH. So they write me a prescription, which my nurse helped me pick up on my way out the door. 

I was proscribed 12 hydromorphone at 2mg a piece. 

Woke up the next day, ate a couple crackers, and took one pill. Felt absolutely nothing. 

4 hours later, I took 2 pills. Again felt nothing.

In the evening I was sore, so I took 6 grams of kratom. That helped me out a bunch. Took 4 grams right before bed, which was a mistake because it made me sleep not so well.

So here's my questions:

Why did I not feel the fentanyl? Was it because I was still kind of intoxicated the anesthesia? 

Is hydromorphone a strong drug? I was looking at some charts of opiates. The couple that I had read said that hydromorphone was 7.5 times stronger than morphine. So 1.3mg hydromorphone is equal to 10mg morphine when taken orally. Were my 2mg and 4mg dosages not enough to feel? That's how much it said to take on the bottle.

I used to use 16 grams of kratom a day for a while. In December I quit cold turkey for a full week for tolerance break. Used for two days, then took just around two weeks off. My tolerance has decreased significantly. Would my kratom usage over the last couple years make it so I wouldn't feel the hydromorphone? 

After reading the rules I am pretty sure this is allowed. If anyone has questions or needs me to clarify anything, let me know. My pain is being managed pretty well just by not moving and ibuprofen, but I also took kratom again because I need to run to the hospital for a doctor's note. I have 9 pills left, and am planning on saving them for a rainy day at the moment.

Thanks every!",1546630893.0

Any advice is appreciated.

So September 2017, I got into a car accident and broke my right foot, left clavicle, and left forearm. I had to have surgery done to put metal hardware in the collar bone and forearm. A few months later, I fell and broke my left forearm again, and had to have surgery to take out the old hardware, and put in longer metal plates. During these 4 or 5 months of recovery, collectively, I had quite a few scripts for different pain medications prescribed to me by my orthopedic surgeon. Also maybe worth adding, I have a prosthetic leg, and after the car accident it does not fit as well anymore. Sometimes it can be quite painful to wear for long periods of time. Additionally, I frequently get aches in my left forearm.

I'm not sure if any of this this would be serious enough to warrant a doctor prescribing me medication, but I figured I would ask. Anyone with any similar conditions ever have any luck? I'm mostly curious about, what kind of doctor I should go see (my GP, or maybe back to my orthos office?), if I should even bother trying, and how I should ask. Thanks :)

Its hard for me to understand those that continue using lesser opioids like codeine to oxycodone instead of using kratom. It can be very strong if you get a reliable source.

I jumped from 100 mg prescription methadone to kratom, and had no withdrawal. I even felt pretty good. I had to go to the ER and was given hydromorphone every 2 hours. Then an oxycodone prescription after. And honestly the kratom worked better, I noticed. And i had no desire to go back to the other ones.

I mean the pros are that it's way, way cheaper, fairly strong, stops even strong opioid withdrawal, has different types, good at a step towards getting life together.

I'm not lecturing anyway at all! I'm just curious why some of the you don't switch. I can see it with opana or heroin of course.

There's definitely cons to kratom though. If you've taken some bad quality kratom, it probably seemed like shit. Its less predictable than a regulated dose. Its relatively weak (though on par with... Well.. it's in between hydrocone and oxycodone for me). It's finnicky in a way and can make some people nauseous if they don't know what they're doing. Also it tastes terrible. But most addicts have gone through worse than a bad taste for feeling normal.

But it's legal in most places and really has saved a lot of lives. It took me from essentially homeless to middle class income and a good life. Even people without opiate issues have found tremendous value in it. Which is probably why there's a massive outcry when they try to ban it. A lot of older people use it. The kind that vote.

But I don't know. I see if it gets banned, there's going to be a lot more heroin addicts coming up.

What's your experience with it? Good, bad? Was it weak or strong?

Haven't used any traditional opiates since 2013 (besides those given by a doctor once or twice and taken as directed). Have no will to go back to all that when kratom is dirt cheap. Unless you buy the bunk smoke shop stuff.",1546595396.0

Conflicted and could use some input,"Alright so last night I made a post referring to the amount of suboxone I've been taking the past week and a half (besides 2 days of dope). Basically I came clean to my family today, I am a 21 year old addict primarily oxy heroin (strong opioids in general) and benzos. I had a year completely sober living in sober houses and was beyond miserable the entire time although people say physically glowing, and managed to accomplish a significant amount in that time (get my first real apartment, hold down a decent job, save lots of money, etc). When I moved out of sober living it was not long until I relapsed on oxy, as this addiction shit goes it got worse and worse and was hanging on by a thread not becoming physically addicted. I had 2 days sober I want to say and I couldn't even motivate myself to get out of bed a couple weeks ago with no real physical withdrawals just insane depression. I have crippling anxiety, depression and am my own worst enemy. I have spent probably a few grand on oxy at this point, was getting back into heroin, and becoming extremely chemically unstable up in my brain beyond the problems I suffer from without the drugs. My family is on board with me seeing a sub doctor, and I am thinking that it might be good for me considering I struggle so much with complete sobriety (self doubt, insecurities, etc). Since I've been taking the suboxone I have noticed a much more balanced mentality in myself and I genuinely believe that getting suboxone prescribed by a doctor may be seriously beneficial for me for the time being. I would like to use suboxone as a tool to help me feel normal, and what I mean by this is use it in a way that I can wake up everyday, work, continue to think about my future and keep my eye on the prize, which would be success and happiness. For those of you who have been on suboxone for 6 months and over, what does it feel like to you? Still at this point of taking it it improves my mood, makes me sociable, kills the negative thoughts in my head for the most part (self doubt, self consciousness, insecurities) which are some of the greatest things holding me back considering I am loved by so many. I returned to my home town last weekend after almost 2 years all drugged out because of how unstable I was and how in the grips of addiction I've been and I felt so bad to appear like that in front of my friends who love and care about me so much. I don't want to be on suboxone forever, I just want to be on it at least until I can adjust to this new life in a new city all by myself a little more adequately, considering I've been struggling so much with it. Will these positive feelings that i receive from suboxone last? I'm not looking for a high as I know that will not last, I just want to know it it will continue to help me in the fields stated above in boosting my mood and limiting negative thoughts. Plus I can't keep spending disgusting amounts on oxy and I can't keep fucking with heroin ruining myself making my life a living hell. Any input would be great please and thank you! Also would like to add that if I go to a sub doctor which I would imagine could take a week or two and no longer have opiates in my system besides bupe, but am honest about what has been going on like I stated above, would it be possible that the dr would give me any trouble writing the scrip? Just curious. Again any experience/input would be great.

Tldr: planning on going to sub dr. Will mood boost, lack of negative thoughts (insecurities, self doubt, low self esteem, anxiety, depression, etc) sociability and motivation I receive from subs last? Also if a urine test comes back only bupe but explain I have been struggling with oxy/heroin addiction telling the truth will the doctor have any issues with writing me a script?

Very euphoric and sedating compared to say hydro and Dilaudid. Should have boofed the last 2 as well but ok well. Over all a very good impression from first time trying morphine. How do you guy like it compared to other opiates? ",1546586864.0

I want to get clean but I cant see my life without opiates, I’m in love with them and have chronic pain so they help me. I do abuse them so it’s not all for pain. I just don’t wanna go to rehab for 30-90 days and for me to fail. I know I have to want it, but I’m not sure I do. But I can’t live like this anymore, never having money, barely work, do nothing everyday I’m off and just find ways to make money to score my oxy. Today I tried finding heroin and couldn’t but got oc80s for a good price. But I know once I go to heroin I’m fucked I know I’ll fall in love with it, but still not sure if I’m ready. I’m sure many of you guys clean or not have been through this dilemma before, any advice? Btw I’ve never been to a rehab/detox before and my habit is 90-120/dose only dose once sometimes twice with a smaller amount and some Xanax. I don’t get blasted high anymore (occasionally I will if I take a break) I use kratom or small amounts (.25-1mg) suboxone when I don’t have any oxy. I just get bit of euphoria and feel good all day with no pain which is why I’m in love with it and god knows heroin gonna erase my pain and make me love my life for those few short hours ughh I’m just really stuck......",1546586804.0

acexp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/acexp8/wanna_hear_a_story/,11,https://redd.it/acexp8,geef1tz,Wanna hear a story?,"So there was this guy that I was seeing for a while, and every week or so he switched up his number. After seeing him for about 6 to 8 months I had gotten used to the fact that random numbers would call my phone and it would be him with a new burner. So one night, I get a call from a random phone number and I ask for 3 assuming it’s him (the guy sounded exactly the same on phone).  I hop in the car and head up and I call when I’m 15 min out and he tells me to go to somewhere that’s way on the other side of the city. Again, for some reason, I thought nothing of this as chalked it up to rotating his spots. Anyways, I get to the spot and shoot him an “I’m here” text and I proceed to wait. After about 20 mins some guy I’d never seen before walked up to my window and handed me my order. “That’s odd, I never met him before” I thought. I looked at what he gave me and I noticed that it was 6-.5’s and not all in one like normal and again I thought about how that was a lil strange, but by now I’m not feeling good and decide to pull into a McDs to do a shot. I put 2 bags in and did everything like normal as far as prep goes. When I pushed in the plunger I got a fat rush and then I all of a sudden got what started to feel like the good pins and needles and it slowly turned into a super hot and almost painful prickly sensation. It got to the point where my whole body was hot and felt like I was rolling in a bed of pins. Well, I realized that something was wrong, and not wanting to die in an empty-ass McDs parking lot at 3 am, I put the car in gear and got on the road to try and get home . Next I knew I was laying on the side of the road (in a puddle no less) with 2 EMts over me shaking me saying my name. Turns out I ODed, and at 65 mph I flew off the road and blasted a tree, totaling my new car (and killing the tree too). I noticed 2 state troopers were going through my vehicle. They found my kit and started asking a bunch of questions like when I last used and watnot. The fact that I had a prior for class A didn’t help. Not wanting to fuck myself over any more that evening, I preceded to clutch my head and  play super dumb and kept repeating “my head hurts, I need to lay down and rest”. Well after 5 mins, the state trooper that was questioning me gave up and told the emts “he’s yours” and I went to the hospital. I ended up getting a fat morphine shot before the nurses actually read my med history and saw that I was ‘experienced ‘, after which they got pissed and treated me like an asshole.  After 2 hours I realize that I still have the other 4 bags and somehow the cop didn’t find it. I went home, did a shot (safely this time) and picked up my replacement rental car, an Infinity QX60, which actually helped to soothe the pain of having wrecked my car. Later that day, my normal dude called and asked me why I didn’t come up last night and I told him about what happened. He was shocked and told me that it must’ve been from when he had an old phone stolen. Apparently in my area, dudes steal work phones from dboys and take over all their custys, and that’s what happened in this particular situation. I never heard from the mystery other dude ever again and ended up getting straightened out with a new car. I also received no charges or tickets or anything from the accident, seems my bullshit worked for something 😎 Except one of either the cops or the emts stole my microtech knife I had on me, but if that’s the price to pay, so be it.
Moral of the story is .......wear your seatbelt.... and if you get a weird feeling about something, go with it, it might save your life.

I’m not condoning getting high and driving, it happened. I don’t roll like that anymore anyways. I’m glad I didn’t kill anyone or myself. 

Stay safe out there Bros!!

He was 28. He was on this sub every day as far back as his search history would go. He told my mom he wasn't an addict. He knew what he was doing. He was a ""smart user"". The thing is, we believed him. I constantly worried and wondered if there was such a thing as a casual heroin user. 

One day we invited him to join us, my parents, husband, sister and my kids to see this dinosaur show. He said a friend invited himto play disc golf but he'd meet us later. Later came, but he didn't. You can go through my post history and read more details of that time but I'll tell you it was pure hell. Sometimes for me the real kicker is the stupid dinosaur show was just a few blocks from where they found him, dead in his car. 

But I titled this post about 4 years later. 

My mom still cries every day. 

My grandmother can't leave the house these 4 days every year because she's so upset. 

4 years have passed and most of your stuff is still untouched in your bedroom.

The truth is time sometimes makes it worse. The realization the other day that some day I will have spent more of my life without you than with you brought me to tears. (yes that's 20+ years from now but still just the thought...) 

Mommy prays some day someone will come and say you fathered their child and that somehow there is still part of you here. This is what brings her hope. Can you believe that. 

Because it sucks finding you in numbers and ""share a coke"" bottles. It sucks finding you in pennies and butterflies and whatever else makes grieving people feel better. Mommy is the queen of this. Her entire house is a shrine of found things ""you"" sent her. 

The physical pain of her grief is all over her face. If there is a hell I believe you having to watch her suffer like this is worse than any fire and brimstone. 

Four years later and my memories of seeing you lying there in the casket are just as vivid as that day. I wish I didn't look. I wish that image was no where in my head. 

Sorry at some point this post turned to me talking to him. That's how I always feel when I come here. I'm also so emotionally drained and physically tired. Sorry for the jumbled nature of this post. 

If you're out there reading this and want to try to get clean, please go to the thing with your family. Go to whatever stupid thing it is because maybe it will be the decision that saves your life. If you think maybe your family doesn't care if you're there or not, they do care. They do. 

I share this every year because if I can inspire one person to go one more day without using then I feel like maybe he didn't die in vain. I don't know how else to use my grief to try to do good. I'm open to suggestions. What do you think he would want me to do?

acepld,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/acepld/this_doesnt_seem_right/,5,https://redd.it/acepld,Destralian,This doesnt seem right,"I've never used heroin before. The closest I've come is using Oxycodone once (can't remember dosage) and I never felt much from that. I decide to try heroin as an alternative for meth, and I know that sounds stupid when written like that but there is a little more thought behind it.

Anyway I get my stuff and I'm pretty cautious cause I don't know how strong it's going to affect me. I pour out a little bit of the powder, break it up with a card and I'm left with a tiny thin line of ""heroin"" . My plan was to very slowly take a bit to test out the waters and reach a comfortable high. Before snorting an amount like I originally intended to I decide to just try the smallest 2 or 3 little specs that have spilled out near the line. I'm talking absolutely tiny, miniscule specs. I thought I'd do them first and then 10 minutes later do more and slowly ease into it. In all honesty I wasn't even expecting to feel anything from them.

Within moments after snorting then I feel a bit panicky since it's my first time. I sit around working through it when I feel my body getting heavier. It feels sedated but I'm still mentally nervous. The rate at which it starts to come on causes me to worry a little more because despite having the smallest amount it's getting stronger.

I go out of my room and make myself a black coffee and I when I go to talk to my roommate I found myself slurring a few words. After drinking a few sips from my coffee I decide enough is enough and try a cold shower to calm down. I was feeling sleepy and groggy in a bad way so I was hoping it would wake me up a bit.

I end up deciding to get a lift to a nearby hospital. It's still getting stronger and my body feels very numbed. Then I feel pins and needles through my arms and it gets so intense that I struggle to even move them. They felt as though they were floating and locked in place. One of my hands was slightly raised above my leg yet it was just hanging as if it was magically being pulled upwards. At this point my breathing was rather manual. I had to try with as much effort as I could to inhale and despite really trying it felt like I was just getting half a mouthful of air in each time.

My point here is I realise that sedation is normal. Hell I almost even enjoyed the sensation in my arms... But all of that for a couple of specs of powder? 

Before arriving to the hospital which was about a 50 minutes drive away I decided to wait it out because it stopped increasing in intensity and I sat in the car for a while. From that point everything started to tone down. A few hours later and I'm left just feeling a bit tired and chilled. My body feels ever so slightly numb.

Let me mention that there really was no euphoria through any of this. Mentally I was panicking and whenever I'd calm down I'd suddenly feel extremely sleepy and I struggled to focus on my breaths which then jolted me awake a bit more. It felt like a fight to stay awake. With that being said the sensation in my arms was actually nice aside from it amplifying more and more in a way that seemed like it wouldn't stop.

Heroin was sold as #4 China white. It's fairly white too. Can it really just be that strong with me cause my tolerance is non existent? Why was there no euphoria? Should I test it for Fentanyl? The way I was feeling from the tiny amount I did makes me certain that if I just jumped into doing my intended amount I would has passed out and probably not woken up. Does anyone else have any similar experiences?


Tldr: 
-Tried the smallest spec of ""heroin"", felt the effects continue to intensify to a point where I could barely move my arms and breathing became a chore. Sat outside a hospital in a car and let it slowly wear off. This doesn't seem right. Can heroin be that potent or did I get something else?

I’ve got a pretty high opiate tolerance from considerable heroin use, but I’m not sure where to start with these pills. (I currently IV maybe 1/4 gram a day of some pretty good quality dope.) What is a standard dose for someone with a tolerance to opiates? 

Also, can someone tell me or point me in the correct direction in regards to IV use of the pills. I’m sure I need to be worried about the binders used in the pills, right? So is there a water to mg ratio or something?

anyhoo, i have 102 days clean today, and it’s honestly all thanks to methadone. i was always so hesitant to get on it bc my sister is on it and she def abuses the fuck out of it, but i had tried everything else to get clean and nothing would stick - rehab, subs, cold turkey, nothing.

i used almost everyday for 11 years, starting with oxy and moving on to dope. i just kind of resigned myself to dying eventually. my parents were a huge help in getting me started, even though they had their own reservations as well due to my sisters behavior. but my path of addiction was never like hers, so i figure my path of recovery doesn’t have to look like hers either.

i am so glad i started on methadone. i don’t know if i’ll ever tell anyone besides my close family and boyfriend that i’m on it, just bc there is still such a huge stigma, and i don’t bring it up at meetings either, but it really has saved my life.

idk what the point of this post is. if anyone is having trouble getting clean and has the ability to try methadone, i would give it a shot. if you take advantage of the counseling that they offer and really try to use all of the resources that they have, it can be hugely beneficial. if anyone has any questions about getting started that aren’t super specific, i’ll try to answer them if i can. i know every clinic must have their differences but i want to help if i can. i’ve missed this community, it really helped me not to feel so alone when i was at my worst.

What would you IV users do? Im curious because boofing has a higher BA bioavailability then snorting so I'd think that a lot of people especially IVers would want that extra kick? Or would you just snort it and have to use more dope/wait for it all to kick in significantly longer???


Just curious!

Hi everyone, I have a 5-panel urine test today for a job, and I know I’m clean for most everything, but I am worried because last week I had an awful cold and took some codeine cough syrup at my in-laws (don’t worry, they have it to me). I think I took 4-5 doses, and the last one was about 6 days ago. All of the doses were the recommended dosage written on the bottle. I believe I will be okay because I’ve done nothing else but there’s a worry in the back of my head saying I won’t be. Are my fears unfounded?

Me and my boyfriend had some ketamine on new years night, we didnt hole but we were really damn high and having a great time. I now have codeine that i CWE both for me and said boyfriend. Would it be safe to drink it a week after the K high? Its roughly 100mg codeine each, almost no tolerance and we will be smoking a lot of hash.
On this low dose can we drink the extraction without worrying about some sort of brain damage? Sorry this sounds kinda newbie.

There I had a few drinks, I already drank before I left home, then I went to the bathroom to do a shot there. Not sure if I was drunker than I thought I was or if the dope was stronger, or possibly a combination of the 2. 

When I woke up there were ambulance personal around me ( had to narcan me twice ) and I was taken to the hospital. There I was told that someone who went for a piss saw the syringe and me laying on the floor of the bathroom stall.


I got out of the hospital a few hours ago, had to stay some extra time because I was severly hydrated. They did some tests and the results showed that my kidney and liver were not doing fantastic, years of heavy alcohol abuse ( alcoholic too ). I have liver damage. Was told to stop drinking or else I'm going to be dead in a few years.

Have any of y’all ever had or heard of any dealer doing kinda like a giveaway? I was thinking of doing something called like “free Friday.” The concept being for every half gram you buy, you get one ticket into the drawling. Do it for Monday - Thursday, then pull the ticket Friday morning and whom ever wins gets a free half to start off their Friday?

I’m trying to add stuff to help make customers even happier than they are now. All of regulars have the ability to tell me that they’re sick and then they can come smoke or shoot some where ever I am st the time, i do this so they don’t have to go through their day sick, and can hustle without shitting themselves. The 2nd offer i give regular customers, again these are regular customer whom i see more than 4 times a week, which is a “free/frontage $30.” This consist of a bag weighed between 0.35 and 0.4 g, or $30 worth, which they can request any day of the month. Here’s the kicker, the customer can decided to pay it back or not, I’m not going to bother them about it. If customer decides to pay it back then they are able to request another $30 worth the same month and again either pay it back or not followed by the decision to pay it back or not.

I don’t know. Or like a “throw in Thursday, and give everyone who spends “$X” amount or more on Thursdays, then add like a 0.15 or maybe 0.2. Just as an extra side.

Throw me your ideas, or if you’ve had anything resemble this and talk me through it and how it worked. 

Thank you, have a solid Thursday team. Stay safe,  stay high and stay away from the fucking cops.

For those of you who have ever injected cocaine intravenously (or to a lesser extent, smoked crack) you know just what I mean.

I only recently started posting on here despite being a looong time lurker. I recently had a few months clean and have on and off been using for maybe three weeks this time around.

They really are starting to grab me by he dick. I’m never one to get paranoid or tweakery but damned if I’m not starting to get weird paranoid shit when I’m all hopped up on IV cocaine. It’s odd that I am so surprised by this I suppose. “Of course missing nights of sleep and shooting speedballs will make you a little bit paranoid and loopy!” Whew, if anyone bothered reading this all the way though, your probably a weirdo but that’s okay.

&#x200B;

Did an IV shot of heroin, ECP powder. Now I'm fairly certain this ""heroin"" is not heroin at all, its some sort of fentanyl or analog or whatever. It gets me high and it's enjoyable, but it has absolutely pathetic legs. I feel like redosing almost every hour sometimes when binging all day.

&#x200B;

Anyway though; Did a shot a bit ago that gave me the most intense rush I've had from the stuff yet. So much that I said ""Whoa"". But what was weird was that my heart started racing, not super duper fast but pretty quick and so powerful, out of my chest. What is this from? I know my filter method is buttcheeks. Could that be my issue? I literally suck up as much as I can without anything and then throw the end of the q tip in for scraps. 

&#x200B;

I've heard of micron filters, regardless if this is my issue or not, where could I buy some?

I’ve got 6 and a half of these 10 mg methadone tablets left. I took one and a half last Saturday, and took two this morning. I got a pretty good high from it on Saturday but wanted more out of it so tried 20 today - pretty good today as well, and now have evidence from two different occasions of use that it doesn’t cause me any of the weird heart side effects. However I am now basically completely down from it (dosed 20 at 10:10 and it’s 6:40 now) and want to go up again. However I know methadone is unusual in that it’s half-life is much longer than it’s duration of analgesia. Is it safe to take another 20 right now? And by “is it safe” I mean “will it kill me” - I’m a pill popping opiate abuser, none of what I do with these drugs is safe, lol. 

As a side note my average dose of oxy (main DOC) is a full 30 blue for a nod (I get the real ones), the 20 of methadone didn’t get me a nod but gave me a sustained energetic buzz similar to what I’d get from doing a 15 mg oxy line.

And then he heard Mad-Eye Moody's voice, echoing in some distant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk. . . jump onto the desk. . .  
Harry bent his knees obediently, preparing to spring... ""

p. 427:

"" ""I asked you whether you want me to do [the Cruciatus Curse] again,"" said Voldemort softly.
""Answer me! *Imperio!*""

I will not, said a stronger voice, in the back of his head, I won't answer. . . .  
Just answer no. . . .  
I won't do it, I won't say it. ...  
Just answer no. . . .  
""I WON'T!""

Let's go out and find this plant !😂😊

I had to add this as this amused me. This is Wikipedia's initial description of the plant;

Epipactis helleborine, the broad-leaved helleborine, is a terrestrial species of orchid with a broad distribution. Its nodding flowers vary from greenish pink to purple. It prefers shaded woodland environments.

How good is that! The plant (and all the little animals/insects that munch on it must be having a whale of a time! Haha 😂😊🙏🇬🇧

For years now, I have shot my dope while on the toilet. I know most people shoot their dope in the bathroom, but it's the only place I will do it. I mean, during a year when I have found myself living alone in a 2 bedroom/2 bathroom rental house, I would still shoot up in the bathroom.

So one thing that I have had a lot of success with is popping right after I shoot up. I know it sounds nasty, but it legit works. Over time, my body has gotten used to the combination, and it had been conditioned so that I can almost always poop with relative ease right after I do a shot. Plus, if it just so happens that it's a painful poop, well, being high definitely eases that.

So I would recommend people try pooping while you shoot up. You'd be amazed how quickly you can physically condition your body. And it's far better than waiting 6 days before birthing a monster that leaves you a whimpering fetal ball of misery and sadness.

I’ve been using on and off for a decade. Always been highly functioning. I’ll take tolerance breaks usually twice a year. This time around hasn’t gone well..

Took a two week break oct15-nov2 (I felt terrible first 3/4 days and AMAZING by the 5th morning on first detox)..got back on, nov3-dec17, detoxed again dec17-dec23, got back on for the holidays because I felt so bad. Even after taking subs I still couldn’t eat or really get out of bed. 

I decided I was sick of this and wanted to see how long I could be clean so after a 6 day relapse from 23-29, I am here 5 days sober again. And I still feel like HELL even on the sub!! I took 32mg my first day and am down to 4mg today but god damn do I feel awful.

I used to be able to take a tolerance break and feel almost better on sub now I’m still in bed after a very short relapse/tolly break.

Anyone else experienced this? Anything else I can other than force myself to eat and get a little excerxcise.ive basically been in bed for 5 days and this is the first day I can even post on here- with subs. I felt better on the Kratom almost the one day I took it.

Anyone else had this? My mind is very foggy sorry if this doesn’t make much since. Something feels way off. Never had this before my last two detox’s or tolly breaks.

I was sleeping at least a little better, but didn't feel very rested and would wake up early and not be able to fall back asleep.  Last night I took some oxy and finally slept for a long time and woke up feeling well rested for the first time since I stopped shooting up.  I'm terrified, will I only ever be able to experience good sleep on opiates?  When will I get to a point where I can sleep well again?  I don't want to ever go back on heroin or really any opiates and I just want to know if this shitty sleep is something I'm going to have to deal with for life or if it just takes much longer to normalize than other symptoms of kicking.

He also keeps saying that he must've gotten it from when he broke his neck 25 years ago and is going to 'sue the hospitals for malpractice' and denies that he could've gotten it from stabbing himself every day for the past 10+ years, even though that's the number one fucking cause.

I just finished a 17 year run of opiate addiction. I decided to taper myself off. I was doing street ""heroin"" in Atlanta, but was really fentanyl. Kept getting drug tests positive for it, not morphine. Anyway, I went from shooting to sniffing to pharm morphine to oxycodone. Stopped at 7.5 mg of oxycodone per day, thinking remaining kick would be easy. Boy, was I wrong. It was cold turkey for 10 hard days, just as bad as if I had never tapered. Have not had an opiate in any form since then.  This was very very difficult to do and I see why so many people fail.  My advice, if you really want to get off, it looks like naltrexone detox via micro doses and ""comfort meds"" is the way to go. If you think you can use Kratom or suboxone or some substitute opiate and you are just going to go down to zero and feel great - sorry, dude, not gonna happen if you've been on the stuff for a year or more. Best tips for withdrawal - stay hydrated!! Buy some NAD! Get ready to rock and roll because its gonna be nasty for at least 5 days, then another week at least of feeling like a crazy bum. 

This all applies if you are actually an addict. If you are a lightweight wanna be or some crazy shit you might be able to do it with herbs. Good luck with that. Really. Otherwise you have to commit totally. You have to make the decision. You have to decide to be strong. Weakness will not get it. You have to decide to live and conquer because I promise you, if you are using opiates every day, you are not really living. You are a spectator to life and you deserve more.

As I mentioned, there are apparently outpatient clinics that can now provide the right meds to do it the easy way and that is ok if you can afford it. Personally, I would question them very closely before I would trust them. In the old days, I checked into several clinics that promised pain free withdrawal and it was always bullshit.

I also want to mention my hostility to the people that are posting images of syringes, dope and people kicking.

Fuck you losers. You're pathetic idiots. One day you'll grow up and realize just how stupid you really are. Unfortunately, that's how nature works with human beings.

“Grey dope” that is probably around  8/10. However, the other batch looks a little bit different. It’s still in rock form, but looks a little bit darker than my other batch. (I have pictures I posted earlier on the good grey dope I just mentioned). Whenever I do the second batch of dope I get a very strong pins and needles type rush in my extremities, especially my hands. It’s basically pretty painful in the hands. 

I’ve never really experienced any pins and needles IV’ng H. From what I recall, I’ve felt this when I shot up morphine pills. When I did IV the morphine, the pins and needles rush was enjoyable and not uncomfortable. This one was pretty uncomfortable. I felt like maybe I was having a really bad reaction and that my skin was going to start breaking out red. 

Has anyone else experienced this when they were shooting up H?
Does anyone know what causes this type of rush?

Basically I've doubled my dose. This is all well and good and as you can imagine, I'm feeling pretty fucking good.

There are however downsides to this. ATM I am able to type but when the wave hits me I cannot type lol.

I am hearing conversations/seeing things so auditory and visual hallucinations.

I periodically can't get into my phone as the facial recognition thinks I'm someone else (which I suppose technically I am). The phone is denying me access because it thinks I'm not fit to use it.

I like to read articles. Currently, I get through half the page, close my eyes, forget where I was reading and what I was reading so basically rereading half the document in a continuous loop.

My ears are ringing so I currently have tinitus.

All in all, happy days.

Sorry, pretty pointless post. Just thought I would share the Nodzzz !

Hope this is a lil better.,"   So yes, I know I wrote a long-ass story last night that was pretty much unreadable to some. Im sorry about that. I'll try to clear a little bit of it up and a little shorter version this time and not as many details and bouncing around shit. 

   So this coming February 6 years ago my pops kill yourself. And I was there the last two weeks that he was alive, and he would come into my room literally every morning about 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m. always and lay with me and tell me that I saved his life and what not and he was blessed to have me there that I saved his life but that two-week Mark him around, and he told me one day you need to go home I mean there's no reason you should be taking off work any longer you haven't got paid this last week and got lucky they paid you for the week before, so don't lose your job I'm fine I'm going to the doctor in the morning they're going to fix this and come home and rest. So I told him promise me and you know he promised me. I mean he played it off well played it off to a T. So next morning came around and we breakfast say our goodbyes it gave me $100 bill with a safe combination on it if anything ever happens just in case everything you need is in there. He swore and promised again that he was fine we had nothing to worry about. For some reason I believe them got my car and went back home.

   So it's the next morning and I just get to work about 8 a.m. we're sitting there in the warehouse just chit-chatting about the weekend and what not and thats when i get a call from my sister crying her eyes out saying he did it he did it. I feel to the ground, broken n scream. Me and my dad we're very close like I was blessed to be as close to my dad as I was because some people don't have that and some don't even have a dad. At this point Buds and beer would taking the pain away so started taking hydros then Percocets then everybody's favorite Roxy's twenties 30s and forties. Then all the way up until about a year-and-a-half ago maybe two years by now one of my buddies well if he was my real friend he would have never introduced it to me but of the lovely heroin. And it is to me down a road I never thought was even possible. Never thought I would do any of the shit anyways but it happened. But nevertheless I feel like I could have done more I should have stayed I mean I should have seen the signs but I thought he knew best.
    
    So now I wanted to start the new year of clean and sober but you know you know LOL. I was saying last night that I felt bad because I got high I made that long-ass 1 paragraph story. And then I crashed about 12:15 12:30 right after New Year. Woke up about seven thirty or 8 I couldn't sleep and then I stupid fucking thing once again very beginning of the new year and you know they say whatever you're doing on that day is what you'll be doing all year and last year it was pretty fucking spot on but I'm trying to think positive and stay positive as I can but at the same time it's all emotional and I fucking blur. But it's been right at about 11 hours almost 12 hours since I last did one lil $20 pack just to take the edge off i guess but really feel shitty about it. Because I know I'm not going to get any sleep tonight and I got work in the a.m. and for any of you that know what scaffolds are I build those in tear those down. The material can get pretty fucking heavy and it's very exhausting work climbing very high and harnesses and standing on about a inch wide Circle bar it's pretty dangerous. But I have one question a friend of mine gave me a 50 mg Trazodone do you think it would be safe to take that by now to help sleep because I know the withdrawals are coming but I don't start feeling anything until about 15 to 20 hours in. Would it be safe to take a sleeping pill thar strong and having done H earlier that day?? I just wanna be able to get a little sleep. Yes i know there should be . or , in alot of places. But i was using google talk text thing. Im not going back snd doing it all lol. Youll get it.

Be safe people, you never know what youre getting these days now that fentanyl is so common. Tolerance/experience isnt going to save you if you get a hot bag. 

If youre going to get high take precautions. Use with other people or let people around you know. Keep narcan on hand and make sure they know how to use it. Take test shots if you can, or only do 1/4 of your shot and wait to see how it hits you before you slam all of it... 

Ive heard that a lot of exchanges near me have fentanyl test kits, though i dont know how common that is elsewhere.

No one should have to die just because they want to get high...

Been on subs for a while, probably close to a year and a half and they've completely turned my life around. Like you all know idle hands is the devils playground, and ive been slacking on going to the gym which is my main hobby; just some background.

I picked up a half at like 7am this morning and did a shot. Last time i picked up was like 2 or 3 months ago, and this will be the 2nd time ive used since getting on subs. Should of just picked up a dub but it is what it is now and im not just gonna dump my shit. 

Last time it wasn't an issue really because i only had enough for a days use, but im not gonna go through this half g in the same time. So after i finish my sack (if it goes over 2 days i AM going to dispose of it), how long should i wait to start taking my subs again? 

I dont plan on chipping after this, I see nothing wrong with recreational drug use even opiates, if you can control your use, but my situation is jist me feeling guilty and gaining my family's trust back after all this time and using behind their back, even if its just for a day for two.

TLDR; 1 1/2 year sub user, have enough dope for approx. 2 days. How long after i finish the last of my shit should i wait to taking my subs again?

I get a nice chilled out evening and a great night's sleep this way.  But during the day at work when I need the relief the most I'm jittery and unwell, and all I can think about when I'm at work is when can I get off, get to the chemist, and get relief.

My management are assholes and the flexible and easy-going working environment I was promised on joining doesn't exist.  I'm also on probation because I'm still in my first 90 days of employment.

What can I do to stretch the effects of methadone out during the day?  Is there a way I can trigger the effects again, kind of like how benzos do?  I don't want foul up my urine samples for obvious reasons (I'm hoping to be eligible for more take homes at some point).

I have a prescription for venlafaxine (and I have various other antidepressants lying around).  I've heard there is a mild reaction between venlafaxine and methadone, i.e., a warning about mild, extra sedation.  I also have a prescription for omeprazole.

But I digress, my friend's TV is 4K, so is that his New Year's Resolution or mine too since I was watching it?


It's not really a priority, I'm more than happy having nothing more than 1080P on my mobile computers for the foreseeable future since I think it's a bit absured to have a 4K display on a laptop. If I ever did buy such, I wouldn't want to get something too shitty 'cuz I'd be getting it because of a task involving graphics handling or video editing. In the case of photos, I want color and shit to be on point. When it's for video, I generally only care that the contrast values are accurate enough to allow proper adjustment for visibility. Sometimes the video light is under-exposed and you the shadows obfuscate details that should have a hint of highlight.



But I've digressed, in case anybody hasn't sensed the tech-humor, that's the direction I was going because computer screens and LCD's in general have a resolution spec. For the uninitiated, resolution is just a way of saying ""it's this many pixels wide and this many pixels high."" Like a grid. Like a game of battle ship except each grid can change color and brightness. 



&nbsp;


Although one resolution is to spoil myself and get a high resolution 4K display some time after upgrading my desktop graphics board, it is not a top priority. I could close out the year with a new GPU but no new monitor. 

&nbsp;


However, one true resolution for the year is to take any money I would spend on internet porn and put it towards a game once in a while. Like today, I was looking at games similar to *Space Engineers* in the Steam store and I was like ""shit, there are a few cool games"" and the initially disappointing *No Man's Sky* is 50% off and has more favorable reviews as of late. 


So, I definitely am picking that game up. Then I saw another space game for $10 and another for just under $25 called Astroneer which a coworker recommended. 

&nbsp;

Now, I didn't' really spend a lot on internet porn this past year but let's face it, any amount of money spent on porn is money not well spent. I mean like there's plenty of free stuff out there. As for whether it's healthy, whether it's good or bad for psychological health... there's definitely some interesting physiology at work and it can relate to mood and arguably strength of will. Sometimes after going without self-pleasure for more than a couple of weeks one must take care of that. Sometimes it's beneficial to take a longer break, other times you reap no new benefits after a week or so.


&nbsp;


It is not my intention to go too deep down the rabbit hole on this one today (or shall I say, p... never mind) but I do want to elude to ideas I've had in the works. At some point I'd like to talk more about sexual health, but not just in the context of ""I'm encountering this, by the way there's a sticky mess that happens way too soon."" Essentially the things that happen after you've just gotten off opis, are in WD, or are tapering off Suboxone. 

&nbsp;

I have noticed an ""up-tick"" at any time I've gone two days or so at a lower dose of subs. I've been taking mental notes. Mostly so, with some scribbles and typed scrap notes. My journey, or this phase of my journey is not complete and so I feel it premature to share observations and advice until I see this phase through. 


The other day another member of the overall opi community, actually a couple of weeks ago or longer shared some advice on TRT (Testosterone Replacement Therapy) and how it was helpful during recovery to aide in ""drive"" and endurance for a really solid gym routine. The person mainly advised seeing a doctor as they did but did mention that some supplements have ""off the label"" benefits for T-levels. In short, it stands to be determined by a doctor whether it's even needed. I what little reading I did, I did learn that some men can grow tits if self-administer TRT. So I was reluctant to order some gel on ebay which had Russian or Cryllic lettering on the package and packets.


&nbsp;


Also, there's jsut so much room for research.... is it best to implement TRT while tapering or after tapering? Is it best to only do it while on Subs and to let the body naturally produce testosterone after adjusting to being without any opioids?


Those are some of the questions I want to answer and share the answers to. Among others. I want to optimize my own sexual health and help others through my experience. I believe that sexual health is really important to people for psychological reasons and it's a key factor to keep a woman around. Many women will tolerate a few negative aspects of a personality if the sex is really good. Or maybed you have a few minor faults but the sex makes up for it. Perhaps you have pretty decent intellectual exchanges but get snubbed due to the quality of past sexual interractiosn.


&nbsp;


Perhaps the one who got away wold have hung around longer if I wasn't beginning to use heroin (in secret) while juggling nofap. Speaking of the latter, I mean it works.. but no better than just moderation. One need's not adopt an absolute hard-liner rule but in general it helps some people to stay on track. 


* Many times that I've gotten laid it happened as a result of not jacking off for a week or longer. This is not to say I haven't gotten laid three days after, or on the same day but I would never count on cold-scoring with a stranger under such a circumstance.


* T-levels normalize or even out after a week. So there is no real benefit to nofap after a week. **This is a somewhat oft-repeated fact which I don't completely agree with.** To be fair, it's probably quite accurate on it's own but there are other hormones involved. 


I'm can't say I fully understand the endocrine system but it's basically chemicals and electrical impulses. One gland emits a compound, another gland gets the hint that ""oh we got some of this so we need to add some of that"" then perhaps the body discovers, ""woah that's too much"" and another gland is prompted to emit something to counter the other shit. Hence the reason why you can grow man-boobs if you take too much testosterone.


* Then there's the raw psychology. Not even trying to go into the territory of ""women getting deep throat-ed and choking."" To each his/her own but workers in an industry are directed to do shit they may not otherwise prefer when making love. Because it sells. What mostly doesn't work for me, is the modern ""gaping asshole"" even on a petty woman. Like, dude.. c'mon I just want some PIV action here! Maybe a good missionary angle where you see the shape of the calves at the deployment perspective for insertion/docking.




**What I mean by raw psychology**, if it's even raw in any sense... is how the body gets desensitized to natural stimuli and comes to expect variety.. or gets a false hint that you're experiencing quality time with a variety of sexual partners. Like how the act of seeking different porn is stimulating on it's own and when absent in real-life experiences tends to fuck shit up.


A mis-wiring or a re-wiring of the brain. That's what nofappers set out to reverse or address. I want to find the sweet spot and advise others as I see (provable) and feel success and gains.


&nbsp;


Now finally, I remember a while back jacking off was compared to drug addiction.... is it accurate? Well, after experiencing everyday junky life I can say it's comparable but not quite. 

Like, you can't OD on masturbation but if you do enough of it you drain out some good hormones or at least throw things out of balance. Some (I have) lose a certain spark or look of confidence. Encountering certain people in public, in business.. etc becomes a bit more difficult. Shaky. Etc.


That must be where the phrase comes from, ""that guy is a *jerk-off*. Is this because those around that person perceive a certain lack of drive, lack of cool contentedness or other for of disjointedness or lack of coordination?


Well, I've learned at least that if you take a break from jerking off and then go back after a week, any psysiological gains or success in re-establishing a good balance is not thwarted. It's like a hyperdrive. You can use it to go the distnace but then you gotta let it recharge. you can sometimes use ship's hyper-drive if it's not fully charged but you'll get a shorter degraded jump. Perhaps even run into some glitches. Further using that jump-drive between full charges will further dimminish the resources for the next jump. Sometimes it's better to let the hyper-drive charge fully before doign two jumps back-to-back when it's necessary. 

The charge will be chronically low until you take at least one solid chance to fully recharge so that levels can be managed. 


&nbsp;

So with male hormones, it's just like a space ship's jump-drive or hyper-drive. I can jump multiple times a week before my elevels are 100% but now when it's three days out and I got a lovely lady in front of me who is moderately attrative, my odds of success and following through will be diminished if I was on a masturbation derby on the days prior to the three day stint of no-fap that I would currently be on. 

Whereas, if I didn't jack off for over aw eek before the one time I jacked off three days earlier, then it'll hardly make a difference... or it should hardly make a difference if I walk into that lovely lady the day after my last ~~self-immolation~~ self-pleasure. Hell, yes a masturbation derby might be akin to self-immolation on some levels. 


In the latter case, the jump-drive had a chance to fully recharge and so it didn't take long to get the body's hormonal balance back in check afterwards. 


&nbsp;

There is so much I want to talk about but I think we should end this here so that you (the readers) can process. 




&nbsp;


#TL;DR:


Although I'm not really one for specific New Year's resoltion I want to at least take any of the minor money I might spend on porn and put it towards video games. I'm talking like $10-$20 a week at times. So right off the bat I can buy like three new games. Some are cheap, the most expensive one being $30. 



**GOAL:** As for an actual goal, I want further test waters in terms of my lowest sustainable winter dose of Suboxone. I probably won't taper off completely until Spring but I'm fine with a reasonably slow transition. I understand that lower doses of subs may translate into less ""workable hours"" a day since it would wear off after perhaps 8, 10 or 12 hours. This is not preferable on a work day in the middle of the winter.

&nbsp;


I'm also considering splitting my daily dose so that I can take it twice a day. I basically want to find the lowest effective dose... determine how long or short it lasts and determine what the minimum I can take as the second dose and would generally not want to take it too close to bed time. So at 2mg per day, maybe I take 1mg in the AM and 1mg in the late afternoon. This may also allow me to find a way to take even lower doses in a more physiologically, mostly psychologically... sustainable manner. Sustainable in that I won't be inclined to take too much more during my second dose without accurately measuring it.




in short, I'm open to options in including a water taper to get fine control over a sub taper. Then while doing that I want to emphasize sexual health. On days when I don't take a lot of sub or take a real low dose I do feel a resurgence in libido. No fap definitely does not have the same effect when I'm on my daily dose but it still helps. I'd imagine if I stopped taking subs today that after a week (assuming I don't mind the WD symptoms to much), even despite any WD symptoms I would expect some very strong sexually oriented urges. Inversely, the hot blonde milf with transparent leggings is still certainly a sight be admired but will not trigger my urges in the strong manner which was the case before I tried heroin or dope.. 



I think comparing FAP to heroin addiction cheapens the implications and effects of heroin addiction but there is some truth to the analogy. Specifically, if one is ""in-tune"" with their own body they can get a really strong pleasure spike. Hell, I think the body creates natural opioids when this happens. 



**Oh and finally ,very important**

Experiencing an orgasm with a female sexual partner as a male is not the same as just ejaculating to porn or mental images. The hormones and pheromones which are produced and interpreted by each person's body are different. Things like oxytocin aka ""the cuddle hormone"" are pretty much absent during male self-pleasure. THere's more but in short to FAP is an occasional necessity when a man's biological need for sexual intercourse remains unmet due to health, age or ugliness.",1546360836.0

Recently, I was cheated on and obviously have zero healthy coping skills, so I relapsed. The difference is, I relapsed on Opana ER’s.

I graduated HS in fucking 2007. Walked across that stage with a habit...and 6000 dollars as graduation money that would be gone in 3 weeks.

2008-2009 I fucked up my only year of college. Living in the dorms never going to class. I'm young. Theres plenty of time.

10 years later.

Motherfuckers you have to believe me. It is NOT worth it. If you can stop. Please stop.

You get to this weird state, and it took me 10 years...where there is hardly ANY high. Me and my GF recently shot 4 grams in one day. Maybe close to 5. There is no more itch. No more nods. No numbness. All that happens is the clock resets to 8 hours and counting until WD hits.

I don't even get excited about my shots any more. Sure theres always meth and crack but its hard enough with 2 bad dope habits before you add in the stims. And that shit makes girls go insane after a little while. Don't need a partner off her rocker.

Just paused to do a shot of crack. My GF has a bad 2ndary love for this bullshit. Luckily the shit she gets sucks so psychosis is rare but fuck. Its an ugly habit. She hits the pipe...twirls it to cool it. Always has to spit in a bag. She paces. Hits it again. Twirl. Spit. Pace. Looks at me.

Stop it if you can.

Plus. It seems like the epidemic is ending. Not as many junkies around like last year. Dope quality dropping. Majority of dboys terrified to sell fent. I was just locked up past summer on dope charges (sale to UC) and plead to a misd after running for 3 years. Cops want that fentanyl. They get disappointed when they test ur shit and its reg dope.

Hope you're all safe and doing alright on this new year's Eve. I've been looking on the internet for answers to this problem but can't seem to get anywhere when I look deeper. So hoping somebody with more experience can offer some advice.

I have a friend from here who I think might've been arrested. I haven't heard from them in a few days and based on the context of when we were last talking, it seems like a very possible outcome.

What I know:

\*Their first name,

\*The date and general time that it would've happened

\*The general area where it would happen (not 100% sure on the city/county, but I know where they're from and that it would be relatively close to there so I can look in a lot of different areas surrounding it)

Are there like online databases where I can search arrests by name, date, location etc? Especially if I can see pictures, since I don't know their last name that's pretty much the only way I can confirm who it is.

All I've found so far is a couple specific police department websites that list info on arrests that are made, but they aren't searchable and they don't give names (only the crime and date). Really hoping there's more I can do.

Also, assuming I can find them  then I don't even know what to do in this situation honestly. I guess I'm hoping to make sure that they're alive and well. Beyond that, I want to try to help them in whatever way that I can. I don't understand the legal system much at all and realize this could be pretty limited. I live quite far away and wouldn't be able to visit them in person but I'm not sure if there's some way I could even contact them? Or would they have to reach out to me?

Thanks everyone and have a good New year..

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Also i unfortunately don't have contact with anyone else close to them who could help me with more specific info in this situation. I know two (former?) friends of theirs but one doesn't respond to me anymore even when I asked about this. The other moved away over a year ago and hasn't talked to my friend since.

So ill start off like this, hey, Im a herion addict. Well opiate addict if to more direct about it lol. This coming Feb will mark 6 years that my dad killed himself. We was so close. 2 peas in a pod. Where ever he was i was vise versa. Always at my baseball games and basketball games during school and teaching me hunting and fishing and the way of life. Literally my best friend on earth. He was very strict and preached never give up nor in. Stand up to what you believe in. Die on your feet not your knees kinda man. I was there the last 2 weeks, i taking off work and went and stayed with him. Literally every morning he woke me up at 3 or 4 in yhr morning laying in my bed telling me i saved his life by being there. And he promised me he would never do it that he was stronger than tbat. Well after a month goes on witb no sleep and seeing doctors about it, they prescribed him sleeping med and anti depressant and he never took anytning more than pot or once in a blue moon maybe a tylenol 200mg or sometjing. He had a chemical reaction mentally to both of those and with no sleep still, he sent me home after 2 weeks with a 100 bill saying if anything rver happens ti me, safe combination was on. He swore and promise he waa goin to doc and coming hkme to tey and rest. I get a call thr next morning at work around 930isham. He done it. He done it. I broke!!!! And i broke bad!!!! Btw 28 now. I was 22 when it happened. 3 years after i been taking tons of roxys 20mg 30 40, super cheap. Perc 10's.

You have dropped dead in a few hours. I was lucky. Well my dumb ass tried H, and knew right then snd there thst was it, thatd what ive been searvjing for my whole fucking life lol right on. I swear it was like blue magic off american gangster lol fire fire. And now we are here, a lil more than 2 years later. I was 19 hours from my last pack today at 330pm. Well had a friend call and said he needed skmegning and he would buy me some since i was at home starting to actually feel it. N said i wasnt going to. Last night was my last night. Nope sure wasnt. Got high tonight. And as i sit here i cant help but think of my pops and thank, i cant even get to 2 day. Wtf. Im a h addict. Do i really even deserve it?? I mean he would be fucking disgusted with me right now literally. And of my older brother which tbh i couldnt even tell if he was alive, he off some where fucked up struggle weth a ice addiction talking about suicide and shit because he is gettiny clean and cant sleep. Idk man. I just feel useless right now ever sinc3 i used a couple hours ago. Just worthless. Sorry it was so long, but seriously trust is a BIG ISSUE NOW SINCE NY DAD LIED TO ME.

It was hoped that a thebaine-derived drug would retain the analgesic effects of morphine and heroin with less dependence. Taken orally, 20 mg of immediate release oxycodone is considered to be equivalent in analgesic effect to 30 mg of morphine,while extended release oxycodone is considered to be twice as potent as oral morphine.Oxycodone can be administered orally, intranasally, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, or rectally. The bioavailability of oral administration of oxycodone averages within a range of 60 to 87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between individuals with a mean of 46%.Oxycodone acts by activating the μ-opioid receptor.When taken by mouth, it has roughly 1.5 times the effect of the equivalent amount of morphine.In the United States the wholesale cost per dose is less than 0.30 USD as of 2018",1546310262.0

For what it's worth, how I did it:

For 2.5 days (morning and night first two days, just morning the last), I switched my MOI (I normally smoke oxy, for this ""taper"", I switched to oral) and dosed just enough to get well throughout this stage (30mg twice daily orally vs 60-120mg mg daily smoked). I don't know this physiology of it, but I wouldn't so much say this helped with much other than easing me off smoking opiates to enjoy life; I always had a theory that I was more addicted to the act of smoking than I was to the opiates... I can't confirm or deny that theory, but sitting here sober, I still believe it.

After this, I dosed 1200 mg of gabapentin twice daily for 5 days, and stayed MEGA stoned from day 1 of my oral consumption through the end of this (edibles twice daily and a dab pen all day everday; sativa from 6 am till 5 pm, indica between that).

After I ran out of that, I've been completely fine withdrawal wise. I never got higher than perhaps a 2 out of 10 for withdrawals. Couple of runny noses and sneezes, other than that, no sweats, no diarrhea, slept just fine. 

________

I went to my first NA meeting two nights ago; it made me feel good, and VERY optimistic; its the only time I can truly say I didn't feel any urge to be high again.

I know not everybody has access to gabapentin, but it did wonders for me. A buddy of mine did the same regiment, but with lyrica instead of gabapentin and reported feeling as good as I did through the process.

I don't know how to end this post gracefully, so if you read this, thank you. I really hope this can help someone. If anybody needs to talk, my DMs are always open.",1546300301.0

I know fentanyl is super strong so someone told me subutex and suboxone will not work. That methadone is the only real way to come off fentanyl with as little suffering as possible. Is this true? I've heard mixed things about kratom as well.

I was able to pick up a nice little goody bag of Suboxone, Subutex and etc from a friend but haven't been able to force myself to stay sick long enough to start my Suboxone taper...)  I didn't stop using when I was supposed to yesterday... yes I'm a weak willed selfish piece of shit. Judge all you want, i deserve it. and now I'm really pushing my luck time wise but I think I've convinced myself to ride it out since I leave in about 24 hours (YIKES).

I have a pretty good variety of stuff to help me through these withdrawals but have no real experience using these medications besides two separate occasions where I ate a Suboxone strip, both times was just to get rid of the sickness till I could pick up the next day.

Hoping you guys can give me some advice on a good taper for the Suboxone that won't leave me terribly sick and maybe some help on how to use the other meds I got to get me through the next 20 hours so I can take my first Suboxone dose without going into precipitated wd. Any insight would be greatly appreciated thank you don't wanna waste any of this or fuck myself over when there's a better way to do it.

So heres a list of what I've got:

* 3 Suboxone strips 8m   buprenorphine  2mg naloxone

* 1 Suboxone pill 8mg bup 2 mg nal

* 3 Probuphine (Subutex?) Pills 8mg Buprenorphine Hydrochloride 

* 3 Phenergan pills 25 mg Promethazine Hydrochloride (nausea)

* 3 Flexeril pills 5 mg Cyclobenzaprine Hydrochloride (muscle relaxer)

* 2 Gabapentin pills 300 mg


Really could use the advice when it comes to a good taper schedule for the subs and a good time to take the other Flexeril, Phenergan, and Gabapentin especially when it comes to helping me get through the next 18 hours before I can start the Suboxone without sending myself into precipitated wd or breaking down and using heroin... Any other tips on getting through wd that don't have to do with the stash would be awesome too. I'm all ears and already starting to get sick.... Thanks in advance for your help!

Started shooting again and used for 28 days straight. 

Anyway I stopped cold turkey again because I wanted to stop before the withdrawal got worse. Got some kratom and got through the withdrawal easily since it was only a month of using. 

It's been about 2 weeks since my last dose of opiates, but I wanted to get high as my girlfriend is out of town and I have the house to myself, obviously dope is my first choice but I'm an onion guy so couldn't get any dope or oxy which is probably a good thing since I just got over withdrawal. 

I remembered I had some pure MDMA from the onions in my safe, along with some ketamine. So figured fuck it I've never IVed either of these drugs before and I heard the rush from MDMA is euphoric as shit. 

Shot a 120mg shot of MDMA and holy fucking shit, probably the most intense rush from any drug I have put in my veins. Coke is a close second with really good blow, but this MDMA was absolutely awesome. I haven't done MDMA in a few years, I used to abuse it when I was younger and that feeling was amazing. 

I read that MDMA will destroy your veins quickly, so this is something I'm only going to do once or twice a year. The high only lasted about an hour and a half and I fell asleep last night with no problem falling asleep. 

What are your guys favorite drug to IV other than opiates?
