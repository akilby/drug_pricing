After about three hours of restless sleep, I was rudely awakened from my sweat-drenched nap by a goose called Skittles. This piece of shit bird was right outside my window, like he knows I'm in there. And he even brought his screeching friends! There were like five geese and four of the ugliest chickens I've ever seen (my host said they're guineas). I don't know which were louder. Fuck it, I get up.

After what breakfast I could stomach, I thought I might go into the garage and smoke a cigarette. Nope, little ducks live in there, in something called a brooder. Oh, and I was told there is no smoking anywhere near the birds, something about a delicate respiratory system (canary in the mine). Well, the entire house/yard/fucking compound is dedicated to these birds, so I have to exit the yard and walk out to the road/vehicle path for a smoke. Fine.

That stupid fucking goose and his ugly ass chicken friends follow me the entire time, goose trying to bite, ugly chicken screeching. At least I made it out, but I'm really not up to running away from it.

I thought an attempt at a nap would be in order, but no, said the ugly chickens. I asked my friend about them, and she said the loud one is named Pancake. So I figure that all the chickens must be collectively called Pancake, because there is no fucking way to tell them apart, and all of them are equally loud and annoying.

So fuck a nap, fuck real food, and fuck Skittles and Pancake(s). I'm going to go try to eat some fruit and ice cream at the pond with my new duck friend Snowflake. Oh, and I was informed yesterday that the fruit in the fridge was purchased for the birds, but it's cool if I have some. What the fuck?!?! Well, today is when we go to ""town"" for ""grocery day,"" so I'm gonna buy my own fruit...not for birds!

Well, maybe Snowflake. But only her. She no bite.",1525020881.0

My opiate of choice is oxycodone. I rarely take oxy by itself anymore. I ALWAYS have to take a dab or a few rips off my bong to get myself to nod. But above all would be a strong edible with oxy. Gets me fucked up out of my mind nodding hard for hours on end. I would have to say that THC + oxy is definitely my favorite combo.

Another combo that I absolutely love is a couple roxies + some blow. Gets me feeling fucking fantastic for a good chunk of time, provided I have enough blow to keep the fun rolling.

And last but not least comes the xanax/kpin/valium + oxy combo. This is another combo that will have me fucked up for hours on end, on a fat nod and I enjoy every second of it.

What opiate is everyone doing today? For me, I just washed down a shot glass that was filled with coke and a OP 60. Just starting to come up right now and feeling pretty damn good.

The long path ahead of me was dimly lit but I was walking fast. “Fate is just a word people use to brainwash others” but I was following a dream. I dreamt of a world without pain, where the rain was cool but didn’t make me sick. Where the weeks were short and we all met up for coffee once in a while. But I wasn’t ever sure who I meant to meet up with, and for all the hassle, it wasn’t worth it. 

So, I drove a lonely road, no headlights to lead the path. I dreamt a lonely dream where the sickness had grown from inside me. And I died a lonely death, one that forever will haunt me because only I can change my world, yet you did everything to save it. So, I gasped a breath of fresh air, only because you allowed it. I screamed at the pain of the Narcan in my body, flowing freshly down me like a wave of pain. You didn’t know where to put it. But there on my bicep and thigh were two perfectly placed marks signifying the desperate efforts that were made only at your expense. You were never asked into this life, and no matter how vigorously I tried to shake you off, you never backed down. And so instead of loneliness, I have a guardian angel walking beside me. Instead of darkness and soulless searching, I had the ability to fill my lungs and scream that I am alive and only through your actions I am free. 

Because of this I’m ashamed that I’m not a better human, I’m ashamed that I even tried to drive that lonely path with no one to guide me. I’m ashamed that I didn’t even bother to leave the headlights on, because sometimes the dark is more comforting. It all changed like the dawn of a new sun, I've struggled but managed to hold onto you and remember that this life isn’t meant to be driven alone. I believe that only so many dreams can get granted, and maybe I will never be able to change. I just hope that you can love me where I am.

It's where you've been going this whole time. Day one, I knew, follow the road and road one goes straight through... just like I planned. Use opiates until the day I die and until then, simply skate by. 

Road 2: I'll be flipping entirely around, not exactly sure where I will end up. What's down this path that makes it special is the man I love. This path includes sobriety. I have always, deep down under the feelings I suppress with opiates, I've truly always known that what happiness would TRULY be for me is being sober and happy with the man I love and a dog. 

Well, I got lucky. Oh I got so fucking lucky guys. I found the man of my dreams, and I could not be happier. He lives a few states away and he wants to help me get sober if it's what I want. He isn't pressuring me. But he has offered to help anyway he can. Preparing for the move, he's stocked on Kratom. He also told me he will wait until I am ready.... but moving in with him and the help of Kratom that I know works for me... maybe I can do this. I'm already trying to taper down and do my best.

I'm going fo take Road 2. I want to be with the man that loves me. And hopefully being in a brand new environment where I don't know anyone really except for the man I love and his family, with his support and my wanting to truly be sober with a happy family someday day... I think I can really do this. And I am so lucky to have met such a supportive man to love me back.

8frmqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/8frmqw/worried_about_creeping_tolerance/,7,https://redd.it/8frmqw,mister_kali,Worried about creeping tolerance.,"Some background: I had been dealing with chronic pain for a year, taking hydrocodone 5/325 as needed to deal with the pain. Disliked the high (smoke a lot of pot, do LSD now and then, Coke, once in a blue moon, K a few times, DMT twice  – no stranger to drugs) so strictly used for pain, which worked out to be 10mg once/twice a week for over a year. Never strayed from this dose since use was rarely more than a day in length and relied more heavily on CBD which was great. 

Just had hip surgery and then averaged about 30-40mg/daily of Oxy to deal with pain over a week while recovering. 

I had a small accident last night and I’m in bad pain again. I took 10mg in the middle of the night but felt that it took only about 30% of the edge off, so took another 5mg which was enough to help me be comfortable (felt more like 20mg would have been ideal).

Note that I am not expecting needing to use any pain killers long term – once I get out of the post-op period I shouldn’t have pain anymore.  

Two questions for you guys as I’m concerned with the creeping tolerance. 


- Is 15/20mg tolerance for PAIN (not to get high/nod) concerning here? Prior to hurting myself last night, I had only taken two doses over two days, and went the day prior without any and felt no ill effects. I didn’t need them at all yesterday until I got hurt. I am hoping this isn’t a serious setback and should only require 24-48hr. of maintenance. 


- Related to the above, at what point will I potentially experience withdrawal effects?


TLDR - chronic pain, used 10mg hydro about once a week to manage, tolerance never crept above that. Had surgery, a lot of pain, up to needing 15mg/20mg per dose for relief. Worried about this.",1525011909.0

He pulls to the side at the stop sign and lets me pass him and he follows  me, which I assumed. I always follow all traffic laws and we hit the main road and he follows me for almost a mile, theres now a cop in front of who the other cop on my rear must of radioed (were a bunch of parties in that neighborhood according to them, which is very likely for the area, time of year and location.) Next thing I know I got red and blues behind me and I pull over, we are actually sitting across from the police station now.

Time to mention I have 45 norco on me, and weed in several bags/containers as well at $569. I do have my med card and it was in my lock box in my trunk so that was an issue, what was an issue was my money was split into a $100 in 5 $20s on my oassanger seat as i jist flipped some pinetrees, $175 in another pile and the rest in  another. Also, the one fucking day I forgot my wallet was today.

Long story short, they definetly thought my money was fishy being 20 and it being being split around, I'm a professional lier and pulled this off very well. They first arrested me right away for driving without a liscene but told me im not neccasarily going to jail and put me between my car and one of the 2 officers, they just needed to figure out   who I was.

While between the cars they ask if I have anything illegal in the car, I then notify I have my weed and lockbox in my trunk but I'm a med card holder  and thankfully I keeo my soft copy (doctors paper work etc) in my lockbox.  I brought my lockbox with me today for the first time in months because my mom mentioned I should with how dank the bud is.(good looks on that mah)

They ask if anything else is in the car and I tell them as far as I know nope, norcos were just tossed under my front seat as i had 2 cops on me so I wasnt gonna try to turn or do any fast movements. Then they put me in the back of squad car for a few and go to get my info to see if i'm telling the truth. They've been chill with me this whole time, respectful not dickheads.

Anyways they eventually go to search my car, a few minutes kater I see the script in his hand and hes twirling it and walking around the car to me, opens the door and asks what they are, I don't deny it, tell him they're norco. He's still chill asked again if I have anything on me etc and I didn't he said we can atrip searfh you at the station and I told him no problem with that I have nothing more.

They pop the trunk, see my papers  in rhe lockbox, call their boss to make sure the soft copy waa good and left the weed there, boss saod as long as I have the doctor papers I'm good to go. Then we drive across the street to the cop shop, do booking, inventory my money and then go to a holding cell, single cell, bed toilet sink and blanket, waa geeked to have a blanket because the city over where I live didnt give me one when I was 16 and took my hoody, was cold as fuck.

At this point my charges are driving witbout a Liscenes on person and for the norco possesion if a deadly substance or drug, I cant remember the end and am to lazy to go get my paper work on the floor on the end of my bed. 

 They thankfully made the norco charge a misdemenor but could have easily made it a felony but I was chill with them, took 50mg (usually take like 150 but didnt get home to cwe the rest) so I was atleast chilled out a bit.   

Long story short, I have $569 on me and my total bond one was $200 cash the other $400, so I had to call my  mom at like 330am no clue, didnt have my glasses or a clock. Got out of there like 445am. As im getting out and getting my stuff, I notice one of the desk cops was a girl I went to school with (class of 2016) so I don't know if that helped but me and her were chill back on the day had several classes together etc.

I'm just pissed that theyre going to want me to do drug court probably, which ismt fucking cheep. Lost my reup money too bond, I'm gettimg a lawyer even thoigh its my first case. Im 99% sure the Liscene charge will get dropped but I don't feel having to do some bull shit probabtion, I swear everytime my life is going up bullshit has to happen.",1525006137.0

Any tips?

I have the syringe filled, originally it was around 40ml of water but now it's about 25ml, guess the rest evaporated while I let the spoon sit (like it sit for 15 minutes on a large spoon so lots of surface area), or didn't make it through the filter.

I put around 3mg of buprenorphine from the white subutex pill in cold water on the spoon, most of it dissolved and I crushed the rest with the plunger of the syringe until it dissolved. Filtered it twice through a clean, unused cigarette filter butt (the cotton used in cigarette butts seems superior to cotton anyways - bleached, which prevents cotton fever aka LPS/endotoxin shock, and acetylated into cellulose acetate, the way it's processed makes it filter a lot better, much smaller pore size).

I accidentally brushed the tip of the needle against the very rough metal spoon while drawing up the solution, do you think that'll do anything bad?

The Subutex pill's ingredients seem pretty safe when injected, much safer than MS/oxy pills, the only two harmful ones seem to be magnesium stearate and the other one I'll get the exact name of in a sec. Who has shot pills here before and wants to tell me about it? The solution is a little cloudy after two filtrations so idk.

We have been through w/d together on many occasions.....running to each other's room to see if either one of us had anything to silence the hurt for an hour or two. Fuck, I remember watching him go on Methadone maintenance.......coming off of it and being in hell. My dumb ass decided I could make it through it and help him at the same time. I go cop some pills and make sure I test positive so I too can be on MM. Hahaha....I just remember he and I both wishing we could die but it made it so much more bearable having my big brother there goin through the same pain as me and I him. Fuck I miss my brother right now. He's 1000 miles away and I have no way of talkin to him right now. Love you guys. Hope everyone is doing good this sentimental evening.",1524979568.0

 .yes it was the worst most  horrendous bout of the fever but im incredibly stubborn. it's time and my body, it never loses. i've healed when 95% would need hospital visits. the people who begged me to go weren't the people who break toes and get a doctor to confirm the obvious...these were stubborn weathered fuckers watching  my convulsing and my extreme fever with worried whispers ....they said they would go if it was them.....they wouldn't have probably. i was sick and I knew before doing those cottons it was a bad idea. night 2 sick. i even cooked it. nothing, i got no relief. i did get the fever.when the nausea came and the cold started creeping in, it was obvious this was a super reaction. i fought til i was exhausted. i thought I was at death avenue and knew why i've heard people being  hospitalized for this. those awesome  rare intense infections.....i was already full out in WD. swell. i contorted under 2 blankets til passing out. i woke soaking wet. 4 hours of sleep. how?  even after waking that fever still had me warm finally after  the last 2 days of bone chill WD cold. had . it was not overly hot. i was tired, enough to sleep another 5 hours. so I did. i forgot i was supposed to be dope sick. that morning  i was up for 6 hours before getting high. that morning i should have been sick ....i wasn't . that is not the first time cotton fever made my WD basically non existent. i don't know why or how, bUt it's happened enough to recognize. tthat's weird AF. ponder away. how can cotton fever make my WD go away? te fever eliminated the ice of WD, But how did I sleep? it's not always been that exhausting and I still slept and felt relief. i the fever so awful WD doesn't even compare? i don't know, but it's happened each time since i have started checking it. it's almost like this fever focuses  the  body on healing the infection and stops  registering WD symptoms . i would have been in full out WD all that time if I didn't get the fever.

I told him I have alot of trouble peeing essentially everyday but weirdly im really confident that its not something physical / too worrysome. Basically after I told him my circumstances he confirmed my suspicions. Its a very common things and its all psychiatric. in order to pee I need zero human contact, I FOR SURE need to know theres no one waiting on me, I need to be in an empty bathroom that I know will stay empty if its in public, if im stressed or anxious about anything in life \- the peeing just aint happening. Opiates or not, putting my hands in warm or cold water never seemed to do anything for me. Even when I was very young. When a good enough dose of opiates is in the mix to where im feeling good \(not even a nod dose\) \- theres a real fucking problem LOL. I didnt realize opiates give a lot of people basically a textbook case of a shy bladder for the duration of the effects, until my first time having to go pee on a nice dose and struggling so bad that after, without exaggeration, 45 minutes I gave up. I specifically gave myself that long cause I wanted to pee to make my high feel better but I wasnt gonna waste too much high time. Last night I spent 35 minutes on the toilet, alternating between sitting and standing many many time, pressing hard on my own bladder trying to express the urine like a paralyzed dog, and eventually I accomplished my first opiate urination. The pee would come out in sync with my breathe, while breathing in it stopped. while peeing it felt like it was being squeezed through a fucking pinhole. I didnt get done peeing actually, but it was like my mind said ""Alright you got enough out to where the feeling of having to pee wont be present anymore. Go enjoy your high."". I must say, Im pretty certain that pressing on my own bladder eventually did help lots.

The girl who introduced me (unknowingly) to the middle I've been dealing with gave me the number of one of her other dudes who is a direct guy; no middling; awesome right ? Well see. 

I talked to the guy at 10:28pm and he told me where to meet him but he was doing something so he'd hit me back in 20 min. Went to the area and have been chillin across the street. Sent him a text to hit me up when he was ready cuz I was in the area, he said absolutely. Awesome. 

After another 30 min I text asking for an eta, no response after 10 min so I call. He says his phone was dead and he's charging it so should be 5-10 more min, supposedly lives right behind this mcdonalds. Cool I guess even though it's been over an hour. I tell him I'll be in the lot then. 

Just got another text sayin eta is 15 min. 

Obviously I'm aware of the ol 20 mins bein 40 mins and what not but with my streak of fakes and bullshit I'm a lil nervous. 

Naturally I had 2 blues left that I took the minute I talked to dude the first Time and now I can't even enjoy em cuz I'm a ball of nerves. 

Everyone please send some well wishes my way as I wait and wait and wait that this will actually come through. 



EDIT/UPDATE: 

Turns out this ""straight connect"" is not; in fact he is another middle. This sucks because I have about 3 middles at this point and obv all I want is a straight up fucking connect; better than nothing at all though. 

Dude shows up with his dude (almost 3 hours after the first 20min) and main guy walks into wawa and other dude jumps in my car askin for the cash; hell no. He obv sees my hesitation and says I can walk in with him; obv I do. 

Guy gets his soda, has my money, pays for his drink with one of the five dollar bills I had given him. We go back outside and he says he'll jump in my car in a second; I'm immediately like god fucking damnit, dudes about to try some shit, so I back up an essentially block in his car. 

I'm watching them do the transfer and finally middle dude jumps in my car. Counts out 6 for me and he has 1 for himself. (I hadn't previously asked the price , just assumed $30 because that's what I've been paying out here) this makes me feel better because they look good and he obviously took the profits from middling the deal and got himself one. (I'm assuming they were $25, and by myself assuming $30, he was able to cop one for himself and grab a soda) 

This I honestly don't care about because he's a fucking middle; of course there's gonna be a fee. No one middles for free, I mean why would they ? I've never muddled for free, that's for damn sure. 

Anyways I'm sorry , I'm high (yay :) ) and for some reason since I've actually started posting lately instead of just lurking it somehow turns into a fucking novel. Thanks for reading this long as fuck shit post :) 

TL;DR : thought I found a new connect , turned out to be a middle , waited around for literally 3 hours being told throughout it would be 5, 15, 20 mins etc BUT successfully copped 6 blues :) already ate 2 and have 4 for tomorrow

The signs of OD are: shallow, gurgling, snoring breath, not breathing, not responding, cool clammy skin, turning blue. Also, check if nodded off. If you can't wake someone up after calling their name and doing a hard sternum rub with the knuckles, it's time for 911 ""Someone's not breathing"", rescue breathing \(no chest compressions\), and the naloxone. With the amount of fentanyl everywhere now, it's good to think about an emergency plan.

I am taking a vacation in the middle of next month. For those who have been clean longer than me, is there still a chance of experiencing PAWS this severe even after 70+ days clean? I am stressed about the fact I may end up feeling like complete shit while out on the beach next month.

Turns out the ER doctor straight up lied to me. I went to see my pain specialist yesterday morning and he said he never denied me access to care in the ER. He said he received an angry call from the ER doctor telling him he shouldn't be prescribing me anything and that I was in there faking my illness. 

So apparently the whole, ""you're under pain management and your new contract for all his patient's states emergency care is off the table"" rant by the ER doctor was an entire lie.

Someone who had seen me for less than 5 minutes made the determination I was lying and then called my regular doctors to tell them I was in there lying. Apparently, according to my pain specialist, he doesn't recommend I ever go back to that hospital again because the note is so severe he doesn't think I'll ever get adequate treatment again.

I have been dabbling in drugs for the past couple years, I have tried (in order of use frequency) weed, speed, benzos, acid, vics, dmt, mdma, cocaine, shrooms, meth, methadone and an oxy. Almost got addicted to stims, but managed to quit as soon as I saw the glimpse of the hole that was just beneath my feet.


In the past 9 months or so I haven't used pretty much at all except maybe weed a couple times a week, benzos and vics once in a while.


So a couple weeks ago I got my hands on a bunch of xans and my barred out retarded self decided to order a gram of heroin because hey oxies and heroin are basically the same thing except one is much cheaper right?


So it arrives and as soon as I took a good look at the baggie I got this intense feeling of fear like something really bad is about to happen and I decided to put it away and sleep on it.


The baggie is sitting on my shelf right now. I pick it up once in a while, look at it, feel it, smell it, and put it back down. I can't stop thinking about it. I want to snort a tiny bit and see how it feels. I want to flush it down the drain, but I spent good money on it. I have good friends who have been struggling with addiction for years and read many stories on Reddit and many other sites.


I apologise for this weird post but I just want to get this off my mind and hopefully have someone give me their perspective.

But say you don't have the strips on hand, you've gotten your baggie from a popular vendor with great reviews and supposedly never cuts (I know I know, you can't fully trust a stranger online but just take this into consideration), and you're itching to spend your Saturday nodding out while watching documentaries, playing video games, or whatever you fancy.

Now for my *theoretical* question: Say there was accidentally a tiny bit of fent/fentalog in your bag you believed was pure H and you consumed a tiny *tiny* spec up your nose, would you automatically *fatally* overdose if you were snorting really small bumps (like pencil tip bumps)? Or would you just get a quick and sudden nod?

I wish the opiate scene wasn't plagued with this shit. Thanks to Chinese labs and BigPharma people are fucking dying like flies and it pisses me off. I suffer anxiety and chronic pain (no, I am not using H to treat myself, it's a nice treat I buy myself every few years) so before I take each bump I get a little anxious and have 91- ready on my phone where I just need to press another 1 and it'll contact emergency services.",1524927122.0

Anyone have any advice on how to fix this or at least somewhat remedy it. Have tried ginger tea but that doesn't really help, also drank some milk to kinda try and settle my stomach but similarly the nausea isn't at all lowered.

First and foremost, in case any of you are in a ""struggle"", or you're feeling down or ANYTHING, I just want to let you know that you truly are a beautiful being. People are people, and we have all made mistakes that we wish we could take back - that doesn't take away how special you really are!

But you really have to think of your life as a book. Your life is YOUR book, it's made specifically and only for you. And whoever you may be jealous of at the time, someone you went to school with or whoever you think has it better than you or doing better, they are not the hero of your book!

You know who the hero of your book is??...It's you!

 You're all smart - like come on how many clever ways have we all concocted to get high haha! Feel free to comment some funny/desperate cop stories - I enjoy reading those, but I digress.

I am incredibly happy right now and I hope you all are doing well. If you aren't doing well, talk to me honestly! I'm so good at talking with people and I'm so A-OK with being there for anyone - listen to me, I will be your friend. I haven't used in about 1.5 months. I had my last University class today and it was very emotional tbh, and I'm just so happy I finally graduated and I can now get my big boy job started and begin racking in huge amounts of money as I have minimal loans because I worked throughout school. I did however pickup some roxy's 60 15mg! My tolerance is so low it's blown me out the water and I forgot how much euphoria you get from these because I've been doing oxymorphone but man oh man do I fucking love me a roxy. Earlier I did 1 15mg and yaked like instantly haha! but it felt soooo good ugh. Currently on 45mg roxy, 1mg xan, drinking some michelob ultra and I am figgity figgity fucked up and havent felt like this in soooo long ugh! It's so nice.

Love you guys, I hope you all have good things coming your way - and I promise you they are, I promise! If you're down, keep your head up - because you're all strong people. 

PEACE OUT,

I abused weed for 5 years straight everyday non stop chronic smoking, blunts, bongs, pipes, joints. I wish I can go back and save my lungs from the emphysema I have now, and my damaged heart that gets poor oxygen now. Just when life was getting better and I got my Weedtube channel up on YouTube, a trip to the ER and the results shattered my world. I can no longer smoke as much for my subscribers and I am very depressed and broken right now. I ruined my health because I wanted to feel better in life because I loved life, but all that abuse only shortened my dear life. Please remember guys that opiates can destroy your heart muscle and worst, you may never wake again from too much of the escape you want. If you guys would like to check out my channel it’s the same as my user on here. One life to live and one body only to use. Peace everyone, take care 

Add on: 
I’ve had my share of abusing opioids and benzos I’m ashamed of that I didn’t mention. My heart stopped beating one time when I had a period of abusing Xanax. One night I took a total of ten 2mg Xanax and I was out cold and didn’t respond to anyone. I was told by paramedics that my blood toxicity level was so high that my heart shut down, that definitely damaged my heart. All this happened one year ago January 2017 and since that day I’ve had shortness of breath and irregular heart palpitations. Before the issue with benzos I only used cannabis and dropped lsd twice. I started with opiates in September 2016 and I fell in love with oxy. My first time taking oxy it was great, until I foolishly took another 30mg after my first dose of 15mg, so dumb and if I get hate for it I deserve it. But that overdose was a life death experience for me, I kept nodding but it was a painful nod, my heart struggled to beat to stay alive, I was able to feel how slow it was beating and I had to keep myself awake or I knew i was going to die. Everytime I puked my vision got more yellow and yellow like a camera filter. No doubt, all these drugs have taken a toll on my life. I’ve been very emotional and I just want everyone to take care of themselves. Once your two pretty important organs of the lungs and heart doesn’t function to 100% does one realize that it’s too late. No one really expects Asians to have these types of problems but everyone of all types lives unique lives. So please, my friends, I wish you all good health and care. Live wisely so you don’t have to struggle with health. Everyone is living to die, but don’t make it a struggle to survive with a few bad choices. 💟☮️☯️",1524885385.0

Today i get 10x80mg of oxy in my hands, so at 1:15am i took 20mg sniff, 20 mins later i stopped feeling pain, i was relaxed and decided to do 10mg orally, then 30mg sniff in next 45 mins, but
1) i did really high dose but i didnt feel warm body, this beautiful codeine feeling, i felt weird with being on quite different high.
2) it wasnt very strong at all, i had problems reading and writing while opening both eyes 

what i did wrong, i crushed the 3/4 of pill and tried to safely take it, it was a nice experience but i wanted more from such a potent opiate, eh

should i do it only orally/only sniff? in one dose?
and most important how much 500mg of codeine equals to oxy, thanks in advance. love 💕

Not a frequent user of anything other than weed and alcohol, but a friend cleaned out her medicine cabinet and gave me some hydrocodone and codeine in a few forms. Only problem is that I don't think I have enough of any particular variety to get anywhere, so I'm looking at how to mix them safely. 

I tried using the conversion charts and whatnot in the sidebar but I couldn't quite figure it out. I know from previous experiences with hydros that about 10\-15mg of hydrocodone was a good dose for me so I was trying to find an equivalent amount of codeine.

Currently, I have:

1. One 5mg hydrocodone
2. 5x15mg Codeine and Acetaminophen pills
3. 75ml of Codeine/promethazine cough syrup. If I'm reading the label correctly, it's 10mg per 5ml.

I have tried the codeine pills before, and even taking 5 of them I didn't feel much, and from past experience I know that a single hydro won't get me very far. 

All that said, if I want to get nice and stoned but still stay safe, what mix should I be taking?",1524876090.0

Through The Looking Glass is a very rare and (previously) hard to find LP released in 1983 by the experimental Japanese percussionist Midori Takada. Due to a low number of original presses of the LP, and no rereleases on tape, CD, or in digital format drove the cost of a good condition original vinyl LP up to over $1,000. Thanks to a reissue in the last year or so, the average John and Jane Q. Public can own a new LP of this incredible masterpiece for a reasonable price.

It's definitely abstract, and borders on avante garde, but if you have 45 minutes to sit still in a comfortable chair and listen to the the entirety of the album with a solid nod then I highly recommend it. Luckily some kind soul has uploaded a vinyl rip to Youtube, so all people can experience what is one of the best albums I have heard in recent memory. ",1524866028.0

I’ve seen him do a couple drops behind our house near the trash cans (he’s not slick at all) and a few times next to our fence. I’ve never fucked with the drops or with him, he looks like a one man operation. Yesterday my girl saw him put something into a hole in the side of our house and told me about it. It was gone by the time I checked. 

Anyway this is getting a little outta hand and I’m gonna talk to him. I wanna let him know that 
A) I don’t care what he’s doing and he can do his thing all day long and I’m not gonna say or do shit about it...and
B) I don’t want him using my house or fence as a drop

I have no desire to holler at him for any product, I’m a solid believer in not shitting where I sleep. I don’t want him knocking on my door or anything.

So my dude was gonna see his people yesterday and try and make everything right. At this point he had given me 2 legit ones over 2 days (this happened Monday night-the fakes). I text dude around 3 yesterday and he's in the city at a doc appt and says he's meeting with his people up there and will hit me back once he's back in town; all good. 

I'm at work and it's about 830pm with no word from him so I step outside for a quick smoke and decide to call him. Dude picks up and says he's got good news & bad news. Good news is he got a little of his money back and got some new ones. Bad news is he can only give me 1/2 my money back cuz he lost 1/2 his. I tell him no prob I understand (I'm happy to get anything back at this point). I say since I technically still owe him for the 1 from the other day just give me 2 of the blues and I'll buy 2 and well call it a day. He's cool with this and says he'll meet me at my job when I'm off (another girl I work with gets shit from him too). 

Dude shows up but were still workin so I grab her cash and run out real quick. Obviously it's dark out when I get into his car and I see an Oxy 10 (pink) sitting on his middle consule and immediately I'm relieved because even if the blues are fakes no one presses 10s right ?! Dead fuckin wrong.

Of course I don't know this yet, I don't take time to look at the 10s because clearly I'm a fuckin idiot and immediately buy 7. Dude then hands me 2 of the 30s he owes me, and this time I look at them. Halfway decent looking m boxes but obv fakes. I knew when I looked at them something was off. Overall the press was impressive (haha) it had a shine/sheen (?) to it but I've don't plenty of m boxes in my day and they've always been more chalky. I take the 2 on the off chance they're real by some jj miracle but tell him I don't think they're legit but I'll double check just to be sure. Get the other girl hers and go back into work. 

I tell the girl I don't think these are legit but I could be wrong and she says oh fuck this were gonna find out right now (she snorts, I eat, so she goes into the bathroom ) 

She comes out heated af, fuckin fakes again. I go into the bathroom and decide to look at the 10s, they don't look right big seriously who in tf spends the time and energy to fake 10s?! Someone apparently because as soon as I put them in my mouth and chew I know these are fakes. I'm beyond fuckin livid, I gotta give this girl a ride home and she calls dude and bitches him out. I text him asking to meet after I drop her off, he says to call him. 

I drop this girl off and call dude, he's 30 mins away but will come return my money when he's back. In the mean time I try one person who I've dealt with a few times here they just never ever answer (older lady-story for another day) naturally ive tried calling her already multiple times today because at this point I only wanna deal with her (her shit has been on point everytime ) of course this time , while I'm waiting on a refund she answers and says she had a few left but I gotta get there within the hour, of course I say no prob because I want those last ones. 

At this point I'm freaking out, I can get some but I need my money because obv I just spent it all again. 

I call dude and explain I found some real ones, and she's out in the area he's in and wonder if I can come meet him. He's not thrilled but says I can meet him out that way, just not where he is. 

I drive out and call him about 6x and he's obviously annoyed but I apologize and say I'm just freaking out, I'm starting to withdrawl and I need to get moving. 

This has turned into a longer story than I intended lol but anyways dude actually shows up and gives me $100 total. $60 refund on the 2 blues, I had previously gotten 2 30mg Addie's which ran me $30, tried to 'return' those but he said just keep em and gave me an additional $30 and I just straight up asked him to borrow $10 cuz that would get me what I need and he does. And on top of this his ACTUAL script of 5s, he had 7 left and just gave them to me.

All in all I'm still out some money but dude did help me out in returning my shit last night and not givin me the run around. I honestly kinda feel bad for the dude gettin screwed 2x but he obv doesn't know enough about this because he doesn't do em. ",1524842653.0

Fucked it all up last week over some dumb shit—literally my favourite 24 hour diner closed at like 2AM for a computer system upgrade or something—and I just kinda lost it over not being able to chill at my usual spot after work (I’m a server elsewhere) and went home and hit the tin foil like the piece of shit human I am.

Even though my problem is really not all that bad quite yet at the moment, I’ve done this enough to know what happens next and I really don’t want it to get there. I know that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting different results, and that’s kinda what it feels like tryna stay clean on my own.

So like a dumbass I called my doctors office and said I wanted to make an appointment cause I need help with my drug problem. I never wanted any of this bullshit to be in my medical records or what have you but I’m at a point where I’m just so sick of this bullshit, maybe getting outside help is worth a shot. The appointment is tomorrow and I’m really regretting having made it. I only have health insurance for another month or so as well because my 26th birthday is pretty soon.

Was I being stupid having made such an appointment? Should I bail and not go? What is my doctor even gonna make me do? Am I gonna have to take a drug test and if so will they make me go to rehab? Cause I don’t think that’s nescessary. I can get clean whenever I want, I just need to figure out how to stay clean. It’s just a really frustrating situation, given that I’ve generally been a very functional addict. Tbh it’s the mental side of all this that’s really been wearing me down lately.

I waited 4 hours in the ER waiting room followed by 1hour in the back in the worst pain I've had in a long time now. I had vomited  roughly 6 times in a 3 hour period and was beyond shaky/ill. Quite frankly I'm still ill. 

Finally, I'm seen by an ER doctor who says he needs to talk to my new pain management specialist before he'll administer any pain medication. An hour goes by and I've left two voicemails myself for this specialist and haven't heard back another hour goes by still nothing I leave another voicemail. Then 30 minutes go by and the ER doctor comes in to tell me that my pain specialist is denying me access to care in the ER. I sob quietly and squirm. I'm in the worst pain of my life and things have just gotten worse because I can't get any relief. I leave another 2 voicemails for my doctor - still no reponse.

So, I call and try to get through to one of his associates who is quite rude to me. I explain the situation and he was like ""what do you want me to do about it? You're already at the ER."" I ask him to clarify my contract for me, afterall, there in the same clinic and he flat out tells me he wont do that and was very condescending.

I cry. 

I ask to be discharged. They take over an hour getting me discharged. I cry more. I get home, sleep for 45 minutes and now I'm up in tears and pain and oh so angry. 

I didnt ask for this. I didn't ask to get sick. I didn't ask to require aroud the clock pain medication. I didn't ask to go to the ER. I don't abuse my situation - at least I haven't in over 8 months. Right now I just want to die it's so bad.  IDK how I'm gonna make it till 8am to show up at his office early and get some answers, but I'm gonna have to.

Her current is morphine 60mg/2x a day and percocet 10mg/3x a day. She went to the doctor a few days ago and the doctor said that the D.E.A is saying that people can only have 90mg a day of morphine and cut her down to 50mg/2x a day but with prior authorizations and such she has yet to be able to pick it up and not even sure if she will be able to period and she lives entirely on benefits. So my question to you guys is... Is this legit? Can the DEA say how much a person can have? She gets bad with drawls if she doesnt have the right amount of meds and now shes having to take more of the percocet since she does not have the morphine.

The other one is off in college. I'm probably your best friends mother. Stay the fuck out of my medicine cabinet! \(Just kidding you'll only find trazadone have at it\)

I'm pretty sick of my son smoking pot in his bedroom all day and all night and I don't know why he can't just go to the shed or out back like a normal kid? And it's always the same excuse. 'I was scraping my bowl and you have to heat it with a lighter before you scrape it. I wasn't smoking just chill.' My response: 'What does that have to do with the price of fish in China?' Him: What does that even mean?' Me: 'Quit smoking shit in my fucking house'

My daughter is a senior and I can't wait until she goes to college. All she does is play on her phone and roll her eyes at me. I don't even know what she does on her phone because I'm pretty sure she communicates in grunts and moans. I am pretty sure when she stomps her feet and slams my fucking doors she's upset though. I don't know if she's a work in progress or a product of my parenting. 

My oldest one is in college. He's definitely my favorite. He's the smart one. Always took his pot outside. Wasn't sneaky about it but didn't throw it in my face like his brother. Never had homemade bongs and popcan bowls strewn about his room or empty beer bottles. At this point he's getting everything when I die.

Back in the day, I was doing dope (heroin) pretty much every day from June 4-September 5 2017, and finally quit around that time for about a month until mid October when some stressors with my gf led me to another relapse (I legit thought she ODd and it drove me back to the needle...she ended up being alive tho) and we had been using together while she was detoxing from xanax at my house. That ended after she left and went back home...at least for me it did. Long story short, we started seeing eachother again in February and thats when I found out that she had ended up getting addicted to heroin, not just smoking trays with me while we chilled, but legit shooting up multiple times a day just as I had used to, withdrawl symptoms and everything. The whole situation really freaked me out and I have just been trying to help her get off of dope for the last couple months, thinking at first she actually wanted to quit. Turns out she didn't (now she does, but not then) and was considering doing some pretty regrettable stuff for money just to get dope so she wouldnt be sick. At that time the Zubsolvs I would give her didnt help as they didnt get her high so she wanted nothing to do with them at the time. Thinking of what I could do to help her avoid getting into the situation she was thinking about doing for money, I had weighed the costs and risks associated with it all and decided that helping her buy dope this one time would be worth the risk of my own sobriety so long as it meant she didn't get hurt again. Of course, that isnt how it played out. I still had rigs at home cause during our breakup period I would shoot meth from time to time, and still hadnt gotten rid of them. She had dope that I had paid for, so I figured what the hell, I'll give it a little taste again (this was around March 20th or so I believe) and it didnt end there. I started picking up with her and we were full-out junkie couple again, and it never really bothered me. In the meantime, I talked with my parents about getting her help, as I had talked with her, and we all came to an agreement that she would at least try getting treatment the right way with a suboxone script just as I had. Eventually I got caught, not gonna go into detail as to how, but my parents and I threw out all my parafanalia on April 17 following my last shot which I had done the night before. I haven't used again since, because I have a Zubsolv prescription that allows me to not be sick. My girl on the other hand does not, not until May 2nd at least. Shes still been using but is committed to trying to get treatment, and she called the doc to set up an appointment the other day which I am very proud of her for. Shes still using in the meantime, but I haven't smoked shot snorted or injested heroin of any kind since April 17th. However, last night we were chilling and she smoked some weed, to which I had none since I still had to drive her home. All day long she was mentioning how my pupils had been pins, to which I brushed off cause I knew such info was irrelevant at best and a little strange/sus at worst. Problem is, she also claimed I looked high, and that I never looked that way except the times when we did heroin together. On the way driving her home last night, we talked about it and the only explaination I had for why my pupils were so small was ""I honestly have no idea, theyre just kinda like that,"" which I followed up by agreeing with her suspicions about me. She ended up asking me if I was using again, telling me to just tell her if I was. Problem is, I'm not doing it! I haven't done dope in almost 10 days and thats what I told her but she refused to believe me and I admit I was acting hella guilty cause naturally I'm a terrible liar which doesnt help, especially when I'm telling the truth. I just didnt want her to think I betrayed her like that and used behind her back. I legit want help for both of us so we can move on and live a happy life without this heroin bullshit but she admittedly has been having problems trusting me lately which I deserve as I've lied to her so many times in the past. However, I dont wanna do that anymore. No more dope, no more lying, none of the shit that fucks up the best relationship I've ever had with a girl. I havent really had much time to proove this to her but its just really been bothering me that she still thinks I'm lying when I'm not. I'm stubborn as fuck and so is she so I wouldn't ever admit guilt to something I didn't do. I showed her that my tracks were gone, just scars now, no new red dots. Still didnt help. She got out of the car telling me it was my last chance to admit it or that there would be hell to pay but I still told her the truth, that I didnt use since the 17th. Honestly, idk what to do here guys, I just gotta earn her trust back but in the meantime I want to proove that I didnt use yesterday like she thinks I did so she at least knows she can trust that I'm fully committed to getting both of us clean together. This isnt about one upmanship or prooving that she was wrong to laugh in her face, I'd never do that immature bullshit. I just want her to know she can trust me on this and that I have her back.

TL;DR: Girlfriend got stoned last night and noticed my pupils were pinned, assumed I had been using behind her back while shes tryin to get clean. I didnt, but no matter what I say she doesnt beleive me...what do I do?",1524778637.0

Well, incredibly, I didn't do anything but weed for about two weeks until last night, when I took approximately 350 mgs of codeine, my usual being around 230 - 300. 

My tolerance must have really dropped, because Jesus, I was damn near falling asleep in the movie theatre when out of nowhere I was itching like never before, and boom, next thing I know I'm nauseous as shit and struggling like mad not to throw up. I'm sweating, dizzy as fuck with everything spinning, and for some strange reason, have a very intense, near unbearable pain in my pelvis. Inconveniently, the drug was also numbing said pain to the point where, despite being extremely (ergo, too) aware of its existence, I had no way of figuring out what sort of pain it actually was.

Somehow I managed to sit through till the end of the movie restless as fuck, and as soon as that was over I stood up and, to my shock, successfully made my way over to the bathroom.

So I'm in this stall with the same horrible symptoms, and man, I swear I thought I was meeting my maker. Tried to take a piss to get rid of the pelvic pain, didn't help. Literally started stripping and all right then and there in an attempt to cool myself and not fucking faint. I was having a hard time breathing, my chest felt suppressed and I felt like I could barely function.

The cinema was closing so I had to leave, and fuckin hell, even though the fresh air definitely did feel good, staggering around in await of my drive was fucking hard. It was like being drunk, just worse, because I felt even more unaware and disconnected from the world. Everything was just a darn mess. I remember my eyes being real red when I looked in the mirror.

Thankfully, I started feeling better soon, and all this likely lasted about thirty to forty five minutes. Gotta say though, I was still high as fuck six hours after dosing, and it took me about 18 hours to fully get sober. I've barely gotten up all day today, threw up a little too and still pretty nauseous, just very weak.

Just gonna point out, I know panic attacks quite well, and this, well I can tell ya mates it wasn't one.

Had almost 2 years off of this junk and fell victim to it once again. It's sick how your mind will still continue to play tricks on you even after being away from opiates for so long.

I got into a new career where I had an opportunity to make basically as much money as I wanted (sales) that I was actually good at. After a bad day, I decided to get high. I mean i deserved it, right? I was making more money, had a good bit saved to put towards a house,  and most importantly it had been almost 2 fucking years -- I earned this dope. I decided to ""reward"" myself; what better way to feel better on a bad day?

This was only about 2 and a half months ago. In that short span I've lost just about everything I earned in my sobriety. My savings is damn near gone, no job, and back at home (thankfully I could come back here). I'm thankful that I have a mother who is willing to support me and try to help any way she can and I have my fiance who will do the same but this fucking shit has taken me over mentally once again. I can't get past the 48 hour mark. I'm trying with kratom, weed, and some beer but once I get to day 2 I'm mentally fucked. I always cave and cop. I even AMA'd out a detox and copped. That was a week ago and I've made it to day 2 twice since but again, I cave. 

What I thought was going to be easy kick is turning out to be a nightmare. Hoping on some subs today to hopefully make it easier but that's still in the air as of now. Now I'm stuck with the thought of ""Am I really even ready?"" I haven't gone back to banging it yet but I can feel the urge getting stronger and stronger for it every day. If I continue down this path I'm going to lose my fiance and the few things I have left, but that's the terrifying part; it still makes me unsure if I'm ready to stop. It's terrifying how strong of a grip this drug has on your mind.

There's really no point to my post other than to just put it out there in hopes I'll feel some kind of relief or some fucking moment of clarity bullshit.

So, the week of 4/20, I took about 25 mg of some 5/325 hydros one day, stupidly enough took another 20mg on the Friday of 4/20, drank a bit of alcohol, and that was that. That night I was nauseous as a motherf*cker, and definitely learned my lesson. 

Over the next couple days, I noticed I was a bit out of it, *lack of an appetite*, and continued to get more *anxious* and *depressed* as the week progressed. 

Come Tuesday night, a bit sleep deprived from the previous day, I was sitting down eating dinner. **Then all hell broke loose**, I suddenly got cold sweats, hyper ventilated to the point of passing out, vertigo to the point where I couldn't walk/stand and had an insane blood pressure reading for someone my age.

Ended up going to the ER, where I was given some nausea meds, and some stuff for vertigo, as they had no idea what was going on.

Someone did mention to me, that I may be going through withdrawls? Is that even possible with a weekend of heavy use?

I'd love to hear some insight!

I usually use dope but recently I found a new plug in my area (I was previously driving more than an hour each way to pick up dope because I didn’t have a plug anywhere near me).

The only thing is, this new plug of mine only has oxy, not dope. And seeing as I’m not too familiar with roxy and am always paranoid about fake pills I was wondering if you all would be so kind as to help me identify if these are real or fake.

The lighting was a little bit difficult to get right so I took multiple pictures of the front and back as well as one of the side of one of the pills.

**Please note that although it may look like some of the markings are very light, it’s just the camera lighting.** Also there are some little bluish specks throughout each of the pills in case you can’t see (which I believe are supposed to be there, so I think that’s a good sign). Finally, you may notice a crack in the side of the pill that I took a picture of. It didn’t come like that, that happened by accident after it was purchased.

I can truly state that more than any other substance opioids amplify the experience of cigarettes for me. They are 50x better.

But now that I've been getting sober (and this isn't new, as every time I would withdraw for a few days in my cycles the same thing occurred); I literally haven't smoked a single cigarette. I noticed that when my dependence was increasing, withdrawals in my weekly binge cycle were getting worse, that I wasn't smoking anymore on rebound/off days. But I would smoke like a chimney when high.

I didn't attribute this to anything other than feeling like shit, but over time the result was that I didn't touch nicotine when I was rebounding. It just wasn't enjoyable. And it still isn't! Compared to the smooth, wholesome experience of cigarettes on opioids; smoking them sober is coarse, acrid and irritating.

I literally have zero drive to go get cigarettes. It's just lost its appeal.

Saturday I'm getting fentanyl sold as heroin. I don't care that it's fentanyl. How should I go about snorting it in order to not die.,"Title says it all. I know it's fentanyl. I'm going to see if I can be with me friend who's been doing it for ages now. It's coming in bag form. I want to do it with my friend a.) so she knows how much to cut up for my first line and b.) as a safety net in case I fall out. I've never gotten high off fentanyl. I've always imagined it sucks. I've done the patches twice, but that was almost 10 years ago from the first time when I did it bucally with a tiny, tiny piece that didn't do shit. The second time I just slapped it on my arm and wore it for 3 days so I wouldn't get dope sick. I didn't get high yet again. I just felt normal.. 

If I can't be with my friend, how should I go about snorting it? Are the effects nice and how do they compare?

Overall, I feel fine. I’m just very tired. Months ago I could get out of bed in the morning with little effort but now it feels like I’m missing out on 2-3 hours of sleep and I need to drag myself to work. By the afternoon I’m feeling significantly better but I’m still extremely weak. My arms feel like they have zero muscle, and every day after work I’m capable of doing my usual 8-10 mile walk, but my legs are heavy and it takes significantly more effort to simply get from A to B, and by the time I get home I want to do nothing but sit on the couch and rest. 

I feel 110% normal the mornings after using, but I also sleep for like 14 hours. I’m a very low level addict... we’re talking about 240mg of DHC spread out over a 6-10 hour period on Saturdays, and just one 150mg dosage of codeine on a Friday night.

Is my current usage keeping me in a permanent state of PAWS? Can anyone relate to this? I have no withdrawal symptoms except for weakness, otherwise I’m normal. I know what withdrawal feels like and this definitely isn’t it. The only other thing I can think of is I have removed diphenhydramine from my life entirely because I’ve been addicted to it for years to sleep, so I switched to promethazine which I’m attempting to taper down from. I still get 8-10 hours of sleep a night. (I tried to quit sleeping pills permanently WHILE withdrawaling last. Don't do that. It's hell)",1524735847.0

I’ve been a long time lurker here in this subreddit and I love how there is zero judgement and how you take care of each other!

I live in Germany and work in a homeless shelter, so from time to time I have contact with opiates users. Two years ago I read an article in the newspapers about the whole opiate crisis in the US and how it is killing so many people. I mean I was familiar with the fact that people die from opiate abuse but in Germany there aren’t so many as we have different programs to help people and most importantly health insurance. So the whole getting hooked on Oxy or other pain meds isn’t really common. If you have pain mostly you get offered other medical help or get ibuprofen. ANYWAY. 

I’m in the US right now for vacation and have been traveling mostly in Cali, but I’ve been to Arizona too. It’s my second time in the US and last time I’ve been here in 2013 I noticed homeless people and drug using people, but this time it shocked me. 
I just find it find it mind blowing ( in a bad meaning) that there are so many people suffering and there seems to be so little help for those people in need. I mean I’m used to the German “standards” but back there it is already infuriating for me how little the government does for the people and how being homeless makes you ill (psychically and mentally). It seems like here it is even worse and people going crazy on the streets. Today I saw a women on the bus injecting herself in the foot and she couldn’t find a vein for some time and the bus going fast and then stopping again and so on. I felt her pain even though I never tried opiates but because I’ve seen it here and at work. 

So you are probably wondering what the point of this post is. Well, it’s kind of a deep question and you probably can’t answer it in one second but are there programs (needle exchange, free
Meds for HIV/Hep C, assisted living etc.) which help people in need and can you actually get off the streets? 

Thanks for reading!

Stay safe and stay strong!

So when i was able to get my hands on a bunch of oxycodone tablets i was obviously thrilled for my first real experience with opiates as this class of chemicals is depicted as pure joy.
offcourse i started slowly, taking a normal recreational dose on an empty stomach and as i felt the effects come on my dissapointment started to grow.

after an hour with tiny pupils but not much else i thought:""maybe at an higher dose i'll feel it"".
however as i snorted myself to a dose that would put most people in a coma i still felt nothing except for an intense itch.
at that moment i gave up on oxy's and convinced myself that it just wasnt strong enough for me.

so after a few years i got my hands on some H that i would try with a friend,this should be the best feeling ever right?
after a couple of lines we both started to feel it. He was in intense bliss and i was just extremely itchy and a bit tired. as the evening went on we both redosed a couple off times, at the end i took about tripple as much as him but i still never really felt it.

to be sure it did actually worked we both tested our bp and heartrate and counted how fast the other was breathing and while this changed with my friend, mine stayed virtually the same.
i also tried a small pain test by pinching myself and my friend, and while there was no change in my pain perception he couldnt feel anything.

so here's my question, why dont opiates like me? 
also, unrelated question, is showering with H nice?

tl;dr dont feel jack shit from most opiates except an itch and small pupils, why?",1524687080.0

I really want to use tonight but I’m scared about him kicking me out. I’ll still test positive for oxy but as long as I have subs in my system I can tell him I tried to get high but didn’t work.

Smoking it on foil doesn't work very well for me. The high is lackluster and I feel like I waste quite a bit:

I need 70-200mg to get high depending on quality. Smoking 100mg+ of heroin takes me *forever* and this results in a shitty high. For those that don't know, with smoking you don't get the whole dose at once, you put it on foil and chase it around with a lighter and inhale the fumes through a tube. One run on the foil gets me like 5-15mg or so, and then there is like 30 seconds while I exhale/inhale before the next run. So I end up getting the whole 100mg dose into me 5-15mg at a time, over the course of like 30-60 minutes, instead of getting the whole thing at once like I do with snorting. As a result the high kinda sucks. I don't know if I'm doing it wrong or something. A lot of people tell me smoking is awesome because you sort of get a rush -- how is this even possible when you consume your dose one tiny inhalation at a time?

I also find it impossible to find a tube of the right size to use, and because of this I often end up missing a good amount of the smoke. I've tried regular drinking straws, really thick drinking straws, pens, and tubes of foil.

I have only one love now, and she always loves me back harder than anyone ever could, until she doesn’t. This is for you, heroin. You became by one and only, and without you I’m lost. You took everything I had and replaced with with empty bliss. I met you in adolescent ignorance, and it was love at first sight. Our first night together was the best I’ve ever felt, and nothing else mattered in the world. After you left, that feeling didn’t fade. Nothing else mattered in the world. 

Staring at the ceiling at three in the morning, sweating and shaking, nothing else mattered. I’ve tried so many times to move on, but there’s something about that careless bliss that keeps drawing me back. And it’s how I feel when you’re gone that keeps the cycling going, empty and void of happiness. I can always fall back to you, and you’re always there. You forgive me despite my attempts to be rid of your warm embrace, and let me once again drift away in your arms. 

This isn’t a goodbye letter, quite the opposite. You’re gone now but you know I’ll be back. I sit here alone in my car, cigarette burning, bass thumping, thinking about you. Dreading the next time we meet. I know it won’t be long. I can try all I want but you know I’ll be back. I sit here alone surrounded by those who still care, those who haven’t given up on me, and I just wish they would. All I need is the smallest excuse and I’ll crawl back to you, knowing what lies ahead. My family begs me to stop, my little brother searching my room for you, hoping to flush you down the toilet.

It's been a fucking miracle for me.,"Was prescribed Omeprazole for a stomach condition. I took my first dose of it (20 mg) about an hour before my last dose of H before deciding to kick opiates for a while. Omeprazole's not a very interesting drug by itself, but in combination with *our favorites* such as Opiates & Benzos it has an effect of inhibiting the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, meaning drugs such as opiates & benzos stay in the blood stream longer (and possibly reach higher concentrations).

Here's what our good old friend Wikipedia says about it:

>Other examples of drugs dependent on CYP3A4 for their metabolism are escitalopram,[33] warfarin,[34] *oxycodone*, *tramadol*, and *oxymorphone*. The concentrations of these drugs may increase if they are used concomitantly with omeprazole.

I thought *nice score*! When I read that (the other common antacid used in this method is Cimetidine (an antacid and antihistamine on its own; and is often mentioned in opiate-potentiation guides).

So back to my withdrawal story. I had gone through a decent withdrawal about three or four weeks back. It **sucked**. However, I'm nearing the 72 hour mark now and I've only had one bout of diarrhea. The muscle aches aren't as intense, emotionally I'm a bit sensitive, but this is a walk in the park compared to last time.

Does anyone have any thoughts on if Omeprazole is what made this so easy? If so, it should be in every opiate addicts cabinet!",1524641854.0

I had been using heroin for almost 2 years. I made it to the bus stop, though I wasn't really sure where I was going. I knew that the next day I was going to get to the hospital to detox. At the bus stop it was getting dark and I was on the lookout for any users. I had about $50 or so on me from my boss that paid me under the table. 

On the corner there was a Happy's pizza. Across the street was a liquor store. I offered to buy a man a beer if he paid for them, as I was still underage. It was successful and we drank as we waited for the bus. There was trash around the bus stop. Everyone was hot and mad because the bus was late. I saw a lady approaching, asking people for money to get something to eat. When she got to me, she asked if I could help her get a couple dollars for some french fries or something. Looking around, I knew that she didn't want fries, and there wasn't really a place to get any. I asked her if she was looking for french fries or did she want something else? Immediately she switched up and with a smile on her face she knew exactly what I meant. 

We left the bus stop and she led me to a house where we could cop. Times like this made it hard to want to stop but I knew I had a problem. We waited for her dude to get home and went inside. I bought 40 worth of beautiful light tan powder dope. I bought some for the lady and she loaded her rig and was trying to shoot in her leg. Damn, I didn't want to be like that. I could still hit in my arm, though at times it wasn't easy. 

After staying there for a little while, I thanked them and went on my way. I was high and still had a little money in my pocket. It was hot and humid, the beginning of my third summer on heroin. I made it to another bus stop in front of a white building. There was a small wall of a flower bed to sit on. I grabbed my dope, rig, and water. I prepped a shot and it was hard to shoot in the dark. Mosquitoes kept landing on me, making it hard to focus. A man rode up to me at the bus stop, and I tried to hide what I was doing. Turns out he didn't really care, he was a fiend himself, named Terry. He helped with light and keeping the mosquitoes away until I could finally register and push. It felt good to have the amount of dope I had on me.

We started talking and he offered to pay for sex. I was already high with dope in my pocket, but I accepted. There was no place for us to do it, so we crossed the street to the neighborhood, and chose a spot in between two houses. It was dark enough, so the whoever was inside these brick homes probably would never know. We finished and i wondered when the bus would be on the way. Terry said I didn't have to worry about it, and that I could just stay at his place for the night. 

I hopped on the front of his bike and off we went to his house. We rode through the neighborhood under the streetlights. He taught me to lean with our turns. I was surprised that he could ride so well with my weight added. We arrived at his place, a corner house. He introduced me to his roommate and we went upstairs to his room. I prepped another shot before bed and lied down to sleep with the stranger I met an hour ago. He was nice to me.",1524620462.0

My side of the story.,"First, I want to start by saying that I have never consumed any type of drugs in my entire life. (dont worry, I did not come here to preach, much less I'm going to ask you to stop using, I respect you and your decisions) but wanted to tell you a bit about myself and how this subreddit change my perception of the world.

A few months ago, by mere chance I found this subrredit and felt incredibly curious. While browsing stories and memes I found myself laughing and crying from situations I couldnt relate and that I hardly understood which baffled me.

You have to know that I come from a country that has suffered unceasingly due to drug trafficking. I bet if I told you the name, you would immediately associate it with drug trafficking (No, it's not mexico lol.)

When I was little my father was a prominent farmer, and for many years he was approached by narco-terrorist groups that wanted to ""buy"" his land to plant poppy and coca. They also planned to set up labs to manufacture many types of drugs including heroin. 

My father that had some massive balls refused their offer. This was a very brave but not very smart move and resulted in multiple muerder attempts. Things finally got so bad that we were forced to move across the country and loose almost everything we had. 

Since that day I hated drugs with all my heart, but for some reason I blamed users more than I blamed narcos. In my mind, consumers were the reason why all of this was happening  to me and I blamed you for years. 

But against all odds, after reading some amazing stories and some very sad ones I felt the struggle and understood the many reasons that drive people to addiction and suddenly I could relate, and felt sympathy...

So even if this subrredit for you its just a safe space to share your experiences and laugh a little. For me its a very humane, tolerant and warm community full of amazing people just dealing with life the best they can. You showed me another perspective I've never considered before and helped me overcome my judgemental mindset.

Sometimes there is no wrong or right or better or worse or black and white. Finally we are all just people trying to find happiness in this shitty world.  

So from the bottom of my heart thank you. Be safe. ",1524580210.0

I sent my sub doctor a picture of my face and x-rays, and she said to take WHATEVER I needed to help with the pain, and if whatever the ER gave me wasn't strong enough she'd give me something else.

A lot of people give up after they’ve been parked on tramadol for months with no progress but luckily I don’t get prescribed tramadol because of side effects. So I was prescribed 30mg codeine pills. 2 pills 4 times a day. 

Today I called the doctor and said they weren’t working and he told me it is safe to double my dose. So I’m on 12 pills a day which will make my supply run out quicker (which was my intention. The supply only lasts me 2 days in reality) 

So I have 3-4 days left until I can go back but I was wondering if anyone thinks it’s a good idea to request the 60mg tablets after being told I can double the dose if the pain is still unbearable. 

The doctors I see have no suspicions of me yet and are very helpful in fact.

Tell me what to do!,"Soooooo...(settle in, kinda long) I helped out a friend that lost their job very unexpectedly and unfairly, having nothing whatsoever to do with their heroin habit. I know what happens when u lose a job as a junkie and no savings to cover ur daily habit, you go downhill fast and finding and keeping a new job is nearly fucking impossible. So I agreed to take care of them while they looked for a new job and started having money coming back in. They got a holiday job quickly and after that a permanent job immediately, both jobs well paying. Their current job pays $16- $17 an hour and is full-time. Their living expenses are minimal, no rent, no kids, no SO, but car needs a lot of upkeep. 
     Well, as I'm sure u have guessed, their bill has sky rocketed and they are less than diligent paying me back. I even charge them the lowest amount possible for the work they get. I should mention that on the scale of friends from 1 to 10, 10 being like damn near family, lifelong homie, help hide a body for each other friend, this person was about a 4-5 when I started helping them out. Not sure where they currently fall on the scale. We've stayed in constant communication, at one point I tallied up their bill, gave them another big discount and a reasonable payment deadline, they agreed to all of it but ultimately only repaid 70% of what they should have. Currently they owe a few thousand, we don't have a payment schedule in place, just a lot of talk about needing to get it taken care of, start lowering the bill and start lowering their usage level, lots of talk but no real action.
     Here's the problem, throughout this entire time they have kept up an active social life, no problem, I didn't expect or want them to become a hermit. However I recently got wind of an upcoming trip to a tropical location, a mutual friend informed me but they didn't know exactly when this trip was happening. So tonight, when I saw them for their daily dose, they gave me some story about a last minute, out of town trip for a family medical situation (non-emergency). They will be gone from tomorrow afternoon until Thursday, maybe Friday and could I give them in one chunk what they would normally get over all those days? Now I know they have told me stories and lies to justify why they haven't paid me more, problems with their paycheck, unexpected car issues etc...the normal junkie Bullshit but a straight up, only for fun, tropical vacation that they don't even tell me honestly about, really pissed me off. So now I gotta decide if this so-called family medical trip is for real or just another lie. Do I keep helping or leave them high and fucking dry? What would you guys do? I'm not hurting for money at the moment, but I don't like paying for other people's habits and I really fucking hate it when people think they are getting away with something when in fact I know what's up but choose not to confront them with it.

I just played one when I was a junkie.,"We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,

“Now baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I’m not actually a doctor.”

“Shut up!  It’s not funny!  Now hurry up!”

I pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.

“Now, we have to squeeze it.”  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn’t make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.

“Okay.  That should be good.”  We wrapped the wound in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.

The next night we went up to the strip club where she had worked a couple of years before. After 15 minutes of my waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So, we headed back to the town we met in.

I wasn’t afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about that town, it was that no one’s word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I’m not saying that they weren’t dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.

I've been on it now for the second time. I've been on it since January now and love the fact that I have a good job, can save money, can be trusted by my family more, and still be able to dabble with my blues once every month or two and get right back on track..

The only thing is that it has a huge impact on my lifting. When I was clean and not taking any subs, I weighed around 215, was decently big, and able to put up some weight (was repping 225 on bench pretty easily.) I now weigh around 195 and am noticeably smaller. I tried doing chest today and was struggling with 135 on the bar and could barely put up 155. I just got so disappointed and frustrated I gave up and left. 

Are there any tips any of you have for getting weight back up? I know my appetite has a huge impact on this as I have to force myself to eat sometimes because I'm never hungry. I could eat only a decent sized lunch and be all set with food for the entire day. 

Also do subs have anything to do with testosterone levels? ",1524536517.0

Been on the rocks lately and wondering should I explode.,Ok everyone. Me and my boyfriend where like best friends back in 2013. We started shooting up and thing turned into a bromance and than dating. I would suck his dick at night but he wanted to keep it in the down low but things where becoming transparent. Well I talked to one of my old trap buddy not to long ago and he brought up the time we all where sitting in a car. And one of my other friends named Sam texted my Kevin (boyfriend) said hey come pick me up and smoke a blunt and like me also suck that dick. Got into a big fight with sam and we all got over it. But I would get mad at Kevin for hanging out with him alone. Now Sam had all the plugs to the dope and the excuse was always like I was getting dope. Than my birthday rolled again last week and I basically broke up with Kevin. Long stupid story. I talked to my old trap buddy about it and he said he was always sneaky. I asked him what he meant by all of this. He said a couple of years ago when I was away at rehab. My buddy was at a friends house and Kevin texted his friend and said he wanted to give him head and also sent a dick pic. But my friend said it seemed like it was meant for someone else. Now I’ve always had a feeling that Kevin was cheating on me a couple of times but I couldn’t prove it. Now I’m trying to get in contact with this Zack kid and figure it out. This will be some dead to right type evidence. Hopefully he remember this shit. But what should I do. Kevin will eventuallycome back to me and should I bring it up?

Do I just hold it for like half an hour and then take the patch off so that the rest wouldn't be released? I'm a bit confused.

I have used opiates before, but nothing major. Just codeine, tramadol, kratom. Is there a safe way to use these patches at all, or should I forget about it altogether? 

Edit: I read up on these patches and concluded that it is a super idiotic idea. I won't do them.

My stepdad has some back problems but they're definitely nowhere near as bad that he would be taking this shit. I'm puzzled to be honest.

My question is how do you deal our obligations? Like prayer x times a day (I know the answer to that, probably the same as mind, you'd like to do it more, but you just don't for x reason), Friday prayer, and Ramadan (as it's approaching).


On methadone it was simple, get to the clinic at 4 AM, wait an hour till 5 when they opened, dose within 4 minutes to avoid doing after Fajr.  And I only smoked bud at night.

I plan to not use at all that month, as I'm planning another break (I tend to use for 2 months, break for 2, repeat), but I'm curious how a stronger user would cope all day? 

So, I'm curious, are you like me, who will absolutly not step foot inside a Masjid if I'm high? I've gone to jummah sick as a dog, and then copped. I just feel it horribly disrespectful to do so high, but that's just my opinion.

IMO religion is a relationship between you and God, so there are no right or wrong answers, I'm just curious what bros/sis take on this, since I can't ask anyone at the masjid....


""Salam Imam! Is it permissible to shoot heroin before Jummah? or is it haram?!""

Each with a different ‘dream’. I was dreaming, but I was awake, but I wasn’t.. then I’d snap out of it, drift off again, and have a different dream. Throughout this, my entire body is so warm. Emotionally, I feel fantastic. Worry free. Just.. perfectly content. (Is this actually what’s referred to as nodding?)

Overall, 10/10 experience. Would take this over meth any day of the week. 

Part of me wants to flush the rest.. because I already know if I keep going I’ll end up hooked. 

Side question: how does H, specifically #4, compare to oxycodone?

So all I’ve been able to find lately is shitty ass scramble. This shit burns the hell out of my nose and barely gets me high.

Yesterday I met up with a dealer that I got from waiting in a parking lot for another dealer... lol.

He’s been selling me ‘uncut’ rocks. Obviously they’re cut to some extent, but he just doesn’t cut it himself again into shitty ass scramble with tons of Benadryl or whatever it is.

So he made me come all the way through yesterday and wait a while only to admit he doesn’t have any on him. 

Started to sketch me out when him and his friend (I barely know either) jumped into my whip and told me to drive to get it.

When we got down the street, he asked to use my phone and called like 3 of his hookups.

Finally a dude answered and was surprisingly right down the street. He pulled up in literally 5 seconds.

I could tell immediately when I looked at this dude that he was older and has been in the game for a while. I knew that this is who all the small-time dealers were copping from before they cut their shit.

I was overcharged baaaad. Sold me 4 points for like 75 bucks :/
The shit was greeeeat though.

Buuuut today I realized the number was left in my phone. And another post gave me courage to just call him and say I got from him yesterday.  I didn’t want him to tell my other guy that I was being sketchy.

But it was a success... and of course he’ll sell that same great shit for a much cheaper price.

Finally got a good hookup close by :’)

So funny how this happened... met him through having met four other dealers randomly while waiting in parking lots / calling numbers left in my phone.

Cheers guys! This stuff is nice, light tan rocks for $15 a point. Usually prices here are like $10 a tenth instead but this stuff is waaaaay better and I don’t mind paying it.

Super stoked (•‿•)

Called the number one of my dealers left in my phone. Now I have a hookup to the good dope before it’s cut again!",1524495992.0

I've browsed through the sub quite a bit looking for answers, and gotten quite a bit of information, but I'd love to get an up to date response a little more tailored to my situation if at all possible.

So here's what's going on - 
Ive been informed by my work that I've got a mouth swab that has to be taken. I could have taken it last Friday, but they gave me the option of that or sometime this coming week, so naturally I chose the latter. Now, I smoke pot daily, and sniff h daily. About .2-.4 per day. Stopping smoking weed for a week won't be a problem, but that's not the one I'm worried about. 

My question to all of you is: 
How can I pass this test while being uncomfortable for the shortest possible time frame? If I need to take Kratom or Lope or some other withdrawal lessening substance, I'm more than open to suggestions. Wasn't able to acquire any subs. I have on hand Gabapentin and trazadone as well, don't think those will show up on the test.

 I have to swab my my mouth and then leave the swab in for five minutes. The swab will then be sent to a lab. So basically, I want tips regarding all stages and aspects of this. 

Tldr: swab test this week. When should I take it, what should I abstain from and for how long, and how can I suffer as little as possible from withdrawals while still passing.

A few months ago I splurged $25 and bought a gram of an opioid known as methoxyacetylfentanyl, or MAF. This drug produces a deliciously warm five hour buzz. It's also exceptionally potent - just one tenth of a milligram is equivalent to a few bags of street heroin, and there are one thousand milligrams in one gram.  

For the mathematically impaired among us, that's ten thousand strong doses, enough to get a solid nod every evening for a decade.  

So naturally, I used all ten thousand doses within three months and then went into a horrific withdrawal.  

Or did I? Well, I did go into a horrific withdrawal, but what about the MAF being gone? Oh, I definitely poured the last of the crystal residue from the baggie and made quick work of it, that's unquestionable. But there must have been a hundred invisible doses stuck to the sides of the baggie and I can't recall any bag-scraping for the life of me. Try as I might, I cannot dredge up the memory of doing anything with that 'empty' bag. Surely I didn't throw it away?  

It's almost midnight at the moment so I can hardly tear up my room trying to find this baggie, but tomorrow morning I'm going to flip everything upside down and get to the bottom of this mystery.

One of the topics that stand out to me surrounds how, as laws are tightened, legislation written into law, the chronic pain patient, the very person these drugs are aimed at helping are increasingly being denied their medication. Either that, or made to jump through countless hoops in order to secure the medication they are rightly entitled to.

I can only read articles and watch documentaries. I have no first or second hand knowledge on this topic. Could I ask my fellow Redditor‘s across the pond; is this actually a big problem in the US?

My first post over in this sub. As the title says, my BF of 2 months told me last week that he's been moderately addicted to oxycodone for the past 8 months following a very harrowing near-death experience that almost cost him his life and he was prescribed them for pain management.

He's been buying them off the street. This in itself terrifies me. 

We had a few troubles in our relationship and when I called him out about it, he got really reactive and we didn't speak for 2 weeks. He confessed his addiction to me on this past Thursday, and I was floored. Like, floored. I had no idea. I've never been involved with someone who was addicted to anything other than booze or pot (not sheltered, just careful) and looking back, I realized that it explained a lot of his behaviours.  He has told me that he hasn't used since the day we broke up, because he was ashamed of the way he'd been acting and how much he hurt me.

My question to you is this: What are some of the typical ""signs"" of oxy use that I should be on the lookout for in case he slips or was just plain lying to me? Everything I've read online was very generalized, i.e. ""mood swings"". This is a strange situation for me since he has been high every time I've seen him. I don't know what his ""normal"" self is like without the oxy.

I did read a bit about the aftermath of getting off it, and yeah, those symptoms sound a lot like what he was going through when I saw him on Saturday.  He was wrecked but looked better than I've seen him. He was in good spirits, if a bit distracted. His belly wasn't happy with him and he was sick a few times. He hasn't been sleeping well and would alternate between being very hot to shivering, covered in goosebumps. He didn't have any flu or anything; I am sure it was his body freaking the fuck out from not having his fix.

Any advice or help you could give would mean a lot to me. I just want to help him get better, and it says a lot to me that I was the catalyst for his change. He's not doing it FOR me; he's doing it BECAUSE of me.",1524480475.0

I was invited by some old classmates to barbecue at their place last weekend. I was surprised and decided to go since it was a welcome distraction from just studying for my finals and shooting, without much social interaction.





When we all sat together the conversation turned to the recent death of that DJ guy, aviici. So they started joking about how heroin was healthier than alcohol and that he might be alive if he had opted for heroin instead of alcohol. Not factually wrong, but I bet you know those jokes along the lines of 'haha, it's funny to say heroin because it's so absurd to shoot heroin'. They went on for while like 'oh, yeah, you could shoot some heroin, it's not that bad, lololol'. I felt super uncomfortable and when I left I couldn't really pinpoint why I felt *so* uncomfortable. Tbh I got a little paranoid and thought they were laughing at me tho they don't even know I use. They know I used to have a drug problem when I was younger bc I came straight from an inpatient treatment when I was added to the class. 



Being brutally honest, my thought process was even weirder. I had a best girlfriend in that class who had the bad habit of sleeping with/going after guys I was involved with. Because she was comfy around them after I introduced them (her reasoning lol). After she spread her legs for my just-ex and lying to me about it, things went really sour and I plunged into the worst depression of my adult life. They still are together, I think. Also some other stuff happened that made shit worse for me. I may or may not have threatened to maybe overdose because she had been a bad fwiend. Yes, super cringe. And I thought, maybe she told them I was using dope and they invited me to verify that. How fucking stupid can I be? Why does my brain work like that? 




So instead of figuring out these insecurities by myself and questioning my sick social paranoia, I texted one of the guys I used to be close friends with in school and *asked why I was invited*. I cringe so hard just saying this. Like, what if he asked why I would even say that? Should I say that I couldn't imagine anyone inviting me and spending time with me voluntarily without an ulterior motive? That I think it intuitively more likely that people hate me and want to ridicule me? Argh! What did I even expect when I wrote this? I don't know, I can't stop thinking about it. And I wish I could say something to take away the weirdness of the question. But there really isn't anything that would make me look any less weird and stupid. (If you have an idea though, I'd be eternally grateful.) 




Do you know that social paranoia? Always thinking 'THEY KNOW!' and in turn acting super irrationally? And even without thinking they know I'm a user - social interaction gets always super weird for me. 





Just kill me please. I don't know man, every time I try to rebuild my social life I get so freaking paranoid and fuck shit up because I feel so uncomfortable being me that I can't imagine anyone liking to be around me.





If I didn't have some dope atm to keep me calm I know would fuck up my exams too. So, praise Junkie Jesus my mom lend me some money to balance my credit card. Praise the Lord for poppies, because without, if not I, the cringe would fucking kill me. 


Hope the fam is safe and well.




TLDR: I asked someone why they did invite me because I'm an absolute socially handicapped idiot. And thanks for heroins, because if not for heroins the cringe at myself would kill me. ",1524468022.0

Multiple people (even including doctors) have said ""you don't need naloxone...if you did they wouldn't even put it in your medication in the first place.""  Even after explaining naloxone does NOTHING orally/bucally their mentality is that I have all the naloxone I need in pill form and if that's not enough then I shouldn't be on Suboxone in the first place.  I even have the mindset that both people and doctors are absolute and utter f*cking morons when it comes to helping to save a life just because they are completely in the dark or have no care when it comes to people in my predicament.  My primary doctor will not write the prescription, my emergency dept. won't, and the only way to obtain naloxone is by walking into a pharmacy and slapping down $170 for a SINGLE DOSE KIT.  Why should we have to pay that much for one dosage when a single vial and sterile needle costs 1/20th of that?

I've searched for over a month trying to get my hands on one or two naloxone vials as I already have my sharps (I also am on test for medicinal purposes and never inject a single milligram more than I'm allowed - nor do I have the desire).  I've went to the county clinic trying to obtain a single prescription and they refuse to budge on the grounds that ""there are people that need naloxone much worse than you do"" solely because I'm already in recovery and I'm the only person that matters because I've been able to get this far in life in spite of my addictions.  I already know with a prescription, my health insurance, and/or GoodRx I can purchase two 2mg vials for less than $20 out the door and if it means saving mine or someone else's life then I gladly pay it - getting my hands on the vials/amps are a different story however.

Are there resources available that would perhaps allow someone with a preexisting addiction receive a prescription for naloxone, even if every pharmacy in our area will sell naloxone OTC for $170 for a single dose?  I've called my town hall, been to city meetings, and done everything I know how to do and haven't been able to find someone that would be able to help and I can't jeopardize my own integrity just to ""cop some naloxone.""  If there are some ideas others have used before to get a prescription for it, consider me all ears because I've experienced first (and second) hand what this antidote can do for people about to overdose.  You'd think being in the heartland of opiate addiction a plea for help would be heard with open ears but there aren't many people advocating for myself or the others in my area so I feel like it has to start somewhere.  Any ideas, tips, or recommendations would be highly welcome.  Thank you very much.",1524462416.0

Bupe, Subutex, Methadone, etc. I'm going to the intake appointment and I'm going to tell them my history and current use.

I've talked to a few people and they told me to confide in the docs and counselors to find the best treatment  I don't want Methadone, so I'm gong to shoot for a Sub taper. However, I've NEVER been to a maintenance or treatment clinic, so I'm going to go over any options with the doc.

I can't fucking keep taking so much Hydro. The APAP is toxic as shit and I don't know anyone that has a better alternative. So, I'm going to a clinic to a doc that can help before I completely fuck my liver. I can deal with being a junkie per se, but I'm worried about my health. Specifically my liver. I have a good job and I'm able to function at it 100% and I'm able to pay all of my bills.

So, while I still have my life on track, I'm seeking help. I'm still staying in this community on this sub, but I'll be on a healthier alternative that doesn't have 3-4g of APAP included.

Sublingual ROA is by far my preference. I'm torn between sublingual and buccal. I humbly consider myself a pro as far as the technique but I'm never above advice.  I recently started heating the patch under a lighter just before administering under the tongue. DO NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE AN INSANE TOLERANCE!! I got to the point of 100mcg patches not satisfying my thirst. This technique will knock your socks off, trust me. The first time I did it I thought I was toast. I want to hear you guys' personal techniques and tips, maybe I can pick up on something.

If you do decide, which I DO NOT CONDONE, be very cognizant of the following:

Pull up the hard plastic film (touch the sticky side as little as possible) and grab it on the very tip of one of the corners with a pair of tweezers. Remove it completely from the plastic, turn the patch horizontally with the sticky side up (facing the ceiling) and start about a foot over the flame. Once you notice the heat causing the patch to rise and flutter hold it still. The sticky side will start to glaze over and seem wet. Be super careful! Angle your eye to where you can see the flame through the patch so you can monitor the texture. If you notice the patch start to go transparent from the outer edge inward STOP. This is a no-no, you're too close to the flame and burning up the medication rendering the patch useless. The sweet spot is when you see it super glossy and glazed over all-the-while maintaining the blurry transparency the patch originally had. Once you get it right pop it under the tongue or in between  the gum and cheek. It takes alot of practice and finesse but when you get it right...GOT-DAMN! Be somewhere comfy because you're going down for the count on Unicorn Island son!

Use your head. Know your limits and be damn sure you have a friend around in case it's too potent. That's not going to happen though because you're smart enough to know not to try this! ;P

Oh and I do this with cut up pieces of the patch. Not the entire patch. Use your head.",1524431754.0

I’m not trying to get high as a kite but lately I don’t even really feel “good” when taking the meds... are they canceling each other out? Or is my brain just fried and doesn’t respond to them anymore? For the purpose of blocking opiates the subs def work as I’ve relapsed and not gotten high at all.. but as for the adderal it’s so crazy like I literally can’t even tell that I take it!

This could go in two other subs as well but I love you guys the most and I know many of you have been where I am so here goes...,"First of all I’m 20 months free from heroin. And I’m pretty fucking proud of that. However during those 20 months I was drinking and doing the occasional sub and a line of blow here and there. I told myself no big deal bc the real monster is the opiates. And then while I was stealing some of my mothers pain pills I justified it that heroin is my real problem. 

I’ve had a lot of problems due to my use. I’ve been to 8 treatment facilities and incarcerated 8 or so times (I don’t think I was coherent a few of them so it may be more). Anyways, I just faced some pretty serious legal consequences and managed to avoid prison and instead completed a one year intensive outpatient program (and by intensive I mean 5 days a week 8 hrs a day - 45 min to an hr drive from my house). It was exhausting but I felt great that I did it. This time though I didn’t go to meetings. I didn’t get a sponsor. (And I won’t in the future so please no AA/NA is the only way types bc that not true.) I basically just showed up to group bc I was legally required to. But hey I finished it. Never completed a program in my life. So... go me. To that rehabs credit though they focused on my mental health disorder PTSD and that was amazing help. 

Fast forward a bit I ended up suffering a miscarriage a few months ago. I didn’t even think I could have kids so I was so excited just to be devastated w the loss. But I got through it -clean. 

Something just clicked in me and I don’t feel the need to always non stop think about getting high. I missed so much good stuff in my life doing that. I just feel like I’m over it. I’m too tired to go running around like that again. Staying high everyday is tough work (and people call junkies lazy- bitch please I worked my ass off every day to feed my habit. Granted it wasn’t ethical work or contributing to society but it was work and it sucked and I’m grateful I made it through that.) I’m too old and tired to go through all this again. 

I just got back from an extended visit w my significant other. He lives in another state and has a great job and is moving to my state just to be w me. I am so blessed. He is so sweet to me. Like one of those guys that I’m positive will love me for me forever. My penguin. However,  the visit was great and all but he’s a medical professional (DO) and he doesn’t drink. Doesn’t party. Goes to bed at 9pm wakes up at 4am. He’s an amazing human being and I don’t understand why he lives me like he does. 

Anyways on my trip I was alone in his house all day long. Bored af. It was cold af so there was no going for walks. He has one car and it’s a stick which I can’t drive so I was stuck in the house all day long. Bored af. So. Of course I peruse Reddit for hours on end. Specifically the heroin opiates and cocaine subs. I used to do this just to try and offer support to people like “hey I’m a complete fuck up and I did it you can too”  “Did it” to me means no heroin no shiesty behavior and basically I’m alive not a zombie and around my family and friends now. 

Okay here’s the problem. I started talking to a friend kind of romanticizing how great and eight ball of crack and 30 Oxus would be. Then I was looking at those drug subs all day. Triggered af but stubborn and tough so no big deal I tell myself. Then I get a msg from an old dealer that he’d just like to “see” me. Mmmhmm. I was about to entertain the idea when I decided if I’m gonna do it I’m not getting involved w a dealer. I’ll call a friend and just go party one night and that’s it leave. Well this particular friend and I used to smoke a ton of crack together. I thought I would go over there, we’d do a few hits, go to dinner, then blamo I’m outta there. 

Guys I get to my friends house and he looks like a shell of his former self. Gaunt, can’t remember things for a conversation, tells me the military just deemed him 100% disabled. He’s a combat vet. (W an arsenal of guns in his room. And I mean arsenal. I’m all for gun rights but I think we need to look into the people w serious mental health disturbances but I’m on a tangent)

Moving on. This dude in the almost two years since I’ve seen him has become a crack smoking aficionado. Has a box of special order pipes to his specs. 1000 per box. 3 types of chore boy. Stem holders that double as coolers. 100 bic lighters. Scale that measures to the  .0001. Huge glass jar filled of hard. 7gs to be exact. I almost couldn’t speak it was like heaven and hell at the same time. We ended up smoking it all. I was shaky and felt weird bc I’ve never smoked without heroin to level me out. He gave me some kpins. Thank God. 

He goes to bed. I try to sleep. Made it an hour. Came back upstairs and pushed the fuck out of every pipe we used. My fingers were black from that oily chore. Gross. I don’t want to live like this I just keep going through the motions though. 

He won’t wake up and it was like 11am. Time to get up bud I’ve been up all night. I tell him we need to go get more before I have to go home tonight bc I have regular life Monday that I’m certainly not fucking up. He won’t get up. I get pissed (why? I dunno bc once a junky always a junky and I wanted more) So my genius idea is to go cop myself from the guy that sent me that msg. I kept him in my Facebook “just in case.” (Please no levtures about all we have to change is everything bc as I stated above I’ve been to rehab A LOT.) So I go meet Justin Case and get more hard and he throws me a “tester” of boy.  When I got back I weighed it and it was a fucking half g. For free. Trying to pull me back in. 

I did a line. Bc I’m weak. It was amazing. I’m all warm and fuzzy but I know that’s just heroin  lying. That’s how it gets you hooked into slavery.  Point of my story. I do not want this to be the day I throw everything away (just the heroin in my pocket) I’m not going down that road ever again. I got a preview- it still sucks- I’m still out. 

I can’t believe I did this. But at the same time I’m not gonna wallow around about losing my clean time. When people make mistakes they acknowledge them and move on. Too many times I’ve relapsed and went on a two year bender bc I was so ashamed. So what. I fucked up. I’m handling it. I’m still me and I’m still awesome. I’m still claiming my date bc that’s the day I really began to fight and took my life back. I give zero fucks if anyone disagrees w that. It’s not like I’m gonna stand up at a meeting and say “Hi my name is so and so and I’ve been clean 20 months.” I don’t go to meetings and I’ll live my life how I want. 

I had an abusive controlling ex who died of an overdose and now I currently reside w my abusive mother and I’m tired of being put down. I’ve done it to myself. Others do it. I’m tired of it. Yeah I shouldn’t have done that. But when people make mistakes they shrug em off n keep going. 

❤️

TLDR ended up getting a free half g from a dboy, threw it away (did a line), still consider myself awesome bc I’m not jumping into that nightmare again. 

Also if your sober and have idle hands, stay outta the drug subs kids. If you must go go for support or help and don’t spend hours salivating over drug porn. Learn from me. Ms. FuckUpUSA. And you know what- I’m damn proud of it. 

This could have been way worse. ",1524427639.0

I smoked some that day, but had 200mg left. Yesterday I met a girl who's my ""net-friend"". 

She wanted to buy drugs, and failed at doing so in the city centre. I said I could probably sell her something, and at first I had speed in mind as she already uses it.

She figured out that I had some heroin too, and she really wanted to buy it. At first I was hesitating, not wanting her to start doing it. She told me she was going to share half of it with a friend, and take small amounts/be careful.

I set the price at double the amount I paid. She then nearly doubled the amount I asked for, but I was still hesitating. Then she offered me 5x the price I paid, which I thought would get me a bit money for drugs.

I couldn't resist the offer, though I was also pretty high when I sold her. I'm not a dealer or anything, this was just a one time thing. She said she'd be careful, and remember that this was her first time.

Today she sent me a snap. She took all of it at once by injection. I thought ""Fuck! Fuck! FUCK!!"" because I was afraid she was going to OD. 

Luckily nothing bad really happened, thiugh her body started to shake and she threw up when the comedown hit her. I'm relieved as fuck. But to be honest it really irritates me that she promised to be careful, then she ends up injecting the entire thing when it's her first time!

Meme-poster, shadow commenter and long-time lurker of this sub. Kind of just venting because I feel conflicted.

I moved off of one coast to the other coast (USA) and quit using opiates about seven months ago. I was in a really bad spot after relapsing (I had thrown away three years of sobriety at that point) and I needed to escape. I have a good job at a non-profit and I'm more than likely going to receive a promotion next week- I fell into the normie culture that is your late 20's/early 30's. 

Anyway, when I moved, I totally abstained from opiates here. They're not easy to find where I am and to be honest, at this point I'm too fucking lazy to put in the work to try and find them. BUT- in June, I'm going back to my hometown for five days to visit and I've already been texting with my old dealer (we were... well, kind of friends. Poor Ry-tard- bless his soul) and setting up for him to hook me up with a whole script of percs.

Every logical fiber of my being is telling me- ""NO- don't do this- you know how awful you're going to feel afterward."" but every other passionate part of my brain is like: ""You've been sober for almost a year now- you've earned it- let yourself have fun. Just live in the moment.""

I'm writing this as if I'm going to even consider making a different decision when I know damn well I'm going to cop the first day I'm back home.

There is almost no information on this compound. I have searched through scholar and research databases with no success, and the only information I found about this compound after searching for information for 2+ hours online is:

1. It is 100+ times stronger than morphine
2. It is a codeinone derivative, which is essential for the creation of hydrocodone primarily and, to a lesser extent, oxycodone, as a substitute for thebaine.
Edit: Forgot to add it's LD50:
3. It has an IV LD50 of 31mg/kg in mice. This is much more higher than similar strength compounds like fentanyl. 

From what I know about chemistry and looking at the chem spiders:
*Codeinone is 1/3rd the potency of codeine. Codeinone is a ketone of codeine, which can be achieved by removing two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.
*The addition of a 14-cinnamoyl chain to hydroxycodeinone(which is another name for oxycodone) results in a minimum of 66-fold increase in potency.

This is speculation, but I think this semi-synthetic opioid could change the pressed pills game entirely. Having something that is so powerful in small quantities that is comparable in effects to oxycodone, it seems that it could make pressed roxis become almost identical in effect and feel to the real ones, and cost far less than a dollar per mg. on the street.

Does anyone have knowledge about this substance? It seems completely under the radar of not just research, but RC users and distributors as well.",1524345687.0

Shortly after, a couple of kind do gooders reached out to me and implored me to get a script. One said ""when you have a script, you know you can just go to a real pharmacy and pick it up. No more getting stressed out when someone doesn't answer the phone or doesn't show up on time. Also makes it easier to make travel plans."" Then they ended with ""P.S.- You won't have to deal with that bum Cliff anymore.""

&nbsp;

So I speak to the sub connect and they pushing to see me early at 11am so I say, I gotta sleep off a mean cold but I should be around. They then show up in my 'hood around 11am even though I never responded to their text before they departed.

&nbsp;

Hours later I make new arrangements to meet them half way, near my job. So they take some odd ball bus that doesn't let off near my job. They then text me while on the bus but they don't tell me where they'll be exactly. Then they call.. the call drops. I try to call back no luck.

I get one more text.

""My phone is dying...""

&nbsp;

After I finished my paperwork at work, I head toward home. On my way back home I get a call and the person is like ""no, please meet me on the other-other side of town. You know what, the cross street they proposed was near my planned final destination so I say fuck it I'll do it.

On the way there they go ""I can get a rid to that cross street, there's a mcdonalds I'll go to."" Then they say text when you're 10 minutes away. So I do. Before the 10 minutes the connect texts ""we're here"" and keeps texting ""how many minutes? how far?"" and ""please hurry"". Like dude, I told you exactly how long I would be when I left. There is nothing that changes that on a bike on hilly terrain.

&nbsp;

I get to the cross street. I see no McDonalds. They go ""meet me at McDonalds"" but that's 14 minutes away. So I decide, just meet me at my destination. No, they say we can drive to you mad quick. Well, turns out they could.

&nbsp;

Car pulls up to the curb, she loudly gets out of the car but kindly gives me my product in exchange for cash and it's the mint flavored zubsolvs. The Yemeni deli owners across the street are looking at me like ""that car stopped next to a cyclist, they talked briefly, the car left and the bicyclist went his separate way.""

OBV looking shady as fuck.

Before last November, I was taking 10\-20 mgs \(just 1 or 2 pills\) of hydrocodone daily.  Had back surgery in November that went well.  Immediately following surgery for about 2 months I was taling between 6 and 10 Oxycodone a day.  By the end of January, 2018 i had slowed that pace to 1\-2 10mg pills a day.  Since  mid\-March I've been more or less maintaining on just 1 10mg oxy / day.  

By 2 pm every day I feel the screaches.  The reminders that I need the meds.  I've gone for single days a couple of times, but never more than 48 hours before I cave in and relieve the nastiness with a pill.  I'm nearing the end of my prescription, and know I wont have more without making up some kind of story, because my back surgery really was a success.  I want to get off the meds completely, but the question is, how long will I have the immense need to stop the screaches...that piercing ear ringing, the nasty fuzzy head/body need for the dose? 

It's been a very long time since I havent had the meds in the body.  Is there something that will help me get through completely weening the craving?  I've got about 3 weeks worth of oxy left in the bottle at this rate.  I dont want to find the bottom of the jar, without first stopping.

They help keep users from contracting HIV and Hepatitis C from dirty needles, give them information on local clinics that treat addiction, and if they can afford it, distribute Narcan that is the #1 way to reverse overdose and save the users' life.

As far as personally, support your friend. There's not a whole lot you can do for an addict other than urge them to stop using (without being crazy about it), and keeping Narcan on hand, in case they overdose in your presence. Learn how to use the Narcan effectively as well.

We used some more last night, and this morning we both woke up feeling pretty shitty. He had to throw up a few times and I nearly had to while feeling cold. We both have recurring headaches.

This led me to wonder, how quickly can one get withdrawal symptoms from this stuff? And what can one do to ease symptoms such as these? Also, any respectful information on how quickly one can get addicted is appreciated, since we both lost (and gained) some of the typical opiate fears around (ab)use and chipping.

We didn't like it very much at first, yet we both felt the need to use the next day, even though our rational minds told us it wasn't even that fun. I honestly prefer ketamine and benzos to this vague, even slightly nauseating feeling. 

Heroin isn't sold much around here, and we've both used an absolute shit ton of drugs in our lives, 30+ and 60+ respectively, but have never used anything to fill a void. Our lives are fulfilling and we're likely just going to slowly use it up over the next year or so and never seek it out again.

I moved out west around 8 months ago from across the country out east. Shortly after being here I gave in to the temptations and start using black tar. I prefer to use IV and this tar has completely trashed all my veins I can barely find one to hit when I really need too. In my 6 years of using (China white) back out east, I was able to use the same vein a thousand times, only needing to switch it up periodically.

Because of this, and how much money I’m fucking spending, I wanna take at least a long break for now. Get back into healthier habits. The only problem is I’m having an insanely hard time finding suboxone out here.

My good friend from back home said he would happily send me out a couple of strips (4) and a few baggies (to enjoy before the subs). What would you say the best way to do this is? FedEx it all over, just send it in a regular envelope through USPS, etc. Curios to know if anyone on this sub has done this before, has an tips, or better solutions to this problem.

i tried one tonight it worked well

i might even use them to quit subs altogether. 

hopefully i dont get addicted t tram . the jitteryish high at even lowish doseages is kinda weird, but 50mg before taking my subs was fucking awesome and i was pain free for a few hours and i thank that nurse for that one pill that she didnt have to give me due to our fucked up laws. 


and i thank her twice if she actually got me a script (supposedly the papers, and nurse said i did)



i realize to you guys tramadol isnt a big deal but i have seen so many doctors and i even saw a neurologist recently whom i was referred to by my insurance. we called ahead of time and made sure they treated tmj. when i got there , he didnt give me any meds, and told me he does not work with the jaw. he ordered me MRIs of my head, which ive already had done.


I asked him 6 times to order a MRI for my jaw


I was referred to pain management and a chiropractor i cant pay for . even though he said to me ""why go to a chiropractor if you know it doesnt help you""





Atleast this nurses/doctors (she seemed likea new doctor) stayed within her bounds and respected me to the upmost {without getting fired i guess} . The other ERs ive been to have not been kind at all! These guys atleast presented a few options . and atleast gave me a tramadol when i asked . 



i heard her speaking with the nurses about how to override the narcotic thing on the prescription monitoring thing lol. was presented with one tablet to go home . so yea. atleast some respect was given. atleast some relief was achieved. 



do you guys think i would have any luck if i went to a ketamine clinic there are 3 near me

A couple minutes later, 2 more dudes storm in and say that J is a cop and he needs to empty his pockets. They said I'm cool because they've seen me before somewhere. He complies, and they throw everything on the floor, including the money we spent hours trying to get. Another guy runs in and grabs the money.  I say to J why are you letting them do that? He didn't know what to do. 

We walked out and the dudes had ""no idea"" where the other guy went. So now we're back in the car, dopesick with no money or dope. We light a cigarette and one of the guys asks for one and snatches the whole pack and walks away. I was so mad at J. He wouldn't stand up for himself and now we had nothing. ",1524273578.0

While I am taking it for pain due to Crohn's I really want to try and live my life without being beholden to medicine. Especially medicine that messes with my mood. 

I have been tapering for the past 6 months. I started at 16mg a day (2x8mg for pain), and was able to go all the way down to 0.5mg a day. But I was miserable. Every day I would go into withdrawals within 6 hours of my last dose. Making the conscious decision to no longer be miserable I started taking 2-4 mg a day. I'm rationalizing it as being needed in order to pass a job interview. 

Long story short, I tried extremely hard to go from 0.5 mg to 0.25 mg so I could jump. Instead of doing this I am wondering if anyone has gone through Rapid Detox while on Buprenorphine? Because of it's long half life I'm wondering if being under while the naloxone works is going to be enough to make it through the worst of the withdrawals. I've never had an issue with wanting to take pain meds again after detoxing, manually. I always start back up from a Crohn's flair. So I figure, I get this job, save up the money for rapid detox in a couple of months and just go get it done and deal with the long term post opiate effects. I'd have to deal with them anyways, I just want to be done with this stuff.

Anyone have experience with these rapid detox places?",1524273687.0

We dropped off the hustler girl that didn't do drugs, and made our way to the spot. ""Joe"" let's us in. We need 5 girls and 5 boys. We spend $100, made by committing various crimes. I didn't participate in much, but I still got a small share. I never liked the way everything was split up. At least I would still get some. 

Ol girl and her friend are prepping up their shots and talking about having hep c. In this abandoned house, we sat in the old dining room I would assume. Dirty yellow walls and brown flooring. A ripped blanket covers the door entry to the next room. Empty baggies and used needles piled up in the corner. A rectangle coffee table sits in front of the ripped up loveseat. My girl didn't have a working rig and didn't want to share immediately after them. They said there might be an extra one in the truck. How stupid. Asking for it. 

As she came back inside, I saw her holding it. The numbers were faded, and there was still dried blood inside and out. In this moment I was consumed by anger and fear. Begging her to not do this. It didn't matter. She needed her dope and there was nothing anybody could do about it. 

I couldn't take it anymore, so I walked outside to the back of the house and sat on what was left of the back porch. No idea what time it was, and I felt like I was alone forever.  Nobody came out to find me like deep inside I wish she would. I knew the reason I was so mad was because we both shared rigs. 

Eventually, I hopped down to the driveway and came back in the house. She was sitting on ol girl's lap. They laughed when they saw the look on my face. How did I get to this point in my life? It wasn't over anytime soon.

She left and we planned to meet up afterwards. When I was leaving she happened to be in the front lobby because she had left some items on the rehab wing. I left two days earlier so she wasn't expecting me to be out yet.

She ended up driving me home and we fucked for hours and quite literally professed our love for each other. We both had multiple Os. I spent the last twenty four hours with her... she just left.

No the sketch part is that she is a stripper, has had two kids, she is 32 and I am 28, and she has an abusive husband who gave her a black eye and put five cig burns on her face and arms the day she got out. 

She's has crazy daddy issues, self worth issues, every one she deals with is still using. She has PTSD and other diagnosis. 

She is absolutely gorgeous, very funny and dorky. She is a kind of punk rock chick/Tom boy. She is so sweet to me. She also has lots of money and wants to be my sugar mama. She is going to pick me up on sunday and get us a room. I have only had sex this good with one other person.

I am also on a high dose of gabapentin. Long story short, my wife cut me off everything two days ago. I thought maybe if I go get a dose of methadone it will help my back pain at least for a little while. I spent 3 1/2 hours in that clinic this morning talking to a counselor, and doctor, filling out paperwork, getting drug tested, etc. This is a long term program and is every involved. I finally took my 30mg dose this morning which tasted like watered down cough syrup and guess what? My back still hurts and I feel exactly the same. I wasted all morning for this. I guess it's back to square one now. Like I said, probably great for the serious addict, but for someone like me it was a waste of time.

I'm feeling tons of anxiety. Out of breath. It's fucking miserable just to walk. I just downed I think 14 of lope and I'm going to drag myself out in a few hours to find some kratom to make it through the weekend.

My body is screaming that I need more drugs--and I definitely did the junkie search to make sure there wasn't anything I had missed (there totally wasn't). It's 2 long weeks until my refill and I've got no plugs and no hope for one. 

I'm trying to remind myself that I wasn't any better on the oxy. I was dosing every 2-3 hours and was completely fucking useless. I slept every weekday for 2 weeks straight. I have been generally unmotivated, empty and void. I'd rather do that sober. 

Weekends are tough cause it's 48 straight hours of the whole family home. I've got nowhere to hide. They can see every step of my pain, every struggle to walk, the difficulty sleeping, the insurmountable fatigue. It's embarrassing. 

I truly hope the Lope and kratom and some caffeine pills will help me make it through. It doesn't help that I ran out literally the day before starting my period, so I've got that on top of everything else. 

This really blows. Sorry. Shit post but I don't have anywhere else to whine 👎

I will take 7.5 mg of percs.

I am prescribed Lyrica daily. I dont really want to miss my Lyrica dose. Half life for lyrica is 6-8 hours. Is it alright to take percs after the Lyrica half life is done? 

Respiratory depression is not something i want to f*ck with by mixing the 2 of them. 

Thanks everyone :) ",1524195533.0

Do they get you high? 
Is the high the same as other opiates? Whats the difference between using oxys and using methadone? Should I go woth subs or methadone?

So I’m 1200 miles from home until next Tuesday with my boyfriend, right? Well last night he basically called it off. While I’m 1200 miles away from home.

He said he’s not ready for a guy (we’re gay) in his life at this point and he thought he was. I’m glad he’s learning more about himself, but I wished it wouldn’t have been at my expense. I didn’t see this coming a million miles away. I can’t help but laugh because I should be so used to shit like this happening to me, but it always blindsides me. Maybe I should actually listen when I tell myself to not get involved. Dating is such a waste of time lol

I got really drunk last night and a friend of his held me while I cried. This is why I don’t drink, I embarrass myself.

Had I not been on the shot, getting high would be the first thing on my mind. And honestly, I’m half tempted to see if I can break through the shot. Yeah I know the risks, but I’m past the point of caring.

I gues whenever your life looks perfect, and its too good to be true? It probably is.",1524187977.0
