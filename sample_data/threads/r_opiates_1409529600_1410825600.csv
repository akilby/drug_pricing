I'm leery of the possibility that this feeling is only temporary, but it really doesn't seem that way. There was a part of my trip yesterday that was very dark, but very revealing. I was forced to confront the subconscious sources of stress, anxiety, depression, and fear that I've repressed for years. There was this moment of absolute clarity, where it was revealed to me that the drugs I've been taking to deal with all that bullshit have only made things worse. Despite the relief during the high, and the fact that I've been able to keep my use under control (i.e. not allowing it to damage/compromise my friendships or financial stability), my dependence upon opiates has compounded my issues and insecurities and made me feel even more depressed and worthless over time. 

I have a bunch of pills left, but today I didn't even think about taking them. I just have no desire for them anymore, I almost felt disgusted looking at them. I hate to say it but I'm somewhat ashamed/disappointed at my former self for being so deluded by the high these pills provide, and for having ever assessed my self-worth at such an irrationally low level. It's crazy how different my perspective has become.

I've been taking between 100-200mg of oxy daily for a year, so I'm expecting some withdrawals, but I honestly think I'm done with the stuff for good. LSD is incredibly powerful. I will respect and admire this drug for all of my life.

**TL;DR** - Took ~300mcg LSD, perspective shifted, analyzed subconscious issues and drug use, might be done with opiates for good.",1409536938.0

I know on my 6th days kicking cold turkey I would rescheduling , but as this is my first time using anything stronger than an aspirin to ease the pain . Will it be different ?

It's ok, it keeps me feeling normal, but I have been trying so desperately to catch a buzz here and there.

I did a fat point this morning before my first strip and it had little to no effect. 

The other night, I tried banging two roxy 30's and felt some sedation, but it wasn't worth 40 bucks. 

Will I just not feel opiates any more? Is it just time for me to come to grips with this? I don't really have a choice in taking my subs, my folks give them to me and make sure I take them, which I understand. They love me and want me to be better, and so do I... But just every now and then it'd be nice to get a rush or buzz. Any ideas ladies and fellas? Would orally or sniffing blues make a difference? Could dillys break through the subs?  I'm not even going to bother with percs or hydro, that shit hasn't been worth Jack shit for years to me as it is lol. 

Oh, these 1mg kpins are great to give me a quick lift (and seriously help with the depression :)) but I'm just about out of them. And don't worry, I only take 1mg at a time. Xanax just outs me to slizzeep.

Bend the foil a different way? I'm inhaling through a hollowed out pen, or something, to try and get as much smoke as possible while I light up. My plug, who showed me whats up to begin with, lit it for me the first time and that for sure felt better. I'm definitely not going the IV route, not particularly fond of needles, and I'm not for bumping that ish either. I'm coming from a norco/roxy(30) background.

well after three months away i feel different. i feel like ""take it or leave it"" now, theres no crushing urge, although admittedly i was looking forward to having some brown as a treat, i was hoping to keep it to once a week or less (probably bullshit but i had good intentions). 

well when i got back i found out that all three of my dealers are out of the game. one of them decided he didnt want to do it anymore and also told me that the other two were coming off it themselves and thats why they werent either. this is probably a good thing for me.
the only thing is, i now actually have to sort my life out, because doing nothing and having nothing real to look forward to is boring as shit when im sober, haha. the only reason i tolerated it for a whole year was because i had heroin to make it feel like it wasnt a shitty way to live. now i gotta find myself a job and get out of the house! any tips? ive been using kratom a little, it doesnt do much though! has anyone else been in the same boat (loss of connections taking the decision to quit away from you)? were you ok with it after a while?",1409602157.0

SL every three weeks I go to my doctor and get 3 weeks worth of 8mg subs (21 total),  plus 3 weeks worth of 2mg xanax bars (twice a day,  so 42 bars) 

Plus... And here's the problem... I get 30 mg adderall twice a day... 21 instant release,  21 extended release 

Last Fri there was a computer error sending the scripts to my pharmacy electronically (to cvs,  and they are horrible pill maxis who lie and don't care and I hate thm) 

Bit half my addy script whet through,  and some of the others didn't... So i go there and pick up. My xanax, my subs,  and all they have is 21 adderall xrs 

So i go back to my doc,  she says there was a computer problem... And she wrote me hard copies for all my adderall... 21 instant,  21 xr.... (even though I already picked up the 21 xrs) 


So I have everything I'm supposed to have... But i also have a hard copy prescription for 21 more adderall xrs

How can I go about filling this?  Any ideas.... I'd like to sell a few bevause I'm broke... They go for at least $10 each around here..... Plus I'd like to have the extras just in case for whatever reason or I feel like taking an extra one on some days 


But cvs wouldn't let me when I came back and said ""you just filled this earlier today,  we're not filling this.... I made up a story...  As polite as possible told them about the computer problem... And said my dr just upped my dose to 3x a day (this is also the first time I've ever got the instant,  or always been on xr 2x a day... So the story made sense... But they still said no and told the Dr to call the pharmacy 

I told them she's gone until Tuesday (3 day weekend holiday)  but they didn't care 


Then I went to rite Aid,  have then my insurance card,  they were about to fix it and then said ""oh the computer is say8ng your insurance is saying  you just filled this somewhere else earlier today,  we can't fill this"" 


I told them they sane story (which was part8ally true... The only lie is that my dose didn't actually get increased lol.. She just  accidentally wrote my the script for my adderall xr twice


So anywho... How/where  in the flying fuck can I fill this thing somehow? 

I know I could sell 10 for 100 bucks easy.. Anf still have 10 for myself to have as extra. 

And cvs won't let me do a partial fill because it's schedule ii or sonething... You have to fill it all at once there... I dunno if every pharmacy has the same policy

Also i think i can pay out of pocket without using my insurance at some big name place... But from what I hear adderall is very very expensive... Upwards of $200 for the 21 pills the script is for. 

Should I try a little mom and pop pharmacy? Any ideas?  Or is this perfection just flat out useless to me (it's cleary printed witmy name and address on it.. But it's legit... Anf the Dr has no one of knowing if i filled it twice... It's just a matter of how do I fill it? ",1409588772.0

8 months ago I totaled my car and got a severe whiplash injury. I have no health insurance so I files a PI claim. My attourney sent me to a chiro. Xray read reverse/straightened cervical spine. Wasn't in much pain. Probably steady 2-3. The chiro sucked to b honest. Withdrew me after three.months. 
Then two months ago, after no treatment since April, I started getting tingling in my upper extremities and severe pain more so near the base of my skull. Got MRI and I have bulging disks and 2mm spinal stenosis in my C5-C6-C7. Was referred to an ortho surgeon and he read my MRI and said he is unsure why the.tingling is there, and said I don't need surgery as of yet. However my pain is now at a steady 5 and an 8 on bad days. He referred me to a PM doctor who actually works out of the same office. 

I hate needles and will most likely refuse injections. And I have no current prescribed medications since I don't have insurance. So everything for PM will go through my PI claim. Is it possible the PM doc will prescribe me painkillers on my first visit? My neck randomly cracks and crinkles all day. Random headaches. I can't be very active because I get vertigo and get pale and almost blackout when walking too fast. They don't seem to know what's causing that either. I don't want them to think I am exaggerating so how should I go about this?

Thank you for any help provided!!

I just discovered this via an imageboard devoted to opiates (I'll let y'all guess that one) and it makes for some good reading. I don't have to deal with the pharmacy to get my drug of choice but I'll be damned if I don't see a lot of people here and elsewhere desperately bitch about the process. I'm sure a lot of it is warranted but this is an interesting look at the other side of things. Apparently, we don't always make the best customers. If you're having trouble with your pharmacist, maybe this will give you some insight into why and maybe what you can do to make things easier on both sides of the transaction.

There have been very few posts this year, but plenty of a backlog to keep you busy for awhile.

edit: Also, gives you an idea of how things at the pharmacy work and what certain procedures are. I've seen a lot of posts on here asking for advice from people who probably don't have a good idea how stuff there works, so this might prove to be a useful resource for you pharm junkies!

On Sunday night i took 3 5mg codeine because my long term crush came over and wanted to be chill. I got a great buzz and was supper warm. Had my fun and moved  onto the next day. 

 its Monday night and my favorite twitch streamer was on so i decided i wanted to have a good time. I got this great moonshine from down south but i had class at 11 am so i didnt want to go to school hungover, so i thought i mine as well have a nice afterglow. 

So i take 30mg of my oxy (im notoriously lightweight with every substance but i felt like because i used last night it wouldn't be so bad) After an hour or so i start feeling really good, a little later i get the ""nods"" i hear so much about. its 3 in the morning and i decide its time for bed. At this point its hard to sleep because the pleasure is so great.

So i wake up late after sleeping through my alarm. i rush out of bed get some clothes on and get driven to class. i was in such a rush i had no idea how high i was until i had finally sat down. luckily it was a morning class so i hope people thought i was just sleepy.

I also should throw this in: how long does this method get you high? I really dig the ""high all day"" from OPs but if the coke method lasts like at least 4-5 hours I'll be in the clear.

I'm probably just gonna do the 80 (maybe more) because based off of what you guys are saying 40 won't do anything.

Just moved out west coast so i've switched to shooting BTH. A lil cheaper but obviously not as good or versatile as the quality ECP I used to get.

1. any general tips/differences shooting BTH? I've shot up powder maybe 10-15 times over the course of a couple months. I shot up BTH for the first time tonight(went well!).

2. The rush was pretty nice(did like .35) but it didn't last as long as ECP. Is this normal?

3. How bad is this for my veins? I'm pretty damn good at self control, usually only shooting up when I know I can 110% afford it and I don't have shit to get done. However, I heard it's muuuuch worse for your veins. Will I be cool if I shoot it maybe 2-3 times a week for a month or so? I plan on slowly weening off

He has registered properly and will often check and recheck to make sure the shot is registered. Sometimes the reactions form at the injection site AND at random spots and other times there's just a random reaction.

Are his arms shot out and the load simply leaks out previous injection sites? Is it capillaries that have burst while injecting when still tied off? He takes care to rotate spots/arms and shoot clean, but as of late, this has begun to happen increasingly more often. They end up going away within a few hours but how can my friend prevent this from happening and what is causing this.

So guys, I was getting the weirdest sensation in my ear, almost like when you plug your nose and pop your ears but it would happen randomly. I was driving with a friend when I first noticed it and I thought it was the radio fucking up because it was so unusual, not my ears.

Doc says I'm suffering from Ototoxicity, which is literally ear poisoning. You get it from a good number of opiates and other pharmies. Basically my hearing is fucked and it looks permanent. 

Yesterday an old friend I lost touch with got a hold of me to tell me her brother got an infection from shooting up into his arm that spread throughout his body and into his heart. On top of that they were both diagnosed with Hep C even though they didn't share needles, they just weren't completely clean every single time they were banging. 

So I get on /r/opiates today to talk about these things and find out that one of the communities members has passed away, (rest in peace DTK). 

I made a throwaway for this post but just to detail my past use I've been messing around with recreational opiates on and off for 6 years. I've done pretty much every opiate there is to do and my favorites have been H, tramadol, and Oxy OC. Today I'm leaving the community for good. All I want to say is weigh the risks. I wont nag you, I'm just going to be a reminder. I lost my hearing, my friend's brother might die from his infection, and we lost a member this week. While none of this should be surprising to most of you, I am surprised if you aren't a little taken aback. If nothing else I urge you to spend 5 minutes thinking about your use, and whether or not you think it's worth the risk.

*Waiting*, the process of delaying action until something else happens. I fucking hate waiting. I often feel like I have spent my entire life waiting. Another phone call, another mimicry of self-control, and then the landslide as it happens all over again. *Fuck, where is he?* Sometimes I think I've been waiting since birth. After all, they often compare a high to being in the womb. A soft embrace of comfort and nothing. Waiting is the long trial that one must go through to grab that moment of nothing. That's exactly what it is too, nothing. You always feel like you have finally grabbed it, for that fleeting second of knowledge, before it dissolves into a slow melt that plasters a smile on your face and leaves you glued to the floor for hours. I hate that I always get too anxious and end up picking at my skin. I look like one of the tweaks, leaving pinpoint red marks on my arm where I had started to pinch the skin. *Jesus, I'll blame it on the withdrawal.* I had been sitting at this park bench for two hours now, just waiting. Waiting for Daniel to return so I could flee this damn park and never come back. He had left two and a half hours ago with promise of return within the hour. One hundred and eighty minutes later here I am picking at my skin and kicking at painfully obvious orange caps in the grass. Just another day. Another day full of waiting.

2fhuwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2fhuwn/heartbreak/,8,https://redd.it/2fhuwn,furpadurp18,Heartbreak.,"As any other day I get home from a long day from work. Lately I have been trying to get away from doing heroin. I have been using subs and I've only used once in the past week, but today I was looking to score. As I was waiting for an answer back from my dealer my aunt shows up to my house.

She had called my mom earlier and asked to come see me because she found something in her sons room and she didn't know what it was. She got up to the door and handed me a snuff can, I opened it and I saw a couple empty stamp bags and some foil. I really did not want to say the dreaded word ""Heroin"". My cousin has had an oxy problem before so it's not a total surprise to her, but when I told her that it was heroin the heartbreak in her eyes just wanted to make me cry. It makes me question why I even do this shit. Seeing my family in pain like that is just unbearable to me.

I understand that this is nothing compared to her finding her son OD'd in his room but we are a very tight knit family and no one wants to hear their son is doing dope. I tried my best to explain to her that heroin is no different than oxy, just cheaper. I told her what to say to him when she confronted him about it. She is very trusting of me when it comes to this stuff because I was in rehab 4 years ago and as far as everyone else knows they think I've been clean this whole time. (I'm a scumbag). But seeing that pain in her eyes was enough to make me ignore my dealer when he texted me back. I just don't want the shit today. How could I be so hypocritical to go out and stick a needle in my arm after all this? 

I really just want to be clean, so fucking bad. It takes effort and tragedy to get there though i'll tell you that.

1) Let's say a person does MMT successfully for 5 years, eventually weans off and stays clean from everything for another couple months.  Then, whoops!  Relapse into IV heroin, eventually back to the same level of use they were at before MMT.  From here, let's say after some time of using again (1-2 years) they want to try MMT to get clean again.  Would this second have the potential to be as much or more effective than the first time?  Or would it be much more difficult due to tolerance and the previous long exposure to methadone?

2) I've heard that after some time, methadone will stop producing the high people tend to experience after the first few months in most users.  Also, it becomes harder/impossible to get high from other opiates recreationally.  I've heard that one of the only ways to get any sort of opiate high at this point is to take some benzos before your dose.  How effective would this be, and are there other ways to get the buzz back?

Now, I'm asking these from a hypothetical standpoint.  I have been clean since getting on a withdraw-free dose from methadone and intend to stay that way.  Even though I have been experiencing cravings from time to time at night, I'm hoping to increase my dose so that the cravings will stop and I will continue to be drug-free.  I'm just asking these because I'm curious, and I like to know a lot of info about things I'm getting into.  These are some Qs that I've had trouble getting answers to, and I think that anecdotal responses would be highly beneficial.  If you can shed any light on these, thanks a bunch!",1409849216.0

It's been about 3 days since the increase to 55, so I'm gonna put in a request for another uppage cause I still start to feel kinda shitty in the evening.  Gotta wait for the doc to approve the request so i won't go up until at least Monday.

Anyway, I'm thinking about doubling up on my dose tomorrow (clinic is closed Sunday so everybody gets a take-home Saturday).  I'm still getting cravings at night which sucks, plus I'd like to see if I can get a nice buzz like when I first got up to 50mgs.  Plus I figure that since the half-life is roughly 24hrs it'll be like I took my dose when scheduled this weekend anyway.

He hadn't had any oxy for like 9 months, and he quit heroin three months ago. He gets 80 milligrams of methadone daily and hasn't used anything on top until earlier this week...

This was last sunday, I think. He had been drinking white grapefruit juice all day (and a few days before that). After he had taken his methadone, we went to his place where he showed me 9 MS Contin  tablets (100 milligrams each!) that he had obtained from some guy. He then proceeded to remove the coating, crushed the tablets using two spoons, poured the powder in a glas of white grapefruit juice, and drank the whole thing. That's 900 milligrams of morphine sulphate!

He then proceeded to sit back in the couch, cracked open a beer, downed a few benzo's (I think it were two lorazepam tablets of 2.5 mg each, although I'm not sure) and smoked some cigarettes. He was nodding pretty hard, and of course I kept checking up on him. If I would have had any reason to believe he was in real trouble, I would've called the ambulance immediately. I spent the night (of course I haven't slept at all that night) at his place because I was so concerned, but the morning after he awoke just fine.

Now he got his hands on 60 (!!!) pills of oxycodone, 80 milligrams EACH! They're not OxyContin, they're generics from Sandoz. He told me yesterday he is planning on taking them all at once because he wants to ""relive that high like in the old days"". That's 4800 milligrams of oxycodone! He's planning on using the exact same method as he did with the morphine (crushing them and pouring the powder into a glass of white grapefruit juice, which he has been drinking all day for a week now (according to my friend, that stuff builds up in your system, so drinking it just once or twice doesn't do much) and which he will also be drinking in large amounts on the day he will ingest those 4800 milligrams of oxy. He's not even bullshitting me, he showed me the box (it was one box of 60 pills of extended release oxycodone, 80 milligram).

The box looked like this, only the colors or different and the pills are 80 mg instead of 20 mg: http://www.lekarna-doktorka.cz/pharmdata/obrazek.php?pdk=4030855408481

Is this even possible to do this without dying? Or is it possible that his tolerance is so high that he just gets a extreme high, like with the MS Contin pills? I've tried to talk him out of it (like I did with the morphine as well), but to no avail. To make matters worse, he has some (not that many, but still at least one strip) of some benzo lying around, and he ALWAYS combines alcohol and benzodiazepines with his opioids. He is also thinking about ingesting two doses of his methadone (because he gets his weekend supply – so 120 milligram of methadone on top of that other shit) to make things worse, but it seems like I've talked him out of that. The fact is: he's so unpredictable and I wouldn't be surprised if he DOES take them after all...

Any tips on how I should handle this situation would be VERY welcome.

He's planning on doing this sunday evening, by the way. I already have plans that evening, but I think I have no other option than to cancel them. I could never forgive myself if I let someone die when I could have prevented it.

Thanks to all who are willing to help me out on this one!

Which may not be completely true in all cases but I understand the jist of it I think. It seems as though every time I 'announce' the fact that I am getting off of opiates it puts me in a position of pressure. It makes me feel like the fact that I have told others has some bearing on my resolve to quit, when in fact this might just be a function of ego. I see a lot of posts on here declaring that someone is done and never coming back ""it's been a good ride but goodbye"" that kind of thing and I can't help but think this isn't the best way to go about it. It makes the relapses feel worse and I can't even enjoy my DOC. I find it better to make a more generalized resolve that encompasses opiate use as well such as ""I am going to try to be more healthy"". If I keep telling myself that or even go as far as ""I am going to be more healthy"" rather than ""I am going to get off opiates for good"" it seems as though the pieces fall in to pace more readily. I will start eating better and exercising and the opiate use becomes a simply a 'symptom' of my unhealthyness (rather than the entirety of my goal). I think this has an effect on my resolve as it seems as though the weight of quitting isn't quite as heavy (albeit it is still harsh and fucking sucks). I don't know.. kind of just rambling here.

Long story short, I spent the better part of an hour crawling around like a dumbass on my hands and knees looking all under my bed, next to the dresser, then going places that I know for sure I didn't bring the tar. I start to get closer when I notice some familiar brown smudges on my bed ...

finally, it occurred to me that there was still literally once place I hadn't checked yet. yup, it was *FUCKING STUCK TO MY ELBOW !!!*

By the end of the night it was hurting so bad I had to leave work early. At first I didnt think much about it. I work a pretty active job, always on my feet and constant movement for 10 straight hours a night. I figured I just pulled something.

after a week or so it started to get alot better, almost going away completely after two weeks until about a week ago now the pain came back and is very intense. Its not in my chest this time but just in my shoulder/collar bone area. I have a high tolerance for pain and this mother fucker hurts bad. I can barely take my shirt off or anything

what worries me, is this is the arm that I have been primary shooting in for months now. While I use to use both arms I started only using my right 99% of the time for a while now. I have been iving pills for over 5 years now and have never had a problem from it before, though for the past 4 or 5 months I switched to mostly morphine,  only doing roxys when I run out and cant find any. Before that I mostly did roxys and just morphine here and there, but have found that its much cheaper and that on it I can actually afford my habit every week and not just stay unsick but actually get high every day, and have came to like it even better now.

like I previously said, if it was my other arm hurting,  I would think twice about it, but since its my shooting arm, im worried it could be an infection or something in it. I have heard of infection before at the site of the injection but thats it. I was wondering if anyone on here has heard of getting one in the shoulder,  or if im just being a bitch and stressing over nothing. I have since been hitting myself in my left arm now for the past several days. 

One last thing to add, to anyone else that does morphine they should know what im talking about. Immediately after doing a shot and releasing the belt, before the rush, I can alway feel it going thru my shoulder first. Its like a tingling feeling like the pins and needles feeling you get thru out your body, but still kinda differnt.its like a slight pain that last a few seconds every shot. Anyways was wondering if that could have something to do with it, because of being repeatedly done several times a day.

sorry to ramble, I just got back home from picking up, and this has been on my mind alot. Any input would help. More than likely its prolly work related, but because I have been a iv user for years now, any health issue stresses me out if I think it could be realated to my use. Thanks",1410062215.0

If you don't have the money to go to the doctor, talk to some of your plugs. I've found that a lot of people I mention gabapentin to happen to have it and have no idea what its about.

I took 5, 300mg tablets last night when I had done a bunch of blueberries just hours before. It takes 2 hours to peak and the moment 2 hours went by I felt like I had to go to sleep. I slept from 2 am till 1pm, which I would never do. I usually sleep for about 4 hours, wake up, and want to get high. When I was on the gabapentin all I wanted to do was sleep. When I was up and about I felt great. I did things around the house that I wouldn't dare do unless I had already done something. I am planning on getting off opiates for the next 3 weeks and I don't plan on taking anything like lope or any of those popular come downs. 

I do have to point out that there is, I guess, a minor chance that this will just lead to another dependance. I doubt it though because I have been taking gabapentin on a recreational basis for 2 years. I have come off it for various periods of times, with no noticeable withdraws, unless they blended in with my opiate withdraws which I doubt. 

TL:DR: Gabapentin makes me feel a shit ton better while not on opiates. I recommend giving this a try if your having trouble getting off shit. I took 5, 300mg @8:pm, and 18 hours later I still feel buzzed.(Buzzed like relaxing alcohol head high, with floaty body euphoria. ",1410036012.0

I've got the write up, I just need to get it all scanned and throw it up on the site for you guys so you can give it a try if interested. 

Back to the OD story. So I had been clean for 8 weeks, was feeling good, and really excited for me and my 5 buddies annual fishing trip to my friends island. Theres no building so we stay in tents and use an outhouse. The island is tiny and its a 45min boat ride to the nearest marina, and a 2 hour drive to the hospital from there. No cell service on the island either.

I decided to bring some H with me. It had been 8 weeks since my last use but I wanted to treat myself so I brought a gram. Once I got there within 20 minutes I was shooting up. My friends aren't users so I decided to inject in the outhouse to keep it away from them. I get in the outhouse and inject a quarter. 

As soon as it hits me I get this huge ripping pain in my chest. I breath out but I cant breath in. It's like trying to breath through a straw. I stand up and before I can make it to the door to unlock it, I collapse. I remember looking up at the top of the outhouse thinking; Fuck, I'm going to die in an outhouse. Thats some redneck Elvis Prestly shit right there.

So my friends realize I've been gone a while and come to get me. I don't answer so they kick the door in. There I am unconscious seizing on the ground.

They each get an arm and a leg and drag me down to the boat, load me in, and drive 40mins to the marina thinking I'm dead. They call an ambulance at the marina and i get picked up.

During the ambulance ride my failing lungs, respiratory depression, and low pulse compounded and my heart failed. It took them 6mins to resuscitate me. 

I woke up again in the hospital with a catheter up my dick and a tube the size of a garden hose down my throat. 

Turns out while seizing I aspirated vomit into my lungs too, which of course got infected and caused my lungs to collapse again 3 days later.

I was in the hospital for 11 days total. It fucking sucked",1410034555.0

That's what we get high on where I'm from. Maybe a few people fuck with scramble but I'm unfamiliar with it. Tar is practically a myth. $60 half gram bags of raw is all I know. The nigs in town won't sell anything smaller.

Basically if we can't scrounge together $60 that day we're fucked. Which is extremely fucking difficult a lot of the time. $50? sorry, gonna be sick today.

2fs0yp,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2fs0yp/intro_wild_weekend/,28,https://redd.it/2fs0yp,TheRespectableJunky,Intro + Wild Weekend,"Greetings fellow opiate enthusiasts! I have been reading this site for several years, and have always loved the people here. I used to (briefly) post under another name, but that account gave away too many details about my job and I deleted it. 

As a way of getting to know each other, here are some details about me: I'm 27/m, I've lived in New York for almost 6 years, I now share an apartment in downtown Manhattan with my fiancee (she is a former finance person who quit her job to become an ER nurse - she's much happier now), and I work in ""investments"" (picking stocks for endowments, pension funds, family trusts,  rich people etc.) 

I have been a regular opiate user and then an addict at least since college. The first 5mg percocet I took in HS after having my wisdom teeth out was (at that point) the most amazing feeling I had ever felt... and from then on, I knew this was gonna be a regular thing. 

Everything changed in mid-college (mine was just outside of Boston) when the old school OC 80s started popping up. That was back in '06/'07/'08 and they were everywhere, and snorting those bad boys was a whole new ballgame.

I won't bore you good people with all of the details of my progression since then but it won't surprise anyone: percs/hydros > oxy 40s/80s > LOTS of the 30mg roxies when the OC's became OP's around '11 > one glorious month where the original Opana 40mg stop signs were everywhere in NY (I still dream about those things; they are my Unicorn) > tried dope for the first time in early '12 > suboxone (I actually stayed with it & had very few slip ups for 10 months, then my boss at the time suggested I either go to business school or move up to a more senior position at another company - none of their sr. guys were leaving and I def felt stuck in a rut where I was.) 

I had at least 6 months with no responsibilities other than finding a job... two months were salaried (even though I didn't have to go in), they gave me a $200k 2012 bonus as a goodwill gesture, and boom, I was back into the dope, HARD (I've never been able to make the leap to IVing but at one point I was snorting 20+ bags just to catch a nod.) I seriously considered moving out to SF for a job (thank God I didn't - TL is the easiest place on earth to score when I've been there on business) but somehow I got lucky and I ended up with a great job here in NYC.

The new job is super chill so thankfully I've gotten away with a few things, but all in all I have gone out of my way to separate work from using. We set a date for our wedding (next August at an awesome place in Hudson Valley), and after going on subs again for a few months, doing a quick taper and spending a week in Europe drying out with NO substances in my body - I came back feeling great. My new goal is no more suboxone and trying to save the dope for very special occasions and/or doing it infrequently enough that I don't have to deal with physical WDs. I know that sounds like a recipe for failure but hey, gotta try something at this point, and I finally feel like I'm in the headspace to attempt it. I apologize for the wall of text, but I wanted to give you guys a coherent picture of myself before I jumped in.

My intro story is this: my fiancee and I are close friends with a group of girls and guys (26-31) who live in an amazing loft in the village. My fiancee was working a night shift at the hospital (7pm to 7am, and because it's in the Bronx she has a 1+ hour subway ride each way) last night, and my main guy friend in that apartment was away at a wedding. So one of the girls called me and asked if I wanted to come over and hang (this was about 6pm.) I was down, so I brought a nice salad/salsa (hard to describe but it was delicious), a decent bottle of red wine, and a couple random liquor bottles from the summer bar that were nearly empty (gin, vodka, Patron etc.) 

I get there and see the other couple that she lives with on the couch. This is good because I like both of them: the dude is a very tall preppy guy from Michigan that the ladies love (and he loves drugs), and the girl works in fashion - she's not only really hot, but also quite smart and interesting to boot. 

So we have some drinks, and the girl who invited me over offered to sell me some pills. Now this chick is a walking pharmacy: on top of her ADD, anxiety and sleeplessness, she has also had at least 3 major surgeries on he back, knee and hip. Of course I'm down, and I end up getting 7 5mg vicodin (not the greatest but might hold me on a bad day), 4 10mg Adderall (+1 free one, which I blew then & there), 10 Valium, and 10 Ativan, all for $100. I pop one of the Valium, we keep drinking, I smoke a bowl with the other girl's boyfriend before he leaves for work (he also has a 10pm-8am night job at a 24 hour news channel.) 

I am feeling pretty good (especially after downing a shot of the Patron & some wine) and we decide to meet up with another girl who has been friends with me since high school at a little bar/restaurant around the corner. We kept it together at dinner but order more drinks and tons of filthy food (mac & cheese with pulled pork??) After dinner, the new girl has to bounce, and the two roommates ask me if I know any coke dealers. I haven't done coke in about a year and (surprisingly) none of my dope guys really sell it (or at least they don't advertise)... it's one of those things I'lll happily do if it's there, but rarely go out of my way to buy it. That's dope money, son!

So the girls say they'll split some with me and sure enough, my old molly guy recently texted saying he just got out of prison and happens to have some fire coke (normally I'd be sketched out but his brother & GF made it known that they would serve me while he was in, and the dude is a standup guy.) So he comes by impressively quickly, we buy 2 $100 bags, and it's off to the races. 

Now maybe I haven't done blow in forever or maybe this stuff was just quite good (that's what the other two said) but I was in outer fucking space. Hours of coke babble went by, we watched Half Baked (or it was at least on in the background), and listened to a ton of good 80s music... all while finishing the red wine and a full bottle of some sort of Norwegian berry flavored vodka. 

We totally lost track of time, and finally one of the chicks (the hot one) decided she wanted to meet a friend out a a bar even though it was close to 3am. The other two of us were wayyy too yipped up (and too old) to join her, but I gave her the rest of one of the bags to bring and was rewarded by her changing in front of us & spending a good 5 minutes walking around in her bra & tiny thong (she even did a line in that getup!) 

She left, the other girl and I smoked and she asked if she could pay me for her share of the coke with another 25 Ativan... I said absolutely. The pot kicked in hard (as did the 2nd valium I popped) and I managed to stumble home to my apartment. I passed out, full clothes on, sitting up on my couch... which is where my fiancee found me when she came home at 8:30am (her response was an eye-roll, a bit of jealousy that she wasn't there, and some very heartfelt excitement to see me because she had missed me all night.)

I made us some scrambled eggs with goat cheese and peppers, brewed a pitcher of ice tea, and we had a nice little breakfast before going back to bed for several hours. I woke up at 1 or 2pm but she kept sleeping because she had to work again tonight (Sunday.) While she was napping I miiiiiiight have hit a few lines of the leftover coke while I watched my Dolphins come back against the Pats... it was worth it.

She headed back to work, I popped an Ativan and showered, and her mother (who is staying with us for the night while here on business) showed up around 8pm and had a lovely dinner/conversation with me. 

Now, for the perfect end to the weekend: my dope dealer called and said he's going to be out of town for the next week, so he was going to bring me a few bundles before he leaves. He arrived around 10pm, and while it's good D for sure, my tolerance is WAY down (or maybe it's the benzos?) and I am ripped off 5 bags. Before you get into the dangers of combining them: I almost never mix them, I have narcan in the medicine cabinet, and someone is here (although far from an ideal person) if something does happen.

Sorry for the LONG post but I am so glad to be part of this community now - you all rock! What did everyone else get into this weekend?",1410148159.0

I had zero comfort meds (other than spending time with my family and dogs seemed to help. Probably because I've been isolating for such a long time.)  
  
At first I would describe the sickness as moderate, learning towards mild (You can generally go to work with mild symptoms) I also felt better as the day wore on. Nauseated, sore, general malaise, and lack of an appetite. But I soldiered through, feeling pitiful for myself the whole time haha. 

So, sweet, I'm FINALLY opiate free, but uh-oh, my subs refill and the addict in my brain was all like ""YOU BETTER TAKE THOSE MOTHERFUCKING PILLS OR I WILL RIP OF YOUR TESTICLES!!!"" In my mind I planned on selling them which I sold quite a few, but I also started doing them again because know they gave me abuse... for a while.  
  
**So here is my plan and here's what I've got:**  
Suboxone to taper with  
Klonopin for anxiety/sleep  
Ambien sleep  
Lope if needed  
**Considering DXM but not sure. Could someone shed some light on DXM for use in opiate withdrawal?**  
  
I've been tapering down reasonably quickly (<.25mg) and I'm at a point where I have roughly 15 doses left. I'm not sure of the mg because I cut the pills into the size of.. I unno a few grains of sand wetted together. I mean these are small. Pencil point small. All I can tell you *for sure* is that they are smaller than .125mg. Anything else is just conjecture. Luckily, it takes a very minute amount of sub to keep me pretty much symptom free.  
  
Now I know this is looked down on in this reddit, but I smoke this little pebbles one at a time so that I can know instantly if its working and if so I can leave what's left for next time and have just that much more.  
  
**ANYWAY**, enough of the backstory and on to the question. What do you guys think would be the best way to consume my meds to negate as much withdrawal as possible.  
  
I've been considering that I either go at these miniscule doses, sometimes even making them smaller with nail clippers, and hope that's enough weaning.  
  
My second thought is to wait three days after my last dose which was tonight and see how I feel and dose accordingly and very sparingly.

Today I'm going to probably have a small cyst (size of b-b gun pellet) removed from an area close to my vaginal wall.  It is usually not bothersome, but has at times gotten so irritated that a hot compress and visit to the doctor and round of antibiotics settles it, but leaves me homebound 1-2 days.  They thought it was an ingrown hair, it isn't.

Whenever I see a doctor I like to try to get a script in case I need it later.  I'm horrible at judging what is appropriate.  My gyno used to treat my adenomyosis with norco 10 quite readily but with the caveat I would need a hysterectomy if it continued - which it did - and I got it - and I am so glad I did.

For a small incision and probably no stitches my guess is they will say take ibuprofen and ""rest."" If I call in after saying it's bothering me, they will just want me to come back in to look at it and see if it looks infected.  At the end of the day if it's a hassle and not worth it, I won't even ask.

This is NOT a bartholin cyst - when I was in and it was inflamed earlier this year they ruled it out.

I'm curious if other ladies have had a small cyst remove (remember, this isn't golf ball size or anything) and what they were provided.

The fact I have no tolerance to opiates means I can get a nice buzz off codeine. Unfortunately when I try to extract codeine from co-codamol pills, it never seems to work properly. 

I tend to drink codeine linctus which works great, but I have to order this online where as co-codamol pills can be bought anywhere much more easily.

So on my last attempt I filtered 32 8/500s. I crushed them, dissolved the powder in water and then cooled it down. It started to separate in the glass as it was thick at the bottom and more watery towards the top. 

I filter this through wet kitchen towel and I'm left behind with a thick white paste in the filter. 

In the glass I'm left with a clear liquid that tastes very bitter, so it appears to have worked. 

This solution should contain over 200mg of codeine, but it had almost no affect. I did feel something, but I feel much more from swallowing two co-codamol and two Nurofen + (41.6mg).

I know it's pathetic that I'm staying with my parents, but I've had some complicated health and wellness issues that I couldn't deal with on my own. but holy shit! my mother actually searched my room! I haven't even been using much more than one every couple months. and she did say that she was sure I wasn't using but finding the needles scared her. 

I feel like I'm 15 years old again. it's bad enough that I'm staying with my parents, and now I have to deal with having the last shred of privacy completely nullified.

Anyway almost every time I hit a vein and pull up the plunger, I have to pull the syringe up a little bit before I get that plume of blood. Is this normal? Does this mean I'm going in too deep or something? If so should I use a shorter needle - is anything shorter than a 30 gauge?

And I also don't really feel a rush - although I do feel well immediately. I imagine it's because my tolerance is so high (a bun a day). If I did more at once I'd probably get a rush, but I can't afford to do that. ",1410217756.0

Any of you have your SO find out after a long period (years) of using and keeping them in the dark? How did they react? 

What about the (seemingly rare) case of having an SO who doesn't use, AND is cool with you using?

My story: I'm engaged, and hid my use from my fiancee for quite some time (we've been together for almost 4 years, and I have been a regular user of opiates of one kind or another that entire time.) She knows I used to do a lot of blues, but I told her I ""quit"" even though I kept using and eventually switched to H. There have been plenty of red flags (nodding out, having the ""flu"" way too often) but I ""successfully"" kept her in the dark until a few months ago. Once I was on subs (for the second time) I told her everything, and she was surprisingly cool with it. She is no stranger to partying (used to love coke, and now regularly takes ritalin/vyvanse for both recreation and work/school) ... but she is a nurse, and I assumed she would flip out over the H. On the contrary, she said she knew I was on something but never called me out because it seemed like I had my life together otherwise, and was proud of me for getting on subs & seeing a therapist. Now I am off subs, and we have a deal where she is OK with me using H occasionally, as long as it's not around her or her family and doesn't become a daily thing again (I think not being an IV user helps my case - that would probably be a dealbreaker.) We'll see how this new deal goes...

I was recently with a friend and he used a different method.

Long story, unless you're interested in an odd case of opiate usage and withdrawls just skip to the TLDR. i've been doing opiates on and off for 5ish years. Started with low level pills, moved on to taking more of those, then higher level pills, then dope.

I'd say a year after I started I ""peaked"" with my usage(besides currently). 3ish days a week, usually in a row, sometimes 4 days a week(3 in a row, one not) i'd take oxy(or hydro), 60-90mg/dose the first couple weeks up to 150mg/dose towards the middle-end(usually dose once a day, sometimes twice if my dose was in the AM i'd dose again at like 9pm). Continued this for maybe 8 weeks. Stopped cold turkey, got no withdrawls. Whatever, I was hardly an addict, I was younger, thought nothing of it.

In between(lets say the end of year 2 to the end of year 3) I used randomly. Sometimes i'd get a good cheap connect and have a blast for a week, then stop. No withdrawls. Sometimes i'd go a month or two without a single opiate, then i'd find someone with like 160mg oxy, take that and just have a grand ole time for one night. No withdrawls.

End of year 3 getting into year 4 I got ahold of some china white. A friend of mine tested the first couple bunds we got, was ranging from 50-70% purity, so it was some good shit in my opinion. I was anti-needle at the time so I snorted it, started with a baggy and a half, after a week got to 2.5, after a month got to 5. Then I started shooting. Started shooting 2 baggies, felt great, got up to 4 at my peak. This is about 3 months of use, using 3-5x a week. Couldn't get any for a couple days, and I went through my first withdrawl. Worst fucking time ever. Slight headache, constant chills, coldsweats, couldn't get comfy. The WORST bowel/guts/stomach pain ever and I couldn't eat anything. I could hardly drink any liquids or do jack shit. By far one of the worst times of my life.

Fast forward and i'm on the west coast now. Smoking tar, some decent shit but nothing good. Usually .5 a day. I'd stop cold turkey for a couple days and besides just wanting some, I had no withdrawl symptoms. 

I just started shooting it, same thing. Shot up for 3 days in a row, 4th day had none and had no feelings besides cravings. I'm back on, 8th day in a row shooting up a G a day(dosing 3x a day) and i'm ""quitting"" again tomorrow, cold turkey. We'll see if I go through any withdrawls. 

TL:DR :

Anyway, anyone understand as to why I withdrawl from some opiates and not others, despite similar usage habits?",1410201142.0

They ended up not operating on her and sent her home with medicine including triazolam (for anxiety before coming in on operation day) and 24 hydrocodone pills.  They were the 5/300.  Now she doesn't have health insurance so she wanted the generics to be more cost effective.   The generics however were 5/325.  Not really that big a deal but it kind of irritated me.  Mom told me she was lectured by the dentist for taking to much Tylenol each day for pain (10-15 tablets) which I agree with and she doesn't abuse drugs and will take 1-2 for pain as it label says so she won't feel pain and will in turn ingest a significantly lower amount of Tylenol each day.  However, people who hydros usually take fist fulls at a time if they haven't graduated to something harder but I've never heard of anyone I know overdosing on hydrocodone (not saying it hasn't happened).  I have heard stories of many people hurting their livers due to the large amount of acetaminophen that would come with the pill abuse.  I'm irritated because this occurred last week around the whole schedule 2 thing and I ask myself what the fucking point is?  The OTC is the killer in most situations and they could just make pills with pure hydrocodone in them and doctors could recommend taking a Tylenol with it or something.  The health issues and death could be solved by implementing a regulation in how much acetaminophen can be put in drugs with a potential to cause abuse.  Finally,  it also irritated me that the generics had more acetaminophen in it than the regular.  Let's give the poor people shittier meds.  Sorry for the long post.

Also suggestions for hydro dose is welcome cuz last time I used was about a year ago and most the time Ive been underwhelmed (which always disappoints me).

I work night . I woke up around 8 pm. My main dude I get from works a swing shift so one week he works days and then the next week he works nights. This week hes working days, so when I woke up tonight, its my off day, I knew my dude was already offcwork, but was praying he wasnt already in bed sleeping.

So I called my boy and as soon as he picked up the phone I knew it was to late. I could tell from his voice he was in bed. So he told me I could meet him right before work at 5:30am. Him and I work right across the street from one another so we meet in a parking lot right by our work, which is only about 10 mins from my house. So after talking to him I knew I only had to wait about 10 hours and I would be good.

I wasnt to stressed at first because I didnt feel to bad right then and figured the wait wouldnt be to bad either.....but boy was I wrong. For about the past 3 or 4 months my tolerance has really gone up alot and fortunately I haven't gone with out in this time either for more than a few hours.  This dude gets a script of m 100s but doesn't do them or know anyone besides me thay does, me and him go way back so he trust me. So starting about 4 or 5 months ago he fronts me as much as I need or want and then pay him every 2 weeks on pay day.

so as you can see having this new hook up is what caused my tolerance to sky rocket. Though its been so nice having this guy. Finally I have a hook up that isnt a junkie and doesnt do pills and only has one customer thats me who he trust.  Its made life alot easier and I have felt like alot less of a junkie, because I dont have to fuck around and waste most m5 days looking for shit and coming up with money. I just pick up a 2 week supply or so at once and pay him when I get paid

someti es throw I fuck up and do to much some days and will run out a few days short, like last night. Which I wasnt to upset at first like I said. Honestly I was ki da curious what my withdraws would be like because its been so long since I have had any. Well let me tell you, THEY WERE HORRIABLE. LAST NIGHT FELT LIKE A ETERNITY WHAITING TILL 5:30 THIS MORNING.

when he finally text me a little after 5 and said to leave the house, I was feeling so bad. I had horriable stomah pain and bad diarrhea, I honestly didnt know if I could make the 10 min drive withou shitting myself. It had been since 5:00 pm tuesday before work since my last fix, so about 36 hours. On the way this morning I was smokin a cig going down the road and all of the sudden threw up. I tried to get most of it out the window but I was going about 45mph so most of it came back in all over myself and my car. It was so fucking gross but I didnt even care at the time because my only though was getting to the dope.

finally I got there and got the pills. I stop in another parking lot and fired up. But it was so hard getting them ready because I was so shakey and sweaty and my eyes were watering so bad, it looked like I was crying. And honestly maybe I was crying tears of joy because I was so happy I finally got them. Though that first shot is so hard to enjoy when you are thay sick because you just want it in you and the pain to go away, that you dont get to appreciate it. So as sson as I got back home I didnt another one. This one I can actually enjoy getting it ready and take my time.

so now I am ripped and feeling good, smokin some stoggies and rambling on to you guys, hahaha sorry. I just wanted to sharemy morning with yall. Its funny how bad life can be and then with in mins from a little tiny pill it can completly change. Besides being physically sick, one of the worst part of my wds is depression. I get so, so depressed when im with out. Last night was really bad. It makes the waiting so much worse. I dont want to do anything like watching a movie or something else that would help pass the time. It so hard to explain the feeling

but anyways I gone on enough. So hows everyone else's morning going. Anyone else up getting their fix on?. Hopefully no one else had a night like mine. Everyone let me know what yall are up to? Im bout to eat some breakfast and maybe another shot, ill try to post some pill porn I have never uploaded a pic on here, still kinda new at posting. Then its off to bed, I got to work tonight.

Edit: pill porn from the shot I did after making this post, also side not, I ran out of 1cc rigs a couple days ago but had 2 new bags of 1/2cc rigs so I been using them until I go get some new ones so for every shot I still use 1cc of water but have to use 2 rigs to pull it up. It kinda sucks but hey they still get the job done. The pharmacist fucked up a while ago and gave me the wrong size and I didnt notice till I was already out of the store in my car, but here it is my first pill porn, NSFW  http://i.imgur.com/ujbsn1J.jpg

(Slight bragging story from a dude down on his luck lately),"Potential warning for LONG TEXT depending upon how much my loaded ass (hmm... that sounds questionable) is willing to type. This is actually my second account, first one might be more noticeable to the true OG's of this sub.... /u/reconog.


So today started like any other day. Woke up NOT hurting in my bed at the crack of dawn, for it was the day of all days. The day in which a new chapter in my life would start. The day where all fun would cease to exist and be replaced with a weekly visit to the jolly old probation office, where I would displace my urine in a cup and hope to God I would not fail. As you can imagine I was not exactly pleased. However little did I know everything would change.


So because of my violent felony conviction I was expecting my wonderful probation officer (here on out refered to as PO) to be quite strict, especially on my first day. You know how those cunts wish to be hard asses and love using scare tactics. Instead I came into a pretty nice, down to earth guy who loves soccer *almost* as much as I do. We talked for a bit and my concerns about being tested fell to the wayside. That is, until he reaches into his desk and pulls out the infamous dipstick. FUCK.

So I do my business, hand him the cup and continue to talk, this time at a much different pace, while the dipstick does its job and condemns me to a few days and nights in the wonderful DOC. At the end of it all he grabs the test takes a look at it and throws it in the trash. ""YES"" i'm thinking to myself. He gives me a few dates and sends me on my way. Or so I thought.

As I'm walking out the door he suddenly remembers the most important part of our intake. The fact that I will not be able to transfer my probation to fucking Maryland. See this is extremely disappointing as I left my current state (Delaware) to get clean in the wonderful area of Bel Air. Everything was great for 4-5 months. Clean, Job, Girl, Apt, all that. But then I started to do a lil dope here and there. Still have all these material possessions, barring the house, but with this news I'm in line to lose them all once again. So he sends me on my way and now I'm super bummed. Everything should have worked out and now it didn't.

So I leave probation and head home. After probation I scheduled a meeting with my grand-sponsor (My sponsors sponsor) who is known to give me money from time to time to do some less than legal activities. You can probably guess what happens just from todays luck. No call no show. I was pissed. I called and texted him a hundred time and eventually give up. This sucks, but things must get worse before they get better.


So I scrounged up the little cash I had and called my most reliable (and honestly only connect as I had been living in MD until just monday). No answer. FUCK. Call my other friends one by one. No answer. FUCK. 

So now just to recap. I'm sick, potentially homeless (my parents will not continue to let me stay with them for long), broke AF and tired of all this bullshit. Some 8 or so hours pass until around 6PM when things all take a huge turn for the better. Finally.

I get a phone call from a random number I'd never seen before. You see I didn't pick up the first time because it was a 302 number when I'm actually used to MD area codes. Eventually he calls like 6 times and I reluctantly pick up. It's my God-Brother! And he has started selling dope! And after a few seconds of telling him my situation, he's on his way to me with a half bun for free and two buns on the front.

While he's on the way down (its about an hour and a half drive) I get a call from my grand-sponsor. He needs me to pick up a few things before I take care of some errands for him and he's put $150 in my name and all I need to do is go to western union. Fucking A!

So needless to say, my godbro comes down, picks me up, I get high and mighty, head on over to the wonderful food lion where money seems to just be handed to me magically time and time again.
So lets just fast forward a bit since it feels like I've finished The Winds Of Winter before GRRM.

So its around 4:00 AM in the morning. I'm still high as fuck, practicing tech skill in Super Smash Bros Project Melee in anticipation for a tournament I'll be streaming when I receive ANOTHER phone call from a number I don't know. Whaaaaaat... not cool. I've had ATF roll up to my house at 3:30 in the morning, dogs barking, submachine guns raised. You get the idea.

It's a good friend from high school! He's back in town!


And he's got a gram of coke and destiny.


So now I'm sitting here, running around my basement excited as fuck to finally get some coke in me and play this game that everyones been full chub over for the last year. Sorry for the long ass text guys but when something actually works in your life when these events are few and far between... you gotta brag. Just a lil bit ;].

I've been shooting up dope for the past couple months(been using opis for years though, just not shooting them up til recently). was china white for a while, now its tar.

the tar ive been getting has been pretty damn high quality from a mexican. all has been well except for a weird feeling i just got shooting up like an hour ago.

second shot of the day. did .1 at like 5pm, feelsgoodman(nodded once for about 3 seconds roughly 10 seconds after injection, then was just super high for 5 minutes, then normal but still good high for duration). got home, relaxed, did a second shot of .15 at 715ish. instantly my whole body(first my head, then a millisecond after my body) gets first a non painful but slightly alarming burning sensation, then not even half a second later i get itchy as fuck(again, most notably my head). i of course scratched(very lightly, mostly more hair and a little face/neck action), i think it helped.

im not 100% sure but i think this happened to me once before shooting tar, but i dont remember because i think i was either drunk or had taken xanax. if it did happen before, i know for sure it wasnt this intense.

so if anyone knows what it was/why it happened/how it happened/how to make it not happen again/am i gonna die/was it a good thing/etc please let me know! always much appreciated, happy and SAFE SAFE SAFE nods!

I think that the chart is referring to 100% pure heroin and doesn't take into consideration the fact that in reality, the dope we get can be as low as 10% pure, sometimes less. I feel that in order to prevent any possible OD's, that chart should get changed. I don't want to ignore the possibility that some kid who's been doing heroin one day acquires some other pharmaceutical opiate and accidentally OD's because he used the opioid comparison chart and took too many of that opiate.

hey guys, just a quick stamp report for any of my NJ heads. alright guys, these bags are great a solid 7/10. I just wanted to let you guys know in case anyone comes across it, so none of y'all over-do it. 

Stamp is red 24k, I've had these a couple months ago too. The size of the bags is really good too , although the pictures don't do it justice. The legs are pretty good also. I usually don't stay high long at all , or nod out but I did one of these two hours ago and still feel it. 

Also, the rush. Usually I do two or three bags to get a rush and nice high. I did one of these and got a nice rush and I'm pretty decently high.

I just thought I'd let you guys know to be safe, I wouldn't want anything to happen to anyone ! So yeah,hope everyone is having an awesome night and be safe out there!",1410399031.0

But I'm curious because I've ped egged a 20 after plugging the 2 dillies with  some of the ER scrappings I'm feeling pretty good but I'm curious if I'm really getting much from the lines I've sniffed with a bit of water after to help with absorption. Now I'm curious if my high is mainly from the 2 dillies and opana scraps or if the sniffing is actually worth it. I've had some vodka so I'm not completely sure if it is adding to the high or not. I usually eat them chewing up with some vodka since I get them 10 a piece. Compared to just a 30 roxi. I have 1 whole 20 mg and a bit more then half and wonder if sniffing is worth it or if I should plug or eat. 

I'm just asking since my high is comprised of more then just the opanas. I don't wanna waste me sniffing when I could do something better with them",1410391141.0

The last few days I have been trying to get back on. With no luck. The universe keeps throwing me hurdles.,"Quick recap. I was a daily opiate addict from 16-24. I have been to rehab 8 times, inpatient detox 11 times, jail for 5 months once; I have tried methadone and suboxone numerous times. Finally in November of 2012 I kicked for good in rehab and have been off ever since. I stayed completely sober up until about four weeks ago when I smoked pot a few times. In the time I stayed completely sober I gained an amazing high paying job, a car, my own place, my family talks to me, I have great new friends, I have had two amazing relationships with beautiful girls, but something changed recently...

I can't stop thinking about throwing it all away. Like I don't deserve any of this, and that I need to self destruct as soon as possible. I made the decision to start doing dope again about 4 days ago. I am in a new city (Seattle) where I have about two friends, and an ex-girlfriend. The two friends couldn't help, so I started driving around the city looking for ""the spots"". I found them; pioneer square and 1st& Pike. I got out and walked around some very obvious drug dealers, and no one approached me like they used to. The next day I went by the needle exchange and just waited to see if anyone came in or out. For about an hour there were only two junkies who went in there, and they said it seemed too much like a setup.

I know I have the capability to stop this before I start but my head won't leave me alone on this one. Can anyone relate? Two years away from the torture and horrors of IV heroin addiction, and out of nowhere (well not completely, I have had some trauma recently), all I want to do is get back on it ASAP...

I can't seem to find any relevant information anywhere.

I had back problems throughout college, which I coped with using prescribed vicodin (5/500s) for a couple of years. My doctor would usually give me a script for either 90 or 120 pills at a time. I'd take between 3-6 per day until they ran out, wait a few more months, and go get a new script.

Here's the part that's always made me wonder...one of the re-fills I got just felt *off*. I don't know how to describe it. It didn't make me feel nauseous, but I was definitely on the verge. It helped me deal with the pain, but I just felt gross mentally. Every pill in the bottle was this way.

At the time, I just thought it was my body changing how it reacted to the vicodin.

But, when that bottle ran out and I eventually got another refill, everything was back to normal. It was like I was given a bad batch before.

Is this something that can happen? Can pharmacies pump out a bad batch of something like that? They were generics, but I'm not sure if that has anything to do with anything. I always got the generics.

It's always made me wonder. I don't know if anyone here has experienced anything similar. This had to have been, oh, 2007 or so.",1410488224.0

I'm a working professional in SF.  To put it simply, opiates make me feel like myself, this goes beyond withdrawal symptoms or getting high.  If I want to get high I'll get some coke and do a speedball.

So I gave methadone a solid go, first through a city program which basically only works for people that don't have a job or any other kind of obligations.  Then I acquired it elsewhere, it worked -- kinda made me feel like shit, but worked.  There were a lot of side effects, but the most severe was how it made me sweat.  Really bad, I'd be sitting on the train, just sitting there, and I'd be visibly sweating -- clothes would be soaked and sweat would be dripping down my face.  At work I'd need a heavy duty fan on me the entire day.  It was awful.  I tried adjusting my dose, eventually tapering down pretty low, to 10mg in the morning 10mg at night, still the same symptoms.

So went back to heroin, which works with none of those sweating sides but costs a fortune.. ($30 - 40k a year).  There are some other issues with that but thats beyond the scope of this post.

I want to give suboxone a go, I'm just worried about the sides.  I don't want to have it on my insurance, and I hear its pretty expensive.  Nowhere near how much my H habit costs of course.  I've heard people say they have bad sweats on sub too.

Can't find any info I know food safe pg vg are used in benzo solutions but the flavoring weirds me out. Any ideas would be useful. Thanks guys. ",1410458985.0

Anyway, a colleague told me: this kid went to the movies and had a slush puppy (crushed ice with flavouring & water). On the way home the parents noticed something was off (I don't have more details on this but it was mentioned, so I'm including it).


Next day, he goes to school (he's 16 or so) - 7:30am in South Africa, and around 9 - 9:30am the school phones the parents - ""something's wrong with your kid"". They rush him to hospital, and when they arrive he cannot get out of the car by himself.


They do testing, and there's heroin in his bloodstream.


Kid says he didn't do anything.


The way I see it:


1) No-one is going to freely distribute a class A drug.


2) He didn't shoot up, would've immediately been high and obvious


3) Wasn't the drink either. Should take around 45 minutes to an hour for the drug to show up in your bloodstream and effects start to kick in. The parents would have noticed.


4) had to be some sort of capsule (it has been suggested that the colon takes longer to absorb the stuff, might have entered that way, explains the timing - and I remember something like this from Trainspotting) - this theory has now been ruled out. Suppositories would have the drug take effect more quickly than most other ways.


5)... or the test results might be wrong (which I doubt)


Please tell me I am wrong and the kid is telling the truth.


I would really appreciate any help. 

It's just a kid... Thanks in advance.",1410588472.0

I have been clean for 2 years. Recently I posted about how I knew I was going to pick up soon; recently have been through some traumatic relationship stuff. I have been scouring all of the low places is this city: strip clubs (scored xanax off of a stripper), needle exchanges, homeless hang outs, etc. Today it finally paid off and a girl showed me ""the spot"".

I gave her 40$ and I knew she might run off with it. She did. No matter. One of the benefits off of being clean for two years is homeboy's got a bank account these days. At least now I knew the spot. I went up to one guy, he pointed me towards a girl. I saw her selling dope to people but she wouldn't sell to me. Then it hit me. I look healthy, clean, and really to be quite honest. Like a cop. 

Another sketchy character came up to me and said. ""Hey man everyone here thinks you're a cop but I can spot an abscess scar from a mile away"". I showed him my arms, there are a couple of abscess scars on them. This guy managed to spot them from about 50 feet away. Junkies always surprise me. Anyways he convinces the girl I am not a cop. She said sorry. I bought two bags. Said I would come back if I liked it. She said ""That's some strong gunpowder, be careful"".

I have never seen ""gunpowder"". It looks like soil. It also has some reflective binding agent or something that it was cut with. It has been two years and I don't plan on going straight to IV. I have seen too many friends die from being clean for x amount of time and going back straight to the needle. So I am just curious if anyone has any experience with this stuff?

While I have been able to vape some small amounts from foil, the amount of effort and time spent just to get any kind of buzz over the 30mgs of methadone I'm on is too much to bother. I'm thinking if I could just get it to harden properly, it would vape/smoke with much less effort, and I wouldn't need to literally spend an hour at it continuously just to catch a minor buzz. 

Anyone experienced chiming in would be pretty awesome but I'd settle for educated speculation right about now. It's Friday night and I want to get ripped and play harmonica for a few hours then nod. 

Plus this shit smells so much like barbeque sauce or something, like a sweet, meaty smell, it's almost impossible to believe this is the same stuff that gave off such a rank old socks smell when it was cooking down.

I thought I should feel better by now?,"Well I ran out of money so I had to go cold turkey off A 6 month everyday H binge. I use gabapentin for withdrawals and it takes away everything along with a little loperamide. I didn't even get much lope, only 48 mg over 4 days, but I couldn't shit for a few more days. 

On the second night, I took a psychedelic combo by licking old empty bags of 2c-I and 5-MeO-MiPT (one gram  bag each) which ended up being quite a trip. I took ~70 mg MXE near the tail end and fixed ALOT of things in my life. I even reconnected with my dad after 7 years. Since then, I have had few real cravings for opioids. I had 60$ last night to go buy Dabs and met a dude selling 10 lortab 10's for 40$. I didn't even consider it. Not much if an urge at all, but I did call some friends because that is a good deal!

 But now that I have been weening off my gabapentin, I feel like my opioid withdrawal symptoms are returning (watery eyes, back ache, yawning,RLS, slight diarrhea, and extreme chills. I don't understand, my previous withdrawals never lasted so long.

My hypotheses:

1. MXE in high doses has been cited to have mu opioid activity, although recent studies have tried to refute that (I'm not convinced).

2. I am withdrawing from loperamide and am only experiencing peripheral symptoms. Mentally I have felt great and in a positive mood even after I started weening the gabapentin.

Today I woke up with terrible terrible pain in my lower stomach, more on the right side. My mom takes me to the er. They've already tested my blood and urine, and think it's my appendix or my gall bladder. If it's either of those it will mean surgery to have it removed. I'm waiting on a CT to determine. 

Besides the fact I'm fucking terrified of surgery, I'm concerned with pain and how it will be dealt with.

DEBATE my minions!,"In regards to cotton fever, *some* people say it's a myth, *some* people say it's not. Is it caused by *cotton*? Is it caused by *bacteria* in your shot that induces a mild form of *sepsis*, etc?   
  
I feel this is a conversation and a question *ripe* for debate for /r/opiates, and I'm posting this in an effort to stimulate intelligent name cal...I mean...conversation, because frankly, I love you motherfuckers that much and would love to see this community thrive a little more and evolve into something more than name calling and simple semantics. Our sister sub could use some love as well, but considering the population, I thought I'd start this here :)   
  
Here's my take, and this is from firsthand experience. Given then nature as well, it's a rather short response compared to others I've given in other forums.  
  
 I firmly believe that ""*cotton fever*"" is caused by *bacteria* that makes its way into your shot, *one way or another*, not necessarily because *you're* filthy, but because a *little bit of filth* made its way into your shooting zone, whether your arm, your rig, spoon, the cotton, and maybe even the pill/dope could've came into contact with something nefarious, and this *sweet little filth baby* breeds inside you and causes you to experience a mild form of sepsis. It can happen directly after doing your shot if it's the *rambunctious* sort, or hell, it can even manifest an hour later if it's more on the *lazy* side. Over the years, I've been *lucky* enough to experience *both* methods of being invaded by the dreaded cotton fever filth babies!  
  
Now, in regards to a cure, some say there is none, that you have to sweat, freeze, shiver, puke, roll around until you pass out from the incredible pain from your increasingly tense muscles spasming like a painful, neverending full body orgasm. The only way to escape the dreaded fever, is to sleep it off..  
  
HERE, is where I disagree, and mind you, this would be rather precise, and may not work for everyone, but after a long, long, hiatus, the dreaded fever has reared it's ugly face at me, not once today, but **TWICE**.  
  
What did I do you say? I procured a new pill, a new, unused syringe, a spoon rubbed down with alcohol, and a lighter. Not everyone heats their shots, and some may even frown upon it, but I do so to assist in breaking it up. I don't *cook* my pill/dope, just a light heating of the water and I'm done with it. I sterilized a fresh injection site, swabbing from the inner to outer zone, and proceeded with my injection.   
  
Within moments, moments I tell you, I was cured...CURED from the dreaded fever I say! I did this on both occasions with 100% success.  
  
NOW, this goes without saying, you got it once, you can get it again using the same gear and undergoing the very same procedures that got you into it to begin with. This MAY, and CERTAINLY has the potential to make it worse if done incorrectly or you're extremely unlucky. I got it the second time hours later while doing a wash, and reusing a syringe I failed to dispose of earlier, after the initial infection.  (against my own advice, mind you, so this was my own damn fault) That said, *dispose of all your old gear, water included, and replace everything before attempting a new shot.*  
  
Every.single.time. I've done this, my cotton fever has been cured. It is is very real, and IMO, there is a remedy. This is it.

I was staying at my mothers for 8 months from January to August and only used like, 6 times while there. I used too close together my last week there and while I was planning on starting over clean in NJ..i started getting sick.

Turns out, the girl working at my job was a dope head.. (yay/booo) and for some reason, she smokes ecp?? I don't know why..i tried it but i definitely think its a waste compared to shooting or snorting. Anyways, I copped from her a few times..and now, fast forward to the present..I have used daily for the last three weeks or so.

I have done anywhere from 5 or 6 bags to a bundle and a half for three weeks and I can't fucking stop. I keep getting to the 24 hour sober mark and then the sweats n chills set in and I give in and cop. Finding cheap bags doesn't help either cause it has just made my tolerance go up like crazy.

This is ridiculous. I don't see it ever getting better because I work for my dad and due to people getting fired/quitting (including the girl that I did dope with) I now work 7 days a week and lets be honest…Im not going to go through intense withdrawal while serving uppity people lattes and cappuccinos. 

I don't know what the point of this post is, i guess I am just venting but I am literally going crazy and losing all hope with each day I use. I am making a shit load of money at work, which is about the only positive thing I can say about my life right now. I have no social life, I just work all day then come home and hang out w my dog and watch marathons of Cops on tv.

I can't handle this anymore
I did 13 bags today in the span of 5 hours and it isn't even fun anymore. Im high and its boring almost.
But at least I'm not sick I guess

She was having problems with snorting pills and her nose/ sinuses getting irritated.

  So basically I showed her that she could break down her roxies or whatever with water and then draw it up with a rig that has the needle broken off and with out the filtering with a cotton part. Then just tilt your head back and use the rig to put the solution up your noise. I'm pretty sure it would be the most effective if you do this until you start to feel it in the back of your throat and then wait a few minutes to let the membrane thing  absorb the solution and then just repeat.  

So yea she told me that her nose has been feeling much better and that she thinks this method is actually more effective than just snorting the powder. I guess its possible that the solution covers the membrane more evenly which might allow for faster absorption but I'm not really educated enough on the subject to make that claim. 

TL/DR- just make monkey water with your pills and use a rig with the needle broken off and your nose will be happier. :)",1410646030.0

Looking over it now, I don't think I can bring myself to do that, but I felt like it should be read by *somebody* anyway. Maybe someone out there who's still in the same place I was, struggling to get out, will find something they can hold on to in this letter. On the other hand, maybe nobody will care and it'll get downvoted into oblivion. Either way, I needed to get this hundred-pound beast off my chest - so here it is. What follows is an uncensored and unedited (except to remove names) letter from a recovering addict to the people he hurt. I don't know that I'll give it to the people I wrote it for, but maybe some of you will get something out of it.

Here goes:

Sometimes in this crazy world of ours, saying 'sorry' isn't good enough. In these cases, we usually force a smile and act as though we'll forgive and forget, allowing the apology to have its intended effect of the person giving it feeling some semblance of peace in spite of their actions. In such instances, the word 'sorry' can feel like more of a slap in the face than an admission of regret. Sometimes we might forgive, but when someone has (repeatedly, in this case) done something deplorable, we certainly never forget.

That's why I'm writing this letter.

I'm now about three months 'clean,' and the Subutex therapy seems to be working well. I haven't had any craving for opiates in weeks, and my incessant drug-lust has seemingly been satiated. And yet, months after I apologized to you, I still feel like the scum of the earth. Why?

Because sorry isn't good enough, and even if you've truly forgiven me, I'm damn sure you haven't forgotten what I've done. Hell, *I wouldn't forgive and forget about my behavior if I was you.* This letter doesn't change any of that, of course; maybe the purpose of this letter is equal parts apology and self-therapy. I live with these thoughts every hour of every day, and I'm being crushed under their immensity.

I've apologized before on numerous occasions; I've told [redacted] I was sorry for the times I chose drugs instead of spending time with her. I've expressed my regret for always finding my pills, no matter where [redacted] hid them. I've said how sorry I was for the years of my life (and yours) that I threw away by spending them with my head in the fentanyl clouds. 

I've apologized numerous times for all these things - and yet none of you even realize how bad things really got. I never told you about the times I tore the entire house apart looking for my hidden pills because the two you set out for me weren't enough. I didn't tell you that I had to take around eight Vicodin just to feel normal. I sure as hell never mentioned the time I put on 400mcg/hour of Fentanyl patches, hoping I'd die - only to find that my tolerance was so high that it didn't kill me.

I could go on forever about how bad things were, but this was intended to be a letter, not a great American novel, so I'll keep things more brief. 

Sorry isn't good enough. I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I need it. As you know, I'm in recovery now, and my stashes of fentanyl, oxycodone, and Vicodin are swimming happily at the bottom of our septic tank. The cravings and withdrawals are gone thanks to the Subutex, and yet I realize now that the most important part of my recovery is this letter. I don't know if I wrote it more for me or for you, truth be told, but I want to emphasize the key point here regardless.

*I know it isn't good enough to just say this, but I'm truly sorry for everything that my addiction put you through. I don't expect you to forget what I've done, but in time I hope you can forgive it.*",1410624515.0

The worst part is being so drowsy that I couldn't drive to pick up.

I was actually so drowsy that I was having a hard time finding my methadone pills. I was stumbling around like an idiot, tearing through my purse trying to find it. I had 10mg in my hand but it never made it to my mouth. I suddenly woke up again, not even sure how long I napped for and finally took 20mg and slept a little bit.

I have an internal temp of 98.4!!! I don't know what the hell is going on but it's unbearably cold. Like worse than any flu or withdrawal chills I have had before. Is this normal by any means? 


I did use gabapentin to kick and have just ran out, but I have never vet felt this aweful after a gabapentin mediate withdrawal before. I am seriously considering going to pick up just to see if it helps!!! I remember this happening to me one other time, I think I was using during this time and it didn't really help, but I could at least maybe force myself to work with some opioids! I really have no cravings for them though, just been laying in my bed all morning trying to think of what I could do to get relief from being so damn cold. It also happened Friday and Sunday morning, but it was not as severe or long-lasting. This is so weird.

UPDATE: Well I took 11g of kratom pills from the gas station and started feeling fantastic, wow my tolerance disappeared quick! I got high from the kratom before my chills went away so I am sceptical as to whether my chills were alleviated by that or by the massive burger king meal I destroyed. I didn't realize I was THAT hungry, it felt almost insatiable once I started eating lol. After an order of chicken fries and a big king, I oddly am still hungry. I guess I should find somethig healthy and not fast food shit though.

Actually I am still having the chills a little bit, but the kratom covered it up mostly an got me flying high! I wish i wouldn't have used any opioids, but the $20 I spent on kratom and food was definitely worth more than what I woulda got driving to pick up $20 worth of H. Why do I even bother with heroin, kratom gives me the same feeling I crave (not much of a ""nodder"" personally). I am gonna try not to do more kratom but I am gonna order more just in case as the $8 ounces of high quality kratom is sooo much cheaper than the overpriced gas station pills and obviously than heroin.

2gflqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2gflqb/i_think_my_sub_doc_is_a_quack_help/,12,https://redd.it/2gflqb,bonejohnson8,I think my sub doc is a quack - help,"I'm 28, I've been doing opiates for 11 years straight (well, who would be that lucky to never suffer a drought! I got clean a thousand times and my body feels calloused to withdrawal at this point.)  I recently started going to a psychiatrist.   I ended things with a girl that was enabling me to use (a girl my friends would say ""knock up, her parents have millions"") and got over the fear I had that I would not be a success unless I had her to fund my grandeur or delusions thereof.  My cat of 15 years and really only best friend left is dying in front of me and depressingly, I have to play doctor with little money, no job, and try to keep him alive.  I still live with my mother, our house is being foreclosed on, but we are not completely underwater.  My mothers best-friend live-in boyfriend who was like a father to me died in front of me a few months ago, and I delivered the eulogy.  I tried to give him CPR and his last breath he puked into my mouth.  I can still taste the taste of death.   It's been fucked up.   I probably need some real therapy, but we are men! we have drugs and google!   So I started seeing a psychiatrist because basically, I feel like this is the year I will have to lose everything.

Initially I just wanted to stop blowing ten blues a day.  I couldn't afford it and the streets couldn't afford me.  I wouldn't resort to stealing and all that, and tried to believe in some honor amongst thieves.  Having been robbed a dozen times myself, I just don't have it in me to do that to anybody.  So I started sub, for the 3rd time in my life.  

My doctor gave me 10 pills and said tell me how many you need to feel alright.  I prob could have gotten 32mg a day out of him.  I told him 16mg made me feel fine, but I had panic attacks (simply to score some benzos.)  In my area, 8mg of sub can go for 20 dollars.  So in my head, I just scored 1200 dollars a month.   He never drug tested me.  I would use the sub to dry out, top out at 4mg doses, and then use the rest to be the Oxy supplying vampire amongst my friends.   Many burnt bridges later, and now single for about 4 weeks, I've been evaluating myself.  Who the fuck am I?  A bum junkie living off his broke mom?   She deserves better.   (SIDE NOTE: The HBO show The Leftovers helped inspire me to do this next part, as I went back to sub the day of it's finale) 

So,  I've made it a whole week on sub.   I have money in my pocket.  One day I spent a hundred bucks on whippits just because I needed to spend my money or I was going to try and get high.  Every day there is a vulnerable 15 minutes where people are calling me to score.  And I've made my phone calls.  I'm only on sub for a whole week thanks to the lack of stuff around.  I could get H, but I haven't touched it since 21 when a friend died, sort of an agreement I made with God.  

My doctor is prescribing me anything under the sun.  I feel like the kid in that movie Charlie Bartlett, playing pharmacist to my friends.   Neurontin,  Ambien (which i do about 70-100mg of the day I get, like a mad man), kpins, 16mg sub, and recently Effexor.   The Effexor did something, but the more I learned about it, I decided to stop taking it.  I don't think I'm clinically depressed, but probably a bipolar addict.  

What meds work for you guys?  I want this sub stint to work.  I don't want to keep going back.  I could prob get this guy to prescribe me viagras, seroquels, depakotes, fucking anything, he doesn't give a shit if he is paid.   I don't want to abuse it, but it is HARD.

My sex drive came back a few months ago when I tapered myself down from 60mg of methadone daily to 10mgs. I've been using for the past few months ever since I got down to 10mgs (I stopped taking methadone and use BTH whenever I can). I've dated a few guys, but whenever I tell them about this part of my life, they typically don't stick around.

There's someone I recently reconnected with that I really like. I think we are drawn to each other because we're both lonely and in pain. He was my best friend when I was much younger, but we grew apart. He's experienced with substances, but not hard drugs (like meth and opiates). He's an alcoholic because of PTSD. He wants to cut back on his drinking and I want to not be physically dependent on opiates. We have been honest to each other about our addictions.

I just don't want him to see me dope sick. I don't want him to see me shitting, puking, and sweating. I don't want to spend a night at his place and have to sneak off to use so that I don't fucking shit myself. The last time I spent the night with him, I thought it would be fine because I was going to leave in the morning. He insisted on going out for brunch and I was so sick I couldn't eat. He's pretty understanding about my addiction, but he doesn't really understand what it's like to be dope sick. How do people date non-users?

Edit: I have a lot of mixed feelings about dating right now. I want to date because I'm extremely lonely. However, I'm afraid of my addiction hurting someone (again). I'm afraid of being asked/pressured to quit. I'm afraid of being vulnerable. But I just don't want to be alone anymore.

Last edit:
Thank you all for the advice. I love this subreddit. You guys are awesome! Even though I really like this guy, I've decided to not pursue a relationship with him. Maybe when we are both sober, I will revisit that idea. Right now, I'm just going to be his friend (maybe friends with benefits??)",1410742962.0

In my experience I am happy to pay these fees for the short term loans they represent. Far better than your local mafia shark or otherwise, these less than 1k ""loans"" of overdrafting are a godsend my addiction. Recently I have been cut off for in my mind using the bank against its own purpose. (I'm temporarily holding THEIR money for MY PURPOSES rather than the other way around). 

Of course there are fees associated, but these are so much better and more limited than awful interest structures of say, payday loans or loan sharks. If you can do it, just overdraft your deal and do as much as you can, the fees are usually the same. In fact many banks (such as ally) apparently are very lenient on these matters and the fee is very nominal. For me, I take a 36 dollar hit on each overdraft but that means to me make the most out of each one, so I always make sure it is for the maximum allowable amount. 

In this case, I thought I was cut off, but was in fact able to overdraft 375. Plus my cash on hand this has made for an amazing score for me tonight pending dealer availability- I am hopeful this will score me a whole brick to myself or close to it :D. I had been looking at a lot of alternatives, I do have very good credit (725+) which may be the only reason this is possible, but I say to all, AVOID THOSE PAYDAY LOANS IF YOU CAN. Don't forget overdraft as an option. That is  all peace and happy nods.

edit 2: Backstory... just prior to this I have spent about a week in minimal sub use and recently decided *fuck it * and took my moms 10 remaining percocet (5/325,print 512) she hasnt used since 2008 and ate them all to feel better, replacing them with tylenols that looks sort of similar.
